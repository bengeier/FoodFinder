{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. The first time, I drove-through ordered the 4 for 4 meal, and the employee almost sent me home without giving me my drink. Not a big deal, but then when I got home I found that my 4 for 4 meal was a 3 for 4, as there was no burger in my bag. Went back today and again the drive through employee tried sending me of without my drink. When I asked for my sprite, I got an eye roll instead of an apology, and a cup full of carbon water."}
{"text":"I love ordering ice coffee from Wendy's because their coffee is larger than anyone other fast food joints. The medium is Macdonalds large cup.    I feel that it's worth my money."}
{"text":"Eh. Slow service but hot food. Slow service just irks me. We were literally the only people in the restaurant. There's really no excuse for slow service when there's only two of us."}
{"text":"Went into Wendys on state. They had very rude customer service. Their employees look like they are strung out on drugs. My baconator had 1 strip of bacon. Meat wasn't cooked fully and fries had 5 times too much salt. There should be a quality rating restaurants should have to be allowed to be on state or the capital square. I will no longer go to Wendy's on state again."}
{"text":"Service is slow, staff is uncaring and food has gone down hill recently. Used to really like this place - not anymore."}
{"text":"I have been here many times during the lunch rush. They have my food waiting as soon as I pull up to the window before I can even get my wallet out (super fast) and they have always gotten my food correct! The line goes fast.  Kudos to your lunch teams! You guys rock!"}
{"text":"This location is a total disgrace. I stopped in here to check out the dining room renovations and grab a quick sandwich, and I was not impressed. The new dining room is modern looking but very cramped and uncomfortable, and the service is some of the worst I have ever experienced at a fast food restauant. There were only a few orders ahead of mine, and what should have been a 3 or 4 minute wait at most turned into 15 minutes for them to make one sandwich. Workers were standing around the whole time doing nothing and looking completely dumb and clueless, staring helplessly at the computer screens in front of them. I am not exaggerating, it was that bad. Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"Wendy's has always been a \"go to\" food choice for this Yelper, but today was my first bad experience at the Summerlin location. The \"kid\" working the drive-thru window is a thief... 1) He did not provide me with total after I ordered at the speaker so I could have my money ready, 2) when we got to the window he informed me of the total ($15.44), watched me count out $16 (2x $5, 6x $1), 3) he took the money and put it directly in to the cash drawer without counting it, 4) he then informed his manager that I only gave him $15 and made me give even more money to him because he was adamant that I under-changed him.   If $15 dollars was received, he should have re-counted it in front of me to show me how much I gave him instead of putting it directly into the cash drawer. Instead he was unable to \"prove\" how much money was actually given and I was still forced to fork over more money than I needed to. Bad business practices!   Word of warning to visitors of this Wendy's when a white 20-something yo kid is working the window: make sure to count your money twice before having to pay more than you need to. The customer is NOT always right at this location."}
{"text":"Great service!!!  Everything is clean and very friendly service. Deville, especially, is a real asset to this location. Good for a quick stop. I came here with my young family. He was so friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Would give this particular branch no stars if possible. Ordered two meals for my wife and myself and was informed the soda fountain wasn't working (after we had paid). We each had iced tea instead.Halfway through eating we tried to get refills on our beverages and were told we would have to purchase new drinks because refills are free for soda only. I tried to reason with the employee and then the manager that we only accepted iced tea as a substitute for soda because they were unable to deliver the drinks we had purchased but was met with rote company policy and a general air of \"if you don't like it, don' eat here\". Which is exactly what i intend to do."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is better if you walk in vs. the drive thru. The last two times I went through the drive thru, my order was incorrect. The people are friendly though. I will return to this location. Just have to make sure I check my order before leaving."}
{"text":"After we walked in and saw that the store closes in 30 minutes I was going to leave but Liz ensured us that we were more than welcome to order. I ordered it to go and she said we didn't have to but we did anyway. This was the cleanist Wendy's I have been in and the staff was extremely friendly. They even threw out old fries and made us new ones!! I am traveling through on a trip from Oklahoma to Niagara Falls and back to Oklahoma and I would recommend this Wendy's to anyone in the area!! Great Customer Service Liz!!!"}
{"text":"This is a horrible Wendy's.  Service is okay, but the quality of food is lousy.  I just took two chicken sandwiches to the bird feeder!  The buns were dry and stale.  And, the once good chicken, isn't the same.  I won't go there again.  Other fast food at least gives a fresh bun!  Horrible and maybe edible, but I fed it to stray animals  Got in my car and went to Rosarios where I know the food it fresh.  No more Wendy's for me.."}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru line for over twenty minutes and there was only one car in front of me. Got home and realized they gave me the wrong drink and sandwich. Not recommended at all"}
{"text":"Wow rude service. The guy taking our order missed half of our order (mistakes happen) but was aloof and rude. Disappointed especially for being in this area. Food is fast food so just as expected. In this day and age if you can't give good service close down. Some other chain should replace it."}
{"text":"Alright so those commercials on tv about the pub style pretzel burgers got to me and needed to try it.  This location is not the nicest but not the worst I've been to.  The older lady at the counter was super nice and even asked me how my day was going, which was a pleasant surprise and refreshing.  Normally you get some kid that has no clue and is there just to enter orders.  Anyways the pretzel burger, I was thinking that it may be a bit heavy but the bun was actually light and flavorful.  The sauce with this burger has a slight sweetness and balances the savory sins of bacon and cheese.  Can't comment on the fries as I just wanted to try the burger out.  I would get it again."}
{"text":"Fat lady working the drive through left her mic on and heard her tell her old man boss, \"you need to tell your people how to talk to people\". I'll come back when you replace your idiot, racist, low wage, front line with robots."}
{"text":"Ordered the #10 which is the chicken nuggets, I didn't think of it at the time of ordering but I actually wanted the spicy nuggets which they were so quick to change my order to what I wanted. The fries were hot and I got the all natural lemonade, which one thing about Wendy's their not shy about putting and excess amount of ice. And the all time favorite Frosty is always tasty!"}
{"text":"Prices on drive-thru menu are lower than the prices they ring up.  Just had to have price corrected again.  Every time I am forced to take a picture of the menu board so the manager will honor the price posted.  Sad sad way too treat your customers."}
{"text":"Terrible service n management. Things were just handled in a very poor manner w lack of management experience. I visited Wednesday 8/23/2017 around 6pm or so."}
{"text":"Extremely rude woman works the drive thru.  She was so rude to me the car behind me said \"Oh, GD No!\" and left.  Someone decent took over for her and handled the rest of my order, but I will not be returning.  The orders are usually wrong and having to deal with a rude staff member is just too much.  There are multiple food eateries on this road, I would recommend to my friends to choose any of these other well known chains over this location.  There is a reason there is no line here and an empty parking lot...."}
{"text":"OMG...Stay away. Employees are so RUDE. They do not like to accept coupons, and treat you like a \"Low Life\" for using them. I will NEVER return to a Wendy's & I will tell all family & friends to stay away. I cannot believe these kind of rude employees are asking for $15.00 an hour. This place doesn't even deserve the to be allowed to be open. Nasty Place."}
{"text":"Service was as expected and order was correct,  but I wish I could give zero stars as I found what appears to be a human toenail clipping in the chili!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. This is by far the worst Wendy's ever! Super slow service, employees don't care about customers, always seem to be understaffed. If you want to wait 30min for your meal then go ahead. You are better off finding another Wendy's location or just ordering takeout from the multiple burger restaurants around this area. I have emailed them multiple times and heard nothing back. I have heard while waiting inside from multiple other people that this is the worst Wendy's they have ever been to. Wendy's corporate needs to come in here and do something about this store to get it back to Wendy's quality and fast service!"}
{"text":"My chicken sandwich was sloppy looking and the place needed the floors cleaned and touchscreen soda dispensers were very dirty. The only thing that saved this experience was the chili bowl that I recommend. Just take drive through."}
{"text":"Along with the conjoined Tim Horton's the dining area of this Wendy's has been upgraded which is nice.  In general you can't go wrong with a spicy chicken or a couple JBC's from Wendy's.   I find their hours leave something to be desired, closing at 1am."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would ever review a fast food but this Wendy deserves it! It was the best customer service welcoming second I walked in. I have never been more impressed by a cashier before, and just made everyone she talked with leave in a better mood. The location is great and food was fantastic. Very impressive."}
{"text":"great fine dining. Awkward looking kid with glasses offered great conversation. Manager fat as fuck. love it. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Horrible Horrible service. It was like we were bothering them. I don't understand. I work customer service everyday and I know how to treat customers,  not here. I will never go eat here again, and would never recommend this Wendy's to anyone. The management needs to seriously look at how people are being treated here. Then when the food finally came the order was all wrong,  I didn't even bother to let them know."}
{"text":"My daughter picked up food on the way home last Monday evening.  While her food was hot, mine was inedible.  The fries were not just cold and tough, they were slightly shriveled from sitting so long.  I gave them two stars only because my daughter's meal was good (for fast food).  My hamburger was also cold (the meat itself), soggy bun, and one sorry-looking skinny red onion ring (as well as normal ketchup, mustard, pickle) was on the burger.   As there was no receipt provided (to do their survey as a method of complaint), I did place a complaint with their corporate office and did receive a call from a very polite and apologetic manager who volunteered to replace my food and my frosty.  I explained that I felt his crew did not provide a receipt so a bad survey could not be done, and they hoped that we would just not say anything.  (Surveys are a ridiculous way for businesses to evaluate performance.  Too easy for fraud.)  Anyway, when a Wendy's craving hits, I will give this location another chance.  Since we will be redeeming a complaint next visit, I'm sure everything will be fine.  The visit after that will reflect whether or not this is a location worth spending money at."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I been to. Its a very slow hr few cars in the drive tru & a couple in dinning room... The dinning room was a mess while the whole staff in kitchen talking & laughing the restaurant looks messy never coming back to this Wendy's"}
{"text":"Came through the drive thru and had a large but simple order. Specifically, the #8, Asiago chicken sandwich. I ordered one with no lettuce, no sauce and add pickles and told them make two more exactly the same. 20 min later when I get home I see that not only were they wrong, they were all different. When I went back, the cashier wasn't able to help, so the manager, who didn't seem to know what each sandwich was made of, tried to figure out my simple order.  After she reordered it, the girl from the kitchen came up and asked again, adding lettuce. I said no lettuce! Then when it was done, the manager double checked, and they still were wrong. Come on Wendy's! They also gave us the wrong drink but we just left that one alone."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!! Do not eat here! I just got a sandwhich and the bread had mold! Their fries arent even cook throughly and they took forever to give me my order on top of that"}
{"text":"In town for the NASCAR race and stopped here to eat lunch.  The food was ok-typical Wendy's fare. The counter girl, however, was terrible. Didn't great us when we walked in and acted like we were bothering her asking for anything. If her manager ever sees this, she really needs an attitude adjustment!!"}
{"text":"Typical Wendy's fate. HORRIBLE service. The staff here all seemed to be operating in slow motion and in a state of drug addled confusion. WTF?!"}
{"text":"I went not even 10 minutes ago, the girl taking my order was super rude,my food was super cold, and my Dr Pepper was flat! I hardly ever go out but this is ridiculous! This was the second time I tried this location since it's most convenient to me but this place needs to straighten up!  What's the point of going out if you have to heat up the damn food!"}
{"text":"Just got totally ripped off at the drive-thru.  Ordered a half salad and a medium drink.  Got charged for a chili, burger + premium drink with extra shot of flavor and extra cheese on the chili. Thought the price was high, but was crunched for time and don't have the ability to go back for several hours to complain.  At that point, and even now, it will be my word against worker as to what I ordered.  Although I did receive exactly what I asked for, rather than the food reflected on the receipt."}
{"text":"Great music. Service is highly variable, but this is a selling point. Trips to Wendy's are always unique, and when you're here, you really are family. The 4 for $4 truly is groundbreaking.  Can't recommend this location enough."}
{"text":"What the f@$£ I went to get some of the pretzel hamburgers they are advertising and after making us wait for their service we got told the don't have pretzel buns....if your advertising something and promoting it it's supposed for u to have them available....lame store"}
{"text":"Tanesia screwed up my drive-through order. The receipt was correct but one order of fries was missing. When I got home I saw that I hadn't received what I'd paid for so I called. I requested that $2.19 be credited back to my credit card but the person with whom I spoke refused to do so unless I drove there in person. I replied that I had no intention of wasting more time and would dispute the charge with my credit card company.  I can't recommend this poorly run restaurant. There are many other options nearby."}
{"text":"I was there the other night, 20 minutes til close...they were out of mayo, ketchup, lettuce, tomato, iced tea and baked potatoes...what's left to order?  Just close early..."}
{"text":"Service:  Great. The servers at the drive thru were nice, and our food was ready for us when we got to the window.   Price:  $10 for two burgers is pretty expensive.. not including drinks or a combo.   Food:  We got two of the new ciabatta bacon cheeseburgers, and I thought they were really good. I probably won\t buy it again though, just because of the price."}
{"text":"I enjoy Wendy's, and my burger was amazing. It was a very clean burger and restaurant. Unlike McDonalds, but one very small problem is I told the girl working there no onions or tomatoes but she put both on. Like are you kidding me! overall I enjoyed it I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's food. However, the service and workers at this location is absolutely horrible! I am currently standing at the counter waiting for my food while 3 employees have a conversation containing profanity and disrespect to other guests. One young lady, with her hair all over her head,  looking and sounding very unprofessional states how she \"can't stand when people order their food in the drive thru then comes inside to complain about it.\" (She was referring to the guest in line before me who walked away). This store needs serious training for their employees. I live in the neighborhood and love Wendy's so that's the only reason I come here. I only give 2 stars for the food. If give zero for guest experience if I could.  By the way, it is currently 3:25pm on April 1, 2016. Perhaps management could take note of who was at work and take the necessary action to ensure no other guests feel as uncomfortable as I do right now."}
{"text":"The place is a TOTAL wreck! I paid for a large Frosty and look what I got when I opened the lid!? Aint that a b****"}
{"text":"Alright. Let m just say this. I haven't gone to this Wendy's during the day but night shifts around 7 through closing is horrible. I have came to this location several times just because it is on my way home from work. First off, everytime I come to this location I am waiting 5 to 10 minutes just for someone to take my order through the drive thru. They don't seem to care what customers think of them hen taking orders because everytime they sound like they just woke up from a nap. My food came out fast this time, it usually takes a good 5 minute to get two burgers, fries and drinks. But once I got the window less than 30 seconds it was out. Yes, it would of been nice if what I got was fresh but it wasn't because it wasn't even warm. I got cold salty fries, lukewarm burgers and room temperature nuggets. Once I had eaten my food shortly after my boyfriend and I both had to make several trips to the bathroom. This Wendy's always seems to make my stomach hate me after eating here. So I suggest health department checks this place out. Because it really is only this Wendy's I get sick at. I recommend this Wendy's to nobody! Unless you want bad customer service, long waits and food that will upset your tummy. I would have given you no stars Wendy's but unfortunately I don't have that option."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's.  Worst I have ever been.  The trash dump is right next to the drive thru the smell is beyond nauseous.    Staff are clueless."}
{"text":"The food is good and the restaurant is clean. BUT if you plan on eating in make sure you have your winter parka with you. I mean really, it's January and 69 degrees outside. I was wearing my North Face jacket and I was literally shaking inside the building because the air conditioning was so cold. It is my understanding the manager has no regard for his guests and keeps it that cold to please himself. I should not have to chug down a meal so fast just to get outside where it is warmer. We had the car heater on all the way home to warm up. Sorry but we won't be back to this location and I will make sure I let all my friends know how unpleasant a place it is to eat in."}
{"text":"I'm gonna say a few things here.  The things that should be the most important at a fast food restaurant (besides the obvious options and food quality). Every order correct. Every order complete. All food hot.  What more do you want.  Wendy's has their act together. Period."}
{"text":"I used to go to this one frequently when it was the only fast food near my house. I moved away, and came back, and this Wendy's has gone down hill. It's still not terrible, but the service takes longer than it used to, and the food is clearly not freshly made. I realize most fast food isn't, but at least make it look like it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp for the last few hours."}
{"text":"This one is ok. I have learned over the years to always check my order in the drive thru no matter what place it is. I realize fast food is a starter job, (hey I worked at Pizza Hut), but the \"kids\" that work here need a punch in the mouth or a firing. Or both."}
{"text":"I really, really like Wendy's food.  I truly am a fan.  This location is literally less than five minutes from my office.  Am I a regular here, where they know my face if not my name?  No.  Why?  Because I can't get a simple order delivered correctly!  Today, it was an Asiago Chicken Club sandwich (homestyle please, not spicy or grilled) and a value fries.  They got the value fries correct.  Suppose I should give credit where credit is due.  The sandwich?  Instead of Asiago Chicken Club, seems I have a standard Spicy chicken sandwich.  No Asiago cheese, no bacon.   :-(  And I paid more than $6 for an incorrect order!  Makes me sad as I was already having a bad morning.  Why do I keep giving this location another chance????  Definition of stupidity - doing the same thing repeatedly, expecting different results.  Sorry Wendy's (at least this location).  This was likely your last chance."}
{"text":"worst ever 2 weeks ago raw chicken took it back another raw chicken today old tasting ice tea either it was the tea or the ice."}
{"text":"First of all, it's Wendy's, so obviously it's fast food. And it's in a pilot gas station stop so tons of big rigs. But the customer service there is phenomenal. The gentleman in the afternoon, I think his name is Sam, walks around and asks how is your day going and if he can refill your drink. But he sounds so honest when he asks how your doing. There is another gentleman At the cashier, can't remember his name but he remember me After one visit And was very kind and helpful. Good job Wendy's team and management."}
{"text":"Service was alright. The atmosphere was absolutely dreadful. As soon as I walked in, there was a bum laying out on a sofa knocked out with pants that didnt fit and just about showed his nut sack and stunk up half of the restaurant. He was there my entire meal. Soda machine had just about everything out had to settle for some lemonade. Counters for utensils was absolutely dirty was afraid to even wipe my face with the napkins I got. Never again!"}
{"text":"I went to this location for lunch today. I went through the drive thru, and although the line was about seven cars deep I gave my order and received my food in under 8-10 minutes. I have been to this location multiple times and I have had a pleasant experience every time. Nothing has wowed me but I was always satisfied with my food. I would recommend this place if you have a hankering for some fast food."}
{"text":"I am 95% sure I acquired a nasty food based illness here. I ate some of the chicken nuggets, and within 2 hours I was terribly ill, vomiting the entire contents of my stomach into my kitchen sink because I was not able to get to the bathroom.   It was that bad.   As for the service, the 'help' if you can call it that clearly did not want to be working at the place, and I observed several questionable hygiene related issues in regards to how the staff handled themselves - and the food.   How was I able to do this, you ask? Well good reader, the reason is that I was standing for 10 minutes at the counter waiting for my order, a Hamburger, a single order of chicken nuggets, a baked potato, and a large soft drink. I had ample time to observe these things.   I know only the most 'interesting' person would actually enjoy working at a fast food place, but the help here set a new bar of horribleness - if the bar was buried 3 feet into the ground that is.   Add in the for lack of a better term - 'wiped out' dining room which was filthy, and you get fast food hell. Avoid at all costs - go to another Wendy's - any other Wendy's."}
{"text":"Fries were over salted the last 3 times. Very disappointing for me because I generally love Wendy's.  If you can avoid the fries odds are the are extremely salty."}
{"text":"I was treated with absolute respect here and I highly recommend this place. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Food is way below Wendy's usual standards. Dirty restaurant. This is far below the company and Rocky River standards. Should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I didn't catch the bad reviews before my family ordered. It took an extremely long time with 6 orders after us filled before ours which was only two chicken sandwich combos, another chicken sandwich, chicken nuggets and a value fry.   Didn't fill our order correctly. The service wasn't rude, but we weren't rude. The food was good."}
{"text":"Where do I begin???? No one acknowledged us when we walked in although about 3 employees saw us.  It took about 5 minutes before the manager took our order.  A few minutes after I paid, the manager said that I still owed over $2 (because of his mistake in the register).  No apologies.  Employees never smiled.  Will not go back to this branch again."}
{"text":"No idea why the complaints, I've never had a bad experience here in 10 years, came to give 5 stars- it's Wendy's for gosh sakes people bitch about nothing-"}
{"text":"Lets start with negatives. The place is consistently slow. When you order inside they put the orders on the counter but don't even call out a ticket number, so half the time someone else grabs your food. If they do happen to catch this they then act very rude toward the person. This has happened to me and people I've watched.   The food itself is decent though, but that's about all the good there is."}
{"text":"I've never written a review on Yelp before so it really says something about how annoyed I am right now. They missed something on my order and when I went back to the window, they saw me, turned away, and ignored me. I'll never come back."}
{"text":"Out of all the times I have been here, you will either love or (dispise?) the people who work here. Food is consistent but the people, uh, the people who work here either have an attitude 70% or are pleasant 30%."}
{"text":"If the food is not cold then it is microwaved. Definitely, not fresh. The staff is ever changing and once I was charged over the menu price and when I asked for a receipt, the employee then charged the stated menu price. Staff behaves as if it's your fault they have a job they don't enjoy."}
{"text":"The night we came there was one new cashier and about a dozen people wait. I waited about 15 minutes just to order."}
{"text":"Super slow drive thru - 20+ minutes waiting to order. The lady I gave my order to was unpleasant. Would like to finish the review on how the food is, but I'm still sitting at the window waiting for the food."}
{"text":"Attitude big time in the drive thru. I'm assuming she was the manager, she had a black collar shirt and everyone had red tshirts.  Like I'm an inconvenience giving them business during lunch time. No enthusiasm, greeting or courtesy. No offering of other items. After I ordered my first item it was \"ok is that it\" type of sale then I ordered my second item and same thing over and over until I finished my order. Ok your total is ... at the window. No hello or greeting at the window just charged me and gave me my food."}
{"text":"Just ordered 3 hamburger combo meals and when we got home they were not cooked. When I called to let them know, I was told that I must be wrong...their grill is set to cook burgers to a certain temperature, not color and they couldn't be uncooked, I must be wrong. When I suggested that maybe they should check the grill because they definitely weren't cooked, she (Renee) \"informed\" me that it is set properly, she checked it herself today.  I would suggest that they find someone else to check their grill because our burgers aren't cooked properly. Will be emailing the district manager to let him know that customer service at this Wendy's is non-existent! There is another Wendy's on Ellsworth and Baseline with MUCH better service than this...And people think these folks should earn $15 an hr??? With that kind of service...a VERY POOR reflection on the company...they are COSTING the company, not earning it."}
{"text":"Closed the doors 25 minutes early and cussed at my party when we attempted to go into the restaurant to get food. Needless to say, the service was awful and I recommend never going to this store."}
{"text":"Really horrible service lady taking our order had a really nasty attitude plus didnt give out my complete order"}
{"text":"Stopped here to get a burger the other day. I waited for fifteen minutes to have my order taken and then another fifteen minutes after that to get my food. It wasn't even hot when it came out. It wasn't busy there either. There were six other people who were waiting for just as long as I was. I don't expect a lot from fast food but I at least expect to get my food in a timely manner. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Drive up and a very soft voice tells me to go ahead with my order when I am ready.  I give my order and waited for a response.  I had added somethings to my sandwich and assumed the wait time was the person possibly trying to find the right buttons.  Finally I day \"Hello?\" A somewhat annoyed voice told me to go ahead with my order when I am ready.  So I give my order....again.  I pull up to the window to find the girl taking the orders is on her phone..... I am guessing that's why she couldn't pay attention. There were 2 other employees standing around looking at their phones one with a cigarette in his hand.  While it was not lit I found it off putting. I have worked in food and beverage and that is never acceptable.  From one millennial to another, girl put the phone down!  I gave a three because at least my order was correct."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is so bad, that It doesn't even deserve a star rating. But, I will give it the \"Eek! Methinks not\" one star rating. I gave this Wendy's location, THREE chances to \"get it right.\" However, they EPIC FAILED all three times!!!   I love Wendy's Pretzel Chicken Sandwiches and Pretzel Hamburger Sandwiches. And this particular Wendy's is the only one in my neighborhood. On all three, separate visits--I ordered the Pretzel Chicken Sandwich, which they completely botched!  I always order Ranch Dressing, in lieu of their standard Honey Mustard Dressing (which I hate), but I like everything else that traditionally comes on the sandwich--like lettuce, cheese, and tomato.   However, on all three occasions, Wendy's employees failed to get my order correct! The first time, they included the nasty Honey Mustard Dressing on my sandwich and gave me the Ranch on the side, which would have been fine--if they had of left the Honey Mustard off completely. So, I has to go back through the Drive-Thru to return my order.  On the second visit, I even took extra care in explaining to the Cashier exactly how I wanted my sandwich. But of course, my order still wasn't correct. This time, they forgot my fries and put both Honey Mustard and Ranch Dressing on my sandwich.  Needless to say, I had to return my order. This time, I even took it inside and talked to the Manager (who was unapologetic, failed to make it right, and who didn't have any customer service skills herself).   On The third, and FINAL visit, I really didn't want to go to Wendy's, but I was out late and my Car Passenger wanted to go. I told my Guest how awful this Wendy's was, but my Guest still wanted a Wendy's hamburger (and didn't want to go to my choice of Burger Kings).   Again, like I already knew, our orders were a disaster! My chicken sandwich was fried extra hard, and it was just that hard piece of chicken between two pieces of bread (no toppings or dressing). And my passenger's hamburger was a hard, over cooked patty between two slices of bread.  We went back through the Drive-Thru, and talked to the manager. I told her to take a look at those sandwiches. How could someone serve that crap to customers? But the manager just look nonchalant, didn't apologize, and didn't attempt to make it right. Also, we had to pull up and wait a long time to have our money refunded.   Seeing that they can't even get simple orders right, their employees need to be retrained, and so does Management. It is a shame that I can't even support that local business in my community (even after giving them several chances to get things right) because the quality of their food and quality of their service is beyond horrific.  I will never go there again, and in my opinion this location should be shut down--at least for awhile, until they get their employees focused and trained."}
{"text":"Everything was going fine until I got my order . I got my order and I asked the worker if he put ketchup in the bag he said yes so I drive off. When I got home I looked in the bag and found out that they forgot two of the fries so I go back and let them know and they fix they're mistake. However on one of my sandwiches I asked for no sauce what so ever and they placed some on it !? I didn't go back because I'm not about to make another trip to Wendy's for messing up. Oh and another thing I asked for a couple of bbq sauce and got one . The workers were nice just that they need to pay attention to the order more careful."}
{"text":"Wendy's did remodel, but don't worry...all your favorites are still on the menu.  I won't go into the Wendy's menu on this review because if you made it this far you obviously know their food and like it enough to consider reading this review!  The clapped out 80's interior has been freshened up to compete with today's more contemporary fast food restaurants.  Move over McCafe...Wendy's is comin' in hot!  I enjoy the total experience of the facelift, but as a longtime patron of this location I have to give so much praise to the changes made to the restrooms.  I would love to have before and after pictures for you, but I don't...  ...and I will not bore you with a written comparison where I continue to rejoice changes to an area of the restaurant where, unfortunately, many people do not visit before their meal.  The last thing I say about the restrooms is that they were designed by someone who uses them.  Go get a Frosty and some fries to celebrate!  Check it out and let us know what you think!"}
{"text":"I can see why this Wendy's has bad reviews. I just left . Being that they only had 3 cars in line me being the second I had to wait for my food. Got cold fries after having to wait for my food an extra 10 minutes they asked me twice if I wanted BBQ. I got none. And when I asked for BBQ they said they where out . The girl seemed to think it was funny that I said the fries where cold and didn't offer to make new ones. But I mean what can you expect from someone who doesn't seem to like there job.  Oh and I never got my receipt. Probably so I wouldn't call and complain."}
{"text":"Just because this location is in a mall on the Strip doesn't justify charging almost $2 more than other locations in town. That's theft. No wonder no one was there during lunch! Even Subway across the court is reasonable. For what Wendys charges you may as well go to Nordstrom Cafe instead."}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I came here after getting a craving for a Wendy's hamburger for lunch on the weekend.  There were four cars in the drive-thru when we walked inside the restaurant to order.  We got into line and waited while the family in line in front of us ordered.  Then waited longer while others who wanted drink refills got taken care of.  Then the person helping them disappeared somewhere in the back, and didn't come back to the front counter.  In fact, no one came to the front counter to take our orders.  While waiting even longer, I noticed there were at least two employees covering the drive-thru window.  There were three other employees manning the fry station and making hamburgers and other types of food - for the drive-thru orders!.  We waited longer ... A group of five people came in and got in line behind us.  Still no one came to the order counter to help any of us in line, nor did anyone acknowledge that any of us were in line waiting.  I realized that I was in line for over 15 minutes!  Forget this!  I'M OUTTA HERE!  If you come here, I hope you don't have the same bad customer service that I experienced.  But don't be surprised if the employees here make you wait because they have no time to take care of the customers who walk in."}
{"text":"On Friday, June 26, 2013 we were headed to the movies at the Superstition Springs in Mesa.  We decided to eat dinner before the movie and stopped at Wendy's on Hampton instead of the food court in the mall.    We got one kids nugget meal, a baconator combo, an Apple Pecan Chicken salad and a large tea.  When we arrived at the mall, there was no chocolate milk for my daughter's meal and two knives and no fork for my salad.  We couldn't go drive all the way back to the Wendy's to get everything that they forgot.    After the movie we went back to Wendy's with our receipt.  We gave them our receipt and told them that we had been there previously and we did not get our chocolate milk.  They weren't busy, so about 4 employees came to the window.  The MOD said, \"we don't have chocolate milk\".   So we said, \"how about regular milk?\"  We got a milk and they asked if there was anything else we could do.  I asked for my receipt  back.  They looked worried because there is a telephone number on the receipt and it says \"how was your visit\".    Well in the immortal word of Leo Geotz , always check your bag because you get f*@#ed in the drive through........"}
{"text":"Saw some reviews but probably unjust. I love this place. Especially after having a bad experience at another rival location. Bought $25 worth of food that tastes very good!"}
{"text":"It literally just took me an half a hour to order two burgers, two fries, two bottled waters and two ice teas. A half a hour! How? Well, I went over to this place and was met by a woman that could barely speak English and could apparently understand even less. I wondered what the hold up was and I see that the problem was car after car having to explain themselves repeatedly to get their point across.  Yet, this person is handling the drive thru. It is crazy. I mean, I could care less what anyone speaks but if you are running a Wendy's and at the restaurant English speakers are coming in, it would seem to me that you would have someone at the window that speaks English.  Anyway, the Ice tea was cool and the natural cut fries were great. The burger though, well, I think it needs a bit of help. The bacon just left a bad taste in my mouth. All and all I'd say pass on this Wendys."}
{"text":"Gross. I don't remember Wendy's being this bad. Only thing that tasted like food from Wendy's was he frosty. I was starving when I stopped by here and couldn't even finish my food because the food was so bad"}
{"text":"It was pretty average 3 stars seems about right for me. The spicy chicken sandwich barely tasted different than a regular one would. The fries were very splendid however the ranch that you dipped in seemed old"}
{"text":"Experience was very uncomfortable. We were seated near the front counter and the short white woman with glasses and braided hair, who I believe is their boss, starts screaming at her employees and this one manager. I felt bad for him. She wasn't only screaming but she was very unprofessional, saying stuff like \"I don't need your help!\"  The girl working on the kitchen was struggling with orders but the woman just kept on blabbing on and on at the back.  I'm pretty sure there was a better way of handling the situation without flying off the handle in the workplace?   Everyone else working handled it with class and profesionalism. It was almost pathetic to see her treat them that way.  As I'm typing this review she's scolding at one employee who seems to be new. Instead of teaching him she's literally banging equipment and screaming at him. Disgusting."}
{"text":"In a rush in the midst of studying for a final I ordered a salad and a baked potato -- to go. The service was fast, \"great!\", I thought!  But after making the trek all the way back to the library on the other end of campus I unfortunately discovered that they didn't give me any flatware to eat with. When I order two things that are impossible to eat without a fork TO GO forgetting flatware is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Hot and fresh is the motto tho it isn't anymore at this location . Wish I had a torch to at least melt the cheese. Used to be my go to. Smashburger is across and I don't mind spending the $ for better quality. Drink machine is cool tho. The only hot and fresh were the fries I had to wait 10 min for"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is THE BEST!....They used to get my order right all the time when it first opened. But now they get my orders wrong EVERY time, this Wendys is one of my top Go-To-Places when I'm hungry because of that. And we are totally cool They hook me up with lots of food every time I come because they always give me the wrong order.....pretty cool huh Obviously this can backfire if you get waayyy less then what you pay for. But if you get a boss@$$ deal just take it and go haha. I LOVE it how they drop the ball every time I go. I get so much food for less. Good job guys! Keep up the horrible work!"}
{"text":"$8 for a burger and it was MICROWAVED! - Seriously bun and lettuce HOT - 1/2 the cheese stuck to the paper. Dave is rolling in his grave :("}
{"text":"The service was excellent it was super fast and fresh. Really good food for being fast food. Nice job!!!"}
{"text":"I just experienced the worst service ever at the Wendy's in Matthews, NC. Apparently their promotional coupons did not ring up correctly and when we brought it to their attention the cashier stated, \"I can't do anything about it; all I do is push the button\". When we asked to speak to a manager shockingly she had a similar response, \"Ya those coupons have given us trouble for others too, but all I do is push buttons. I can't do anything for you\". The dollar difference was less than $2 so you would think they could have offered us a free frosty to offset the difference, but no!!  When we suggested that or suggested that a call to the owner would likely result in an apology gift card the  manager said, \" Oh ya, they'll give you a $10 gift card\".   Does that make sense to anyone? Create an angry customer who will tell 10 friends about their bad experience rather than correct a known issue. Where do they get these managers?  What kind of customer service training are they giving them?"}
{"text":"Really? Wendy's. This location must be owned by the same owners as the Freedom Drive location in Charlotte. They make you wait 20 minutes at intercom while they only assist one car at a time. The line was wrapped around the building. Then I get bacon so crispy that it was hard as a rock. Then I get Baconater fries with bacon throw on top! This location is becoming a joke. So sad they wasted all that money remodeling, only to open up with a crew who could care less. I won't be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Slowest Wendy's in Charlotte. Seems like they need to work on their operations and efficiency because they're having customers drive away due to long drive thru wait times."}
{"text":"So I stopped here after my less then stellar visit to church's chicken. I was in and out of the drive thru in literally two minutes. I know some people will say well that means nothing is fresh. Well it was hot and it was fast and it was Wendy's. I'm not looking for gourmet. I ordered 2   5 piece spicy nuggets and a new caesar wrap they have. My total was 3 bucks. The nuggets are spicy and the wrap was basically one of their chicken sandwiches cut in half and wrapped up with some lettuce and dressing. Not bad I suppose, and for 99 cents its better then any other places wrap I think. In fact, Wendy's has a HUGE value menu so if your into quick cheap eats, I'd definitely recommend it because I'm sure you can find something."}
{"text":"last time I ordered from this wendys I opened one of the burgers and it had a bug stuck to the cheese. I almost threw up. If you are ever here and are considering eating anything, take it all apart first and inspect it real good, and good luck. I have never and never will eat at Wendy's again. I don't know how this place is still allowed to stay open"}
{"text":"I keep trying to give these people a chance. Every time I come here the person that takes my order is so rude. I tell myself every time that I'm not going to come back but I just love me some Wendy's!!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is by far one of my favorite fast food places and I have been going to them for years. This particular one was a great disappointment. First, the guy taking my order proceeded to argue with me about Baconators being able to have different number of patties to the point I just got a frosty and my girlfriend's food. When we got home, my girlfriend takes off the lid and right smack at the top of her vanilla frosty is a black HAIR. No chance of either of us ever going back to this location."}
{"text":"This place sucks! They are supposed to be open until 2 am, but it's 1 am and no one will acknowledge me in the drive through but i see everyone inside. Don't go here!!"}
{"text":"The service was A1!  Young man at the service window was very quick and helpful and addressed me as sir!  The other young man at the food widow was also polite.  The manager was visible and clearly hands on.  Food was as ordered and tasty!"}
{"text":"Worst place I've visited in University Area. The one time I've been alone and Everytime I've went here with someone, service is exceptionally slow, the employees are very rude and unaccomodating, and the quality is shit.  Whoever owns this franchise obviously cares very little about their business. I hope it gets shut down soon."}
{"text":"I like this location, I go on break and get here about 1:30-not many people are there Staff is nice Even when it is busy, they seem to get people through pretty quickly Good food, always hot when I get it!"}
{"text":"For a fast food place this place is not fast. I've been here a few times and each time it has been painfully slow. Don't get me wrong it's not like there is a long line or anything. Usually there is only 1 person in front of me ordering a simple combo meal yet it takes about 15 to 20 mins before it my turn.  And on the times where no one has been in front of me it still takes about 10 mins for them to even figure out who is working the front.  I'm not sure what all the extra people are doing behind the counter as the cashier is getting my drink and making the fries, then waiting behind the cook to finish off the burger. While 3 other people just stare at the long line now forming behind me and chatting amongst themselves.   And what's the deal with no napkins? Do I know have to order those as well with my meal? Looks like I'll have to find a new burger place for my lunch breaks."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible not only was the food thrown together old nuggets and I got a tiny piece of bacon on my nasty full of mayo patty! No receipt and drinks were covered with soda on the outside! They are right in line with horrible burger king down the street! Yuck"}
{"text":"This was disappointing!  They ran out of baked potatoes and it was barely noon!!  This is not a busy spot and yet they cannot ensure they have all their items on the menu.  The worst part was the server was unsympathetic and told us to come back in an HOUR!  Uh, that takes away the meaning of the words lunch HOUR!"}
{"text":"The speed at which food is delivered after order is impeccable. If this was a sport this Wendy's would lead the league. Very busy spot, yet there is rarely a lineup."}
{"text":"Beyond slow !! Took them 10 minutes to ask what we would like to order , then another 10 to punch it into the system and another 5 minutes once we got the the window.... extremely awful , will not return."}
{"text":"No complaints about this Wendy's except for the fact that they are slow at all times of the day. If you're looking for the \"Fast\" in fast food then avoid this place."}
{"text":"I order an Asiago bancon chicken ranch sandwich.... ended up get a pick of over cooked chicken with some ranch... the lady that took my order was really rude when I told her that I want just the sandwich... she told me Yeah I got it I understand... clearly you didn't because I had no cheese no bancon..."}
{"text":"I worked here in past and know how things should be. The chain is pretty good, but I have had better experiences in their \"ghetto part of town Wendy's\" than this. My review is based on my last 5 visits. I WILL COME AGAIN. I waited in the drive thru for 8 minutes with a \"hold on\" that never returned (and with only one other car). My orders have been wrong every time. My food tasted like $&@? And you missed most of my condiments. Even when I was told \"we are waiting on fries fresh from the fryer\" they were still undercooked. Nothing like cold fries (05.09.16). You WANT $15 an hour? Go f$&? yourselves. I did and several others did a superior job that you for $7.10 an hr."}
{"text":"I wasn't even sure if this location was open, they are missing so many sign panel outside, it looks like an abandoned building!   My son was begging for a frosty, went through the drive thru, ordered him a small chocolate and myself a large chocolate... Sounds simple, right?   We got to the window and I paid the young man, he handed me the small, then him and an older woman we're arguing over which frosty was mine! (The large chocolate in his hand, or the large vanilla in her hand!) He finally handed me the chocolate, and I was sorely disappointed at how it was not filled, posted a photo.   I don't know if it's poor training, or just less for your money at this location. I have never had this problem at any other location in the valley."}
{"text":"Shortly after paying for my food, there was a roach walking on the floor in front of the counter. Where there's one, there are typically many... very comforting. 11:55AM and they had no fries ready for the lunch rush, I'm going to guess that there was some sort of communication issue behind the counter on whoever dropped the ball there. They also have a window company replacing a shattered glass window in 106 degree weather during their lunch rush.... not very comfortable for dine-in customers. Maybe that should have been scheduled in the early morning or late at night... Worst Wendy's experience I've ever had by far."}
{"text":"I have really tried to give this location the benefit of the doubt but NO MORE! This is the 5th time (yes, 5th) I have given the Eastern location a chance. I thought maybe they had an off day or even an off month??  Though the interior is on point, they are lacking in the very place that needs to shine. The food quality is absolutely horrendous. Every time I have ordered any kind of burger the middle is pink and even RED. I didn't know fast food restaurants could cook their burgers at different temperatures (sarcasm)! And whenever I have mentioned it to the manager and staff they seem uninterested and like it's MY FAULT.   Enter today's visit, which was from the pick-up window:   On my order was the 4 piece nuggets, a double stack, a frosty and a strawberry lemonade. First the nuggets were NOT cooked all the way through because they were jelly like and the breading was very light in color, as if they took them out of the oil WAY too fast. The double stack meat tasted old and the bun was very hard and unpleasant. The frosty was rancid and I had to throw it away, not even 2 scoops I took. And the worst part was the strawberry lemonade! It was GROSS, and extremely watered down. I've seen the process of the drink and it's not rocket science. How hard is it to put strawberry puree, ice and lemonade into a drink??!!   NEVER EVER going back! The staff needs to be RE-TRAINED or taught some common sense. Maybe the staff is too young? Or the management is not doing a good job hiring employees. Something needs to be done to fix the problems. Not only is this bad for the company but bad on the consumer who WILL get sick if things aren't fixed.   Next time, don't worry so much about having a fireplace in your establishment and worry more about the food quality and service standards, Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through window last Friday around 10 ish.Was glad to see there was no line. NOW I UNDERSTAND why. As i was rudely asked my order, all I could hear was the drive through clerk giggling and laughing.IT seemed like she was laughing at me.It continued during the whole order placement.I don't know if it was my east coast accent, which I've lost most of anyway, or if it was the teenage girl goofing off while working.Also every item i said I wanted was met by a flat \"huh\" \" what\".When I paid for and received my meal, I realized they forgot to put the fries i ordered and paid for in the bag.So I had to go back to the drive through, at this point there was a line.When I told giggly girl I didn't get my fries.she paused for what seemed like an eternity, then rudely asked what size it was. It was a small.She didn't even apologize or offer an upgrade. SHE COULD CARE LESS. Also I never even  got a receipt the first time. After waiting 15 minutes I finally got my fries.No Apology no upgrade, not even a thank you. The  kicker was, when I picked up the food, there were 3 employees blatantly texting on their phones and chit chatting, standing around doing nothing..How unprofessional. I don't expect much from Wendy's,  except being treated like a human and getting what I ordered. I sent an email to corporate,  but they couldn't be bothered I guess. I know they're just kids, but that's no excuse. I'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE I WAS 16, AND WOULD NEVER DO THAT.I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN."}
{"text":"Okay... Someone has to tell the management and maybe corporate that the drive-thru is ridiculous in both lack of speed and space for my vehicle. If you have a dually or after market rims, stay away!!   I've been to this location twice now and both times I've waited 25+ min with only about 3-4 cars ahead of me and both times were around 9pm.  And it's not like they don't have the man power to pump out food in a decent amount of time because when I went in to complain, I counted over 10 employees!   When this location opened 2 months ago, I was amazed at how busy they were and when passing by, it would seem like they are always busy.  But, no joke, I realized that the reason why they always look busy is because the drive-thru line doesn't move. I was unfortunate enough to end up in the actual lane, and was watching as cars lined up behind me and then speed off after 5 min of waiting without moving... lol...   They really need to correct this ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times & so far I've found it to be one of the friendliest locations. They can miss things once in a while so just be sure to check your order in the drive thru (as I would recommend with any fast food restaurant!)"}
{"text":"This place is horrible I've have 3 bad experiences here. So when you pull up to the check out window you can see the people making your food this dude was coughing all over my sandwiches when I said something the manager had a attitude I told her just give me my money back she said I will remake the food for you which she did and they sent him home so ok I stopped going for a long time went again and there was hair stuck on wet lettuce on my spicy chicken sandwich stopped going for a really long time figure enough time has passed went last week once again I opened my sandwich lone behold hair was on the bun might I add the buns were hard now when I go here we spend a lot of money there is five of us I just called corporate let them know was very clear I want no money or coupons as this is the only Wendy's over here and I will not be visiting it ever again so my advice if you go there look in your sandwich before you eat it because if it's happened to me on several occasions it's happening with others people's food people are eating hair and don't know it I'm giving one star because there is not a option for zero"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good Wendy's. During the day and on weekends, which is when there is an adult on premises, the service is quick, efficient, and accurate--better than most Wendy's I've been to. However, on evening shift the staff tends to be goofing off with each other and is less reliable in customer service. The food is standard Wendy's fare, which is to say very good overall for fast food, and perhaps a notch above other fast food brands. Just off I-271 and Rt 82. Much better than the nearby McDonald's. They also haven't switched to crappy plastic booths yet like many \"updated\" fast food places, in December there's a tree, and there is carpet on the floor--nice."}
{"text":"I enjoy Wendy's very much and usually don't mind ordering at this location. Today I went through the drive thru at about 12:10 a.m. And was told \"Sorry you missed us, please come back tomorrow at 10 a.m.\" That's why I am only giving this location a 3 star for stating they close at 1a.m. but not actually being open that long."}
{"text":"I've always loved Wendy's food. It's been awhile since my last visit due to where I lived the last several years. This location is clean but the staff seems new & inexperienced. I appreciate they have Pibb in their soda fountain. At 99 cents, it was definitely better than the $2.50 Wild Berry Lemonade made from their regular lemonade but the berry syrup was not mixed together. The mixed berry Frosty Shake was awesome.  Overall, great menu/food choices you've always expected from Dave."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's ever. Prime location but everyone that works the drive thru either is having a bad day or hates there job.  This is the second time that they forgot something food wise that I paid for. Today was my Cesar salad and sauces and straws .  I was too busy to check the bag which I shouldn't have to anyways. The other time they forgot my large order of chicken nuggets. And when I do actually check they make me feel bad or stupid if I have to ask for straws or sauces that they forgot to put in the bag. This place should hire all new people or just close. It's just awful. Should be the best cause of all the traffic coming in and out.  Employees are so rude and mean.Go to culvers across the street. Trust me!!!!!"}
{"text":"Here is the complaint I just sent to Wendy's Corporate: I got to this location. There was a Spanish speaking couple in line ahead of me and no one else on line. There were at least 4 employees in the location. Two of them were speaking Spanish to the couple on line. One looked like he might be the manager, but I'm not sure. I stood there for almost 10 minutes and no one so much as said hello, let alone took my order. I left and I am furious. Has Wendy's turned into a location that caters to Spanish speakers and ignores others? NOT EVEN AN \"I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.\" Two workers - one of which also looked like he might have been a manager - were wandering in the back and did make eye contact with me, but ignored me. The two up front - both males - treated me like I wasn't even there. They did make eye contact and then ignored me. I assume this is not the sort of service Wendy's would like to be known for. What a joke.  And, on the way out of the parking lot, I had to strain to look over the bushes that are blocking the view of on-coming traffic - and I was driving a truck. The over grown landscape at that location is dangerous and it's an accident waiting to happen.  You might want to figure out what's going on here. The service is bad and the landscaping is dangerous. I left without making a purchase today and probably will not return to that location. I will take the time later to post this information to some of the various local review sites. What happened today is unacceptable. Hopefully you have a translator who can help you with this since apparently Wendy's no longer caters to English speakers."}
{"text":"Love their chocolate frosties. Other places have imitations but Wendy's are the real deal. I love to dip the salty fries in there for dessert! Ive never had a bad experience. This location is clean and provides quick service. Theyve never screwed up an order. I come here all the time. A frosty is the best dessert!"}
{"text":"It's a great Wendy's.  It's fast food done as good as it gets.  Service is outstanding, foof is what it is.  The contrast with that worthless McD's down the block could not be greater!"}
{"text":"Waited in a long line at drive through for chicken nuggets and a burger only to get to the window to be told they are out of ranch to top it off my Jr bacon cheeseburger patty was pink. Worst Wendy's I've been to"}
{"text":"Everyone here is nice and polite.They really care about costumers. They go way beyond the fast food expectations. They even went table to table offering mints. I even went there with my schools choir and they served all of us well and we even got to sing, so if you want to bring a group you should!"}
{"text":"JUST venting on the lifelong favor of the FROSTY... why are the frostys so inconsistent.   LOVE the heavy cold textured frosty... can be anywhere from runny and creamy and still cold to the ultra thick spoon worthy ones.....   fast food is fast food and I wont yelp on it much if at all since we allll know what to expect but like I said just venting"}
{"text":"I ordered apple pecan chicken salad, fries and iced tea. This does not happens once but on other wendys store too. The salad has mold on cheese! All their salads are pre packed so I guess they serve it without expiration date. I would never eat their salad again. I would give them no star at all. Don't eat the salad until you look at it closely or worst tasted it."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is very nice  and new. We usually like this place but this occasion we found a bone in our chicken sandwich. We gave it to the man cleaning the lobby. He took it to his supervisor/ manager and know one approached us with an apology or questions. This was in bad taste and we will not be back"}
{"text":"The main reason I like Wendy's is their burgers. The meat taste like actual hamburgers. Like if I was to make it myself hamburgers. I'm talking about ground beef!!! Chili is good too. Value menu has decent items as well. Gave it 4 stars cause I don't go inside and I usually get the same thing. A double w/cheese and healthy option side salad combo."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience several weeks ago where I had to pull up and wait for my food. The wait was over 10 minutes and after all of that my order of bacon was not in the bag. I had to go in and wait in line to get the item. I'm all for second chances so today I went to Wendy's and once again I was asked to pull up to the palm tree. I timed it and once again I waited over 10 minutes for my food. It was a breakfast meal and not even close to the end of the serving time.They came out with the food and this time I checked and no bacon. She went in and did bring it out to me this time, however ALL of the food was ice cold. I was very clear that I will not give them a another chance and save others from the trouble."}
{"text":"Ordered a crispy chicken sandwich and burger combos. Chicken was smothered in mayonnaise,  grilled, and not fully cooked. Waited 5 min for fries as they were out.  One set was hot the other completely cold. Needless to say we will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Yeah, I have to agree, this place is consistently bad. Because I live so close to this location, I've gone here a few times, usually in the late evening, but I vow no more! The drive-thru is run by a bunch of rapping-gangsta teenagers who curse freely when they \"mistakenly\" leave their microphone on, come-on to you sexually when you drive up to pay, and serve you food that has been sitting under the heat lamp for too long. I've been served a salad with barely any toppings that are supposed to come with the salad, a burger that was room-temperature at best, and I always feel like I need a shower after conversing with the \"slick-talkin' \" drive-thru boy."}
{"text":"Never coming back. Spineless staff that refuse to have the bum's who harass everyone for cash and food removed. I don't need to be physically threatened by hobo's when I'm on my way in or out. You have a responsibility to your customers, yourselves, and the public to do your part in removing thise loitering losers from your business."}
{"text":"This place tops my chart as the worst customer service I have ever received in my entire life. Having just been released from the hospital and given the okay to eat whatever I wanted, I fast tracked it to the nearest fast food joint I could find to grab a quick meal.   I was initially greeted with, \"What do you want?\" I brushed this aside despite it being overly rude and attempted to order food for my family. I say \"attempted\" because, for the first time in my life, I didn't make it past the drive-thru speaker.   While ordering, the lady taking my order began speaking with another employee about prices. About 15 seconds of this went on before she returned to speaking with me.   Having just waited for her to have a conversation that could've waited the 15 seconds it would have taken me to place my order, she begins speaking to me in a rushed manner. \"Do you want your combo 'this style, this style, or this style'? Size? What to drink?\" Not only was this the icing on the cake for me, but I looked at my fiance to make sure that I wasn't in the wrong. Her look was also that of disbelief. I calmly told the lady that she was being \"f***ing rude\" and left for what turned out to be a Burger King down the road. Despite the BK's slower than usual service, it was 10x better than what I received at this place.   All-in-all: This place marks the first time that I was unable to make it past the ordering phase at any fast food location. Considering the bad service I have received elsewhere, this place makes its way to the top of the list for worst overall. I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is located between work and where I go after work, haha, and its not that bad, sometimes.......  I have been to this location multiple time, thus the dukedom but unfortunately its more about location and accessability than service (and isn't it true that's the case with most everything these days \"/) but I digress, the wait times are longer than average when you dine in or even if you go through the drive thru, and that makes me sad.  The only reason this place is getting two stars is the fact that I know that I will probably be back there, another thing that makes me sad.  There is hope though, every once in a while I get pretty good service so the silver lining is there but hopefully that shines through more often than not!  We will see as I said before I will be back and hopefully they suprise me in a good way!"}
{"text":"Generally, I'm not one to eat at fast food restaurants unless on a road trip, but when a late meeting left me looking for dinner at 9:00pm (when other nearby restaurants that I like were already closed), I decided on Wendy's as a sort of...last resort.   So to the drive-thru I went! I always appreciate when a drive-thru speaker is clear and easy to understand, so that was Wendy's first positive (in addition to no line). The woman working sounded really friendly and polite, another good thing. I placed my order for a 4 for $4 meal (Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger, Chicken Nuggets, Fries, and a Sprite) and it was ready very quickly. That's really quite a good deal for less than five dollars! All of the items even looked nice and tasted good. Thus, I was fed and satisfied.  This is a good Wendy's. I would definitely consider stopping by here again, when in need, ahead of any other similar fast food establishment."}
{"text":"Do you like having your order messed up? If you do, then this is the Wendy's that you should visit! I made a Yelp account just so I could tell everyone how HORRIBLE this Wendy's is. I've been to this Wendy's drive through at least 6 times, and they have messed up my order literally EVERY TIME. Most times they just don't honor whatever substitutions I request (which, admittedly, isn't unheard of in the typical fast food experience). One time, they mixed up my order with the person behind me and gave me his food. You'd think they'd have a pretty decent system for queuing up orders, right? Guess not.   Tonight, I couldn't just blame it on how busy they because there was nobody in front of me at 9PM. I ordered the Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger. I pulled up to the front and they took my card and, in what couldn't have been more than 60 seconds, gave me back my card and my receipt and a bag of food. I drove about 5 feet and then pressed my brake. Something felt off. I had been burned by this Wendy's before and I had to stop my car to make sure that everything I ordered was in the bag. I spotted my fries and a wrapped burger. I thought that was good enough.  But I was wrong.  I arrived home and excitedly unwrapped a single cheeseburger with bacon slapped on. Not a Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger with honey-mustard sauce, cheddar cheese and that warm pretzel bun. What I was given had all of the things I HATE. Mayo, american cheese, crappy buns. Gross. I'd rather visit the one at McCarron International Airport and pay double the price and actually get what I ordered."}
{"text":"Gotta be honest here. Food is okay, not my first choice where I want to eat but my patient loves it so we come here pretty much every weekend.... So well every weekend we come here something always happens... This time, today, we come to eat here after a movie. And first we stay up from for about 10 minutes before someone comes out to the front to get our order. Every one is at the back and while they come out, they have their mouths full of food, that is including the cashiers, the people working the friers, and doing stocking in the back and also the one working the drive through. Everyone comes out from the managers office. Anyways, the manager gets our order as well as the other people behind me. After everyone gets their food. Five minutes later, everyone disappears back into the managers office and then some more people come in to order and they wait about another 10 minutes before everyone piles out of the office again with their mouths full. Well 15 minutes later i go back up to the front to get a bag to take my patients food home. Well it takes another 10 minutes and again everyone comes out with their mouth full from the managers office, including the manager. So that's why I give this Wendy's just two stars."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Wendy's on many occasions, but have to say that this is one that we will not be returning to. The employees were nice, but service was so slow.  We waited for several minutes for our order, and we weren't the only ones. While we were in line, someone came to make a purchase and was turned away because they didn't have change. Not a way to encourage a repeat customer.  When we did get our food, the fries were already cold - but not worth it to wait in line again to try to get hot ones."}
{"text":"Wendy's always delivers at a high level.  Their value menu is a little over priced but everything else is up to snuff.  Great for lunch on the go."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would. Ive lived in this same neighborhood all my life. Have eaten at this Wendys time and time again. But in the last few years it has gone to complete crap. They hire a bunch of inexperienced people who would rather talk smack to eachother then listen to what the people are saying in the drive thru. I went through the drive thru on Sept 18 after watching the Wendys nugget commercial with the spicy siracha sauce. While talking to the person in the drive thru we kept hearing the employees on the talking to eachother about where they are going to go for the weekend. all why we are trying to order our food. when we got to the window to pay, the employees still talking we come to find out that half our order was missing. i said ill go inside to fix it. yea that was a joke too. In front of me were 2 other customers that had their order screwed up. The manager that was on duty that night had no problem joining in the employees banter and ignoring the customers in the lobby. One of the ladies removed everything they had wrong with her hamburger and gave it back to the employees. So much for customer satisfaction right. By the time i got up to order the rest of my order that was left off i got an ow sorry $3.77 please. not a hey can we take care of this for you, nothing.... By the time I got home after spending a whopping $29 on food, the hamburgers that we had ordered were soggy and cold. The chicken nuggets that I so wanted were partially frozen. The soda was all carbonation and no flavor. Basically I put $29 of food in the trash. To top things off my oldest son got sick from what he did eat and ended up staying home from school the next day. I emailed Wendys that night and got a response the next morning, Then another manager called me back. She was more worried about offering me free food and getting me to come back and spend money in her store then anything. I said why would i want free food when it made my son sick and ya all cant cook anyway. Partially frozen food is not my idea of fast food. After pleaing with me and failing on retaining me as a customer she said she was emailing her GM who would contact me and send me \"something\" she asked for my address and that was it. She sounded more annoyed then me by the end of the call. This all took place on Sept 20th. Here it is Oct 7th and still nothing from some make believe GM who would send me \"something\". What id like is my $29 back but with this store I dont see if happening.  If you are hungry trust me there are plenty more places to eat then here. Avoid this shithole at all costs. My 6 year old can cook and be more polite then these people."}
{"text":"Quick. Good. Super for a nice lunch. I really liked the coke/soda machine, with 20 zillion flavors."}
{"text":"I come here often because I live very close. I would say about 90% of the time they mess up the order, no matter what it is. I could order a cheeseburger with just mayo and get a hamburger with ketchup, tomato, lettuce, onion. (Yes, this has happened to me). One time I ordered a burger and (no lie) it was not fully cooked. The middle was bright pink. I am pregnant and had I but noticed, me and my baby could have been very sick. This place needs to get it together. My father in law has once gotten food poisoning from this location and has not been back since. I love Wendy's, it's one of my favorite fast food burger places. But I will not be going back. They less up everything and when you call to tell them, they act annoyed with you and like you are the issue. There's a reason this place has such low ratings. Maybe cooperate could step in and figure out the issues."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! No one expects fast food to be gourmet, but this experience would make corporate cry! Ordered food for 2 adults (full meals) and for one child and was charged for 2 more adult meals, I asked why the amount was so high and the employee said nothing to me, looked the other way and yelled for a manager. Still feeling over charged but not wanting to agitate the situation any further we left with 1 less drink then we ordered, cold food and a soda water instead of sprite because no one changed the syrup. Never again."}
{"text":"We've been to the Surprise location more than a few times now. Burgers and fries are good, no complaints there, but their Frosty...it's NOT! When we eat their Frosty, the consistency is like a foamy milkshake; no use for a spoon. We've eaten a Frosty at the Goodyear and Phoenix location and their Frosty IS LIKE A FROSTY -- very thick-like soft serve ice cream. I've called and complained once and the manager was nice enough to offer me a complimentary meal on my next visit for the inconvenience. Every time I visit I always hope their Frosty is up to par and every time I set myself up for disappointment :(. Please Surprise Wendy's, get in contact with the other local Wendy's to see what makes their Frosty different from yours."}
{"text":"Tried it again. Not good. I ask for a chicken sandwich with everything plus cheese. The lettuce was wilted and no tomatoes. When I ask for tomatoes she tried to tell me tomatoes was on the sandwich. After looking at the sandwich twice. She gave me two tomatoes wrap in paper. The tomatoes look really bad. My friend order a junior cheese burger deluxe cooked. It was not done... I remember when Wendy's was  the best!!  The food was fresh. Now it's just like Burger King nasty..."}
{"text":"Not going here anymore because the guy with the beard is the second drive thru person to creep me out."}
{"text":"I was VERY disappointed with my experience that I had with this particular Wendy's. I visited this location at 12:00am on Sunday July 31st after coming from a music festival. I chose to go to Wendy's because I wanted something new for a late night snack as oppose to going to MacDonald's or Tim Hortons plus this location was very close from home.  Why did this particular Wendy's (store #00006871) receive 1/5 stars is because of the service of the staff and quality of the food. The drive thru wasn't busy it was completely empty and the outside of the store was clean but that still won't change my star rating to a 2. I originally wanted a Dave's Triple medium combo and I was surprise that I had paid $8.73 when it said it was $10 something, I thought I had gotten a deal but boy was I wrong. After receiving my order I had to double check and from my surprise I received a single instead. I was about to go inside to complaint but it was locked so I went through the drive thru again. I explained to the Middle Eastern lady (her name was either Mandeep or Reda, not too sure since I have two names on my receipt) that my order was wrong and that I wanted a triple instead of the single. Instead of apologizing she was like \"what was your order? Was it 3410 with root beer?\" In a harsh tone and I was like yeah. She reprinted the receipt and in her accent she was like \"here this is what you order. There is no Dave Triple it says Dave Single\" I looked at it and wow was I surprise. I told the cashier that I wanted a Dave's Triple combo and I had to triple check to make sure but instead I got a single combo. I told the Middle Eastern lady in the window that I'll exchange the burger I got and pay for the difference which was a couple of cents and she gave me attitude and said \"no! What you order is what you order. If you want the triple burger you will have to pay\" I am completely shocked. Instead of fixing a mistake you want me to pay for the burger in full price? I wasn't impress with her attitude but good thing the supervisor came and I explained to him what happen, he apologized and said he will fix the mistake at no cost.   I am very disappointed with my experience and the girl that was refusing my request/concern. Instead of trying to resolve the issue she had the nerve to argue with me and give me attitude. One thing I know is that the customer is always a priority and that the customer is always right, it's standard restaurant/hospitality policy. I would strongly recommend corrective feedback to the employee and I will bring this up to the restaurant manager."}
{"text":"don't really mind waiting lines, or employees, however, took a bite out of the burger and found a hard little crunchy plastic straw like thing in the cheeseburger. I killed that cheeseburger still though cuz i was pretty hungry lmao. I ordered 2 Jr. cheeseburgers, 6 nuggets, fries and without a drink. Try eating a burger without a drink, it's hard, try swallowing a plastic thing (which I'm glad I didn't) without a drink. I'm just glad I lived to see another day and chewed my food. Lol I bit into the plastic thing and it bent a little. It didn't break. Just a mistake that could of happened anywhere."}
{"text":"Late night grumblies..... one of the few remaining bastions of non-battered overly seasoned French fries! must they all be battered dipped? any who, if u time it right, u leave with a hot, juicy burger on a soft bun, evenly cut hot fries and an airy frosty with quick speed service."}
{"text":"Worst manager ever. The guy with the blonde hair and glasses. If he's working don't go. He'll screw up your order and ignore you when you come in. Don't go here"}
{"text":"I come here for the wild berry tea and chicken salad.  Other than that, I can not comment on the other food on there menu.  They always seem polite and helpful when I am there."}
{"text":"Worst wendys ever. Had to deal with racist remarks from the lady after her refusing to serve me because she didn't want to make specific food not already made. Will never ever return to this location. Disgusting a high grossing company like wendys would hire such terrible ppl."}
{"text":"My thought: \"someone rescue me from the rude, crazy behemoth lady!!!\"  I guess I should start from the beginning. I am in a time crunch and starving, and remembered that Wendy's is usually pretty solid when it comes to burgers. I decide to go to the drive thru.  Lady: \"HEEEELOOOO!!!\" Me: :\"umm..hi, I need just a minute\" Lady: (heavy breathing and a grunt) \"fine\"  I'm pondering and decide on the Swiss Jr Bacon and 5pc Chicken nuggets and order.  Me: \"Ma'am?\" Lady: \"YES\" Me: \"I would like the chicken nuggets and the Jr bacon swiss\" Lady: \"Next window\"  Wow...I wonder what this broad looks like. My guess was something mean and ape-looking. I prepare to have the food thrown in my lap and arrive at the window. The lady just sticks her hand out of the window. I guess she want my debit card. I hand it to her. Nothing. She says nothing! Hands me the food. I ask if she had included Ranch (for my chicken nuggets). \"No, I don't think so\". Well CAN I EFFING HAVE SOME RANCH...Puhlease!!!?!  After all that, I wanted to take my chicken nuggets and burger and throw them in her face. It may have made her look better. Grrr..."}
{"text":"Was forced to eat here as it was the only restaurant nearby to Firestone where work was being done on my car. The first thing I noticed was how slow the line was moving compared to other Wendy's that I have been to in the past. The next complaint I have is the smell of the restaurant. I sat down in a table that dines two next to the window facing firestone so I could see when my car was done being worked on. Once I was seated I immediately noticed this rancid smell that smelled quite like a overly used rag that was mostly used to clean the table I ate from. My final complaint and the reason that I felt the need to leave this review was the dispensers for ketchup were out so I went up to where you order and asked nicely if they'd change them. The cashier said she didn't know how. This is when she asked her manager if he could do it and he said he would get to it in a minute. Satisfied, I went back to my seat and began eating my spicy chicken sandwich while leaving my fries off to the side while i waited for the ketchup dispensers to be refilled. Next thing I know I finish my entire meal without them refilling the ketchup. After I finished I also wrote this lengthy review and they still have yet to refill the damn ketchup. Extremely dissatisfied and increased hatred for fast food chain restaurants"}
{"text":"They totally screwed up my order, wrong drink, no fries, and I was charged for it all."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't review a Wendy's because I think pretty much everyone has been at one time or another.  The one at Sky Harbor is quick as the come and the quality is fine.  I grab a burger for the plane if it's going to be a long flight."}
{"text":"Pretty disgusted last time in. Flies were everywhere, no exaggeration that about everyone in the place including employees were swatting flies away from them. God only knows if any ended up in the food. I even said \"got a bit of a fly problem, huh??\" To which I got a shrug and a laugh. I won't be back for some time if at all. Travel the extra couple miles somewhere else if you really need fast food."}
{"text":"I always go to Wendy's when I think to myself, \"How do I fulfill my fast food cravings, get a filling meal, and spend less than $10\". This store itself is a very stylish, and nice looking place to eat. There are lots of tables, and a nice circular one that allows for a group of 3-8 people. I currently attend Earl Haig Secondary School, so a lot of friends and people I know come here for lunch, and afterschool. The food here is very junk like, but it tastes good, and is visually appealing. (If you go to Wendy's looking for great tasting fries and burgers, you found the right place.)   Also, If you plan on going with a large group of people (more than 5 people), and you make noise, be ready to get kicked out. Numerous times, a group of 10 friends and I were kicked out for being too noisy and taking up the circular table without enough of us buying food. But on the other hand, why would a manager want a bunch of teens 'loitering' in his store and the girls taking selfies of everything :P"}
{"text":"Got a double. That must mean I want a burger with a slice of yellow tomato, a pickle and a ton of mayonnaise. No onion or lettuce."}
{"text":"Slowest Wendies EVER.  Seriously, we spent 15 minutes in line too order with 3 people ahead of us.   It's 7:30 on a Sunday night, it's not that busy."}
{"text":"Just spent ten minutes of a 30 min break trying to order with only two cars in front of me. Beyond angry right now.  Pulled away with nothing"}
{"text":"AWFUL experience today! I went through the drive through around 5pm today and to my surprise there weren't many people in line. The line was 3 deep, 4 with my car, and yet I was stuck in line for over 20 miinutes! I finally gave the lady my order. \"The Ultimate Chicken Grill PLAIN, just the sandwich please\". As I waited in line to reach the window to pay for my order the car immediately infront of me jumps out of line and speeds off! Poor guy was so frustrated about his wait that he drove away leaving his food behind.   I am now at the only window that is in use and get ready to pay. She asks me what I ordered. Again I said \"The Ultimate Chicken Grill PLAIN\". She looks in the bag, asks me for my money, hands me my change and I drive away thinking about the yummy sandwich that is in that white bag.   I make it back to the office and when I open up my bag it is not PLAIN like I asked for and clarified at the window! My sandwich was dripping with sauce and had EVERYTHING on it! I'm on a new diet and cant have all of the nastiness that was all over that poor chicken sandwich! I was now a little angry and hopped back into my car to have them correct their mistake.  When I got there I explained to the young lady what the problem was and she was very nice. She turned out to be the only pleasant person during my whole experience. She asked the staff to fix the problem and as they were fixing it I could here them arguing with eachother about whose fault it was. Personally I dont care who messed up!!! The fact is that I am starving, upset, and now in a hurry, but all I hear is what sounds like a teenage he said you said going on.   I'm very disappointed in this Wendy's because I have never had a problem with them. The only reason they received two stars was because they DID fix the problem and my new sandwich was piping hot. Other than the freshness of my sandwich I was extremely dissatisfied."}
{"text":"orders are usually right, food is good, better than the other surprise options like mcdonalds and jack in the box."}
{"text":"This place went through a complete transformation! I have been coming to this Wendy's for 7 years and I couldn't believe my eyes when I walked in today. Saying they  remodeled is an understatement. The layout is completely different. The ordering process is much easier since the person taking the order is no longer the one fulfilling the order. Much faster and the food is good too!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this Wendy's! The interior was unlike any Wendy's I've been to. It is much more upscale and has a much more cafe like feel to it. My order was taken by what appeared to be the manager. She was very friendly and she involved the other staff in my order. They were all very friendly and prompt. I tried the Ranch Flatbread sandwich and a Caesar salad. The sandwich was a bit messy to way but tasted very good. I'm not in this part of town very often but I definitely recommend this location."}
{"text":"Well i have been waiting to re- review this location, but again up until Friday Dec 2/11 there are still signs up by the till stating that the toasters are still about to be installed and it will be soon :( i hope it happens this year :(:( then i can give another review ."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I give this place 2 stars is because I live so close and it's the only fast food close by me. Other than that, they are awful. From a slow drive thru to rude staff. And I'm not fully sure if the darker skinned foreign guy is the owner, but he does not have good customer service. I will be glad when this place is gone from there!"}
{"text":"Wendy's has been my fav fast food restaurant since I was a kid.  This is the closest one to my home and I will pass by 3 McDonald's and a Jack-in-the-box to get there.  Each time I have eaten there has been a real disappointment. I don't eat fast food often but I know what Wendy's should taste like. The overall quality seems to really be suffering at this location. The fries and the meat are consistently overcooked and taste as if they've been sitting for long stints.  I usually go after work around 6pm. Each time I ask them to rectify the issues I experienced the last time. Each time it comes out just like the previous visit.  I am not a picky eater but I do expect quality and consistency when I pay a restaurant for food and have been a loyal customer for years.  I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"COCKROACHS!!!!! COMPLETELY TRAUMATIZED BY THIS WENDYS. I will never eat here again and neither should you.   Went into Wendy's last night to grab a quick meal before I headed across the way to Galaxy Theaters. As I walked through the doors the first thing I said was it smelled like a barn. The smells hit you as soon as you walked in. The smell wasn't the sewage it smelled like hay from a barn.   Two other girls walked in behind us that said the same exact thing.   As I am talking to the cashier I see something crawling on the wall to the left of the register. All I could say was \"Uhmm you have a cockroach crawling on your wall.\"   THE THING WAS THE SIZE OF A GROWN MANS THUMB. It wasn't your typical cockroach you see on the ground in Vegas it looked like he's been living there for awhile. Looked a lot like a hissing cockroach. You could see those pointy things on its legs it was so big. http://www.antbusters.com/images/American_Roach_-_4.jpg  Without hesitation we ran out of the building and so did the girls behind us. What made me upset was that the cashier just walked away from the counter like that happens often. Never again will I eat at another Wendys"}
{"text":"My family used to go to Wendy's fairly regularly and occasionally we would get soggy fries or a stale burger (tasted like it had been sitting around for a while and was reheated). If you're a regular fast food person you know these things happen and you expect the restaurant to bounce back and make it up on the next order.  Well for this particular Wendy's location they stopped giving us the occasional bad items and started giving them to us every time on every item. The fries were soggy all the time and every burger we got tasted old. This happened on three consecutive trips so we no longer go to this Wendy's."}
{"text":"This place sucks when it comes to their green tea!!  You might as well drink sugar water!!  It's so gross and they charge an arm and leg for it!!  I have had their green tea at least 5 times hoping it would change but no.  I am so done with this place!  Either make better green tea or get rid of the manager who obviously isn't serving the customer!  A disappointing customer."}
{"text":"Not only can't they get the order correct, they can't put everything in the bag that I paid for. I'm never comming back you brainless morons. FYA."}
{"text":"They may have renovated the building but the service was awful, I waited at the front counter to order for 8minutes without even a \"hello\" or a \"we will be with you in a minute\".  I ended up leaving and going to Burger King."}
{"text":"First time in awhile the miss and i had Wendy's.  Both of us ordered the chicken sandwich  she had the smoked Gouda on brioche I had the spicy chicken on a pretzel bun.  Both were were served cold and both were tasteless. No \"spice\" flavour to mine. The miss'a was bland tasting.  The lettuce on both was wilted and limp.   Both ketchup dispensers were empty. Good thing this Wendy's is close to the U of C and cater to the students because as a mature adult we will not come back"}
{"text":"Apparently the people who work in this particular Wendy's are all morons.  For the second time in a row my order is messed up. I ordered a total of three burgers.. did I get them? No.. I got a single baconator.. instead of the double patty that it comes with. Mind you they also charged me extra for the cheese and the bacon.. over the price of the burger.. Then of the two other burgers, I received only one of them, but I sure paid for both, including be charged extra for the cheese that already comes on them. This is ridiculous.. tomorrow I will head in and speak with the manager.. but since I've just gotten off a 16 freakin hour shift I'm just to tired and frustrated to go and not say something I shouldn't about the lack of iq points the employees seem to share.."}
{"text":"Once again I have to give mass props to an employee here named \"D\".  I used the drive thru today, and as always a friendly voice took my \"special\"order. And got it right.. a major plus..  But I was running late for work and didn't have the time to stop and get coffee creamer. I asked \"D\" if they had any. She and another lady came to my rescue and got me some in a little to go cup since they don't carry the little creamers.  They could have just said \"no\" and I'd have been disappointed but accepting. But no, they went out of their way to make me happy.  This crew is the best there is.. always friendly and on the ball.. I Sincerely hope the management here knows how lucky they are to have such great employees working for them.  Btw I come to this location at least three times a week. Keep up the great work!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location maybe 10 times in the past few years and every time I go through the drive through the order is wrong. No fries, no salad dressing with salad, no fork, and the last straw was at the bottom of my chili bowl it was about a 6in piece of paper. Avoid!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!, I've tried giving this numerous trips since it's close to me & by far the slowest Wendy's, its always a 10-15 min wait just for them to get your order. Drive elsewhere"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is not up to \"Wendy's\" standards.  Our chili was watery & contained very little meat or beans. Sipping over 1/2 of the cup of broth to reach any meaty goodness is just not what Wendy's chili  is famous for.  The usual tasty thick soup base was thin & lacked its usual goodness.  So disappointed - Wendy's are usually so reliable."}
{"text":"This place is just terrible, I don't write many reviews but this is sad, I live in McDowell mountain ranch and this is the closest wendys location to me, and yet I would rather drive 20 minutes out of my way because of the lack of effort by this location. For years I have been ignorant and foolish enough to come here time and again and NEVER is this food hot or fresh, soft cold fries, burgers that need to be heated up, cold chicken that seems someone microwaved it for a 20 second period.... people I urge you not for my anger but your stomach don't eat here, fast food is bad enough for us but this is like suicide, and in North scottsdale to boot. No chance of this going right for you just go to any of the other places right here, Burger king or mcdonalds, chic fil et, taco bell, jack in the box, Boston market, pei wei, NYPD pizza, but for your own sake NOT this wendys."}
{"text":"Very Incompetent Manager, And Staff. Sad to see when there is a line around the building, with the manager laughing about the poor service."}
{"text":"This location is tucked away but on my drive home so i have stopped there several times. Everytime that wasnt around lunch time, the food was not fresh - old fries and warmed burgers.  I recommend the location at 23rd ave and deer valley, close but much more consistent quality."}
{"text":"We have been here about three times in the last 6 weeks or so and so far everything has been great. Great service and fast service. Don't believe all the bad reviews you're seeing here. Go there and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I HATE complaining.  I definitely don't like writing a bad review.  I Think that Yelp should be for people wanting to find GOOD places to go, and to praise locations and employees.  But it is also for seeing which locations should be avoided if possible.  This is one of those reviews.  I usually like to make my own food at home, but occasionally I like to have my husband just grab us take out once in a while.  I love Wendy's chili, chicken sandwich, and baked potato for a quick, easy, late-night bite.  The one star is not for Wendy's.  It is for this location.  Specifically later at night.    We have given this location several chances, and each time we are disappointed.  The take-out line takes forever.  The people are hard to deal with and rude sometimes.  The food has come out cold, even when they claim it will take an extra five minutes to make that item.  They run out of potatoes quite often.  Twice, when I got my chili, it was a cup of watery beans with (large) chunks of hamburger patty!!!!  I couldn't eat it.  (The dog was quite pleased.)  I used to ask for cheese in my chili (which they charge for, which I understand), but they only put in a small pinch.  Not really worth it.  Maybe it is the wine talking, but I really think that people should know that this take out line should be avoided late at night.  Even though Wendy's sounds delicious sometimes, it might be worth it to travel a little further to the next location.  That is what we will be doing from now on.  Wendy's, I do enjoy your food in a pinch, but this location needs some attention.  Not just for me (I know I am just an old fogie, and should be asleep late at night, so this shouldn't affect me) but for everyone who needs Wendy's late at night."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting - filthy . I literally threw out a chicken sandwich because it was cooked improperly. I live mile away so stop sometimes to see if maybe a new owner or improvement have been made but it's been a filthy greasy cesspool for years now. Too bad it's a great franchise in other markets ."}
{"text":"im a regular at wendy's but at this location the employees are EXTREMELY rude and sometimes mess up my order. i order a spicy chicken burger and what i receive is dried up lettuce no mayo and 4 ! tomatoes like what is that even and when you complain they are even more rude and say \"thats how a spicy chicken burger is\" when clearly it is not. AVOID THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"This review is for the Wendy's inside MCCarran Airport in Las Vegas. For some strange reason, this Wendy's location was freaking amazing when we were there. I'm pretty certain it's the best Wendy's I've ever had. I had a Pretzel Bacon Burger, and my wife had some sort of breakfast flatbread sandwich. Everything tasted remarkably fresh, and the bacon was perfectly crispy. This was a very surprising experience.   Honestly, the food quality was more like a sit-down restaurant than a fast food joint.  Generally, I do like Wendy's well enough. But this was far beyond other experiences I've had with the chain, so much so that I felt compelled to give them an Internet thumbs-up. I don't know if this location is always this good, but wow...unexpectedly exceptional, especially for an airport restaurant.  I did notice there are a few reviews on this airport Wendy's from 2011 that are fairly poor.  I wonder if management is different there now?  I'm not sure what's changed, but the place was pure greatness when we were there (August 2013)."}
{"text":"I have been to this Wendy's twice in the past month and both times were extremely disappointing. The first time I went through the drive through and ordered a chicken Caesar salad with grilled chicken and ranch dressing. Not only was the girl at the drive through window extremely rude, you could clearly tell she wasn't happy and she looked like she wanted to kill herself. So already irritated with the poor customer service I finally got my salad and headed home. I guess it was my fault for not checking it before I left the drive through. I got home to find Caesar dressing and crispy chicken and only a half size salad when I ordered and paid for a full size! I called and the manager. She was very nice and remade my order for lunch the following day correctly with no charge. Yesterday my sisters and I decided to swing by Wendy's for dinner. We each ordered a spicy chicken sandwich combo as it comes and add pickles and cheese and no ice in the drinks. Pretty easy, all of us had the same order. One of the sandwiches was plain one sandwich and everything plus ketchup, and the third was actually made correctly but with only 2 pickles! All three drinks had a lot of ice. And the fries were so old I wouldn't even feed them to the dog! Again the Custer service was horrible. The young boy at the register this time had no idea how to work the computer it took over twenty minutes just for the three of us to place out order! It is unfortunate but I will definitely not be returning to this Wendy's and I think its safe to say that neither of my sisters will return either!"}
{"text":"Good location & fast. BUT had sore stomach and diarrhea after having their lemonade.  And some staff keeps coughing very loud in the back while we were sitting outside.  Oh well...not going back again i guess."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, employees super nice, dining area very clean (despite being the outdated decor). I got the full-size Spicy Chicken Caesar salad and asked for the chicken to be chopped very small to which they happily obliged. Lettuce was crisp and fresh. Great experience...waiting for them to upgrade to the new Wendy's decor."}
{"text":"I love to go to this Wendy's , the staff are quick, efficient and always friendly. They've never gotten my order wrong!  My main pet peeve with any fast food restaurant is ordering a burger and getting wilting warm or half rotting lettuce, not here its always fresh and crisp. I've eaten in and it's always been clean, staff always willing to help. Drive through is the best! Never have to wait."}
{"text":"Don't like fast food, but sometimes you just have to settle.   They added lettuce when I said not too....  spicy chicken wrap tastes ok for fast food"}
{"text":"Going through this Wendy's Drive-thru could stand to be improved on many different levels!  First, person taking orders did not know what was on their menu!  I ordered a fish sandwich, which is currently listed with a nice big juicy picture.  Took awhile for him to find it, & then it turned out that it wasn't being offered right now.  Then why is it on their location's website??  Ok, so I ordered 3 jr bacon cheeseburgers & an Asiago Bacon Chicken (grilled, not fried) sandwich, a root beer & a small Frosty.   When I got home, my order consisted of 3 cheeseburgers with ketchup & pickles, a Dr Pepper, a completely melted-to-no-taste chicken sandwich...stramed, not grillrd?  There was no cheese or dressing on it...unless they completely melted away so that it was a VERY LIMP small piece of lettuce, no cheese, or dressing.  Tasteless!  How horrified I was.  The 3 little hamburgers weren't what I ordered, nor the drink & the lrg chicken tasted over-steamed, but NOT grilled.    Won't be going there again.  What happened, Wendy's?  Our family used to really like your chicken AND burgers!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's EVER!!! Always order a BBQ chicken sandwich no matter what Wendy's I go to and this is the only one I've been to that can NEVER get it right...and when you go back they never apologize and act like it's an inconvenience to them. Whoever the franchise owner is needs to seriously pay attention to the reviews and comments people are leaving."}
{"text":"I don't go often, but every once in awhile when I get a craving for junk food I'll go here since it's so close to my house.  But the last couple of times I've been there, the drive thru has either messed up my order or the woman that works there seems like she hates her job and takes it out on the customers."}
{"text":"Last week I went inside to place my order since the drive thru line was out to the road.  I waited in line for over 5 minutes with only 3 people in front of me. Not a single order was taken. The lady behind the counter was busy rearranging cups and putting together orders for those already taken. There were about 5 customers that had place their orders that were in a state of limbo as they waited for their food.  After much discussion among the 8 of us that this was taking an extraordinary amount of time for \"fast\" food I left. This is not the first time I've had this long wait in the dining room.  Today I was in the area and went through the drive thru - even though the line was really long.  It was certainly quicker than my last visit to the dining room. On arrival back at my office I realized I did not have my order - I have someone else's order.  *sigh*   This location brings me nothing but sadness.  Sorry Wendy's.  You're in a great location for my office, but this is the last time I'm visiting. Too many order mishaps and the wait times are just too long in the dining room."}
{"text":"This place just plain sucks it was great about 5 months ago now a bunch of teenagers messing up orders at least for me it has happen twice in two weeks use to love it here but now it's crap and there's a little crazy manager always screaming haven't seen her lately wich I guess is the only plus sinse I always buy lunch here please let's get our Wendy's back even if u gotta have the little annoying lady manager"}
{"text":"Terrible, tasteless food Chicken Asiago sandwich was bland, dry, tasteless. Chocolate ice cream cup melted French fries over salted and cold"}
{"text":"All Wendy's locations are really going down hill. But this location especially is the worst of the worst. Not only do they get your order wrong, you get cold disgusting food that taste old and not fresh. Save your money and next door to chick filet."}
{"text":"Garbage........I ordered a burger with pickle, onion, and mustard only. I got a burger with everything. Take it back and tell them and I get a burger with pickle and onion....but no mustard...I go back and am given mustard packets. Cold ass chili and cold ass fries. I wasn't afraid but the freak show Mike P. describes is indeed entertaining. You have to wonder how they get the money for the garbage food."}
{"text":"NNo coke to drink & cup carriers. I was also charged 40 cents for American cheese whan help me out but that's how Society is"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst fast food restaurants. The employees have no pride in what they put out to the paying customers. Food preparation is not what they advertise on TV! The burgers are terrible, pre cooked and just thrown on the buns! Baked potatoes are so old or over cooked, that they're brown on the inside. The chili, not well cooked, beans inside chili, hard as hell!. \"Warning\" Do not patronize this place unless you can't do any better. I've had on three occasions to take my food back! No more. Three strikes you're out!!!"}
{"text":"Be Very Careful eating here! The cashier is sweeping and dry mopping, and bussing tables inside restaurant plus taking your money and not going nowhere near a face bowl to wash her nasty hands. She instead, help the cook prepare your food. When I called her out for it, she asked the manager, who by the way didn't wash her hands either or put gloves on. I told them, I was calling the Southern Nevada Health Department on Both of them. \"Do Not Eat at Wendy's on Washington & Rancho if you want to stay healthy\""}
{"text":"Tonight a friend and I went to Wendy's. the lady who was taking our drive thru order was so terribly rude. We pull up to the drive thru window and she doesn't greet us or anything just takes our money after 2 minutes of sitting there then takes another 5 minutes to give us our change! She didn't even say have a nice day or anything. Just silently handed us the change! After giving us numerous dirty looks like we were an inconvience to her. I come here quite often and have never been treated that poorly. I think you need to hire people you actually want to work and aren't rude to your customers. She needs fired. Her actions were just uncalled for. And not to mention she rang in the wrong sandwich so now I'm stuck eating something I didn't want. Thank you again lady for ruining my night."}
{"text":"so on december 9, 2016 i was in the mood for a vanilla frosty. now keep in mind, i am a kind hearted human being, i decide to order the new sriracha fries. Cashier was nice and was doing her job well. got my frosty in good time and i was just waiting on my fries. that was when disaster struck, my fries come out lookin like sheneneh from martin threw that shit together in like 8 seconds. i kept an open mind and accepted the fries and how about them shits come out colder than xavier wulf. i go back to tge cashier and she replaces the fries for me but i stood around watching 12 orders fly out the window and i finally get my fries, i see this shit looking as if channing tatum fucked the bag of fries that it came from looking on point as fuck. i ate my fries and for the resr of the time i felt a little better."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to mess up fast food...well this location has! Not the first time I've had issues at this location either! Ordered a kids meal for my 21 month old, asked for chocolate milk got fruit punch. We got apple slices instead of fries for him as well...they were molded, can't really tell from the outside of the bag except they had a lot of brown spots, so I opened them and they smelled horrible! Thank goodness I checked them or my son would have probably eaten a few. I have tried to call the store 5 times now and have gotten no answer. Besides all this, service was very slow, only 4-5 cars in drive through and maybe a few customers inside to go with the 8+ employees standing around inside. I hope no one at this establishment ever has to work in a real restaurant. Never going back."}
{"text":"Hours says open tell 11 pulled up at 10:45 menu is off people are inside they say they closed already lazy worst Wendy's ever"}
{"text":"This location has fallen very far from the tree.  Absolutely awful service.  Hardly anyone was in the place, and the employees acted like it.  One of the employees walked around the entire place touching walls and surfaces and in general being abnoxious and even brooming the floor before he was about to serve us food WITHOUT WASHING HIS HANDS.  We watched him touch a dozen other surfaces and serve the drive through without washing his hands.  It took us much longer than usual to get our food.  All of the fries were mushy.  This location has gone down the toilet.  They were missing menu items and didn't tell us before our purchase.  We had to remind them of the price difference to get a refund.  I asked the cashier, \"is that guy going to wash his hands, before he touched our food?\"  The cashier told him to wash his hands, and then proceeded to handle our food despite having his fingers all over the register and everything else.  We will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"Wendy's is ok. The only problem I have with this one is that they always run out of whatever it is we're craving. Whether it's nuggets or a baked potato. It happens 1 every 4 times we go."}
{"text":"We went there a few weeks ago, they just opens for lunch. However our food was still cold as ice.  11 am food should be hot.  I worked in fast food for over 6 years and I always served food that was hot.  I always would think, would I want my grandmother to eat that. If no, then I would make sure it was fresh. Not this Wendy's, cold food at the beginning of lunch. Terrible!!!"}
{"text":"I got a burger with fries and I even have to ask for KETCHUP now?!? Shoulda known better and checked the bag.  Maybe next time I'll make sure to ask them to wrap my burger up for me too just to make sure they don't forget.  Shame on you Wendy's"}
{"text":"Wrong order and no receipt???? When I get their and tell them what happened they gave me my correct order but how about compensating someone's time to have to drive their once again? And next time a receipt would be nice to know I payed for the correct order as well..."}
{"text":"I really don't go to Wendy's much, but after a long day of work and hungry children I stopped by, this location and got the rudest drive thru girl EVER!!! She asked how may I help you, and as soon as I started to order She Said Just wait..then said what is that you want..So I ordered with this rude girl...Got alllll the way home more than half my order was not there,Not even a damn receipt. So I called asked for a Manger, and they Had me talk to the AWESOME Tiffany  she was very nice and offered to replace my meal.. I didn't feel \"COMFORTABLE\" go back the same day, didn't want a surprise in my food . She said save the call in my phone and come back another time and I will replace the entire meal went back the next day got it..Thank you to Tiffany real appreciate the Great Customer service u should pass some of that hospitality on to your co-worker!!!"}
{"text":"Got to say the food is awesome the service is great and it looks really modern with a bunch of TVs and contemporary design.."}
{"text":"It is Wendy's. Lunch lines are long but they have the system down pat. Lines moves fast, food is hot and ready to go. Grab a quick lunch and keep on your busy way."}
{"text":"Thank you Rosale for the great service and a headache tablet. Most people ask how you are but don't really listen to the answer, Rosalie heard me say I have a headache and offered me some of her personal stash of excedrin. I was extremely grateful, she was extremely nice and I can say it was very sincere, don't know what you pay her but she deserves top dollar!!!"}
{"text":"Great group of staff at this place. Daniel, Michelle, Julia,and Alyssa made my trip enjoyable and this was the day before Thanksgiving!!! Always a good visit here for me."}
{"text":"Cold old French fries, paid for value meal and receive half the fries, my chicken sandwich was hard and cold. There was no line, no wait, and an army of employees working there is no excuse to take a customers money and give them old food. I felt like o relieve left overs after a whole day long purchase."}
{"text":"The food? Great. Service? Train your employees better. We ordered 3 medium combos and got one (rest were small), and ordered a chicken wrap and didn't get it. I dont know if it was lunch rush, but the service was bad. Go to Harvey's for lunch. It's not as rushed."}
{"text":"Worst wait times ever, staff is inefficient. It doesnt matter if the store if updated with a fancy facade, wait times average 15 minutes to 40 minutes for drive through during peak times. If youre going to run a fast food joint the keyword is \"fast\""}
{"text":"I came here for a Wendy's salad for lunch one day. Terrible experience! You'd think all franchise operates the same, and have a certain quality control....the salad that I got that day was not fresh, some veggie turned yellow. For a salad that cost almost $10 , I don't think that's acceptable. On a stressful work day like what I had that day, and when was just craving for some good quality quick lunch, this just made my day worse."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst Wendy's that I have ever been at period. Even the restrooms were a mess!  The register person couldn't even get the order correct. I am really giving it a zero star rating."}
{"text":"Do not go here. I was at this location yesterday and had the worst visit of any restaurant or fast food location ever. There were workers sitting on the counters where food is being prepared the got off and turned around and continued preparing food without cleaning. Not to mention there was a workers kid running around the kitchen. Two workers were talking on the phone when we stood waiting to order another was texting at the cash register while we waited. They were cursing and blatantly ignoring us. Not a single table was clean and the food ended up making us all sick. And as we left a worker was smoking at the door forcing us to walk thru her puff of smoke."}
{"text":"I went here and the service was just not good from the start, everyone there is just completely rude and gives you dirty looks and people just don't help you when you need something there"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's, waiting 10mins on the mic 20 mins on the window, the only reason I waiting was because I was doing laundry next door"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is one of the slower ones I've experienced. Their food is pretty much the same as any other Wendy's you'll go to, the difference is that it takes a lot more time to get your food at this Wendy's. They always seem understaffed and no matter the number of people in line, it always takes forever. I'm going to avoid it in the future because if I want to wait for my food, I'll go somewhere with higher quality food!"}
{"text":"Ripped me off!!!! ordered a value size cheeseburger and a small coke . gave them a 20.00 gave me back 11.00 and some change"}
{"text":"Standard Wendy's fast food.  Nothing more nothing less.  Visit was brief and uneventful."}
{"text":"Very poor attitudes at this location got to the window for my order it wasn't ready they then asked me to pull back around because there timer was running and my order would be ready in 3 minutes. The last Time they did this to me it took me 15 minutes to get through the long line of cars so I said no then the girl started to argue with me then slammed the window in my face VERY RUDE and NOT customer oriented."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! Every Wendy's I've been to has surprisingly good quality for fast food. This was awful! My burger was cold my bun was ripped up with an onion on top of the bun. Not what I'm use to from Wendy's. You can tell my burger was sitting for hours and they tried to warm it up and give it to me, I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"Just left this place and I'm very unsatisfied with there service. First it took the cashier 15mins to understand what I was ordering and another 10 to get my order into the register. Then I was frustrated because I could not understand his broken English. Then after that he does not give me my change back as if he does not owe it to me. When I asked for my change, he then try's to give me less then what he owed me. I have no problems with any race of people! All I ask is that you hire and train people to do there jobs. And please make sure your workers can communicate with your customers or they will stop coming back!"}
{"text":"Eww. I ordered a cheeseburger from this spot, & was so grossed out by what they served up. Not normal, even for the low standards Wendy's has conditioned us to accept. For $1 a cheeseburger you might as well go to Waffle House, always open with $1 cheeseburgers too. At some point, customers will need to wake up to the fact that they are not in the business of serving good quality food for reasonable prices, they just want to take the money, & will leave you with a bag of nasty crap the dog shouldn't eat if that's what they think it takes to get your $1."}
{"text":"These guys have the fastest fast-food drive thru in the city. They get it right and quick and it's hot and fresh.  We already know Wendy's has great burgers and fries, but this place takes it to the next level by getting it to you quickly, even if you place a special order.   It's so fast sometimes you think they gave you a bag of shit or something in place of your order. But it's always good and done right. You can't say enough about service like that....."}
{"text":"This location could be the slowest in Las Vegas. I can't tell you how many times I have walked out after waiting 15-20 minutes. Orders are usually wrong and the hired help could be a lot more helpful. As of right now the cashier is having all sorts of issues with a very simple order. You're much better off going to Burger King across the street."}
{"text":"Today, I had seriously the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. I have a feeling that the manager was not in.  All five of the employees that I saw were under 18 (which, as a 21 year old, is not entirely an ageist comment). Even though there were only five customers in the store, it took nearly 20 minutes to prepare all five orders, after they were already taken. The cashier also had a lot of trouble counting money--her goal was to give me back $7.02 in change, but took the $5 out, said \"Oh shit,\" out loud, thought for a second, and then I reminded her that I need $2.02 more.  All five orders had exactly one item missing from their trays, and all of them were things that the cashier was responsible for. She forgot my chips for my taco salad, the cheese for two other customers, an incorrect drink for another. My drink wound up having zero carbonation.  I finally made my way to the condiment counter, which had ketchup smeared all over it, including on the stack of ketchup cups. There were literally zero napkins, so I had to go ask for some from behind the counter.  Many of the tables had a stray napkin or straw wrapper. While eating at one of them, one of the employees was in the dining room, yelling towards the counter (from about 20 feet away), \"Can you please tell Gary to fucking change these garbage cans?\" about five times. The cashier responded that she doesn't want to \"yell\" at Gary again.  As I cleaned my tray, I discovered the reason the garbage cans so desperately needed changed--I tried all three in the restaurant, but all of them were so full that I could barely open up the swing door on them, let alone put anything inside. I finally settled for putting my full tray on top of the entire garbage receptacle, for I had no other option.  None of this is exaggeration. I was seriously appalled."}
{"text":"Seriously the fastest service I have ever gotten at any fast food restaurant. I ordered about 6 items, went to the window right after, and they were already waiting for me with my food ready. I was out of there in 1 minute. Just thought I would share!"}
{"text":"We came here pretty early and it was not really any other people around. My burger was cold. It was wrapped into one of these aluminum wrappings to keep the food warm so I guess my burger was lying around lonely already a while. I let my husband taste just to make sure I am not overrating the temperature and he said the same thing: the burger was cold. Won't come back, sorry not sorry"}
{"text":"I work in the same complex as this Wendy's, and with limited fast food around, I wind up here quite a bit for lunch. I've been at my job for the past four years. And let me tell you, this Wendy's has always been awful. The staff are far from friendly. I've stood at the registers while they chit chat near the back with not a care in the world. They look up, see me, and continue on talking.  The manager is the rudest manager I've ever encountered. The staff is monotone. There's a new worker every few weeks. They're always hiring, and now have signs all of the windows, doors, the counter where you order, and all over the table. They're desperate. And it shows in their work etiquette why they are so desperate for new workers.    The food, though? It's just like any other Wendy's. I personally prefer the location on Tatum & Bell, though."}
{"text":"Will not return to this Wendy's.  Orders are consistently wrong,  fries are old and management is no help.  I've tried over and over but never had one good experience. Other Wendy's locations are fine,  this one, not!"}
{"text":"When I asked the guy in the drive thru for more time he responded with \"what do you want to order\". He then didn't give me the total at the speaker so when I pulled up to the window he held my food out the window and just looked at me when I asked what the total was he rolled his eyes at me then told me. After giving him money he grabbed it handed me my food and slammed the window I sat there for a second waiting for my change but I saw him walk away so I just drove off not wanting to wait around for it. I get its a fast food place and it's a drive thru but if you wanna be an asshole go work at a job where you don't have to communicate with people."}
{"text":"Hamburgers, fries, soda and of course a frosty.  Likely the hamburger Gave me food poisoning Friday night.  My husband and son were ok, and they had nearly identical meals.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to tow our vehicles for parking in their lot on Veterans Day because Denny's was too packed. You can't give up your business for one day that's why you have a drive thru. How rude. I'll never give my business to someone like that, get out of my country."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's I've been to. The employees are lazy and don't want to go out of their to be helpful. They never get the orders right."}
{"text":"I wouldn't even give this place 1/2 a star! They treated my family and I so terribly. I came back in the store after going through the drive thru because my brothers burger was extremely tough and grissely! The bacon was cold too! So I went and nicely explained my case and the guy says \"whaddya want me ta do?\" in the most rude tone ever! Just don't waste your time with the negativity and horrible food from this place and go across the parking lot to Arby's instead, they are super nice there."}
{"text":"On a remarqué mon camion pendant que j'étais à la banque. Belle façon d'accueillir les gens!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Guy @ window said NOTHING to me. I handed him my cc he handed it back w reciept. Guy dressed like a mgr (short bald w glasses) handed me 2 bags - window closed he walked away.WTF Dave - the company misses you!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Got the 4 for $4 which featured fries (old) and nuggets which tasted as tho they had been cooked in rancid oil. Could not understand the person working the drive thru and had to ask her to repeat herself a number of times. To her credit, she was very friendly when we got to the window. Won't be returning to this store!"}
{"text":"I live down the street & every time I drive by this place, the thought always comes to my head: \"This place doesn't look like it serves decent fast food\"   I should've listened to myself.  Went through the drive through & ordered a number 2 lol...... It was literally cold, had to put it in my microwave, tasted like it was out for awhile, pretty old. The frosty had the straw wrapper at the bottom, didn't see it in there till it got sucked in through my straw & tasted the paper, my cup of soda was almost completely full of ice, a lot of ice little drink. And not even 15 minutes after finishing this terrible meal I'm already sitting on the Jon number two-ing this stuff, so unless you like the runs- I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would!  The drive thru service here is totally ignorant. All they have to do is read the screen and put the right food in the bag, in my case put the right amount of food. I've been here 3 times and every single time they have forgotten something. This is my first review and last from this place. Go down the road and get your orders right!!!  This management here is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"Guy doing the frys dropped the long gadget he was stirring with ( he had 2 ) dropped one across the trashcan right below the fryer. I told the manager, she spoke to the young guy. She said he was putting it in a holder but if he had did that the gadget would have been upright not horizonal. The tables were nasty. Chose several tables before we found a clean one. The entire time we were eating our meal the guy kept starring at me. Will never go there again ."}
{"text":"Food good as always. Service very slow. The time we were there we spent it hearing the manager yell at the employees \" if you're standing still I'm going to send you home\".  Over and over, or \" where's my frys I need frys\" still yelling. We were sitting on the farthest wall and she was louder than the music being played.Just annoying listening to the manager."}
{"text":"Really ZERO STARS!!! I don't know why but they can't get my order right. The order taker gets it right because when I check my receipt, it is correct. The food in the bag is ALWAYS WRONG. My kids like Wendy's but we will not try it again. I called once because they didn't include one of the meals. Went back to get it and they still messed it up. It's fast food, how hard is it to get right?"}
{"text":"The absolute worst Wendy's I have ever visited. Service was slow and not very friendly. Dining room was dirty and ice all over the floor at the drink machine. In spite of hardly any customers in restaurant, not one employee was doing anything to clean the area. Don't know who owns this franchise but it should be taken from them!"}
{"text":"Wendy's has great burgers and fries, we all know that. But the other day at this Brentwood location I experienced something I never thought I would at any fast food joint. The girl taking our order at the drive-thru window was...actually...HAPPY. It was weird and it took us by surprise. She was polite and courteous and welcomed us to a \"fantastic Wendy's on a fantastic day\". The first instinct was that something was wrong. This girl must hate her job so much she has resorted to a very dangerous level of sarcasm to get through the day. But she was the real deal.... \"What makes this place so fantastic,\" I asked her as she opened the window. \"I just like working here,\" she responded. \"It's fun.\" Fun? Jesus, I worked at Wendy's for a short spell during high school and I would never describe it like that. But I was fired for conduct unbecoming a Wendy's employee. And if I was fired for that, this girl should be given a medal or at least a raise for actually taking pride in her work. There has been a large deficit of customer service in the world -- at fast food places especially -- for the last decade, but how truly refreshing it is to deal with someone who likes her job. It shows and makes customers want to come back....."}
{"text":"Why would manager gave me burnt chicken tenders (4 pieces) on purposed? Manager need to be fired!"}
{"text":"wendys burgers suck square patty frozen on the inside on a round bun with mayonnaise...no good   chili is good   i hear from a friend chicken is also good not verified"}
{"text":"The last 2 times I have been to this Wendy's it has been some of the worst service I have ever experienced..The person taking our order was very rude. It was very slow at 8pm on Halloween night and the service was also very slow. The guy taking our order was very confused and ask for help and the girl behind him rolled her eyes and walked away. We were shorted a drink, told them we had another one on the order and it irritated them. Then we realized we were shorted a fry and after the guy tried stuffing it in the bag with 5 burgers and 4 fry's I suggested they use another bag and they handed me one to let me repack them correctly. All this with them hardly speaking a word....sorry, thank you? nothing but a couple grunts. The family 1 person behind us in line did not get waited on all this time and when they heard the guy and girl argue about who has to take their order they walked out. we got home with our order and of course 1 sandwich was wrong but realized we had an extra burger. Toatly insane and very sad that this could even happen in a place of business where customer service is so important.  Wendy's has great food and it is a shame the management must not care because they know they will get the business anyway for the most part."}
{"text":"It gets one star for being slower than most Wendy's and opened only until 12. This is a college campus, people are up all night, it needs to be open atleast until 2. Terrible marketing if you ask me. Value menu sucks, worst Wendy's I've been to. I mean what can someone expect from a Wendy's anyway? Oh, I don't know LATE night food   and cheap prices for cheap food. Well this one has neither. Awful business."}
{"text":"Came over here to save on some cash since everything else in Vegas costs almost an arm and a leg, and wow what a life saver it was. Their chicken nuggets tasted as awesome as they normally do and so did the frosty. If you need that quick Wendy's fix when your on the strip and your strapped for cash, this place is a winner! 5th star is for being right across the street from the hotel where I had stayed (Wynn)."}
{"text":"The Staff was not very nice or helpful. It was trashed inside and the food was not very good. I will never be coming to this establishment again. I would also not recommend this to others. Very bad. Would recommend that this establishment closes."}
{"text":"They generally get my order right, but management needs to do a better job at training their staff. When I pulled up to the window and I was given my order, I was not greeted with a professional greeting but rather \"HERE\". Really, here? Come on give your people the tools for their next job and teach them how to be polite and the proper way of dealing with customers. Here is not something they should even use at home. I fault management."}
{"text":"We have had probably the worst experience ever at any restaurant... The \"manager\" Claudia is a horrible person who is rude, and should not have a job any place that she has to deal with people.  Took close to 30 minutes from the time we got into the store till we got the food. She was rude to both my wife, and to other customers, then I hear her on the phone to probably her boss saying that some customrs are probably going to be calling to complain but they are all idiots. Horrible and I hope wendy's takes care of this problem. We will never ever eat at another Wendy's"}
{"text":"Wendy's, the second level tier of fast food deliciousness.  In the mood for an Asiago Ranch Chicken Club sandwich I was about to head straight to the drive-thru as usual and noticed a sign for a new Coke machine which lets you create over 100+ combinations of soft drinks.  Filled with thoughts of the drink concoctions I used to make at Sonic drive-ins in the States I immediately parked and proceeded inside.  First thing I noticed is that they completely renovated the dining area.  Now, I haven't actually been inside the Wendy's for years, so this might be old news, but it was definitely clean and modern looking.  After paying for my food and getting a cup I went to the Coke machine, made myself a mouth watering Vanilla Sprite and it was the greatest Christmas day of my life (minus the Christmas part)."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever! They didn't have the drink I ordered and they had me waiting without letting me know, finally I get told that they don't have my drink and asked if I wanted something else; when I told them what I wanted they still had me waiting. I understand they can get busy, but schedule more people or at least give heads up that you are working in something or that they'll be right with you....don't just leave people standing around like they don't matter"}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the slowest Wendy's on the planet. I just spent 15 minutes in the drive thru with only 3 other cars"}
{"text":"Good food WHEN they get it right. I go here a lot. One out of every two or three visits they seem to mess something up big time. I also wish I could figure out why no one there smiles. Ever. Oh, except for the guy on drive thru. He's a hoot!"}
{"text":"I love this place, in my experience fast service and they never mess up orders. Their burgers are better than McDonald's and Burger King, and those are the other two big chains in the city. Spicy chicken is awesome, it's my favorite menu item"}
{"text":"This Wendy's during lunch is absolutely awesome. I would challenge any other fast food restaurant to do better than then. You literally give you order pull up given the money and your food is there."}
{"text":"Crap restaurant, I was  just in there and overheard the manager saying \"stop taking orders\" I assumed he said that because he thought it was too much to handle. It really wasn't busy. The restaurant needs all new employees and management  #sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"First of all let me say I love Wendy's except for the San tan village location.  Order chilie and got tomato paste with beans and meat. Call and spoke to \"Manager\" he said it's a little thick but that's the way it's supposed to be. I had chili at two different locations and it's as perfect...  This is YUCK!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a below average Wendy's although as other have mentioned, your options are limited in this area and this is probably your best bet.  I have experienced long delays here in the drive through (20+ minutes with 5 cars in frort of me to start.)  My order has ultimately been accurately filled though.  The food is normal Wendy's fare.  The interior is fine and can get busy at lunchtime.  It is not especially clean, but not egregiously dirty either. On the low end of normal. I have never felt unsafe here."}
{"text":"I would give it no stars if I could. I went there Saturday, bit into a burger and it tasted like fish. I immediately became ill. The management was none too concerned. I was told it must have been random because they pulled the sleeve of meat and there was nothing wrong with it. All I know is I vomited in their bathroom and my daughter became ill. If you value your digestive system, I would steer clear of this location."}
{"text":"This used to be my local Wendy's back in the day and I used to frequent it a bit too regularly for the Spicy Chicken Sandwich.  I don't really recommend fast-food or chains but I have fond memories at this particular one.  Gotta luv using french fries as a fork for your frostee and seeing it partially melt around the fry."}
{"text":"Their salads are so fresh and green every time I stop for lunch here, and everyone has always been friendly. It's a nice clean atmosphere inside too, and I love the fresh flowers on the tables!"}
{"text":"Nice location but the customer service isn't great.  I have not been back since a bad experience."}
{"text":"I don't go to this location very often even though it close to me and I pass it everyday.  The service is horrible and the staff just seems to argue and not want to be there.  Drive-thru service sucks you might as well park and go in but then again you will be waiting just as long. I enjoy Wendy's food but won't be stopping in due to the service and staff."}
{"text":"Would it hurt to smile and say thank you?  These girls seem miserable. I have been to this location several times and same thing, no smile, no thank you, they act like the customer is a total inconvenience for them.  Here's an idea,  Quit!"}
{"text":"Wow, I've never seen employees who have more attitude and incompetence than the ones at the ILLINI UNION WENDY'S. Read the last paragraph for a summary.   Long story short, I specifically ordered a burger and fries ONLY from the dollar menu. I was charged for a 4 for 4 and afterI correcting their mistake I was told they couldn't refund it. After protesting and asking AGAIN for my original order I was offered a free meal along with the 4 for 4 that wasn't refunded. I don't understand why they couldn't post void the order. The food hadn't even been made...  The employees clearly took their time to make the order, doing everything they possibly could except for actually cooking the food (cleaning out the back of the grill and frosty machine, sitting in the break room...etc.) After getting my food & realizing they didn't put the fries in (which is part of the 4 for 4), I asked for the fries and was told that I only wanted the nuggets and burger. Since I paid for the 4 for 4 I asked for the fries. The two employees proceeded to argue with me until the \"manager\" just said whatever and shoved the fries at me.   I came back the next day to get the free meal that I was promised because they weren't able to charge my correct order. The same two employees were working that day. When I asked for the free meal they said that I already got the 4 for 4 that I wanted yesterday. As I mentioned earlier, the free meal was because of their mistake. One specific employee (named TENIA) started raising her voice at me saying that I already got what I wanted. After her manager told her to give me my meal, she proceeded to talk to me in an extremely condescending and rude tone.   Overall, after reading the other reviews of this place I won't go back again. The employees move extremely slowly and are completely unenthusiastic. More importantly they are condescending, argumentative, and rude. I will also forward my experience to the Illini Union Board. I understand many of us working part-time jobs are students, but if you can't even be civil while doing your job you shouldn't be working."}
{"text":"Never got to try the food because nobody made eye contact or tried to take my order, REALLY??? for fast food, MAJOR FAIL!!!"}
{"text":"Slow is the name of the game here. Often times you will pull up to the drive thru and have to wait 5 minutes for someone to come on the speaker to take your order. They do seem to get the orders correct most of the time but it's one of the slowest drive thru windows I have ever witnessed. Needs better management to help drive consistent performance"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is great. Is quick to drive through. The staff is very friendly. I can hear them and understand them on the InterCon. And their interaction with me at the window is always very pleasant. My usual item to get here is a chocolate Frosty. I've gone at different times of the day. They are open late which is very convenient if you're looking for a late night snack."}
{"text":"Prob not coming back here very soon, I went through the drive thru the other day to get some lunch for my kids and I only to be rushed along by a rude employee when trying to decide what to get then repeatedly asking is that all, food was carelessly thrown together..."}
{"text":"Let's just say I made a yelp account just so I can tell everyone how HORRIBLE this service was. Three people were in line in front of us. It took us all at least 25 minutes to get our food . (I ordered 1 burger)   There were five people behind the counter . One was on her phone , the other 4 were laughing and telling jokes about a previous customer they didn't like. They were standing in a circle talking while there were 4 orders on the screen that hadn't been touched !!!   They scowled at a girl who asked for a refund because they were taking so long. They also lost our orders, so they asked to see our receipts so they knew what to make after standing there for 20 mins.  Perfect description of worst customer service ever.!"}
{"text":"Drive thru is ridiculously slow!!!.fries are soggy like a wet sponge. The only reason I go to Wendy's for their burgers kill McDonalds burgers!! I won't be I won't be ordering my French fries from them again"}
{"text":"Great service! This Wendy's is clean thru out. The sitting area is clean, tables clean and Windows clean. The bathrooms are clean and those who work here are clean and friendly. Very good customer service!!! A young lady even offered mints and checked on customers. That is abnormal and very kind."}
{"text":"The woman who took our order, Kathie, was obviously displeased to be there which was very clear by her rudeness, waving her hand at us, and not repeating our order. Our food came out correctly and was delicious, everyone else was nice and helpful but out first contact with an employee was so unpleasant that it set the tone for the whole meal."}
{"text":"I try this Wendy's every six months or so in hopes one day they will magically get better. It has yet to happen. Today's service was the usual snail's pace. Food was tasteless, cold, and they left out my son's chocolate milk. Clearly the fries had been sitting around for a while.   We don't have a ton of options in Mint Hill, it's a shame this one has to be so bad."}
{"text":"Never at this location! Wendy looked great with the new updated exterior but the wait at the drive through was horrible. First problem I discovered when I got home that one of my burgers was missing, OK strike 1. Next one of my kids jr bacon cheese burgers has a piece of bacon that was literally BLACK!! (Who looks at that and decides it ok to put on a burger) Strike 2. I call the store with my receipt and everything and explain the problem, I was told they can not refund me and will write it down in some book that I can get the burger I PAID for the next time I go in....Really. I told him to don't wish to come back to his store anytime soon and was hung up on. Strike 3. I called immediately back giving them the benefit of the doubt that we were disconnected and now there is no answer..... Strike 4!? (what kind of game has 4 strikes) I then emailed the district manager because the info was on my receipt and I'm pretty mad now!  Over two weeks later still no reply! Not expecting much more than an apology but cant even get that! So strike 5!? (who's counting) STAY AWAY, NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"My fries were pretty cold and the spicy chicken Sandwhich was wet almost. It just seemed like it was old.."}
{"text":"Just left here almost an 1.5 hrs ago walked in didn't get acknowledged knowing they were busy with the the drive thru, I gave them a few mins. At which point a cook came walking out stared at me as she spoke with fellow employees and still nothing for a couple of mins. Until another woman walked in and was acknowledged how can I help you, not until I spoke up stating, \"so this is how this works,\" did two more employees come walking out oh sir I'll help you now. Needless to say I was so mad I just I'm good and walked out."}
{"text":"Wendy's food should be about the same regardless of location. This review is not about the food, but the service.  I stopped here today on my way to Rocker World. Wow, what a mistake. The food was fine, but I've never seen slower fast food service in my life. I waited 10 minutes in line with 2 other orders in front of me and another 10 minutes for the food.   I'm still deciding if the new fries with sea salt are as good as the previous fries.....  Unless you have lots of time, you may want to hit another location."}
{"text":"The drive through took 20 minutes for three shakes and a fry, and then they took another customers order for several minutes without giving us utensils or napkins. The whole process took 25 minutes. The person running the drive through was rude about the fact that our dues weren't ready, and seemed to be mad at us for wanting spoons and napkins."}
{"text":"Couldn't get served. When i pulled around saw a woman with a broom in one hand her cellphone in the other. Tweeting is more important than service."}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars, I would. Worst Wendy's experience I've ever had. I stopped in on my lunch break around 1:30pm. No one was in line. I placed a to go order for a salad and fries. I waited as more people came in, ordered and got their food. It was 25 minutes until anyone asked me what my order was. It took almost 10 more minutes before they finally got around to giving out my order.. an order that really didn't require any cooking to begin with since the fries were pre made and my salad didn't have meat. I'm a fairly patient person but I chose fast food for a reason.. the whole ordeal made me severely late getting back to work."}
{"text":"Worst location in the city. We frequent Wendy's and avoid them specifically. They constantly short order us (so we get home and don't have all the items we paid for) and the food is never that fresh. Just, the worst."}
{"text":"It's freaking Wendy's already, what do you expect? Decent for fast food, Micky D's would get zero stars."}
{"text":"A PLASTIC GLOVE IN MY BURGER!?!?!This is most disgusting restaurant I have ever been to (those in 3rd world countries included). My order was To-Go via Drive-Thru and while on the road, I took a 2nd bite from the burger (combo #1) and a large piece of plastic was  being pulled out from the burger by my teeth. I nearly vomited right then and there. Not only was the cheese not even slightly melted, but there was someone's own ripped off finger portion of a plastic glove in the middles of the burger. I hate ever returning food but no way was I going to be charged for something so revolting. When I brought it back and showed them ripped glove with the burger juices still on it, the manager was unsurprised and unapologetic. Sure, I did not ask for an apology, but it should have been given under the circumstances. At least some ounce of mortification for such a horrible health violation would have been a comfort that this kind of thing was a  rare occurrence. Clearly, health, hygiene, and customer service is clearly not important to them."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant  and great welcoming staff if you go inside. The drive thru staff was not nice and helpful I had to ask questions in order to to get things and said have a great day with a blank stare in return."}
{"text":"Where to start with this wendys....on any given day it is not abnormal to have even simple orders screwed up ex: jr bacon cheeseburger no tomato med fry large coke....recieve reg jr bacon with tomato med fry and have to remind them i receive a drink as well! If your lucky and carry a rabbits foot and a 4 leaf clover in your pocket you might be able to purchase a baked potatoe without having to be told that will be 45 mins-2hrs....wish i liked mcdonolds more because unfortunately this is the only wendys near by and its more than often a disappointment."}
{"text":"*****ROACHES AND MISMANAGEMENT!!!***** Disgusting. I was sitting with my family enjoying a hamburger, when A ROACH CRAWLS UP onto the table from underneath the table! We immediately notified the manager, \"Renee\", to which she simply replied 'Ok' and walked away. She simply did not express ANY sort of concern or even any interest in our situation! Never returning to this location.  - The roach was of the smaller kind of roaches, of the type which typically infest kitchens, obviously signifying a larger infestation brooding underneath the surface.   *DO NOT EAT HERE!*"}
{"text":"Had the new Gouda Chicken on Brioche with a side garden salad. Pretty standard menu fare. The \"brioche\" didn't really add much to the overall flavour. The gooey brown sauce pretty much took over. It looked like weird jelly upon dripping out the bun. The chicken was alright, decent size and thickness. Wasn't dry. Wish I tasted the Gouda a bit more.  The salad was fresh and crunchy here. Ranch dressing/vinaigrette was meh. Apparently 1/2 the calories of their BBQ ranch dressing, whatever that is. Tastes like half the calories too."}
{"text":"horrible service staff is incompetent  I came here one day with around an hour of free time.  I ordered 2 jr hamburger deluxe's and a small fry.  I was joined by about 6 other parties waiting for similar orders.  The lady on till kept taking orders without filling them and after about 30 minutes she was confused as to who ordered what.  once i reached the 50 minute mark i had to get my 5$ back and left hungry.  the worst Wendys location in Calgary its with the 10 minute drive to the Westhills location."}
{"text":"I wondered into this Wendy's on a cold September night. I had my trench coat buttoned up to my neck because there was a slight breeze about. I felt famished, so I thought I would dabble in the culinary tastes of this inviting Wendy's. Little did I know that my life would change that very day. I walked in expecting a burger, little did I expect to discover the true meaning of love and life, pleasure and pain, and the answer to all of life's toughest questions. I went up to the counter where a very handsome, devilish, man was working the register. He had a smile that would warm up even the coldest of hearts. As I ordered my usual 3 double cheeseburgers off the dollar menu, which I believe the new name is the \"value menu\", but we will get back to that. Anyway, as I placed my order the cashier smiled at me and asked \"would you like some fries with that?\" It was at this moment that I felt my first Wendy's orgasm, or as I now like to call it, \"Wendgasm.\" As I sat down and took my first bite of the forbidden fruit known as a \"Wendy's burger\", or as I like to call it, \"Vibrator on a bun.\" This pleasure filled sandwich will make your taste buds yearn for some juicy sauce if you know what I mean. I can safely say that I have gone back every day since then, and I now carry a condom on my penis upon entry, did I mention I'm a man?"}
{"text":"March 20, 2016 - They messed my order up again. This wouldn't be too big of a deal nor would I write them a negative review, however this is coupled with an \"I hate life and I hate you too\" attitude of the girl and tattooed guy working the drive-thru and the general lack of professionalism (even for a fast food place!) that is present here. The people working the kitchen and drive-thru window just looked kinda nasty and made me lose my appetite. They really REALLY need some new, clean and somewhat friendly staff!  Maybe I'll try back in a few months."}
{"text":"Having just recently moved here from another state, I know Wendy's has good food and usually has good service. This Wendy's, however, has terrible service. My family and I went in there and ordered sandwiches and strawberry lemonades. The cashier taking our order was having a coughing fit. She turned around to make our lemonades and proceeded to cough on them. She gave them to us anyway! I pointed out that I had seen her cough on them, and she argued with me and then got angry and threw the drinks in the sink. Then she barked at someone else to get us new drinks. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible management,  by far the worst fast food restaurant I've ever been too.       I have had numerous issues with this particular location. We live nearby and this is one of very few options for late night food.  3 out of every 5 orders are incorrect or missing something. We always check our food in the parking lot, and even ask a few times while ordering or getting our food if everything is in the bag.     Avoid if you can"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Stood in line for a simple order of fries. The employees were working like they were not getting paid. And yawning loud while I was ordering. The fries were awful. Dumb adults there. Airport sucks too."}
{"text":"Went to Wendy's on 7th St. and Greenway for breakfast with my wife. They opened at 7. We were there when the doors were open. Two gentleman were ahead of us. The restaurant had approx 8 employees.we stood for five minutes, the employees totally ignored us, one of the men left. The other asked if someone could help him, a employee looked at him, didn't say a thing, turned her back and walked away! The shift Manager looked at as and said,\" we'll be with you in a minute\" Five more minutes went by and all the employees, and the shift manager still ignored us! We left! I eat at Wendy's all over the valley and generally the service is fast. Not at this location. The owners just went through a complete rebuild of the location and it looks great, but the service before the rebuild was horrible and that didn't seem to change, in fact it was the worse service I've ever had anywhere. If you are the owners of this location please do something about your poor attitudes of your employees and your management staff. Attitude is everything and it starts at the top."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Wendy's in a long time and decided it was time for an old-fashioned hamburger.  I went into the Wendy's located at 6899 Rockside Road Independence Ohio with several coupons.  It was nice to see Wendy's offer some coupons since the price of their hanburgers have and always been expensive (well except for that 1.00 menu that offers baby choices of food).  I came in with 4 coupons and the cashier asked for her manager and they accepted all of the coupons but I was told \"the next time you come in here you are only required to have one coupon per visit.\"  Horrible way to treat your customers.  A place of business that is lacking in customers in comparison to other fast food places and you say that.  Why would I want to come back to that place?  Well, probably the next time I come back they will have a large turnover in workers including the manager.  Was the food good?  It was delicious but just not a friendly place to purchase or eat/sit in to enjoy the food. I was thrilled I had taken the food out to enjoy with my family!"}
{"text":"Didnt ever bring my sweet n sour sauce out, and waited about 5 min for my small fry. Although they had very good customer service and was very clean. Hamburger was also cold"}
{"text":"Worst location ever if I could give them no stars i will.... I pay $18.55 for 3 crispy chicken and 10 pieces chicken nuggets it took them 30 minutes to fix my order the manager she have attitude like if it was her money the one that you paying with, she didn't even give ticket, at the end I got tired and I paid $18.55 for 3 crispy chickens 10 chicken nuggets"}
{"text":"Slooooooow. I'd understand if they were busy but they were not. Maybe 3 people in front of us with no one in the drive thru and took over 15 minutes for everyone's food."}
{"text":"This place was super disgusting before the remodel so we avoided. Now it looks good but 3 out of the last 5 times through the drive thru I've ended up with missing items when I get home. Guess I never learn. Just don't get fancy with your order like a substitution and you might be OK."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this place (usually I go after 10) the people that give you your food are always rude and never give you what you're paying for. The two men that take your order are always nice (older gentleman and African American man). When I got my frostys (best part about Wendy's) they were only half way full and instead of the young man filling them the rest of the way up he argued with me that that's how they do them even though every other time I get them and he's not there they are filled all the way! Terrible customer service most of the time. I would not recommend going to this location. After my visit tonight I don't think I will be returning to this location! HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"I go here all the time, fast drive thru service, not bad at all for for Wendys, they are generally not to busy, therefore the line up goes fast compared to the tim hortons line up on the other side, never had issues here been going close to 16 years now ever since they opened"}
{"text":"Updating the old review, food quality is still good and prices aren't out of line.  Adding Freestyle machines has helped with the drink quality and selection but they're still falling down on service.  I have never gone somewhere with consistently ruder people, there is one woman there who will seriously take your money and stare you down without saying a word the whole time.  Too many other places around that manage to hire people who have basic human interaction down."}
{"text":"Burgers are fresh and tasty. Doesn't have that stale taste of fast food. Plenty of seating upstairs. It's a nice lunch spot for me and my friends."}
{"text":"The staff was nice but didn't listen when our order was taken and some of the order was messed up. Some of the customers were very loud and ghetto. The tables could be cleaned better! I didn't want to go into the bathroom."}
{"text":"I don't think the management of this place will ever read this but I feel it's necessary to write this review nonetheless.  First off the food was excellent. My burger was thick, and juicy and up to par with what I would expect from a fast food joint. My wife's salad was mediocre due to what appeared to be older wilted lettuce. Again not a big deal considering it was around midnight. The part that really got to me is that this was the second time in two hours that I had visited and the line was long and slow. So much for fast food.   I had to drive away the first time I visited since the only movement in the line of nine visible cars was at the rate of one car in ten minutes. I was car number nine so imagine yourself in my position. When I came back two hours later I was car number three and got my order 26 minutes after I got in line. That's almost nine minutes per car. I don't know about you but to me this is unacceptable. I didn't want to return home empty handed an hungry so I braved the wait.   I'm not, nor have I ever been a restaurant manager but I would think that adding a little more help than just one cook and one cashier would probably increase productivity and efficiency of the orders.   In closing I honestly feel that this particular establishments manager/owner/proprietor knows that nothing needs to be changed. If we want their food bad enough we'll either wait, or go down the street to someone else. Either way he's still getting paid and Dave Thomas isn't around to say anything about it."}
{"text":"I would give them ZERO stars. Every time we use the Drive thru they provide horrible service. My hubby wanted Wendy's today and our order was wrong when we took it to him. We went back and they still didn't prove our correct change back.  They charged us for a triple when we asked for a baconator.  The manager Donna\"s excuse was they have a new cook and okay what's your Drive girls problem with her eyes rolling tonight. July 6, 2017 we will boycott them.  Horrible customer service and they steal Customer's money."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and they get the orders up fast. The prices are good the dollar burgers and fries are very good."}
{"text":"Food is fine. Manager could learn a bit about customer service. New employees don't seem to have been trained. Meh. What do I expect from fast food?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after flying in Monday afternoon around 3pm. Walked in, ordered, served quickly, drove away. The Spicy chicken sandwich was so chewy it seemed to be more cartilage than meat. If I hadn't been eating my first meal of the day and driving home I would have returned the whole meal. The decor and chicken were apparently the same age."}
{"text":"Always check your food cuz usually it's wrong I got a drink and didn't even give me a straw the one time I got a frosty they didn't give me a spoon I asked for ketchup they give me one packet but other than that the food is usually good I haven't had a problem getting bad food but like I said check it always cuz usually it's wrong or they forget something they also forgot to give me my debit card back the one time also I paid with a $50 bill one time and got three things off the dollar menu gave exact change and she tried saying that I gave her a $20 bill that was kind of shady to me needless to say that girl no longer works there they had to fire her after that because it was done multiple times I found that out because my friend also works at Wendy's"}
{"text":"This location needs a major make over. The manager is very arrogant, the place is filthy, probably best just to tear down this location.  I ordered a double PLAIN, I got it with everything. I ask the manager his reply was no one is perfect! I'll go to McDonalds next time."}
{"text":"Paid over $9 for a double burger without cheeze, fries and a small drink. Not a good value and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"One of the worst if not the worst Wendy's. First, it's filled with endless trashy people all the time located in such a crappy area. I would not be surprised if crimes take place there or near by all the time. You get the normal, working professionals during lunch hours but that's about it. Even the employees there act the same and they seemingly never stop act trashy and smoking near the entrances where customers go in and out. Food is okay but that's about it. Yuck!"}
{"text":"so I ate here and the food was really cold and not fresh. Do not eat here it's so horrible. although the cash register guy was really nice."}
{"text":"I don't like this Wendy's too much.   The Wendy's from where I'm originally from is really old but was renovated too look Starbucks-esque, has decent service, and is cheap. This Wendy's is brand new, but the layout looks really old and everything is more expensive.   The last time I went in there I waited by the abandoned cash register for 5 minutes while two workers chatted nearby. They didn't acknowledge me in anyway. When the cashier came she was friendly but was rushing to multitask while her coworkers chatted away.  EDIT:  They have a value menu now that is still kind of expensive, but I still give this place 2 stars.   EDIT 2 (April 2014):   This Wendy's now has the regular dollar menu (small frosty, crispy chicken, chili, nuggets, etc.). I'm guessing they did this to compete with the McDonald's that will be opening around the block in a few months. It looks like they have replaced some of their old workers with new ones that are more friendly. I go here every once in a while now. 3 stars"}
{"text":"Worst Wendys ever!! It's Summer and theres is no air conditioning. All the tables are gross and theres flies everywhere."}
{"text":"Had to be the worst experience I have ever had. Got double with cheese and fries to go. Burger had no cheese, toppings left off an others added, no fries and charged for all. I am guilty for not taking everything out of the bag and doing inventory, but don't think I should have to."}
{"text":"Wow, just WOW!  I've never met such courteous employees anywhere!  The drivethru staff today could not be beat!  Great job, folks!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Having been to this Wendy's on a few different occassion through the years, I should stop expecting anything more. The employees always seem like they have better things to do than take your order or give you your food. I thought maybe they just didn't like me personally but I see it's happening to others as well. Yesterday, I asked for their special and they said it was no longer available (even though the website says it is) so I ordered a burger and drink instead. They were not friendly in the slightest. When I opened my sandiwch to eat it, I saw the lettuce was see through. I didn't even bother taking it back. I just think I will avoid this particular restaurant completely in the future. It's been too many years of consistently bad service to keep thinking it will change."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS LOCATION! I live near here and I would never go back to that place. When this location first opened up in my neighborhood, their food quality was good. But now on my last 4 consecutive visits, their fries are SUPERRR salty and it tastes hard like it's been overcooked, their chicken strips are overcooked, and one time my friend's burger patty was still pink and uncooked in the middle!!! I gave this place too many chances and I would just avoid this place. They have terrible customer service too. They don't even deserve a 1 star rating"}
{"text":"Was very surprised by their frosty Yummy good. Their drink dispenser's are great with a wide multitude of soft drinks!!! Had baked potatoes , hot and delicious. Thats all today..."}
{"text":"I love this Wendys.  There Daves Double Burgers are so Damn Good.  The Baconator Fries Rule.  Carlos is the Koolest Manager over there."}
{"text":"We stopped by this location for a quick bite today.  We like the \"summer berry salad\" that we actually just had it at a different location a few days ago.  However, they didn't serve us with the \"summer berry salad\" with spring mix, strawberries & blackberries but gave us iceberg salad instead.  Even the picture on the ad also show spring mix vs iceberg lettuce.  That'y not cool! They shouldn't substitute the type of the lettuce as they do make a huge difference! Perhaps iceberg is way cheaper than spring mix?!"}
{"text":"Wendys is my favorite of all the fast chains, but this location is the worst. The girl at the drive thru speaker won't let you finish a sentence before saying \"is that it\". I get to the window when I'm told its a six minute wait on my spicy chicken sandwich. I finally get my food and the order is wrong all I ordered was a spicy chicken with no tomato and a chili with cheese. Tomato on the sandwich and no cheese in the chili. I've given this place several chances but the service seems to be worse everytime. The owner and managers should be embarrassed at the product they are putting out."}
{"text":"This place is nasty ass hell - I bought food last night and inside the burger the employees look like they spit on the food. The food was old ass hell and the front guy at the drive thru look dirty ass fuck. I'm disgusted and never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews on here (this is my very first) but I couldn't help but think this Wendy's deserves it.   I just moved to the area so decided to stop by at the local Wendy's for a quick lunch. Not only was the service all that I could ask for, but the serving sizes were great! Burgers were hot and juicy and the fries were amazing. No ketchup needed.   Job well done, Independence Blvd Wendy's."}
{"text":"I was on the phone asking for a burger the lady screamed at me making me uncomfortable I hung up and still never got my burger DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Excellent service! The manager was so friendly from the start, brought out food to our table like a restaurant. We didn't even get drinks and it was a small order, but she even offered us water. Never thought we'd get that kind of service at a fast food restaurant, but I can say it was the absolute best experience. The server was so thoughtful so we gave her a tip :)"}
{"text":"I liked the food bit they couldn't understand the order correctly. So I didn't get everything I ordered but wasn't charged any more than they gave me."}
{"text":"Stale bread on my burger, and the lady shut the window on me before I had a chance to tell her she forgot my Frosty."}
{"text":"They changed the building, now it's not the same, welcome feeling when you walk in. It looks less inviting and they have everything set up backwards. The kitchen resembles a prison kitchen and isn't very clean either. They have visual blinders in place so you can't see what they are doing to the food while handling it. The bathrooms require a token to enter, which is a hassle and time constraint for handicapped people like myself with Autonomic dysreflexia and have to use bathroom at once or possibly either die or have accident; though the tweeker girls who walked in, seemingly had no problem getting in right away to go do their drugs.  The young gal who took my order wasn't aware of the menu items but took my credit card and refused to see my ID for proof of ownership, stating, \"We don't have to verify it's your card. Nobody does that anymore.\" The burgers were extra greasy and the bacon was limp, thin, greasy but not crisp at all. The bun seemed drenched in grease. The fries were not as I remember them being and had a bad flavor. The over all experience was unfavorable. I felt we wasted $18. on crap and an aftertaste. Then after getting home and doing the online survey and expressing all of this, our home phone rang at 10:30 PM and it was the air head gal from that Wendy's location, calling at 10:30 at night, waking up the entire house, because she didn't approve of the review we wrote. Unknown to me, someone would access that info at the hands of local store employees and call our home in the middle of the night. I tried to locate my original review, although it does not appear any place to be easily located, so I am writing this review here to ensure it will be available for those who inquire. I have made the call to corporate to inform them of all this. I find it necessary to share this information even if less than favorable, as it provides a basis for improvement. I am not doing this to be malicious. I am sharing this experience in effort to prevent this from happening to others. I find it extremely tasteless that these young people with their \"Entitlement attitudes\" demanding $15 per hour, which raised the prices but not the quality of service or the product; need to wake up! This is not the way to run a restaurant or any business. When these youngsters grow up, they will have more opportunity in different businesses and potentially destroy those businesses the same way if they don't learn about consequences now.  Considering all of this is in response to what would have been a likely $8 hamburger purchase in years past, but was an $18 dollar hamburger purchase with a bad taste in our mouths, it should make people more aware of what is taking place behind the scenes. I advise those of you reading this review, that if you have the ability to park your car and go inside to order your food, you should take that moment to actually inspect the facility you are purchasing your food from and decide for yourself if it is clean, if this is the place you feel comfortable about placing your family's or your own health and stomach in the care of. Look around and be observant! Take the time and be honest in the way you review! Corporate manager did return my call and address the issues, informing me that she would be visiting this location tomorrow and meeting with the employees to discuss these problems. She also offered to refund me for our purchases. I feel the corporate manager is being fair and handling this the best she can. I just hope these young people reading this will learn from this and take employment more seriously, especially if they intend to continue working in the food industry. More over, it is imperative that every individual realizes they are being paid for performing what ever job they hold and they need to be responsible, perform their job correctly and offer their best effort at that job, which should not be a problem, since they are being paid to do it. Even if your job were cleaning toilets, you should be the best at cleaning them you are capable of and take pride in knowing you did the job well. I speak from experience. If I hadn't decided to be the best I was able when I cleaned toilets, I would likely not have learned and grown to the point to which I was able to excel and get to where I am today. The fact that cleaning toilets is a dirty job had little to do with it. The fact that I did my best and placed more value on myself and took pride in my work, rather than thinking about how much more money I thought I should have received for doing that dirty job, holds the answer to the \"why\" part about \"Why would anyone take pride in cleaning toilets?\". Those who strive to be the best toilet cleaners may one day make the best business leaders and management people. Those who complain and give only minimal effort will likely be cleaning toilets for the rest of their life if they can even keep that job."}
{"text":"Visited this location today, after an accident that messed up my face. Jayson graciously took our order without bringing attention to my injuries. He had such a sweet demeanor that made my first outing a comfortable experience.  My lunch was a peaceful one. Thanks Jayson!! 4 for $4 is a great deal, too. Decent amount of food and well worth the money."}
{"text":"Really fast. Fresh French fries is a plus I ordered paid and recieved my food in less than 3 minutes. The girl that was working was determined to be get me in and out fast."}
{"text":"Been craving a taco salad for 3 days!! Finally had the chance to get one...not impressed. The salad was old. As soon as I opened the lid I knew right away, the smell of old rotten lettuce with wet cheese hit right away. The one star I give is for the chilli, at least I could eat that part."}
{"text":"OK its fast food but there is nothing fast about this location. You will wait forever for your cold fries baked potato's and burgers. The buns are stale always they should not crumble and break in your hand. Cleanliness in the dining area ? Forget about it every time I have been there the garbage is overflowing tables a mess and break the condiment area a disgrace. Say something to a \"manager\" and the standard answer is always. \"We have been busy\" solution hire some people or at least schedule better . problem solved...."}
{"text":"I like Wendy's in general. Employees here seem very sad and moping around. The person that takes the order was definitely in a bad mood. When I didn't understand what she was mumbling she yelled the word \"drink \"at me when       she really should've said what flavor would you like we have...."}
{"text":"Really happy with this place, clean, fast and the best the good was fresh and well done, the right prices and good quality of food, better then McDonald's, for sure..."}
{"text":"This location is total crap. Staff sucks, leave your attitude at the door. Also, I found a dead fly on my ceaser side salad! Absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?"}
{"text":"Typical fast food.  A little pricey considering what it is.  Their hours are great, therefore if is a good place to chill for cheap after a movie.  Staff seems to hate working there. However I guess that's a fair attitude considering where they work."}
{"text":"From the outward appearance, this Wendy's is modern and easily accessible.  The inside is also very ergonomic and very nice.  That's about all the good I can say about it.    From the time we walked in, there was only one register open and the line was to the door.  The child in front of us even screamed he wanted to leave because he wanted to eat and he wanted it now!  We hesitantly waited 20-25 minutes and I wanted to leave but by then we had too much time invested.  We finally got to place our order and the line behind us was still to the door and the manager even popped up front but refused to acknowledge the crowd and lack of service being given.  Despicable!  To beat all, the chicken nuggets were cold and dry.  Service was poor and extremely dissatisfying.  I also noticed the drive thru was wrapped around the building and once you got in line, you couldn't get out because of the way it was poorly designed.  You're just stuck.  I don't think we were the only dissatisfied customers that day but I won't go back."}
{"text":"Walked in before closing time man named Matt was very front to tell us they were about to close and did not want to make us food. What kind of establishment there to make money denied the sale of their product. He gave us sass as we walked in saying really?! You're gonna walk in 6 people with a few minutes till close. The front door was open we walked in. This service was unacceptable I've never eaten at Wendy's and now never plan to. Thanks for the experience Matt"}
{"text":"this is the worst Wendy's I have ever eaten at, the service is extremely slow, I've been there twice and once they were out of French fries and the other they only had diet pops available. What kind of fast food restaurant runs out of fries and soft drinks!?!? By the way, the McDonald's next to it isn't good either."}
{"text":"the only bad thing about this location n is some of the ghetto clientele in the area.  the staff is very good.  polite and efficient.  the food is good Wendy's quality.  the store is clean and modern.  not sure about the other reviews but this location is the only store I go to on this intersection."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this location for a while now. My dad and I ordered lemonades with our meals (which you have to pay extra for). They tasted more like water then anything else because it hardly had any lemonade in it and it was filled up 3/4 with ice. We went up to the cashier to ask for a refill because there was no lemonade in the cups and she told us that she can't because that's not their policy. We told her that it was ridiculous that we paid extra for a cup of ice and she grabbed her manager who rudely told us that they can't offer us a refill. My dad told him that we have a choice on what fast food restaurant we go to and we won't be coming back. The manager stared blankly at us and just shrugged his shoulders. It's really not about the lemonade- it's just the sheer lack of customer service and the rudeness we experienced from the staff. Most places would simply just apologize and give us a refill. They just lost a customer and I will be making a complaint to their head office."}
{"text":"Please save yourself the time, money and stress and do not go to this Wendy's. We first went to this place just after it was built and the service SUCKED. Cold food, SLOW employees, terrible service, they don't know which way is up for ordering anything, constantly mess up orders, they just don't know what's what. And, it wasn't just this one time. Oh no. Maybe we're the stupid ones? We've still gone to this Wendys for YEARS. Why? I can't answer that. We know it's going to be terrible all around every time. Just recently, I was there and 3/4 of the employees were sitting on the patio outside talking and smoking. My guess is they weren't on break either. Probably five or six of them, while one or two were inside. None of them cared anyway. What's it matter... They have that many people and they still can't get anything right?   One day, I was just fed up with this place and went to go look for comment slip to fill out (not like they would read it anyway) or some kind of person who \"runs\" this sorry joint. No manager that I could find, and the comment slip box was empty. I will complain corporately about this Wendy's. It's almost as if they PURPOSELY hire bad, careless slow workers to work in this place. It's never the same employee every time you go. Frankly, they just do not give a hoot. At least you can sit in the corner away from the chaos and melt away your thoughts about the bad service while realizing your meal is cold, order is wrong and the fries are soggy while enjoying blaring loud Spongebob."}
{"text":"Wish I would've seen the reviews first before going to this Wendy's location!!!!  This is the absolute worst Wendy's I've ever been to and I've been to a lot!  Every person in our group had different items and they were all the worst we have ever ate at a Wendy's. The buns were not fresh, the fries were old, even the Frosty's were not right.   I had just drove by In n out burger and seen 25 cars in the drive-through line. When we arrived here we were the only ones in the restaurant. That should've told me something!    Whoever the manager was, he or she, obviously don't care if they serve good food or not. There were easily 50 chicken nuggets laying there ready to be served along with a mound of fries. Nothing in our order was freshly made and it definitely tasted like it. Ugh!  Wish I would of skipped dinner and not wasted my money or calories eating here!  Thumbs down"}
{"text":"Waited over half hour, only one in the restaurant, got home and the bacon on the hamburger was bad.  This used to be the best Wendy's not sure what happened.... I called and let them know about the bacon but...... Will not be going back !!!!"}
{"text":"Filthy restaurant and food was extremely salty. Nasty with a capital N. Never going back."}
{"text":"I don't get why there aren't more fast food places on state near campus. It seems like the perfect market (broke, drunk college kids) but I digress...  They remodeled the entire interior of this place, and the ordering/pickup area is now separate from the dining area, something that always caused a problem at the old TBell. The employees were extremely friendly and seemed like veterans even though the place has only been open 5 days. Service was SO FAST. I got my drink (from one of the two coke freestyle machines-i got diet Barq's vanilla root beer!) and when I was putting the lid on they called my name for my food. The burger was prepared very nicely and actually looked like what was on the menu board. The fries were a bit soggy and not too crisp, but not the worst i've ever had. I went at dinner time on a Friday and there was a bit of a crowd, with the manager asking people in line to \"form two lines\" near the registers. I can see this being an issue especially late at night with drunk folks not paying attention and slowing things down, but we'll see.  Clean, great service, and well prepared food. I hope management can keep the riff raff out so this place stays here for the long haul."}
{"text":"I'd give zero stars if I could just for the terrible service and idiots behind the counter.  I have always loved wendys. But this one is downright terrible.  Every time I go there my order is wrong, cold, or overdone. The staff have no clue what's going on.  My most recent experience with this particular wendys was about 9pm and I went to order the chili cheese fries, and a frosty. There was only one car in front of us. I heard them order and they only ordered 2 frostys. They spent at least 5 minutes at the window. It shouldn't take that long for 2 frostys. (Mind you they were NOT busy)  When I finally get to the window it was another two minutes or so before anyone came to take my money.  I was not greeted, she just opened the window and said my total and took the money. Another couple minutes later she pops back up to tell me they are out of the barbecue sauce for the fries, and did I want something else. Irritated, I say no I'll just take my money back. She then says, \"did you already pay?, can I see your reciept?\"  (This was the same girl who took my money two minutes ago)   I handed her the reciept, and she said they do have the sauce it's just in the cooler and it's cold, she can put it on the fries though. (No thanks I don't want cold fries) I had to wait another 5 minutes for the manager to come and give me my money back.   What a waste of time.  (This is the last time I'll ever go to this location)"}
{"text":"I ordered half a taco salad & 4pc chicken nuggets. I haven't been to Wendy's in years & forgot how good their nuggets are. I think they are the best fast food nuggets out there, in my opinion. I remember liking their taco salad so I ordered that, but was dissappointed with it. First they forgot to give me tortilla chips. All it was was lettuce & tomato & even when I added the salsa, chilli & sour cream it was still bland. But at the same time the salsa was really over powering. Not what I remember it tasting like, I used to really love this salad. They almost forgot to give me my nuggets too but luckily the guy at the window realized before I drove away."}
{"text":"Great fast food with a lot of healthy choices to pick from or you can just roll with the burgers and fries depending on your mood."}
{"text":"We went here bone night just for something quick, it was an ordeal... They messed up our entire order, it was a $40 order, we didn't realize until we got home and it was to late, and didn't want to sit in the drive thru again... After we were home we called and explained our situation, and were told to come back another day and they would replace the entire order.  This didn't go well for them either.. They messed it up yet again, it took them 25 minutes, and the girl on the grill was chomping on her gum while making the food. We were so disgusted and didn't carre to have it fixed yet again due to frustration and left.  My fiance wrote corporate, and the branch general manager emailed us asking us to call. We did. Only to leave a message and yet receive another email.  We will not be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"I usually don't do these reviews but I'm sorry this Wendy's location was horrible!!i ordered 6 items and I didn't get one of them but I got something else and I paid for it..when the kid took my order he didn't not repeat it back to me so I thought he had everything..I paid at the first window and then second window gave me the bags and said have a nice day!!did not ask me sauces or anything and I didn't realize until I drove away that I didn't get my frosty and I told him on the speaker..don't like this location and it sucks because when I got home I noticed everything was wrong!!!improve your customer service!!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is Wendy's. One of my favorites if I am forced to eat fast food. They were out of breakfast burritos, kinda upsetting because it was early in the morning. I was surprised by how good the sausage was ok the biscuit."}
{"text":"Terrible, this place sucks. I have eaten here often , due to being in close proximity to work, the employees seem to mosey around at their own convenience, take their sweet time taking your order, making the food., refilling your drink. They could learn a thing or two from Chic-fil-A"}
{"text":"I have to give this Wendy's a 4 star simply because they keep the line moving and get food out fast!  This location pretty much always has a line and yet that doesn't slow down production at all.  The person taking orders (quite possible that it's the owner) will also fill drinks at the same time and they are extremely efficient.  I love that Wendy's has chilli, small salads, baked potato, and grilled chicken wraps which make for a really great lunch.  I enjoy coming here and I enjoy how fast the service is."}
{"text":"11/30/2015 I work right around the corner from here and for a quick lunch I will swing through the Drive through and I'm back at work in minutes...  What's that they say - \"you get what you pay for\" ... Well that's so true in the case of this Wendy's. I will drive 5 minutes out of my way to go to the Deer Valley location from now on. The last two times my spicy chicken wrap has been cold, and I mean, cold cold. Today we asked the girl if they were suppose to be hot- She said yes. Told her how the last two times they were cold, she said they would be hot. Well, they were cold. And so was my fries and so was my co-workers chili. Not to mention in the drive through window, had to reminder her to put cheese on the chili that she forgot and the side of ranch that she forgot. Then to get back to the office, I find, there are no straws, no napkins, and no spoon for the chili. If the girl at the window, wasn't in such a rush, to get back to the empty restaurant, maybe our order would have been correct. And you think you should get paid $15.00 an hour - I think not."}
{"text":"My first drive-thru experience here wasn't great as most of the food I ordered for my husband and I was cold.  HOWEVER, after using the Wendy's Canada website to express my concerns, I was contacted by the Maple store manager to discuss my experience.  He called me within 24 hours of my complaint, listened to me, and offered free combos to my hubby and I for our next visit.   When we went into the restaurant to check it out again, the other manager working already knew who we were and gave us our food on the house as promised.  He was extremely kind and asked us to let him know if everything was ok.  The food this time was fantastic!   I was SO impressed with the way this location handled my concerns, that they have made a big fan.  Great job guys, and thank you again! :)"}
{"text":"Every time I go here my burgers are swimming in grease. You unwrap the paper and theres a pool of it. Gross! This was my second time here. I figured I'd give them another shot. Nope. Same thing. 2 stars for the Frosty. That's it."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.   Pretty much every time that I have stopped by in complete desperation of hunger, I am even more disappointed and ripped off than I ever thought I could possibly be.   Last week after forgetting half of my order (which I didn't realize until getting home (my own fault admittedly)), however, I promptly scoured the bag looking for the receipt so that I could 1) verify that my order was correct (even though I know it was given how much I paid) and 2) get the order number/phone number to call and let them know their mistake. After no avail I had to get online to find the number -- calling -- no answer. I should have expected this, they don't care about customers here.   Then my wife calls the Wendy's corporate line -- in a surprisingly quick amount of time she talks to an actual human that apologizes for the mistake and says that a \"case is opened\" and the manager from this Lawrenceville location would be getting in contact with us.   Yeah, that never happened.   Screw this place.   This Wendy's has made my wife and I stop going to other Wendy's -- that is sad."}
{"text":"Large Chili price for Small Chili I get it. Fill it up to about 75% and you're saving yourself a bunch. Even if I ask them to fill it to the top, they don't. And this leads me to believe that the employees are just doing what they are told but large means large!"}
{"text":"Very bad place,the service is worst and the place looks dirty.   Never will stop here again.       = ["}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. Take your money and go elsewhere because the employees or managers don't care when they're in the wrong(which seems to be A LOT of the time) the food is crap and don't even get me started on the wait time.."}
{"text":"Typical, usually tasty, Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers food.  BUT!  The last 7 times I have come to this particular restaurant, they have managed to screw up my order in some manner; drive-through or walk-in. Just make sure that you have a bit of extra time to make sure that your food is as you ordered it.  Also, if you go inside to make sure your food is correct as you ordered it, especially if you want to change anything, make sure you have some time.  I have, in these last 7 instances, not made it out of here in less than 7 minutes AFTER my food was ordered.  And Oh my goodness if there is a long line. Just turn around and find another place."}
{"text":"Sometimes there is nothing like a nice Wendys burger.  I used to live a few miles from this location and thought I had to give them a good  review.  I work late so I used to stop by here around 11pm a few times each month.  The workers were always exteremly nice and the service was right on.  Any issues with the food and they would be happy to replace it.  I love the old school style and the woodwork on the inside.  A+ from me!"}
{"text":"They always seem to never get my order right! Wait in line for so long to get my order wrongNot a fast food person and this is the reason why, I hate having to tolerate situations like this!!!!"}
{"text":"For the most part food is usually on point. They seem to usually have fresh fries! And the staff is usually friendly."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today and was surprised to find a chicken bone in our crispy chicken sandwich! The worst part is that we mentioned it to an employee to let manager know and no one ever came out to talk to us about what happened. Disappointing to see lack of service and scary to know what could have happened if it was a child that could have choked on the bone since it was so big! We will never go back here after the lack of attention to the matter!"}
{"text":"WORST WENDY'S EVER. We were in a rush to get out of town and decided to drive thru this Wendy's. Bad mistake. After ordering in the drive thru the guy asked us to repeat the order. Ok. No big deal. Most intercoms suck. Once we drove around to the window, he took our payment, and didn't say anything. Ok, odd, maybe he just doesn't like talking or thanking people for their business, just texting on his phone. Then he hands me a bag. Again, no communication to us - only to who he's texting. He just stood there texting like we weren't there. We noticed a tea missing from our order. After repeating twice that a drink was missing, he finally stopped texting and disappeared to the back of the restaurant for several minutes. Finally he showed up with the drink, and again didn't say anything but went back to his texting. No apology. No words spoken. Rude employees who don't pay attention to customers at this Wendy's. I'll never go back there. Yelp wouldn't let me post this without giving it at least a star. This place doesn't deserve a gold star from the dollar store."}

{"text":"I don't understand how so many people work here without actually doing any work. The line is often wrapped around the building and no one seems to have any interest in doing their job. Don't waste your time coming here. It's a headache everything and there's nothing \"fast\" about it. I'm not sure who manages this location but it's not up to par."}
{"text":"They keep fucking up my order every time I come here. What they need to do is fire everyone in this location and hire new staff with PROPER training, or go completely automated. We have the technology to make this happen. We NEED this to happen to this location, because everyone that currently works there is a monkey with low to no brains at all. Literally a monkey can do their job, AND be better at it. They have no excuse to how bad their service is, and why they continue to mess up people's orders. They're trained for a reason, and if you can't do your job properly, you might as well not have a job. just saying."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. Besides the food being totally awful, the 'manager' on duty was rude to every employee working.  The cashier (Almaz) was very nice, and pleasant. Immediately after I placed my order, the manager yelled to her 'dont take any more orders and go take lunch'.  Then the phone rang, and the manager answered it 'Mike, i've got a line and cant talk' and promptly hung up.  Now, they appeared to have a new employee working the other register. After the rude manager gave me my order, he went over and pulled a basket of fries out of the fryer. I was trying to get their attention to get some ketchup and she proceeded to yell at him for pulling the fries and then told him to help me. She then proceded to pull the fries out of the 'serve bin' and dump them back into the fryer.  One customer (as i was walking away) made a comment to the manager \"perhaps if you were a little nicer to them they'd listen better\" (referring to how she was treating the  employees).  It would have been nice if they provided salt/ketchup without having to ask - but the point is moot as I will NEVER go to this location again. I'll eat at the pizza place next door or the Paradise bakery down the hall. I have never tried them, but they have to be more professional and have better food.  STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Incompetent, unprofessional and lacks the brain power to accomplish medial tasks like assembling a sammich with the correct components.   Messed up out orders (my crew and myself) on more than one occasion.  When food was missing and I called they said \"oh, I remember your order, we didn't ring up yo chi k n San itch is\" .   So ok great you didn't complete your tasks so now we have to go all the way back up and get our food we ordered.  My recommendation is to go to the hotdog stand next to Wendy's.   I am disappointed by this experience, my guys are saddened and Charlie Murphy is pissed."}
{"text":"It's Wendy's. I didn't walk in expecting French cuisine or a five star restaurant experience. If the food had been freshly prepared it would have been a good Wendy's meal, and I would have given it five stars---for being my favorite fast food, done well. Unfortunately, I ordered the four for four. It's a helluva deal; junior bacon cheeseburger, small fries, four piece nuggets and a drink. First the good. One half of my four by four was flawless! The nuggets were warm, and crispy, and the mix your own drink setup they have is great and allowed me to have a raspberry coke! The rest of the meal was atrocious. The fries were not just verging on cold. They were dry, flavorless, and hard. The junior bacon cheeseburger, that little tight  wrapped bundle of all the perfect burger trappings for so cheap was bound together with a foot long dark hair. The hair was matter on the top of the nun but then inextricably wove its way between the burger patty and the toppings and then back around under the bottom. To their credit I asked for a replacement for the burger and they provided it. Corporate fast food is biologically and psychologically constructed to taste great, and it can if its done well. This Wendy's failed."}
{"text":"Decided to go through the drive-thru. Was  only 1 of 2 cars in line. Ordered, drove up and paid. Was asked to please pull forward so they could cook the fries. It was between 630-7 pm, not sure why they wouldn't have French fries already prepared. Whatever. I pulled up to wait.  Literally 10 minutes have passed and have not received my food. I went to drive-thru to avoid getting out of my car. So I called and they informed me they must have forgotten about me. I'm sorry, a free frosty is not going to save my order. Horrible customer service, will not be going to this Wendy's ever again!"}
{"text":"Nicest Wendy's I been to in Las Vegas. It's always clean and kept up. Customer service is superior and everything I order is great."}
{"text":"Roughly half the time my order gets screwed up. I'm sticking to Burger King."}
{"text":"Aye at Wendy's and the service was fast and very friendly. The fries tasted fresh. Overall gods job BUT I can't give them five stars cause they don't have the pretzel bun and they were out of baked potatoes."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location!  The staff is very slow and rude.  Wendy's as a chain is great, but this location puts them to shame!  Someone in front of me asked if a staff member could come out and wipe the table... And you could hear the young boy in the background commenting there's 30 tables out there she can't find a clean one!  Whenever I went to sit down and eat there really were not any clean tables, I had to go to the restroom and use wet toilet paper to wipe down a table.  The Manager on Duty was very slow and couldn't handle her own job!  What a disgrace!  I am absolutely disgusted"}
{"text":"Been disappointed too many  times, 15 minute waits, wrong orders and missing items from the drive thru, and last time I went inside I had my Frosty served to me with a scowl by someone whom looked like I wouldn't even want to shake hands with. I didn't even want to drink it, worried something else might have been added. If people don't want to work there they should just stay home."}
{"text":"Much nicer since the old one burned down and was replaced.  Typical Wendy's, fast &  hot."}
{"text":"food items, such as the broccoli and cheese baked potato, are not actually sold at the store, but can still be found on their online menu, so that was disappointing. Also, the young woman at the first window had no customer service at all. Actually, she looked rather spiteful. Anyway, I didn't receive a receipt. Usually, that minor flaw isn't a big ordeal, until I got to the second window and was handed my food. (I should have known better. No one read back my order, no one gave me a receipt, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN!) anyway, I drive forward check the quality of my mom's hamburger, and then leave. Not until i get home do i realize that they forgot the baked  potato. (Mind you it was just a regular one because the menu isn't up-to-date). Anyway, I am very disappointed in the quality of service. Had there been more quality in the workers, I think my order would have been correct and i might have had the energy to go back and get my potato!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is no luxury dining experience in any case, but this one is exceptionally bad.  The ketchup dispensers are broken, but the staff doesn't care.  The cashier used more obscenities than I would like my six year old to hear.  The dining area was dirty.   Worn paint and damaged seating everywhere.  The bathrooms have a gas station feel to them.  The food is low quality, even by Wendy's low standards.    If you must eat here, get it drive through and keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"Rude employee's. Tried to go through drive thru and the person the the speaker said they where changing the register and we would have to come in. When we declined to come in he sighed and go attitude with us."}
{"text":"Took my grandkids to pick up food at this wendys, no 9ne in drive thru, I ordered 5 mefium fries and items off value menu! Was ask to pull forward because fries were not up yet. I watched cars get their food and drive off. After 10 minutes, went in 2 others in l8ne. I moved to front of counter, was ask what I neefed, my order of 30.00 I have been waiting 10 minutes for, my bags were sitting on counter by fryer, I ask my frys and food are hot right, she assured me yes. All food was cold, frys old. That is the worst service and food, will go elsewhere. Btw it was 1:158 when I ordered, not even lunch rush, and the manager walked the other way. Poor staffing."}
{"text":"This location is the starting and end point for the Toronto Bike Network's Saturday rides, about every second Saturday, from APR to SEP. The food is good, if you like cheeseburgers. If you want a coffee, it is usually faster to go to the Wendy's section, rather than the Tim Hortons section. I like the 3/4 lb Baconator. I'm cyclist, so I need these calories or I'll waste away. ;-)"}
{"text":"This is hands down the most PAINFULLY slow drive thru. In the world. Every time I visit this location there is only 3 or 4 cars in line and it always takes 15-20 mins to get through the line. We've been here multiple times and been the only car in line and still they somehow manage to take just as long. If you're gonna get fast food, save yourself the hassle and just go to the McDonalds across the street."}
{"text":"Just today, October 4, 2014 I went through the drive through to get a pulled pork sandwich combo.  The cashier told me he had trouble swiping my card so he keyed it in and it was denied.  I told him that was impossible I had literally just used it no more than 10 minutes prior at a Walgreens and it was fine, please redo it you must have entered it wrong.  He said he couldn't it was denied.  So I said I'd go inside.  Now you'd expect when you bother to go park and go inside that the manager would at least deal with the issue, but not at this location.  The manager spent maybe 30 seconds with me said \"Oh, you're that issue\" and had the minimum wage paid cashier come over and speak with me (as he was the drive through cashier I'm sure this slowed down everyone outside in line getting their meals too....sorry guys!),  Again I asked him to retry it as the card was fine and again he said NO, I can't, the system won't allow me your card is denied.  Now I'm mortified as the lobby is full of people and you just painted me as some lowlife that cannot afford their lunch.   So I head home and immediately call the bank.  Yes, the bank showed the attempted transaction, Yes the bank denied it because THE CASHIER ENTERED THE EXPIRATION DATE WRONG.  Had either of my requests to reenter the card as they had obviously entered it wrong been honored, I could have gotten my food and been on my way.  I feel most sorry for the lowly part time employees who have to work for a manager that has no backbone.  (I would have said he had a small or nonexistent body part but kids may read this and you all know what I meant anyway).  I have already filed a formal complaint with Wendy's Headquarters and will NEVER set foot in this location again."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever!  I live like 6 blocks away.  Every time I've gone here, over several years, they've gotten my order wrong. After not going there for about a year, I decided to try getting an iced mocha.  They got that wrong too..and that was the only thing I ordered and I was the only drive thru customer.  Also, the cashier tried to send me off after I paid but before remembering she hadn't even given me my drink..WTF! What a bunch of F-tards!  Wish I could give them zero stars.  Really wish they could get their act together considering how close they are; but won't give them any more money.  They used to be open for breakfast but no longer..only lunch and dinner.  Probably because they suck! Oh and when they were open for breakfast, half the time I would get a panini, the tomatoes would be missing! I remember when they remodeled, I gave them another chance because I figured maybe they finally got rid of the dead wood...and they did, but somehow managed to get more lazy, dumb ass dufuses..this is not an employee issue..this is a management issue.  They simply don't care if they put themselves out of a job.  LOL just went there today 1/7/15 because I was on lunch while working from home and ordered the son of the baconator.  There was one piece of bacon on it.  Oh why did I bother?"}
{"text":"My Mom and I went to grab a quick lunch here, and we got our food in normal fast food timing. I forgot they switched to sweet pickles which I hate so I had to pick off my extra pickle order. But I noticed a man dressed like a manager, mopping the front area. I loved to see this manager working, its refreshing to see because you know he doesn't ask his employees to do anything he's not willing to do. Then another employee wanted to keep everyone safe, so he announced the wet floor. Loved feeling cared for, and I didn't doubt the same care went into my food! Thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"ummmm.... the baconator might be the best fast food burger ever made."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service.  Tremendously long wait. Three cars took over 15  minutes in drive through.  Each car waited 5minutes to order.  I thought they were ordering a bunch of burgers but when it was my turn to wait it also took 5 minutes.  Poor people stuck behind me.  There goes their entire lunch break.  No quick burger run here.  Drive a little bit further and get done quicker."}
{"text":"Slowest Wendy's in the history of Wendy's. It's so close to my house and easy to get to but literally the worst customer service around. I refuse to go there anymore because I will be in the drive thru for a minimum of twenty minutes. Be warned."}
{"text":"Good Wendy's location, fast friendly service, fresh food.  It's Wendy's, not gourmet food."}
{"text":"Highly consistent. There have been a few times where I was disappointed in the service or the food quality but more often then not I am highly satisfied with the wait time, the quality of the food, and how polite the staff are to me. Gerry is one of the managers and he is always polite and usually says hello. It's nice as I don't expect that for a fast food joint.  I do agree that the parking lot sucks but...I would rather eat at a place that is clean and the workers don't handle food if they handle the cash and I see the workers wearing gloves that handle food. That is more important to me than the parking lot"}
{"text":"The chili was barely warm.  The coffee was cold.  They did give me 2 packs of saletines and 2 packs of hot chili seasoning and ample napkins.  The drive through clerk was great and friendly.  The first window teller didn't say a total so good thing I remembered.  Second window employee was very friendly.  You guys can do better I know you can.  But thanks for my meal tonight."}
{"text":"One of the nicest Wendy's I've ever been to. I can't believe they have a fireplace inside here. It seems classier than fast food. They're drive through window is plenty big too. Food is good. Some things a little pricier than I thought but they're value menu is still great."}
{"text":"I was told to try this Wendys from a friend and decided to go check it out. I was greeted by a very pale skinny white boy who was very polite towards me. I was impressed by his performance and even more so by his lovely voice. As I watched him flip patties, I imagined a life together with him and have even have a name planned for our first child. He even did a little spin as he handed me my bag, winked, and gave me finger guns. I let him keep the change."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I hadn't been to a Wendy's in like, 5 years, and they've completely changed. They used to be fast food places where you walked through the amusement park poles, back and forth, then ordered at the counter and then waited a few steps away, and then the place was basically a shit hole. This Wendy's is completely different. This is seriously the future.  First off, this is probably the most modern building I have ever been in. It's super classy. Like, when I was standing and waiting to order, I felt like I was trashing the place up. People were trying to enjoy their meals and there I was standing around like an idiot because I wasn't even sure if it was a fast food place anymore or if I was supposed to sit down. Anyway I did figure it out because I'm actually pretty smart, and after I ordered, they had this big tv screen that has your name on it, and tells you when your order is up or something like that. It was so incredible I actually don't think I figured out exactly what it was for, because they just give you your food when they're done with it, so there's really not anything else you need to know, but anyway. It's great.  As for the food, I've always found Wendy's to be consistent and delicious, as long as you don't order chicken, and this place is no different. It was great. One of the best times I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Slowest service, staff doesn't think, generally rude. Would have saved more time going to one farther away. Dirty behind the counter and food handling mistakes (no gloves touching people's food). Probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"Has it come to reviewing fast food joints? This is more of a public service announcement.  I wish I had the email that I wrote to Wendy's about my visit here. Yes, I wrote a letter, I'm that guy. Alas, gone into cyberspace.  Anywho, it went a little something like this. I stopped on the way to the theatre, to grab a bite. There was no one in line, no one in the restaurant and maybe a couple of cars in the drive thru. The restaurant didn't seem all that clean, there was a lot of detritus in the food prep area, but nothing overly repellent. That is until the cashier finally sauntered over after I'd been waiting a few minutes. Sauntered, no rush. You know that body odor smell? That's not good when you're ordering food. Personal hygiene wasn't on the menu that night!! I ordered. After a few more minutes of waiting and my perception of discord in the kitchen and general apathy toward accomplishing anything, I decided I just wanted to leave. The whole experience just left me with the uneasy feeling that I didn't want to put anything from here into my mouth. I asked for my money back and left. So after roughly 10 minutes (with not another customer in the restaurant), I walked away empty-handed. I did make the movie though!  Post script: The owner and/or general manager, Dennis, sent me an email asking me to call him to talk about the issue. I called him, he told me the matter would be \"dealt with.\" Fantastic. I'm still never setting foot in there ever again. It was the kind of phone conversation where your Mom (Wendy's Corporate) makes you (Dennis) apologize for something, but you really don't actually apologize because you're not sorry because he's a stupid doo doo head."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. This is THE worst Wendys I have ever been to. The employees here suck! They have the worse attitudes. And when you say something about your order being messed up, they get mad! Like really?! You messed up my order and you have the attitude? Unbelievable! I will be calling corporate because I have never been completely disrespected as s customer. Save your time and money and do not go here! I know I won't!"}
{"text":"Keep driving....Don't stop... Awful food and horrible service.... Wendy's Corporate should shut them down!!!  Dave would be so sad if he knew."}
{"text":"I used to swing by the drive thru on my way home since we generally love Wendy's and this location we used to have good luck with. I ordered two spicy chicken sandwiches, and then a grilled chicken sandwich. They completely messed up two of the sandwiches, I ordered extra cheese, and was charged for it, but after I got home we did not actually get the cheese. We were very disappointing, and now will be second guessing giving them another try."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places to eat. Have to agree with everyone as far as the speed of the drive thru.  Went inside this time for takeout and it was much faster."}
{"text":"Love Wendy's.... I so wish this Wendy's were a five star, but right now I would settle for incremental improvements.  The Manager chastizes the staff in front of the customer, orders are filled incorrectly, and there is never an apology.  Hopefully the ownership will make the necessary improvements and I can look forward to coming here"}
{"text":"just a reminder when you order it at 1927 Uxbridge DR N W Calgary location you can only order it exactly as it is no changes the cook does not like that and will voice her displeasure so everyone can hear it and if you try to complain to head office or the manager or even district manager nothing will be done . they wont even offer you a free frosty for your trouble.  So Wendy's does nothing about customers complaints so if you are ever at the 1927 Uxbridge DR N.W Calgary location and you hear a snide comment from the cook call them out on it loud enough for everyone in the place to hear cause you darn well know the manager is not going to do anything about it so feel free to call out her as well. added bonus don't ever expect hot fries the staff are not smart enough to realize that you do not put the fries in the bag while the burger is cooking but again smarts and customer service are not a big priority for Wendy's . I feel real bad for Dave Thomas because this is not the Wendy's he used to run"}
{"text":"It's not a bad Wendy's compared to ither locations. Friendly service, decent food. However, I'm sick and tired of having to request ketchup from these penny pinching scumbag fast food chains. I ordered French fries. I shouldn't have to ask for god damned ketchup."}
{"text":"Omg.  This is definitely not a fast food restaurant in terms of the wait.  Waited minimum for over half an hour on the drive thru to get the food.   This is ridiculous.   This is around midnight."}
{"text":"Bad and old food. The service has gone down in the past 6 months and it's almost better to just go to a sit down restaurant with their prices."}
{"text":"This Wendy's needs some serious help. I live nearby so our busy family ends up stopping here alot. Yesterday we were in a rush and stopped at the drive thru. We checked the time when we ordered because we had somewhere to be. There were 4 cars ahead of us and it took over 15 minutes and our order was wrong. 2 weeks ago we stopped in to place an order to go. It took 25 minutes. The family that ordered after us just left without their food because they were so frustrated. The Wendy's a few miles down the street is much more reliable so I think we will just stop there from now on."}
{"text":"I normally go there just for the daves single combo, which in my opinion, is the best. But, after I eat, I get a frosty, which is only 99 cents. The seating in pretty good, and the staff aren't really the brightest, but it still works. But most f the time, I see lots of parents with their kids or old couples eating there, and it's nice to see people of all ages there."}

{"text":"Wendy's use to be my favorite Burger joint when they use to make them when you ordered... The patty use to be twice the size as what they have now, maybe not twice but much bigger then now... This was the second time I have been to this particular restaurant both times through the drive through and both time's I had a burger that a dog wouldn't eat... The on I had today was dry and looked like it was made the day before... I usually check the food before I leave the parking lot  this time my wife picked the food up and when she got it home and I check it this is what I got a dried out pieace of garbage I took one bite then spit it back in the bag and put it in the garbage, there goes 4 bucks... I will never again eat at this Wendy's... So if you go through the drive through I suggest you check your food before you leave..."}
{"text":"It's a brand new Wendy's, so everything was fresh and clean. Has a more modern design and decor - much more spacious than older stores. Cashier was friendly and food was hot and fast. Still can't beat the value and everyone in the family loves the variety."}
{"text":"The cashier, Jessica, was great. I enjoyed my food. She checked on me & others frequently. And kept a great dining area."}
{"text":"It is hard to give fast food a three star rating but I have never experienced such good service. The order taker actually came out and asked if we were satisfied with our food. He came out a second time and asked if we would like him to take our tray and other trash. This from a place we have eaten at over the years and which had had significant issues with staffing. The food was typical fast food, but it was freshly cooked so the crispy chicken sandwich was actually crispy and hot as were the fries. Baked potato was excellent"}
{"text":"Yay, our first time at the Madison Square Wendy's for the 4 July holiday weekend and it didn't disappoint. Super food, service and atmosphere in the open air. Perfect for a summer's evening in the City."}
{"text":"The food here is what I'd expect from a Wendy's, but don't go into the dining room if you're in a hurry. They obviously give the drive-thru top priority and you can wait upwards of 15 minutes for your food. The dining room was clean and the people were friendly. I'll go back, but I'll be staying in my car."}
{"text":"Pros: it's fast, it's pretty cheap, frostys are yummy.   Cons: fries taste like oil.  At my last visit (Jan 2016), the employee working the register seemed more interested in making conversation than helping customers. Small talk is fine, but when you're spending two minutes telling me about the tattoo you're going to get when there's a line behind me, that's not good. When he finally stopped talking to me and assisted the guy behind me, he exclaimed, \"You come in here a lot!\" while the guy was in the middle of his order.  That same day, there was another worker (a middle-aged man, I assumed was a manager but I hope not) who didn't seem to be helping customers or the cooks. Just hanging out behind the counter. He continuously was talking very loudly - not only yelling for people across the restaurant, but purposely making sure his conversations could be heard by every customer and worker. Completely obnoxious and unprofessional."}
{"text":"It had been a while since we came to this Wendy's location due to poor service in the past. My son wanted Wendy's so reluctantly we came here again.  We were as clear as we could be with our order and it still got messed up. I said large and it was rung up small. My wife clearly said strawberry lemonade and it was rung up as a soda, then they wanted me to pay the upgrade for the lemonade. I refused and said \"Thank you for solidifying that we will not return.\". Go up the road to Dale Earnhardt Blvd or Cannon Blvd. More efficient staff and fresher burgers."}
{"text":"Despite other reviews, I've had good experiences. Recently they were very busy durin lunch rush and I was seated and eating promptly. Although they forgot 1 item I asked for, they immediately whipped it up for no charge. The manager was on top of his front end staff the whole time ensuring customers' orders were served quickly and accurately."}
{"text":"We went to this Wendys today.  I ordered 2 iced tea.  The iced teas came with NO ice. I do not understand why this happens all the time. What part of ICE TEA don't people understand ?"}
{"text":"I'm only giving one star because I have to. I Found a pen in my salad. When I called to complain the  person on the phone laughed and offered me another salad... really??? I went back to the restaurant to speak to the manager and he thought it was funny too. Horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. The staff is completely rude.. I stopped by there with my family before work to get us all lunch, we run a mom and pop shop, and when we get their our order is completely messed up. We ordered two of the 4 for 4 chicken blt and a value fry. They charged us for the expensive lemonade, hand squeezed, when we just asked for lemonade. The chicken blt's didn't have bacon or tomatoes... that's part of the name, Bacon Lettuce Tomato Chicken Sandwich. So we call the number on the recept to get it fixed and it's not even the number to their location. So Jose from the location off of Warner in Tempe listens to what this location did and puts the request in for us to get this meal fixed for free, the two blt chicken sandwiches fixed. Well today we go to get those sandwiches, both of us are hungry and the manager there is rude and unaccomidating. He tells us that he can fix one of the orders or don't take that and leave. Who does that?! Completely rude customer service and they don't care for their customers and I don't care for them. I hope this location gets less business for their shitty way of treating customers. I won't ever do business here ever again."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food, Wendy's has always had better quality food. Whether it be any healthier, that's a different story.   However, when it comes to customer service with Wendy's, it's usually a hit or miss. This one in particular has service that rivals Chicik-Fil-A. Every time I come in, I get friendly greetings from the staff and the manager personally ensures that your order is complete and full.   5 stars for a Wendy's:)"}

{"text":"Their slow af everytime I go to the drive thru they always make me wait 5-15 mins just for my burgers"}
{"text":"I will have to agree with other fellow yelpers. This place needs its cogs and wheels adjusted. The employees just don't have it together and several of my coworkers have witnessed them fighting and even talking back to customers. The food is ok- once you finally get it. The frosties are usually good- only had one that tasted sour.  I do enjoy the Dave's hot and juicy burgers. There is an older lady who works there who is good- Not sure how she puts up with the others though."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 spicy chicken sandwiches, 2 fries, and an order of spicy chicken nuggets. The sandwiches were still nice and hot when we got home and they were great. The fries were ok they could have been more fresh. The nuggets were great and hot. Overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"I just ordered a chili baked potato, they just gave me the baked potato no chili, and not a fork to eat it. I tried twice to call them no answer."}
{"text":"The staff at this Wendy's are usually all clustered around the drive thru window chatting while one cashier deals with a line of 10 people. It's not even like they're discrete. You can see them all from the line you're waiting in. The other till? It sits empty. When you finally get your meal, it's not bad, though you have to remember that if there are more than 2 people in front of you, you're waiting for ten minutes before being served. The bathrooms are kinda gross too, but they're shared with the Tim Hortons. The place is always filled with kids (16 year olds) who stand in the parking lot looking at their Honda Civics or clustering around tables loudly shouting about nothing in particular, especially late at night. Either way, it's just Wendy's. At least the fries aren't stone cold like the location on Lawrence Av at Ralph Street in Weston."}
{"text":"Just left this location after waiting 15 minutes in line. It was 7:30 at night so I figured a dinner rush. I waited at the window to get my food much longer than usual, to get home and notice a soggy bun and when I bit into the burger it is raw. See the pictures. Disgusting and unsafe!"}
{"text":"The only good news I can share on this place is I love the spicy chicken sandwich and it's nearly impossible to mess it up. Most everything else though, blah! The fries were barely warm. The drink machine with all the different drinks was missing more flavors than it had. I like Vanilla Coke, no vanilla. I'll settle for cherry. No cherry. You can sense when a location has pride in itself. This place did not."}
{"text":"Don't go there after the lobby closes. All of the chicken, beef, potatoes, and chili gets moved over to the heat lamps in the fry station and sits there till close. They do not use the freshness timers and food is served long after expired. The store manager Rico thins a free frosty will fix all customer issues and refuses to give refunds. They do not follow Wendy's standards and the store is a dirty mess. The workers all have painted fake fingernails which is against food safety standards. I worked there for a few weeks and left because of their unsavory business practices. I hope they get shut down soon. Disgusting!!!!"}
{"text":"Usually stop by at least twice a week and last couple of times been an issue. Frosty no spoon, drink with combo no straw. I understand save where you can, but give me accessory to enjoy my meal.   Today got wrong order totally had to make u-turn to get correct order and refunded difference.   Hopefully with some extra training they will listen to customer reviews"}
{"text":"Drive thru staff tonight was terrible. Was not given the correct order and was given incorrect change.  Staff showed zero personality. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto. Ignorant & arrogant thugs. Went inside to have them correct my order from the drive-thru (give me what I paid for- forgotten 20 piece chicken nuggets), to be followed by 7 staff members (including the \"manager, \"Kathy\") physically threaten me in the parking lot, allow her 6 staff (and 2 teenage loiters/customers) to verbally and physically threaten me, and threaten to call the police on ME. I have it all on video...eat/dine at your own risk."}
{"text":"Bathroom was dirty. Dining room tables needed to be wiped and trash removed. Carpet was dirty. Service was good. Food was good but we will not be back. Too bad, too, as this is the only Wendy's in the area.  Restaurant was freezing cold. I attributed that to a recent rain storm on a very hot day."}
{"text":"This is one of the most screwed up Wendys in Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, there is not a lot of other fast food choices in the immediate area.  They are just slow or understaffed??  People moving but in slow motion.  If you go inside, expect a wait and frustration."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Tate was very slow, kept asking the same questions. He couldnt figure how to pay with a gift card and neither could the so called manager.  It took 20mins to get our food which was cold by the time we got it. The employees were too busy socializing in the back instead of taking care of their customers. Will never go back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went through the drive thru on our last visit. They once again got my order right. Infact to be honest I don't remember them ever getting my order wrong.    On other occasions I have dinned inside of this? Wendy's. The lobby has always been very clean and inviting.   The service has been excellent. I notice the employees seem happy to be working here. I like that. I think it might be one of the reason the lobby is so clean and the accuracy in orders is so excellent. My theory is that happy employees make for a cleaner and more effectively running buissness in general. That might be the secret as to how this restaurant creates a positive experience for it's customers. The food is really good food too. It tastes fresher than a lot of other fast food I have had elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pretty regular Wendy's. Always order here, either drive thru or restaurant service is fast, orderly. Place is clean, never had a problem with my orders."}
{"text":"Always had good food here, just went in for a frosty float and the lady at the window barely spoke to me. I got my order pretty quickly considering the long line ahead of me, but no line is long enough that you can't say thank you or \"have a good evening\" to a customer."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's I've been too !!! The food comes out nasty looking, smashed, looks like it's been sitting for a while.....fries are either cold or way over salted!!! cashiers are to busy flirting with the boys that come in. Seems management doesn't care either..... Restrooms are always dirty at every visit I've been there. Last time I went.......about Sept of 2010, never going back."}
{"text":"Although the food itself was good and the restaurant appeared to be clean, the service was seriously lacking! Not a single person acknowledged my existence and I had to step up to the counter and ask if I could order. I never saw a single smile from any employee either. I guess you can't expect too much for a fast food joint, but this Wendy's could certainly step it up a notch."}
{"text":"Best fast food breakfast around!  Love the mornin' melt panini with bacon and tomato!  Their homefries are wayyyy better than those hashbrown greaseballs they have at most places....the coffee is great and service is very friendly!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this Wendy's location. I rarely eat fast food, but my boyfriend has the flu and requested a frosty and fries, so that's what I got him! If I could give this place 0 stars, I absolutely would. Customer service is everything.  I pulled into the drive-thru and waited for my turn at the speaker. When it was finally my turn, the vehicle in front of me was still slightly in the way of me getting to the speaker. I could only see half of the board with the menu items. The attendant came on, I said, \"I can't see the number, but I would like the chicken nuggets meal\". The attendant and another employee busted out laughing through the speaker and said, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" I again said, \"I cannot see the entire board, I want whatever number the chicken nuggets meal is\". The attendant said, \"so you want a number 10\"? I reply  the same way that I did the previous TWO times. Seriously, tell me my total so that I can move on from this unnecessary experience!! Finally, she gave me my total and I pulled forward.  The attendant opened the window and whatever she was eating/chewing on almost flew out of her mouth when she greeted me, and again she thought this was funny. The sad part is that this attendant appeared to be \"in charge\". I was absolutely disgusted.  Like mentioned, this was my first experience, and certainly my last. This Wendy's location manager should be thankful that it's in a very busy spot. If not, the location would be closed down."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional crew! While placing my order, all I could hear in the back were people yelling and cussing at each other!"}
{"text":"Food was hot, tasted great, place was clean. But when I have to hear an employee purposely talk down to and embarrass a new employee right in front of me...that's what makes me give this place only 3 stars. Be nice to the people you work with, you have to see them every day. Your supposed to be a team and when your not being a team, that's when things like customer service, speed, and the feel of the place looses it's 5 stars."}
{"text":"I live down the street and have gone here numerous times and each time is utterly poor. No matter if you're getting it through the drive through or inside, the employees always (and I am not exaggerating here) mess up an order if you've made any change to it (I.e. No tomato, no cheese, etc.). Even when the receipt says your correct order the food itself is incorrect. Beyond irritating, definitely not going here again."}
{"text":"If I could give this Wendy's location a zero star rating, I would. This is the nearest Wendy's to my home so I'm forced to go there when I have a craving for Wendy's food. Sadly, each and every time my boyfriend and I go to this location, we have a terrible experience. Last night, we ran to Wendy's for a late dinner (9:15pm). We used the drive-thru, and pulled around to order. We noticed that there was nobody inside to take out order, as we looked around we saw the entire night staff outside, some smoking, some just hanging out talking. We waited as the drive-thru attendant finished her cigarette, and slowly walked back into the building. Our order was finally taken, once we get to the pick up window, the bag of food was thrown at us and didn't even have all of the items that we ordered inside. We pulled around to the main entrance of the store to ask for the missing item, and was rudely told that they were sure they put every item in the bag. An argument started, with the \"manager\" insisting that we were the ones in the wrong! From now on, we will drive out of our way to another Wendy's. Avoid this location at night at all costs!"}
{"text":"Service for breakfast is always great. Very courteous staff. Always clean and maintained."}
{"text":"If you've eaten at one Wendy's, you've eat at all Wendy's.  It's all the same.   What differentiates one Wendy's restaurant from the others is the service.  And the service and overall experience at the Bethel Park store is so ridiculously bad, it's almost comical.   If you didn't know better, you'd think it was done on purpose so they could capture the reactions of patrons on a closed circuit camera and upload it for a TV show.     No matter when you go, no matter if it's drive through or going inside, they manage to screw up the order.   In fact, of all the restaurants on Rt. 88 in Bethel Park, I challenge you to find one other restaurant which offers worse service.  Seriously, take me up on this Pepsi challenge.   I'll give you an example.   We were there this past Saturday around 12:30 p.m. (lunch time).  The Saturday lunch rush is THE busiest time for all fast food restaurants.   Inside, they had ONE register open - and nobody helping out the lone employee working the register.   There was 4 people in front of us, and it took them 35 minutes for us to get a simple order.     When you call to complain - even going so far as to speak to the regional manager, it's abundantly clear that they couldn't care less.   Customer satisfaction is absolutely not on their radar.  They can't be bothered to sufficiently staff the place so there are enough people to cover point of sale transactions."}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because you can't give less. As I waited for a long time at the drive through window for a few Frosty's that I ordered, we saw an employee who was pouring the Frosty's lick one, put the lid on and place it on the drive through counter to be served to us. It took a good five minutes for the drive through employee to even open the window for us to tell her about it. She had no reaction, but an eye roll and did nothing. We drove away and tried calling the restaurant. I asked for a manager and a young man said that he was the manager. As I began to explain the issue, a girl got on the phone and she claimed to be the manager and she admitted that she was also the employee who licked the Frosty. She said that it was her Frosty and was not polite about it at all. I told her that I saw her try to serve it to us and that was not true, and she only replied with \"Where do you expect to go with this?\" I do not believe that she was the manager and she was very rude. My family and I were completely disgusted by her unsanitary behavior and this is not the first time that we have encountered rude employees at this location. We will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"The workers here are very friendly! Fast service and very clean! Didn't wait long and I had a good experience here."}
{"text":"Pulled up to the drive thru. They asked me what i would like to order.  I asked for a moment and it went silent. I said \" hello?\" Because i wasnt sure she heard me. She asked if i was ready to order i said \"oh,no, i just wasnt sure you heard me.\" Typically the response you hear is \"sure take your time.\" Or \"let me know when your ready.\" Anyway, so i went to the window where this asian lady said \"hi, (price). I handed over my card and the Hispanic lady behind her was smiling. Not sure if she was amused at my response or she was being polite.  So i told the Asian lady \"was that you that took my order?\" She said \"yes\" i replied \"oh next time you should say something because i wasnt sure you heard me and it just went silent.\" She said \"oh, sorry.\"  rolling her eyes. Now, i wasnt complaining, i was just trying to give her feed back on how it is to be listening at the drive thru. I wasnt being a jerk. The Hispanic lady then came to the window and handed me the food. I asked if that was her manager she said yes. I said \"with that kind of attitude. Really? I feel bad for you\" And the Hispanic lady then said \"have a good niiiight\". Now, dont get me wrong the food was pretty good considering i have never liked Wendys. The service, was horrible.  Im in customer service and i get the fact that its hard to be upbeat and postive 100% of the time or take your time with each customer, when your waiting on the clock but her response clearly shows she doesnt belong as a manager."}
{"text":"Stood in line for five minutes without even being acknowledged. Even after employees looked at us they still chose to not take our order. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"I only put one star because you have to. I had the worst customer service. It was a little busy so I can get that there may be some frustration. No excuse to treat your guest poorly. We are what gives you a paycheck..."}
{"text":"My most important rule: Leave the business if it smells terrible.  If it smells terrible then most likely the food is terrible. I always break my rule though because it is inconvenient to leave. I stayed and it turns out that the food was terrible. Also I think this Wendy's used to have a cockroach as the profile picture since the location was infested with cockroaches, but I think they took it off lol. Do not go here; trust me."}
{"text":"This place never gets my order right. I wish I could give 0 stars. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I had the Dave's Single combo. The ingredients definitely felt fresher than most fast food restaurants. Overall, Good food, fast service and clean place."}
{"text":"I left my wallet in the ladies' room 10 days ago. Someone turned it in to the staff. I spoke with Esau, the manager and he was absolutely wonderful. Even in the busy lunch hour, he took the time to reassure me that my wallet was in good hands and would be shipped directly to me. The very next day, Fed Ex had my wallet for me and it was completely in tact.  I am so grateful to Esau and the customer who turned my wallet in. EXCELLENT customer service."}
{"text":"Both burgers were old and hard. Fries over salted. So disappointed. It was only 630pm. We couldn't even eat half of it."}
{"text":"The service here is awful! I keep giving this location a shot and I'm not sure why I bother.. their entire staff is rude, messes up orders and never give me my receipt which worries me... I don't think I'll give them anymore business."}
{"text":"Wendy's has at least 1 really awesome employee- his name is Jay and he's usually working when we go there around 11pm. He's very friendly and just plain awesome- that's good customer service!"}
{"text":"They just redesigned the place and it looks great. Nice atmosphere, large space, bright, friendly. They also have the super rad Coca-Cola touch screen fountain pop machine with over 100 options. The new poutine is good, maybe ask for extra gravy because it is a little sparse for a Canadian classic."}
{"text":"Great place to eat ...Faster than most places ..... Clean and friendly!!! Food is good and is cook to order unlike other places that pre made their burgers. If you go for lunch or dinner they really try their best to serve you as quick as they can!"}
{"text":"Great service! Food was good. Very clean in side for it being a fast food. Employee where always smiling. It's nice to come get food and dealing with an employee that enjoys there job. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is \"freaky fast\" when I go through the drive through. It looks super clean and nice inside and they even have a little fake fireplace if your looking for the cheapest romantic date ever."}
{"text":"This location was fairly clean.   Service was pretty quick.   Cashier was fairly friendly.   I had the strawberry salad which was very good.  In short, everything was very good but not quite great."}
{"text":"This was My third time visiting this location recently. Mainly only because of convenience, but this is my last time ever. Apparently asking for no tomato on your sandwich is like asking for a kidney. My last sandwich I got, the bun was so stale I took the chicken out and the few scraps of lettuce and used the lettuce as a bun and just ate it like that. It's garbage good just like every chain, but a fresh bun and leaving a tomato off a sandwich is not asking much. Also of you go into the place, all the workers look like they are in a POW camp or something. So damn miserable. Anyways, go somewhere else and not the subway next to it, it's just as bad"}
{"text":"I went to this Wendy's today, October 5, 2014 around 2pm. I'm not sure of the time exactly because I never received a receipt. The fun started placing my order with a young girl who was working the register. It was quite clear she had no idea how to run the register as another employee had to help her with every order I witnessed. I ordered a #1 no cheese and a kid's meal for my child. After waiting about 10 minutes for the food to come out, I got a burger with cheese on it and the kids meal was missing the fries and drink. An older woman who was working the other register took back the sandwich and the younger girl who took my order first accused the other employee of incorrectly taking my order and then when she was told she took the order, she accused me or ordering it with extra cheese. (I have Crohn's disease, uh no). At that point I said, in a direct and loud manner, just give me the Burger plain, the fires and kid drink, I don't care that all of you are fighting each other over this, just get it done. Instantly my order materialized and four people waiting in line left, one yelling \"f$&k this place they can't get anything right\". Thereafter, I was delighted to find the ketchup dispensers were all empty, the garbage cans in the place were overflowing, the doors were filthy and two of the French fries in my kid's meal were frozen solid. Forget bad management being the case here, Wendy's should revoke the owner's franchise. I will never go here again. A complete an utter hole. I understand Wendy's isn't Le Bec Fin or Morton's, but there are minimum standards people...."}
{"text":"Over cooked my tenders and the color is so obvious. Yet they still dare to put them in my drive through package....."}
{"text":"Bad service! Employees and supervisor are busy gossiping instead of working. There was no one else in line either to order food or wait for food, and I still waited five minutes for the workers to notice me and take my order. Not one worker helped me so I left. I can take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Wow... Went into this restaurant hungry then when we walked in it was smelly and then we went to the bathroom to wash our hands and we realized why it smelled. There was crap all over the toilet and floor in the woman's bathroom where someone looked like they had attempted to clean up but didn't finish. Needless to say we lost our appetite and had to leave and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This wendy consistently fails, over and over and over. The people working there I swear can never get fired. I always wait in line here, there is always 1 cashier and never any more. I come here off and on because it's across the parking lot from my work. I've had a drink spilt in my lap by the drive through window and had the associate at the window just stood there and looked at me, no apology, no offers for napkins. Just don't go, avoid this place like the plague and you'll be better off."}
{"text":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! I called to get exact location of this particular Wendy's and a young girl by the name of Rebecca answered. I asked what side of the street.. north, south, etc.? Rebecca's response was. \"I don't know.\" So I replied, \"Can you ask someone?\" I heard her in the background asking someone. Rebecca comes back with, \"All I can tell you is we are in the Wal-Mart parking lot if that helps.\" I replied, \"Um no because I don't know where Wal-Mart is, I am not familiar with the area.\" Rebecca apologized and told me that they are not good with directions. I heard her ask one person! So I said to her, \"Are you telling me that every single person that works there cannot tell you which side of the street you are located and you are unable to help me?\" Rebecca replied, \"I'm sorry we don't know.\" I began to get truly upset Rebecca did not care to help me whatsoever and exclaimed, \"Are you really telling me you can't help me?!\" It gets better.... A snarky person by the name of Karen gets on the phone, I am assuming the manager, unsure how an idiot like Karen could even hold a title in management. By this time I am livid that Rebecca refused to be of any assistance and blew me off when I am trying to get to your place of business to spend money.... REALLY??? I have to fight so hard to come to an establishment to make your company money... REALLY???? Karen was no help as she said if I calm down she will tell me. JUST TELL ME YOU HORRIBLE EXCUSE OF A HUMAN BEING!!!!! I am pretty sure she was the one who told Rebecca that they were in the Wal-mart parking lot and that's all they can really say... Now you have an answer which would've avoided the whole situation to begin with? I let Karen know I will be calling corporate and her response was, \"Good and I will tell them you are being rude!\" Karen, had you provided the information requested in the first place instead of being a lazy piece of crap all would've been well. I would've made my way down there and spend the $100 (husband had a car full of soccer kids in his car behind me) at Wendy's vs. Carl's Jr. down the street. Poor customer service and I will make sure to avoid this Wendy's at all costs. Such a shame this location to give Wendy's such a poor reputation with me as I have always had great customer service at every Wendy's I have visited. I will think twice moving forward as the we got such great service from the ladies at Carl's Jr. even though there were 20 rambunctious boys with hungry bellies!!! Shame on you Karen and Rebecca! One star is giving way too much but no other choice is given on this site."}
{"text":"No stars if I could but I have to rate something so 1 star and u got lucky! this place gets my food wrong all the time. I make the drive to another one because of the horrible food quality. I got rubber chicken. It was terrible. Called and complained and was offered a free sandwich which I never went back for ick!!!!!"}
{"text":"I tried the 4 for 4 meal and the hamburger was cool, the fries were cold and only the chicken fingers were warm and good."}
{"text":"Wendy's is normally good for fast food. This store stinks!! Twice I have ordered items that they were out of. Once is oops, twice is simply poor management. What good is an Asian salad without any dressing?? The clerk was rude and didn't care less. If I had not been trapped in the drive thru I would have left without buying a anything. I will not go to this Wendy's ever again!! Next time I want Wendy's I will drive further to a different store. Most Wendy's in general are usually 3 or 4 stars. This store gets zero stars, but yelp won't let me enter zero. The one star is a gift from yelp."}
{"text":"Half way eating through the Caesar salad I felt like I was chewing on rocks.. then found peaces of dirt inside, employees need to start washing lettuce before serving"}
{"text":"It's Wendy's food. Good fast food that isn't super greasy. The spicy chicken sandwich is my favorite. The drive through is always friendly and fast. I haven't had a wrong order yet, which is a miracle at fast food places.   To get into the Wendy's is kind of a pain sometimes. Especially now when there is construction going on the main road . Plenty of parking and always clean."}
{"text":"It's late. I get it. But for someone to not even say a word let alone look at you is just pathetic. No \"thank you\" no \"have a good night\" nothing. Just an eye roll and attitude. I don't expect much when it comes to fast food. But seriously this is pathetic."}
{"text":"So much drama behind the counter. The mgr was apparently screwing every order, not letting the multiple staff do their job.  Store was barely 1/2 populated.. 22 min top get served. Sandwich made me wish I had gone somewhere else with every bite.....bum not fresh....meat cold and dry..... One star b/c store appeared clean. Zero star for bad service and product.    Love Wendy's...never here again......"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever for being close to the strip this Wendy's sucks ass the had me wait for fresh fries and once I got my order fried were soaked in oil, and my burger was far beyond well done. Discussing never going back and not even a bother to complain if it's the whole store!! Nasty as Wendy's I wonder how there cooking at home is"}
{"text":"ZERO Rating!  I got burned on this Wendy's earlier this year but gave it a second chance two nights ago...ordered their new Chicken Tender deal for $5, should have saved my money!  Cold wimpy chicken and even colder fries - and tasted like they had been sitting in a batch of grease.  Fire this manager and close this location down!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you are stuck with fast food due to circumstances beyond your control, right now our family is in this situation. We have a family member who is gravely ill and we are eating a LOT of fast food in this area, I can't remember the last time that we were able to cook a meal at home.  My sweetheart's dad is having serious issues swallowing and is having to drink thicken liquids at this point. Our research recommends Wendy's shakes for patients with this issue as the shakes apparently contain some ingredients that cause that cause them to melt slower.  For this reason we have been buying him lot's of Wendy's shakes. That is the good news. The bad news is that this is the closest Wendy's to where he is at and the service is consistently awful.   Usually a fast food restaurant tends to put their best server on the drive-thru. I really, really hope that this is not the case. We've had the same server several times and she is consistently rude. The order is wrong about half of the time, and even the change given is consistently incorrect.  I've approached the managers on duty more than once and gotten the impression that they consider rudeness, wrong orders and wrong change just standard fast food business practice. The next day the same employee is in the window being rude and getting orders and change wrong.  The place is run down looking from the outside. There are two drive up windows. The first one is out of service and has been for a while. That's not a big deal. There is a sign in the window telling you to move to the next window. The sign is half falling down and faded. It's been in that condition for a long time. It is obvious that the management hasn't bothered to look at the outside of the building for a while. I'm honestly afraid to go inside as I don't want to know just how bad it is.  I purposely chose to review this restaurant as it is the worst example of fast food service in this area. I also reviewed the Taco Bell down the street as they always seem to do it exactly right.   Avoid this place if you can. Every other fast food location on route 50 is better, some of them are way better. Vote with your wallet."}
{"text":"Place is constantly rammed and its really loud!! Good luck getting a seat. I'm not a fan of Wendy's but occasionally when I wanted a salad, their spicy chicken Cesar salad was quite good, despite seeing the staff on numerous occasions take the cheese out of the bin WITHOUT gloves/or washing their hands and sprinkle it on my salad.. Yikes  Keep in mind this place isn't a 5 star restaurant and I know this, but up-keeping the bathrooms really isn't hard. The bathrooms are literally the most disgusting saddest rooms I've ever seen lol toilet paper everywhere and lots of... waste on the floors because I guess you can't just aim in the toilet.   This is mostly a 'hangout' for locals and a pit stop for most driving by, not a nice place to enjoy your lunch.."}
{"text":"Ordered the pretzel bacon cheeseburger for the first time andddd it had no bacon on it! I could not take it back to the counter because I'd already waited in line forever and was on a timed lunch break. Never again"}
{"text":"Horrible service much rather drive up the street to the older wendys where the service is anazing. Here the Food takes forever employees always in a bad mood. Last time i went the manager was fighting with the drive through employee and backed up the cars really bad. The manager (a smaller petite blond haired ) didnt even apologize for making me wait 20 min while her and the other girl that worked there argued will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"I never thought id write a review for a fast food location but here it is. I love wendys but i will drive out of my way just to come to this location. All the staff is ALWAYS very happy and helpful. Im always greeted with a genuine hello and my food comes out almost right away. The managers (a latino gentleman and an older lady) know how to train their team."}
{"text":"Wendy's did not care about this customer. The fries were very brown and had a burnt taste. PIcked up my Sprite and top popped off and lost entire Spite in passenger seat..ice and all..not even a taste. Called manager and was told that the grease was old and then said it wad VERY old and wouldn't be changed till tomorow and she cannot do anything about it till her boss says so.She then said they also have faulty tops. Never offered to replace items or anything. Attitude was..that is how it is and its just my loss. Let customers know before you serve old grease and burnt fries to see if thats ok with them and warn is tops are faulty. I would have said no to Very old grease.Corporate needs to know this. ."}
{"text":"Do not go here... Make the drive to either Chapperal & Pima or Pima & Frank Lloyd Wright.  Nothing here takes good! Baked potatoes are way too burnt and mushy, plus burgers not fresh; so they are too chewy! Not enough business so everything is old and not edible!"}
{"text":"I come here often, as it is close to my house and I don't feel like cooking much during school and work. Every time I've come here, and I've come here for years, the staff is very friendly and courteous, and my food is always cooked well. They are consistent whether it's night or day, and I always get through the drive thru quickly and with my order correct, even with a long line. I recommend this location to anyone, and I will continue to come here often. It's rare to see consistently exceptional service and food. I'm glad I have a place near home that provides both."}
{"text":"Worked there they were great but the company was slow and did not clean well also made a lot of mistakes but people were sweet"}
{"text":"Ate lunch there yesterday and it was pretty gross. My partner tried the new asian boneless chicken wings and when she opened the container to eat them there were two fries in the container, gross. Why serve a baked potato with vegetable oil spread instead of real butter?"}
{"text":"Love, The nice  New look with same grate taste. & Nice too the same face's are still their... Your food is always been Fresh & Hot. :  God Bless with your success."}
{"text":"Price: 5/5 value menu is bomb diggity. 8 different items for 1.89 ranging from burgers, fries, drinks etc.  Atmosphere: 4/5 newly renovated good place to chill and have late night munchies. It's connected to Timmies.  Service: 3/5 took longer than usual to order tonight but got food pretty fast.  What we ordered: 3/5, we got 5 piece chicken nuggets  with bbq dipping sauce and small fries. Hot, taste good for fast food."}
{"text":"We ate in. The place was very clean. Everyone working had a smile on their face, and I got a power Mediterranean salad. Hands down the best fast food salad I've ever had in my life. No dressing either. My husbands burger was wonderful. He got the Daves Triple. Absolutely ordering that again! Oh and also, the frys were perfectly crispy."}
{"text":"Your typical Wendy's! Always fast and gets our orders right. I like that they're open later. Kind of on a busy street, be careful around lunchtime or dinnertime."}
{"text":"This Wendy's has some great staff who deliver good food, as ordered most of the time. Only had couple bad experiences in my many visits.   Issue has been corrected and has been great since.  For best experience visit before 4, staff is quicker and world's nicer."}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience. 1st off, I walk in I see someone training in the back but that's it. No one greets me or anything. I wait at the register for a good 5 or 6 min with nothing, finally someone comes out of the back looks at me, doesn't say anything just walked outside and started cleaning the windows. At this point I'm pissed, so I call the store, from inside the store at the register. Someone answeres, I asked if they were closed and she told me no. I advised her of the issue and she came up and helped us. The problem is she decided to help the few of us in line and in the drive thru at the same time before getting our drinks ready like they're supposed to after each cashout. Food was waiting on the trays for a good 2 or 3 min before we got the drinks and the ok to take the trays. Not to mention the food looks like it was thrown on the tray with Frye everywhere and my nuggets fallout out, messy looking for sure, and she wasn't even busy at all there was 3 customers in the whole place. And through all of this you see the Mgr in the back just so walking around, not even once did he come out and check on us even know owing we were ignored for the amount of time we were. I've never had such a bad fast food experience"}
{"text":"Lady with lip piercing didn't seen welcoming. She was annoyed it seemed that I was there. I had a frosty it was like most and I had a value fry which was also good! Food is good just work on the friendliness and welcoming attitude please."}
{"text":"The service was slow bad and just unfriendly don't go here. I sat for 49 minutes just waiting for my food."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Wendy's I have ever been at.  I gave it 2 stars because it is new, but it took forever to get our food and they were not busy.  After such a long wait (over 10 minutes), our fries were cold...not lukewarm but cold!!!!!  The replacement fries were Luke warm.  Definitely NOT fast food!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know why but I'm totally obsessed with Wendy's chili. when it's hot or cold...no matter if it's hot or cold outside it's always the perfect comfort food. This location is convenient because it's close to home however the staff is always changing you can literally come within one or two weeks of each visit and everyone is different. When I'm not in the mood for their tasty chili I'll settle for some nuggets with some honey mustard sauce"}
{"text":"9 out of 10 times your order is wrong through drive thru. I have been to this location five straight times and they never get the order right. If you wanted regular nuggets, they give you spicy nuggets. if you wanted no lettuce, you get lettuce. Double check your order before pulling off. Employees tend to not give the best customer service."}
{"text":"Drive through almost always gets my order wrong. The past 3 times i got the asiago chicken sandwich drive throught didnt put bacon on it!! Thats the best part too:/."}
{"text":"horrible service. this is the closest Wendy's to my house and I live Wendy's. but I rarely go there because I have terrible service every single time. the staff is terrible! I would rather drive past this location to a farther one just to avoid their crap. RUDE!"}
{"text":"No one greeted us at the drive through or was standing at either window. A clueless employee said \"Oh, her headset died, pull back to the first window and she'll take your order\". When I started honking after about 5 full minutes of sitting in front of the window finally someone said \"what the fuck are they honking for?\" And then walked away right in front of the manager who did nothing. So I drove away and went next door to McDonald's. Way better service over there."}
{"text":"Never going to this location again. My initial service was fine, my food was fine. However, three people (two of whom were in employee uniform) were smoking immediately outside one of the doors, which also happened to be about 5 feet away from the drive-thru window. I went inside to notify the manager that they can't smoke there- state law prohibits smoking within 25 feet of any door, openable window, or ventilation intake of a public establishment- and health code is even more stringent. Manager was very rude- tried to argue the law with me, then just said that the health department has been there when people have been smoking there before and it wasn't a problem. Guess who's calling the health department tomorrow?"}
{"text":"We came in to eat inside and the coke freestyle put black specks of something floating in our drinks. Very disgusting."}
{"text":"Not bad for fast food. So far everyone my boyfriend and I have encountered has been pleasant. I'm usually the passenger and can never read the menu sign because of the placement. If we are craving fast food, we usually head here."}
{"text":"Employees are in too much of a rush to pay attention...first asked for money for they incorrect order then ended up giving me the wrong order because they couldn't listen or didn't care enough to pay attention...no wonder why chains are installing the digital ordering system....they need them installed at this location"}
{"text":"Displeased over and over and over again. A couple months back, while driving through the drive thru, our car drove over a DITCH in the middle of the drive through, and damaged the rim. After calling the Wendys and being redirected multiple times eventually leading to the corporate phone number, we left a complaint. They called back with not an apology, but with the words \"Claim Denied\". After continuing to visit the Wendys as it is the only convenient location for us, they continue to screw up orders with the most recent one being forgetting dressing and croutons for a Cesar salad, leaving just lettuce. Also asked for hot sauce for my chili and just after asking I got the food to find that there's no hot sauce. I really feel I should get AT LEAST an apology, but I know even that is too much to ask from them..."}
{"text":"Got one baconator instead of two that I've asked for. Already was too far to go back. Had to repurchase another burger."}
{"text":"Usually Wendy's is a dependable visit. Each time I visit this location the wait gets longer and longer. On a positive note, they are beginning to get our orders correct!"}
{"text":"Wendy's for dinner not a bad choice it is by far the best fast food chain. The service was good and the food is what it is! I always get a chocolate frosty can't go wrong there! The jbc is the best hamburger they have on a budget!"}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would worse place to eat was given nasty cold burtn fries and a raw patty that was still practualy. Frozzen when i bit into it was all pink yuk still feel sick days after and ehen i call manger on duty she seemed to not care and had nerve to tell me there no way its cold i literally. Took it off grill i said why would i lie she then brushed off the fact that i told she gave me raw meat and said well come back so we can replace it mine you it was 11 something worse service ever !! I posted pictures of my burger to"}
{"text":"Witnessed staff accepting cash and then making food without changing gloves or washing their hands.   Completely disgusted by this.   Not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I ordered a CAROLINA BURGER. It was burnt, dry and crunchy! There is barely any slaw on it. Couldn't tell the chili from the burger dried up!  The drive thru took 20 minutes for 4 cars!  The cashier was totally uninterested.  I did not get a reciept.  Just a very poorly managed location.  Stay away you will live longer."}
{"text":"What can I say? One of the reasons I keep going here is because I know I will get what I want in less than a minute. They are by far the fastest fast food place I have ever been to IN MY WHOLE LIFE. As a creature of habit, I always get the spicy chicken combo with iced tea and you know what's nice? It always costs the same thing!!! I am making this point because as many of you know, stress prone fast food workers in the financial district sometimes charge you whatever, but not these folks! They've got it down cold.  These people have customer service flowing through their veins. Rarely have I seen such teamwork and flawless coordination between all the moving parts. They also serve what seems to be 8 people at a time even though there are only 3 cash registers. I also love how they always get my order right and DID I MENTION HOW FAST THEY ARE?"}
{"text":"Dead, nasty food every time.  I just threw away an entire order of food it was so bad and its not then first time I've done turn after ordering from this location.  This manager and franchise owner must be completely absent here."}
{"text":"Clean and fresh inside.  Staff was attentive and prompt with food service.  I liked the option to use the kiosk or a cashier.  I used the kiosk because my kids think it is cool to build their own meal.  The food came out fresh and correctly prepared.  All the self service areas (drinks, napkins, forks, etc) were full and organized.  The bathroom was clean which is also a big plus when your kids have to go every 5 mins..."}
{"text":"I like the food but often find I leave the drive through with food missing and they frequently forget to give me a receipt so I would recommend asking for one when going through the drive through to prove what you paid for. They cut you off while your ordering and then mess up your food. I find they are lazy and don't read back your order to confirm and get mad when you ask them to make sure they have everything."}
{"text":"Under the slice of very cold cheese is a very dried out overcooked miniature patty.  Staff and manager Jorge very rude.  What happened to Wendy's?  Used to have very good hamburgers well NOT anymore.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Wendy's is goat. Probably the most underrated fast food places out there. As having a friend that works there, I can tell you that the quality really is great, with none of their meats ever being frozen. I probably ordered at least 10 chicken sandwiches when their deal was on and still think their value menu is one of the best. After eating mcdonald's I usually get an upset stomach but that's never the case when I decide to grab Wendy's. I usually order 3-5 things from the value menu such as the JBC, Caesar salad, Cheeseburger, Tortillas, and a drink. Never a bad choice when you're choosing a fast food place."}
{"text":"Every single time I've been here, the cashier is new or has no idea what they are doing. It's sad that I even notice this. Maybe every second time ive been here, they mess up my order. I dont even order a lot."}
{"text":"sad. robotic people on the grill. looks good. cold as shit. coffee cup not full. sad. corporate glitter advertising, robotic grill workers. no love in the delivered product. why don't the corporate fat asses  get out in the field and fast the product.   no accountability"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the slowest Wendy's ever!  Every time I come it takes forever (drive thru or inside) but today was the straw that broke the camels back. I went inside seeing as how the dt was backed up. It took 15 min for me to get my #1 combo. I ordered a strawberry lemonade but it only had seeds no actual fruit and the girl (Sherri) took a pre-made one (a mistake I'm assuming) and shook it up and gave it to me. Then she placed my burger on a tray and then forgot about my order. After 15 min I asked about my food. Saw them unwrap my food then wrap it back up and they did this twice! Then put it in a bag and gave it to me. I've worked in food this was just the beginning of how bad this store it."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 Chicken Caesar Wraps to go and guess what??  The 3 sandwiches contained a half leaf of lettuce...BETWEEN THE 3 OF THEM.  When you sell a chicken caesar wrap you are selling a chicken caesar SALAD wrapped in some sort of pita."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite establishments in the Valley of the Sun. With modern decor and good 'ol western hospitality I would recommend this restaurant for anyone wanting to experience the culture of the South West. My personal dish recommendation at this fine eatery would be the hand breaded fried chicken breast. The meat itself is tenderized to perfection and the breading is so divine it would make Zeus blush. Once dipped in the barbecue relish my tastes buds exploded with delight. Already booking the flight for my next visit!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Wendy's around ive gone there the past 4 days in a row & everytime my order has been wrong & its just simple things like no cheese on my chicken sandwich or extra pickles and thet cant even do that right"}
{"text":"Painfully slow service. This is the slowest fast food restaurant in the world!  I have been here five times in the last four months with no more than four cars in line. It takes at least 15 minutes to get through. Unbelievably slow! If you are the owner of this franchise you need to get your act together. We are done coming here. You go to the McDonald's in town and they zip you right through."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a gas and rest stop and breakfast . I was very happy with the various options. The cashier was not very friendly and could barely hear what she was asking me, the food tasted good but not very warm especially the hash browns"}
{"text":"Great Wendy's!!! The customer service was great, everyone greeted us and even checked to see how we were enjoying our food, the Freestyle soda machine also great, and Keyena's great attitude is what motivated me to 'Yelp it'!   Keep up the good work Wendy's in Buckeye!!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is the worst one I have ever been too. My cashier Robyn was very rude. I ordered a frosty and a cheeseburger and she managed to mess that up. Also the entire staff always has an attitude. You wan in and no one greets you the staff just stands there starring at you until the designated register person walks up. Anyway drive 2 miles down the road and go to a different wendys"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst wendy's ever the cashier speaks so low you can't hear and all the unprofessional people back here serving COLD fries and the wait time is so long"}
{"text":"I like Wendy's. The food is good, especially the chili and frosty, and it's always consistent."}
{"text":"I like wendy's and haven't been in any of their new look stores yet but one of the reviews mentions that, in the new look stores, they are hyping the use of \"Sea Salt\". Uhh... be careful with seasalt. There is actually enough radioactive Uranium in sea salt that the japanese have used it as an ore for extracting radioactive uranium for making nuclear fuel rods. Total radioactive Uranium in all the oceans is in the 100's of billions of tons. If nuclear waste and radioactive stuff frighten you then you may want to let this sea salt craze pass you by."}
{"text":"After the remodel, this location looks excellent! Great look, good service, and really good food (as far as fast food goes)."}
{"text":"Good food, usually very fast, and a convenient location. I definitely recommend if you are looking for fast food"}
{"text":"Expecting fast food to be decent and prepared correctly is silly, I know.  Even with lowered expectations, this location of Wendy's is slipping fast.  I would say that there has been a management change recently (3 weeks) because incorrect orders, incorrect portion sizes, and a lack of straws/spoons (four frosty's, zero spoons...) have become the norm.  Outside of Cheers, nobody likes the norm.  The norm in fast food is that you feel ripped off, screwed around, hungry, and unlikely to come back."}
{"text":"We asked them for salt and ketchup and they asked us to pull up because we were waiting for fries and when they brought us our food and there was none in the bag the worker proceeded to tell us she was too busy. Too busy to do your job? And we went back through the window and she told us she was too busy again."}
{"text":"Got a supposedly fresh daily apple pecan chicken salad. Lettuce was brown, apples were mush. Just ended up throwing it in the trash. I've had a similar experience at this Wendy's before. Apprently I did not learn my lesson. Luckily not all Wendy's are like this because I love Wendy's. Avoid this one."}
{"text":"Must be the A-Team works after 10pm because this place was horrible.  I ordered 2 chicken sandwiches, and cheeseburger with fries at the drive-through and was immediately put off by this place.  I asked the guy if I could have a second to think about my order and he seemed to think that this was a major inconvenience to him when he stated \"whatever\" after I asked. Once I got home I opened the bag to eat my food.  I found that they had only given me one chicken sandwich(I realize I should've checked before I drove off, but I assumed they knew how to count).  Then I took out my cheeseburger and fries only to find out that they were pretty much frozen, awesome.  So, I will definitely not be coming here again."}
{"text":"I don't like giving negative reviews, but this place sucks!  My wife and I walked into this store Saturday 4/14/2018.  She stood in line for 15 minutes and not one person even acknowledged her.  This store is filthy.  The floors are dirty and sticky.  There are all dirty looking teen agers working there.  Long hair, beards, no beard guards or hair nets.  No managers or supervisors anywhere.  I have eaten at Wendy's for many years and this one is the worst ever.  Everyone working yesterday afternoon should be fired.  I am going to write the corporate office and let them know what a crummy operation this is."}
{"text":"Second time I have visited this location in the past week and both times were met with racial tensions. I feel they treated me different because I am white being the protest have been going on here in Charlotte. Which is absolutely ridiculous to treat me that way since I have been supporting the BLM moment and protest all week. Come on y'all.... BE THE CHANGE YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD!!"}
{"text":"Dirtiest Wendy's I have ever been to in my life. The woman's washroom swarmed with flies, as did the men's apparently and the restaurant wasnt much better. At 2pm on a Sunday afternoon all the customer area garbages were over flowing and all the tables were dirty.   The line up itself, while short, moved at a slow pace and once you had paid, the wait for your meal was even longer. The food was at least fresh and made as it should be.  It is too bad though that it took over 20 minutes.   I get this is not meant to be fine dining but even by fast food standards the service and cleanliness were ghastly. Scary stuff."}
{"text":"I got 2 crispy chicken sandwiches, 6 piece nugget, and a tea. When I went to eat the crispy chicken sandwich it tasted hard and not fresh. Like it had been sitting out for a long time.  Selling old food is not good for business. Hopefully this won't happen again."}
{"text":"Really has gone downhill. Managers and employees lack good customer service."}
{"text":"I asked for all my food fresh and all my food was cold cheese didn't even melt. French fries were soggy and nuggets were cold. Gave us barbecue when we all said ranch. The customer service was so shitty and unwelcoming. We had the fix the ketchup pump. Trays were left on tables and napkins were everywhere."}
{"text":"This location is awful.  I just went to the drivethru and ordered a 10pc nugget meal; nothing complicated.  I get to the window, they take my card, then tell me to pull up to wait on the nuggets.  I wait over 5 minutes only to be handed a bag with no drink.  I ask for the drink.  She walks back to the window to get it, comes back, I ask if she has the straw.  She has the nerve to tell me to pull back around for it!  WHAT???  And wait in the crazy long, slow as crap drivethru line for a straw??!!!!  Every visit here is a disaster, and this was the last time I bother."}
{"text":"Sunday night 530. I realize not the A team working that shift. But I was  still expecting more. Restrooms dirty for hours obviously, should have tipped me off. Trainee at register was trying hard. Our order wrong (even though she got it right on ticket). Same with the people ahead of us. Ordered baconator Frye's. Surprised the salt on these didn't cause us a stroke on the spot. No bacon on bacon cheeseburger. Kind of basic huh."}
{"text":"They made my burger wrong, I paid for a 1/2 lb. Double no tomatoes,  I got a single with tomatoes,  I told them they said tgey fixed it. I hot home and had a single, it was dry like McDonald's. Fries were way too salty. I'm a big Wendy's fan 3-4 times a week,  not this location. The manager was cussing (trying to keep it under his breath)."}
{"text":"I've been very pleased with this location. Very fast, friendly, and accurate service. Definitely one of the smoothest fast food operations in the area. Highly recommend if looking for fast food."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed this establishment! I think the workers are very polite and they made no excuses when they made a mistake. For an example, I went there once, ordering a sandwich and a couple other things. When I got home, my sandwich was not there. I called, and they were very apologetic and wanted to make it right. It's refreshing when someone owns their mistake, and the new sandwich was delicious! Another thing I like is that when I ordered my drink, they told me I could have it free. I really enjoyed their service!"}
{"text":"Cashier tells me they don't sell 4 for 4 on their menu. Instantly hate this airport and their Wendy's. Whack to say the least..."}
{"text":"Just got home after going out and trying to figure to get for din din for the family.  Got Carl's Jr for two people and Wendy's for the rest of the gang.... LOL.... For my son and me, I got the #11 combo which is the boneless wings with fries and a drink... We both got a Honey BBQ flavor and Spicy Chipotle for my Lil Sister. The combos are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo yummy that Lil Man was done eating before I started eating. LMAO.. It was just right!!"}
{"text":"Cold, bland and greasy; kind of like the owners attitudes at Seven Grains , lol. But seriously, Idk why I bother with this location. Yes the customer service is always nice but the food is terrible every single time!    Trying to get in and out of this place is also a nightmare; they really need to make the merging lanes for the drive- thru and parking lot wider."}
{"text":"There was no line wich was great but while discussing what to eat with my wife had to listen to two Co worker s speaking with vulgar Language about there sex life.  Was not given an option of wich sauses to go with my nugets or did they even try to sell me other options.  Wich is fine but rather hear that then the ongoing conversation from before.  Keep it classy Madison....."}
{"text":"Bruhh ! 3/28/18 12:55 pm i currently just left this Wendy's location ! I fw the service pulled up to the drive Thur and ordered and tht lady was very kind also I pulled up to the next window to pay tht guy was kind as well btw he told me to HAVE A GOOD DAY ! And they got my order correct plus my change was also correct \"@mcdonalds GET IT TOGETHER \" I love Wendy's !"}
{"text":"Hands down the WORST Wendy's I've ever been to.  After waiting in line for 10 minutes, we get to the window and are told to park because our food is not ready (which at the time is no big deal). But then we wait an additional 5 minutes for the \"Manager\" to bring out the food, to which I ask \"do you know if there are spoons in the bag for the Frostys we ordered?\" And Kelly (The Manager) replies \"Oh, nah they didn't tell me nothin' about that\" and continues to walk back into the store... so.. were you planning on getting them or what?   I wait a few seconds to see if she heads back to get any and I see her stop to conversate with another customer.. so I wait a little longer to see if she's still going to head back to get them.. nope.. she was still chatting away, so at that point I get out myself to go get the damn spoons and as I pass her I say \"So you weren't going to get them then?\" To which she replies \"Yes I was going to grab them for you\" and I let her know as I walk towards the counter \"I already waited 15 minutes for the food, how long does it take for spoons?\"  As I arrive to the counter I ask the guy there (who was slouched over) if I can have 3 spoons please he just points me over to where to get them instead of providing them himself. Ok..  I head back out to the car and pass Kelly again (since she's still chatting away) thanks for the awesome customer service, to which to continues to say she was planning on getting them, but it's her job to talk to customers if they address her (which is great, but if you have another customer that needs something that should have already been provided it's not hard to let them know you'll be right with them after you finish with the other customer).  I understand this is a fast food restaurant chain and don't expect the red carpet rolled out, but that doesn't excuse common sense or courtesy to acknowledge your \"intentions\" to come back out with what I asked for. It's people like Kelly at Wendy's that make us scoff and laugh at fast food workers wanting $15 an hour. And it's especially sad that she's supposedly the Manager and cant display true leadership for the rest of the staff that works here.   To top it all off they didn't even leave straws or the ranch that I asked for either. This Wendy's is a complete joke."}
{"text":"Worst costumer service. Older lady was extremely rude and didnt care for the service  wait extremely long. Terrible experience"}
{"text":"I'm currently at this location waiting for my food and all I can say is this place is seriously understaffed. There is only two people working here and there is over 30 people in the restaurant. The poor girl is taking orders as well as setting up the food for customers. Customers have even left because she couldn't get to them since she's working so hard to get orders ready. Management needs to get their act together because this is terrible service. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"No customer service. Food is ok, but no smiles, girl at the counter couldn't even look me in the eyes. Just need better training.."}
{"text":"My visit was during lunch so the food was hot and freshly prepared.  The store doesn't have a high sanitation rating. I would expect better from Wendy's. The lobby needed sweeping and no one showed any interest in correcting the problems. The staff wasn't concern about meeting my request for no ice. Guess she thought disregarding me gave her power."}
{"text":"Good friendly service. I have actually seen them clean tables and chairs! Good thing to see when so many restaurants don't seem to care. ..  When are the fish sandwiches coming back?!"}
{"text":"All of our order was right,  food was good staff very friendly. Store appeared to be very clean."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru about 6pm on 3/31/2012 to get a Spicy Chicken Combo.  I paid for the meal and drove off.  When I got to my destination about 2 miles away and opened the bag, I found cold fries and a cold sandwich.  I am not talking about cold as in \"not hot Enough\", I mean they were cold as in \"Left over from lunch\"  The fries were cold and rubbery.  I threw them away.  Next I unwrapped my Spicy Chicken-my personal favorite fast food sandwich of all time.  The chicken was not hot and juicy as I expected.  It was not warm and juicy.  Thats right, it was cold and rubbery.  When I took the bun off to examine the sandwich, the chicken was weirdly flat and the coating hung away from the chicken.    I will continue to have my Spicy Chicken fix, but NOT at this store.  When I called to complain, the phone just rang and rang.  Whoever is running the Saturday evening shift, needs a stern talking to about quality and customer service.  One Star is definitely a generous review for the Wendy's at 20242 N. 27TH AVENUE in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I went here 2 days in a row. On the first day I asked for a Daves Double and they gave me a Single. On the second day I ordered a 4 for 4 deal and they only gave me three chicken nuggets when it comes with an order of four.   The food is good but the service is ass."}
{"text":"Worst. That is all I can think of when I stepped into this Wendy's. I stood in line for what seemed like hours watching the incompetent staff doing the same task all together instead of methodically answering to each concern, example - customers, food cook and preparation and service. When taking my order,  a problem with a previous order reared its ugly head, which was wrong and they had to try to figure it out while I waited for what seemed like another hour.  In conclusion incompetent staff create long wait lines and orders that are most of the time, wrong.  If you feel like waiting for a crazy amount of time and receiving an incorrect order then this is the place for you otherwise I would recommend going anywhere else. And to be fair however it was clean."}
{"text":"I was just here with my children and let me say I do not go to McDonalds because i dont like the quality of food and i know Wendys for being fast food to me is just a little better. However if i can get better customer service i would rather give my money to them workers who know how to show respect and a manager who knows how to set an example for her team. I was just at this Wendys at 2pm with my children and its very sad that my kids had to witness these workers being so rude and unprofessional and witness the manger cussing me out and flipping me off. All over them forgetting to give me my small frosty for my daughter. That was the reason i went and the person running the drive thru was just giving me a dirty look and asking me to move out of the way when she had not completed my order. Then another girl wants to just be all up in the mix as well and get in on whatever action she thought she had. I would have been more than happy to pay for the ITEM your employees forgot to ring up if it wasn't for their nasty attitudes. I would say you need to hire people that love customers not rude individuals who are just looking for a paycheck at some point people need to love their job and helping others in order to work face to face with customers on a daily basis.   Let me say I will never go back to this Wendy's again an believe that one rude experience will keep a lot of people away and i will be happy to share with my family and friends the experience i had at this location due to this manager who on her time runs this store in a very poor way. I am a manager myself and would never address a concern this way my cursing at my customer. It would be in Wendy's best judgement to hire clean house and hire some people who are friendly and upbeat and are excited just to have a job and know how to give respect to get respect..   Again my children had to witness this and now they surely are aware of the language that i try to prohibit them hearing.. Thank you Wendy's now my kids know the foul words i didnt need them to know."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late night dinner after 11PM on a Thursday following a day of traveling. The drive through staff were very friendly and cheerful. A great experience for a late-night dinner."}
{"text":"How the hell has the Health Department not shut this place down? Absolutely disgusting! As I was waiting to order i witnessed and employee semi pick their nose and went right back to making sandwiches. I walked out! With complaints of smells and cockroaches it's amazing they are still open! STAY CLEAR!!"}
{"text":"Well it was around 10:30 with nothing really open decided to stop at wendys I frequent there often and have stopped going as often due to many mistakes. . Usually they are very accommodating with there mistakes replace the incorrect items no problem.  Not today! I called to inform them my supposed to be grilled chicken was a fried chicken sandwich and my other sandwich that was supposed to be grilled with no veggies or sauce was the complete opposite. Even with the mistake that is not the big issue here I spoke with yasenia and was spoken to with such rudeness I'm still appalled. She proceed to call me a liar as well as obscenities that will not be repeated .. over a sandwich I mean really the absolute worst customer service I've ever had no people skill what so ever. I personally manage for a large Corp company and if any of my people spoke that way to a customer on the phone they would be out the door in the very same minute.   Just a word of advice manager to shift leader yasenia I have more pressing matters then to call wendys at 11:00 at night to complain about my meal. After that little display I will be taking this much high. I expect an apology for the verbal abuse"}
{"text":"The five stars is for fantastic customer service.  Had to pick up an office order today.  Order was ready when I got there,  manager Frank brought it to my car and everything was right!  Not too often that nice things are said about fast food places, but this one definitely gets a shout out!"}
{"text":"Wish i could rate this zero stars. I ordered one meal.  The woman taking orders cut me off at that. Did not ask if i would like anything else.Um yeah i wanted to order more but i was given my total after ordering the one meal. So my kids split the one meal.  I was left with nothing. Completely RUDE!!!!! They were not even busy but appeared to be in a huge rush."}
{"text":"This is thee only Wendy's I will go to!! Clean, friendly staff, amazing food! I've been there several times and each time I get my food it is ALWAYS SERVED FRESH AND HOT!!!!! Very impressive and delicious for a fast food place! Actually for a restaurant in general. Very impressed! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to the location across the street from the hospital at about midnight as my wife was resting in CCU from surgery. The food was terrible. My hamburger was thrown together, French fries were greasy and stale. I work hard for my money and I'm tired of places assuming we'll take anything less than below average service. Their is no pride of ownership at this location and I would never eat here again, or it will be a long time before I try another's Wendy's."}
{"text":"Evertime I go to this Wendy's my order is wrong. I have to repeat myself mutiple times and it is still wrong. The drive thru cashiers obviously aren't familiar with their menu when I'm reading off the sign and they are clueless, or it may be that they struggle with English. Either way, I will be going to McDonald's from now on."}
{"text":"Rude workers and barely any toppings on my burgers ever! I go shopping and want a quick burger fix but every time I come to this location it's the same thing. Idk why I keep coming back! Geeze on me! I even debate on del taco but noooo I choose Wendy's and the same thing every time! Take my $20 and screw me over! Smashed burgers, no toppings and practically throw my food at me! How rude! And when I ask for salt every time I get rolling eyes! Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Fast food isn't high on my dinning priority list. But there are times when a car picnic is necessary. Wendy's is my go to gal. Baked sweet and regular potatoes are a must. Just make sure they aren't all shriveled up resembling a dino egg fossil.   As with all drive thru orders, check your order before you pull away. Even if you feel the car behind you breathing down your tailpipe. Better than getting a mile away and realizing you have no fork for the potato and no straw for the Biggie ice tea."}
{"text":"If i could have left a negative star rating I would. The staff is usually not the nicest bunch. More times than not our order is wrong or better yet missing items. Currently mess up from them is when you order a Asiago CHICKEN club, you get beef patties instead. The wrapper even says chicken on it!!! So, if you would like to visit a place that will mess up your order, make things wrong every time, and not smile and say \"Have a good day\", then you have come to the right place.... time to find a new Wendy's or even better yet, a new place to have our occasional meal out.."}
{"text":"This particular Wendys has been getting too much business from me and I dont like it. Im trying really hard to slim down the ole waist line and eating here does not help.  The salads are delicious.  It's healthy. When theres cheese, grilled chicken pieces, yummy dressing, and other yummy's.  The chili is awesome ,  I'm crazy about all the beans.I used to make this stuff back in high school. Wendys was after all my very first J.O.B. I used to get the fries and make myself chili cheese fries all of the time !  Out of all the fast food places, Wendys apparently has sentimental value to me. My first paycheck and my first slice of financial freedom.  This location just happens to be the place I worked at. I come here everytime I am in Vegas, I love the food and the people are still nice."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's.  It is a homegrown fast food chain from Ohio.  Their burgers are better than any other fast food joint out there.  If you happen to want a burger on the go, hit up Wendy's, just not this location.  This location has a habit of messing up your order and not fixing it.  If you have to stop here, make sure you check your bag before leaving, because once you do, they won't fix it."}
{"text":"Day time is probably the best time to get great customer service. As little unprofessional but it's better then most.  Customer service at night shift is the worse. Went there 3 times and the manager has the worse attitude and is horrible with taking orders in drive through. Lines are long only bc it's really the only one in that area that is open late. Which is a plus"}
{"text":"Wendy's is fine, especially considering it's the only fast food burger place around the area (not counting five guys and mooyah).  The outside is kind of sketchy, especially at night, but the inside is a bit more inviting.  The staff is pretty nice, and their food is decent."}
{"text":"Tried the new Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was outstanding, great BBQ sauce, crunchy slaw, tasty pork and only 430 calories. Must Eat!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually just get the mchicken at McDonald's but I tried the dollar chicken sandwich at Wendy's yesterday and it was way better than McDonald's. I'll be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Wendy's I've visited.  Devote is very dated - the duct tape on the seats didn't help either.  The food did not taste fresh (multiple visits too).  The staff were very unfriendly and seemed bothered just to do their job.  Also being told that the limit on hot sauce was \"one packet per customer\", flabbergasted me.  After 3 disappointing visits will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Yikes. Was in a hurry and off schedule, so thought I'd make a quick stop at Wendy's to grab a burger to tide me over. My thinking was it had to be a better option than McD's (right across the street, btw) and faster than the Panera you can see from the parking lot. Didn't think I needed to check reviews before stopping, because, I mean, it's Wendy's, you know? Certainly not high end, but generally reliable, no? Well -- not this one.  Around 6 on a Saturday, so was concerned about it being busy, but it wasn't. Only two couples there ahead of me. Few people in drive thru. All tables open. Most of them still crumby from earlier diners. First sign of trouble -- Couple #1 waits for food, tray with 2 orders of fries and a burger on it already. Counter staff appears with 2 more burgers and seems to become paralyzed with confusion -- looking at the tray, at the 2 wrapped burgers in her hands, back at the tray, at the order on the screen, back at the burgers. This is made more weird by Couple #1, who just stood there and watched. Managed to keep my manners and not say something along the lines of, \"Maybe just tell her what you ordered?\" People!  Couple #2 ordered a salad and 2 bowls of chili. (You know there's a problem if I'm able to repeat everyone's orders for you!) Sounds simple enough -- total of 5 people there, including me -- and they had to wait at least 15 minutes. Person behind the counter is in NO hurry atall. In the meantime, some dude comes in to sort out a drive thru glitch. Apparently, they ordered 3 salads, then changed it to 4, but were charged for 5. This required a  manager's intervention to resolve  but they handled it. Again, I know WAY too much about this.  Finally got my sandwich (was ok) and fries (almost cold), found a sort of less crumby table and sat down. Counter person took this lull in traffic to take a break, oblivious to the messy in the dining room. Trash cans were messy and smelly. Get your act together Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Avoid. These guys have yet to get my order right after 3 visits. Nothing exciting either. Hamburger with catsup. Every time there's something wrong. I'll get a burger with everything, burger with mustard, chicken sandwich...  Definition of Durp. Their receipts print the taunting statement of \"Concerns please call\" and no number."}
{"text":"It might all look good  on Tv but when you get it looks like nothing fit for a Hunan  . Ordered the chicken  sandwich  special.  IT had tomato  slice cut by a ninja  knife . Super thin . Sandwich  was all soggie from sitting under heat lights premade . These fast burger place don't care about there products  it's just sell sell . Who care about customer."}
{"text":"So my kids like frosty so do I. It has always been a great service until one day. I wanted to surprise my kids, for some strange reason I ended up with burnt bun for my spicy chicken .... That left a bad taste in my month. My kids were so excited about the nice surprise I decided to keep calm about the burnt meal. I have stay away from there for a while.... switching to mac flurys for a while."}
{"text":"Employees are very unfriendly and the restaurant inside was disgusting. Not sure how this place is still operational."}
{"text":"You guys let me down tonight...  forgot my drink, gave me ranch and sirarcha with a hole in it in the shape of a fingernail... which i didn't ask for, baked potato was over cooked.. forgot sour cream, i opted to take nuggets instead of chicken strips since it was late and it would be a 4 minute wait... and you put a plain chicken patty on a spicy chicken sandwich. Total fail.   3 stars because I'll prob be back regardless :/"}
{"text":"The building has been razed and they are building a new Wendy's at the same location."}
{"text":"It isn't very clean but the food is a lot cheaper than the park food at Carowinds!! We fed a family of 5 for less than one meal at the park."}
{"text":"The thing about fast food chains is that they are all pretty similar from one to the next. A location has to do something particularly awful or outstanding to blip the radar.  A couple of the things that can vary and that matter to me, are customer service and the drive-thru efficiency.  This Wendy's does both well!  The only reason I'm at this location is if I'm running out for some lunch during work, so I am almost always there at noon during the lunch rush.  The parking lot shared with several other businesses is always busy, and the drive-thru line wraps around to mix in with the cross-traffic, getting quite jumbled.  Luckily, the line moves smoking' fast!  This is due in part to the usual drive-thru cashier. She has the change counted out and ready before I even get to the window, so IF I pay in cash, she's prepared. If I don't, no foul.  The team inside must be crazy efficient, because the order flies forward... and is correct every time.  The cherry on top is that everyone is always super nice.  Even the faceless voice behind the ordering menu is polite, clear, and lighthearted.    Well done, Wendy's!"}
{"text":"The renovations did this Wendy's wonders!  It looks amazing inside, with all updated fixtures, clean lobby area, and one of those futuristic coke machines.  The service is consistently super friendly, which is impressive for fast food.  I like that they take our first names at the counter, so when the order is ready they can holler \"ERIN!\" rather than \"#309!\"  It's just more personal.  They happily gave us extra pecans for our salads, and joked around during the payment process.  It was a refreshing experience.  I like the Wendy's menu for the most part, but I wouldn't choose them over some competitors for a burger and fries.  Unless I want a frosty, chili or baked potato, I don't usually consider Wendy's.  I have however fallen in love with their salads!  They are fresh, tasty, healthy, and overall guilt-free.  Extra tasty (though slightly more guilt) with those extra pecans!"}
{"text":"I'm  giving two stars just because the food was good for a fast food. Service at the drive thru was horrible. No customer service, very nasty and not friendly. This is not my first time. The service alwyas bad. Employee lack Customer Service skills. Maybe that is why I did not get my receipt to be able to do there online survey.You need the receipt number to fill the survey on line. Please someone retrain your employees."}
{"text":"Wendy's is not fine dining. But i do expect to not only get what I asked for but not get cold food. On both account this Wendy's has failed.  The first time went through the drive thru they got my order wrong. When I went inside to tell them they forgot a burger they gave me attitude. They finally gave me the burger with no \" sorry about that\".  The second time. I ordered, the service was fine and fast. But the fries were cold and stale. The burger was barely warm. I can only guess due to the speedy delivery that someone else had ordered this and it had been sitting out.  Will not go back and if I do need a Wendy's burger that bad I will drive the 2miles to the other one."}
{"text":"I wish I could no star because I found a bug crawling out of my burger when I unwrapped it. See last photo on photo stream."}
{"text":"Always painfully slow. No one seems to have a clue what's going on, nor do they care that they don't. Wendy's used to be a safe choice for fresher than the norm fast food. Now I avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Not bad for a fast food restaurant. Typical burgers and fries and somewhat reasonable priced. Not worth a glowing 5 star rating though."}
{"text":"While I normally don't expect much from fast food generally, at least having the food prepared and kept hot shouldn't be a big deal.  I'm guessing your \"4 for 4\" promotion has gone so well, you've decided to just produce mass quantities of the items included and keep them on hand. Bad idea. Also, you might want to do some basic maintenance on your soft drink dispensers.  Regular Coke shouldn't have the taste of diet, or worse, BE diet when regular Coke was ordered.  Oh, and it's not very smart for your drive-thru person to be more concerned about her broken fingernail than a customer's order.  Just be glad we didn't find it in any of our food, or this would be way worse for this location.  Freshly prepared food USED to be a reason I chose Wendy's over other places.  Now, the lack of fresh food is a reason I will now avoid it."}
{"text":"Food wise it's ok. But the cashier Miranda G. Is very nice and has great customer service."}
{"text":"Had a good experience, I normally just get the fries and frosty. But sadly the hours on Yelp is not accurate. They don't open up until 10AM"}
{"text":"Good luck getting what you order they don't listen to you.  They grab your money and shove food at you with a scowl on their faces."}
{"text":"I ate lunch at the 90th St Wendy's in Scottsdale yesterday 4/25. I forgot my wallet there and didn't know it was missing till the next day 4/26, I looked all over my house, couldn't find it, I traced my steps back to Wendy's, praying that they found it, THEY DID!!!! what a relief, I had my 2 credit cards, my  Drivers license, my ATM card and other receipts that I needed from my wallet. I wasn't even thinking of the $400.00 + Dollars I had in the wallet, but everything was there and I was so Grateful and Amazed.   I don't know if this is a corporate store or a Franchisee store, But I want to send a Big THANK YOU!!! to the Mgr. on duty on both days Christie & her staff.   I'm from Hawaii, so we say \"Mahalo Nui Loa\"  (many thanks with gratitude)  Aloha, Allan Kunewa"}
{"text":"Drive-thru line can be pretty slow at times. The food isn't bad for fastfood."}
{"text":"They get 3 stars because of their food. It's usually right on and tastes really good.  Otherwise, they would get 2 stars because of their service. Wendy's is the only fast food place I've seen that has the same person take your order and fill your order. Normally someone takes it and there are people back in the kitchen filling it so that the line keeps moving. Not here. The person takes your order and then has to run around collecting your drink, your food, whatever else - keeping everyone waiting behind you in line instead of getting the next order fired up for the kitchen.  So frustrating. Go here when you're not in a rush. Or use the drive through. For some reason that seems to move faster."}
{"text":"You're getting $15 an hour now to mess up fast food orders? They made me wait for 15min and even then they didn't get my order right. You guys must really struggle with life's more demanding tasks."}
{"text":"Daves triple combo have been great here Lemonade is very good It's just missing Single tables to eat there (that's why 4 stars....perhaps the airport should provide tables between seats because is very very limited)"}
{"text":"I worked at a Wendy's store years ago and know how the place operates. So, my review should be taken into full consideration by management.   At 10:45 PM on a Saturday night, the restaurant portion was closed. So, we went through the drive-through. It took us prompting the clerk over the speaker in order for someone to acknowledge our presence. She said it would be a moment. About 5 mins later, we told her that if we didn't hear back from her in 60 seconds, we were calling the police because we felt that staff could be held up by a burglar. After this, she took our order.   At the window, she said it would be 4 more minutes for chicken nuggets. It took longer than this. All in all, AS THE ONLY GUESTS AT THIS WENDY'S, it took us about 15 minutes from start to finish to get our order for only 2 people.   I believe that she was the ONLY person working in the store. That's against policy and dangerous.   Totally nuts!"}
{"text":"This location is horrid for customer service and getting your order right.  We ordered at the drive thru last week and they screwed up the order. Not having time to return we returned later in the day. Bill in hand and brought the concern to the manager.  He told us we should have called or returned. He claimed we did not try to call and he could do nothing to compensate us for receiving the wrong order.  Today we had a similar experience and called as previously directed. This time we got a different answer we should have brought it to their attention right away . We did . We called.  It took 3 phone calls and 3 hours for them to say too bad.  Customer service ...not . My advice .. go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Returned today to replace a poor meal from the fall.  Previously the drive thru screwed up the order. Fried were cold and burgers under cooked with green tomatoes. Our previous concerns were addressed with a replacement whenever we could get back.  Today was the day.  No idea what we are talking about seems they throw out concerns more than 90 days old. If it happens to you return to the store right away or don't bother complaining . Lesson learned ."}
{"text":"I would also give this location a zero if I could. This is probably the worst service I've received, every time, even for a fast food place. It's almost like everyone just stopped caring about anything in this location, even HR. Dissapointed every time :("}
{"text":"Ordered the taco salad, when I got home they  forgot the chips. That was fine I had some at home. I put everything together and before I could take a bite I could smell old meat. The chili was gross smelling and looked like they chopped up some old hamburger patties I couldn't stand the smell let alone the taste."}
{"text":"The Baconator. How can you not?   I rather like Wendy's for fast food...There is just something about those square hamburgers...You know like the Huey Lewis song.  The hamburger is amazing, two square patties, something around a billion pieces of bacon and cheese dripping enoughh off the sides to leave you a delicious desert of lickable cheese paper.  I have a thing for their soggy salty fries, it is hard to scoop up frosty with them, but once you do you are in freakish eater heaven. The salt and chocolate are just the right combination.  This peticular resturaunt was lame, even by fast food standards. The drive-through was not friendly, I got only two napkins, no spoon for my frosty (thank god for the fries) and no offer of ketchup.  The Baconator will be back...and soon, and I doubt that you want to use a Wendy's bathroom so take it home."}
{"text":"Let staff know about dairy allergy, read my order off, they repeated it back to me. When I left I checked my bag to find I had been over charged and was given cheeseburgers. Normally I don't like to get a wrong order but I can eat it anyway but this time I had to throw it away. Upsetting to say the least. Staff was unfriendly, slow and incompetent."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Wendy's decided to close at 3am instead of their posted 4am close time. That wasn't even the bad part of the experience. They had me waiting on a long line of cars (20 minutes)"}
{"text":"Nothing too fancy here, just a Wendy's. Food was as expected. Had to get the hamburger remade once, since the special order was delivered incorrectly. The Tim's in the same building is very popular, so the queue was in the way of getting to the Wendy's ordering area. Service with a smile otherwise."}
{"text":"Ordered the Homestyle Chicken Sandwich, nothing homestyle about it... it was dry and overcooked.  Called and spoke with the manager she advised me to tell them to drop a fresh one the next time I come in!!!!! Is that considered a special order???? Isn't it suppose to be fresh the first time around? Asking for a friend"}
{"text":"Buen restaurante de comida rápida. El espacio es amplio y el servicio rápido.  Las hamburguesas de sabor muy aceptable siendo un sitio de comida rápida y buena relación calidad precio."}
{"text":"I have been here half a dozen times and it is consistent and they try to move things along. It's pretty simple as it is Wendy's so you can eat healthy with a salad or go for  Baconator. What's not to like. Plus you have a view of the planes landing over your head at the airport."}
{"text":"I\"ve always been a fan of Wendy's.  For some reason, I DO like the taste of the burger patties better than some places.  I think it's because it seems to be always juicy & very tasty when I get my order.  The chicken nuggets are good too.  Kids are a fan of 'em! I've tasted better fries though.  The frosty is always good as well... Gotta have the frostys!! =)  Very rare that I get disappointed when I get my orders.  Although some of the workers (NOT at this place in particular) can be rude at times."}
{"text":"I generally try to avoid this Wendy's.  It's been a few years, but I once went inside at lunch and what I could see behind the counter was filthy.  Food on the floor, just a complete mess.  The parking lot is kind of confusing because you have to loop around the building before you can get into the drive-thru lane.    I did, however, really enjoy the unsweetened strawberry iced-tea they are featuring this summer.  That \"smoked gouda\" chicken sandwich they have is a flavorless joke though."}
{"text":"Seriously you guys cry about wanting $15 an hour but you can't take a simple ass order my kids are allergic to mustard and I clearly said no unions no mustard and get it's all over this damm burger. If u can't understand English get out of fast food and go do phone order where no one understands your ass.    Will never be back   What a way to treat your combat veterans   A+ if you want your order all messed up!!!!!!!   $15 hour what a joke you fools don't deserve even $8 all you do is flip burgers and drop frys that's on a timer you guys work so hard for your $$$$$$$$$$  Sincerely,   Never returning customer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Lady taking my order had a thick east european accent and talked so fast that I couldn't really understand most of what she said.  I had to have her repeat herself and try and speak slowly and she acted like I just insluted her.  Well, I normally don't tray and insult people who are trying to take my fast food order, just don't have the time and inclination for this.  Maybe I should blame management for putting someone in a position of taking orders who has a communication problem."}
{"text":"No wait at lunch hour. Not sure why there were such bad reviews. I had no issues. The Very service was super fast & my order was hot. This location has the new push button fountain and is kept very clean."}
{"text":"Renovated Wendy's = Better Dining Experience.   I typically don't review fast food chains but this Wendy's always meets expectations. Tonight when the wife was craving a hamburger we ordered inside for carry out. The menu has changed too and they have some great new items as well as all the classics we had through the years.   Kudos to the staff for a clean environment too."}
{"text":"You'd expect the standard fare from Wendys but this one gives off a very sketch vibe. My friends and I came in for a late night snack.   My friend wanted no ice in his drink. However, when the employee was preparing the drink she noticed that she put in ice, which is a normal mistake and usually not an issue. What was shocking was that she took the ice shovel and SHOVED it into my friends cup to retrieve the ice cubes and threw it right back into the bin. Unsure whether that is to proper health standards.   I sent a feedback review to ask whether this was normal practice, to which I received a generic response saying something along the lines of, 'we care about health and here's a hush drink.' At the end of the day, it feels like the issue will be swept under the rug. Makes you think about what other sketchy practices they maintain at this location (or brand in general), eh?"}
{"text":"Yesterday I had a very late evening and against my better judgement stopped here to get a cheeseburger rather than cook at home at 9PM. The burger came browned on outside, raw on the inside.  Empoyee workers could care less when I went back inside after biting into the thing and thinking \"yech.\" Employees handed to manager and showed no interest whatsoever at this. Manager didn't know quite what to do .. offered to make me another - I told him I had no appetite for a burger now, please just give me a refund. The excuse I got was that the timer on the burger grill doesn't always work right, and sometimes opens the grill early. .   You'd think they would be a little more concerned about serving uncooked meat. The staff are clueless and careless millenials.   This experience has turned me off of fast food - and certainly Wendy's"}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's I've ever been too!!! They are rude and seems like they just want you out of the drive thru lane that they almost throw the food at you. Sucks this is the closest Wendy's to my work.  Those employees are making Wendy's look bad!"}
{"text":"Here comes a bizarre review of a chain. I think that, partially, the reason for this review is because I never go to Wendy's. I usually just get McDonald's any time I want to be \"bad.\" But yesterday I wanted something a little less disgusting.  I got the \"pick two\" with an apple/pecan/chicken salad and a small chili. Um, BEST CHILI EVER. What the eff? I think that chili was better than I could make at home. The salad was ok- not great, BUT much better than any other fast-food salad I've tasted.  Can't say anything about the interior, as we did drive-thru, but I told my husband to remind me that I want Wendy's anytime we're on a road trip and I can't decide which of the various evils to shove down my gullet."}
{"text":"I live in another area of town but we were on our way to Bass Pro shop and decided to grab a bite. As far as fast food goes I enjoy Wendy's. This location however is one of the most ridiculous excuses for a business I have been to in a long while. Jesse our server was the highlight of this meal. He was nice and apologetic for the number of mishaps to come.    We arrived around 4pm because I remembered for several months driving by they advertised $1.99 kids meals after 4. I asked Jesse and he regretfully explained that promo was over. No big deal, promos end. I asked for the NEW Steakhouse Cheese Burger..... I couldn't get it because they were out of Steakhouse sauce. Part of our order was a crispy chicken sandwich with out lettuce. Bam it cam with lettuce. I went to get ketchup for our fries.... Bam out of ketchup. I went to get coke.... Bam out of coke. At a nearby table were some employees sitting and eating. No big deal if they weren't dropping the F bomb over and over. Oh and can we talk about the amount of flies buzzing our food. YUCK!!!!  I was disappointed with this location.I feel Wendy's has tried to separate it's self from other fast food places. This felt like I left a bunch of 12 year old children to run my business. Do yourself  a favor and run down the street to Mesa River view  where any of the  food choices are far superior."}
{"text":"They always take forever and they don't have the best customer service either. I love Wendy's, but not this location.."}
{"text":"I can't count how many fast food places I've been to across the country, but this is by far the worst service I've ever come across to. It took 15 minutes for my friends to wait for the sandwiches and another five to get my root beer float because the workers forgot. Adding insult to injury, one of the managers yelled \"What are they still doing here?\" like we were bothering them, but in reality we were waiting for our food. If you live in Chandler and the only other Wendy's open is in Scottsdale and you really wanted Wendy's badly, go make the drive out to Scottsdale instead."}
{"text":"Sorry guys. I have been going to this Wendy's since the place opened years ago. Last few visits keep me from even wanting to go. Let's see if I can update this review soon. Up the quality control and training"}
{"text":"This is an update to my previous review. Manager and district manager told me over and over that the used bandaid that fell out of my salad could not have been from their employees as they use BLUE band aids. If you look real close at this manager, she has a TAN band aid on. This photo was taken during a Girl Scout troop outing. I still won't eat here. The drop off point was not my choice."}
{"text":"I've had some bad experiences lately with other Wendy's drive thru not getting my order right 3 times in a row and being rude, so I felt inclined to post.   This Wendy's was great! After I placed my order in the drive thru, I drove up and my food bag was already out the window. It was super fast and my order was correct. The food was hot and the lady that was working the drive thru was super friendly as well :) definitely my new Wendy's in this area."}
{"text":"This place is so unprofessional and nasty it's ridiculous I went in after coming from getting birth certificates was pretty hungry when I walked in with my husband I was not greeted after ordering my husband ordered he only had a hundred dollar bill so they took his order and the manager went to go get change in the process the original cashier left to while another gentlemen waited for about 5 mins finally being acknowledge the manager took his order and instead of her waiting for him to get the change she just took it out his twenty and she just told him o i already cashed it out i work in the fast food industry and we are not allowed to do such we work to achieve customer  satisfaction but back to my husband change finally 15 mins later he  gets his change but the hamburger he had was cold and so was my however the fries were good but they customer service sucks if they don't fix that soon they will loose a lot of business"}
{"text":"Really? You are a fast food restaurant. How do you run out of chicken nuggets and chicken tenders? Then got stuck in the drive through waiting behind another car for almost 10 whole minutes?"}
{"text":"I went through the drive thru and waited 5 minutes to have my order taken. I repeated it 3 times because the guy wasn't listening. He was obviously distracted. I had to go to the window to get him to understand what I was ordering...5 small chocolate and 1 vanilla Frosty. It wasn't complicated. All the same size. I get to the window and the guy working it actually yelled at the guy to wait. I was going to request to speak to the manager but he was the manager. If you go here expect horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! They hog the entire parking lot and tow anyone who has the nerve to park there and walk into Savers. They have huge rude signs about it everywhere. Savers is a non-profit that supports Big Brothers, Big Sisters. This location meeds to go under for being so awful to a non-profit."}
{"text":"I arrived at the drive thru for this Wendy's at approximately 7:40pm, I was able to immediately drive up to the pedestal to place my order.  Unfortunately nobody on the other side felt compelled to acknowledge someone had pulled up; after about 3-4 minutes of waiting, I concluded that their drive through system must be broken and decided to pull ahead, I turned the corner and saw 2x cars waiting for the window and decided to pull around and go inside.  I went inside and there was one person ordering food.  Immediately after his order, the cashier/clerk dude sped off into the back, completely ignoring me.  To be clear, not one word was uttered.  The rest of the people working seemed content to ignore me as well.  After about 5 minutes of this, I got frustrated and left.   Remember folks, while your experience may vary from mine, it could also be similar, I say avoid this one."}
{"text":"Nothing \"Fast\" about this food. Not sure what the staff is doing in there, but they sure are doing it slow. Luckily, half the cars in the drive-thru left, so it only took me a half hour to get my food"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and it was better than the Wendy's in racetrack road but not great. They needed to change their grease in the deep fryer. It seemed old and the chicken was cold."}
{"text":"Ordered a breakfast sandwich combo. It was only 8:23 am and already they looked tired. Poor customer service. Both employees were not friendly and lacked respect. Felt like they were being disturbed. First impression was enough.... Never going back.  A 1 Star is even generous !"}
{"text":"Worst location besides Charleston and rainbow.... every.... SINGLE.... TIME.... We go there, we get cold/stale food, absolutely ZERO personality when taking the order.. There's always an issue there, and it's never fixed! They've given half full fries, and the worst Version of a taco salad I've ever seen...  I'd say out of the 80 times there, maybe 5 were decent. Wendy's itself has some good deals and tasty food though - I TRULY miss their old fries. The softer Wendy's fries. Yummmmm."}
{"text":"Been here before and it was awful... today it was terrific!!! The staff was helpful and friendly and the food was just as it should be, tasty fries, lucy burger, great chilli.  If you haven't been here for a while, you should come back.  Kudos to the team that made this Wendy's great again!"}
{"text":"Dirty toilet, hasn't been cleaned in a LONG time, assumed the kitchen was the same way, did not eat here. I have in the past, typical Wendy's fare."}
{"text":"Had a burger and a side salad here. I always love Wendy's burgers and a burger with a side salad I think is just the right combination of healthy.   Thanks Wendy's!"}
{"text":"We are in 2017... there are no charging stations in the Wendy's. What a bust. I love this place to do business at but what good does that do if I don't have a place to charge my phone.... I instantly left. I have no desire to eat in a franchise that is still living the days of the 50s.   Oh and you can read this with a petty voice..."}
{"text":"Sometimes the nuggets taste like alcohol , seems like they are not using the tongs and are using the gloves in which the employees have hand Sanitizer on ..Wont be going there anytime soon and the food is always soggy and fries are cold and old. They also almost always \"forget\" the sauce to the nuggets..."}
{"text":"I have never experienced a more unprofessional fast food restaurant in my life. My friend and I had ordered online at 10:30pm so I could pick it up and go back to work because we work nights. I guess we should have clicked the drive thru option instead of carry out but I didn't realize how late it was and that the dining area was closed already. So I go through the drive thru and they tell me they don't have access to online orders and that I should come back at 10 am because they might charge my card for it. I ask if there's anything they can do and I get told no. So after debating going somewhere else I end up just ordering the two things we ordered online and end up sitting waiting for my food for ten minutes. They didn't give me sauce, gave me a size small for a meal that I said was medium multiple times. The lady in the drive thru was talking to her coworkers in the background as well. The first thing she says to me after she takes my payment is \"sorry it smells so bad in here\". Uh.. okay? She was also playing on her phone. I get my food and ask for a receipt because they hadn't given me one and they say they are out of receipt papers so I can't even prove that they messed up my order.   I'm just glad I was able to cancel my online order and get refunded the money that they already had taken out."}
{"text":"I usually love Wendy's but i have had an encounter with the manager and he was straight up rude. And today I went around 950 am to get some food and according to their website Wendy's open at 7 am and I sat in the drive thru for 5 min and no one said that they were closed or asked me if I want anything. There was 4 cars parked out front so I am sure there were people in side. Now i called later in the day to get clarification on when they open, and the phone rang for 2 min... At 130 in the afternoon. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to review this place to give it 5 stars for just one sandwich.  For what it is (fast food) their hamburger (not all of them) is top notch.  Here's the deal.  Go in and get a 1/2 pound double with cheese.  No substitutions.  Nada.  Get some napkins too.  You'll need them.  I'm pretty snobby about burgers. Holy crap is it good. It just is. I almost hate that it is so damn good.  BUT IT IS!  Could be that I didn't spend $13 dollars on it, BUT IT IS!"}
{"text":"How can a single store consistently put out such horrible items. Now I will say that I do go late and usually only because everything else is closed but is that an excuse? You are open, you are open. Its has been several months since I last was traumatized with old, stale EVERYTHING but last night after a 5 hour trip up to Flagstaff and back, I was desperate at the thought of having to make something at home. It was last night 12:45 (close at 1:00) I ordered 2 Jr Chz Dlx (extra pickles and onions) and a small chili with onions. Well I got a cheeseburger with guess what? Pickles and onions- nothing else and oh yeah, a 2/3 full cup of room temperature chili. OMG why don't I learn????? I have had AWESOME Wendy's before- It can be done. Maybe if I went at lunch I would have better luck but but under no circumstances am I risking a lunch meal there. I am a night nurse so many times I go to these places because of my busy schedule so this is my excuse- What is yours Wendy's? PS....... Never again"}
{"text":"Absolute worst service. I waited in the drive thru 30 MINUTES! I pull in at 9:40pm and sit forever as the 4th car back. Every time I'm ready to pull out of line and give up we move ahead by one car. Then sit again... I would've sworn that one person was running everything inside but I get to the window (where I wait another 10min) and see half a dozen people sauntering about, laughing and having a great time. I pay and the cashier shoves the bag of food in my hand and shuts the window without saying a single word.  That was bad enough but I get home and find a PLASTIC BREAD CLIP in my sandwich!!!  Are you KIDDING me?!  I will never be back to this location. I'll gladly take that 30min and go literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"Just ordered a homestyle chicken sandwich.  Had bad lettuce on it.  Ordered large Dr Pepper.  Either the syrup ran out or it's not calibrated correctly.  There the soda out.  Rest of order was fine."}
{"text":"Usually good at serving, but today I found something in my green tea that looked like a loogie (snot). I threw it away right after taking a pic of it. Just gross if it is or not. Either way gross."}
{"text":"I was there today April 2,2017 at 4:10pm the store manager Carlos was using the cups with his hands to scoop ice into a cup instead of using a ice scoop. When I pointed it out he just said I am sorry. He had been handling money had not washed his hands between me and the car before me then stuck his hands in the ice machine. This was after he spilled the original Coke he made me down the side of my car with no offer of a carwash.  If this is what happens in view of people what happens in the kitchen no one can see."}
{"text":"The service here is mediocre. I work in fast food and I know it can be a pain to deal with rude people but when the costumer asks simple things there is no reason to be mean to them. I ordered a frosty and unfortunately didn't get the right size. We asked the worker if we could simply upgrade it to a larger size he sighed angrily and called over his manager. Didn't say anything the entire time but the total. He then handed the food to us very aggressively and me being the kind person I am I said thank you and he just began taking another order. If you don't take pride in where you work I advise you to look else where and not take it out on the costumers. First and last time I will come to this location. Shout out to Jesse for being rude though."}
{"text":"This location is usually super busy at lunch .. mean what location isnt during the lunch rush.  The drive thru is always 6 cars deep at least.  I am a fan of the grilled chicken sandwich.  Every now and then I will get the wrong chicken sandwich even after stating \"grilled\"chicken sandwich when I order but typically the orders are accurate.  I recommend double checking your bag.  I just got the power mediterranean salad (half) and it was good. I didn't even need dressing.  It was the less calories out of the selection of salads offered.  There were slices of grilled chicken, feta, tomatoes, chick peas etc.  For fast food ... it was a decent lunch.  Thanks Wendys."}
{"text":"The lady at the register was super friendly and most people at fast food restaurants are not as friendly. The food came out really fast as well. However, the food was a bit expensive compared to California."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's anywhere. Half hour wait in the drive thru every time. So ghetto--bad attitudes, uncaring employees. Never again."}
{"text":"There is a bug in my ice, frozen. I'm trying to reach you and no one is answering. Its ringing busy. I am very dissatisfied and disgusted by this service."}
{"text":"Huge improvement since the renovation. Better food, faster service, more organization and all around improved experience. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Even though I like Wendy's products, I would have to give there service 2 stars. I came to this location for my lunch break from work and when your out on the road as much as I am, your very grateful to be able to get to a restroom. This place don't even service there restrooms often like other places. I brought it to the attention of the cashier when I order my food and she said she would get someone to take care of it. I got my food, single burger, ghost pepper fries, and small drink. The ghost pepper fries is a waste of money if you like spicy food. It was just fries with cheese poured over it and some chopped raw jalapeños on it. Not spicy at all. Anyway after I finished my meal, went to used the restroom and it was still not serviced. Asked the cashier again, she said she would talked to the manager. Well my hour lunch is over so I'll find somewhere else to go. This was a total disappointment."}
{"text":"Everybody messes up an order from time to time but this Wendy's gets it wrong nearly half the time. Why do I go there? It's my closest restaurant. They hurt the Wendy's brand. If I finally get my order placed correct by the all-to-often new cashier. They then mess up the completion."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible! This place is super ratchet and ghetto. Customer service sucks. Just went there around 10:15 am and was told they didn't have any meat. I repeated what she said cause i was shocked that this establishment would even be open with no meat available. She basically reiterated that they did not have any. Didn't apologize for the inconvenience or anything. Such a waste of my time."}
{"text":"This location decides to close whenever they please. So when it says on their website that they are open til 1, they really close at 11. It's false advertisement. They say that that location is closed for cleaning. It's a joke.."}
{"text":"I've visited this location a few times and found the food and quality of service to be awful.  Burgers have been burned or overcooked, fries have been cold. In general I just don't recommend this location...  Wendy's is GOOD but you need to go to a different location to learn how good they are."}
{"text":"Wendy's in general is one of the top national chains. They have incredible chicken sandwiches (especially the spicy ones) and their more pricey burgers are borderline gourmet. Some of the burgers reach upwards of 7 dollars with tax but it's worth the money as the quality is that of what you'd expect from a pricey restaurant. Even the cheaper burgers have great quality of all ingredients.  As for this location... there are some downsides and some upsides.  Many reviewers on here point out flaws of fries being cold and burgers being dry... I was surprised these reviews until recently when I went at a different time then I normally do.  I usually go at 10PM or later for a quick \"lunch break\". Recently I went in the afternoon and noticed the fries were cold and hard and the burger was put together rather sloppily.  As for drive-thru performance (I usually use this method) they're usually extremely quick to have the food in your car and the demeanor of the employees is usually positive.  It seems their afternoon shifters are a bit shoddy. I'd recommend going here after hours or maybe give early mornings a try."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's around. The drink machine only had half of the selections, EVERYTHING was sticky to touch and service was slow and unmotivated. So bad!"}
{"text":"I love being yelled at in the drive thru when I'm trying to order. My god. When I order two combos and the person working can't remember what I'm getting. It's kind of frustrating. I arrive at 8:30 and was surprised to see a line of cars waiting, but after dealing with the staff, it's not hard to see why. I was shush and told to wait by the very aggressive drive thru person. I understand that people have bad days, but come on. I work in retail and I know what it's like to have annoying customers, but if you hate people as much as this worker does, maybe you shouldn't work with them so closely.  They gave me the wrong order that only had one sandwich. They asked what I was waiting for. I said I had another combo meal. They took back the bag and spent the next 3 minutes arguing with each other about what I had. They asked me what I had. I told them. And they started arguing again. Then I continued to wait while the line built up. What is going on here?"}
{"text":"We visited Wendys #2362 in Avalon, PA last night. We arrived and pulled into the drive-thru at 9:23PM. We got to the order screen around 9:31PM. I proceeded to start my order with 2 of the $1.99 Kids meals after 4PM. But instead I was told that the price is only good until 9PM. I told the drive-thru girl that there is no end time listed on the promo as I was looking at it right on the menu board. She proceeded to tell me that the \"PEOPLE\" told her I'm not allowed to get the discount. I asked what people she was referring to and was met with silence. We decided to just drive around and go in as she didn't know what she was talking about.  We entered the store at 9:33PM and went to the register. I again started my order with the $1.99 kids meals. To my surprise the cashier had no issue applying the discount. We ordered around $30 worth of food and stepped to the side to await our order. This is where it became troublesome. We kept waiting and waiting. And more guests came in and ordered. And then they were waiting as well. After 15 minutes one guest  went back up and requested a refund as they had to get going. The manager took her time getting to the front to refund the guest. No apology was offered to him at any point. Meanwhile we are still waiting. Half of the employees are standing around in the back doing nothing. One of them asked what was still being waited on. Another quiped back with \"Everything\" as he laughed.  It took over 30 minutes to complete our order by which time almost all the food was cold and the custom order was incorrect. The iced tea that we ordered was not fresh as well. Following the same standard no apology was offered and no reason was given for the lack of efficiency. This is not the first time that I have noticed this issue. However it seems to always happen with the same manager on duty. She doesn't care what her employees or doing."}
{"text":"This is a nice looking Wendy's both on the outside and inside. Everything about the appearance is fresh and new and the little artificial fireplace is nice.  Sadly the food is not any better than any other Wendy's and may even be a little less than average. It's OK for the price and when I feel like fast food I may opt for Wendy's, but in general I like to try to avoid it."}
{"text":"I tried the \"Jalapeno Fresco Chicken Sandwich\" and its a pretty tasty sandwich! !   It has the right amount of heat to it!!!    Wendy's is great for always adding new sandwiches to their menu!!  Keeping it fresh and new all the time. I love that!    One thing I realized is that the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger's have gotten a lot smaller.   I love the food but never cared for their ice tea.  It has a funky taste to it.    I love the new \"Jalapeno Fresco Chicken Sandwich\"  !!!  I had the ghost pepper fries.. they were good and had a nice kick - however .. there was too much cheese on them.. but still were good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch after a morning of shopping. I haven't been inside the new style Wendy's and I must say I was impressed. Definitely nice and unexpected from a fast food joint.   The staff was courteous and proficient and pretty much had our order ready the moment we paid. A manager checked it over, making sure we had everything we ordered.   Food came out great."}
{"text":"I've been to this Wendy's several times because it's close to work and convenient. But, after today, I doubt I'll be back. After waiting at the drive through for 20 minutes, with just 4 cars in front of me (it's always slow there, by the way), they finally took my money and said \"here ya go\".  No...sorry for the wait...nothing. I pull out and noticed the drink wasn't what I ordered. The lid was loose and spilled in my car.  When I took it inside, the girl at the counter proceeded to take another customer's order after she clearly saw me set my drink down on the counter.  She finally asked me what I wanted, I explained it wasn't what I ordered, which was a natural lemonade, not a Coke or whatever this was, and that the loosely applied lid popped off and it spilled in my car. Then she rudely asks me for the receipt.  I told her it was in my car, but really???  She brings me the drink and says \"here ya go...\"  Both times I was the one doing the thanking, which seems to be the common trend with fast food places these days."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague.  I spent 20 years in restaurant management and this is the most inefficiently run fast food joint in the area.  To say the service is slow is an understatement.  I have reached out to their customer service line twice and was told that someone would contact me regarding my complaint.  I have yet to hear from the GM or the district manager.  My most recent visit I noticed 3 employees outside the door smoking.  When I walked up to the counter, I noticed there was no one running the counter.  Someone came up to me and said they would find someone to help me.  this person proceeds to go outside and tell the 3 smokers that someone is at the counter.  All 3 come in (one is a manager) and NONE of them wash their hands.  Completely unacceptable.  Its too bad because I really like Wendy's.  But I will no longer be going to Wendy's in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"The food here is always really good. What I don't appreciate is the way the service staff behave when I come in. Yes, I'm fat and ordering a Baconator. My bad choices are your profit, so kindly roll your eyes a tad less."}
{"text":"After making me pull up at the drive thru & wait 15 minutes for a cold  Siracha chicken sandwich & cold Siracha fry, chili, & chicken sandwich everything was beyond dissapointing. I was told they are out of the spring mix salad for Siracha chicken but didn't expect a hard bun & cold sandwich. I asked several times for hot sauce & they still forgot it."}
{"text":"Aside from a short wait in the drive through, this was a very pleasant experience.  The staff was professional, letting us know it might be a minute. Not overly friendly, but poliet, which was nice.  The food was fresh, and orders were grouped together per each person's order."}
{"text":"While I'm always mindful that most chain restaurants offer similar experiences, the Wendy's at Royal Windsor near Ford Drive has seen better days.  This place exists in a dead zone between Mississauga and Oakville, tucked away in a plaza with a bunch of other no-name restaurants you won't remember driving past seconds later.  I've been coming here for years, and despite a reno job they did a few years back (which had the restaurant closed off-and-on for months), it doesn't look any better and the design is still hideously out-of-date. Walk into any other Wendy's in the city and you'll find polished interiors with the wall branding, do-it-yourself Coke machines and much better seating. Walk in here and you'll feel like you had a bad acid trip and went back to the early 90s.  The food is nothing to write home about, but every time I come here I see the weirdest people. Lots of redneck-looking folks, slobs and teens yelling loudly. Maybe it's just the mindset of the local area, but the other patrons almost always distract me when I'm trying to eat.  This is one of those places that's worth going to only if you have no other immediate options in the area. Otherwise, steer clear. It wouldn't surprise me if this place shuts down in a couple years."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the other bad reviews but I've never had a problem here. Wendy's is the only fast food burger place I eat at and I like this location the best. Their burgers and fries taste better to me than McDonald's or Burger King. Every time I've eaten here the cashiers are friendly and have never made a mistake with my order. Food is good. Tables are kept clean. That's all I need!"}
{"text":"Someone told me Wendys is a good place these days. I am eating the Mozarella salad. Quite good. A very economical and nutritious way to spend 470 calories."}
{"text":"I was using the drive through and the headset the employee was wearing was going in and out. It was quite frustrating and I asked if I could just order at the window. That's when someone else with a working headset came on to take my order. When she started taking my order I could hear the precious girl cursing me out to her manager. When I left a receipt was purposefully not given to me because they knew I had a terrible experience so I went back and got the receipt. The \"manager\" gave me a fake name of the employee who cursed me out."}
{"text":"The staff were super friendly and had the best manners I have seen from a fast food joint in all my days. Someone needs to promote Mitchell to upper mgmt ASAP this kid has talent!"}
{"text":"Just read the other reviews.  Super slow and employees on their cell phone in the kitchen instead of preparing food.  When i arrive, if I'm not at least the second person in line, i will leave.  You can bank on a 10 min wait to order and get you food even at being #2 in line."}
{"text":"I'm a little sad because I used to love it here but I guess it was because of one item. I live super close to this Wendy's and used to come here constantly for the spicy chicken nuggets. I was addicted. Those were my favorite. I would even order for the next day. I used to say I loved it here but I guess it was JUST because of the spicy chicken nuggets.  When they removed them from the menu it broke my heart.  I stopped coming for a few months until I got some coupons in the mail.  I ended up buying the spicy chicken sandwich to see if it was anything like the nuggets. I actually went back and told them they gave me the wrong one..they didn't. I don't see how it was \"spicy\" at all.  Then I bought a regular burger with the coupon. Buy one get one free. It was just fine.  I went again today for the Chicken tender deal and I honestly think it made me sick. The chicken tenders were not good at all. They are super rubbery. The fries were great lol.  I think this is my last time going. Super sad since I used to love it. If they ever come back with the spicy nuggets I will definitely be returning. Until then I'll stick to other places."}
{"text":"Dirty tables, food left on tables not cleaned up, dirty floors, overheard numerous orders being taken incorrectly, and.....well.....this place is dirty.  I get that this is Wendy's and not the Aria but damn."}
{"text":"Newly renovated modern decor and very clean.  The location is perfect for eating and shopping. There are many stores walking distance from high end retailers, shops for the pets or if you need a oil change.   You can even take in a movie."}
{"text":"Typical fast food fare Wendy's is a cut above McDonald's but definitely below Chick Fil-A.  This location is not all that different from most that I have been to.  What got my attention today and galled me is the lack of knowledge at these fast food restaurants to regarding their menu and how it affects people with special diets.   I don't expect everyone on the staff to have knowledge if an item is gluten free or not but I do expect there to be a least one person, especially after the cashiers spend 10 minutes tracking the manger down.  The ultimate response was check the website which did no good as the website had nothing on whether or not their Strawberry Fields Salad was gluten free.   Felt like we should have gone to Chick Fil-a that has Gluten Free options available."}
{"text":"Wendys hasn't been Wendys for years now. It is owned by Arbys. But either way this is a very good \"Wendys\". If anyone noticed, the food turned to crap awhile ago. If you are craving Wendys, this one is pretty much the cleanest in the area. The workers actually seem to care! This is my favorite Wendys."}
{"text":"The quality at this restaurant goes down as the day progresses. Their \"Quality is our recipe\" motto is only upheld when the food is cooked fresh in the morning. On my most recent trip the person at the drive through said that it would be a 6 minute wait to get my food. I told them that was fine. Specially if I was going to get fresh food. SO WRONG. The fry were old, cold, and had the worse flavor. They tasted like they had just been thrown in the microwave (and not even microwaved long enough). The chicken strips tasted like they were fried in old burnt oil. Other people that ordered food with me had the same disgusting experience."}
{"text":"They were all out of every caffeine free drink, ketchup was out and the ice was out. Guy with glasses on register clearly didn't like his job. Rolled his eyes and interrupted me multiple times. When they called out our order, it wasn't even fully done. Place is not great at all."}
{"text":"Takes 30 minutes just to order food.  Homeless people waltz in and out of bathroom.  Almost fell in the bathroom after homeless lady took a bath in the restroom sink.  One of my biggest regrets in life is coming here.  Next time I'll starve before coming in here.  Do not come here!!"}
{"text":"Pull it together Wendy's, you went from crap to awesome, but your chilly still sucks, it's 99% beans, and it's not even good beans..... Pull it together and pay up, add more beef to your chilly or change the name to bean stew..."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever! Waited 15 minutes and messed up my order but for waiting so long they gave us a free drink! Still though it was pretty bad! Don't go here. There is a better Wendy's at the intersection of Wilson mills and Richmond road! Go there!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's purposely gives you the jr patty in place of the normal one, when I first got my usual the Baconator from here I thought my burger was smaller than usual and only had 3 strips of bacon but i ate it and went I about my day, then later on I went to the Wendy's I usually go to in mesa and the burger was much bigger like I originally remembered and loaded with bacon, confirming that this Wendy's did in fact give me the jr and charge me for the the full, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured it was a mistake, but now I have gone to this Wendy's for the second time, ordered a Baconator and had my friend order a Son of Baconator separately and they gave us both the small jr burgers with 3 prices of bacon and was a little cold, DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY HERE, GO TO A REAL WENDYS THAT CARES ABOUT THE CUSTOMER AND NOT TRYING TO PULL A FAST ONE ON THEM TO SAVE EVERY PENNY THEY CAN, horrible business strategy, I will never spend another penny here and will continue to steer business away from this specific location, Wendy's is a great fast food chain but this one does not reflect the rest of the company and does not deserve to carry the title that is Wendy's"}
{"text":"Its fast food. Theyre fast and mind you I dont effin know how they know how im gonna pay but shit they always got my change ready with my other as soon as I pool up to the window. Whoever is the manager here youre doin a fine job."}
{"text":"Don't eat here, unless you can stomach a receipt in the salad. Terrible quality control."}
{"text":"They finally brought back the Jalapeno Fresco Spicy Chicken sandwich.  I have been missing these since last year and so glad I get to enjoy it again.  The chicken sandwich is spicy, the cheese is also spicy, and they add jalapenos.  I love spicy food and it was absolutely amazingly good.   Service was pretty fast and friendly and I am always a satisfied customer.  Hope they let this sandwich stick around for a minute so I can enjoy it again."}
{"text":"I think it's cool that they offer half salads.  I went through the drive through at lunch today and got a spicy Cesear half salad.  It was quick ordering and getting my food.  The salad was also good and not too spicy and just the right size for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Hate to write negative reviews, but this is a must. Undercooked chicken at Route 43, Kent, Ohio location. Spicy chicken sandwich. Bought between 10 and 11 pm I. May 5th, 2018. Never worked fast food, but thought they would have safeguards preventing employees from undercooking food; something that monitors time and temperature? Attached a picture of the clearly undercooked meat. I have not had this problem at any other Wendy's location."}
{"text":"I was happy that a Wendy's was at the airport and therefore I could eat some decent food, but my happiness was short-lived.  The prices here are astonishingly high. Now, I understand that airport food is always more expensive than not, but $5.69 for a cheeseburger seems slightly excessive for what you're getting. The best deal was the 5 piece crispy chicken nuggets at $2.49 each--nothing else was remotely worth noting from an inexpensive standpoint.  My low review--given my happiness with most fast food locations--stems from many factors.   Firstly, service. The service was fast, I guess as it should, but lacking any sort of human emotion...I guess as is normal for most airport places. I also did not receive any indication that grated cheese on my chili would be 30 cents extra, which would have been nice to warn me of (most Wendy's don't charge!).   Secondly, the food. The food was decent, but the standards just didn't seem as high as normal Wendy's locations. The burger was hastily put together and was a complete mess of mayo and ketchup with some pickles slopped in.   Third, accuracy. I clearly ordered--and I repeated and the cashier repeated--3 orders of the aforementioned nuggets, but ultimately I only received two (as was indicated on the receipt). That was a major bummer (when you don't get enough nuggets, your day is ruined). Plus, I also ordered the hamburger without cheese and without mayo, and lo and behold it came with not only mayo and cheese BUT ALSO bacon. It seems like they just completely mixed up sandwiches or something, and I feel kind of bad for the person expecting a bacon cheeseburger and instead getting a regular hamburger.  In the end, I could not believe that I was walking away from a Wendy's with a less-than-great experience. Wendy's is my go-to, and sadly, this one failed. In this case, what happens in Vegas DOESN'T stay in Vegas. The world must know that this Wendy's is lame."}
{"text":"Wendy's is one of the few burger joints I will visit. I never have burgers under the arches nor will I ever visit the King Burger place. Taste and quality is what brings me back time after time. This location delivered on both those points. The service was however not what I've come to expect. It was slow to respond to me at the walk-in counter. And the workers seemed to not be in a fluid connection as to who was doing what. They just weren't sure who was collating what orders and if some orders had been delivered. Nothing major and nothing of consequence that would prevent me from future visits."}
{"text":"I dropped by this Wendy's today as I had a craving for one of their chicken burgers (I know, I know). The first thing that I noticed was the SPEED of the people working behind the counter. There were 5 people in line ahead of me and I literally only waited for 20 seconds before being asked for my order.  I made the order and paid within another 20 seconds, and my food was out within 30 seconds flat. That's a total of just over a minute from walking to the line and my food being in my hand. Unbelievable!  The food itself was hot and fresh (unlike some other Wendy's I have been to). As for the taste, it's standard fare Wendy's and hit the spot. This review is more about the service itself, which matters a lot when you are in the Financial District, want a quick lunch and are pressed for time."}
{"text":"I have been to this wendy's 3 times this week every single time for lunch between the hours of 11-1 Iv spent 25 minutes between those three visits waiting to order due to a single register with a woman named Mandy. She is extremely slow and consistently has 5+ people in line. Food comes out slow and I have been told every visit sorry for the wait. If your sorry please start opening two registers and have an extra person in the back."}
{"text":"This was by far the worst time I've ever ordered food from this Wendy's I ordered three items and not a single one was correct very simple order no onions no tomatoes on the junior bacon cheeseburgers order of chicken nuggets with a couple of sauces and fries got two cheeseburgers with out bacon one with tomatoes and onions the other plane and two orders of fries but no chicken nuggets both gentleman at the teller window were rude and forgot all my sauce. I will never go back to that Wendy's."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru ordered my meal.I got halfway home and realized they gave me the wrong order.I went back and told them the situation the lady at the drive thru seemed more irritated than apologetic.I can understand the mistake but an apology goes a long way.I will never come back to this location again."}
{"text":"I agree. They are very very slow. I went there one time and I shall not return. I waited in line for about 20 minutes, and this was the drive thru. Not sure what the problem was, but it needs to be rectified."}
{"text":"This Wendy's location has definitely changed a lot since the last time I visited.  The dining room was renovated about a year ago (as of this writing), and it definitely feels a lot more put-together, fresh and overall classier than the \"old-fashioned\" setup they had before. There are slogans from Dave Thomas on a mural near the door, the branding definitely stands out more and the seating looks a lot nicer than what they had before.  The staff are also very good about delivering orders promptly, although I'm still not big on the whole \"give us a name and phone number for your order\" spiel. I usually just give them a fake name and number.  Considering that the restaurant is smack-dab in the middle of a lower-end strip mall, it still brings in a bit of riff-raff, but overall, it's a much better dining experience for families and anyone looking to stop in for a bite. The food's still just as good as it always is, and I usually stop in if I'm on my way somewhere in the area.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Decided to try out their fish sandwich.  It looked good on the commercial and thats about it.  McDonalds fish sandwich was better than this one.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Ok, drive thru was busy kudos to the two Girls on duty today at 9:45pm. Now I know why, the Frosty was only half filled and the fries were cold and seemed reheated soggy."}
{"text":"Wish i could put 2 ratings for different times of day. If you plan to come here anytime other than during lunch rush I would advise against it. During lunch your burgers and fries will be fresh and hot. Come at 7 pm and it's gonna be old and cold."}
{"text":"I will never buy food at that Wendy's again. Fries were old and cold, and customer service was the worst I've ever seen. If everyone hungry please don't to to Wendy's."}
{"text":"I want to give a shout out to this Wendy's. When in the area, I stop in here. Service is good and people are friendly. I am not a fan of most fast food places, but here I can get great salads and good coffee. Kudos to the management for the cleanliness and maintaining supply station. Employees are always busy keeping the place clean. Even the parking lot is clean."}
{"text":"This wendys gets the job done, its an older location and they don't have the new coke machines that you can customize your drink so that's a drawback. Overall the staff isn't the best and they tend to just want to get rid of you without even a hello or goodbye. But the food comes out quick and its close to work for me so ill have to settle."}
{"text":"Yep all true. I have been in this drive through for over 12 minutes. Still no food. Got the food finally and meat was warm and everything else oddly ice cold."}
{"text":"I have stopped at this location before. I'm very disappointed in the last two times I have tried giving it another chance. My chili on one visit less then 2 weeks ago was so hot that my daughter was done with her meal before I could even eat mine without burning my mouth. Now tonight my fries are not even cook all the way. Really!!! How hard is that?"}
{"text":"Wendy's is gross!  Unkept dining room, dead Flies all over the window frames, you can see the muck spread around on the tables, from using a dirty cleaning cloth. I do not eat here, I bring  my grandchildren here after school on occasion for fries and a frosty. When I was little, my mom would take me to Wendy's for fries and a frosty. I would dip the fries in the frosty and it was so delicious.  It was a great memory, so I'm trying to do the same for my grandkids.  However, Wendy's in general, but ESPECIALLY this location, seems to have turned into a disgusting, germ infested hole in the wall, with no consideration for quality, Cleanliness or customer service.  I guess things do change after 35 years!!  Yikes, I am so old.  So, if you people complain on YELP that the food is gross, it's because it IS gross. Even if they get your order correct, the food is STILL gross.  There are just too many fresh and healthy options in this day and age to pay good money (it's not cheap either) for inedible food."}
{"text":"Great service but....COLD FRIES. I hate cold fries. Dining room wasn't as clean as it should have been. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I like the salads and frosty from here that's about it. I like the chili every now and then."}
{"text":"I know it's fast food but the service here just wasn't very good compared to a regular Wendy's. Food presentation was sloppy, wait times were very long both for the line and waiting for your food. As always though, the food was fine. Have a great variety of affordable options for a quick lunch. Had the son of a baconator meal which was tasty. This location just needs better management."}
{"text":"New Renos make this Wendy's look like a giant bathroom. Food is fine. Staff is friendly and fairly efficient."}
{"text":"People working there are rude and unprofessional. Went there twice in past month only to get the order wrong. Will not be returning. Would think North Olmsted could hire some better people to work there. I wouldn't even give them one star but wanted to write this review."}
{"text":"I love Wendys.  Food was hot and fresh, staff was nice, no complaints.  Hit the spot to make me happy. :)"}
{"text":"I eat here on average 3 days a week.  Be careful when ordering a salad.  They consistently leave out ingredients."}
{"text":"Proximity to Target = win.  Otherwise this is your standard Wendy's.  Quick fast food service.  I always order off of the value menu.  Jr. Bacon cheeseburger, value fries, and depending on how hot it is outside a value Frosty or a value pop.  Oh!  They carry PEPSI products, not coke products here.  Blew my mind right out the window."}
{"text":"Should be ZERO stars!  This is the absolute WORST Wendy's is NC, I am sure of it.  They can't get the orders right, they can't give you a decent salad, and this time, not only is the bottom of the salad container quite visible, but the damn lid was cracked when I pulled it out of the bag.  The manager here needs to be removed, replaced, or flat out fired for allowing this type of service to happen. Ever since they moved back into their new facility, service sucks more than ever. Give me an older facility that will get my orders correct any day over the crap that is there now."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and order 3 #6s two kids meals with the cheeseburger meal. The lady asked us to move up forward and they would bring it to us. I thought that was ok since we ordered 5 meals total. I waited 15 minutes, then went inside to check the status. After asking and waiting approximately 5 more minutes we got our food. Hopped in the car and got on I-10 only to realize all 5 of our fries were cold and we got 1 nugget meal instead of two cheeseburger meals. Lesson learned! I guess fast food isn't fast and food in buckeye AZ"}
{"text":"Yes 5 stars.... Normally fast food joints dont impressme much but the lunch Team at this location has got it together...  I decided to dine in and was greeted right away. Then witnessed the team work... Nice Hawaiian lady shouted my order out as she took my money and by the time i received my change, my Chili and side salad where already on the tray. The young guy working behind her was on task.   Took my tray to the condiment area and it was stocked and clean.   For a fast food joint this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"I usually like Wendy's. I think that have some great burgers and who doesn't like a chocolate frosty. I really think it is just this location. Somehow the service is never that great and the food just isn't up to par with other locations.  The last time I was here, which will probably be the last time I am there, I had to wait quite awhile for my food. They managed to finally get half of it ready but were still having trouble getting the burger I ordered together. They finally got it together and I left to go back to work to eat where I discovered after all of that they gave me the wrong sandwich. Make me wait and still get it wrong. Boooooo.  At some point I will go back to Wendy's but never to this location. I will gladly drive the 2 extra miles to go to the one on Baseline."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time with my girlfriend back in May. I like Wendy's but there were a few issue. They never had the baked potato and they were not loud enough to call out the food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, horrible unseasoned food. I ordered last night around 7 pm pulled up to the drive through window the server said my total and that was it. I asked her how she was doing tonight and she shut the window in my face. I'm really glad I'm moving out of this area in a week this wendys has always been bad."}
{"text":"I was always a McDonalds person, the burgers are better out here. But this sweet thing that kid did for me made me a Wendy's person today, I told him I need a bag, he gave me a whole cardboard box, I swear that kid was so sweet, I then told him I just need a takeaway bag. My first yelp review goes out to you my friend. Cheers. You are the reason I'm becoming a Wendy's guy. I will edit this review the next time I come and ask for your name."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this location so I'm surprised by the reviews. I think I've dealt with some awkward cashiers but that's about it. Food is always cooked and safe to eat. Fast food joints vary by who works there! Although I can't wait for chickfila next year ;)"}
{"text":"Their listing says they are open until midnight. Showed up at 11:30 and they were closed. Waste of a 30 minute drive."}
{"text":"Has gotten a lot better keep your new managers they have gotten it right and hot the last 3 times I have been there.i have given bad reviews in recent it has changed keep it up keep the friendly kid in the window it's getting better. Thank you"}
{"text":"It doesn't even deserve 1 star. Worst food and customer service from the manager. I can't believe that such a big company as this one would employee such a disrespectful leader as the one at this store. Drive thru order is NEVER correct."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in months and came cause I wanted a great burger. My mother in law did too. The service was great from beginning to end, especially because we were taking a while deciding what we wanted. We got our food fast and fresh. Why did I ever stop coming here! Never again."}
{"text":"We used to go there quite a bit until the old lady behind the counter was a bit space out, she took our order and proceed to take the next order and in between she would hand out the food, my wife and me sat down an about 10 minutes, later we saw the person that order after we did was already eating so we wonder ?   I got up and went to the counter to ask whete was our food and the lady in a screaming tone said I lost your ticket what did you order? So at this time we were still waiting for our food and we were not getting serverd. We finally got our food and my wife was furious but she didn't say anything.  We went back a week later and my wife was on the mood for some nuggets so she got down an enter the restaurant about 15 minutes later she came back steaming the same old lady had taken her order and she did not gave my wife the food she was dispatching people who order after her, my wife confronted her and her escuse was that the other orders were smaller, and made her wait a bit more. When she arrived to the car I ask what is wrong she told me what had happen so I told her it's ok to calm her down and that she need it to call corporate so she did, we she spoke to the person they were apologetic and they told her some thing was going to be done after my wife laid into the corporate person.  3 days later my wife gets call from the store manager with another apology and to pretty  much justify the employee  for her actions my wife refuse to acknowledge  the manager apologies after all he was justifying  the employee,  in order Words calling my wife a lier I sincerely want to ask to any other customers  with the same or similar experience  to not to stay silent either call corporate or post it here so some thing is done.  And for the record we will not stop until something  is done about this crappie  customer service fats food joint and the poor management."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant 0 stars I would. Not only are the employees rude beyond all belief, they clearly have NO IDEA how to operate a food establishment. The food is often times cold. They don't cook made to order. And, they don't even ensure they give you the correct order. I'll never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"yeah - unfortunately - gotta agree with these reviews. This USE to be one of the better Wendy's - not sure what happened. I gotten to the point where I only order their salad now, there's no consisitency to the food that they \"cook\". But beware - they ALWAYS screw up the order - even the salad didnt have the dressing I asked for, geez! REALLY? Get it together Wendy's ...I love me some Whataburger!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start off with the man taking orders. If you're going to be at work, at least try to act like you want to be there... and it took almost 30 minutes for my take out order to be ready with an empty restaurant... customer service was garbage and Hopefully my food will make up for it.."}
{"text":"Noooooooooooooooo, they don't serve delicious Wendy's breakfast anymore! :( Very sad about that. Manager said the sales volume for breakfast was too low so owners had to cut it. What a shame."}
{"text":"They don't serve Dr.Pepper. Why else would you go to a fast food joint?   3 stars for their gluten free chili."}
{"text":"This place was opened about one year ago and I only got to try it recently. It is really nicely decorated, the interior design is very simple, vibrant, and cozy. I love the big TV screens that show their complete menu and the new items so you can decide what to get while waiting in lines.  The burgers taste amazing, the patties are meaty and juicy and their buns are really doughy and dense (somewhat similar to kaiser rolls), which adds a great texture. The French fries are amazing, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just how I like them. However, their poutine is very average with mediocre gravy.  The place is very tidy, and the service is really fast."}
{"text":"Walked in, and walked right back out. It smelled like the grease hadn't been changed in a very long time. Never had a Wendys smell like that."}
{"text":"I am rating this store 2 stars is because I like the salads.  Every single time I go through the drive through they always leave something out or its not even what I ordered. I normally let things roll off my shoulders but it's so incredibly irritating when you pay for something that you never receive because some of us don't have time to stop back through. I think McDonald's has gotten more orders correctly. Won't be returning to this location anymore."}
{"text":"My boss got salad there. Never had problems before.. she found a caterpillar in her salad.. all they did was refund for the salad.. how horrible is that? Ugh never returning again"}
{"text":"Justin our order taker at the front was very pleasant and I appreciated his kind demeanor after a long stressful work day. The restaurant sure has changed as it is very high tech and inviting. They even have a nice sitting area with a cool led fireplace. Thank you Justin and Wendy's."}
{"text":"So we are in the middle of moving. So we go to look at the menu and the girl at the cash is looking at us and making like psh sounds when we got our order they gave us 2 extra sandwiches free of charge. The good overall was hot and fresh I'm happy."}
{"text":"Man, fast food gets a bad wrap. Previous reviews led me to believe this place was going to get my order wrong while insulting my parents and kicking my dog. I got exactly what I ordered, and it was hot, fresh, and the workers legitimately seemed happy to work there.  Granted, this was at the tail end of the lunch hour, and this location is 24/7 (it's attached to the Pilot truck stop) so I can't make a judgement on the quality of food and service you'll get at 4:30 AM. I can say that it's definitely above-average fast food during regular business hours."}
{"text":"Missing a nugget. And burger had pickles regardless of request. Workers did however have time to talk about the football game. It was busy too about 3/4 full inside and a line of about 6 vehicles in drive thru.   I do feel that this Wendy's location is lower than the average local competitor fast foods and much lower when compared to other Wendy's. Sucks because its the only Wendy's serving this area.   If you encounter a problem I would highly suggest doing the survey. The information can be found on the back of your receipt. Likewise if you encounter an enjoyable experience by chance."}
{"text":"If I have to eat at the airport, I usually go to Wendy's.  Sure it's twice as expensive as a normal Wendy's, but it beats out the other restaurants here.  Employees are all friendly.  Plus you can get a free drink refill!!!"}
{"text":"Let's see....the food can take some time to come out even if you are the only customer. No one seems to wash their hands for anything. Filthy dining area which may have something to do with the filthy mop (and no bucket) being sloshed around. Extremely white trash/ghetto operation in both performance and especially in type of employees."}
{"text":"quick drive thru. drive thru kind of weird when its get crowded, its like two different lines from two different entry ways. Sometimes may be missing something from my salad, but pretty solid as far as Wendy's go. *shrug*"}
{"text":"We went thru the drive-thru at this Wendy's tonight. The order taker and the cashier were quite pleasant and appeared to be enjoying their jobs. The line of cars moved quickly. My order was accurate and I was charged the correct amount. We ordered two grilled chicken go-wraps, along with beverages. My wrap was fine, but the one in the kid's meals was totally unacceptable! The tortilla shell was dripping wet and appeared to have been dropped in a puddle of water! I was appalled that they would give something of this quality to a child! We took the piece of chicken out of it and threw the rest of it away. Unfortunately, I was unable to complain to the manager, since we had taken it home to eat."}
{"text":"We just wanted a couple frostys after eating at Olive Garden. There were a couple cars in the drive thru line, by the time we drove thru the parking lot to the drive thru, those cars had ordered and paid. I ordered, drove to the first window and paid then pulled up. The cashier had the two cars waiting for food pull up some, I was able to get my frostys and leave. Great customer service! for mgmt: This was Wednesday eve 10/5/16 at 5:55pm. names Jason and David are the names on the receipt. Kudos to them!"}
{"text":"The food is same as all Wendy's. The only issue I have is every time I use the drive-thru they forget part of my order, or a straw or sauce and always have to ask for it or park and go back in the store."}
{"text":"Waited from 10 minutes to order at drive thru and never received an answer from anyone. When trying to order it seems like no one wants to help or any one that is willing to pay for a good meal. I've been a customer for a long time and have been told that bacon was out when some of the menu has bacon on it that states that they have it on site. This shows to me pour management and customer service for any guest will to come to this location."}
{"text":"Normally I've not had an issue with this store late at night. But the last few nights it's been closed well before 1am as advertised in the window. I work overnights nearby and they've always been a decent choice for lunch but not anymore it seems. If you're going to close and stop serving food earlier, then please remove the \"Open 'til 1am\" sign from your window. False advertisement is no bueno."}
{"text":"Never really thought about writing a fast food review but I had to compliment the employees of this location. Took family on MLK day around lunch so it was crowded and the way the workers treated everyone was unbelievable. Just the friendliest hard working crew I've seen . Great job"}
{"text":"This location is close proximity to where I work. I was hesitant to come back and get another salad because the last time some of the greens were old. However, the manager was apologetic and of course got a fresh batch for me. Today's salad was fresh and on the spot with the dressing and bbq chicken on top. Some of the reviews gave this place \"bad services\" and I can see why. I'm giving this place 4 stars because I have no problems with their service except for that one bad salad I've got and most of the meals I've ordered here are better compare to other locations."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch 3-4 times a month. The food is good, usually better tasting burgers then your average fast food. I go here often for the variety of options (burgers, chicken, salads, baked potatoes, chili, etc). The staff is nice and the location is clean. During lunch they are usually pretty busy, the store only has 2 cash registers and there is usually only one employee taking orders. Once I put my order in the food comes out really fast which partly makes up for the long order line. Not really a negative but something to make note of is that they have only one of those new touch screen coke soda machines. It's nice to have but people are idiots and take forever to figure out what they want / how to use it. Another thing that is that their parking lot is terrible! They have maybe a dozen spots, other wise you have to park across the street, which is always blocked by cars waiting to take a left turn. Not really Wendy's fault just something to keep in mind if you are in a hurry. Overall good inexpensive (use the value menu!) fast food with a nice staff."}
{"text":"I completely understand that everyone has a bad day with that being said Josh and Hannah were amazing and rectifying a slightly not so pleasant experience that I had with my first visit ever to Wendy's. I would definitely be coming back to this location ! The asiago grilled chicken was very delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill and fast.    Every time I come here I end up missing half my order.   Poor service.  It's sad"}
{"text":"Uh yeah... I went in and there was nobody in the dinning area but It stunk so bad I look over and there was a homeless guy giving himself a perm! When I went up to order I told the cashier and he said the guy has been in there for a few hours and the manager said there was nothing she could do. I didn't want to eat in a dinning room with a guy giving himself a smelly perm! What the heck! Seriously this was the most weird experience with Wendy's ever especially in this location! I left! If they can't handle there homeless issue then I can't eat inside. I don't mind if the person was eating and being a customer but the guy was giving himself a freak relaxer in the store!"}
{"text":"I live approx. 1/3 mile from this Wendy's, and the bacon  cheeseburger I ordered and fries were stone cold when I got home.  They were absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the management screaming at their staff is a bit of a buzzkill.   Haven't had an issue foodwise, but the management team needs to brush up on their techniques. Sitting in the restaurant eating and hearing the managers scream at their staff in another language is not only extremely rude, it's upsetting to people trying to enjoy their food.   As far as cleanliness goes, the shared space seems to consistently cleaned and tidied."}
{"text":"This location is okay but most of the time when I come here the food sometimes is fresh and sometimes so it's hit and miss all though with that negative the customer service here is good the times ive come here and they do there best to get your food to you as fast as possible."}
{"text":"When I went to this location my entire order was incorrect. All four sandwiches and it wasn't even mistakes like incorrect toppings, I ordered 2 bacon cheeseburgers and somehow ended up with chicken. I called the store and was told by the manager on duty that nothing could be done so I went up to take all the food back and get a refund and was refused that until I said I would contact corporate. Then I was given a partial refund and when I contacted corporate I got a response from the district manager saying she thought I was lying until she contacted the manager. Customer service here is the biggest joke and if I go to Wendy's ever again I'll make sure it's not one in this franchise."}
{"text":"these 2 reviews are right on the money; i live in mint hill and HAVE to go to this one on the weekends if I want Wendys, and its a huge pain in the a-s because the service is AWFUL! Every day is like the 1st day it opened w/people running around like chickens w/their heads cut off. Inside is slow, drivethru is WORSE. And altho I've never seen it dirty-dirty I do notice that the floors seem to have an awful lot of trash them for no busier than the place is (they could easily have someone every cpl hrs wipe off the tops and quick sweep it."}
{"text":"Typical Wendys with a pissed off fat girl at the window giving attitude about having to work. Go back home and collect welfare vs being a terrible person at work."}
{"text":"Its always great fresh fries and two fatty burgers whenever I'm hungry I' love it and the drive thru is sketch but once u figure it out it isn't that bad"}
{"text":"The food is ok not the greatest, The fries can be very salty at times, The staff can be friendly but mostly rude your never greeted with a friendly smile. Never got their on a lunch rush because you will be standing in line waiting the entire or sitting in a drive through. Oh yea here is the funny thing I applied several years ago for a Job and the manager waited until I left and ripped up my application behind my back but also laughed at me.       This business is not worth the visit and the service."}
{"text":"Absolutely rude staff. Began arguing in front of us because one sweet girl let us in with 10 minutes before closing. They all began attacking her for doing her job. As we walked in they made \"are you kidding me faces\" at us and told us to leave. I hope that young lady who was working tonight gets promoted and they fire that awful manager and other staff members."}
{"text":"Your typical Wendy's.  Fruits were fresh, service was fast & everything was pleasant."}
{"text":"They have coke zero on the drive through menu, but it's \"only available for dine in\" according to the person working the window.   What the hell is that?   So stupid!"}
{"text":"Food is good, service and moods of staff are bad. I just don't understand how the management handles it."}
{"text":"Just another Wendy's...   This location is combined with a Tims. The service was quick and staff was friendly. There is plenty of seating and parking outside."}
{"text":"The employees make your order as soon as they hear it at the register. This makes orders go by pretty quick when it's a pretty small to decent order. Otherwise, a large order backs up the line far too much. Most of the employees there look really unhappy and I've witnessed arguements and even fighting, yes literal fist fights, between employees. The food is great usual, it's just the staff can really make or break the dinning experience."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment and I know it's the hired help, went to the 2858 Fish hatchery Rd. location here in Madison, WI during what must be the second shift at 17:16:49. I used to go there all the time for lunch and the Spicy Chicken sandwich rocked as well and the fries were perfect. Well this time I tried the Spicy Chicken Guacamole Club Combo...it was just downright nasty. At least the Chicken nuggets were ok, said my son. So on with my taste test...now mind you I love Wendy's I even own Stock in the Company which is more so why I feel like I was let down. The Chicken had resembled something that was under a 50 lb anvil, squished flat and over cooked, the fries were cold and soggy by the time we got got home. A 2.5 min drive home. Oh and my daughter that gave the order and payed the 16.64 bill was a bit upset and said wow are they rude. there you have it same place different shift...go figure."}
{"text":"I'm never coming back. My fries were cold and full of grease. The pop machine didn't mix the soda correctly.  All of the employees had nasty attitudes and were  incompetent."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and we had the cod sandwich. I thought it was very good and one of the better fast food fish sandwiches. This location was very clean inside and the service was very friendly. Nice place!"}
{"text":"The fish sandwich was soggy and not fresh. The double hamburger was not fresh. Very disappointed as I was hoping for a good meal. Will not be eating there again. If I could give less than a star I would."}
{"text":"Fast with friendly staff, but if you happen to go inside to eat it kindof stinks in there and there were flies everywhere !! The food has not been great, either. Probably wont be going here again"}
{"text":"Drive thru is pretty fast. Employees are attentive. They get our orders correctly everytime we ate there. Clean. Marko is good respectable man he works the drive thru window. You cant pay for kindness but all the employees are kind show appreciation people"}
{"text":"One star is generous. This dump deserves 0 stars. I go here often sadly because its the closest Wendy's to me. I'm forced to bring back my order multiple times a week for inaccuracy. Management here is ridiculous and doesn't care. Speak English instead of Spanish and you might get  orders out correctly. I got a refund today after attempting to call the restaurant a few times in which they didnt answer."}
{"text":"Went to this location a few times with my husband. We get chicken nuggets and baked potatos. The first time we went there they had run out of baked potatos. The man at the window seemed not to care and said the shift before him should have baked more for his shift. Why couldn't he bake one right then and there? We left with the other items we ordered. The second time we came back we decided to give them a second chance. Same story: no baked potatos. I can see not having baked potatos one day but two times in a row? C'mon now. We haven't been back since. It may be just a baked potato but I expect a restaurant to have menu items."}
{"text":"Typically if I go to this Wendy's they pull me over to wait behind a line of cars for food even if there's no one behind me. Last week they had no burgers and twice they didn't have a salad. I stop here because I live near by but often end up leaving to go to the one on Charleston because the quality, service, and timing far exceeds this Wendy's. Also, these trips are not end of night drive throughs."}
{"text":"My husband goes here a lot and hits the drive-through to pick up a chicken sandwich for my dinner - at least once every two weeks or so. I like the regular breaded chicken sandwich with cheese and extra lettuce and extra tomato. Often it ends up coming out with a ton of mayonnaise as well because they just put extra everything. I believe, however, that has more to do with the average fast-food worker as opposed to anything that might be lacking in this particular location. I really love their Strawberry Lemonade but at least 45% of the time the machine is either not working or they run out of the strawberry component of the drink.   This is a typically average fast-food restaurant."}
{"text":"The service at this place was hideous. I went through dive thru and waited an eternity. The cashier who appeared to be the manager did not offer an apology and quoted the wrong order. I know things happen but this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I enjoy comming here, usually very clean  except when the kids from the local catholic school dont clean up after themselves.  Food is always fresh and fries hot."}
{"text":"I just went used the drive thru window to pick up dinner. It has been quite awhile since I have been there and I doubt I will be back based on the service I received. The line was long. That was no ones fault. But once we finally pulled up to order, we weren't greeted. Nothing. No welcome to Wendy's ... Just a \"What can I get you. \" Then at the window she announced the total, handed us our drinks, didn't bother to ask if we needed a carrier, or if we wanted anything else and failed to even say Thank you. She closed the window and walked away. Thank you, Katlyn,( I believe that is your name.), for the terrible service. No smile, no graciousness. But you did greet the car behind us, so what the heck is up? We didn't even have a chance to speak and you were blew us off.  Now, I am home. The food is not up to its previous standards. The bacon is almost burnt, the fries were not cooked properly, and the new Chicken Tenders are gross. Please don't order their S'awesome sauce. The attempt to compete with Cain's is a failure. Also whoever packed our order gave us an order of nuggets we didn't pay for. The dog appreciated them, but someone else is missing their food because the lady at the window didn't check before she handed out the order."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Stood in line for 5 minutes trying to get a cup and I ended up walking away.  Great reminder why I never come here."}
{"text":"Just no. Cold nuggets, half cold burger, & salt lick fries. The ladies at the front could not get the orders together. One girl kept saying about an older lady that also works  there \"she's getting on my nerves.\" Gee thanks for sharing & btw, y'all are ALL getting on mine. The young girl also had a bunch of stuff in her hair. I seriously thought twice about leaving but I had a Doctors appointment & didn't have time to go any place else. Ughhhh why aren't they required to wear hair nets or something? I love Wendy's but this is by far the worst one I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I stop here near my house maybe 2 times a month and alway go to the drive through. The last 2 visits I encountered long wait times but the last time was 20 minutes. It was 5:30 PM but still...20 minutes? Burgers are alway good and hot but the fries are not fresh nor hot most of the times. A bunch of young kids working the dinner shift and they are nice and friendly but haven't a clue about FAST FOOD"}
{"text":"Drove through for an iced coffee and it is the most discussing coffee I've ever had. People are rude here too. My iced coffee was warm so I asked for it to be cold and she argued with me. I just wanted more ice. Didn't matter in the end. It's gross either way"}
{"text":"Used to get combos meals a lot, but lately I've only getting the food from the 99 cents menu.  All the hamburger portions are so tiny, don't really think it's worth the money eating here anymore.  Frosty drink is always good, no matter what size you get, I can never get enough of it."}
{"text":"Came to dine in at Wendy's and was greeted immediately and served with 3 min. The food was fresh and my order was accurate. What else can I ask from a fast food restaurant?"}
{"text":"Went to Wendy's tonight. I haven't been a big fan of theirs in the past but got sucked in by some new  advertising and decided to give them another chance. Ordered a couple double baconators and fry's with a chocolate frosty. I just want to say for the record, that for just under $7 a burger they should be embarrassed with this little, tasteless and dry excuse for fast food. Never again. I place Wendy's at the very bottom of the fast food burger race. Take my word, don't bother. $23 and totally unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Special thanks to Benjamin, who comped us 2 Frostys for the kids when we didn't realize that the ones that normally came with the kids meals counted as a drink. He wouldn't let me pay for them, and he also ran out a sandwich to us so we could start our meal. Great service! The food was good as always! We'll be back when visiting Tempe thanks to Benjamin!"}
{"text":"only come here a couple times a year, nice staff, men's bathroom wasn't very clean, out of paper towels, like the music they play in the dining room"}
{"text":"Best Wendy's I have been to as far as service  I only go a few times a year at lunch during the week  But fast , nice and consistent"}
{"text":"For those that think people only Post negative reviews  Two months ago I gave a glowing review of another Wendy's  This one  Horrible Waited 17 min for a sandwich and fries  Got to car  Looked in bag  Wrong sandwich Back inside  Waited another 12 min for a spicy chicken  Got to car again  Got to work  Still wrong sandwich   Horrible Slow Would never go back"}
{"text":"If you guys are going to make every car pull over and wait for their food at least put some salt and ketchup in the damn bag for them.  The grilled chicken sandwich had warped hot lettuce. I want my money back."}
{"text":"The Wendy's on Cochran road is literally the worst franchise I've ever encountered.  The service in the location is terrible.  The restaurant is dirty. The operator of this location should lose his franchise over how bad this location is managed.  It's pathetic."}
{"text":"Terrible place and terrible employees. Me and my friends go here all the time after school when we are hungry, it's within walking distance. The manager is unprofessional and so are the rest of the employees. On certain days when we don't order food, they tell us we have to leave and make up an excuse about it. Truth is, this guy has some thing against teenagers. To top it off, they aren't even professional about it. The African American manager tells us to leave and proceeds to say \"Get out! Peace out! DEUCES!!!\" Like seriously? Don't go here, they're all prejudice and unprofessional. If only I could rate it zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"This Wendy's sucks balls! Got a Jr bacon cheeseburger. Towards the end of burger there was hair or string in and on my burger. The string could have been from someone's clothing & the wind made it land on my burger. I go up & ask for a refund for the burger because who knows how much string I already ate! The manager gives me no problems & gives me a refund. However the worker had something to say, in hush hush tones of course;bothered that I asked for a refund for a burger that was dirty."}
{"text":"It's okay. Fry portions are small. Customer service is robotic. On my last visit my bun had ketchup soaked into the bottom. Soggy buns are the worst."}
{"text":"food is good, quick delivery, good price. was able to sit and relax while eating my food. Cashiers were friendly and brought me my food within minutes of ordering which was good."}
{"text":"Wendy's is typically very consistent, but not at this location.  The restaurant was dirty, the staff was unfriendly.  We were the only people ordering and it took around 10 minutes to get our food.  When we did, the fries were cold and soggy.  I'll never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"When I pay $7 freakin dollars for a salad I want LETTUCE!!!!!!! I am so sick and tired of these fast food chains ripping off the consumer with shorting the dang lettuce. Fill my salad with lettuce or slash the price in half! ITS LETTUCE!!"}
{"text":"Everytime I have been here the staff is very friendly and the food is good. Sometimes they are slow with the service and always double check to make sure that they gave you all your food (a few times they forgot some of my food). The only warning I have is don't go here after school let's out during the school year because it gets ridiculously packed."}
{"text":"I would like to give them four stars but unless you pay careful attention to your order there is a very good chance they will screw it up.  I don't get a good vibe from the staff either, I have yet to have real bad service but I get the impression they don't really care.  That's fast food.....  I only go back for a few reasons.  The quality of food is slightly better than McDonald's and BK, my son loves it AND you can substitute chili for fries."}
{"text":"Ick. Their panini's aren't what the used to be and the Caramel Roaster was way too sweet!  Now I've never been to this location before now so maybe this is consistent for them. But I receive much better quality from Wendy's in the east valley, Mesa/Gilbert area.  The service was nice and the drive thru attendant was very patient with my questions. For that, I am appreciative."}
{"text":"Fresh. Hot. Fast. Drive-thru had GREAT customer service.  I don't know what to say about the previous reviews. Perhaps this location had a management change for the better."}
{"text":"Used to get combos meals a lot, but lately I've only getting the food from the 99 cents menu.  All the hamburger portions are so tiny, don't really think it's worth the money eating here anymore.  Frosty drink is always good, no matter what size you get, I can never get enough of it."}
{"text":"I don't think there has been ONE time I received all the food I paid for in their drive-thru?  They go through employees like toilet paper.  Although, they usually have better fries than the rest of the Wendy's."}
{"text":"Had to comment about the service I enjoyed here.  They were friendly,  funny,  and pleasant,  things you don't usually experiEnce with fast food.  They came to my table to make sure everything was ok.  The food was what you'd expect,  except the fries were cold."}
{"text":"There is a cashier who is the most awesome woman ever. She is super excited every time I walk in, and makes me feel like the best customer ever. I will find out her name the next time I go, but she is the epitome of great customer service.   The only other thing I have to say is that their soda dispenser is space age Star Trek awesome technology. You pick the type of drink you want, and any additives, and it is AMAZING. Touch-screen awesome drink magic."}
{"text":"Well, if you enjoy eating subpar, overpriced food, this is the perfect place for you! It's quite frustrating when you pay $5 for a chicken sandwich, and you end up getting a half-assed burger that was hastily put together.  Rather than waste your money, go to In 'N Out, or a more reputable burger joint."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday... wanted a nice lunch with my wife... we got baconators!!  Not good ... they advertise 6 strips of bacon... we only got 4... the burger meat was very dry... we were not happy!! No more for us...."}
{"text":"Lol this place is a FAIL every time! If you go at night when it's dark the drive-thru menu board is off so you can't see! And they close at 11pm I went there at 10:45 they did not want to answer the drive thru. The staff are horrible, they don't care about customer service. I would go to any other Wendy's but this one!!!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is a joke. Tonya the so called manager is very unprofessional and rude. When you go thru the drive thru at any restuarant there is a possibility that you might receive the wrong order. No big deal right? Just go back and let them know so they can give you the right order. When I went back to let Tonya know that I must have innocently received the wrong order, she proceeds to scream at me. I told her that mistakes are possible and that no one is perfect. She argues with me for close to 5 minutes and then eventually gives in and remakes my order. She then tells me that I am taking time away from helping other customers. Well newsflash, if I received the correct order in the first place I'd have no reason to come back. After she replaced my order she refused to return my receipt to me. The receipt has valuable information about contacting the General Manager and District Manager with any complaints. She didn't want to give me my receipt back because she feared that I would inform her superiors about how she is treating their valuable loyal customers. I had to snatch the receipt from her hands. This upset her so she then proceeds to write my license plate number down as if I had done something wrong. Regardless to whether this order was remade or not, the receipt is still my property. I paid for a good/service and I am entitled to a receipt under Arizona state law. I will be contacting Wendy's corporate office and the franchise owner directly in writing. To be treated this way by a drive thru employee is unacceptable. To be treated this way by a Wendy's employee is despicable. I have never had a problem at any Wendy's location. This experience has absolutely blown my mind. I will not continue to support the Wendy's mission. There are loads of restaurants in the area. I choose Wendy's because it is usually a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The cheeseburgers I get here are always room temp so the cheese isn't even melted :/ yet the French are scorching hot and EVERY single time I get chocolate waffle cones in the drive thru they try to just hand them to me as is in no cup, I have to ask every time, As well as constantly being stingy with the ketchup packets, even if I spend 20.00"}
{"text":"Getting home and realizing they only gave you 3 ketchups for your 3 full meals, and no sauce for the nuggets...so frustrating. we told you at the speaker and the window. We were the only people in the drive thru. Get it together!! Your job is not that difficult."}
{"text":"Instead of throwing away cold food they thinks it's okay to hand it to the drive thru customers who won't be able to complain because they are gone before they realize the issue. Check your bags  I sent my cold limp fries back and was told by rude window girl.ro pull forward. They gave me the same cold fries back. Had to again ask for fresh ones. Drive thru at your own risk."}
{"text":"Came to this Wendy's on 1/14/17 a little after 12am. We were in the process of ordering when a black car pulled in front of us. The woman over the intercom told us to hold, which was fine...however the Wendy's employee was having a argument with the people in the car over an order mistake but the food was already half eaten. The employee said she would only fix this one time and called them \"Ughhhh these F*#%kin Beaners\" I was so outraged because this is the type of people Wendy's hire and the employee is clearly racists. I'm not Mexican but my boyfriend is and I did not want anything from this establishment. I'm not sure why the employee left her mic on but the language no matter how the situation was, was definitely inappropriate. I wanted to speak with the Manager but my boyfriend said I was making it a big deal. I don't tolerate such language since I am a woman of color as well. I'm highly disappointed in Wendy's and I will not support this specific restaurant any longer.  Go here if you want to hear racist remarks."}
{"text":"The service here was absolutely horrible!!! They told me to pull up and it'd be a four minute wait it was actually sixteen minutes!!! When I finally got my food it wasn't even what I wanted!!! Thank goodness there's a mcdonalds next door!!! I wish I could give this Wendy's less than one star. I'm not happy."}
{"text":"This Wendy's used to be so good.  Wendy's in general used to be good.  Dave is probably rolling in his grave right now.  Wendy is nothing more than a pimped out fast food prostitute, the life torn from her, all over the dollar.  Not only is the food not good anymore at pretty much any Wendy's, but the quality of service is severely lacking at this one and most in general.  Like most fast food places to me now (which I rarely eat at because of the decline in quality) it's better to go within the few hours of opening.  The foods fresh(er) and the staff doesn't hate the world just yet.  This location isn't even worth visiting just because it's on the main drag.  They need to inject some quality control into the management, employees and food or Wendy's will be the new Rally's."}
{"text":"This is the Wendys that made me never want to eat at Wendy's ever again.  To think I gave it a second a third and even a FOURTH try!  I guess convenience gets dollars but after so long, you'll stop getting mine.  The employees here are always fighting when you go in about shift changed and duties and the attitude carries itself right over to the register.  The management isn't any better telling me to go somewhere else if I don't like it then.  This place is the reason people scoff at giving $15 a hr to fast food employees.  The frosty is never frosty always runny.  The burgers are slapped together and the dining room looks more like a daycare after a long day than a place you would want to sit down and eat.  The only good thing about this place is the exit so you can swiftly leave and never come back."}
{"text":"Just waited a good 15 minutes in a drive-thru and 10 of those minutes were behind the car that was at the speaker. When we decided to leave, they hadn't even begun to take their order.  Doing your job isn't this difficult, guys.  There's literally no excuse to leave a car at the speaker that long without taking their order."}
{"text":"This place use to be decently clean, but now they have gone down hill. When I walked in there was a few tables that had trash on it still. This store really needs to remodel to the new Wendy's here in the valley. Plus the costumer service could be better, it seems like the employees don't even want to be here, it would explain why they are looking for a new manager and crew members.   I'll still come here, just not inside to eat."}
{"text":"This Wendys just happen to be remodeled and my girlfriend and I decided to stop in and take a look at the new design of the store. the remodel has changed how you order and pick up now you order at one area and pick up another the dining room area has been completely remodeled with new tables new atmosphere and even a small ones area oh and boot there is wifi."}
{"text":"I like Wendy's and I think their food is generally better than the bunch, but this location is BAAAAD.  Don't get me wrong, the employees are friendly and try to be helpful, but there are two large problems with this location; the employees lack training and 50% of my orders come out wrong.    Wendy's mails coupons to my home, and often this location hands out coupons with orders, but EVERY time I went to use a coupon at this location, they have no idea how to enter it.  They almost always say their don't have the button on their cash register for it, but I have to believe its poor training, or a complete lack of any training.  Second, at least 50% of the time, the order I get is wrong. At the drivethru I'm almost always missing at least one item which I don't discover until I get home.  In the store, items are wrong as well.  Again, lack of any training seems to be the problem, and a high employee turnover at this location also seems like a problem."}
{"text":"Airport Wendy's. You curbed my hunger. That was all I needed from you. The fries aren't tuuuurible, but I loaded them with salt and pepper and dipped away in ketchup. Wendy's you should probably have some tables, but I get it... you're in a tight place and I can just go eat at my gate. Which I did, but there were no tables at my gate so it became very awkward eating fries out of the bag off the ground while balancing a soda between my legs and holding a book in one hand and a burger in the other. Yes, I would like more tables, but this is an airport problem. Wendy's, you also reminded me that you've always been better than McDonald's and Burger King. You're okay in my book Wendy's."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service , Angel is a very affable cashier . I come here with my brother every week . Food quality is good. Juicy and fresh hamburgers . I love Wendy's !"}
{"text":"This Wendy's location is extremely shady. I don't even care for Wendy's I only go for their Apple pecan chicken salad, specifically their candied pecans.   I come to this location because its close to my office..  The owners / workers here are very shady.   If you go to McDonald's and ask them for extra BBQ sauce for your nuggets ..they will give it to you, even if they charge extra that's fine.  This Wendy's location refuses to give you extra pecans ..I ask for 2 extra pecan packets while I'm ordering, insist I'll pay extra for them, they say ok.. Drive up to the window and no extra pecans to be found, I ask where are the pecans and they said they started charging for extra pecans ..??? Umm didn't I just say I'll pay extra for them ..???? Then the owner comes out and says we will give them to you for free this time, but next time you have to pay..umm wtf???okay?? That same week I went back and got the same salad at night, completely different people working..and I didn't run into this problem .. .. This has happened the past 4 times I came to this location during the day  ..what's really weird about this location is that they do not punch in your order in the cash register ..you get no receipt ! Make sure you ask for a receipt when you go here , I have a feeling they screw multiple people over daily.  Just be careful when you go here  This may seem like a silly issue, but when you go to other Wendy's locations and don't receive consistent service and policies , it just makes everything weird and shady !! My last time here"}
{"text":"Walked over this morning (for breakfast )while my car was getting serviced at a nearby JiffyLube.  Door was open, lights were on, and 3 people in the back.  Stood there for 10 minutes hoping someone would take my order.  ALL 3 people made eye contact with me and IGNORED me.    One of the workers eventually came thru the entry door and saw me (again) still standing there.    Him:  sorry we're not open  Me:  but the door is open and your lights on  Him:  no we're not open."}
{"text":"Stopped to get some lunch and added a coffee at the very last minute and they gave me the coffee free.  Service is awesome!"}
{"text":"I had a good experience here. I was in the mood for some of their chili.  I am not ashamed to say that I always enjoy Wendy's chili! Pretty darn good.  Since it was just me, I went through the drive through to take lunch home.  The lady taking my order could have picked up a personality on the way to work today...  but I'm guessing maybe it's just been a long day for her. Otherwise the drive through went pretty smooth and quick.  I saw they had new flatbread sandwiches.  Guess I might as well try one right?!  I chose the Smokey Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken option... of course with my chili on the side.  On their sign in the drive through, it states the sandwich is only 370 calories and 22 g of protein!  Sure!  I'll give it a whirl!  It was a smaller chicken sandwich but that's probably why only 370 calories.  But it did have a great flavor with the smokey honey mustard sauce.  The flatbread was great also with grains baked in which gave it a great flavor.  Like I stated earlier, I always enjoy their chili.  It's always hot and tasty.  And a small cup of chili is actually pretty filling for me.  You can get onions and cheese added to the top if you want that option.  I'm not one to turn down cheese!  Yummy.    A good and quick lunch for me from Wendy's today! Yep, I'd get their flatbread sandwich again."}
{"text":"Literally a bunch of old lady morons. Waited 15 minutes and they filled about 11 others people's orders who ordered AFTER me. They didn't even realize they skipped my order and only did because everyone else was GONE and I was staring these idiots down. No wonder these broads work here. Absolutely no brains. They deserve less than minimum wage. Can't even handle fast food."}
{"text":"The food is great, the people are nice.  But every single time- EVERY SINGLE TIME I ask for no cheese on my hamburger, they put cheese on it. It's not fair! I get home, open my bag, and see a burger I cannot eat. When somebody says no cheese LISTEN to them. I've learned I need to check my burger every time I start to pull away from this specific Wendy's window."}
{"text":"The drive through cashier's attitude. She act as if she was doing me a favor and she was annoyed by my prescience. The manager apologized."}
{"text":"Service is about what you'd expect. Food is what you'd expect. Weird parking lot set up."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Wendy's but this location is a good one. The kids I take care of wanted this for dinner and I went through the drive thru. I could hear clearly, the man took my order correctly and I got everything I ordered in the bag. I had to park and run in because one kid decided he wanted a drink after the order was already complete. The inside was clean and the man (Wesley) that took my order was so nice and friendly! Definitely made me me smile and if I ever feel like going to Wendy's, it will be to this location :)"}
{"text":"Dear manager,   Went through the drive-thru at 10.30 Saturday night. I asked for chill cheese fries and the woman said it will be an hour .... not sure how that's even possible at a fast food place. I let out a laugh at the irony of waiting an hour for fast food. She then said \"i don't see the humor\", then when asked what she said in shock of awful customer service she then started going off about how she did say it and this and that with much attitude.   I drove off- the owner will never be getting my money."}
{"text":"I can build a jumbo jet faster than they can make my iced coffee... Been here for over 15 minutes now.  Sure they are just having a rough day."}
{"text":"If there was an option for less than one star I would choose it. This is by far the worst Wendy's and the worst fast food restaurant I have ever been too. Unfortunately this is very close to my home. I've been here at least a dozen times. Always rude service. Once walked in the store only to witness a cashier screaming at a customer when the customer pointed out they gave him the wrong burger. My experience was  similar that night. Today at noon, had a rude man in his late teens or early 20s basically rush me through my order, then he kinda tossed the food to me when I paid, didn't say a word. The burgers were dry and room temperature. The buns were stale. The Fry's were cold and soggy. Never again, I will never go to this Wendy's again. Sure if I go in they'll give me a coupon or something. Been there, done that.  It's a consistent issue and there are many options near by."}
{"text":"Pretty much the slowest service I've ever received at a drive through. I am still waiting on my food and it has been at least 30 minutes. Not sure if they are understaffed, poorly managed (or both). Either way whoever is running this place needs to get their act together."}
{"text":"Would've given five stars had they not been so skimpy on their crackers. The chili was excellent as usual, but when I ran out of crackers... I went back and asked for more... you would've thought I was asking for their firstborn child..."}
{"text":"No customer service what so ever. They act like they are doing me a favor by even taking my order. Too many Wendy's out there to ever go back to this one."}
{"text":"This might be the worst Wendy's I have ever been to. They just don't get it. You need a token to use the restroom. The staff is clueless. Dave Thomas is rolling over in his grave!!!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't come here for a while because they were going through a remodel and I have issues with places that stay open during certain construction. There was scaffolding all around the building I just had visions of drywall dust in my food so I had to pass until about a month after the remodel to make sure the dust had settled. I might eat garbage but it has to be dust free good garbage.   My wife has been wanting to try the new pretzel pub chicken sandwich so we headed over with coupons in had. I had a BOGO coupon for any of the chicken sandwiches so we ordered 2 of those so we both could try one and then my hungry ass ordered a daves hot n juicy, cheesy cheddar burger, jr cheeseburger deluxe (for the dog) and some chili cheese fries. The pretzel chicken pub sandwich was very good and the thick slice of muenster cheese really stood out... but the pretzel bun didn't. The pretzel bun was very soft but lacked any pretzel flavor. If you are going to put \"pretzel\" in the name of a product it really should taste like it! The daves hot n juicy is my favorite here these days. I just get the single 1/4 lb and with the fresh veggies on it and it really hits the spot. The burgers here are fresh and never frozen. They also fresh cook bacon. My chili cheese fries were a good 3.5 stars.  I saw they have frostys in a waffle cone now. Nifty."}
{"text":"This Wendy's location is usually our go to place after spending time at the lake or river when we're tired and starving. We typically go through the drive thru and have never had any complaints. Once we get to the window the employees always make sure we get what we need and we never have to request it. Somehow they just magically know  their customers need napkins, spoons, straws, etc!  They're all very friendly and don't just hand you your bag of food and close the window immediately. We don't get that kind of customer service at San Tan Valley or Queen Creek fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"The wendy's at grandcanyon national parks is by far the best in the nation.  But the wendy's at phx airport is the worst I've ever had. I ordered a number 2 and that is exactly what the burger tasted like. There was so much salt  on the fries that I could not eat them. My advice to anyone who might be thinking of eating there don't do it.  Dana Daniels  dtd9881@gmail.com"}
{"text":"IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS I WOULD! The worst customer service ever. We went through the drive through and asked for a moment to decide what we wanted and in not even two minutes we had been asked 4 times if we were ready. Until finally the male and female speaking told us we needed to come inside and look at the menu if we would take any more time. When we got inside another woman was talking to the manager about THE SAME ISSUE. I understand there is a timer but when is it ok to ever rush the customer?"}
{"text":"Had to add this location. Have always had good luck with the food and service here. Their \"Deluxe Bacon Burger\" is really good (double is better!). A frequent stop for my wife to get a Frosty."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. While visiting this location, the fountain drink machine essentially exploded on my daughter who is nine years old and sprayed orange dye all over one of her favorite shirts. When I spoke to the manager-Brian-he told me \"it's not our problem, we lease those machines\". When I asked him if he was seriously addressing a significant customer concern that way, he said \"yes, there's nothing we can do for you\". After repeating this exchange multiple times due to my amazement, he shrugged and walked off. I called their customer service hotline to report the incident and they told me they would report it to Management and call me back for details... four days later, they have yet to return my call.  Avoid this restaurant at all costs. And did I mention... It's probably one of the dirtiest restaurants I have ever been in."}
{"text":"CASE BRIEF: Based on my short visit, this Wendy's unit appears to be one of their more-poorly maintained, so you may want to ski-daddle on down to another.  THE FACTS OF THE CASE: I meandered in here to kill a bit of time before my nearby eye exam. My order included a fountain drink from the Coke Freestyle machine. Amazing, this machine, that it delivers so many, many flavors from which to choose.  But when I tried to tap a diet-drink, ALL of the fifty or so diet-buttons were grayed out, unavailable. I went to the counter and informed the manager. He said something like \"Oh, I could get you ...\" The rest was a weak mutter. I said \"I'll just get an unsweet tea.\"  I kept a close eye on Mr. Freestyle to see what management would actually do about the problem. For the thirty minutes I was on-spot, there he stood, tall on his stubbly legs, his back proudly arched, his torso protruding, ready-to-serve. But he was entirely ignored, left alone, never given a single drop of attention. The whole thing, it was as if Mr. Freestyle was a pimply, introverted nerd at Junior Prom.  Thirty-six hours later I paid a sympathy visit to Mr. Freestyle, on the pretext of actually choosing to eat Wendy's product without any mitigating circumstance in-place. I checked Mr. Freestyle's buttons. More than half of the diet drinks were still unavailable. In fact, of the forty-or-so top-level buttons for ALL drinks, about half were also unavailable. Despite this enduring rejection, Mr. Freestyle held stoic, flashing his white button at top-right, on-and-off, constantly begging for management's help. To no avail.  I would guess the reality of this soda machine is that it is constantly out of all kinds of syrup ... because the manager hasn't got enough managerial sense to advance-order enough syrup stock BEFORE it will be needed. So I have to wonder what managerial sense he uses to ensure product preparation and sanitary expectations.  I reported this travesty of justice to Wendy's top corporate executives, who surely read & congress every message the instant it arrives at TalkToWendys dot com. So, even as I write this, they likely have sent the Nevada National Guard to take control of this crisis. And started bleeding red ink all over this manager's performance evaluation documents. Yeah, right.   I also advised TalkToWendys that, as a veteran Wendy's employee, I was pretty sure that the successful vending of hamburgers and chicken sandwiches is heavily dependent upon the availability of beverages in tandem. In case these executives do not comprehend why a desert-dry soda machine, in a desert city in the summertime, might have some negative impact upon revenue.  [ Actually I am not sure whether or not I was ever an employee of Wendy's at all. I worked there when I was an undergraduate ...  for about 2.5 hours. After watching some training videos and being dressed-up like a candy-cane, I was parachuted into the lunch-time kitchen war-zone, where I experienced several painful scaldings from the French-fry oil ... and the verbally-abusive kitchen manager. So I asked for permission to step outside for a smoke ... and never returned. Since I didn't get a W-2, I assume my entire employment history there was expunged from every stone and tablet, as is done to a detested Egyptian pharaoh. ]  FINDINGS: If you are diabetic (such as I), this place is a potential death-trap. For the rest of you, hit up a fast-food unit that actually has beverages. Court dismissed.  UPDATE/COURT OF APPEALS: Two months later, being in the neighborhood, I decided I was owed the use of this Wendy's restroom - without a purchase - then checked on the condition of Mr. Freestyle. I wasn't surprised. Just under half of the top-level beverage options/buttons were unavailable for use."}
{"text":"So I get a salad from Wendy's but it had a little something \"extra\" in it....totally grossed out!! I want my money back and never will I buy another salad from here!!!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru the kept some of my food items all together through many visits to this Wendy's I'll never go there again"}
{"text":"Horrific. I went to Wendy's at 11:20 AM for lunch so there should be no excuse for poor quality food as the restaurant should be prepared for lunch service. I ordered a taco salad and when I arrived home I opened the cup of \"chili\" to discover hot red water- pure liquid. 2 small crumbles of meat and 3-4 beans. I called the restaurant and the phone rang off the hook. Called the 1-800 number and was told I'd receive a call. It's 9pm, glad I didn't hold my breath. Who in their right mind would pour liquid into a cup and expect a customer to pour that over their salad? Won't be back"}
{"text":"I have always had good experiences here- the burgers, chicken sandwich, fries, and chili are good. The quality seems better than McDonalds."}
{"text":"Went to grab a burger on Christmas Eve. The window sticker clearly said they close at 7pm on Christmas Eve. We pulled up to the drive thru at 6:25pm and no one responded. We pulled up to the window with no one there. Then we went to the door to go inside and the door was locked. When you say you close at 7pm, then that means you need to close at 7pm. Not 6:25pm."}
{"text":"For some reason I feel compelled to praise this Wendy's location.  The staff here has their sh*t together! I come here for lunch usually once sometimes twice a week, orders are prompt, friendly and never any errors (driver-thru), EVER! I've never been to a fast food location that has never made a mistake on an order, except for this location. I can tell my selection is made-to-order and made consistent! Great job to all the hard workers here!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I have ever had. The line of cars for the drive thru was into the street yet when we got our food everything was cold. Nothing was fresh. The night crew obviously does not care to do their jobs and provide any kind of good service or decent food."}
{"text":"Spent 12 dollars for some burgers fries and nuggets. Pay over 2 bucks for a french fry and they can't even fill up the dam box. Look in the bag to expect some fell out the top maybe. NOPE, worst portion of fries in my life for the price and I eat out alot more than the normal person for over 20 years. SMH, guess you can't go thru the drive thru and expect good service anymore."}
{"text":"Ok so I have been to one, yes only one wendys thats is great. U fortunately its in el paso. This location just serves food that seems as though it has been sitting in a warmer before you get served. I get the pretzel cheeseburger and the two times I've ordered it, the bun has been hard/stale,  the burger is not juicy at all,  and usually everything is nowhere on the bun and is all over the box. Same goes for the new bbq burgers, for $4 something the burger is a sad excuse. The burger is a mess and everything was all over the burger box, same goes for the other burgers. To me its crazy, I understand time is money but some companies need to grasp quality control and remember how they did things in thw first place to get to where they are now. If you are going to sacrifice quality for quantity with poor craftsmanship then ill move on to the next fast food burger place that does. Ill recommend passing on this wendys and give someplace else your business as in my opinion wendys doesn't care of what product you get."}
{"text":"Upon parking, my boyfriend and I planned to go to Wedny's, eat, and then go into Savers just across the parking lot afterward. We were going to MOVE our car after eating since it is a tow-away zone if you park in your parking lot then go into another store. When we got out of our car, a male worker (appeared to be a manager) yelled at us from ACROSS the parking lot and asked us what we planned on doing in an extremely rude tone. After I pointed that I planned to go to Wendy's because I wasn't going to yell back, my boyfriend and I changed our mind because we both felt that the yelling at us from across the parking lot was extremely rude and unwelcoming. So, we moved our car and went shopping first instead, then decided to eat somewhere else.   Yelling at customers from across your parking lot does not make them want to come into your restaurant. I wish I had thought to use a different fingers to hold up to him."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive-thru to bring lunch to my parents who live down the street. 8 items ordered and paid for but only got 7 items. Didn't notice until I was at my parents' place that the employee didn't give me my cheeseburger. I chose to spend time with my parents without my cheeseburger rather than driving all the way back to Wendy's for someone else's mistake. I'm very unhappy"}
{"text":"Food is Wendy's--not amazing but not bad. The inside is always dirty and you'll see the occasional homeless man camping out in a corner. Staff seems friendly enough, but not the brightest people."}
{"text":"Good fast food for a good price.  I miss the cheesy cheddar burger. Bring it back!  The employees are all kids so sometimes they get your order wrong but they'll fix it if you catch it before driving away."}
{"text":"Can't even get an order correct. Employees here are rude as hell too. I hate this location. 10/10 avoid"}
{"text":"The drive through line was pretty long so we went inside to order food. The main reason why we went was to get the Frosty coupon books for my daughter's friends on Halloween. The cashier said they did not carry the books until December. Meanwhile, there are signs posted everywhere about the Frosty coupon books. My daughter was hungry, so I also ordered her some food. It took about 16 minutes to receive her food, which was a kid's meal. During this time, the cashier walked away for about 10 or so minutes. A long line started to form to order, and the manager had to take over the register, as well as prep food orders. For the price of the food and fancier decor, I expect more."}
{"text":"I usually drive-thru this Wendy's but this particular day I didn't feel like waiting in the long line that seemed never-ending lin, so I went in. First, this Wendy's is huge compared to others, and it's really nice inside. However, it's not clean. I couldn't believe that I was pulling my drink lid from a metal sever that had disgusting stains and hair on it. The condiment table was equally nasty with loose lids and ketchup. The dining area did not appear that clean either. Lastly, they have those wonderful virtual soda machines, but many of the options were unavailable. Let's just say I'll probably be sticking to the drive-thru from now on."}
{"text":"This Wendy's can be a hit or a miss. I usually order from the drive thru, and there usually seems to be some kind of line no matter when I go. They are not fast by any means. I've seen a lot of the reviews that said they got their orders wrong, but that hasn't been my experience thus far. I recently ate inside this one, and the updated decor was nice and the space was pretty clean. The frosty and fries were lackluster; my frosty could've have been easily sipped from a straw and the fries were not fresh. Like I said, hit or miss, it all depends on the day."}
{"text":"It's your typical Wendy's fast food restaurant, don't expect too much of it.  Great location right next to Loop 202 near Chandler/Gilbert area.  Lots of other restaurants to try out.  Well maintenance restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here few times before and after they remodel the place.  Now they have a fireplace and it's usually always on during winter time.  Okay location.  First thought they might open 24/7 but later they close rather early.  We need a place here that opens up 24 hours a day.  The only food I like getting here is the frosty.  The portion of their burgers are so tiny and the meat feels like it has been frozen before, not good."}
{"text":"I was about to give this wendy a glowing 5 star review and I got home in my burger was cold so four star review it is. I have visited this Wendy's several times most of the time for a late night Munchie runs and it very rarely disappoints. I normally get the number one with extra lettuce that seems to be a good mix of cheese burger and vegetables I try to take it easy on the French fries since those are not too healthy and a chocolate frosty because that's what the munchies are all about. I would suggest that if you see a long drive thru line you just go inside because the drive-thru line can be a bit of a wait if you are in the back of it. My dog is staring at me right now waiting for me to finish the cheeseburger so hopefully she can get some, but I doubt it!"}
{"text":"Eat ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE! The cashier was rude,  the manager looked a mess and tree food was all old and terrible! Seriously,  if the manager let's this happen,  maybe it's time to replace them! Worst Wendy's I've ever been to."}
{"text":"First I go to through the drive thru see A employee out side  smoking pull to the next window he walks in and get straight on the grill without washing his hands then the food they gave me the patties was raw in middle SMH"}
{"text":"Its been a year since my last review, this location is doing as good job as they can but the new menu is falling flat.  Bring the classics back.  Please."}
{"text":"This location is fine.  My complaint is for corporate. Corporate, please bring back the old burgers. I can't stand the sweet pickles and red onions and the natural fries I miss the old Wendy's and from the empty stores I Drive by It looks like most everyone else misses the old Wendy's too. Maybe bring back a classic line of the original burgers and fries?  Wendys used to be a regular stop for me and my work friends but now we avoid it like the plague."}
{"text":"Poorly managed. Went in for a burger. Stood in line behind 3 guys. Indifferent counter employee took first guy's order, stood there, then wandered away. I waited 3 more minutes, no counter activity for any customers. I left to get a crummy burger at McD's where they do provide you service at least. Ridiculous \"service\""}
{"text":"Well, another poor experience.  Some of the was ready in a reasonable amount of time,  but it sat on the counter for over 10 minutes while we waited on the final sandwich.  So we sent the fries back because they were cold. The missing sandwich finally showed up. Rest of the food was cold at this point. No manager to explain what was happening.  Nothing.  We try to avoid this Wendy's when ever possible. You should too."}
{"text":"I literally just ordered through the drive through a 4 for 4$ and got a cheeseburger with it. The cheeseburger was cold and rotten!! I mean it smelled really bad. I took a bite and almost puked. If I get food poisoning from that bite I swear I will sue this place!!!!"}
{"text":"This WAS our go to Wendy's until yesterday. The staff is so unprofessional I was shocked. I told the girl the first thing I needed and she said \"A whhhattt?\" I repeated what I said and again no drink and she says OK like a rude bitch and I just was staring at the screen wondering if she really spoke to me like that. I said, you know, you don't need to be rude it's unprofessional. She was then shocked and laughed and then said \"ma'am, I'm not being rude!\" Oh so that's your customer service? Told her to get effed and backed outta the drive through while some sloppy, scraggly employee stood in the doorway staring at me. When we were there a few weeks ago, someone had their headset on and started saying \"Polly wanna cracker\" and I said ummm what and another employee yelled is your headset on and it went quiet then someone comes on laughing while taking my order. Like, wtf?! Not to mention your trying to order and they assume you want a coke and that's not even wtf we want or I try ordering multiple meals and after the first one they say, your total is......This place needs some serious help with customer service and we will never return to this one. Went to the one on Litchfield and what's weird is, their drinks are bigger!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite and stopped in today hoping for their flatbread and was super disappointed that they no longer have them!   Oh well, stick to my good ol' standby...chicken nuggets and fries!    I arrived a little before the lunch rush, both my fresh fries and chicken nuggets were hot...as it just prepared!!! Oh yeah!!!   Service was fast and the cashier was friendly. That's it! Short and sweet.   I'll be back to this location, but based on the previous reviews I'll make sure to never go at night!"}
{"text":"I went back a couple of weeks ago for 50 cent Frostys, since my kids were insisting.  Apparently the kids meals are $1.99 after 4pm, as well.  The food was still sub-par but for the money it was food...I don't remember Wendy's burgers being quite so DRY, and the new pickles they've been using the last few years are rather disgusting...  SO anyways, I went to pay with a gift card I had picked up at Fry's for some fuel points, and they said they CAN'T take gift cards at this location and won't be able to until their new location is built.  Umm, really?!  Wendy's still finds new ways to disappoint, even when you're already anticipating sub-par food.  This location should be considered an embarrassment for this chain."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price :) i was very pleased. AMAZING service from jamal with a beautiful smile and he was so patient with us. Even brought the food to our table! Thanks Jamal!"}
{"text":"Disgusting !!!!! food cold, employees rude as hell and don't want to be there ! Don't eat here !"}
{"text":"I like Wendy's a lot, though in the airport you have limited options, so I go to Wendy's out of liking and necessity. I have never had trouble with their food or Frosty's on my trips."}
{"text":"Orders always wrong, and cold.  Go to the one @ graham and rt 8.  They do a consistently better job."}
{"text":"This is the closest Wendy's to my house, which is unfortunate. I'll drive a little further to have my food made correctly. I special order things without mayo because I can't stand it. 80% of the time there is mayo all over it. Other things in the order are constantly messed up too. Last time I went they didn't even have any spoons for the chili."}
{"text":"This location is consistently at there worst. Slow service and poor quality of produce used on sandwiches and salads. Certainly don't expect any customer service either. Spoke with Eli the assistant manager and he was of no help, then he tried to match wits with me, sincerely unappreciated. Stay away."}
{"text":"Good and speedy services.  You now need a token to use the restrooms."}
{"text":"Interesting pricing on this Wendy's. I suppose that is to be expected at an airport though. So I will forgive it.   The food here was surprisingly good for fast food. The fries were hot and fresh. I ordered a double. It was good. And huge. When they say half pound they mean that."}
{"text":"Best Wendy's experience I've ever had! And I wouldn't normally take the time to review fast food. We went just after midnight following a long and tiring day of moving. The idea was to hit up the Eat'N'Park over by Giant Eagle, but alas, they were closed.  We pulled into the drive thru, and were immediately greeted. Needed a minute to figure out the order and they waited patiently. Also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered, which we were. We pulled up and there were 3 young men working the window. They were moving quickly, smiling, and paying attention to what they were doing. We got our drinks and paid, and then I asked if I should move up since we were waiting and there were other cars behind us.  We waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally FLOURISHES our 3 bags of food at us. I mean, presentation AND style? At a fast food drive-thru at midnight? So cool. He was funny, attentive, and totally made our night. I don't even LIKE Wendy's that much, but I will definitely be back, and soon."}
{"text":"This location doesn't have the magic drink machine or even a self serve drink machine at all. Otherwise, standard Wendy's."}
{"text":"Their service really is subpar. I might just be a fat animal but I feel like their spicy chicken patties (funny word...you just don't get to use \"patties\" enough) are always on the skimpy side. Anyways...It's also a franchised location so it's more expensive and they close at 11PM not 1AM."}
{"text":"Visited through the drive-thru today, ordered a double stack and a small french fry, the girl at the drive-thru just looked at me when I pulled up , not say a word, handed me my food, took my card, gave me back my card. I had to say thank you for her to respond, when I arrive home to eat my food, My Double Stack is a single cheeseburger with no napkin and no receipt so I called the store, the manager was very friendly, apologized several times and offered to replace my food. I just wanted her to know what was wrong with my order so that she can retrain her horrible customer service skilled drive-thru girl. The two stars is for the manager."}
{"text":"I had vowed never to return to this location after having 2 horrible experiences there. They recently re-opened, so I was convinced to give it a try again. WOW!! what a difference. Everyone was very friendly, drive thru was fast, and I was pleasantly surprised. I will return and hope they keep up with the positive change!"}
{"text":"Terrible service been in the drive thru a whole 30 minutes. Pull up to the winds and the staff is playing around having fun not working.DO. NOT GO HERE  unless you have time to spare."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location on Saturday afternoon to try the new Cod Fish sandwich and a wild berry lemonade.   I didn't go in so this review will be solely based on my drive thru experience.   Customer service was top notch!! I placed my order quickly, the guy confirmed my order and then thanked me for ordering! When I got to the window we had some small talk and it was all very pleasant!   The sandwich was good,  the fish was crispy and hot. I passed on the lettuce and tarter sauce...but it was still pretty tasty. The fries were not so good. They were warm...and just not very appetizing so I didn't get to finish them. But the mixed berry lemonade was cool and refreshing. The berry flavor was not too sweet and a good compliment with the lemonade.  Overall, it was a quick and decent meal. It's just like any other Wendy's!"}
{"text":"This one says drive thru open late but for some reason is always closed around 11-12, also the food sucks. Last time i got a wrap from there and i couldnt even eat it i threw it in the trash, this wendys is the worst"}
{"text":"Love the renovation!! But the drive thru line tends to be super slow lately around lunch and dinner especially, so be prepared for a serious wait unless you go inside. Maybe they'll make some new hires soon to speed things along"}
{"text":"This Wendy's location is horrible! Burgers are cold and so are the nuggets. What happened to customer service? I'm going to have to take my complaint to corporate. If you call into the location and complain they don't offer to do much of anything. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This place is slower than slow. Forget trying to enjoy your food on a lunch break."}
{"text":"I went to get a taco salad because I heard so many wonderful things about it. The service was fast and the product was fresh. The customer service could have been better. The cashier didn't smile nor did she say thank you."}
{"text":"My 4 yr old and I picked up my 6 yr old from school and went there for lunch today. They both had nuggets and fries. 30 mins later both had projectile vomit. Just plain wrong"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had ordered 2 jr bacon cheeseburgers, a number 10 ( chicken nugget meal) and they asked if we needed any sauce. The guys who were at the window were chit chatting away while giving us our food. We got our food and drink and noticed there wasn't any sauce so we went around the drive thru to get the sauce. We get home and found our order totally wrong. We had 2 cheeseburgers with everything on them except bacon. There were 2 large fries but no chicken nuggets at all. Usually this Wendy's is pretty good but after that experience I will never go back to that Wendy's again."}
{"text":"I asked them to cook my food fresh and they had me wait 20 minutes and my order was cold. I have given this place way to many chances and now I have had it. This really is the worst Wendy's around and the employees are a bunch of assholes with bad attitudes."}
{"text":"Experienced the worst drive thru experience.  Started to order, was interrupted by the employee, asking me to start over and laughing over the intercom.  I finally was able to get my order placed, a number ten (chicken nuggets), then i was asked if i wanted to make the meal a medium (as i had asked that the drink be made a medium) and I said yes.    When I got to the window, the same person who took my order, greeted me with \"you had a large drink, right\"?  I calmly replied that I had ordered a medium drink as she had asked me if i wanted the whole meal medium.  She seemed confused and then said \"oh, okay\".  Then she came back and handed me my credit card back, and they tried to hand me a small drink (from a different girl).  I corrected her and said I had a medium drink.  Again confused, she looked to the girl who took my order and i finally asked, \"well what was I charged for?\"  She replied, \" a small\", \"then give me a small\" i reply.  Additionally, i was asked what sauce for my nuggets, i replied with Ranch.  When i get home, i realize that I received no ranch, the nuggets are the spicy kind (which i didnt ask for nor was I asked about) and the quality is less than had they been sitting around from the previous day.  Employees that work in this wendys need a serious retraining or to move on elsewhere."}
{"text":"Every time I try to get a baked potato they are out. We were told they take 1/2 hour to bake. At 5:00 dinner hour you'd think they'd make extra. The staff are not friendly and the service is soo slow!!  Also when dining-in the staff were cleaning and spraying cleaner right next to my food. Unappetizing."}
{"text":"It's nice to know that we can pay for cold food at the driveway window. Then when you send an email to the address at the bottom of the receipt for complaints or comments to the general manager, you never hear back from anyone."}
{"text":"I wish i could give this location 0 stars. The indian manager is RUDE. I had a cupon to use and he told me I made them up. Then he said dont bring your fake money here. I work my ass off and dont need to be told by a rude worker that I have fake money and cupons. Ill take my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"The great advertising for a cod sandwich is fine if you like ground cod and a very flat, hard sandwich. Well over priced at around $5.00!  We went to Wendy's a couple of times a month prior to this but no more."}
{"text":"I have never been to a better run Wendy's in my life I did a lot of fast food and I've never had a more attentive staff they really seem to care about making your order correct I know based on my review it seem like I work there something but I really think that they're the best run fast food restaurant in Parma the manager seems like you 20 years old but he really goes out of his way to make sure that you have all the condiments you would like I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"The person at the cash register was friendly and he knew what he was doing, but unfortunately there was only one cash register in the store. We had to wait on line about 15 minutes just to place our order, though once we ordered the food came quickly. The burger was above-average for fast food places."}
{"text":"Their staff absolutely crushes it. Customer service is off the charts for fast food. Food came out hot and fresh - standard Wendy's date done well."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. There were hardly any customer and you would think it was a lunch time rush, only no food was coming out.  What is the purpose of going to fast food if it takes forever.  By the time we got food, burgers were cold but we're afraid to complain and wait for yet another cold burger.  Definitely in need of some management help. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"The staff seems to change frequently with is a usual thing in fast food.  Wendy's can't figure out their drink policy, it keeps changing all the time.  First, they will refill your drinks with the original cup.  Next, they changed it to not touching your cup (makes sense) but then getting a new cup for you.  So we never know what it is going to be on our next visit.  It would be so much easier for them to turn the drink dispenser around for self serve but then I am sure they are saving cost on the syrup for the drinks.   Sometimes their new staff have issues with using the register and getting an order correct even after you repeated it a couple of times.  Their new heads-up register, one can now see what they are ordering you.   Last, I know its 100 degrees out but why must I have to bring a jacket in to keep warm while I eat inside?  The workers need it cool cause they are around the grill and moving around but to freeze out the customer????  Funny part was the manager passed by and asked if I was too cold.... I guess she noticed my shivering."}
{"text":"Sat in the drive through for close to 15 mins, no one came onto the speaker to take our order. Had a long line behind us, so we just pulled forward and when we got to the window, no one seemed to notice that we hadn't been helped yet. This was the worst drive through experience I've had. I will remove the negative review if i am contacted to make it right."}
{"text":"I usually don't eat at fast food chains, only when I have a coupon, which I did for this visit. It was a coupon from the mail for 2 for $5, which is pretty decent for the amount of food you actually get.  My experience though didn't start off too great. Once I walked in, a PUTRID smell hit me like a brick and I honestly gagged (I threw up a little in my mouth, sorry tmi but just being honest.)  We asked for some hot sauce, but instead got packets of chili oil that tasted way too salty and foul--my tastebuds died along with my nostrils from the restaurant's smell.  It was a very unpleasant visit, I think next time I have a coupon I'll drive a couple more miles for a more decent location."}
{"text":"Horrible IDIOT working the drive thru tonight!! Ordered a large meal and didn't receive drink or fries... The food was a 3/10.. Will not be going back to Wendy's, EVER ... Management should think about reevaluating your staff and get the orders right !! If you wanted a tip, you should work for it, not steal it from customers LOSER.."}
{"text":"I've had some pretty bad customer service here before, but now you guys are pulling out shotguns and shooting at customers?  What the hell?  I cruise by this location some evenings and stop by when hungry.  The drivethru wait is extremely time consuming.  The person working the window normally not pleasant(there is one nice one).  Also, plenty of other smaller things worth noting including cleanliness, but this week takes the cake.  I came by trying to get a spicy chicken and all of a sudden police started coming from everywhere.  One of the employees had pulled out a shotgun and shot up a customers car.  WOW!  I really don't know what else to say about this.  That said, I might still stop by.  Bojangles and subway are just as slow and unfriendly, and they aren't open as late."}
{"text":"Nice location.  Really nice folks working here.  Bathroom was needing attention as it was pretty thrashed.  Not the cleanest Wendy's around so not likely to return any time soon.  Dave Thomas is probably turning over in his grave.  Quick update:  I was really impressed with the person at the counter being so nice to the biggest loser customer who kept complaining about her order, insisted on using multiple coupons, and made them remake several items.  I would have lost my temper with the customer from Hell."}
{"text":"It's a typical Wendy's. It's hidden in the corner so be sure to look to your right as soon as you get off the highway.  I stopped in for a quick lunch. I ordered the new Smokey Honey Mustard flat bread with fries and a strawberry lemonade.  It was full on lunch rush, so the drive thru was packed. To avoid the wait, I opted to go inside. The place was clean; but unfortunately for me it was still packed with people! But the good news is that they were very well staffed to accommodate the hungry lunch crowd.   After I ordered my food, it was ready pretty quickly. I actually really enjoyed the entire meal! It's a multi-grain flat bread so it adds really good flavors. I've had a lot of flat bread from other places but this one is by far one of my favorites. The chicken and spring mix combined with the honey mustard had a really had a great taste. The honey mustard wasn't too sweet which I was really pleased with, and just like the name said it added a great smokey flavor.  There was just the right amount of everything on this sandwich and the best part was that the french fries were hot. And I'm really starting to become a fan of their strawberry lemonades. It's the regular lemonade but with really a delicious strawberry syrup mix. No need to say anything more than it's delicious!   Overall, it was a solid visit and meal. I enjoyed everything and I'm sure to be back."}
{"text":"Today I was in a hurry, so I decided to opt for FAST food.  Wendy's hit the mark.  Quick order process, quick payment process, and by the time I hit the window my order was handed to me.  It was even a special request. Everything was hot and fresh and just how I ordered it. Good job Wendys!"}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru and ordered a Dave's single, add bacon, no onion w/ extra pickles. The server was polite and respectful and the young man who delivered the order through the window was also respectful and greeted me pleasantly. The Dave's single was like it came right off the TV screen out of a Wendy's commercial. Fresh ingredients and made perfectly to order. I was so impressed that I called and asked for a manager just to say how happy I was with the experience and the product. There's enough complaining in the world to depress and discourage the masses, however, I thought it entirely necessary and in perfect order to make that call and to write this review. Good service and orders made well deserve to be recognized. - and with that I say \"Thank You\" to the staff working at the Wendy's Restaurant #5102, during the hour of 4:48pm EDT on Saturday, February 3rd 2018. I sing my praises to the team and associates. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Dave's Single w/ cheese and Xtra Pickles and add bacon - receipt reflected the Xtra pickle and the charge for the Bacon ($0.80). They just threw a single from the warmer in the bag. I went inside and waited in line to let them know they charged me for the bacon but didn't add it (if they forgot the bacon but didn't charge I'd forget about it, I always just let it slide when I'm not charged). From the moment I was in line I grew very perturbed and impatient at the young lady who kept sneering and rolling her eyes that I was in line with my receipt and burger in hand (she was the one working the register inside). Once they seen me from the back and knew why I was in there I told them I didn't want it it remade just refunded the $0.80. However, I was not appreciating the young lady's attitude that kept rolling her eyes at me. I just walked out while they were speaking back and forth trying to figure out how they were supposed to refund the money. I did not just throw a \"one star rating\" on this experience because I still at my burger and enjoyed it - I love Wendy's burgers. However, customer treatment, ethics and decency are huge IMHO. You WON this round Wendy's! You got my money (only $0.80) and kept your product (the bacon) AND got away with disrespecting a customer - touché Fast Food industry!"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars, I would.  This place has nothing going for it.  It is filthy, even for a fast food place.  There were gnats and flies everywhere and everything was just old, dingy, and obviously has not been taken care of.  Aside from the decor, the service is terrible too.  We tried to go this evening and despite the fact that there were at least 5 or 6 people working, it took them 15 minutes to serve two customers.  Instead of placing the order and then moving on to the next person the cashier was running around like a chicken with its head cut off.  She couldn't work the register and complained loudly the whole time.  After standing in line for 15 minutes and only having two people get served, we left and went down the street to Arby's."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it always seems like there are never enough people working to be able to serve the customers in in a timely fashion. Saturday about 8:30pm they only had three people one working the drive thru, one on the counter and one make the food for both. The guy making the food was slow. Guy on the counter was New an needed help and girl in drive thru gave no guidance when she was asked. They should never have less than five people at this location. I should never have to wait 25 minute for my order."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Thursday night around 8:30. This may be the worst crew at a Wendy's I have ever seen. The floor was covered in food. The ice machines were spitting water, the ketchup containers were empty (you had to go to the counter to get packets, wonder why they just didn't put the packets by the containers?). There were at least 8 staff and meals took forever. I saw my two burgers come out to the counter, but apparently the french fries weren't ready. By the time I got my meal the hamburgers were cold. One guy finally came out to start cleaning, but he was also the cashier! I would suggest avoiding this place until the manager gets his staff together."}
{"text":"I'm right behind everyone else that has left a review. Pretty much feel like they need to shut down and start over with a new staff and better attitude. You're working in a new restaurant treat it like one. Our food order took forever..... like a really long time before we ordered then when we did it took forever to get the food. The line stays long not because they are busy but more like SLOW. They don't listen or repeat the orders back. You have to request the same condiments more than once. They'll shut the windows when they are done so good luck getting anything you need if it's not in the bag. We asked for a cup of water after spending more than $30 bucks she pretended not to hear us threes times. Let's just say i never got my water .... I'm still thinking about that water I was so thirsty. We just finished moving after a long week I just wanted a burger and a water to celebrate. Damn .... still thinking about that water"}
{"text":"The other reviews were pretty spot on.  For drive-thru, you'd be better off just ordering inside. Ordered the 4 for $4 and the worker took my order perfectly and when I eventually made it to the pickup window, they gave me the right order.  Reasoning behind the 2/5 star rating would be the time factor and the food overall. Can't get much wrong with the 4 for $4 deal, but the fries were not only unfortunately undercooked, but incredibly salty. It shouldn't sound like raindrops when you remove the salt from ONE single fry. I get it, they use sea salt, but it's never been to this extent.   If you can, I'd say drive the extra miles for a different location. I'm usually down to give each place two tries, but if it's a fast food chain, shouldn't be the case.   (This location does NOT have a freestyle coke machine)"}
{"text":"This place is extremely dirty and the food is cold along with my Fry's being burnt.  The staff dis smile but that was to probably cover up for the bad service."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's in the area, rude cashiers (mainly girl with robe on her head)  that basically threw the food out the window at me, Especially don't appreciate hearing \"is this food for this bitch\" before getting handed food. Recommend getting a new crew. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch with my boyfriend and grandma. I want to say that Kaila the cashier inside is UTTERLY RUDE. She is not polite at all, she does not take orders in a timely fashion and she gives attitude to guests. I witnessed the lady in front of us in line ask her if the tray was her food and she said \" uh yeah\" in the rudest voice and rolled her eyes. We ordered a simple 4 for $4, spicy Caesar half salad, potato, and chicken wrap. We waited over 15 minutes for our food which to me is a bit ridiculous simply because we were the second people in line. The more and more I frequent this Wendy's the more I realize they have terrible time management and poor costumer service."}
{"text":"Had a .99 Ceasar wrap, on the 2nd bite I found I was chewing on a foriegn object,  found a plastic \"kwik lock\" from one of the bags their buns came in.  Took it back, manager was polite and offered me a replacement, but by then my appetite was ruined. Later I got angry when I realized I could have chocked to death. Wrote a letter to Wendys and did not hear a thing."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just need a French fries and frosty fix. But most of the time, this is a good chain to hit up for chili for lunch. Or their portabella melt, that was actually surprisingly delish.  But this location, man. I ordered one of their over-priced fancy entrée salads, and the portion was more of a side salad than an entrée but still set me back like $5. A little ridiculous considering they don't offer hardly any other \"healthy\" options on their menu.  Luckily I'd added on several dollar-menu options for the BF, so I wasn't totally screwed out of a meal. But this is pretty much cementing my decision to steer clear of fast food places- or to just resort to this place for the chili in emergency lunch situations."}
{"text":"They just can't get an order right!   It's my neighbor Wendy's but we always have an issue at the drive thru, from the wrong drink to a missing item.  We have the habit know of not leaving the window till we check our order.  But the crazy thing is this week the guy at the order widow was so combative, that we just got our stuff and left. Going back to my office, I go to eat my salad  and yup, no fork, but a knife?"}
{"text":"This place has gone so downhill I will drive out of my way to the one near Clifton bc this one is sooo bad. They just can't get an order right. It's next to impossible. And just so you can tell I'm not some jerk that's mean to FF workers I kept my previous review below.  Also when you get your receipt you can do a survey and the manager will email you.   He promised to give me coupons bc of the three times in a row I had wrong items, items paid for but missing and the rudest service, and guess what.   HE NEVER SENT THEM. Not to me or my neighbor that has experienced the same service. Now when I go I DONT EVEN GET A RECEIPT. Guess he doesn't want to hear about what a bad manager he is.           This is really the only fast food I eat. The location is great and 9/10 times service is accurate and fast.  Being so close to the school there are peak times when this place is crazy ridiculously busy.  The food never seems old like it has been sitting, that is really why I don't like fast food. Also there's options besides burgers and fries. Sometimes I just need freshness like a salad or something. Great for a long work day when you don't want to cook"}
{"text":"Horrible service at drive-thru. Crabby lady pretty much asks \"what do you want?\" Throws your bags at you at the window, like you interrupted her quiet time. No customer service skills whatsoever. I know it's fast food, but come on!  Will never go back."}
{"text":"so the workers are friendly and prompt, but can't complete an order to save their lives. I'm new to River, and this is the 3rd time in less than 2 months I've been here and all 3 times they messed up a sandwich. all I asked was no mayo. also gave my friend a wrong drink, missing condiments etc."}
{"text":"Driest, most burned hockey puck of a burger I ever saw was from here. Mushy tomatoes and cold all around, plus they 'forgot' half the order even though she confirmed over the intercom... Finally, we didn't get a receipt - that's illegal in this country here!     Don't go to this embarrassment to the franchise."}
{"text":"I've been visiting this Wendy's for many years.  I go around eating at many places in the mall. This is one of my favorite places! I visit them frequently.   Most of the staff already knows my order. I am treated very well with every visit.  The quality of food is very equal to any other Wendy's location.   I've never had bad service at this location. All the employees are friendly, & efficient.   There are some negative aspects to visiting this location. The prices are higher than any location I've ever visited. Another bad thing is 99% of the time they don't have trays, so you get your food in a bag, even if you're dining in.  It's a great place to get a meal, at a reasonable price, if you're staying in the area."}
{"text":"This Wendy's marks my favourite Wendy's in all of Calgary.  Why you ask? Because I've spent SO much time here and it brings me right back to the good ol' days when we used to hang out at Brentwood after school. We'd always head over to this Wendy's, grab a McCain's chocolate cake, 6 forks and depending on our mood, a couple of chocolate malts.  When I stepped back in here the other day, I couldn't help but grin like an idiot. I felt like I was a teenager again! I sat at the table we'd ALWAYS sit at, and yup, ordered a McCain's chocolate cake (to take home) and a chocolate malt. MMMM, DELICIOUS!  The service was great, the atmosphere was welcoming and I love that the place was buzzing with students. Some things never change."}
{"text":"Waited in drive thru more than 10 minutes for my food, without so much as an apology. This place is trash."}
{"text":"Uggghhhh! Not only was te service cruddy but the food was crappy. Which makes me so sad cause Wendy's used to be great.....I need to just let go of the past yummy Wendy's days and move on. :-/"}
{"text":"Just stopped here and I am not impressed at all. The service and everything was bad low grade. I know that it's not the best part of town but I don't have very high expectations for Wendy's but cheeseburger was hoping for a decent cheeseburger.... Probably sounds like me bitching but I just wanted a good Burger in the middle of night and  thought this Wendy's might be  a good choice and I guess I was wrong."}
{"text":"This place sucks so bad. We went through the drive thru and ordered two combo meals. Instead, they decided to give us one combo, but still gave us the second drink. After we left, we went back through the drive thru because I wanted sweet and sour sauce, by the way, the lobby was closed. So, when I went back through, they wouldn't open the window to me & tried to ignore me. The only pleasant one there was Johnny. He went out of his way to make our visit great. He is the one who drove us through the drive thru. Hire more people like him and dump the rest."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru at lunch (11:30) for 7 minutes with no cars moving until I finally went inside. First observation is it smells of pee. They are so slow at this location; the cashier was not put together at all. The next employee helping get the orders together was also a mess. Overall 20 minute wait for a 6 piece nugget and small fry. Fast food my ass."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night at 2:30 knowing they are open until 3am. When we pulled around to the drive through there was a car at the window with the passenger side open and the person standing beside the car. A bit weird, but what can you expect at 2:30 am?   We pulled up to the menu and literally sat there for 3+ minutes with nothing...radio silence. So we pulled away, to go past the same car sitting in the drive thru chatting it up with the employee who was laughing and hanging halfway out the window.   Terrible! We will not be back to this location. We just went to the Steak and Shake 1/4 mile down the road, they happily took our business."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is one of the better run franchise stores but is often nearly empty.     With coupons you can eat less expensively than buying groceries and cooking the meal yourself.  I love their fries and chilli.   Yum."}
{"text":"Went there today and they had one person on the register. He took a large order from people in front of us and proceeded to fill this orde himself instead of taking our order. We stood there for a while and I finally asked him if he was going to take our order. He said he had a large order and would be with us shortly. We decided to go elsewhere. We saw one person with earphones filling up condiment trays by the drive thru window. The person running the sag register and taking orders should do that, not fill each order that he takes. Will not return."}
{"text":"I was in the drive-through for over 13 minutesI will remove this review it if contacted by someone from Wendy's still in line waiting"}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way back from my mother's and lets just say the service was horrible. Waited 25 minutes for a 4 for 4, crispy chicken sandwich and Jr fry. First off the guy/manager (Matthew) forgot he even took my order. The fries and nuggets were ice cold sure to there crew being in the back playing around with 5 customers waiting for food. I asked for my money back, the manager asked for my receipt which a younger guy who was off the clock; clocked back in to put together my order. He says to me, well your order is up and I replied and I want my money back. GET BETTER MANAGEMENT!!!!"}
{"text":"The person running the drive through was rude and seemed very impatient. She was too busy messing around and having a conversation with a coworker to serve us properly. Thankfully they were able to get my order correct. I dunno why I'm expecting more from a fast food restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever, even if you're the only one in line for the drive-through expect to wait a long time"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE! The workers seem to hate there job. I have gave this place chance after chance and can't seem to get my order right. I got a spicy chicken with fries and they gave me a burger and I double check with the lady and she gave me attitude and then I had to end up going in the store to fix the problem and they still screwed it up. I worked for WENDYS and you really don't have an excuse to be terrible at making a sandwich and knowing your product. If you don't know what products go with what you shouldn't work here. Not to mention that I have tried to contact this stores manager Rico and no call back nothing. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I can't say how much these people have messed up my wendys experience im ever coming back to this location..."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, both times I threw my food away. I don't get how different locations can be that different"}
{"text":"This might take the rotten cake of being the worst location for Wendy's.  The last time I came here, my sandwich was cold and sloppily put together. Not that I come here for artisan-quality sandwiches, but God-almighty, at least achieve the minimum standard, I've been to other Wendy's locations that know how to at least layer the ingredients properly.  I don't even want to spend too many words talking about this place. My wordsmanship is worth more for more deserving businesses."}
{"text":"I'm not happy with Wendy's I placed a $32.00 order and used 3 credit cards and they where all declined so I told manager calmly I just used one of my credit cards to get gas for my vehicle and there was nothing wrong with it so I went to McDonald's and used the first card that was declined would you know it it was approved I asked manager at Wendy's could your credit/debit machine might be down but he told me know it wasn't sorry Wendy's you lost sale this evening and customer I will not be giving you anymore of my business."}
{"text":"No beuno. Order the chicken sandwich with the new Ghost fries and lets just say not a good experience. The customer service is decent but the food presentation and quality lacks. The fries in the picture are not what I got and the burger tasted as if it had been setting out."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a frosty with my four-year-old niece. Had amazing customer service from Jeremy. Loved the design, with two separate areas just to sit and relax, one with a  TV and one with what looks like an electronic fireplace. It's over 100 degrees out today,  so that's no benefit yet, but would be amazingly cool once it gets cold out. Have never been much of a Wendy's customer, but 50 Cent Frosty's and such good service will make me become a more regular customer."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at a Wendy's!!!! I ordered for dine-in. My daughter's drink order was wrong to start. How can you mix up coke and lemonade? Then it took forever to get our burgers. While we wait our fries are sitting on b the tray getting cold. Once we received our burgers one was wrong. After getting it corrected my fries were then really cold. Top it off with the ketchup dispensers being empty. I asked for ketchup and was handed 3 packets. Avoid this location if you can."}
{"text":"Wow. Talk about fast food... just kidding how about you wait in the drive through for 15 minutes. Fml these people are dumb af also."}
{"text":"This Wendy's was totally remodeled. The dining room was maid to look like a cafe. It's the nicest looking Wendy's I've ever seen.  Prices are good. Service was great. It's comparable with other Wendy's in the area!  Figuring out where to order and pick up your order, is a bit confusing.   They have the new cola machine, which gives you anything you want.  The seating is very comfortable, and it's the only Wendy's I've ever seen with a fireplace.  I would return to this Wendy's restaurant again."}
{"text":"Great food but it is called fast food for a reason. Two cars in front of me and I spent 10 minutes in the drive through. Pick up the pace people."}
{"text":"Shift Leader or manager was really crass. Ate lunch but was still hungry.  They gave us coupons,  so tried to use one.  The shift Leader said to cashier that I had to make another purchase.  I said coupon says nothing.  She said next purchase.  It is my next purchase.  She was really rude."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's very much but the only reason they got 4 stars out of 5 is because sometimes in the evening the window cashier is very rude and even yells at you through the box when you're ordering your food... Look people I get it you're working fast food but if you don't like the job, don't get the job... That is all!"}
{"text":"Since the remodel and reopening, the service and wait time have definitely gotten better. Sure, they're busy at lunch and dinner but that is to be expected. It looks so much nicer inside and the employees are friendlier."}
{"text":"Usually just a Frosty guy and I did partake in the 50 cent summer promotion, but also ventured into new item territory. The queso craze hit me hard and so did about 1000 queso commercials. Now I read a review and some guy had said to try and get the queso on the baked potato instead of the fries. The drive through staff was stunned at my request and admitted nobody had ever asked for that combination. The queso was very cheesy and a perfect fit for the famous Wendy's baked potato. Not a queso expert, but enjoyed this version for about $2 Balanced it out with a $2 grilled chicken wrap packed with chicken, lettuce and unknown sauce. Not a bad late night fast food trip at all. Get the queso before it goes away."}
{"text":"don't go here if you know whats good for you !!! Its so dirty inside I got my food to go instead of eating there, They need to close this place !!!!!"}
{"text":"Have given this place a fair try. After this last time I will not return. Customer service is a joke. With being the closest Wendy's to my work I eat here on a lunch break inside the restaurant. The majority of the time  my sandwiches are cold, Fries never fresh, flies in the lobby-today was an overwhelming amount and smelled bad aswell. They give back the wrong change constantly. And after witnessing my food being touched with bare hands also after handling money.. I will not return. Check your policies and hire people who will follow them."}
{"text":"I don't have any complaints about the food because it's just fast food and Wendy's is pretty much what you expect them to be. The low rating is because service is slow most of the time. Now I know today it's hard to find a job and I'm all for supporting people who need them, but clearly their cashiers is an example why their job can be easily replaced with a computer.      It never fails that I always have to repeat what I order twice. Not to make sure that my order is right but as I'm ordering. That's a big difference because it's as if they didn't just hear me literally a few seconds ago. Let me be clear that English is my only language so I don't have an accent.         Food is usually made in time. The ordering process is not something I'm looking for when you are dining in."}
{"text":"NOTHING fast about this food. Last time I came here I missed a flight. This time, I wasnt in a hurry, but it still took forever. Everyone in line was visibly disgusted. The employees are polite but they move like they have lead in their feet."}
{"text":"Okay, I can update this review.  So, in the past, the food orders have been wrong..... Or not hot, or tough.  However, the staff is still really polite, and the food has been improving. Especially their new Smoked Gouda chicken sandwich. It's on a pretty tasty bun, topped with mixed greens, and an onion sauce. The onion sauce is a little sweet for me, but the chicken has been tender and juicy each time. My guy and I are now obsessed with these sandwiches."}
{"text":"Low expectations from the start but this was bad. First- customer service was a bit slow but super nice and polite. Food was definitely fast as fast food should be. Salad was as expected, should have chosen something other than spicy Asian but meh.  Bad- the sandwich was school lunchroom quality. The grilled chicken was boiled to infinity then had some grill marks added for color. It was literally like biting into rubber. Honey mustard was surprisingly bland. And soggy tomato. Not worth the money.  But they have a make your own coke machine."}
{"text":"Everything is great for the price that's paid but the employees look very mad all the time but everything other than that is great , it's great for groups"}
{"text":"This may be nearly the worst Wendy's in Las Vegas/Henderson. I have visited & ordered more than once to give them the benefit of the doubt only because there are a couple of employees that work at night that are extremely nice and seem to try to give good customer service and give you fresh & hot food. But the others, during the day especially, are not worth wasting the energy to comment on their ability to be so awful! It doesn't seem hard to mess up the chili they have on their menu, but it should come as no shock that this location did! It tasted burnt, literally had no beans in it and was so watery it's almost like they poured a pitcher of water into the burnt on crusty bottom of pan leftovers from the day before and dumped it into a container and sold it to this unlucky patron. I've had many cups of it from Wendy's locations across the country. What this place is serving isn't something the company should ever want to put their name on. Gross! Don't waste your money going to this location! There are plenty of other fast food places around the area to choose from that will have far friendlier employees and much better food!"}
{"text":"We love Wendy's, however this place is a poor example and a blemish on the franchise. First of all, a girl behind the counter (Katherine) was asked for a drink that went with a,gentleman's order, instead of reaching right in front of her , she proceeded to tell someone in the back that she doesn't have a ride home, and shes not sure what to do (all this,in spanish). And the coroner is waiting while she's blabing, I'm standing in line and after I get her attention she finally asks what I needed. \"I would like to place an order\", she then very rudely says, \"Well your supposed to stand over here. I don't have a problem with that, except if it's obvious I don't know,what I'm doing, nicely state what I should do, I honestly do not care,about your problems, I'm the customer, and without us you don't get a paycheck. While I was writing this review, to customers had an argument, simply because they were (staff) not doing what they are supposed to be doing, TAKING CARE IF THE CUSTOMER!!!!"}
{"text":"So stopped by this Wendy's. Let me start off by saying It takes a lot to give a 5 Star or a 1 star. I don't think I've ever given a 1 star. But.... we added a med fries at the drive through after they gave us a  total of 11 something bumped up our total to 13 something. The reason I included this is because we never received a receipt. Well we got home. No fries. Well I look up the phone number because I have no receipt. Call. Line is busy. Keep calling. Line still busy. Looked up on google found another number line is busy.  So decided to make another 8 mile round trip to fix the problem. Just before walking in tried the 2 phone numbers one lost time , busy, Go inside and  young man at the counter greets me and I explained my situation.... no fries.... no receipt.... about 45 min hour ago.... drive thru... I tried calling but line was busy....   So the next question they asked me was \"what size\" I said \"medium\". The young man was polite and informed me that it would be a couple minutes because the fries were in the oil. Well he told someone in the back near the fries station, and this lady brushed the tip of her nose 2 times with her thumb and I was thinking I hope she doesn't serve my fries. Well she did, I was watching like a hawk and just the boxes were touched. She was obviously frustrated because she then threw the boxes she had in her hand and said \"nobody talk to me right now\". Ask the people who work there if this happened, I'm sure they will say this did happen. I was close to just walking out at this point. So the young man at the counter slides the fries to me and after an awkward silence he asked do you want a bag? I said \"yes, I live a long way away\" he bagged em up. And I walked out. I walked back in and asked what the phone number was. Well they informed me, after looking up on a cell phone, what the number was, and I said \"I tried that number multiple times and the line was busy.\" I asked if the phones were working? Again got deer in the headlights. I said thanks and turned and walked out. And got a \"have a nice day\" from the young man at the counter.   Get home. And go online to see if there is anyone to contact. But guess what.... I can get a free burger if I do a survey online. A survey! And guess what they need, a receipt. Double checked car and bags. No receipt.   Now I've worked in the food industry in the past for 10+years. And I am in no way looking for a free handout. Just something like an apology, and maybe an upgrade to a large fry? Or a drink. But I drove an extra 8 miles, and tried to call multiple times, I guess that's what you need to do if you want your order to be correct. But you get a FREE burger for a survey, FREE. After I left the final time I tried the phone number again and magically it went through.  Just changed upgraded to 2 stars because nobody was rude."}
{"text":"Drive through is atrociously bad and inaccurate.  I always order a combo without a bun, small chili (I take out the beans) and a coke zero. I cannot have sugar or a high number of carbs so I stick to this.   Unfortunately, whenever I order the burger without the bun, the restaurant refuses to put mayo and ketchup that the burger is supposed to come with on the burger without the bun. Even if you specifically ask for it, they refuse to do it.  Today I ordered the same thing, asking for the sauces on the burger, but again nothing. No sauces at all.  Not only did this happen, but they gave me a regular coke instead of coke zero. Now I can't have any carbs at all for the rest of the day because of this. Not only was my meal for the day ruined, but my meals for the rest of the day as well.   All the drive through has to do is take a breath and listen to what the customer has to say instead of constantly rushing the customer.   If you're allergic to large amount of sugar, diabetic or have any kind of dietary restrictions, DO NOT go to this location. They WILL add whatever you cannot have into the meal."}
{"text":"This Wendy's right here never fails to put me in a psychotic rage. All I ever ask for is a plain hamburger- no cheese, no toppings. Plain. Simple. But apparently everyone who works here just can't fathom a burger not having cheese on it because no matter how I word it there is always cheese on my burger. So pretty much if you go here, you're probably not going to get what you want. You're just going to be angry."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but I've given this place about 5 tries with the same result each time.  It's your average Wendy's food but the service is hands down the worst and slowest I've ever experienced from a \"fast food\" establishment.  Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Zaxbys or McDonald's.   2 months later: still awful!  Walked in and there was no one in line. Stood there for over a minute before someone acknowledged me. I decided to start a timer once my food was ordered.  It took 9 minutes 38 seconds from the time I paid till I had my food.  It's almost comical how bad the service is here.    Update 6mo later: Moved from 1 star to 3... they have improved dramatically!"}
{"text":"I dined here last weekend. I tried the new \"Mushroom Bacon Melt\" and it was so good. Besides, the fries were crispy and there was lots of choices of soft drink. I gonna come back this Sunday :)"}
{"text":"By far the worst Wendy's we've ever been to. Went through drive through on 8/26/17 around 8:15pm. After ordering waited in line for roughly 20 min and when we finally got to the window the cashier said \"it will be a few minutes we just dropped nuggets! Seriously! I told her the wait was ridiculous and to just give me a cheeseburger. They did give us a cheeseburger instead and when we asked for our Coke....imagine that they were out! It gets better, the food we waited so long for was stone cold! STAY AWAY for this Wendy's."}
{"text":"Quick drive-thru service and food served hot!  Staff was friendly.  Definitely coming to this location again."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is always crazy and hectic but my food is always up quick and never have an issues."}
{"text":"Every great once in a while I'll have a craving for a triple burger from Wendy's. This hasn't resulted in a heart attack yet, so I'll try and keep this craving to once or twice a year. But, I have to say, this is the best fast food burger out there, and although I wouldn't want you to make a habit of eating like this, I do recommend it... Once or twice a year!"}
{"text":"SO DISGUSTING- please read!!  Today I had to use the restroom and this was the nearest public restroom. Wendy's. While I was in the restroom an employee was taking a drive thru order from the other bathroom stall !!! As soon as the employee heard my me flush the toilet she ran out and didn't even wash her hands !!!!!!!  Dont come to this wendy's SHARE! ! !  4902 E Ray Rd Phoenix, AZ  85044"}
{"text":"Of the original big 3 burger places Wendy's, McDonald's and Burger King, Wendy's is the only one I eat at. With that being said I will never go back to this location. A few days ago I went there and they got most of my order wrong. I called and spoke to a manger who told me next time I came in to give my name and I would get my order replaced free of charge. Well I did that tonight. The manager integrated me, had no idea what I was talking about. Eventually he made my order but not before giving me a great deal of attitude.   Besides the terrible customer service I was amazed at the poor condition of the restaurant. Their soda machine in the dining room was out of order, the ketchup pump also was not working. And the soda machine behind the counter was out of Sprite products.   Obviously a big part of the allure for customers to go to a chain restaurant is for consistency and each location is supposed to be a representation of the entire company. In my opinion they failed. And if I worked at corporate I would be watching this location carefully. And as a consumer I will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Not sure how my Frosty melted from the time it came out of the machine to when it was handed to me at the drive thru window 20 seconds later. Always feel the need to try new fast food products and the Waffle Cone had been on the short list for awhile. Your not missing anything with this semi-stale cone and then the old reliable Frosty (vanilla) was a disgrace at this location. Unless it was 109 inside the store, that ice cream should not have melted. Waffle Cone was only $1.69, but I'm going back to the Frosty in a cup with the spoon that usually sticks straights up and I won't be getting it at this sorry location."}
{"text":"I took my daughter out to Wendy's as a treat for good behavior and when I was there I noticed something, all cooking and packing staff that were working DID NOT have gloves on, that is disgusting how can serve food and not have gloves on at a public restaurant that is against food services regulations. Very dissatisfied with their service."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start this. WOW, was this an experience in more ways than one. At 1:30 on a Sunday, this place was pretty packed. And boy was the service s l o w. Honestly it took me close to 25 minutes to order in the dining room. If I hadn't walked here, and been craving a frosty and baked potato from just having my wisdom teeth out, I would have definitely gone somewhere else.   They had 1 single person working the register. She was nice, but extremely slow. It was almost comical how long this took. Luckily the food was ready in probably 3 minutes after I ordered. Why they didn't have some one else come up to help, I'll never know.   The clientele that this place was filled with was less than desirable. To make it worse, there was even two workers 'on break' on the patio next to us, talking about their \"baby mamma's & Baby daddy\" drama ... I kid you not. It was like we were in a live-action version of Jerry Springer.   Save yourself the trouble and don't bother with this location."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience ever at Wendy's today. The manager was an idiot because he allowed his employee to talk over him and argue with a customer when they were wrong. We ordered 2 #7s and they told us that it will be 3 minutes for the 2nd one. We waited at least 6 minutes we went inside. The dining room was dirty and employees was walking around doing nothing. We stood at the counter for 2 minutes and they finally came up to  the counter. One chicken was sitting on the counter and the second hadn't even been dropped yet. The lady in the kitchen said oh you needed 2. We asked for our money back and the guy in the drive thru tried to get confrontational when he know he was wrong. The. Manager didn't say anything to him. He thought it was funny. That is the worst customer service i have ever experience. I was a restaurant mgr for years and i took pride in my job and customer service was #1. You shouldn't even have one star."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience! Came in with my grandparents to treat they tend to be indecisive but the staff was great the manager on staff that night was patient and very friendly. Definitely an A+ on service! Haven't seen great service like that in a while!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's isn't the worst but it certainly isn't the best. Sometimes they get my order wrong but they're close by."}
{"text":"Customer service here is awful including the manager and the tables are filthy  I would definitely go to a different Wendy's from now on"}
{"text":"This location isn't bad at all on the outside... They never mess up my order and tend to be generally nice people working there.  Went inside for the 1st time today and probably the last. Very sad looking on the inside and has a dirty feel to it. I'll still go here but not gonna be going inside anymore."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's ever. I have seen cleaner abortion rooms than this place. The welfare workers who work here are slow and possibly mentally handicapped."}
{"text":"They cheapened the hamburger meat. It's so gross that I can't eat them anymore. Now all I get here is a salad."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Decent food. Really quick service. I was in and out in 2 minutes. I would come to this location again."}
{"text":"While you generally can't expect much from big fast food joints, this one seemed significantly below par when compared to other Wendy's establishments.   Dropped by to pick up a spicy chicken sandwich as a snack one afternoon.   The lady working the cash and counter had a couldn't-be-bothered attitude, and appeared to be counting down the minutes until her shift ended.   When the sandwich arrived, there were just enough ingredients so it legally constituted what was a spicy chicken sandwich (photo of spicy chicken sandwich).   Unfortunately, this Wendy's didn't provide a regular Wendy's receipt which would allowed customers to provide feedback on some survey website.  Overall, a poor experience; plenty of other food options in Scotia plaza and the PATH - save your money, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Average Wendy's but a very convenient location.  Its a bit tough to turn left out of here some times of the day, but still a great spot.  My favorite remains the spicy chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"Save yourself and go to the Wendy's in Urbana. This one sucks. The staff is almost worthless and extremely slow. I have yet to go there and find the condiments, straws, and lids stocked. When asking the staff for any sort of assistance they return a soulless state back at you."}
{"text":"They would not refill by tea, unlike the rest of the Wendy's in the area... Avoid this location at least for its lack of customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? This evening, someone's car shut down in the middle of the dive thru. I was behind him, so I pulled over to park and help the poor guy out since he was solo. It's him and I trying our best to move his SUV (pretty hard with 2 people with sandals on). We struggled for a couple minutes in the drive thru, people waiting for us to leave so they can place their order, not bothering to give just 1 more set of hands, even though that's all we needed. That was until Josh came to the rescue. Josh is the manager at this location. Without him we wouldn't have got the SUV to the gas station in great time. That was a good deed for him to do that. He could've sent a lower level employee out to help us but he did what leaders do, and took initiative. He deserves to be at a high position, if possible, higher than where he's at. This is BEYOND customer service, it literally is. I'm forever grateful for the help, and he expected NOTHING in return. Great guy you guys have as a shift leader, keep it up Wendy's. Once again, thank you Josh you're a good man."}
{"text":"very good establishment, I always have the correct orders and great customer service."}
{"text":"Never will me and my husband ever give our money to this Wendy's. Management asks just like a bad employee. It's never appropriate to say the \"N\" word in front of a customer. Especially when we just asked for a simple receipt? As a customer that paid, I'm pretty sure we have the right to HAVE a receipt of our purchase, we shouldn't be asked what do we need the receipt for. The two guys gave us service like they were doing US a favor."}
{"text":"So normally I wouldn't write a review about a fast food restaurant but this evening as we were here there were two extremely young,  scantly clothed drunk teen girls in the restaurant. It appeared that the girls were friends of the employees as they spoke to them by their names.  As their asses hung out of their short,  shorts,  the girls ran around obviously intoxicated taking selfies and laughing about how they don't drink. I'm sorry but if this is your place of employment and your friends are intoxicated and acting like fools, they should be asked to leave.  Not a family environment!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst.  I've been to a lot of different Wendy's around the US since I travel for work.  Wendy's is always my go to when the only option I have is fast food.  It's needs to to be updated.  It smells funny inside.  It doesn't have a coke freestyle like most Wendy's do which was a big bummer for my family.  It is pretty small and understaffed but that may be because they're hiring.  Over all it taste like Wendy's but just not as pleasant as others."}
{"text":"I will forever remember this drive-through conversation:  Welcome to Wendy's. Can I take your order?  Yeah, I'd like a Frescuit.   We ain't got no hashbrowns!  ...um, all I want it a Frescuit.   A'ight... I'm just lettin' you know."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Could not understand person taking our order. She was slurring her words. When asked question about order she became  loud and combative. Took a somewhat long time to get order. Server waiting on others after us first. Server uniform was very dirty and she wore her hat gangsta style with the bill to one side and it was filthy. Chicken sandwich was very good, chili could have been hotter, Most tables were dirty."}
{"text":"Never get fresh fries. Only takes a couple minutes to give people what they pay for. No excuses. Just lazy asses."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff, will never visit this location ever again. Tried to order a bacon deluxe cheeseburger they yelled at me that they have never heard of it, showed them a picture on my phone they once again chewed me out saying that's not available at every location. They should all be fired. Update, just opened and took a bite out of the baconator I was forced to but instead and it was basically raw. Thanks Wendy's I'll now be calling your corporate office to complain not just a bad Yelp review."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would - it is a very rare occasion that I give a negative review but something needed to be said about this place and hopefully the owners/operators will see this and address it. My 8 year old girl wanted to eat here and so did my 5 year old boy. We went inside with the intent to order and eat inside.  One person was in front of me and I realized immediately it was an employee off duty. So we waited patiently until their conversation was done - about 45sec felt much longer, she then left and we had yet to be acknowledged, 3 people were up front and we are still waiting with no greet.  Now 2minutes have passed since the girl left.  I thought something was wrong so I waited a little while longer patiently, a customer came in and was behind us.  After about another 30 seconds, the customer asked if I was being waited on.  I politely told her no.  Finally after being in the rest. For 5 minutes just standing there they asked if I have been helped. I told them no.  She asked what we wanted I placed one of 3 orders hen she asked who was on the grill.  Without any notice or apology she just walked to the back another girl then stepped up and said what can I get you. I was in disgust. Politely I told them we do not want anything and we will not be back. They didn't apologize no remarks. I truly will not be back to that location and unfortunately we live less than a mile away. Shame on those employees."}
{"text":"This is the only Wendy's restaurant I would ever give 5 stars to. Every single I travel by plane (I do it for a living), this is my go-to breakfast place. I always get the bacon artisan with the breakfast potatoes and one sausage, egg and cheese biscuit on the side. Regardless of the size of the line, it always moved quickly and efficiently. I've never had to wait longer than 10 minutes for the entire process (including getting my meal). Gilbert is always friendly and seems like he's a beast at his job! Always plugging away and working efficiently. I've never had an order messed up in ANY way, and my food is always hot and closely resembles the pictures on the menu. Good job, Wendy's."}
{"text":"This Wendy's in the past was deserving of one star. Recent changes have helped improve quality of service. Still not the best Wendy's, but no where near the worst. If you need to use the restroom ask the cashier for the bathroom key."}
{"text":"DON'T come here if you're in a hurry. From the time I walked in to receiving my food was 20 minutes... not a one time thing either, this has been my experience every time I've been at this location. After finally getting my food I unwrap my baconator. Now I know these things are greasy, but my baconator buns were soggy from so much grease. Friendly workers and the food is usually decent, it's just very slow. Inside is kind of dank and outdated. Definitely needs updating."}
{"text":"Tired of going through the drive thru, ordering what I do and getting something totally different by the time I get home. Has happened more then three times in the last 6 months. I don't get as to how hard it is to get an order right.  I have spoken to the manager and called and they just don't seem to care. They fill like you are trying to get a free meal out of them. And you know what? They should give me a free meal for always screwing up my order.. Frustrated! YES I AM darn it."}
{"text":"Horrible , walked in the place and the twit behind the counter looks directly  at me says nothing  then just  stands there.  Then I oder my buyer plain  nothing on it and I get it with cheese. Go  to eat my fries and they are loaded with salt that. The stupid cunt working there  purposely overloaded because  I reprimanded her about  not speaking manager (also some punk kid) was no help and didn't  care one way or the other . I realize they don't pay much but that's  no excuse  for hiring whatever  degenerate  that walks in off the street.  You'd  be better off with a  can of spam and some crackers then eating in a place run by idiot poorly trained teenagers."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is the best one in the area. Normally I don't eat at Wendy's but this place is right next to my work and is so convenient. But there are plenty of food places bear here so if it wasn't good, I really don't HAVE to go there. I go because the food is always great, their salads are fresh the chicken is cooked perfectly. The workers are wonderful. Tammy is amazing and helpful. I definitely recommend this Wendy's if you're looking for something quick and yummy."}
{"text":"Fast service and Danny obviously loves his job. The only unfortunate thing I saw here was his coworkers rolling their eyes at him. He might be a bit much but come on he is nice friendly and makes customers smile. Thanks Danny!"}
{"text":"Desiree if that's the proper spelling. Was at the register drive through. Poor customer service skills, neglected to give us our drink ordered and had to come back to get it. Had to ask for ketchup and napkins since we didn't get any and when we asked her politely for some she had what looked like a permanent scowl on her face for asking."}
{"text":"Just love Wendy's burgers, I order with out cheese and onion and I have never drove away with my order not being right un like other fast food places. The drve thru is fast and the person at the window was very friendly  Will go here before another place near by."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Wendy's.  It's usually my go to fast food place, but not this location.  Every other wendy's I have ever been to has had really fast drive thru service, that's kind of what they're known for.  Not this one.  There were 4 cars in front of me, and I noticed they kept pulling out with no food.  So I get to the window, I pay, and the girl tells me to pull up to the front of the restaurant and she'll bring my food out.  Well, I get there, and of course that's where the other 4 cars are.  So after about 10 minutes, the girl finally comes out with a bunch of bags of food.  But she doesn't know which bag goes where!  So she figures some of the orders out, comes over to me with a bag, but it turns out it was the other cars food.  So then she says sorry, she has to go get mine.  Well about 10 more minutes later, she finally comes out with my order.  It was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen at a Wendy's.  And I will definitely never go back to this location."}
{"text":"While in Sedona, AZ, we stopped at Wendys and two of us ordered the Ciabatta Bacon Cheeseburger; it was awesome. Soooo, 6 days later while close to home I decided to stop at the local Wendys, ordered the same Ciabatta Bacon Cheesburger to split between 2 people. I was highly disappointed. Didn't look or taste like the first one -- half the size and no taste. I will probably go as far as to stop to talk to the manager sometime in the near future."}
{"text":"This place is awful, I come here 3 times a wk for the last month (I'm attending euphoria behind Wendy's), & they never get my order correct. Even just a simple baked patato, they never have baked patatoes and say it will take 20 min to make them. I've tried the strawberry lemonade 3 times, & it was always so gross and watered down. I tried really hard to give this location a chance, but they are never good."}
{"text":"Decided to try the latest craze and had the bacon cheese burger pretzel sandwich. It was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Bacon pretzel burger fiasco! Ok they have on the menu one price for just the burger And one price for the combo Clearly stated! Ok so I order the combo yes it was cheaper then just the burger ! But a advertised price nonetheless ! Was argued with over the clearly advertised price ! Now me being a customer and clearly seeing a advertised price on a menu  I should have not been argued with! But I was it is not my fault you can not advertise correctly ! Rather then argue you could have gave me the advertised price! Then changed your sign to make it read correctly! Well I did not but the stupid burger And won't return ! Simply because of advertising mistakes that this manager personally made! And the poor service and argumentative nature I was exposed too! I will never pay more then advertised price anywhere ! For anything! And neither should you! Any business would have honored the price and fixed the price without argument simple business ethics!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is just average anymore.  A few things I hate about most Wendy's:   1.  Why do I have to ask for a refill?  Most every other place allows me to get refills on my own. 2.  Where did the old salad bar go?  That used to be one of my reasons for coming. 3.  What's up with these new fries, they suck.  Other than those complaints, I really do like some of the new burgers especially the limited time burgers they have done.  Of course, the kid in me still loves the FROSTY, good old chocolate frosty's are enough to put a smile on my face."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for the worst customer service of your life and food that you didn't pay for and missing items you did pay for, check this place out!  Seriously though, they've lost me as a customer with their disrespectful employees and incompetence."}
{"text":"Seems as if Shaquille is on some kind of mind altering drugs, he has a hard time comprehending my order.  Made me re-clarify multiple times, and it was just a frosty.  Lol."}
{"text":"Out of all the burger chains, Wendys bas a special place in my heart. My dad and I used to sneak off here for \"Big Bacon Classics\", fries and shakes here when I was a kid.   It seems they have done a lot of menu experimentation since I was a kid, and now they have like maybe three kinds of basic burger (didn't see the baconater listed) plus the big bacon classic. Its a good burger with a decent bun and sauce at a decent price. Not as pricey as some \" gourmet\" burger chains (I'm looking at you hero burger) while being just as tasty.   This location is usually fairly busy and has the normal big city character you associate with any place along this stretch of Yonge."}
{"text":"I usually don't like reviewing fast-food joints; unfortunately, I have to on this one, due to the fact I constantly visit this Wendy's more than any of the others, especially in the last 3 months.   I eat here on occasion for a quick bite, which it has been either around lunch time or late at night. Now, the food will remain the same since it is a corporate-owned fast-food restaurant; therefore, I have no problem with the food, especially the Baja Salad (with no dressing) - superb! Service, on the other hand, can  vary depending on the time you visit this particular location.   When I get off the \"normal\" Vegas shift, roughly 11/1130 pm, and in the mood for Wendy's, the service is standard - no waiting time, no rude service, etc. The late/graveyard shift-workers are exceptional at their job. Around midnight, my friend and I ordered one medium lemonade drink and a small soda drink. Instead, the guy who took our order ended up accommodating us to two medium-sized drinks and charged us for one medium and one small. (I think he was hitting on my friend, but who knows?)   Now, there were days after my morning exercise (near brunch hour), I have gone to Wendy's (this particular location) and have gotten the opposite service! The staff during this shift tend to talk more and gossip among themselves in front of the customers, which I have witnessed seeing orders mistaken due to miscommunication on their end, which included mine. I don't know how many times I hear disgruntled employee murmur under their breath as their walking by. I understand it's a minimum wage job, but in front of the customers? Really? I don't know how many times I hear the same employees gossip about one another in front of me as I'm ordering and confuse my order!  All I'm saying is be observant when visiting this specific location"}
{"text":"I stop by Wendy's on those late hungry nights on my way home from work.  Out of all the many times they've only gotten one order wrong, but were quick to redeem themselves of the mistake by giving me extra food.  Good fast food restaurant.  Good friendly staff."}
{"text":"My food was terrible. Ordered chicken nuggets and French fries. Chicken nuggets were cold, and gross because they've probably been sitting out for 4 hours. My French fries. Total joke. I can't even tell you if temperature was good, because they were ALL hard as bricks... So burnt that they were hollow. Literally (will post pics). Thanks for wasting my time & money, total BS. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Specifically asked for FRESH chicken nuggets multiple times throughout the ordering process. When we paid, we immediately got the food, which we thought was weird because it takes time to cook. We asked if it was fresh, the guy said yes. He is a liar. The food was disgusting. Chicken nuggets tasted so gross we threw them away. Never coming here again, I never have an issue with Burger King"}
{"text":"I went in and ordered the new breakfast  bowl.it was about 9:50 am  .left too fond out they charged me for the bowl.but gave  me biscuit & gravy. Call they said they couldn't do anything now because  it was after 10:00 . I stood right there & heard the cashier  tell the person what I ordered. I know they just through the biscuit  & gravy in bag since it was a to go order knowing I would be gone before I noticed. That's ok my family won't  eat there anymore. If they would have just said we don't have any more. I would have ordered something  different. But instead  they just stuck something  else  in bag hopping  I wouldn't notice tell I was down the road. Tks"}
{"text":"This is a hot spot for a lotta people in the area. It's always busy especially on weekends and holidays. Always nice to come here with a small group of friends or family and relax with a coffee."}
{"text":"Got a large piece of plastic in my Chili once. That was extremely creepy as hell biting into it. We only really come here for a cup of coffee and a Frosty."}
{"text":"Since the new management took over this place has been cleaner and more efficient. It's pretty much like any other Wendy's around but the service here is way better than most"}
{"text":"When we first got out of the vehicle we were approached TWICE by drug heads asking for money. Terrible customer service and rude staff. The food was cold. The dining room was FILTHY. Food and trash littered empty tables. Only a couple customers in the restaurants. Instead of cleaning, the crew just laughed, joked and cursed so loud you could hear them from where we sat. Such a pity that Wendy's would have their name on this franchise owner's nightmare. I will defiantly be sending a letter to corporate about my experience here."}
{"text":"The employees were so nice, I really felt like they cared a lot about making sure I was happy with my meal. They were also very knowledgable about which products were vegetarian, which was helpful to me, personally."}
{"text":"Staff is always rude, in store and at drive though window. They basically throw your food out the window at you. If you really want to piss them off, ask for condiments at the drive through. The food is typically cold or luke warm at best. I avoid this Wendy's unless I'm really in a bind."}
{"text":"After a long day of traveling and being awake going on 13+ hours, I was in need of some affordable nourishment. Let's face it, airport food is expensive. Wendy's? A decent alternative at an affordable price. I never expect fast food employees to go above and beyond, but these ladies at this location did just that! From the friendly service to the quick delivery of my delicious and correctly prepared food...it was a pleasant surprise that honestly made my day a little less crazy. Thanks for making me crack a smile after a long day of airports and cranky passengers."}
{"text":"Don't forget to put sauce in the bags!!! Especially with the drive through. I go on my break and don't have time to always check. And I can't even eat my nuggets or fries cause they didn't put in the sauce I asked for .It's a waste of food. DON'T FORGET THE SAUCE ITS CRUCIAL! Love Wendy's but the nuggets are way to bland to not have a sauce."}
{"text":"They completed redesigned the interior of this Wendy's and because of the new design I am a big fan of coming here.  Justa  few months ago this Wendy's was pretty plain (like most of them), now they have a better looking interior, they have a soda fountain machine with 1000 different flavors, and they have Televisions so like today I can watch Baseball or whatever else may be on.  I really like the fact that they now have a public soda machine so I don't have to go to the counter and ask for a refill which I always thought was the dumbest thing about Wendy's.  Wendy's has improved their food as well.  I really like the Baconator and the son of Baconator.  The new Pretzel bun burgers are pretty good too.  I ordered the Son of Baconator today and with small frries and a drink cost around $7.  Based off the size of the burger and the taste I think it was well worth the price.  Of course they still have the same old yummy frosty and several other inexpensive food chaices as well.  I get tired of eating all the same old burger places all the time, but Wendy's is a good choice when you are on a quick lunch run.  A couple of months ago I would have rated this 3 stars, but due to the very nice interior redesign, it's now a 4."}
{"text":"Doing a great job your friendly service fast service and clean atmosphere... Austin took our order was on top of it and the manager BEAR is doing an awesome job always reflects good management!"}
{"text":"Try Daves new juicy burgers.  Holy hell they are good!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this location, but nothing that bad either.....just a typical experience. One real negative at least for me is the lack of a self serve drink machine.....really? Have not come here on a number of occasions for that reason alone.  Who stands in lines for refills anymore?"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been here... The food was cold. My fries were soggy. The staff is nice but they are very very slow. Waste of money..."}
{"text":"This place needs to be shut down for a remodel and all new equipment and to rehire some new nice friendly clean employees."}
{"text":"The food is hot and cheap, the nutritional information is easily available, and the waiting time for the food is very brief. I've never had any trouble in the multiple times I've eaten here or used the drive through. I also have a personal preference for their spiced chicken dishes over other similar chains."}
{"text":"6/1/17 11:00am  Tried to place an order through the drive thru, the guy taking orders was a dick. I understand your minimum wage ass is miserable and broke as fuck but don't take that out on customers. Now I know why I see videos of fast food employees getting their ass beat all the time. Don't go here, unless you like being talked down to by people who make 8.25 an hour."}
{"text":"Worst. Restaurant. Ever.....  I live in the neighborhood and I will never eat here again. It's been like this for years and corporate must not care...."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars, I would. Drink machine and eating area trashed. Slow service. No ketchup. Filthy and bad representation of the franchise. Wilted lettuce. They have it ALL!"}
{"text":"The cashier was very helpful In serving me and made sure everything was correct. The manager a young man, asked how my meal was and if I was having a good day. I applaud the manager for expressing concern to a customer,  hard to find now a days. 6:3 2pm 09.05.14 - wendys management please Look into this location for customer service points. I had a great experience."}
{"text":"After standing at an empty counter for awhile, I whistled into the back of the store to get someone to come to the front.  The girl that left her conversation in the back was the drive through person, and had to write the order down and ring it up in the back.  After ringing it up, she cleared it off the screen to keep drive through times low, then had to keep asking for the receipt to make the food.  The burgers were correct, but both cups of chili were only half full.  Still sitting in the restaurant, listening to the loud eude conversations of the workers.."}
{"text":"This location does not even deserve a one star.  Worst customer service ever!!!  I don't understand how some people who work here still have there job!!"}
{"text":"The employees are terrible. Sometimes they won't even take your order, and if they do, check the bag cause they screwed it up. I waited 15 minutes at the speaker with no one in front of me and the moron kept saying \"I'll take your order in a minute.\" If you want Wendys, drive to Monroeville. I'd give this place a lower rating if I could."}
{"text":"I used to work here as a manager about 20 years ago and boy, has it gone down hill! I remember that when they cook hamburgers, they always have to have a few on the grill, even when it's slow so the customer doesn't have to wait. Once they have been on the grill for awhile, they put it in a holding pan and use it for chili. It has almost a rancid grease smell to it in the pan, but once it is boiled down, it tastes fine and is virtually grease-less. Once it hits that pan, it should never be served.  We went about 3:00 in the afternoon and ordered 5 single combos. Three of the five tasted like they took them out of the chili meat pan, the other two tasted ok, although dry. Did they have only two burgers on the grill (and overcooked)? Did they take the other three out of the chili meat holding pan? I guess we will never know for sure. I never complained to the restaurant manager, but did email corporate. I never heard back from them.  Avoid fast food, but...AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!"}
{"text":"Never had an issue here. Food is always good (it's Wendy's) and the service is usually friendly. I've never had an issue with my order and drive thru is typically quicker than what you'd find at other fast food restaurants. I lerk mer Wenders"}
{"text":"This maybe the nastiest facility in Rock Hill. Seating area, counter, serving area, restrooms were deplorable.   Service team seems to be seriously confused on how to provide orders, management team maybe the worst trained part of this complete debacle.   How this site hasn't been shut down by the York County Department of Health remains a mystery."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Don't ever go there. They wouldnt take my order. I asked why and they said \" sorry sir. We can't take you order.\" Good job. Never going to eat at Wendy's again! Doesn't even deserve one star!"}
{"text":"Police involved. I was threatened by the cashier last night. Cashier says, \"I'm gonna sock this f- -cking b-tches ass\"?? Why, because I didn't have an order? How could I? I sat patiently for over 5 mins looking and talking at a blank order screen that was obviously broken along with the mic. When I drove around she yelled several times using the \"f\" word insisting she would not take my \"fkn\" order. All i did was mention to her and her manager that their screen was broken. While the manager went to check on the screen this cashier continued her threats and I was done with any conversation waiting for the manager to return. The manager btw way who never once defended me or tell the cashier to stop behaving in that way (not once). In all my years I have never been treated nor should anyone ever be threatened verbally or physically @ Wendys. I called the police who assisted me. The manager confirmed to 3 police officers the cashier threatened me verbally and physically! Also called corporate last night and will follow up today. Shame on you Wendys! Don't ever let anyone bully you ever. Taking their frustration out on you when they have insufficient intercom and workers."}
{"text":"There was only one item that I would come here for once in a blue moon and that was their 99¢ double stack. I am not a frequent fast food connoisseur and don't eat it on the regular but the double stack was one of the only exceptions I would make every so often. Well they have taken it off their value menu and raised it to $1.79 and officially made it easy for me to never step foot in a Wendys again. It's just not that good to pay any more for.  They also reduced the nuggets to 4 pieces instead of 5.  And they increased the price of their small chili to $1.49.  I will miss your value meals and dollar double stack and your beautiful red pigtails Wendy. RIP Dave Thomas."}
{"text":"Slow.  Slow.  Slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.  Service is terrible.  Inaccurate orders.  Staff that seem in no hurry to do much of anything.  What a shame."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff and staff that shows empathy and that's nice! Always went through the drive thru because I was In a hurry but it is much better than KFC AND MCD if you ask Me"}
{"text":"Ronald needs to be recognized here. He made it a 5 star experience. Thank you Ronald for being bright and aware and an expert at your job! Got my custom order perfect. Fast. Polite. Off the charts! AAA+++"}
{"text":"Homeless people sleep in here all the time. Also it is usually dirty even when there are no customers. The touch screen coke machine is horrible and is usually out of several flavors."}
{"text":"Excellent customer services and very fast.  Would return .  The cashier was super friendly and you can tell she loves her job."}
{"text":"Wendy is not my favorite place ate because their food expensive and doesn't taste that great! I was here first time and will be my last time, I took my little boy there few weeks ago, and my boy ate the food and didn't liked either! They place clean and okay, but the food didn't that great!"}
{"text":"The food is almost always good/fresh, but ever since his store reopened after remodeling, things have gotten slooooooooow. It used to be one of the quickest places to go, now it takes longer than most. Hope they figure that out. Also, what is the point of having two drive through lanes?  Can someone please explain that to me?  All it seems to do is create confusion and chaos within the line."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's in NC they have the Carolina Classic sandwich"}
{"text":"One of the few Wendy's that offers breakfast still. Love the potatoes and eggs they use. The potatoes are sliced and fresh. You also can actually tell that your egg is an egg. Great breakfast sandwiches for a fast food chain. I highly recommend stopping by in the morning. Hidden secret."}
{"text":"My husband and I were going through the drive thru and Neil had phenomenal customer service. Definitely will be back thanks to him."}
{"text":"Great customer service :) and Wendy's sure beats all the other fast food burger joints"}
{"text":"Ok I've learned my lesson. I will NEVER go to this location again. My hamburger and fries were cold and old!  You could taste the old grease in the burger. The frosties are worse than ever. They've started pumping air into the mixture and it tastes like melted ice cream with foam. The employees are young and rude. They never thank you for your order. The manager must never be on site because the service and food is way below par. Do yourself a favor and find a better location if you really have to have their food. Wendy's use to be my place for a good hamburger- not anymore."}
{"text":"It always worth the wait in line to eat at Wendys. I can't say I've ever had a bad experience at a Wendys anywhere. The Burgers are excellent and the employees most times are exceptionally nice and they rarely ever forget to put everything you need in the bag, from napkins to forks or condiments. I wish Macdonalds, could learn what Wendys process is because i cant count how many times McD gets my order wrong or put the wrong food in the bag. This has never happened at Wendys. Also, Wendys food is far superior in taste and freshness in addition to their great service.  Wendys, keep being the best and I'll keep saying great things about you. JOB WELL DONE!!"}
{"text":"This wendys is the best. The employees are always nice, courteous and professional.   Cudous to the Manager Ms Tanya, you really know how to hire quality people.   It goes to show that the staff reflects the management. If you take the time to hire and train good people and set expectations they will always give great customer service."}
{"text":"This used to be an A-OK restaurant when they first opened. Who doesn't like a square burger and have it cooked to order?  Been coming here on and off since day ONE. Usually the food is pretty tolerable and it gets me to my next location - Wally World. Just park the car in the middle of the parking lot and you only have to get out of the car once.  This location seems to always be a little tricky. The French Fries are normally cold and we have to go up and ask for some fresh ones. The Burgers and Chicken Sandwiches are not too bad depending on the roll of the dice and whether it is a full moon or not.  Service is rather poor and the inside could probably use a makeover. Today they asked me for my name and somehow they interpreted (Mark) for Bark. Could this just have been a Freudian slip or are we making Dog noises at me?  It almost seems that ever since the famous Dave Thomas left the picture this place has just gone downhill in general. Plus we miss the old lady with the white hair in the commercials. Ok ... WHERE\"S THE BEEF?  2.25 STARS"}
{"text":"Everything was automated, yet it took forever to place the order. The gal behind the register was \"flighty\" at best.   Not a big fan of the modern look, it was really cold and impersonal.  Not comfy at all. The Coke Freestyle machine was the best thing this one had going for it.   Order was up quick and accurate"}
{"text":"It's Wendy's.  It's a guilty, greasy, unhealthy pleasure.  That said, I love me a Wendy's milkshake."}
{"text":"I dropped by the other day late in the morning to get a donut  at the Tims next door , I noticed the Wendy's open and no kid  so I ordered a burger to go. This was great and it tied me over for a while  . A few hrs later I was back in the neighbourhood and thought pick up a chili at the window and bring it home for dinner. Fast service ,great chili , good experience. I avoid this place during the week because 100s of kids from the school next door make it a noisy uncomfortable place to be."}
{"text":"For a drive thru that is never busy, it takes about 15 minutes every time I go here to get my food. I try to avoid this Wendys at all costs, the one on Pineville Matthews rd is much faster. If there is a line, you might as well go somewhere else if you have somewhere to be."}
{"text":"Food was hot and fresh, staff very friendly. Restaurant was very clean.  One of the better Wendy's I have been too. Was there on 5/26/18 at about 6pm."}
{"text":"Disgusting place I'll never come here again. The burger I was served was cold and tastes so bad I had to throw my only lunch. i am never eating at wendys again. I cant get the cold taste of bacon out of my mouth and beef doesn't even look normal. Sub par food with a expensive menu. I hope they go out of business and something better will take over."}
{"text":"This is the worst drive-through of any fast food chain in Calgary.  The last two times I have gone through they have messed up my order and given some variation of a cheeseburger instead of a freaking chicken burger. Never again. Stay the f*&k away from this f*&king retarded establishment."}
{"text":"This Wendy's need an upgrade for a long time. I would dread coming here be cause of the atmosphere. The place looks good and the food is great! Also the have a Coke Freestyle machine. The also redid the outside."}
{"text":"My wife and I refuse to eat at McDonalds and Wendy's has been our go to place. I do not know what happened but this place has gone to the dogs. We are fed up  with the cold food, reduced quality, higher prices and poor service. Wendy's is on our growing list of places we will no longer visit."}
{"text":"The manager working the cash charged us for 2 drinks on top of our combos. The lineup was very long and we didn't have time to go back and argue once we noticed. Very inefficient and slow staff and the entire place was dirty with garbage bins full and overflow falling on the floor. Area managers need to do some more spot checks at this location.  Check your bill as soon as you receive it."}
{"text":"This location is cool because they have internet and outlets and its not busy so I did my hw in peace and quiet! And the girl with the glasses hooked it up with the value $1 fries yum!"}
{"text":"Best Wendys ever!! So new looking. This wendys even has a coffee house menu with fresh baked goods, tea and coffee. Place is so clean, has a fake fire place area with cute seating. Free wifi as well as those all in one soda machines. I would go here for a coffee break and a meal, the dollar menu is amazing 5 piece nuggets for a dollar each! Lots of parking right by paradise valley mall."}
{"text":"I don't think I would give a fast food chain a glowing review but I am thoroughly impressed with the improvement at Wendy's. I think their menu is improving and this particular location feels like an Ikea store lol"}
{"text":"How can you not like Wendy's?"}
{"text":"Yea, it's a Wendy's but great service! Usually when you're in an airport the service is rude, good thrown together, and extremely overpriced. The line was long and they were busy and the employees were always smiling and pleasant. Not that obnoxious fake pleasant either. They were genuine. The food was great! They do charge 31 cents per ranch but that's corporates policy, not theirs."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Several workers standing around while customers waited almost 15 minutes for their food. Dirty counters. Unfriendly staff."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich and the lettuce on it was gross and old. Called the manager to get a replacement and they were okay with it. I went the next day and get another sandwich. This time there was a bread tie or clip in the sandwich. At this point I wanted a defunded. Spoke with the manager, Chris, the next day. Told him the situation and he looked at me funny, like I was a liar. I told him I wanted a refunded and said he was doing so but with a disgusting attitude. I will never go to this Wendy's again, I will try another Wendy's."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would.  Everytime I  place  an order thru the drive thru I get rude customer service.  Like Im asking a question about a special that  was on the front of the store, it was not on the order screen so I asked can I have the $4.00 deal or $4.44 I was not sure of the price.  So the Host who was on the speaker was totally rude, smart and curt.  But this is nearly every weekday when Decide I would lime Wendys for lunch. The Wendys on Chandler in Awhatukee is my usual Wendy's location.  I guess it depends on what side of the valley your on, when it should not matter.  However I will no longer visit this location, no please or thank you.  I saw a team lead or supervisor standing right at the window once I drove up no apology no nothing.  Just rude, it's funny they act incompetent, but with their mentality I guess they can't help it.  However if I see you at my office and I turn out to be their worker, I bet they will be singing another tune...#customer service is just not teachable."}
{"text":"Same quality as most other Wendy's. But the soda machine is amazing. You must stop here just to experience the drink dispenser."}
{"text":"I ordered the $4 stoner meal with cheeseburger, chicken nuggets, fries and a coke. It was 30min before closing, the service was friendly, and the price was right, therefore 5 stars. The chicken nuggets hit the spot and the coke was refreshing. The good times ended right there as the burger was dry and unedible, and was served cold. That is, the sliver of burger meat was warm, but everything else including the bun was cold. Straight to the trash on that cheeseburger. Same for the cold overcooked short and broken fries. The dipping sauce was straight up disgusting with sweet and sour tasting so bad, and the mustard slightly better. C'mon wendys, get back in the test kitchen and work on those dipping sauces for fucks sake. Anyways, happy they were open and will come back for the nuggets and a coke."}
{"text":"If you don't mind being treated like you just shot the order takers dog, and don't mind waiting 20-30 minutes for a junior bacon cheeseburger, this is the place for you!  The food however is good. Also watch out for the drunken hobos that come out of the dirtbag motels and yell at random cars at 11am."}
{"text":"I've done lunch runs for work here a ton and I feel like I understand too much about how this Wendy's operates. I've almost never gone inside here because they clearly prioritize their drive-through stats. That said, they train their employees to do both, it seems, and their service to the drive-through kind of sucks. Almost every single time, I have had to repeat my order.  Here's a quick re-enactment of about 90% of our interactions: I arrive \"Welcome to Wendy's. Go ahead and order when you're ready.\" \"Thanks! I'll have a medium homestyle number 8 with no tomatoes and a Coke--\" \"A number 8?\" \"Yes\" \"What kind of drink?\"  \"A Coke. Could you make sure there are no tomatoes on that?\" \"Thanks. Your total is--\" \"I actually have a few more things to add to the order.\" After being interrupted after ever single item I add with a total, I return to my business and find my initial sandwich arrives with tomatoes. LOOK, I'm not expecting A LOT here, right? I'd have to be crazy. There's a reason why I write all my orders down--so I can be better at this than they are. The employees here are incredibly nice. I love that they separate out sandwiches with fries (one sandwich, one order of fries to each bag--whether or not they actually match in the way that I ordered). They do a pretty good job and the quality of food is consistent."}
{"text":"This spot dank at lunch.  Rec coming at 1145 or right after 1.  That 4 for 4 dolla combo with the double stack is the bombdotcomyo.  Shiiiiit that double stack is almost the perfect cheep burgerberg.  Its got the must have essentials -ketchup mustard pickle onion.  Like a proper backyard bbq burgeyburg at nana's house less the stupid pit bulls trying to get all up on you trying to snatch yo shit.  They named Max, Jojo and and Drake (she likes that sorry dude I cant tell her nothin) but I call them Dickhead #1 2 and 3.  Anyways that double stack by itself is 2.19 so with a drink 4 nuggets and some fries this is a super deal brah cuz 4.33 w tax.  Then you can even order your nuggets spicy?  Daaaaammmm son!  Get that honey mustard and dont play.  Why do diet coke taste so nasty on the reg but taste so good with meats and cheese.  Mystery of life.    For $4.33 im like 'Hello, maam.  Thank you for everything Mrs. Wendy. 5 stars for you!'"}
{"text":"You lucky I can't put negative 0 stars... Service is poor ... I know it's fastfood but if you hate your job... Get a new one... Do not take it out in paying customers. Fucking joke of a establishment... You guys give Wendy's a bad name!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is a fine enough fast food chain. I like that they have salads and baked potatoes, so if I'm not feeling like a burger and fries, I can still eat here on the run. And when it comes to burgers, their's aren't too terrible. In fact, I'd say they're better than other nationwide fast food chains. The fries are alright too. Hint: Get the ranch dipping sauce - it makes the fries even better. And, of course, there are the frosties. Special tip: Get a mini chocolate frosty and a mini vanilla frosty and mix them together. They also now offer ghost pepper fries. While tasty, they are basically just cheese fries with chopped jalapenos on top. If there were any ghost peppers involved, I didn't taste them. The fries were not spicy at all.  This particular location is...well...somewhat of a mess. Whether it's drive-thru or the counter inside, there's lots of miscommunication, incorrect charges, and inexplicable wait times. Check your receipt, your change, and your order thoroughly before leaving. And be wary of coupons as while they might save you money, they'll add significant wait time and confusion to your \"dining\" experience at this location."}
{"text":"Every time I go here it's an awful experience.  I can safely say this is the last time I patron this establishment.  15 min wait to order and I get fries that taste like they were cooked in Abraham Lincoln's oil.  Change ur dang grease!  Disgusting!  You have hosed me for the last time"}
{"text":"I do enjoy fast food from time to time.   I was not pleased with this trip.  I went the drive thru and there was a line. I ordered a 6 piece nugget and a jr hamburger.  I waited patiently and I got my food that I paid for . I went to the light and checked my bag. I had two sandwiches neither of which I ordered.   Do not go to this location unless you check the bag first.."}
{"text":"So ok its 102 am and theres am employee outside here... Weve been sitting here for about 5 mins... Really if you didnt want to sell us food before you closed you at least could have said something since you loomed at us while we were waiting..,."}
{"text":"Oh so tired of thinking they are going to give me a what i thought was a sour cream and chive potato which had no chives and was older than my morning coffee... This potato is so brown and nasty im pissed today. I get the same thing from wendys about three times a week. Maybe i need to go back to mcd's.... Too bad..."}
{"text":"About the same as other locations.  You get what you expect.  it is fast food but good.  The do have a value menu and there are coupons in the entertainment books.  The fries and the frosty are good."}

{"text":"I don't write fast food reviews often, because I don't really see the point. By definition they aren't fine dining and there usually isn't much of a reason to leave a rave review. So when I do review fast food joints, it's because they're extremely bad at what they do - and this Wendy's location is a prime example of that.  This spot used to be ok enough. I remember coming by with my family and having no serious problems getting a quick bite at all. These days, though, the staff definitely don't have their act together, and I guess management doesn't want to tell them so. I can't remember the last time I got out of their drive-thru lane in under 15 minutes. At first I thought maybe it was a fluke. Now it's become a long-term occurrence. The last time I came, they had the audacity to say \"We'll be with you in just a moment\" - twice! - and they left me hanging. Each. Time. I ended up staying just to see if they even remembered I was there. They did, after I sat so long that it would have been too long a wait at a sit-down restaurant, let alone in a fast food drive-thru line.  The only reason I keep coming here is because their food at least meets Wendy's standards and gives me something to keep me going between my appointments throughout the day. But based on other reviews, even this isn't always the case. Get in the line here at your own risk. Don't expect much. In fact, skip it altogether if you can, until other visitors can confirm that you won't wait as long as we currently do for our \"fast\" snacks and meals."}
{"text":"About the same as other locations.  You get what you expect.  it is fast food but good.  The do have a value menu and there are coupons in the entertainment books.  The fries and the frosty are good."}
{"text":"Is there a way to give half a star?  They are continually shocked they are selling food.  Very slow.  Food was okay this time.  The order was accurate.  I usually go to a Wendy's further away because of the lack of speed."}
{"text":"Waited for 15 minutes at the counter with nobody helping me. People in the back were yelling at eachother. Finally just walked out. I live across the street but everyone in my neighborhood avoids this place. Now i know why."}
{"text":"Tired, hungry, and craving a baked potato. My two kids and I were starving after school. We headed to the nearest Wendy's and satisfied our hunger for $16. We ordered 2 Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers, Baconator Fries, Bacon and Cheese Potato, Sour Cream and Chives Potato, 2 Chillis, and a large Strawberry Lemonade. We were all comfortably full after our meal. My son enjoyed playing with their awesome pop machine. Service was pleasant and fast."}
{"text":"Went thru drive-thru for chocolate frosty around 7pm tonight.   It was like chocolate milk not frozen at all.   Should have been informed by person at drive-thru that the Frosty's were not frozen yet.  Also was not given a receipt."}
{"text":"I have be to Wendy's several times. I have to say the cashier should just focus on the people in line and let the other people put the foods on the trays. It doesn't seem like they have enough cashier during  the lunch time hour when it's busy.   The staff is friendly. Almost over friendly.  Most of the time the place is clean."}
{"text":"I was served raw chicken and made repeated attempts for them to make it right but there was no response from upper management after she contacted me once and left a voicemail. I ordered the chicken go wraps and waited in the drive-thru for 10 minutes only to come home and find 2 out of 3 of them completely raw in the middle. Even though the 3rd looked cooked, I wanted to avoid the cross contamination. I will never eat at a Wendy's again. IF you don't want to get sick from food poisoning, I would advise against eating at this establishment on 51. Worst organization and management I have ever come into contact with."}
{"text":"My burger was literally dripping with grease.. You know when you batter chicken in flour before frying it? They batter their fries in salt before serving it. Disgusting. 0/10 will never return to this location. The employee taking my order was nice, the food was just bad."}
{"text":"This place is BAWLIN yo , Chicken nuggets be crispy like you never SEEN , I tasted one and was like WHAAAAT ? Are you serious Wendy ? Mean girls working at the frier doe , tryed to holla at one and she was like Nah , like yo ass was ugly anyways"}
{"text":"Usually I can expect a simple, cheap, and good meal from Wendy's. Unfortunately, this time cheap, cold, and barely edible describes our meal. The hamburgers were cold, the fries were limp, and the frosties were melted. The lettuce and tomatoes looked like leftovers pulled from the scrap pile. The person who helped us was distracted and seemed annoyed when I asked her to repeat back our order. This was a very disappointing visit and we probably will not return to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"Never ever again....something has changed here and it is not right....I'll spare the details but it took over 45 minutes to get a simple burger right....no less than half a dozen customers walked yesterday.  ..... like me, they won't be coming back.  Wendy's corporate office, this location is a liability to you, you should deal with management here as they are ruining your name....."}
{"text":"They really need to get it together. The cashier was rude and the food was old and cold. The only thing good about the whole meal was the frosty."}
{"text":"This store deserves a zero! I got a taco salad went home and realized they gave me No chili no sour cream. So I called 3 times no one answered of course! So I got back in my car and went back down to the store.  Went inside and told them they forgot to give me my chili and sour cream. Here is the best part.. I was told \" Oh yeah we ran out of chili\" Really?! Like it was no big deal!! Really so I paid for lettuce!!?  Even after I said I was very unhappy nothing was done! I WILL NEVER WASTE MY MONEY THERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is rude when it's near time to close and they don't honor the times as advertised"}
{"text":"Nice  atmosphere, newer look with a fire place and TV. I like Wendy's fries perfect size. The #2 medium size. Customer service is ok, I have not had ant issues. It's  been clean every time I've  stopped  by."}
{"text":"I was starving.  I saw the poor reviews, yet I was to the point of starvation that I was contemplating chewing on my arm which is why I came here.  I am glad I did because my food was fresh, hot and tasty.  I had the spicy chicken sandwich.  Customer service was friendly.  Yes the prices are higher than a regular Wendy's, but you are at the airport.  It's to be expected."}
{"text":"Keep in mind there's only one car ahead of me and no one inside being waited on. Waited at the order screen for over a minute before I was greeted. Took my order finally. Then silence for maybe another minute. She then repeated my order asking if that was what I wanted. I said yes but without tomatoes. Another 2 minutes of silence. I finally said hello and she repeated the order again. I agreed then ordered two more sandwiches. The order finally came up on the screen. I had to again remind them to remove the tomato. Did not greet me as I pulled to the window. Just reached for my debit card.   Waited another few minutes till they opened up the window and asked if the gave me back my debit card. They did. At least the order was correct."}
{"text":"The thing that stands out about this particular store from all the other big chain fast food stores is the self-serve touch screen drink machine with over 100 options. Never seen this before, I thought it was pretty awesome! The other thing is the people watching - there are definitely some interesting people who frequent here. Otherwise it's just your standard run of the mill Wendy's. It's probably worth mentioning they got my order wrong (although I guess I didn't *really* need that upgrade to poutine, and my wallet and waistline thanked me). And my fries were over salted. But my burger was perfection and I'll come back again and again because noone else gots the Baconator!!"}
{"text":"For over 6 months it's always slow. No matter what time of day or week we go, it takes more than 20 min to get a $5 order. I have spoken to the manager on multiple occasions. Nothing changes. They also regularly get orders wrong and food stinks. And the place stinks like a sewer trap. Plus it's always 50 degrees inside this place. It's so cold l, I can't wait 5 minutes inside the restaurant, without shivering. Dont bother with this location. Thank you"}
{"text":"Sunday must be training day! They had no idea what I order buy the time I got to the second window it's getting really sad at this location.."}
{"text":"The manager is nice but that's the only redeeming factor about this place. I came in with a family of 7 with a relatively normal order. A few sandwiches, some fries, some chili, and 2 salads. If it's a small order they'll be fine but they didn't get anything right on the order. My sandwich, which was just a cheeseburger, came out with a bun that was as hard as a brick and some black stuff they wanted to pass as bacon. They finally took care of this but only after 15 minutes of waiting. Feel free to come if it's a small order but otherwise stay away."}
{"text":"This location is close to work and notorious for taking a VERY long time to get through the lunch line. I made it there by 11:30a and the line formed behind me and took forever to get through. I just ordered an Asian Chicken Salad and water. This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry, expect a long wait to get through. A coworkers salad (garden salad) had wilted lettuce in it."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. Absolute shit..... screw you guys, learn how to do your freaking job."}
{"text":"The girl's that work the window have no idea about what good customer service is whatsoever. Super unfriendly.  We ordered a few things and everything was decent except for the jr cheeseburger was seriously so cold. It literally wasn't hot one bit. But I'm not one to go try and get refunded a dollar. I'll just stick to the milkshakes here."}
{"text":"Wow, terrible customer service where the manager tells you to get out when the order was given wrong to me . No aplology, no respect, nothing."}
{"text":"Stopped on the way home to get some food for the wife and I ......everything was mostly good ...Fries weren't cooked all the way and they forgot my chicken nuggets ...In the grand scheme of things just go somewhere else this isn't worth it unless you are hell bent on something from Wendys"}
{"text":"I love Wendy's but will next time go to one of the other locations within the city when I get a craving for a frosty.  The staff is a little harsh, my order was not right and the fries were cold.  Text book failure.  I might have gotten them at the wrong time so will try again and hopefully they will redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Wendy's is my go-to fast food restaurant, but this location is off my list. I keep giving it chances because of its proximity to my place, but no more. The owner has made it clear to his management team to nickel and dime the customers at every opportunity. I know this because the employees relayed it to me on two separate occasions.  No substitutions on any discount offer. This is in keeping with headquarters, but this is the only Wendy's I know of that maintains that policy.  More ice put into drinks than any fast food place I know of. I have to constantly ask for no-ice or else I get no-drink.  Scrimps on bacon toppings as compared to other Wendy's restaurants.  Does not maintain washrooms to the level of other Wendy's restaurants.  The list goes on and on, but it may sound too petty. All said though, never again."}
{"text":"I love the new modern format fast food restaurants are going to so that aspect was a treat for me. The food was pretty dry though, which is unfortunate because Wendy's is usually my go to for a fast food burger. Need to not have food sitting out so long."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! They are false advertising. I ordered a small frosty that was stated to be $1. The manager argued with me and refused to lower the price. If corporate knew that their board was incorrect and they were charging more, they would be in huge trouble. You can't advertise one price and charge the customer more. I will not be returning just to make a point and not give my business to a company that doesn't honor their advertised prices. That is taking advantage of their customers! You lost some local business!"}
{"text":"Terrible staff.  Drive thru order took about 20 min. for about 4 items off the value menu.  We were one of two people in line.  Pull up to the window and see 4 people standing around with our food just waiting to be bagged up.  The guy who took our payment disappeared for about 5 minutes and finally came back to bag it up.  Pretty confusing situation"}
{"text":"Just went here with my boyfriend and the service could not have been more horrible. The guy who took our order first of all told me the amount was 14.35, I handed him 20.35 and even asked him if this was the correct change, he said yes. He proceeded to hand me back 5.82. So, my bill was 14.53, not 14.35. Secondly, the same cashier put our two burgers on the tray and left the tray sitting there for a good 6-7 MINUTES before anyone even asked us what we were waiting on. Oh! The best part is even the manager glanced up at us a few times and did not even bother to walk 3 steps and ask us what we were waiting on. Then, when we did get our fries, nobody apologized. Needless to say, I will never be back here again, and some of the employees obviously need better training, or education."}
{"text":"I have always loved Wendy's food. This location has recently been remodeled. One major plus is the self service Coke freestyle machine in the dining room."}
{"text":"No point in ordering what you want, they just give you what they think you want or half of what you ordered. The drive thru girl don't understand plain soon as u say plain u can expect it to be fully loaded with all of what you didn't want. They also can't count so best to pay debit or credit"}
{"text":"I was only digging into the pot of chili because the treasure map ended at the bottom of the pot it was clearly marked on there map and I would have shown the manager but I was ejected before I had the chance.  This should be a four star review, not a five star and you know it. No spicy nuggets.  See you next week."}
{"text":"It is completely crazy how amazing the people that work here are.  If there was an Olympic Sport in fast food, these people would win.  They can take 4 orders at once, with various methods of payment in between, prepare your order, smile and give change and NEVER screw ANYTHING up!    Its like the triathalon, but with food.  And to top it all off...they are really pleasant.  Which is amazing because its the financial district, and its lunchtime, and its BUSY.  These guys never lose their cool...and its awesome.    You know its scary when the manager knows your order, and comments when you wear glasses instead of contacts, and he probably serves 1000+ people a day.  Love it!"}
{"text":"I have frequently been to this location because it is close to my home. I normally spend any where from $15-25 a trip because of my family size. I had a horrible customer service experience with Ebony (Manager) and June (cashier). I reported to Lisa the area manager via email and she apologized and said that she would leave a gift card for me. The receipt number I complained about was provided to her so she could confirm the people that handled my meal. The total on the receipt was $21+. She left a $10 gift card. Needless to say, I will not be spending my hard earned money there anymore.   OAN: Brandon (another manager) is awesome and was the only reason why I went to that location in the first place.  Beware: Even the area manager doesn't know how to resolve customer complaints."}
{"text":"Okay location.  The sandwiches were fresh but not the fries.  I had to wait in the drive thru for about five minutes but once I placed my order,  the end process was smooth.  Now, back to the fries.  It is not that difficult to provide fresh fries to customers.  I don't understand what the issue is and Wendy's has definitely taken a nose dive in quality over the past five years.   The prices went up but everything else went down.  :("}
{"text":"I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich today. Although it filled my empty stomach, the lettuce was old and aged, the bun was soggy, and the chicken was dry. I would not recommend this particular location to anyone, although other Wendy's locations I have attended have been superb. Hopefully this doesn't happen again. Much love   T"}
{"text":"Will never eat there again my food was cold and made incorrectly and the manager had the worse work ethic and inappropriate attitude worse Wendy's in the state."}
{"text":"Wendy's is my favorite fast food chain but this one I will avoid at all costs.  My mistake was heading out as they were closing but it's no excuse for serving flat Come with no ice.  The fries did not come with ketchup, I just assumed they would put them in the bag, I barely are them since they had a weird taste.  Last and least was the double burger which was a soggy mess. The bread could barely contain the meat and I had to eat it piece by piece.  Get there much earlier than midnight to be able to complain in person if you get subpar food and service."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for an employee named David. He is not only efficient and friendly, but took such good care of everyone who came into his store  The stand out moment was an older woman with a walker ordering some lunch. David took her order. Walked her to a seat and offered to bring her her tray. On top of that he brought her mustard and ketchup and came by to refill her drink.  He had consistent people trying to order but took time for the elderly. David if I had any cash I would has tipped you and made sure you really understand that your efforts do not go unnoticed. Thank you for going above and beyond!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here for the first time today. The burger was exactly what I expected but the fries were pretty limp and had obviously been sitting for a while. Unlike other Wendy's restaurants, at this location the drink dispenser is \"behind the counter\". My drink had so much ice in it (the cup was actually filled all the way to the top with ice) I had trouble getting the straw in. After drinking what little liquid was in the cup I dumped out two thirds of the ice and got a refill. I really hate the practice of overfilling the cups with ice. I will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"I had not been to this location for several month but decided to have lunch there today. The lady taking my order seemed pretty indifferent and did not seem to care whether I was there or not. I was surprised to learn that Wendy's is now providing 16 oz cups with small combos rather than the industry standard 21 oz cup. Instead of refilling a 21 oz cup once I refilled the 16 oz cup twice. Since I had more to drink using the 16 oz cup than I would have using a 21 oz cup, the restaurant actually lost a bit of money on the deal. In addition, they had a slightly dissatisfied customer. I am not sure that I will be visiting Wendy's again."}
{"text":"The man in the drive thru literally has got to be the most absolute disgusting person working for a company I have ever encountered in my life, constantly rude and I have been there 3 times as well and every time I get the same exact thing a number 6 medium with no mayo, and I get mayo on my sandwich every time he's working and no straws!!! Corporate really needs to visit this store and fire him immediately! He's the white morbidly obese male I'm sure there's not anyone else working of his size because it's the biggest I've seen able to move from a bed period. He's so damn busy being rude to everyone he can't even get the order right! I am definitely never returning because the amount of trash that works in the establishment is ridiculous, I know there's is not only one person with a headset on either so I'm sure someone making the food hears me every time and still just doesn't care to make sure it's correctly rang in or even apologize for any miscommunications...."}
{"text":"Every time i go there they are rude and something is always missing from my order . Sick of it . I know start hiring nice people !!!! The nice people are out there  just not at this wendys.. only getting one star because i have to  not an option not to give any stars"}
{"text":"I went there at around 6 o'clock and it wasn't very busy. Instead of cleaning and making sure the condiment area was full they weren't doing anything. The floor was full of wrappers and food. They were out of napkins and ketchup. As we waited on line the place got even busier and things fell apart from there. Plus the garbage was overflowing."}
{"text":"Its waste of money here. All they serve along with your burger is Lettuce and Tomatoes with any burger which is pre-heated before serving you.  You staffs are lazy and they just stand there doing nothing but giving you pre-heated stuffs. Food taste horrible. If you have to get food from them ASK them to make Fresh for you. Its worth waiting 10-15mins then eating pre-heated stuffs. Make Sure you find all veggies in your burger. :("}
{"text":"I absolutely love Wendy's burgers. My very favorite is the bacon Ater. Can't beat the chocolate smoothies either. However this particular Wendy's has real management issues. This is the second visit in a row where they're out of french fries. They also seem very disorganized for example there were three orders waiting and lost. They need help. I want them to improve and succeed."}
{"text":"I salute the employees of this location for putting up with rowdy UNCC undergrads (I should know, I was one).  Unforgivable:  Leaving the PATTY off the hamburger.  Imagine eagerly unwrapping your burger at home, only to find a bun, lettuce, tomato, and ketchup.  Tragic.  Forgetting a condiment or a special request, okay, but the patty?  THE PATTY?!  It's been 7 years since this happened and I'm still not over it."}
{"text":"If there was an option for ZERO this would've been it. My boyfriend and I went in for the Portobello mushroom burger during lunch...he orders it and was told they run out of the bread. We ask if there was anything for our inconvenience....the MANAGER comes out and says no. He says they ran out and can't discount the meal. He didn't even apologize for not having the bread. Fine we said. I ordered the 10 pieces nugget instead.  The food came out cold and the nuggets taste like it's been sitting out since this morning.  Bad service!..,check!  Cold food!...check!  Not coming to this location again."}
{"text":"I came in with my two kids and we ordered food. I had ordered kids meals for them and I ordered the fresh mozzarella chicken sandwich. They made it with the wrong kind of chicken (she realized that as she gave it to me so she took it back). I waited for 15 minutes before they came to tell me that they were out of what I ordered. I asked if I could get my money back and they had me talk to who I assume is the manager on duty. He continued to have personal conversations with staff about his phone being broken as I was waiting to speak to him. I asked him if I could get my money back for the items they were out of and for my fries since they were cold and gross from waiting for my meal. He got a slight attitude with me and gave me a half ass apology. I hope this location can fix their issues and become more organized. It didn't used to be like this."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this Wendys 0 stars I went a couple days ago and it was 30 minutes before closing time. I ordered a double cheeseburger meal and my food was cold the fries were soggy as if they were old my meat was not cooked throughly and it was cold the drive thru worker was a dark skinned female there was a car behind us and her head set was beeping for her to take the other customers order and she said \"you've got to be fucking kidding me\" and I heard a guy inside in the kitchen yell something out as if all the workers just wanted to close already. I wasted my money with the poor service and poor food service! It was so disappointing and I'm beyond pissed that I wasted money on food that was old and not to mention not cooked throughly!"}
{"text":"Waited in the drive through for twenty minutes, only 1 car in front of us and nobody in the lobby only to get our food cold. Defiantly don't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say won't visiting this dump again! The tables are so sticky, i felt like i'd catch a disease. The service is so slow. The attitudes are ignorant to say the least and the music is not wendy's music. They place obscene music using fowl language. I never again will go to this Wendy's maybe time to fire whole staff including GM and start fresh or shut it down and lay off the workers."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. You get ignored at the drive thru window and when you go inside, it's not any better!"}
{"text":"This location has the worst employees and customer service! Every single time I have gone to this location, I am rudely treated.The staff is poorly trained. The managers do not know how to manage. When I alerted the manager to the service we received, he never apologized. Instead, he claimed the girl was just \"having a bad day.\"  Terrible!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would !!! Picked up my food threw the drive thru so didn't  know til I got home that our soda were watered down and flat !!! When they gave us our frosties they didn't look like a cup of ice cream it looked like chocolate milk . When I got home and ate my food it had a bad taste to it . (Baconator). And now I've been regretting  the last 2 days! !! So sick. WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS LOCATION! ! Might not ever eat at Wendy's the way I feel ."}
{"text":"Second time getting sick. This time, puking for 24hrs on end. Nothing before, nothing after, just drinking water and immediately sick afterwards. avoid..."}
{"text":"I was calling Wendy's to see if they could sponsor my YouTube stream and someone named Jeff picked up and said hello and I said \"I have a YouTube channel and- then he said \"who are you\" and I said a caller then he said \"bye\" and hung up. So I called back and asked why he had hung up on me and he said \"who are you\" again and I said \"a caller, I'm calling Wendy's.\" Then he said \"we have a thing where we can send numbers to the police and they can get in touch with you because you are prank calling.\" Then I said \"im not prank calling im asking if you could possibly sponsor my stream?\" Then he said \"shut up\" and stop calling me.  Bad Review"}
{"text":"Great start, opening day and the guys are kicking butts and taking names (for your order). Better bet we'll be back many times!"}
{"text":"I have a single leaf of lettuce on my Dave's Triple. This new owner is failing just as bad as the last."}
{"text":"The guy at the drive thru window @ 5:15 this evening has NO PERSONALITY OR COMMON COURTESIES. (dark hair, thin). Who trained this kid?"}
{"text":"One word: horrible. Everything about it, especially the staff. Uninterested, unfriendly and they did their very best to make me feel unwelcome. Icing on the cake: chicken biscuit was awful."}
{"text":"Serve raw chicken sandwiches, and when confronted about it, the manager does not apologize, tells me if I want to drive back 15min, they will remake it. Horrible location with oily not fresh fries in addition to the raw undercooked meat."}
{"text":"Chicken was tougher than a steak, asked for no sauce, indicated on the ticket. Guess what I got?  Sauce. The employees also don't seem very friendly. No smiles anywhere. I avoid this place as much as I can."}
{"text":"Service is so bad, and the lines are so long that I've been here 3 times and have never had a meal here.  Sloooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow  Good luck.  I couldn't wait the 20 min"}
{"text":"Was in there today again and the service is excellent. Is this a chica fila or Wendy's I can't tell the difference except for the menu. Cashiers will bring your food to you. Manager actually has respect for the customer instead of ignoring them. I love it!"}
{"text":"I went and the lady thru the speaker in drive thru was so rude and I'm like lady i don't know I'm just reading a text message of what someone wanted didn't know you no longer serve that item. Then I find a long piece of curly black hair on my wrapper. Just disgusting"}
{"text":"After waiting in line just to get a token to use the restroom, a rude employee approached me on the way out of the restroom, then I had to wait in line all over again just to order. Shortly after that, I watched a grandmother experience the same thing with her grandson."}
{"text":"The bushes cover up sign so it was difficult to spot! Additionally, when I asked for no cheese on my side salad they said they \"don't do that\" and the salads come premade. However other locations have honored my request. Utterly ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went during lunch on a Sunday, there were three customers in the restaurant and I had to wait over ten minutes for a couple of chicken sandwiches because they had a \"rush\". They put the fries out and then had to wait for the sandwiches so the fries got cold. No apologies for the wait. Have to have them get you refills and restrooms open into the eating area."}
{"text":"Their drive thru service at night is horrible. The lady was being rude to us and gave us hard chicken nuggets that were like rocks. I'm never going back to that place."}
{"text":"As I was writing a horrible, hideous review of one of the Wendy's in Gastonia on Saturday, it occurred to me that I should give props to the Wendy's that is consistent and delicious.  This is the Wendy's in Stanley.  I don't think I've had any problems at this particular Wendy's.  The drive-thru line goes pretty smoothly no matter what time of day I've been there and the employees there are very friendly!  And, most importantly, no one takes a bite out of our food before they hand it to us! (See my review of the Wendy's in Gastonia for details.)  I have to give credit where credit is due, and this Wendy's is the ONLY Wendy's in this area I'll frequent from now on!  It's a longer drive for us, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"There was a bite in my daughter's sandwich!  We got Wendy's today at this location.  When my daughter opened her sandwich, there was already a child-sized bite taken OUT of her sandwich!  Called the manager and got a woman with a SEVERE attitude problem!  Husband took the sandwich back only for this chick with an attitude called us LIARS!  Yeah, we're going to travel all that way to scam 3 bucks!  NEVER, EVER AGAIN!  Sorry customer service and pre-chewed food?  NO THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Officially crossing this Wendy's off of my list. I've been here multiple times and they always either 1. Miss something, 2. Screw up my order, 3. The food is luke warm (I do not wait to take it home, I typically eat it right in the parking lot, too), and/or 4. Haphazardly throw toppings/condiments on my items. Hey, I know it's not supposed to look like the picture on the board, but it shouldn't look like it was thrown across the room and reassembled...."}
{"text":"I feel kinda like a dweeb writing a Yelp review for Wendy's but I just have to give props where props are due.  This Wendy's just recently went through a major renovation, and it definitely shows!! Not only is the inside GORGEOUS, but the food is fresher, the customer service better, faster, and friendlier, but coming to Wendy's feels almost like going to a regular restaurant.  Well, maybe not quite, but at least on par with a Panara Bread.   When I walked inside, I was a little overwhelmed because everything looked so different. Comfy chairs, lounge areas, flat screen tvs, even a faux fireplace greeted me.  My eyes actually had to adjust because this was not what I was expecting in a Wendy's.  Everything was spotless, with not a random cup or piece of trash in sight. Once I finally figured out where to go to place my order, the cashier was so nice and conversational that it actually took me aback.  My order was ready and complete before I even finished preparing my drink (they have one of those new fangled soda dispensers with 100+ varieties of beverages), and it was hot, fresh, and tasty.  My drive-thru experience was similarly pleasant.  They only have one window now, but they must have more people working the drive-thru, because I had absolutely no wait time- as soon as I handed over my money, there was someone there handing me my food.  Hopefully, this is not just a fluke because of the new look and will be consistent. For the meantime, I'm sold!"}
{"text":"With their \"fresh salad commercials\" playing every minute on TV I thought I'd try Wendy's new salads.   Not worth the detour! This is the same prepackaged type of salad that you'd get from a McDonald's.   I'd rather pay 3-4 dollars more and get a real fresh salad. And for the rest of the food...well it's Wendy's, so if your into junk food they are as good as the others. Not better or worse.   Then they say they offer free wifi but I tried connecting and it didn't work. I asked for help but no one really seemed to care. A woman with a red shirt came out, she might have been the manager. She didn't offer any additional help and kind of shrugged me off as a nuisance for interrupting the normal flow of whatever was occupying her time.   Great customer service - NOT!   Disappointed in Tempe PS: As I'm writing this, the cashier, an older man named Michael, came to me to apologize and explain the technical problem. Thanks Michael. Nice customer care. Much appreciated."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this Wendy's.   I had dinner here with my son.  I have to say without a doubt this is the nicest Wendy's I have ever been in.  My son met me there and when he walked in he said the same thing.  The service was great, the food was good and the restaurant was very clean.  It was really nice because we could watch the news while we ate.  We will definitely be back to this Wendy's.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"I like the staff, but the place is terribly slow. The worst is the bad shape of the men's room. It raises food safety concerns and makes me not want to go there again."}
{"text":"Dropped by at 12:01 AM. Received product at 12:10 AM. Burger was barely warm and very dry. So much for \"hot-and-juicy\". The person at the window asked me if I wanted a receipt. I bet they were hoping I would say no. The evidence of when I placed the order was there. Doesn't everyone get a receipt without asking? What a joke. This franchise should be closed ASAP. I contacted Wendy's corporate. They are gonna take your store away soon :)"}
{"text":"I went thru the drive thru to get the new chicken tenders and I wouldn't give this place a star at all the fries are really old nd the tenders you can't even bite into definitely will not be going back waste of time nd money"}
{"text":"I ordered a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger and within an hour of consuming the sandwich, I was violently vomiting! I called the Corporate HQ to let them know and when a rep called me back, he asked me \"what do you want from us\"! My reply was \"food that is safe to eat!\" Not so coincidently, 3 other individuals I know who live in other states, also had the same issue from the same sandwich in the same week! All of us had large blood vessels in our eyes burst (I have pictures to prove this) and it didn't clear up for 3 weeks! We all were unable to eat solid food for almost a week after the incidents! I NEVER heard back on the results of the investigation Wendy's was supposedly going to make into the problem! Therefor, my family and friends will NEVER eat at Wendy's again!"}
{"text":"I really feel like it's my duty to warn others that if you come to this Wendy's to please bring your patience. Please don't stop here for a quick bite or if you're in a rush. The people here work at their own pace. They are all very friendly, but this area is full of retirees and quite a few of them work here. They will chat with you all day about various things, but you have to be willing to give about 10 minutes more of your time whenever you place an order.   I repeat this specific Wendy's is not a \"fast\" food joint, but my order here is always right.  :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here to pick up a quick bite on my way home.  Decided to try the new chicken sandwich they've been advertising, sans tomatoes (eww).  Chicken was dryyy.  And my light lemonade tastes a bit too light - as in it was watered down.  The fries were OK.  It sort of tasted like I got the leftovers from the lunch rush since my visit was a little after 4.  Blah.  At least they were nice.  This experience does remind me why I don't frequent Wendy's, though.  Oh, well."}
{"text":"Since the boo doesn't like Wendy's, I have to go solo when I want some and this location is very close to my work.  I was in a hurry back after running an errand and decided to stop here for a quick pick-up lunch to take back to the office.  The drive-thru attendant was very nice and polite - much more so than what I'm used to anywhere.  The wait was not bad at all even with a couple of cars in front of me and the nice gentleman who took my card and handed me my order was very pleasant.  The food is Wendy's.  I think they've improved their fries some, so that's a bonus.  And it's one of the few places that has Light Lemonade left!  I always order that if that's an option somewhere - In-n-Out still has it but McDonald's took it off the menu.  Definitely look forward to visiting again when the craving arises. -:)"}
{"text":"It was on par. Nothing too special at this location other than their uber cool drink dispenser, which I notice some restaurants are popping up with. You know those retro ice box looking machines that dispenses ice cubes and then a gazillion types of drinks from various brands. It's fun, but if the touch sensitive screen fails or picks a different drink .... It kinda gets annoying if the line starts to build up. Makes you wonder what happened to the good old fashioned fountain dispensers. Hey that's technology for you. Haha...my little on topic off topic rant.   Over all this Wendy's location was quiet for a Saturday lunch afternoon.  Went here with a couple friends while taking our CCW class & service was fairly quick, being we were like 3 groups of customers. Inside was nicely up kept and clean. Outside was clean as well and parking was a plenty. The area can get a little sketchy especially at night due to it's location of Tropicana & Dean Martin.  Fairly close to the Las Vegas strip, but just far enough for the crazies to roam around the streets. Yet it's fairly safe especially if you are with other people & mosey on to your own business.  I assume this place gets packed more on weekdays during lunch time with all the business and industrial buildings around the area.  Even for its location, it is fairly accessible and close to the I-15 freeway too. It's not a hole in one, but it is on par with what you would expect a Wendy's to be."}
{"text":"Yeah, I know, it's a Wendy's. What should I expect?  How about at least getting *something* right on my order? You know, *anything*.  I order a grilled chicken sandwich, large fries, and a large chocolate frosty. The person at the counter says, \"$2.13\".   Hey, I'm all for a great discount, but given that the frosty pushes two bucks alone, something was amiss.  No translator was available, but we managed to figure out she'd charged me for the 99 cent \"crispy chicken\" sandwich, no fries and a small frosty.  So she re-rang it, correctly I assumed.  I get my bag o' food, and she plops down not a frosty, but a soft drink. Whatever, I'm kinda in a hurry, so I just grabbed it and left. This is after all, \"fast food\", I was freaking starving and just wanted to get out.  In the car I find I got not a chicken sandwich, but a hamburger. And not large fries, but a small order.  The burger was, Wendy's. The fries, Wendy's. The soda, diet (which I think tastes like feet).  I've eaten a LOT of fast food in my time, but I don't recall ever having EVERYTHING wrong."}
{"text":"I have definitely seen an improvement with employees in the last 6 months. But, why do they make you pull forward and wait for your food every time!?! Even if no one is currently behind you they still make you pull forward and wait by the door. I understand they may need some extra time to cook the food, but they do this every single time I come here. It's never just ready when you pull up, like every other fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Drive thru was fast, big order was correct, food was fresh and the guy, Dionte is probably the hottest fast food worker I've ever encountered.  He might just be the reason why Wendy's will continue gaining my business.  Lol"}
{"text":"Just waited almost 15 minutes in drive thru. Lady in a red car was or wasn't ordering. She keep on looking back at the other cars with a smile on her face. As if her friend was working inside and thought it would be funny to take her time. I finally order and the young lady didn't have very good customer service. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I was told their sever was down and couldn't take any orders. They couldn't do the manual back up plan."}
{"text":"Big time regular here. Drive through is horrendously slow.   If you walk in your experience and wait time is solely dependent on the cashier. If you get an experienced cashier you are usually in and out in no time. BUT if you get a newbie cashier (60% of the time) be prepared to wait for about 15 minutes!!!   Never had any issues with the food however, so that's the silver lining."}
{"text":"Rita, the store manager and Karen, the hostess are wonderful. We received wonderful customer services from them. Karen was extremely helpful and so sweet. We are new to Arizona and recently moved in the neighborhood. Will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Free wifi, plugs, good service  For Wendy's, this is one of the best.  Light jazz playing in the background, and a nice young lady will even bring you a mint after your meal"}
{"text":"fast and fantastic   for all the worry that you can't have fast food as well as good food, the wendy's double burger i just housed, put the concern to rest... the patties were not thin thawed out slices of meat, each layer of beef was thick and juicy and tasted like something you'd cook at home in the backyard with your family and friends.. It was not only filling, it felt clean.    ***we all need to find a way to limit the waste we typically add, unnecessarily when dining out"}
{"text":"The drive thru is beyond slow. It took 10 mins to order and now I'm sitting behind a car waiting to pay for another 10 minutes and unfortunately the gentleman at the window didn't even apologize for the ridiculous wait."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is not the best one in town, but the staff here is really sweet.  My co-workers and I go to Wendy's every Friday.  It is nice when you walk in the door and they say hi to us by name. Then when you order your food they already know what we would like to order.     The location of this Wendy's is across for the VA hospital.  So you will see a lot of doctors or nurse here and sometime patients.  I will say that this Wendy's could use a makeover.  Hopefully one day they will, and then people may want to actually eat here."}
{"text":"I am curious if this is a concept store or if I have not been a Wendy's for a long time. From automated ordering, touch screen fountain drinks, a feng shui lay out, gas picture fireplace, higher quality tables and chairs, big screen television and serving your order on the tray as if it was a piece of art, this location exceeded my expectations. Even my JBC inside the wrapper was perfect. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because at the end of the day it is still a fast food chain."}
{"text":"Updated interior that looks quite nice!  I visited this Wendy's not too long ago as part of yet another bike ride.  What can one say about a fast-food restaurant, really?  Prices are inexpensive, especially the value menu, food is consistent with others in the same chain (as expected), and there are actually healthy options which eases the guilt in purchasing and consuming fast-food.  This Wendy's has a cool soda pop dispenser that elevates the acquisition of your carbonated beverage to quasi-video-game status...sort of.  The buttons on the interactive screen make it fun to get your drink, IMO, but I guess I'm just nerdy.  Anyway, I was happy to visit and refuel for the rest of my bike ride back to the west side of town."}
{"text":"Used drive-thru at 4:10 p.m. on Monday. Placed my order at the speaker and before I could finish my sentence the employee cut me off and told me to pull forward. Didn't get a Hello or any kind of greeting was just bark the amount I owed and window shut the second I handed her my card. The window opened again and I was handed my card and my receipt and the window immediately shut. She seemed to be too engage in a conversation with a coworker than to focus on me as a customer. The window opened again I was handed my bag once again window just shut. This is the third time I've been to this Wendy's and I don't think I'm going to return. Seems to be the same situation every time I go."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and fresh food. I think the whole process only took about 5 minutes. It kind of blows my mind if you think about it. The sandwich really did taste made to order. Maybe they knew I was coming... Can the fine folks at Wendy's read minds?! Regardless, I'm happy. Less time in line means more time to enjoy my lunch break.   The fries could have been cooked a bit longer to make them crispier, but overall I was happy. I got a crispy, hot and juicy chicken sandwich with mayo and pickles, and my co-worker got the chicken mozzarella salad. She did say she wasn't impressed with the pesto on the salad, but loved the rest. Everything was very fresh."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for their darn service, I'd give this 4, maybe even 5 stars! As far as fast food places go, Wendy's has pretty good food, but probably the worst service, and this one is not an exception.  I was at the airport a little hungry and looking for some fast food that would not scratch my throat. Maybe it was not the best choice, but I remember Wendy's baked potatoes with chili were nice and soft on the inside, almost mashed potato like in texture, so I got that. Well, when I sat down, I noticed instead of \"baked potato with chili cheese\" like I said, they gave me \"chili cheese fries.\" I'm sorry, but how can you hear that incorrectly?!? The  person who took my order fulfilled my order, and that was literally the ONLY thing I got!! Plus, I'm always very cheery when interacting with others. I didn't even get a smile from him :(  So after scratching my throat with fries because I couldn't muster up the energy to go back, I'm typing this review on my phone. Don't get me wrong, the chili cheese fries were actually quite delicious if it wasn't for the constant coughing. Just be aware of going to this Wendy's (or ANY Wendy's) and make sure you check your order before you leave. That's something I keep forgetting to do...  By the way, I order the chili and cheese baked potato all the time at various Wendy's around the US. Half the time, I get bacon and cheese, and of course, this time I got fries. Also, half the time they actually do get my order right, the potato is all dry and NOT that lovely mashed potato texture I love. Talk about frustrating!"}
{"text":"I got the most disgusting looking taco salad in my entire life today. I couldn't even eat it and the staff laughed at me when I asked for something else. I'm not a picky eater or someone who would ever return food, but this taco salad was just too much."}
{"text":"Great new remodel. Food is good and a better atmosphere than before. The only thing that sucks is the wifi only 1 MB download speeds... really sucks"}
{"text":"Just wanted a Frosty so this was the closest place to satisfy my urge!  This location was busy and it took about 5 minutes to get to the order counter.  After that, service fulfilment was quick and staff (...I believe it was the store owner) was courteous.  I chose a vanilla $0.99 Frosty special.  The large seating area is jointly shared with Tim Hortons.  Two wide-screen TV's are attached to opposite sides of a centre pillar for your viewing pleasure.  There are also 4 comfy chairs on each side if you don't want to sit on wooden chairs.  Booth seating is also available.  Since the place is about 75% full, the general noise level is elevated.  You can hang out with friends and plug your devices such as phone chargers into a few wall receptacles available for customers.  There's a drive-thru and free WiFi too!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. All I wanted to order was 2 \"son of baconator\" sandwiches for $4.79 each and a grilled chicken sandwich. No combos, just sandwiches. Vincent took our order and charged me for 2 regular baconator sandwiches which were $2 more per sandwich. I told him three times that he was charging me for the wrong item. He obviously couldn't comprehend that, so finally I just gave up and took what he rang me up for. The manager on duty wasn't any more help when I addressed it with her. I'm not a huge fan of Wendy's anyway, but for $6 a burger, I'll go across the street to Caveman Burgers any get a much better product."}
{"text":"I don't usually feel compelled to review fast food, but this Wendy's location has disappointed me so many times, it deserves a review.  It fails at the primary goal of eating a CHAIN fast food restaurant: consistency.    Depending on when you go there, you might get  a great burger or an almost cold one where the cheese isn't even going to melt.  The staff, as nice as most of them are, seem overworked, frantic at times and poorly trained.  Asking them for a baked potato sometimes elicits a response akin to having asked them to predict the next set of lottery numbers.   This is an example of how to do a Wendy's franchise in the WRONG way.  I don't blame the kids who work there, I blame the management and franchise (?) owners."}
{"text":"They have the soda fountain dispenser that let's you choose ANY SODA. Fast food places can be hit or miss, but this Wendy's is one of the nicer ones I've been to.  Good job Wendy's, but you still need to work on those stale fries"}
{"text":"I never post but I feel that posting may help as this Wendy's really needs an improvement in management. Young kids working are under utilized and under managed. I'm not sure management is ever present because I find it hard to believe the service could be this bad if it was. The drive thru has taken 30 minutes the past two times we have visited."}
{"text":"This Wendy's takes credit cards, which is a plus.  The staff here is very friendly, so they earn an extra star for their attitude and the consistency of the Spicy chicken sandwich (the only thing I ever order).  Keep in mind that three stars for a Wendy's means that it is slightly above average for fast food.  Not food in general."}
{"text":"Totally screwed my order up at the register. I ordered a double stack with fries and a tea got charged for a Dave's double large combo. They had already charged my card so i stead of crediting the card they did math on paper and gave me some money back. Then when i get the order it is just a double stack no fries or drink. I had to then order drink and a fry. Ended up costing me more had i just left it alone in the first place. I told them it was wrong monetarily but they didn't seem to care. What a rip off."}
{"text":"Do you like waiting 30 minutes for fast food? If you do then this is your place! There is usually little veto no lines in this place but you will always have to wait for the simplest orders.  The cashiers are always screwing around on their phones which they have laying on the register in full view.   The place sucks.  Drive over the bridge and get chic film a because their service is much better and you don't have to hear employees swearing or using racial slurs."}
{"text":"This is the nicest, cleanest and friendliest fast food restaurant I've ever been in. Wow. Clean clean clean! Highly recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is understaffed.   Neex 3 more employees.  Slow is kind to describe service here.   No smiles either.   If the line has 15 people expect a 25 minute wait.   Food is Wendy's."}
{"text":"Typical Wendy's grub. Certainly better than BK and McD's but still nothing to write home about... I bumped the rating up a star (2 to 3) simply because of the location, fast service and reasonable prices (for an airport). Expect 2 star food with 3 star service in an airport, but nothing more."}
{"text":"Pulled into drive through.  Waited 5 minutes to order once at the speaker and then waited 15 min in line after ordering.  This place has serious issues plus staff is not courteous non of them act like they care to be there.   Wont be back ever"}
{"text":"Fast service even when busy but ordered good and it was cold burgers and over cooked fries. Also the ketchup pumps were not working May need a little time management skills worked on here"}
{"text":"I'm giving this Wendy's 2 stars because I've never had any issues with them. Food has always been fresh (ironically lol), service has been pretty decent. However, I doubt I will return to this Wendy's location. I visited this Wendy's a few days ago and I didn't drink all of my tea. When I went to pour it out, a bug came out along with the rest of my drink. Need I say more? -- I won't be back."}
{"text":"I once walked into this Wendy's and walked out immediately bc it smelled like sewage.   I gave them a second chance and this time they forgot my fries and I didn't realize it until I got home. Plus my nuggets were cold af.   I paid for that.    Thanks Wendy's of Fitchburg."}
{"text":"I never review, but it's time. 3 times in a row, understaffed and so very slow. One time it was 6:30 so it was busy for dinner. Another time before it was nearly 3, still slow and got the order wrong. Tonight omg,  super slow, trash all over; all garbage cans overflowing. How on earth do they score a 98.5 on the health dept score. However, the food is actually very good so 4 stars if you are ok waiting and waiting and then having to go back and help them get the order right. Wear a mask and gloves or get in the drive thru along with the other dozen cars"}
{"text":"Stopped here for first time as we were sooooo hungry after golfing and didn't have much time.  Used drive-through, and found it super fast!! Had three cars ahead, so they were speedy!!  Fries were really hot, could be a little crisper, but no complaints. Got home and found order to be correct, still hot, and really pretty good!  Overall not a fan of fast food, but will keep this as an option over others in the area."}
{"text":"Nice clean place;  can get busy at lunch; today I noticed some serious attitudes amounst the crew here.  They seem very apathetic;  this may point to a management issue with this location."}
{"text":"I thought this location was nice, but unfortunately not the cleanest when it comes to food prep. I found a moth in my salad.  Their social media rep responded immediately, but the local management didn't respond until my SECOND email to corporate.  If you eat a salad from this location, make sure you inspect it thoroughly for extra protein not listed on the menu."}
{"text":"Good for fast food!!! Not as good if you like burgers like Mom use to cook but they are OK. Clean, fresh, and healthy burgers.+4.  Their rolls are better than McDonalds."}
{"text":"Meh. Gross location poor service, rotten drive-thru. Had to repeat our order like seven times. Food was fine I guess."}
{"text":"I'll be honest: until recently, the only thing I liked about Wendy's were their commercials and their Frosty.   But then one day I came to this location and the staff was friendly and efficient. The food was amazing. And most importantly, at the time, the service was fast (I used drive thru).   I came back a few days later, craving the same sandwich (the Asiago Chicken) and again, on a hurried lunch break. Once again, the service was lightening fast, the staff amazing, and the food perfect. This time it was a different pair of crew members, but they were friendly and thorough. I had a completed order, several napkins and my straw the MOMENT I pulled up to the window. Wow.   So today, I thought I'd try one more time (Mr. Asiago Chicken called to me again...). Again, I was not disappointed. I had a new set of crew members, one who was especially friendly and smiling and cracking a few jokes. She offered me a free small frosty because it was incorrectly dispensed and was going to be tossed anyway. I told the crew members how thankful I was that every time I come it's a magical experience, like Disneyland lol.  Thanks Wendy's on Charleston & Ft. Apache and keep up the great work!! No other fast food near my work, maybe anywhere in town, has offered a better quality of food and service in many years!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's has always had great service, I brought Grandma regularly, she loved the chili. I came in tonight for the first time in quite a while, my schedule changed, and wow!! They have upgraded everything, it looks amazing! I still see Cleveland, he's awesome!!! Top notch job Wendy's!! My food was great too."}
{"text":"S...U...P...E...R........ S...L...O...W... But if you aren't in a hurry, then they are clean inside and outside. The staff was friendly enough. I probably won't hurry back though, I was pressed for time. Maybe if I can sit for a good hour, then I will be back."}
{"text":"I ordered at the drive-thru the other day and after the first thing I ordered i heard a huge sigh on the intercom and then proceeded to continue ordering and the person kept on sighing, being super rude, and acting like I was inconveniencing with my order.  So when we get up to the window to pay I asked the young lady at the window to speak to the manager and as she was telling the manager I wanted to speak to her I asked her if that was the same person that took my order at the drive-thru she responded \"yes\". Then the manager appears in the window and I told her that I felt that she was being extremely rude and she said \"well I am sorry I don't feel good and I am trying to get someone to come and cover me so I can go home I don't want to be here.\" To which I responded that still doesn't make it right to be sighing and so rude to customers  at the drive thru and she just kept on being extremely rude and then walked away from the window. Then she proceeded to give the other young lady our drink order which was wrong and when  I told them she just said \" what they don't want the Dr. Pepper \" and I said \"I never ordered a Dr. Pepper \" then again from behind the window she kept on talking crap. I have never in my life been treated this way, I eat out pretty often and this has been the worst I have ever been treated it was pretty shocking and coming from a supposed Manager her name was MaryAnn. I have called the corporate number and have yet to hear from anyone. They have lost all of my business if this is the way the choose to serve the public. The young lady at the window named Julie did her best to try and rectify the situation she kept on apologizing which i appreciated but it was not her fault at all. I feel sorry that she has to work with someone like that and that this  is the way her management is showing other employees how to treat customers. If this is what Wendy's calls  Mangagement  Material I feel sorry for them it was very awful and hurtful for someone to be so blatantly rude,  Truly unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"No, I haven't gone off the deep end, but I am rating a fast food restaurant with 4 stars.  Why?  Because not only is the food typically slightly better than you would expect (this is not a 4-star restaurant, merely a Wendy's receiving 4 stars), the staff really friendly, and the dining room very clean (a feat, considering it is across the street from a high school), but they have free wireless internet access here, which I am using to Yelp this entry.  Kudos to you Wendy's for having wireless internet access in a town where that is not necessarily so easy to find!"}
{"text":"I pulled up to the drive thru window to pay at about 8:45pm and realized I didn't have my debit card and also 4 dollars short in cash. I asked the lady working the window if she could please change one of my 2 meals to just the sandwich and she so kindly did. I had just enough money to cover. She passed me my drink for the now solo meal, but then also passed me the second. I asked her if she was sure and she said yes of course don't worry about it. Then she passed me my bags and said the fries I previously ordered were in the bag as well and smiled!! It was the sweetest thing ever!! My faith in humanity is restored and I am so thankful for her kindness!!! I was so humbled and too busy saying thankyou a million times that I forgot to ask for her name, but she was working the window, ponytail, and wore the drive thru headset. Ma'am, you were so kind to me during an embarrassing moment, and when you could have saved your company 4 dollars worth of food by not giving me the fries and drink you chose to do what you felt was right and now you have a life long customer! Wendy's should be proud to have you on there team! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Waited in line here in Terminal A vto order Wendy's \"spicy chicken Caesar salad\" for $7.39.  No problem.  When order appeared after another 15 minutes, finally learned that there is no Caesar dressing.  Too much effort to remove from menu.  Suggest choosing a different place.  Buyer beware.  Honesty is still the best policy."}
{"text":"Wasn't happy with Wendy's level of cleanliness what so ever! Witnessed the cashier wiping down numerous TABLES with same dirty rag . Watched her wipe down all the SEATS too, with the same dirty rag. Watched her complete her cleaning routine at the garage area, wiping down the trays and using the same dirty rag to press down the over flowing garbage with THE SAME DIRTY RAG. Never once was this cleaning rag rinsed and nor was a sanitation solutions put on the tables that their customers eat off of. Disgusting to say the least.....germs, bacteria breeding"}
{"text":"I had an amazing service at this wendys. They were so fast and quick. I can't believe they gave me extras sour cream and butter for my bake potatoes. I mean they gave us 6 packets of spur cream and butter for only two potatoes.  I'm like hell yeah! Very clean environment. Wouldn't mind going there again"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service. Always got my order right!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's location is hit or miss. The associates seem rather friendly and I appreciate their patience and friendliness whenever I visit this location. I went today and ordered a #10 (10 chicken nuggets, fries, sweet tea). The fries I initially received were cold, my container was also only about 3/4 full. I asked the associate at the window if it could be filled and she did so with no problem. The fries that were added were hot. As I ate my food and took a sip of my sweet tea, I was pretty disappointed in the drink. It might as well have been plain water with a drop of tea just for color because that's what it tasted and looked like. Hopefully one day (soon), they'll get it right!  I want to give them 2.5 stars but it's not available, so I'll give 3 instead of 2 because the associates are always friendly to me. I really appreciate that, even though I go for the food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this location only has 1 star and the reviews are not good, but I'm glad I had a pleasant experience here. The drive thru line moved quickly and service was good. Had no issues with the associates or my food... my chicken nuggets were fresh and fries were hot. Can't get any better than that."}
{"text":"No major issues with my most recent visit here. It was about 830 or 9pm. I probably sat in the drive-thru for 10 minutes waiting to get up to the window, which I surprisingly wasn't phased by. My chicken nuggets and fries were fresh and hot, which I was very thankful for. Customer service is decent. I've been here multiple times and have never had any issues in that area.  One thing that did go wrong this visit was that I asked for no ice in my drink and they put ice in it. But that wasn't the end of the world."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the most friendly employees I have come in contact with in quite some time.... and this was 20 minutes before they closed the dining room.  Everything was fresh tasting and hot.  We were very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Love Wendy's, its my go to for fast food but the fries were so salty it made my lips break out... The girls in the drive thru were sweet though."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever. Employees are always rude, food takes forever. The need to fire the staff and start over fresh!!! Unbelievable how little the employees care about customers."}
{"text":"Super rude cashier and nasty!! Went to this location just to grab a quick sandwich. The bathroom is super dirty! And when I went to order a JBC the cashier went to the girl making the sandwiches to help her and was putting bacon on the sandwich with her bare hands!! Totally unsanitary! I even called her out on it. The other girl said she would make me another one but still didn't trust the two since she even allowed the girl to put bacon on the sandwich she was making clearly without gloves.  This place is super nasty, I ended up throwing the sandwich away! Don't waste your money here!!"}
{"text":"This takes the cake, or more like 2nd worst experience at a fast food place.  Stopped for a late night TOM run, if your a woman you'll know what I mean. If not, your SOL. Anyway, there was a line which didn't surprise me considering it was 20 minutes til closing,  Asked to order the chicken wrap, sorry all out of wraps. Okay, how about chicken sandwich? Sorry all out of that. Um, okay what do you have? Burgers, fries, nuggets. Ordered two bacon cheeseburger, waited and by the time I got home noticed they messed up and they were regular hamburgers with tomatoes and lettuce. First I'm allergic to tomatoes, second wtf.. No bacon?! Ugh   Was so upset I got back in my car and drove to Taco Bell. Hey, a girl has needs."}
{"text":"Fast service, whether you're inside or in the drive thru. Once I order, I usually have my food in less than 3 min. Food is always fresh and doesn't seem like it's been sitting, like other fast food places."}
{"text":"This Wendy's has always had me leave the drive through smiling. Accurate orders. No grief when asking for a mayo packet ( one reason I like Wendy's over McDonald's)  and an awesome value menu. Try the bacon mushroom melt. The chili cheese nachos are awesome when eaten quickly ( too Long makes them soggy) and one great thing about Wendy's is the option of a side ceaser instead of fries. Great for a tastey change."}
{"text":"I asked duke to substitute beef for spicy chicken and he straight up told me no, then can't. I'm buggin cause if I'm not mistaken, I can pay for the upgrade. It's completely unheard of to tell a paying customer no, and can't, when the request is 100% possible as well as profitable. Poor job. Order cancelled"}
{"text":"Terrible service, walked in and as soon as the cashier took the order previous to mine, left the station. Took 5 minutes to return, no apologies, no how may I help you, nothing! After taking my order I had to ask for a receipt when they are suppose to give you a receipt upon purchase. Employees of this location are not well trained at all. No freestanding fountain drink area, very inconvenient.Stay away from this place!!"}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here. It all started with the frightening woman glaring at us as we walked in. When we ordered I was not satisfied because it did not have a cheese burger! My friend ordered a Frosty and waited forever to get it and the same rude lady just glared at her as she furiously put the chicken nuggets down. Then my friend dropped her water as the cups were extra slippery, I swear the rude woman did it. Then we went to escape and the door handle was broke off and there was only one exit! Talk about a not safe environment. I was thankful when we finally left, DO NOT TAKE YOUR FAMILY, DOGS, BROTHERS, NUNS OR FROGS HERE OR IT WILL NOT BE GOOD!"}
{"text":"OK so by now most people know I am a pretty patience guy but every time I eat here it seems as if time slows down.The words fast food can not and should not be used when describing this place. First off let me start by saying that this place while a chain seems to be the broken link.   In the last three times I was forced to eat here (friends choice) I did not recive my complete order, was over charged, and received food that looked like it was left by a previous customer. Soggy fries, burgers coated in so much grease the bun would have slid off had it not been for all the cheese that held it to the wrapper! Of course this was after the long wait time (clocked at over 12 mins by my friend on one visit!) So why do people still eat here is my question? Maybe they are still stuck on the memories of cold and tasty frosty's.   Or maybe it was the times they enjoyed a biggie drink with free refills on a blazing 110 summer day here in phoenix. Who knows? I think that since they were acquired by Arby's there was no place for them to go but down hill. Dave Thomas would flip in his grave if he could see the tiny dried up squares of cow flesh his customers where offered for their hard earned dollar, and Wendy well she would be in tears!  R.I.P. to Wendy's and to another childhood memory."}
{"text":"This place definitely needs a remodel! Everything inside is like old fashion.   The food is okay. They have the 4 for $4 deal.   My favorite is the crispy chicken sandwich.   They do serve breakfast as well.   I think it's pretty pricey for the food quality you get."}
{"text":"There was no one in line before or after us and we only ordered one thing, yet the lady still managed to be a bit rude and dump our fries upside down in the drive thru bag. How hard would it have been to not mess up? Just yucky."}
{"text":"PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE. stupid dude cant count. stupid manager can't accomodate.  I swear this place is owned and operated by retardes with scalding cases of derpes."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in around 5:00 pm on Christmas Eve to enjoy our traditional light dinner after the Christmas Eve service.  We confirmed via phone earlier this week that the dining room would be open until 8:00 pm as usual.  However when we arrived tonight the doors were locked as we were walking up, with zero explanation."}
{"text":"Not GF friendly... I was kinda peeved that when I asked for my baconator with no bun and extra lettuce to make that my bun instead they looked at me like I grew a second head. All my food was cold and when asked to remake it they rolled their eyes. Not going back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"I ordered chili through the drive-thru and it was a cup of orange water.  It was the worse chili.  I enjoy Wendy's food, but lately it has been really bad. When you get chicken wraps with very little chicken and hamburgers that are cold. Do I have to park my car and go inside to get decent food?"}
{"text":"Literally just went through the drive through.these people want all this money to work a fast food joint but can't even count to 6 nor can they  put a sauce in a bag. I ordered a 6 piece chicken nugget...only got 5 and asked for a sweet and sour sauce and got NONE!....but they want more money..bring in the machines."}
{"text":"Like the others... there's NO WAY I ever thought I've give a Wendy's anything higher than 3 stars. I just got through security and haven't eaten all day so I stop in to a very clean, well organized and moderately busy counter top to order some grub. The young lady who took my order was sweet, polite and efficient. I ordered the combo #1 and she asked what size. Medium please...  We had a brief conversation about travelers and the sheer volume of customers they see every day. I departed as the next customer stepped up to order. She asked for my name to put on the order instead of a number! Wow. Different.   I waited for my meal; my name was called in five mintes. Another young lady gave me my food with a pleasant smile and two ranch cups for my fries - Texans know what I'm talking about!  When I sat down near my gate I opened the bag an found a neatly wrapped item next to fresh fries. Tucked in there also was a few napkins. I've never seen a fast food restaurant accomplish presenting food in such an appealing way! I took out my burger and unwrapped it in awe. IT ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE THE COMMERCIALS.  Dead serious. And every bite tasted like a burger made fresh from fresh incredients. Pickles were crispy and the lettuce didn't look like it was water logged and old. Fries... get me started. Perfect. Not soggy and actually taste like they cut a real potatoe and fried it up... unlike competitors.  Why did I take the time to write this? Because well done Wendy's. Well done accomplishing 1) fantastic meal 2) pleasant, clean, well dressed employees 3) earning yourself a call to your corporate offices to pay a complement.   Your management team and you yourself should be proud. This is exactly how it's supposed to be!"}
{"text":"I'm always treated well when I visit this Wendy's. The staff are friendly and concerned with the cleanliness of their restaurant. In fact, I haven't been to many, if any, other quick-service restaurants that have staff members who check on the status of the dine-in customers as much as the staff here does.  Now to the food... It's Wendy's. You know it and you love it. Who doesn't? But, Wendy's has really kicked it up a notch with the addition of their salad selections. If I could give them 6 STARS ****** for this, well, I would and I guess I just did!  I LOVE the Power Mediterranean Salad! The Strawberry Mango Salad is also AWESOME. Even though I, personally, do not care for feta cheese too much, I know there are some who love it. Regardless, the Strawberry Mango Chicken Salad is so good, IMHO, that it's worth picking around the feta. There are several other great salad choices available as well. (....In case you haven't noticed, I love salad! But, shhh! don't tell anyone! It'll just be our little secret!  ;)  Standard Wendy's fare is still here and still available, including the Asiago Chicken Sandwich, which is my favorite chicken sandwich here. ;). So, whether you're into Dave's famous burgers, tasty chicken sandwiches, healthy salad options, chocolate frosties, or their signature French fries, then this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Went to drive-thru around midnight.  Had the Asiago club chicken sandwich combo.  The sandwich was fresh and presented well, the fries were way overdone, dark brown and almost crunchy, yet lukewarm.  They failed to give me a receipt but were courteous."}
{"text":"Burgers are subpar at best tasting mostly like filler. The poutine was okay...at last they use real curd. The service was lackluster with them needing to ask 4 times for someone to make a coffee."}
{"text":"The service was really friendly and quite quick. The place was clean...including the washroom which is always a plus. We ordered Frostees and they were outstanding. A pretty darn good visit."}
{"text":"Chances are if you're eating here you're not looking for 5 star cuisine. You're hungry, lazy, and just want to get your food quickly and get out. If that's you, this place is what you're looking for."}
{"text":"The TV commercials make it look really good, but when pulling into the drive-thru here at 4:30pm, I ordered the taco salad and was told, '...we don't have any of the tortilla chips for the salad...is that ok?'   No, that is NOT okay...! Coming here specifically for the taco salad, not having the tortilla chips is unacceptable! Are you gonna dump the chili into a salad bowl and add salsa? No, that is NOT okay.   The restaurants should have inventory on hand, especially when introducing a new menu item, ... it's sad that your inventory can only get thru the lunch rush... it's 'dinner time' and the menu items are unavailable.. had I known this, I certainly would not have visited.   This location continues to fall short of customer satisfaction.... smh"}
{"text":"Horrible Wendy's.   I usually come around 1ish when it shouldn't be too busy, and no matter what they never have enough workers. Typically spend 5 minutes waiting, and then another 5-10 minutes after ordering--I thought this was fast food?  They ask \"for here or to go\" and then proceed to ignore you. Asked for here, gave me a to go bag.. I reiterated it was for here and she puts the bag on a tray lmao. Why waste the bag? smh."}
{"text":"I usually use the drive thru. Service is fast and I usually get all hat I ordered. A couple of times they did not give me a straw for my beverage. It's difficult going 40-45 mph on independence without a straw for the drink.  When I eat inside it's a clean room and the napkins, ketchup, others are kept full.   Love the specials and usually get burgers . Wendy's chili is my favorite.  The drive thru workers could act a bit friendlier versus just asking for your money and handing over the bag of food."}
{"text":"Worse drive through service. Almost 10minute wait. Talk about slugs. No since of urgency.  Luck me I am not on anybody's schedule right now."}
{"text":"I visited this Wendy's on Mar 29, 2017 at about 10p. I ordered my food and as i was told to pull around to pay for my order, I was sitting in drive thru while my food was already bagged and sitting in the window the cashier (Jessica) continue taking orders and making drinks and i asked this young lady who was pregnant  can i please pay for my food and that it was sitting there getting cold and Jessica stated to me, that is the way they take orders and as she continued going back and forth with me, i asked for a manager and she SLAM the window in my face and as she walked away i could hear Jessica screaming for the \"manager to come up front and talk to this lady.\"   That was a horrible experience for me, and when the manager \"Devin\" came to speak with me, at the drive thru window, he also stated to me that the cashiers are to take as many orders as possible before giving the customer their food, and Devin stated that is the way they've always did it, and at that point i was exhausted with both of them they where very UNPROFESSIONAL.....I will NEVER go to this location again and i will be sure to tell all my soical media family/friends....Thanks for nothing.."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  Picked up the new chicken mozzarella salad - guess what?  NO CHICKEN.  I contacted Wendy's Customer Care and was told a District Manager would get in touch with me.  It's been nearly a week - that hasn't happened.  Is this how they treat their customers?  I basically paid $7 for a bowl of lettuce.  The tomatoes were MUSHY - as they ran out of grape tomatoes and substituted mushy tomato slices - two pieces of cheese on the salad and no chicken.  Several staff were standing around in the kitchen doing nothing - apparently nobody at Wendy's gives a crap.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's, a regular lunch stop in my work schedule. Quick and cheap, usually pretty bang on with my order, not too often do I leave feeling unsatisfied."}
{"text":"No receipt given to complete Wendys Corp. survey.  This location plans that so Corp. can't follow-up.  Breakfast Sand. and side was COLD. No ice in the Ice tea so that was warm... Staff had no idea what and how to use the Wendys app. this is all just SAD and these folks want $15 a hour? for what they can not do anything now, so lets pay them more for nothing yes that seems right."}
{"text":"I got stale buns here once. Like, not even edible. I've never received good food here off the 99cent value menu. The people seem friendly, but the service is slow. Pony up a few more bucks and go to Chipotle across the street"}
{"text":"I have gone there 3 times in the past month. The food has been awful. Fries soggy and cold and the sandwiches seem like they have been sitting out for awhile. At first I thought it was just my timing. Going back at a different time with different crew didn't help. I will not be going back to this location. Customer service is not so great either. Hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"Food was good and restrooms are very clean. They were very slow with working through the line during lunch rush. This location is attached to a Tim Hortons so it gets even more busy and crowded during lunch. I don't know the area very well, but gauging the lunch crowd and how people put up with such slow service makes me think maybe there aren't there other restaurants around the area, or maybe it's something only the friendly Canadians can put up with."}
{"text":"Give me my baked potato!!!  Yep, I come for the baked potato and I'm not ashamed. Let me be honest, I cannot cook baked potatoes. They come out hard, undercooked and nasty. The baked potatoes at Wendy's are heaven. Smothered with cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, and chives. Deliciousness! They are huge too so no skimpy ones. Just how I like them.   Next, their home style chicken sandwiches are cooked to perfection. Never over done, perfect crispy ness, and never greasy. The chicken breast is large and hits the spot.   The french fries are hit and miss. Sometimes soggy or over done. you never know what your getting.   Now, let's get to the sweet stuff. The frosty is an original hit here. Back when I was little I would dunk my fries but now it just tasted weird. It's sweet but not exactly like ice cream.. More like frozen yogurt. I say get a small and try it. Usually what I do is at the beginning of the year buy a one dollar key chain and get a mini frosty with every purchase that year. Sweet treat at every visit. Even if you go once every 3 months it's only 25 cent a frost. It pays for itself.   The coupons to your email and mail are awesome. I always get BOGO sandwich or salad coupons. Saves you a little bit."}
{"text":"Worse Wendy's ever. Zero bun coverage. Doesn't know what that even means!!! Will not ever come back!!!"}
{"text":"These guys are great my broke ass went in there thinking I had money and I didn't and they gave me a Baconator and fries for free thanks a lot guys!"}
{"text":"Place was so clean and organized! They also have a nice electric fireplace and TV for patrons to enjoy! Recieved alot of food and the new \"Dave's Soda\" partnership with Coca Cola are awesome! I had the Cherry Creme flavor."}
{"text":"Wendy's has always been a favorite fast food establishment of mine. I love the burgers and they have the best fries in the industry.  But this review is for their breakfast, something relatively new for Wendy's. I've had their new Frescuit breakfast sandwich and I'm a fan.  But at this location I found something new, a grilled panini style breakfast sandwich with eggs, sausage and cheese.   What I really liked was being able to choose a side. I love their cottage fries, but when I saw one option was a yogurt cup, I went for that.   When I got to the plane and could finally eat, I was so impressed. The sandwich was real tasty and the cheese was so gooey. I saved the yogurt for later and that was really good as well. And it was a really good value, under $4.   I'm not sure how bad for you the breakfast sandwich was, and it's prolly good that I don't have easy access to Wendy's, because I'd be eating this all the time!"}
{"text":"So glad to see all of these one star reviews. Well deserved! The staff is generally not friendly and the food is terrible. This seems to be a common theme among many Wendy's these days. Dave Thomas would be disgusted if he knew what's become of his business."}
{"text":"This is a hard one to review because my son and i were here two days in a row with very different results.  The first day, we were getting a large order to go for us and the extended family, and the girl on the cash register made sure she got it right, and even though there is a display screen in front of her register, she read the order back to us, and even kept an eye on the person putting together our order, and when she noticed something was misunderstood by her coworker, she helped correct this, and the manager, was right in the middle leading the troops.  So on January 2-2015 they were an impressive unit that got a rather large order put together correctly and kept the customer happy.  Now  skip over to January 3-2015.  My son and i just wanted a burger and a baked potato each and this proved to be somewhat problamatic for the Saturday crew, and it took a long time too, the service was awkward and slow and the person who appeared to be the manager just stood back and watched his crew shuffle though it.  So for the first crew, they would get five stars on Yelp and one more from me for a great performance and a motivational manager.  For the second crew, that was a two star performance and the food was correct after a little prodding from the customer and as for the manager that day, take your hands out of your pockets when see the line backing up due to problems expediting the orders and get in the game.  So for day two the food saved them on this rating.  I will give them a 4 over all and express my appreciation to the first crew and suggest the weekenders look to the others for guidance.  We are still fans of Wendys but the service was like night and day.  Anyhow, its all about the food, and seriously i got a bit of a chuckle watching these people bumbling around while the knucklehead manager seemed oblivious to why he is there.  I can only hope someone higher up reads this and pats the one crew on the back for stellar service,  and kicks the second crew in the butt for poor service.  And yes i will be back, if i have to eat fast food, i prefer Wendys over most other options.  Just want to add one more thing.  They recently renovated this restaurant and they did a pretty good job, i like the new design."}
{"text":"I can't complain about my experience at this Wendy's.  I stopped in for lunch and decided to get a couple of items off of their value menu. Nuggets and jr. bacon cheeseburgers to be exact. Both were fresh and hot. I have no complaints about the food or the location in general.   I would say that the inside of the place seemed abandoned. The employees working there also didn't seem particularly interested in working either, not that I'm judging. Perhaps it was a slow day maybe? I don't know.   What I do know is this Wendy's looks nice, is in a good location, and has decent food. As far as service is concerned? I found it to be average.   It could have been a lot worse, so I'm fine with my experience there."}
{"text":"I was listening to the radio and I heard a commercial. It was for the Wendys baconator! I couldnt believe my ears, was this a comedy skit or was this a real ad?  It was real unfortunatly. It has 6 pieces of bacon two beef patties and two pieces of cheese.  http://www.wendys.com/... check out that bad boy.   Thats soo sick  Im inspired to go start a topic now"}
{"text":"I went and got a couple value meals. Was a bit upset, but I spoke with David the area manager, and he right away was not only willing to replace my meal, but listened and was concerned. He also followed up with me. Because you do not find the concern he displayed, not only will I go back, I'll go again and again. Thanks to David and Wendy's!"}
{"text":"2pm on a monday...   If not outside smoking, these high schoolers have no interest in customer service, rather they are strutting about apparently trying to impress each other while customers are made to wait to place their orders.   I ordered a sandwich, chili and fries, the sandwich was up first but wasn't joined by the fries until 3 minutes later. I had to ask for the chili as it was omitted.   Took 19 minutes to get my order.   Tattooed arms and diamond pierced earrings (on the boys) while the manager stood on the counter picking her nose... and waiting for a simple order that took entirely too long makes this place a most disgusting one to avoid.   Unbelievable...and these are the people wanting $15 an hour?"}
{"text":"The people there are the rudest people ever I went to the drive thee around 11:30 p.m and they guy on the box said \"welcome to Wendy's (pause) what do you want?\"   I replied I have three separate order is that okay he goes   \"No one order per car\"  I asked him when was that a new rule? And he told me   \"What do you dude\"    I said FUCK YOH YOUR SERVICE IS SHIT ANS DROVE AWAY   I WILL NEVER GO TO THAT PLACE AGAIN"}
{"text":"They do a good job with the food, and i came here with 2 other people [1 week before writing this review] but 3 stars because they accidentally mixed up an order. good for a stopping place.   Recommendation: 79.3%"}
{"text":"Broken Menu, terrible customer service, girl at the window probably thinks she will die if she smiles. Something is horridly wrong with this place and its like they rush you when you're ordering and when you ask for condiments they practically throw them at you just to get you out of there (no there was no line of cars waiting behind us, not even one). French fries are soggy (not fresh) and burgers are not freshly made to order either. Ill just make the extra drive to 75th ave location at Desert Sky Mall."}
{"text":"I keep trying this store.  And the service here is uniformly awful. No one seems to be working there. It's just a big joke to the crew.  Tried again yesterday and the vanilla frosty machine had a problem.  The staff addressed this be screaming \"DID YOU FIX THE FROSTY MACHINE \" over and over again to no one in particular. Honestly, I'm not even sure I got the right sandwich (Baconator vs. Jr. Baconator). I do know for absolute sure that hte sandwich was hours old. I'm done with that store."}
{"text":"Pretty interior, spiffy soda fountain,  Worst. Service. Ever.    I've had multiple problems with the crew in this store since they re-opened, but yesterday evening took the cake.  I went in to pick up some last minute food for the family and was immediately suspicious when I saw half a dozen people milling about unhappily at the food pickup location, an no one giving them food.  When I questioned the cashier about the delay, another customer actually came back and demanded a refund because she couldn't wait any longer.  When I noticed that half of the crew seemed to be sitting in the dining room watching TV.      I've been to this store frequently and there is definitely a pattern or very very poor and incompetent service. Almost every order I've placed had something forgotten or incorrect. There are always crewmembers milling around doing nothing, playing with the TV or in case, rapping behind the counter.   I've just had it with this store, I plan on avoiding it until the get some people actually interested in serving their customers, and I would strongly advise others to do the same.  At this point I wouldn't even trust the food that comes out of their kitchen.  UPDATE:   I was able to reach a regional manager via email, and he replied briefly that it was a situation that was being addressed.  In the last month, I have been there 2 or 3 times with simple take-out orders and everything seemed to go fine. Got what I ordered in a reasonable amount of time and everyone on the crew were if not working, not blatantly goofing off. So added a Star to the rating, even though I'm still kind of leary."}
{"text":"the drive thru line is always too long and moves too slowly. sometimes cars are stuck on Baum blvd. also, the service is slow and poor."}
{"text":"The Guinness book of world records needs to visit this location to verify my suspicion that this is perhaps the slowest drive through experience you will ever receive, regardless of when you come, or what you order... It will be very slow... You will sit in the parking lot and watch in amazement as three or four employees sit at tables in the (closed) dining room area and text people. Perhaps they are excited about the nomination they will receive for slowest possible service... Or maybe they are texting the one person in the back and letting them know that they need to get the line moving because traffic has extended onto the street... Make sure you are in the right lane after you pass through the intersection because it is highly likely you will begin your long journey to the order window on the actual street in front of this Wendy's, one star because the order was semi-accurate."}
{"text":"I have been to this Wendy's three times in the last few months and only now am I compelled to talk about how slow it is, I see a total of two tables inside and there were three cars outside.  I waited in the drive-through for two cheeseburgers for over 25 minutes... All three times I've been here I get The excuse was \"we are changing the registers\"... The lettuce on my burger extended the overall length of the burger by about 4 inches on every side; you could fold it around the burger... Not the best Wendy's out there."}
{"text":"Pulled up to drive thru and waited to be greeted after asking for assistance several times.  The employee was rude and acted annoyed that we wanted to be waited on.  She then proceeded to gossip about us to the car in front of us and we could hear everything!  Unprofessional and some of the worst customer service I have received in along time.  Her excuse was that they were short staffed, she also claimed to be the manager!  Those are NOT excuses for terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Constantly busy and for fast food they 90% of the time get the order correct.  They can't help how busy it is which makes wait times a little longer than people would like.  Champaign non-campus needs another location!  Overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"They added mayo to my husband's sandwich even though I asked twice for it to come with NO MAYO. They added it anyways and he couldn't eat it as a result (allergy). I called the location and spoke with Sara who responded by saying she couldn't check that each sandwich was made correctly.  This location and the manager are a total joke. Sara, your customer service skills suck."}
{"text":"It took over 15 minutes to get my food we only ordered 2 meals they employees are in the back playing around chasing each other there is no sence of urgency in getting the food out and there were other people complaing about there food to and why is there a homeless man just hanging out in the lobby very poor service take pride in your job"}
{"text":"I came here to get the new Preztel Bun Cheeseburger. It was decent, although I probably won't be back for another."}
{"text":"Since they remodeled it just is not the same. I have lunch here just about every Sunday. The place used to be the best now it is just like al the rest. I think while they were closed they lost there staff.the new dinning room has some new convenience such as charging stations. But l personally am not comfortable in the dinningrroom. I don't think I'll be going back here for Sunday lunch anymore"}
{"text":"Not very good.  Food not very fresh.  Staff not very friendly.  I would not recommend this place, sorry."}
{"text":"Got wrong thing three different times, called the last time and the manager put me on the log. When we went, the manager working wouldn't honor it and was confrontational. Not going back."}
{"text":"Ok, I never post on fast food restaurants only because I mean come on.. how big of expectations can I set right ? Well this Wendy's in particular is the worst I have ever been to, I get the manager of a fast food place can't be that happy about their jobs but the somewhat older lady is absolutely terrible. We argued about a meal and being able to substitute a piece of a meal for the other. After trying to explain to her what I was trying to do because she obviously doesn't understand anything, the answer was no. Seems silly to not want to give me a cheaper product over the more expensive one I didn't want but whatever. The cashier couldn't figure out how to change from a kids drink to a normal one (all Wendys do that) and on top of that couldn't figure out how to give us the sauces we wanted and told us it wasn't possible.. weird how we asked the other person and they handed it right to us. Woman manager here is the rudest I've ever met, I get it. You're a fast food joint manager I can see why you're angry, but don't be unreasonable and just straight rude. Never going to this Wendy's again."}
{"text":"Dave Thomas is a great guy! Wendy,his daughter does a great job maintaining this franchise nation wide. Quality burgers at an affordable price!"}
{"text":"Very nice and clean place. They have a tv inside as well. They have a soda machine with so many options.   The employees are nice and friendly.   My favorite is the homestyle chicken sandwich & the asiago ranch chicken club. The only difference is the asiago has ranch, cheese, & bacon on it.   They have a good deal 4 for $4 comes with fries, 4 chicken nuggets, a drink & you get to choice anything else like a sandwich."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's in Charlotte! I've been 4 times now and the drive-through is the slowest drive-through I've ever experience. I have learned my lesson now and would never go back there. 3 out of 4 visits my order was wrong and the last time it was a twenty minute wait plus when I got home the order was wrong. Do not give this location your money."}
{"text":"The drive in was wrapped around the parking lot.  we went in to order a hamburger patty and a frosty.  After a 15 minute wait, we asked for our  $$ back.   The last four experiences have been horrendous -- missing items, 20 minute wait, errors with orders etc The manager's only response has been \"computer issues.\" If you insist on ordering to go, check your order immediately.  Open the hamburger too  We will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Indifference, long long wait, observed mistakes on at least every other order that required additional time (we skipped fixing ours). I will always change the scale for airport food so the 1 star is like a -3 in the outside world. Gives PHX a bad rep."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times since moving to Buckeye and have been unimpressed each time.  This last time was the last time I will go here.  About 2 weeks ago my wife and I went inside to place an order for our entire family.   What a disaster.  The menu board and the signage in the lobby were showing different prices for frosty's and when we pointed that out the cashier, who I believe was the manager, said \"Yeah we need to get new numbers for out there\"  This was a .30 cent difference on 4 frosty's.  The staff was extremely slow in their attitude and urgency to take care of the customers.  Finally all of our food was made and we took our bags and drove home.  Every single sandwich was made wrong.  5 Cheeseburgers with no cheese or ketchup on them.  I double cheese made the same way.  2 fish sandwiches plain just fish and bun.....these were made with everything on them.  When I called to let them know....whomever answered the phone told me to call corporate and hung up.  Really?   It has been 2 weeks and corporate is blowing off all of my calls and has not responded to a single e-mail.  Wendy's as a corporation has officially lost my business as well.     I have eaten at Wendy's locations that were decent.  This one is a major beware.  Heed the rest of the reviews and stay away.  Trust us."}
{"text":"Doesn't deserve any stars. The lack of respect from management is pitiful. Found hair in my food and the so called manger was disrespectful because I brought half the food back for half my money, I went in respectful , walked out disrespected. They don't follow their health code what so ever. That was my last time I'll ever go there."}
{"text":"Pretty simple review here... walked in and only 1 person in front of me in line and my order took 26 minutes to get... fast food?"}
{"text":"Have turned three orders into complete abortions. Contacted corporate which got the store manager/operator in touch with me, but that was as bad as the service due to the person not having the ability to form basic sentences nor properly spell much of what he was trying to say in the email. If this is any indication of what Wendy's believes to be quality, I fear for the shareholders.   Seriously, how can you screw up three separate orders made over the course of 60 days by one person. This has to be some record or perhaps I'm on a gag show that captures folks on film being blown away by inept service."}
{"text":"Slowest. Wendys. Ever. I literally waited in line for over thirty minutes on a Thursday night once, only to have them forget my frosty. I haven't seen the inside but my drive thru experiences have not been good ones."}
{"text":"Worst order taker (Pam), nasty, argued with me, no patience.  Slow not aware of long line of people. Not the person that should be in that position at lunch time. If she remains in that position we cannot afford the  time to eat lunch there."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Waited inline to order and it took them 15 minutes to take 2 different peoples order. This was at 3pm in the afternoon so not a peak meal time either. People were leaving realizing that if they did get to order it would take forever to get their food.  Severely under staffed. I can't say how the food was because I left before I could order. Never coming back to this Wendy's again.  they should be ashamed. Dave Thomas is rolling over in his grave in disgust."}
{"text":"If you've been living under a rock, or couldn't tell from the exterior, this location was relatively recently renovated. Complete with flat screen TVs broadcasting (at least during my latest visit) the Olympics, a faux fireplace, modern decor, spacious booths, and one of those new custom touch screen Coke machines, it's a nice enough place to sit and enjoy a square patty burger.  The staff is friendly and efficient, and seem to do a good job keeping it pretty clean even during heavy hours."}
{"text":"After landing in PHX but before embarking on a 2.5 hour drive to Flagstaff, i thought Wendy's would be a safe and easy place to grab some food on the go...well, I was wrong.  * Chicken Nuggets: dry, freezer-burned meat with extra hard double-fried shell.  * French Fries: super hot, crunchy, over-fried french-fry-shaped fry-shells. so hard and crunchy that i thought i was eating french-fry chips.  * Junior Bacon Cheese Burger: bacon and burger meat both tasted dehydrated.  Guess what, last thing I want after a 4hr flight and landing in 100+ weather is hot, dry, crunchy, tasteless food!"}
{"text":"This is NOT just another Wendy's.  That's right this place is NOT just your typical Wendy's restaurant that you're used to.  Why do you ask?  Come and visit this upscale version of an everyday fast food chain and you'll see for yourself.    The layout of this restaurant is much different from any Wendy's I've been.  The ordering counter is at the side of the restaurant and the pick up as at the back sort of around the corner if you will.  The layout, dining area, and footprint is not your typical Wendy's indeed.  Upon entry you will see the \"Wendy's Etobicoke\" Welcome wall.  You really cannot miss it considering it is the wall you will see upon entering the western doors.  The furniture is different.  Cusion type benches in the booths, couch type seating with a table near the faux fireplace and mounted flat screen television.  A Coke Freestyle machine adorns the corner to allow you to refill with the kinds of Coke products not typically seen in bottles or cans.  Cherry Coke?  Vanilla Coke?  Caffeine free Diet Coke?  All the others you may or may not want just there for the trying.  Sprites, Barqs,  all the Coke products yes.  It's like your own little World of Coke from Atlanta in a vertical touch screen interface just like you would expect in the future except it's all happening now.   The food is pretty much the same as any Wendy's but this place just feels special.  It's a trick, but it's not.  Nice staff, clean, well kept.  This restaurant has been here for several years and is the nicest Wendy's I know of... AND it happens to be in Etobicoke.   Welcome to Wendy's Etobicoke."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is so run down compared to say the Wendy's on Queensway just east of the East Mall.  That Wendy's has a fireplace, tv's, universal Coke machine and is always clean etc.    This one on Dundas near Kipling is usually messy and the tables don't get cleared as fast.  It's usually pretty busy too since it shared a building with Tim Horton's as well but patrons can sit on any side of the building they want.  There are 2 drive throughs as well.  Tim's entrance is near the front of the building facing Dundas while Wendy's drive through entrance is at the back of the building.  The parking lot here is usually pretty full even though it's completely surrounded by parking.   This intersection is pretty busy too (Aukland and Dundas) because it's where all the East Mall, West Mall, Shorncliff etc buses turn as well as one of the ways out for cars that go to the kiss and ride meeting hub for Kipling.    The only saving grace of this place is that closes late (2am?).  The last time I was there they didn't even have chili.  A person in front of me was not impressed and just left and went over to Tim's."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick pick up for dinner on my way home from work one evening.   The first thing I noticed was that the entire parking lot was empty. At first, this place looked like it was possibly closed already. Despite this, I pulled around to the drive thru to see that there was indeed a car there waiting to give their order.   After what seemed like 5 minutes (give or take), the car in front of me did finally give their order to the speaker and pulled up. I then pulled up and gave my order to the speaker as well. The employee on the other side didn't seem particularly happy to be taking my order.   Anyway, after pulling up and getting ready to pay, the person at the drive thru hands me a bag and gets a bit of attitude when I ask if the straw is inside the bag. After I pay, the person said nothing to me and walked away after handing me my card back.   Listen folks, I truly in my heart understand why some people in the service industry who are not making more than 8 bucks an hour would hate their job, I do. But seriously, at least try not to be lousy to the customers who are just there to pick up food.   I couldn't help but wonder if it is the job itself that this person despised, or the management that they work with on a daily basis. Either way, the lousy service I received reflected poorly on this Wendy's as a whole.   Tough for me to justify a second trip back to this location."}
{"text":"A decent Wendy's location. Good food, average service.   So this Wendy's tends to get my business when I am out and about in North Phoenix, usually after I stop at The Home Depot that is in the same plaza. I find that the inside of the restaurant is usually clean, the drive thru moves pretty quickly, and the food orders have never been wrong.   Sadly, the friendliness of the staff is lacking sometimes. Twice I've placed orders and had the staff member take my card without looking at me or acknowledging me. Just snatching my card and giving it back without a even a \"thank you\" or anything. Not sure what that's about.   Anyway, as far as the food goes, I really can't complain. I've never had a problem in that area and it always is hot and fresh. The location of this Wendy's is good enough, sitting in a plaza off of T-Bird that is easily accessible. In the end, I may stop back in at some point, but I'm not clambering to do it.   The nuggets have my loyalty more than anything else."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst fast food place I have to go too. 1st visit I was really craving for a frosty. Went thru the drive thru.. Ordered and she gave me the frosty. And that's it. No spoon or straw. I'm now annoyed. Asked her if I can have a spoon or straw. With my annoyed face and voice.. Her response., \"oh you want a spoon or straw\"?? Mind you, you should see the attitude and the neck rolling when she said that.. So I said.. Duhhh, common sense isn't it. I feel I'm about to jump out of my car and she about to climb out of that drive thru so it best I drive off. Livid at this point...  I saw the commercial 2 days ago for the steak salad, I really wanted to try it.. So since my man is heading to Culver's. Why not stop by Wendy's for the salad.. Well, this is great. I got the salad with no steaks.. Was I surprised.. Not at all. He called to tell them about it and asked if I wanted him to go back for \"the steaks\". I said don't bother and I guess I'll be Yelping about this.  Honestly I really don't think anybody here cares about their job that much.. It's a prime location.. Next to Carowinds. And location on one of the busiest streets. Take it or leave. Well 2nd strike and I'll say I'll leave it. Many more places who will want my money, and they will gladly give me my orders w/o attitudes and get it right the 1st time."}
{"text":"It's Wedny's.  Give me some fries and a Dr. Pepper and I'm good to go."}
{"text":"When I am craving junk I usually come here for their value menu.  You can usually get a decent amount of food for less than $10.  I usually always order the JBC, nuggets, chilli, and baked potato.  The JBC (Junior Bacon Cheeseburger) always makes me feel good while I am eating it.  For $1.89 you cannot go wrong.  This location is pretty nice after they renovated it. It is usually always clean. They have the coke machine that gives you options for over 20 flavors, a fireplace, tv, and free wifi.  What more can you really ask for from a fast food chain?"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is particularly terrible, as in how is it still open for business. Nobody seems to care at all about what they are doing. The manager took my order, over charged me AND got the food order wrong. Cheshire Cat tattoo eyes on the arm so she's identifiable.  The rim of both the cups I got were sticky and covered in dust and dirt. I actually had to ask 3 times for cups. First the same manager ignored me after shoving the bag of food across the corner to which I asked \"May I have the cups?\" So she handed one medium cup and moved away without even looking at me, next I had o ask an entirely different worker for the two large cups that I had ordered.  Not to mention the place is just dirty."}
{"text":"I went to this location expecting just some average service but Tracy blew me away with his service. He was amazing!! I would have just thought of it as just another store but I know for a fact, as long as his service is there, I will return. I ordered a large order and he helped accustom me with everything that paired with the items I ordered. I will return with my big orders. He's awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Yuck...I was served an uncooked chicken sandwich today.  When I took it back, I was met with indifference...no refund either which was shocking!  I posted a photo that shows the evidence - beware!"}
{"text":"No variety of drinks out of everything food is nasty bread taste like it's been there for days. I definitely do not recommend this Wendy's."}
{"text":"I came to Wendy's to dine-in 30 minutes before they were supposed to lock up the restaurant, which is a lot of time for fast food. They made it obvious that they were unhappy I was there by loudly stating \"ugh, someone came in, take their order.\" While I was giving my order at the counter, a friend of the cashier walked in and the cashier yelled \"hey\" right into my ear. They then proceeded to have a conversation in the middle of my order. On top of all this they did not get my order right. I tried to be nice when I left by saying have a good night but instead they all just ignored me. I did not even get a single head nod or slight smile. I am very unhappy I went there."}
{"text":"Only left one star because you can't leave none. Slow, rude and wrong is what you can expect for your order.  Your business is viewed as an interruption to their socializing on their phones and with each other.  I've watched at the pick up window while they hang together and talk while you wait for your food. Don't know how they turn a profit other than the luck of the location and the versatile Wendy's menu."}
{"text":"This black guy Akon skin tone hates working at this Wendy's! He has no personality, looks depressed, and all the sadness in the world? FYI has name is Jax. This place say hiring. I guess this dude rather make zero money than work at all. I know this is a fast food place. Come on bro... you have a job making some kind of money legally! This person makes this Wendy's tainted?"}
{"text":"Tried the 4 for $4. It appears to be leftovers. Cold soggy fries, Cold dried out hamburger patty, Cold chicken sandwich, cup filled to the top with ice, and no ranch for the nuggets.  It's stoner food.  What happened to Wendy's? Hamburgers there used to be hot and juicy. Now they are cold and dry.  This particular store seems to always suck. It's so mediocre that I rarely go to Wendy's anymore anywhere, and I used to go all the time.  Maybe it's because it's technically on the rez  and anchored by a walmart."}
{"text":"First time at this Wendy's.   Tried the Bacon N Bleu for the first time too. The burger, with a thick patty, bleu crumbles and spread, fresh tomato, bright greens, pretzel bun and lots of bacon, sounded good.   When I opened the 'box' I found tomatoes and greens all over the inside, the patty and bacon halfway off the bun and the bleu spread everywhere. It appears the cook was going thru the motions and literally tossed everything in.   Not sure if this was normal but I won't be ordering at that restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative I would. I ordered a chicken sandwich off of the $ menu as I went through the drive through along with ordering a couple of other items and was charged a $5 chicken sandwich. I called and of course they want me to come back when I'm already across town. No!  Credit my card!  They'll call me back!  Sure they will!!  Then when I called them back they were to credit my card but of course never did. I sure wish the $5 sandwich was worth it!!  I can guarantee I'll never step foot into this or probably into another Wendy's again!"}
{"text":"Order ALWAYS wrong. Must stay at window to check. Food is good once correct, but is it a chain. Only reason I gave 2 stars."}
{"text":"Just want to check in and give Avery some praise. It is nice to be helped by someone with such an upbeat attitude. Is always very friendly and smiles. Feel like he really loves his job. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I am NOT impressed!   I ordered a chicken sandwich plain and chicken nuggets for my child!   I asked for Siarotcha sauce, they did not give it to me, and when I asked them for it they gave me 1 packet.  I said I would need 2 more, and was told I had to pay 30 cents a packet!!!   I told them I had never been asked to pay for a packet of sauce EVER!!   I was told \"WELL WE DO THINGS DIFFERENT AT CAROWINDS WENDYS\". really???   I will NEVER eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"Can you please fire everyone who works the drive-thru?  They take one car at a time (take the order, payment and give food).  Today was the 2nd time I've shown up and ended up leaving after almost 8 minutes sitting there at the speaker and ended up no where.  I went to Burger King where I was helped right away, I'll be going there from now on."}
{"text":"Nice staff, clean restaurant and the food was delivered quickly and piping hot. I suspect there's been a management change from before and maybe a remodeling, in any event it was what I expect from Wendy's and there's no reason not to come back."}
{"text":"I agree with others that I would give it a zero if I could. One of the most rude cashier and I don't expect anything from a fast food joint, but a simple hi and checking to make sure your order is correct is a service even a high schooler can provide. Will not come through here again."}
{"text":"As with all of the fast food restaurants in this area of Ohio River Blvd., this place is dumpy and dirty.  The staff is also poorly supervised ,and I've been privvy to more store gossip, drama, and horseplay than I've ever experienced in any restaurant, fast food or otherwise.  They get so loud back in the kitchen that we will often stop our conversation in the dinning room to wait for them to quiet down a bit before we continue.  The food itself is generally passable."}
{"text":"Messed up order.. Rude, ghetto workers with bad customer service skills... Some Wendy's are great but this one apparently lacks good management."}
{"text":"I know I know it's fast food. But seriously get it together people. I was so excited when I pulled up to the drive thru and saw 3/4 cars in line and thought great hot fries. I pull up to the speaker and was great by someone not enthusiastic or friendly. Just \"hi can I help you\"  I ordered spicy chicken with cheese, small combo with a coke. I pulled forward and paid my $7.48. I go my food and pulled away. I reached into the bag a grabbed a HOT FRY!  So hot that I had to hold it out the window to let it cool off.  I was so excited and rushing home to sink my teeth in that spicy chicken with cheese... I get home , sit down and pull out the sammy and first thing I check for is the cheese. Oops sorry but no cheese. You paid for it but thanks anyway. And then I look over at the top bun and found what appears to be an attempt at lettuce and a tomato. No cheese anywhere.  Always check your food ALWAYS!!!!"}
{"text":"This location has really gone down hill. I Had a late night at work so, at the request of my family, I went to Wendy's. Worst decision ever!! The meat looked petrified. The new Gouda bacon cheeseburger had maybe a teaspoon of the cheese sauce and it was overloaded with fancy lettuce. The baconator burger bun looked like it fought its way into the wrapper. It was falling apart and the meat patty looked petrified as well. Now, let's move onto the fries. Soggy and loaded with oil like they had been recooked a second time. Needless to say I will be phoning this location in the morning in hopes of speaking with a manager who actually cares about the quality of product they serve, because quality was definitely not their recipe this evening. The food went into the trash. Feeling robbed of the $27 dollars it cost for three lousy meals with frostys, which by the way, was the only thing we didn't throw away."}
{"text":"ok, so i had to work an extra long shift. i love wendy's hamburgers. but with a lot to choose from either way anymore you're spending $10..00 so i decide on this wendy's, i have eaten there many times and have noticed they are having staffing troubles. so i get my nice hot hamburger, and stone cold fries. the fries were old and had so much salt i couldent eat them. what the heck is going on.. they up the pay their to $11.00 an hour and the place has gotten worse... looks like its in and out from now on.."}
{"text":"Wow, no customer service.  The one girl behind the counter acts like you owe her money instead of trying to place an order.  Forget it if you ask for a spoon or napkin thats like asking for her first born!  I felt like I had to shut up and get what I get and get the heck out of there!  Never go there again!"}
{"text":"Drive thru is always ridiculously slow. Even at non-rush hours. Luckily they are in an area without a lot of options otherwise they'd be out of business."}
{"text":"I love wendys food but I am always deterred from going here due to the lack of customer service. Sometimes I want it so much that I just suffer through but I don't feel like I should have to. They always ALWAYS get something wrong on my order whether I'm ordering 1 thing for myself or 6 things for my whole family. Something is always done wrong without fail. They need a new system of taking orders or something because it's just a universal problem not just at this location either but across the board. Also they took away the Caesar wrap which I LOVED!!! I go there way less now that it's off the menu. Booo bring back the Caesar wraps."}
{"text":"Went through drive through. The burgers and fries were cold. Ordered 2 jr bac cheese but only had bacon on one. Ordered a tea but they only gave us water. Ordered a honey mustard and bbq but only got honey mustard. They were out of ketchup packets and didn't give us the receipt. When we asked for he receipt we realized that they charged us higher than what they we owed. Would not recommend. This is my first negative Wendy's experience:/ they were nice enough guys but I would highly recommend better quality service and more honesty/ providing the receipt."}
{"text":"I remember back in the day, when Wendy's had those colorful hanging plastic beads and fake Tiffany lamps. LOL  But NOW, Wendy's is all modern and all grown up. And it sort of looks like the inside of a starship. Warp factor two. Engage!  But I've always liked Wendy's and I liked what they've done with the boring old setup. You need to sit in front of their TV, watch an old movie or Sports Center and enjoy the gas heated fireplace to fully appreciate it. Really nice!  The Chili is still the same thankfully.  Can someone explain those foiled hot sauce packets? Soy, Gum, something another's LOL. The burgers, Single, Double, Triple are good, but they're no longer made fresh. Ugh. Take look at that sad, dried Double they served me.   But the Chicken sandwiches are very good and like their idea of putting them on pretzel bread. Nice!  So, A-Okay three stars for taking up a notch."}
{"text":"I order a spicy chicken sandwich which wasn't cook well at all. The chicken was old and had been dozen for to long that lost all the flavor. It was so bad I couldn't even eat it. When I went to complain all what they say was it look that way because of the seasoning in the chicken. Which wasn't even had flavor of spicy or any flavor. Your better off having something else."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review based off this location only..  So glad at least one Wendy's in town the food taste right!!  The food taste like it was cooked on a clean grill the fries taste like the oil was clean!!  This Wendy's is always clean and the food always taste great!  Our cashier was very friendly as well!!"}
{"text":"This is a joint Wendy's/Tim Hortons location and is one of the few classic chain restaurants in the area. PD M's review gives you all the details on the reno so I won't give a repeat except to say that it is a nicely updated location and does have decent parking.  I came in for a take-out order inside the store at the counter.  It was lunch time on Saturday so there was plenty of traffic inside the store and out in the drive-thru.  The staff here on this visit were fantastic.  The server at the cash was friendly yet super efficient.  As I waited and watched the kitchen staff work, the girl assembling the orders was also super efficient and I didn't have to wait long.  I didn't see any ketchup dispensers or a napkin/cutlery/condiments station and I did have to ask to make sure I got some ketchup packets with my orders, so this is one improvement that would make the place 5 stars.  Otherwise, the staff here made the renovation worthwhile, because there were no screw-ups in the orders despite the quick service, the food was hot and tasted fresh, and the friendliness of the staff made it a completely pleasant experience.  I'm in the neighbourhood frequently enough and will definitely consider lunch here more often."}
{"text":"About the worst experience I have ever had eating out. First, they forgot about our order and we had to wait 10 minutes for what should have been a 3 minute wait tops for the size of order we had. Second, they made our goodly completely wrong. Third, they were extremely rude and not attentive to our needs at all, and four they were laughing about the whole ordeal and taking it as some kind of a joke. Every customer I saw in there while we were there had the same exact issues. It's no wonder that this location is so slow. Tables were left dirty, food not up to par with any Wendy's I have ever had, just a disappointment all around. The only reasonable thing that they did for us was give us the corporate number so that we can call and let them know. Completely a disgrace to the company."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a nice hot Wendy's chili,  fresh cut red onions and saltines crackers.  Try your over their baked potato. Plus seniors receive a free beverage."}
{"text":"I went here tonight to grab some food for friends at the urgent care around here. I'm baffled. First off, I give this place one star because of the girl taking my order. She was polite, apologized for making me wait on the intercom and whatnot. She is the ONLY reason they get a star! Granted, this is a drive though so I wasn't expecting ABOVE AND BEYOND service but a hello, good evening or do you need anything else would have been nice. The first guy at the window looked confused and the second guy who gave me my food didn't even say one word to me not even when I asked for napkins etc. All he could care about was how he had messed up the order in front of me. Not surprisingly, that car parked, and the driver entered the store... I would never go here if it wasn't a request from my friends. If you want better customer service, go to their competitor, CHICK FIL A. Order a salad, whatever your heart desires and they will ALWAYS BE NICE or at the very least, acknowledge you!"}
{"text":"My kid wanted Wendy's tonight.  10 piece nuggets, and stacker with ketchup only.  Sounds easy, right?  Well, while still at the window, I look at the burger,  I complained about the party being burnt.  Manager says..it's the grill.  I just told him, never Mind!!!!  Never again.  I see why they only have 1 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"The drivethrough road is very poorly designed and dangerous for the cars... retards should learn from California constructions particular in LA... you could drive-in from left or right in A drive through in LA. so not to waste my precious time i smoked tires to make a uturn right on their parking lot while retards were lagging to move. So the disturbance was there for a reason!"}
{"text":"There is no doubt why the place was empty. I had a pretty identical experience to the reviewers before me - staff was speaking inappropriately, there was like 6 of them there. The first 3 tables I thought about sitting at were prohibitively dirty, which with all those guys back there talking one word figure they could have wiped down some tables. Also flies, if there were flies in the dining room you have to imagine there are flies in the kitchen, falling in the food in the oil, etc. it's inexpensive to get rid of flies too, a multinational corporation can afford to prevent flies, so the management must be pretty lax. We ended up leaving."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Very rude worker.s.  Got a salad and the lettuce was brown, no cheese, wrong dressing.  I rather drive to another Wendy's regardless of the distance.  They need to train their workers to be courteous to the customers!!!"}
{"text":"This is my go to Wendys! I've never had a Wendy's so close to me before and I'm loving it!  They always get my order right and my food is always fresh!  I just wish they weren't so stingy when it comes to sauces, sometimes they don't even ask you if you want sauces or will only give you 1 of each knowing you ordered a few combos :/ Just make sure you ask for extra sauce and ketchup too!  Don't get stingy like Mcdonalds now!  -___-"}
{"text":"They got rid of the freakin spicy nuggets they are so good does anyone know why they stopped selling them it makes me mad. I think they should bring them back anyway the people were very rude took way to long and there was a hair in my chicken sandwich"}
{"text":"I'm finally through with this place and the RUDE employees. I like Wendy' for the food but if I have to put up with the crappy employees then I'll go somewhere else. Sounds like they need a new manager to straighten it all out"}
{"text":"Fast and simple Wendy's! Ordered three items off the value menu and I really enjoyed the Chili Cheese Nachos which was my first time eating it."}
{"text":"Drive Thru closed at 1pm? At Mercy South & wanted a juicy filling 4for $4 deal advertised on my Wendys App......and google clearly states \"Open til 2pm\"!!Hummm. That daggum app really does intensify the munchies. Oh well, MckeyDeez InTheMornin#WhatUpWendy?"}
{"text":"I walked in around 1:50 PM got in line with 3 other customers... I was in a hurry. So I figured some \"fast\" food would be a good idea. Waited in line for 20 minutes and didn't even have enough time to order so I left the restaurant without getting an order in. Never going to Wendy's again :)"}
{"text":"For a chain this store is OK. Clean and friendly staff...and the place is clean too! The food is hot most of the time. Drive thru gets my order filled correctly every time. No shorted items that I can remember. Their prices are higher than another Wendy's less than a mile from this one. Probably because they are so close to the highway."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Wendy's we've been to. We got there about 10pm and the young man that waited on us was very helpful and very nice. Our food was hot and very fresh. Are the prices more expensive?  Yes.  But people your In an airport so of course it is and in our opinion it was well worth paying a bit more rather than get in our car, look up a place to eat on navigation and drive there. We wanted to eat and get in our car and head straight home for our 3 hour drive."}
{"text":"I've had the worst experience at this Wendy's.  I could do a long rant but I'll make this short.  1) My 5 year old was served a RAW cheeseburger.  They walked this cow right through the damn kitchen. 2) Only one employee seemed to speak enough English for me to attempt to complain. 3) The ONLY thing I was given in compensation was a free kiddie frosty.  The manager (wherever they were hiding) didn't even come out to apologize.  The employees were too busy doing a chant for Obama than to worry about actually doing there jobs.  While I don't care who they wanted for president, it's a bit disturbing that this was okay with management.  If my son gets sick, I promise you that compensation will not be just a frosty.  I've worked near here for over 10 years and it used to be good but it has really gone downhill over the years."}
{"text":"I love the asiago ranch chicken sandwich with a spicy chicken. The bun was fresh and the chicken tasted like it had just been made. The salads are fresh and un-wilted. The employees are helpful and smile. I like this location a lot."}
{"text":"Had the single cheeseburger combo for $5.99.  Experience was good."}
{"text":"I give up on this Wendy's. It should be noted that my experience with them is drive-thru related only. Yes the food is cheap and the service is fast and friendly but if you don't get everything you pay for what is the point. I decided to give them one more try since we were in the area and this time it was the chicken nuggets they forget. Of course my copilot who checked the bags said it was all in there and it wasn't until we got home that we realized they were missing and it just wasn't worth it to go back. Sadly this has happened before at this location. The Baconator fries were a mess and it is because the fries started out limp and soggy. Years ago Wendy's changed the their fries and they just aren't the same."}
{"text":"Nice looking location, but they refuse to honor T-Mobile Tuesday deals like all other Wendy's."}
{"text":"I come to this Wendy's more often recently because I'm in this area more now.  Evans and Kipling is pretty much a light industrial area and this Wendy's is a combo Wendy's and mini drive through Tim's much like the one on the Queensway not far really but the \"Etobicoke\" Wendy's on the Queensway is the \"nice\" Wendy's.  The most depressing Tim's/Wendy's is the one near Kipling station on Dundas, the one on the Queensway is the nicest most modern one and this Wendy's is something in between.    This Wendy's feels more old school and the parking lot is shaped oddly.  When going to Kipling to exit it's awkward because you have to watch 2 drive in exits, the Tim's and the Wendy's not to mention cars coming in and when leaving cars are whizzing coming downhill from the overpass.  The inside of this Wendy's could use an overhaul but I wonder being in a blue collar area if they will fix this place up like the one on the Queensway which has the couches and fireplace not to mention the self serve Coke variety machines.    At the end of the day this is still Wendy's food which is in my opinion one of the better fast food franchises out there now.  However just like the other nearby Wendy's and basically all McD's these days this place needs a much overdue face lift to brighten things up."}
{"text":"This is not a fast food restaurant.  This is the slowest restaurant in Charlotte. None of the employees seem to care, either.  New employees all around!"}
{"text":"Not sure why it even says clear as day on their window that they're open until 1am because for the third time, my brother and i pulled up to the drive-thru and no one answers. This has happened around 11p and even 12a as well. This evening you could see 2 employees just standing behind the dining room cashiers counter on their phones and it's been the same guy every time since the same one car is in the parking lot. Evidently night time is the wrong time to want Wendy's from this location."}
{"text":"Is it bad when the drive thru staff recognizes your voice? Beyond that, I'll never admit how often I eat Wendy's.  It's a fast food chain, the quality varies little and the staff comes and goes.  But a trend I've noticed at all fast food drive thrus lately is they want to hurl the food at you the second you pull up, and they barely wait till you have your drink/change/card in hand before they slam the window in your face.  How much do napkins really cost?  By the sudden scarcity of napkins in my bag (and not just here, all over the place) I am assuming they must be pretty expensive.     The biggest problem here, is that no one listens to the customer.  They listen for exactly as long as they need to to get the basics of your order.  By not active listening, they create this sense that we, the customers, are taking them away from something really important.     I don't go through a drive thru to validate my self worth, so I don't care if they don't make me feel special and loved, but for god's sake, listen when I ask for a straw, napkins or condiments!"}
{"text":"Every time that I have been to this location.  I always leave happy.  Not only do I love their $ menu, but each time, the service is great.  They are always asking me how my day has been and more importantly, they are smiling.  I love that."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is right by Paradise Valley Mall.  It has a completely revamped look, which is awesome.  I would recommend trying the Cheesey Chedderburgers on the dollar menu.  They are so great.  Plus, they're on the dollar menu....Hello?!?!  They are really fast and friendly there.  They also have those cool looking soda machines, if you like that kind of thing, which I do.  You get to choose different flavors of coke you would like.  It's just really cool."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is great! The building is old but the staff is friendly and remembers their regulars. They are kind to the high school kids that hang out there in between school functions as well. It is good Wendy's food."}
{"text":"We came here under the pretense that the meat was be \"good 'never frozen' quality\", as per their advertisements. We left unsure about the truth of such claims.   We ordered a plain cheeseburger, the only way to test the quality of a fart food chain. Fast food chain*. The bread was considerably underwhelming and the burger meat itself was no different than that of McDonald, who (presumably) freezes their meat.   Further, we ordered a side of Small French Fries. We found them slightly too potatoey, which is perhaps an indication of their lack of sodium content. My girlfriend remarked that they just made her want McDonald's Small French Fries.   Whoever Wendy is, I would recommend her to take a lesson from Mr. McDonald -- perhaps don't focus on the lack of freezing the meat, I'm favor of giving more attention to the quality of the bun and the saltiness of the Small French Fries."}
{"text":"Filthy. Slow.  Painful to watch the poor girl try to do simple tasks.  It was weird.  She took my husbands order.  Cleaned a tray.  Zoned out.  Took my order.  Cleaned a tray.  Took my sons order.  Cleaned a tray.  Took my daughters order.  Cleaned a tray.  Talked to her boyfriend who was lounging against the counter.  Took 3 min to fill the drinks.  5 min later, the food was ready.  We were the only customers."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since my positive review in October.....tonights visit was ridiculous....the place was NOT busy.....just a handful of customers and yet it took nearly 10 minutes to place my order and then 17 more minutes to get my order.....(2 sandwiches, 3 fries, and 2 jr. cheeseburgers) .....the real issue?.......there was a young teen at the counter who jumped in front of me 3 times, basically harassing a female cashier....he wanted free food, wanted to borrow money, wanted a employee discount.......ridiculous......just an ignorant little clown, making a nuisance and big show of himself....he also interacted with other employees and did finally manage to get a free large drink.....while this foolishness was occurring, the Manager just wandered around, allowing this idiocy to go on for the length of my visit... ANYWAY.....while waiting, other customers returned their orders for corrections, another fellow was highly agitated, having waited 20 minutes already....I got my order and left.....a minute later realized my fries were stone cold and hard and when I got home.....had the wrong sandwiches anyway ! What a mess, waste of time, waste of money......just total aggravation....I wasn't even about to return to the place this evening.......and actually......I won't return to this place.......PERIOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hi Friends,  Tonight I ordered a Triple burger with NO cheese.  This is because my Mom is allergic to cheese.  The monitor said \"No cheese\" - and I did not check the burger (which had fries on top) when I received my order.  Guess what - it had CHEESE - melted - all over the meat.  Picking this up involved a 30 minute round trip drive.  Your food is really good!!  But please - PLEASE - pay closer attention customer requests."}
{"text":"First off this wendys has a 3+ rating on google and I accidently went here...They earned this 2 star overall rating they have..... Waited in line at the drive through for over 10 minutes. Thats cool Im a patient dude. Ordered just a burger. When I got home and opened the bag I saw a burger that looked like it was squeezed or smahed intentionally. I have never gone out of my way to give a bad review but I will never be back to this Wendys. Ever. Thanks for wasting my time and my money!"}
{"text":"Not a bad Wendy's. They used to get my order wrong a lot and it looks like they have it together now.  The inside is clean, although on my last inside visit it smelled a bit like sewage. The employees working there were nice and professional.  I usually get the 4 for $4 since it's such a good deal."}
{"text":"Whenever we order they always forget to put something or dont charge something that we ask for. the location is by far the worst wendys ive been too!"}
{"text":"Like obviously?  its fast food and all, however, ?I had a decent experience, went drive through because I was just passing through and I think it was one of the fastest drive-thrus I've ever experienced. SO big thumbs up in that case. However, the fries were kind cold figured they had been there for a while, and chicken burger was mediocre, kind of sloppy?. So, I'd give it 2 stars in fast food rating obvioulsy you can find better."}
{"text":"Very friendly late night staff. Super happy that the to see it open after 11:30. Fries was hot and crispy, chicken sandwich was fresh and hot. Only reason not a 5 star I requested lettuce only got everything but. Otherwise perfect post concert meal. Loving me some Las Vegas"}
{"text":"The kids and I went here last night after I got off work. The worst service ever! This was my first and last time to this location. Pulled up to the drive through to place my order the grumpy person on the other side didn't feel like she wanted to be there. When I pulled up to pay she looked mad. Not even a thank you . I don't care if you hate your damn job bish get the stick out of your assistance and smile. If that was me at my job I'd get in trouble.  I called the manager today and she herself, was apologetic but didn't even offer anything at all. If that was other restaurants they would be on it trying to get your service back yah not Wendy's.  DON'T GO HERE."}
{"text":"Ordered a #2 without onions and tomatoes. Order was even correct on the drive-thru screen yet they gave me a #1 WITH onions and tomato. How do you fuck something up that bad?"}
{"text":"This might sound ridiculous, but this is the best fast food place around! The food is always hot, it's always right, and the employees are extremely nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Wendy's 3 days in a row ..love the new summer Berry chicken salad ..but there is no consistency when I get the salads ..first day got a half order with extra chicken didn't charge for extra chicken,second day got a large extra chicken was charged for extra chicken $1.25  and didn't mind that but when they handed me the salad it was half order and I asked to 4 dressings love the Berry dressing got the large after I brought it to there attention but two were the wrong dressings,third day ordered a small he tried to charge me $2.50 for extra chicken on a small salad then changed it to $125 after I brought it to their attention..lady who was cooking said they charge which was fine with me but when I got salad it hardly had any chicken she tried to say there was extra but there wasn't..stop going to get the salads I love because of the inconsistency..and while I was there person working drive thru kept sneezing but never went to wash their hands totally gross I work in the food industry and ya better wash ur hands after sneezing"}
{"text":"Got my order correct, but food tastes off. Fries tasted stale and soggy; tomato and lettuce on sand which is wilty and unappetizing, plus mayo everywhere; Coke Zero tastes like drink machine might be broke (undrinkable). Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Great fresh food!  Three only reason I didn't give five stars is because the drive thru line was taking way too long.  Besides they, you can't beat the super hot crispy fresh French fries, a Baconator and Frosty...fast food doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"Our group of 11 overwhelmed the restaurant? 45 minutes from the time we ordered until when we received our food. Fast food yeah right! Also saw angry people honk horns and leave the drive thru due to the wait..."}
{"text":"Worst. Seriously the staff was miserable looking and rude as hell. The cashier acted like he didn't even want to work and other worker was wearing her hair down while cooking and messing with the food. I'm really disappointed in this including it being in fort Mill I expected more but I'll won't be back..."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely hurrendous! The workers here are so disrespectful and lazy. I couldn't even name all of them because ALL of them are unprofessional and rude as heck. Corporate needs to pay them a visit because they need to see what kind of workers they are hiring. Today I waited like 20 minutes for my order at the drive thru. All the workers inside were laughing and joking. There were no other cars, it was just us. The women that work there are so moody and rude. I had this woman stare at me and start laughing for no reason. This place needs to get shut down. No wonder why there are never any customers there. If you want to wait 20 mins for your food while the workers are laughing and joking and if you want to be treated rudely, this is the perfect place for you. This place is disgusting. The workers are obviously only there for the paycheck and could careless about the way they present themselves or how they treat customers."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever.. Very slow rude & unprofessional..Over all just a bunch of ghetto ignore works there.. SMH"}
{"text":"Probably should give 1 star, if that. Sadly I've had more messed up orders at this particular fast food establishment than anywhere else - EVER!  They are so incompetent here, from everyone up to management. Just there last week after swearing I'd never go back and I was the only person inside the restaurant at 8 pm. I tried their new kiosk thing for the first time (annoying), then stood at the counter for close to 20 minutes while I was ignored by everyone including the manager while they continued to take and complete all the drive thru orders. Hey...I'm a paying customer too, why must I stand around waiting endlessly?  Also, the manager fills her time while making customers wait by typing on her laptop with the gloves on they use to make food and to keep things sanitary. Wanna bet she types on that with her plain, old dirty hands too - then compromising the \"clean\" gloves when making food?  This place was also really dirty, especially the drink machines. Yet the staff has time to stand around looking bored and not preparing my food.  Sadly all these idiots will now get even higher pay next year thanks to those who voted for a minimum wage increase. These guys don't even earn what they get paid now, no less more in the future."}
{"text":"Recently Wendy's has become one of my favorite fast food restaurants if not my favorite. I love their tropical iced green tea. It is very delicious and I 100% recommend. I love the food they serve at Wendy's but for the service at this location. The employees look as if they don't give a shit at all and they've served me and other customers cold fries and nuggets on multiple occasions and have forgotten many items in my order including a frosty, fry and 4 piece nugget! I do not feel that is acceptable. Sure I could of looked through my food before I left but they should do their job."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff that try to remember their customers. While they do get a lot of new people, as it is a popular job for those who are in highschool, it is still a nice place. New people mess up sometimes, but the managers are always friendly and make sure that the staff are always nice to their patrons. Overall a very friendly atmosphere, even if the food isn't the best for you."}
{"text":"I love coming here! Everyone is always so friendly. Really great customer service. I appreciate the \"white glove treatment\" for a cheap fast food place. Keep it up, guys!"}
{"text":"The slowest Wendy's I've ever been to. 20 minutes in the drive thru is crazy for \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"There foods always good and fresh they never mess up an order super fast! Inside neeeeeeds to be renovated but besides that and staff super nice"}
{"text":"Not sure what was happening here tonight, but they were serving orders in reverse order as they came in, so as people ordered after you, your order got pushed back further and further. It took 20 minutes for me to get my food and even longer for the people I was with to get their food because the restaurant ran out of chili but continued to sell it. A woman two orders after them ordered chili and was refunded quickly and then given her food, but it took another 10 minutes for them to even tell the people I was with that they ran out of chili. And when they finally did, they didn't even offer them something else. Terrible night to be at Wendy's!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE OMG....we just stopped by after visiting the Apple store at the beautiful mall. We are trying to get meals for the trip back to Columbia. RUDE so rude!!  The sign is also very dark- we cannot see the food on the board. She was so so rude we cancelled our order and went in to speak to a manager. Absolutely no help, no apology- her reply- \"I talked to the girl and asked her what was wrong and she needs to improve her attitude\". That was pretty much it. So we went to McDonalds for Happy Meals which is what the kids wanted anyway. We asked a girl at McDonalds what was up with that Wendy's. She was like \"Ew...it's old over there\". All is well- we are cruisin' back with our quarter pounders!"}
{"text":"Went to Wendy's with my partner. Order from a girl named Kassandra. Didn't get our order right. Had a snappy attitude after the order. Before we were about to pull out of the parking lot. One sandwich was missing. So we went back. She takes our order again. This time, she sounded annoyed. As soon as we pulled up to the window again. She had a pissed off face. Overall, this was a terrible experience and to boo, the food was repulsive. The crispy chicken sandwich was like a wet sponge. The new grilled chicken sandwich tasted like vomit. Fries was soggy and smashed to the bottom to the box. Never again eating there."}
{"text":"I always go to this Wendy's drive thru and have never ha any issues. My mom loves the apple pecan chicken salad which comes with simply dressed pomegranate vinegarette and a bag of pecans. They never have an issue giving extra dressing or another bag of pecans. Thank you Wendy's for making my mom happy ;-)!"}
{"text":"What can I say? All Wendy's are the same.. Just like how I would review any McDonald's. Burger was fine, I was served politely and didn't have to wait. Good experience, but not the Timmys side lol"}
{"text":"I have no hesitation in giving this review one star.  I wanted a Frosty, but left without anything.  The patron two cars in front of me apparently thought she was ordering at a fine dining establishment.  It's Wendys not a fancy steakhouse. While waiting for this person to finish ordering her lenghtly and detailed order, a bum tried to ask me for change.  I promptly told him to get the F*** out of here.  I took my own advice and did the same.  Will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"I only come here for the natural lemonades (not sure how natural they truly are, but the strawberry lemonade is divine!). The staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times I lost count! I love their chicken sandwich and cheese bacon french fries. The problem is they always mess up my orders, ALWAYS! Besides that fact It is so rare coming here and finding an employee in a good mood :/ I know it is a fast food place but a little bit of patience, courtesy and a smile can't hurt anybody."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst Wendy's in Charlotte. My expectations are never that high when it comes to fast food but they are ridiculous. We usually always end up going here late at night when there are NO cars yet still have a 10 minute wait. On top of the waiting time they almost always forget something. The only reason we go here is because its on the same street as our house. With a newborn who needs constant attention and a husband who can only cook a bowl of cereal, this is a last resort."}
{"text":"Very nice staff I'm not sure how they do it. I use to work in fast food and I began to hate everyone so I give them props for that I hope for a bright future for them. Will always be the place to go when I need a snack of a drink"}
{"text":"dude, i am sorry, but when i have to explain to you what hot tea is, something is terribly wrong. it is on your menu!! you should know what i am talking about when i ask for hot tea. and no i am not talking about getting your regular tea without ice, which is what you tried to serve me the other night. unacceptable, no matter how you try to justify it. if it is on your displayed menu, you should know what it is and how to serve it."}
{"text":"Angela and her staff always take care of me when I am there. She been there a long time and it nice to see someone who cares bout where they work. I been going here for years!!  I think this is one of the best Wendy's around !!!"}
{"text":"After reviewing the Starship McDonald's up in Flag last week, I noticed I forgot to post my review of this Next Generation fast food place from three months ago. D'oh!  Wow!  You have to give Wendy's credit for thinking outside the box.  This fast food restaurant is like no other I've been to. As some of my photos can attest, this is more of a comfy chair club with a lot of eye distractions than fast food chain with plastic chairs. For instance, it has a huge flat screen HDTV blasting ESPN's Sports Center that is situated above a faux fireplace. \"A\" for effort!  This Wendy's also has a coffee/barista station.  Though the \"Joe\" tastes more like a water down Seattle Best. Too bad they couldn't get a Tim Horton's contract, eh!  Also new, is the Coca-Cola brand soda dispensers that tends to make everything taste like Dr Pepper.  So if you are from Texas, this might be a good thing. LOL  As for the food, Wendy's continues to let the corporate kitchen rethink their menu items.  The food is very good and it will be interesting to see where they go with it after a couple of years.  So, in line with my thinking about most fast food places, Three Stars \"A-OK\". But I'll throw in a 1/2 Star for effort and originality.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"When you walk into this Wendy's during the winter - the first aroma you smell is 'pee'. I wonder if the smell is due to the fact that bathrooms are opposite the entrance, but all I can say is that, this specific Wendy's typically smells of urine.  Depending on which staff member you get - service can be 'okay'. I had a girl that took my order who put my order in a bag when I specifically said 'for here', she did the same to the man behind me.   I also had to ask for a new cup as her hand touched the inside of my cup when she was grabbing it for me. The manager reminded her not to touch the inside of cups.  And what's with Wendy's plastic ketchup containers - get with the program and use paper cups.   This place is so-so."}
{"text":"This place gets the worst customer service award...the whole staff was very unprofessional, rude  and they seemed like they had no clue how a fast food restaurant works...even the people in the drive thru came in just to complain...won't be coming back here ever...."}
{"text":"Food was meh.    Employees were terrible.  The only exception was a very friendly,  older white lady.  A younger employee was sitting in the lobby,  on her cell phone,  cursing and calling her manager a bitch.  Call me old-fashioned,  but I expect a little more professionalism from someone in a uniform,  even if it is \"just fast food\"."}
{"text":"Okay, we ordered a bacon actor combo and a grilled asiago chicken club combo. Both no buns, and salads instead of fries (we are on a Keto diet) 7 minutes AFTER ordering they told us they just put grilled chicken down and offered me spicy or homestyle instead-I declined, stating we do a low carb diet. So to make up for waiting nearly 20 minutes-they offer us small frosties. Again, no we do low carb. The manager NEVER even acknowledged that we were there. I will never go to this location again. Customer service is king and they have NO skills"}
{"text":"I waited almost 10 minutes at the drive thru. Nobody answered or told me there was a wait or anything so I pulled up to the window. The workers literally looked at me and walked by without saying anything. I finally had to yell at the window to get somebody's attention. When the girl came, her excuse for not taking my order was that she was in the bathroom. This is not the first time I had to wait an extended period just for somebody to answer at the drive thru. I go to Burger King same times and get my order taken right away. This Wendy's used to be an excellent location but the new staff has been horrendous at the drive thru at night time."}
{"text":"I'm upping them to 4 stars, based on repeated success at the drive through.  Nobody is quicker.  It just works.  I order, I pay, and I get my food, all in seconds.  I usually get a salad, and they do a nice job - fresh lettuce, well prepared other bits."}
{"text":"Try harder, please.  This used to be a great location. The food was always put together with care, it was hot, the chicken juicy.  Now, we get attitude from the staff, nasty attitude from the younger staff, the chicken tastes rubbery, the fries were almost raw, and they left us sitting in the parking lot waiting for them to bring out our drive-thru order. I finally had to go in and they had totally forgotten about us.  They tried to give us our cold food and I made them make it fresh.  I was SO not please."}
{"text":"This is the place if you want lots of ice and very little soda on your cup!!!!    Nothing else noteworthy. Just a Wendy's.... Yep, just a Wendy's!!!"}
{"text":"I can't stand a place where the employee has crazy hair and no hair net. I'm glad there was no hair in my food.   It's all over the place on his head...."}
{"text":"I normally don't yelp for Fast Food but the experience my family had at this Wendy's needed to be posted.   My mother-in-law is in a wheelchair and sick with Cancer. She lives in an elderly home and we spring her from there once a week. About a month ago we took her around to do some errands and she really wanted to stop by Wendy's for lunch. We get there and the place is beyond clean. I've never seen a fast food place so clean. The cashier that took our order, which I believe she was the manager on duty (at least that's what her name plate said), was extremely helpful and patient with us. She had a smile on the whole time.   After we ordered our food we went and found a nice little table in the corner to enjoy our food. The cashier didn't call our name, instead she brought our food to us and saw to it if we needed anything else. The food was hot and was your typical fast food fare and thought it was pretty good. At some point towards the end of our meal the cashier came back to our table and asked if we needed anything else. I've never had such amazing customer service at a fast food place... or pretty much most places."}
{"text":"This is odd to say but before this visit I had never been a wendy.... shocking I know that why I got caught off guard the small is what other fast food place medium,  Its clean, somewhat fast and despite it is fast , it taste better then mcdonalds and burger king and price is the same so I guess Wendy might be my preffer fastfood place not that i would eat fast food too often"}
{"text":"My family and I usually get the 4 for $4 meal, but today was my sibling got the chicken blt 4 for $4 meal and his burger didn't seem put together with effort. The burger was poorly put together which disappoints me because after 2 years I have had the best service at this location."}
{"text":"Went here after dinner to grab a frosty but gave up after an extended wait. The cashiers were busy chatting with their friends and couldn't be bothered to help anyone in line. The location also seemed a bit sketchy; I'd avoid this one. Try Panera Bread across the street."}
{"text":"Bad food and attitudes Also I posted a pic of my food while ch was hideas and it was deleted"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible,  especially as a driver bringing in 3 car loads of church youth.  Go to exit 49 instead, not this exit 41.  Ladies bathroom had no functional toilets.  Men's room was wrecked and sticky, with used toilet tissue on the floor and sink. Son said there was a used condom on the one toilet.  Gas station bathroom nearby was locked/secured and also had no toilet paper.  Entire area looked scary, transients wandering in, and hardly a nice word from the staff.  Everyone needs food and a pleasant place to rest, but this entire facility just had a menace about it.  As a grown man who has been on lots of road trips, I can handle some crazy, but I would not take anyone else here, plus I would prefer to spend my money elsewhere.  JHC, that was piss poor.  Skip it, you will be glad you did.  If you are heading I-85 Northbound, continue past to Exit 49 and the Wendy's there."}
{"text":"This Exit 49 location is a perfectly fine lunch stop.  DO NOT go to the Wendy's on Exit 41.  We had three car loads of church youth on a road trip, stopped at 41, then left horrified and found this Wendy's at exit 49."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I don't complain about them getting my good wrong because I use to work there. EVERY time I get a potato it's brown they shouldn't be brown if they've only had them up for 2 hours. Selling people old food,always getting orders wrong and the  food is always cold! It's ridiculously frustrating. Especially when, I know how easy it is to do that job. Even easier to get a order correct!!   PILOT NEEDS TO STEP THIER GAME UP, THEY ARE GIVING WENDYS A BAD NAME!!"}
{"text":"They got our order wrong which is not a big deal since I had a special request - bun on the side instead of a completed breakfast sandwich (I'm doing low carb but my travel companion wanted the bun). Instead we were charged for a whole sandwich plus an extra bun and the cheese from the sandwich was all stuck to the bun. We caught it before they even brought out our order so it's not like they had to discard any of the food. The employee who had to remake the food was very visibly annoyed and downgraded the cheese that came on my sandwich. Still wouldn't have been an issue if it wasn't for the attitude. It's Wendy's so as quality goes we got what we paid for."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service of any Wendy's I've been too. Stood in line while a slack worker just ignored me and carried on a looooong conversation with customers in front. I walked out hoping to get better service in the drive through. It was even worse. The drive through speaker sounds is terrible!!Would love to address this with a manager but it didn't look like anybody cared enough to listen or help."}
{"text":"Extremely rude and slow customer service!  Special requests at the register will earn you a dirty look or an exasperated sigh, as if the cashier in front of you was actually not getting paid to do her job.  This also happened when I wanted to give a complaint to the manager; thought she was giving it her all not to tackle and strangle me.  Kitchen staff is uncomfortable to listen to and watch.  Have seen the guy at the fry station swearing at his coworkers and throwing equipment around when it was busy, which made other people around me upset, too.  Have also heard from the counter inside one of the workers taking orders call someone in the drive thru a set of horrendous names.  There's a 1/3 chance they'll get your order wrong here, and you'll have to wait a long time for your order for this being a fast-food service.  Staff and management needs to get their sh*t together.  Dining area is constantly filthy.  There are always splotches of food on the tables and wrapping papers and bits of food on the floor.  The entire building also needs to be updated.  It feels like I'm eating in a dilapidated building from 20 years ago.    The same goes for the bathrooms.  Constantly dirty, out of toilet paper, or it reeks.  Hours are extremely inconvenient, again for this being a FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT.  10 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Not to mention workers will be visibly angry at you if you order something anywhere close to closing time.  DO NOT support this business.  If you want Wendy's, go to the Tarentum location down the street, it's a five-minute drive."}
{"text":"All you can eat chili, tastes great -see the promo info posted on the door for details of days after 4pm. Inside staff was friendly and said the onions were freshly added but still offered more fresh onions and cheese on top. A d of course the Frosty is always delicious. This good experience mad up for my disappointing previous visit, thank you to a great caring staff."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Wendy's I have been in for a really long time.  I eat at my favorite Wendy's restaurants at least three times a week.  I won't come back here.The owners need to redo the restaurant, including hiring a more energetic and speedier staff."}
{"text":"The people here act like you are a real inconvenience by coming in and giving them money. Staff is rude and abrasive."}
{"text":"I live about a mile from this Wendy's and it is one of only two drive-thru restaurants in the Stonecrest shopping center.  The other being Chick Fil A - which I love, but since they make the chicken, and a girl needs some beef and bacon every once in a while, Wendy's is my choice for drive-thru when I need lunch/dinner and don't feel like putting on a bra or changing out of my night night pants.    Located next to Firebird's and diagonal from the movie theater, the drive-thru line can get a little long at times, but it's never as long as the Chick.  The line usually moves along well and I have never had an issue with being charged wrong or not getting the correct items (this is for about 1 visit per month).    For the drive-thru only...  I usually order a baconator.  I figure if I am working towards a heart attack, I had best do it right.  I love their new fries, and mine have been at least warm and generally crispy every time I go.  They also give me enough ketchup for said fries that I don't have to split the packets open with a straight edge and run the fries through the corners to get the ketchup.  The tea is always good and the frosties make for a nice treat every once in a while.    I have never actually been inside of the restaurant, so I can't speak to the indoor conditions.  But the drive-thru serves it's purpose and I have always gotten what I expected."}
{"text":"Wendy's as a corporation really has been taking huge strides as of late to put forth a hip and cool image. Perky TV commercials, a social media presence that puts other fast food chains to shame, and pricing that aligns well with customer expectations, are among the few ways Wendy's is leading the charge.   Unfortunately, you can have all the best Internet presence and marketing savvy in the world, and still fall flat on the actual in-restaurant experience, which pretty much cancels everything out. This location was no exception.  I've usually gone to this location via the drive through, and haven't had too many issues with the food itself. But after my experience as a dine-in customer today, I'm thinking of staying clear of here for the foreseeable future.   For one, the staff seemed unresponsive. I didn't have an order taken for several minutes, despite being the only one in line.  Additionally, the facility was pretty much a bio hazard. The freestyle Coke machine's spill tray was overflowing, there were napkins and wrappers strewn on the floor, and the tables were covered in grime.   However, the biggest offense to me has to be the restroom, and a factor that made me question the sanitation levels of the employees and food stations. The soap dispenser was non functional, the urinal was clogged with toilet paper, and there was a funky smell.   Wendy's... Look... I love you guys, but you really need to enforce restaurant quality standards more religiously. This sort of thing impacts your brand way more than you might think, and no amount of sassy and clever Twitter posts can make up for this. Can we try a little harder next time? Thanks!"}
{"text":"I know, I know. It's Wendy's what should I expect, but went In for a early lunch with my daughter. Gloria, the cashier is COMPLETELY RUDE AS HELL!! I asked for a baked potato with EVERYTHING on it, simple enough right?!? WRONG!!!! She looks me dead in the face and said WHAT YOU MEAN?!? Really honey?? What do I mean?? EVERYTHING THAT YALL PUT ON POTATOES, that kinda everything. After her asking me 3 more times what I meant, her dumbass asked me if I only wanted more cheese. She needs to worry less about having attitudes with the customers and clean the dam dining room. Like I said I was there for an early lunch. There was brown lettuce and fries from the night before. The one star is because this was the first time that the bathrooms were clean when we went to wash our hands. Save yourself and go across the street to Zaxbys"}
{"text":"Hands down the worse Wendys I've ever been too. Food all over the floor and the bathrooms horrible! The manager yelled at several employees and slammed a soft drink on the floor. This manager needs to be fired. Everyone waited over 30 minutes to get food. Absolutely the worse customer service we've ever experienced."}
{"text":"How do you run out of chocolate frostys in August? They have managed this anomaly on several occasions. There will always be one item or ingredient they'll forget. CHECK EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"Deminator and I are dating. Sometimes Baked Potato with Cheese Sauce comes to play with us when we feel like spicing things up.  In all seriousness, though, Wendy's is my favorite fast food chain, and this particular location is great. The staff is nice, perfectly bilingual, and they won't get confused or give you the stink eye when you want to change something ( Yes, McDonald's, I'm talking about you)."}
{"text":"Never thought I would write a review about a Wendys but, we just went here because we were starving and did not want to cook. The man with the long red hair is awesome. When i receive exellent service i will always take the time to write a review. I dont remember his name but he was so polite and positive that i had to write this. You dont see that very often. Especially through a drive through. It was refreshing. Also the new fish sandwich is pretty great."}
{"text":"Dear Dave and his creepy freckle faced step daughter...  The food was cold.the burger was cold. The fries were cold. The nuggets were cold. The employees were texting and hootin and hollerin. The food came out quick... too quick so I'm guessing it's all old crap that's been sitting around for a good hour...  And the location is terrible and dirty. Will not return, but will put most most of my focus on telling people how bad this shit hole is.   Stay gold pony boy- not you Wendy's...die slowly"}
{"text":"Sub-par service.  SO, I saw the people who ordered after me getting their food. ?? They eventually called my number and said \"Did u get ur food get?\" I said no. And they said \"Ah shoot, we forgot about you!\" They also ran out of drinks at the soda machine and were out of sauces ....... Never Again Will I Be Supplying Them With My Patronage! ? Every day we stray further from God's light and this Wendy's is the living embodiment of that sentiment."}
{"text":"As the only Wendy's restaurant in the Church & Wellesley area of Toronto, this location which is built into the Marriott Courtyard Hotel by Yonge and Alexander Streets offers the traditional fare found throughout the chain. Pluses include a newly renovated look, a self-serve beverage machine offering over 100 choices of beverages as well as ice and their late hours. Minuses are the average wait time to place your order (on my recent visit it took 10 minutes before I placed my order and there was only one person in front of me). Great chicken wraps and sandwiches including their new pretzel bun chicken sandwiches are far better than McDonald's."}
{"text":"Arrived at 920ish pm with no line in the drive thru and the inside dining area is empty.  The person on the speaker ask me to hold for a minute but it took a lil longer than a few minutes.  Our order was simple yet the wait was extremely long.  It's not the 1st time that we've had to wait until 10 minutes plus for one meal combination.  Food is good, services brings it all down to a 2 star."}
{"text":"I decided to try this Wendy's again after multiple wrong orders. I waited in the drive through for 15mins at around 9pm for food. I was waiting by the first window and I can see multiple employees walking to the back corner as there's only 2 cars in front of me. I then see that one of the employees in a red shirt is laughing hysterically and grabs this dirty hose with plastic gloves on and walks back to then front laughing with her gloves. I had to pull out of line seeing something so unsanitary. Management had really declined at this location."}
{"text":"Food is always cold. It's like you guys don't give two shits about drive thru customers. And what is up with these little ass onions?"}
{"text":"For fast food workers to constantly complain about better pay, they sure cant seem to get it right when it comes to orders. Overtime I go its always something. If I tell you a hamburger, why do I get a cheeseburger with my order? Another occurrence, if I only order a kids meal, paid for my order why am I sitting at the drive thru pick up window for 15 min? Always less than stellar service, so instead of going through the line I have learned to go inside and check my order before I leave. Not even \"fast food\"."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Wendy's at least a hundred times,  but a certain employee at this location is just amazing.  Shauntee's (I believe that's how she spells it) customer service is above and beyond what I ever expect from a fast food chain. I usually receive decent service, however I don't really expect much. Shauntee is an asset to this company. I will continue to frequent this store as long as she is there."}
{"text":"This place is so unprofessional. We asked for condiments for our 30$ order they gave us condiments that was leaking out in our hands .Don't go here they should be shut down for how they treated us after asking for sauce."}
{"text":"The young lady at the front was very nice. She went above and beyond, the best personality. She provided excellent customer service. The food was great. It was cooked well and out to our table very quick."}
{"text":"Have to agree other reviewers, typical Wendy's food but every time we visit the service is extremely slow. We like the food at Wendy's but regret every time we decide to go there because of the service. When we finally got through the drive-thru and got our food home our Taco Salads were missing the chili-on both of them! Believe a change in management is badly needed."}
{"text":"Went to lunch at this location with a couple of my coworkers. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Ordering was quick and the cashier was super friendly and funny. Her coworkers behind the counter were very friendly too. They did a lot of team work to get orders out promptly. The manager came out to the dinning area to make sure everything was okay. And the cashier came out to clear tables when she wasn't busy.  The only thing weird about this location is the women's restroom... there are no doors to the stalls!? I found that kind of odd. You can lock the main door so no one can walk in on you but yeah."}
{"text":"I have never in my life returned food to a fast food restaurant, except this Wendy's. Twice now. The food is horrible. Cold. Obviously had been sitting for hours. I will not be returning here ever again."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and ordered 3 jr bacon cheeseburgers, chicken sandwich and 2 fries. The food was cold. And my uncle only lives 2 blocks away. Unreal!!!!"}
{"text":"Love Wendy's... this location is the worst... 10p on a Friday got lukewarm soggy fries... super greasy burger (likely staged and sitting in grease for awhile before it was served) ... and the manager bagged he order! So he knew it crap! Add to that the general surliness of the drive through cashier... JUST AVOID this location! These people obviously don't care!"}
{"text":"The drive thru is so tight , the curb will scratch your wheels unless you happen to be driving a European compact car."}
{"text":"This is not the first time I've encountered this at a Wendy's. I actually stopped going to Wendy's for the longest time from other locations because a few times attendants had psoriosis, or bug bites or something visible while handing out my food, so today after a long while i went past my apprehension to sadly re-encounter it here again. So all i have to say is, C'mon Wendy's!! Give me a break! I don't have any reason to be back, and that's sad. Because they're conveniently located for me. Not even for the food...The burger tasted like the salt was thrown right after cooked. I got a nearly $8 burger that had soggy buns and soggy bacon. Waste of money... And I hate wasting money."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is subpar. They only have one register able to take anything other than exact change or card. Not only that but the service is extremely slow. I'm not even sure that they are going to get my order right or not. Not a good start to my visit."}
{"text":"The service was so so so slow.  The cashier was friendly and helpful though.  Tried the pretzel bun cheeseburger.  Was so delicious!  Found out that you can order a pretzel bun on any sandwich for an additional 30 cents.  The frosty is good also!"}
{"text":"I love this location.  The frilled Chen wrap is always tasty and the fries freshly made. They have the food ready even before I can pull out my payment.  Thank you Corey for your prompt,  efficient service."}
{"text":"First of all, walked in, floor is completely wet with no floor signs. Stupid cashier got our order wrong aside from spilling my drink all over the counter. Stay away from here. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This wendy's is terrible. I grew up going to Wendy's but recently the whole chain has become disgusting. This one is just a slow, disgusting chain. Blah, rather eat pretty much any where else."}
{"text":"The staff was rude, rushed me while ordering In Drive thru and then asked \"is your order right on the screen?\" Then changed it to a picture so I couldn't review it and I said \"I'm not sure, the screen changed to a picture\" she replied with \"k go ahead and pull forward\" totally disregarding my comment and rushing me. Once I got to the window the cashier did not say hello just said \"9.08\" so I-gave her my card and she ran it and handed it back without saying one word then handed me my bags. Very poor customer service!  oh and I wasn't given a receipt!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we keep coming back to this Wendy's location. Every single time we order from the drive thru they screw up our order. At first we gave them the benefit of the doubt thinking it was just a mistake, hey mistakes happen. But no every single time they either leave something out that we paid for or we get the incorrect order. Clearly this is not just a coincidence if you read these other reviews. At this point the only reason we go back to this particular location is to see if they can get our order right."}
{"text":"Understaffed, excruciatingly slow service, dirty. Was stood in line for 15 minutes. 1 person working the drive through and front register. Orders being messed up in the drive through result into slower service inside because of customers coming back into complain about receiving wrong items. Also, the restaurant is not well kept. Dining room looks like it's never swept, both times I visited this was the case."}
{"text":"I usually really like this place. Usually always cold burgers though, needs reheating. Ordered the other night after work late around 12 midnight. Got two tiny pieces of bacon on top. It was pathetic. Too bad I didn't realize till I got home. Attached picture."}
{"text":"Got a Frosty from this location since I am recovering from a recent wisdom tooth extraction. I have enjoyed Frosty's from several different Wendy's and they never disappoint!! This one helped reduce swelling in my mouth. On the back of the receipt I got, you can take a survey on your most recent experience and if you do, you get a free sandwich! Maybe I'll try it out when I'm fully recovered."}
{"text":"If I could rate this lower then a 1 I could. They're dumb asses can't get an order right."}
{"text":"Ok, there are quite a few Wendy's in the city but in my opinion this is one of the best.  They are always fast and efficient and the management seems to really have it down to a science.  As far as the food goes, it is always fresh and hot....sometimes at fast food places the fries can be lukewarm, but I have not found that here.  The dining room is always kept clean, and there is lots of parking on both sides of the building.  If you like Wendys and are in the area check this one out."}
{"text":"Again, I ordered no cheese, mustard only.  So, this time I got double cheese no mustard.  I was in the outside lane, the inside lane, three cars to one on the outside.  No wonder the order was wrong.  Unfortunately, start giving reading and comprehension tests and maybe a personality test, why double cheese?  can't eat the horrible cheese. I call, they say sorry, we will put your name down for the next time.  Heavens, I have been going here so long I probably have at least  two months of burgers for their errors.  But they are close to my home."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is ok.  My wife and I eat here occasionally and have no complaints.  I don't like to have to request the server to refill my drink rather than do it myself, but I think that's all Wendy's.  It's usually pretty clean."}
{"text":"Not exactly what I expected from a Wendy's in the airport, I ordered a double burger combo and was perfect as expected for a quick snack but what I did not expect was the condiments that I needed to make this a great meal. They did not have napkins, ketchup, mustard, pepper and salt packets. They did have a straw for the drink."}
{"text":"If any place can screw up an order it is here at this Wendy's.  They get it so wrong, so consistently that people laugh when they pick up their tray.  I was there last evening and ordered two junior double hamburgers.  Not cheese burgers, but hamburgers, double junior hamburgers.  I got two regular hamburgers.  Try it as a game.  Go with a group, order things not exactly as the wall-posted menu, but close.  That require the person to listen.  See what you get.  I noticed Fred's terrifically helpful and detailed first review.  Way to go Fred, and to do it in five words without punctuation.  Anything for a first, eh?  Attitude varies, esp when the shift brings in people who really don't want to work.  There really is an attitude problem and I never see anyone that appears to be a manager.  Suggest that Wendy's bring in other than the franchisee to let's say, clean house and get some customer service going beyond order-taking.  This Wendy's leads the list of bad examples."}
{"text":"This my favorite Wendy\"s. I never had any problems with this Wendy's. They always got my order righ"}
{"text":"I get it, it's Wendy's. I don't expect too service from a fast food restaurant. But, every time my self or my employees visit this location there's a mistake. This time our order was wrong. The tortillas for the wraps are hard (old) and we found a hair in our food which of course is disgusting. The Wendy's on deer valley is far better then this location. Make the extra 2 mile drive."}
{"text":"What a shit hole. I lakes in and went in to wash my hands. The urinal was overflowing on the floor. Someone had puked in the sink and left it, and there were no paper towels. I don't know about anyone else but I'm not eating there!"}
{"text":"Ketchup only is really not a hard concept.  Thanks for stealing my money and ruining my meal."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch almost every morning. The sign says they open at 10. I wait in the drive thru knowing someone's there at 10am I see them walking back and forth and they don't even come on the speaker to say \"I'm sorry but we aren't ready yet\" nothing. I wait for  Someone to come on so o can order and nothing. We drove to the window and waited some more. This has happened multiple times with today being the one why I write this. I just think if you open at 10 than open at 10. Don't just watch your customers sit there in the drive they"}
{"text":"Bathrooms are disgusting. My feet stuck to the floor in the women's reat room. My husband says he has seen few gas station bathrooms that were worse. That's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Poor experience with not receiving what was ordered and waiting so long for the wrong order.  Then to being questioned from the unfriendly manager Stephanie as-to why four sauces were requested when we only ordered 1 order of nuggets. We then explained they were for the other 5 burgers ordered and asked if she wanted us to pay for the extra sauces. She turned her back and walked away. The bacon cheese burger off the value menu is a good deal for the price and the lettuce is crisp and fresh with melted cheese on a hot patty."}
{"text":"I don't know why such bad reviews. The bathroom was cleaner than any Wendy's I have been in. The restaurant was tidy and clean and Monique at the register was nice and helped me decide on the right type of chicken sandwich. She had a great knowledge of the menu and was so nice and helpful. Monique made my trip here very pleasant. UPDATE: that was the best chicken sandwich I've ever had in a fast food joint, or maybe anywhere. So moist! Gorgon Ramsey would be proud."}
{"text":"Don't really care but was a little bit hungry late, came here to get some value pic meals and shout out to who ever made the spicy chicken wrap I just had. Loaded it with cheese and hit the spot!"}
{"text":"5 stars just because of the Salad  The Apple Pecan Chicken Salad!!!!   Mixed Greens Pomegranette Vinagrette Cranberries Grilled Chcken Apple Blue Cheese   I asked for 3 bags of Roasted Pecans LOL  I love pecans  A crazy infusion in your mouth...  Blue cheese + the tart of apples, the sweets of cranberries and pomegranette vinagrette and cruchiness of Pecans :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was the only Wendy's next to me, and I was craving a Baconator, so I decided to get one from here. Big mistake.  The fries were soggy and cold. The burger was dry and thrown haphazardly onto the bun. The staff was friendly, but that was really the only redeeming thing at this Wendy's."}
{"text":"Try the four for $4 menu that includes a drink, Sandwich or wrap, 4 piece chicken tenders and fries. I highly recommend the Awesome sauce."}
{"text":"Wow ... Nothing has changed at this location. Customer service is still horrible. I had the thought that a straw would be nice when they handed us our drinks, but not okay with the guy at the drive thru who said \"Wait, straws will be in the bag!\" The food was HORRIBLE! Cold soggy fries & the burger was so dry & COLD the cheese didn't even melt. WE WLL NOT GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION, IT IS AWFUL!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I've been to. Food always seems like it's been sitting awhile. Bummer since its location is near work."}
{"text":"$10 an hour can't replace competency within the fast-food industry. It wasn't once or twice... but.. third time is a charm. These people always forget items whenever I order from here. I asked the moron at the drive-thru window if everything was in the bag?.. and he just nodded his head. As soon as I looked in the bag my items weren't in there....AGAIN!  C'mon this is just ridiculous. I'm not going there anymore. I had to get out of my car and go inside to get my items. The manager was nonchalant about it."}
{"text":"I was in this area for language exchange. This Wendy's shares its store with Timmies. I usually dislike that kind of store layout for the reason that most times there are significantly more people are here for coffee and thus it's hard for Wendy's customers to find a seat. But this one is not bad: good burger and salad. Friendly and fast service. Lots of seating as well.  My pet peeve for a fast food joint is to see garbage overflowing from the garbage cabinet. This restaurant itself looked clean but unfortunately I saw the overflow here. Therefore I take one star off."}
{"text":"Wendy's cheeseburgers are probably my favorite fast-food burgers, although I have to be honest, I don't really eat their food too often. There is just something about those burgers...although they do try to mix it up and try to bring out more exciting items than the standard burger joints. Their spicy chicken sandwiches are pretty on point too.   The restaurant itself was recently remodeled so it's still fresh, it has a more modern look about it, which is also mirrored on the Tim Horton's side. Service is like all fast-food restaurants, mediocre and apathetic - but I can't really blame them, I'd get annoyed really quickly behind the line too."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent location. They have fast service and a nice staff. I love the junior bacon cheeseburger as a snack, but the double stack is my favorite. The fries are always hot and they are clean. This is a good location.  I typically go in and sit down and I will probably come to this location again."}
{"text":"Your typical Wendy's. The servers here are friendly and the restaurant is clean. My burger came perfectly assembled! Staff was a bit flustered behind the counter but I did get my meal in minutes as promised. And with a smile too :-) Awesome!"}
{"text":"All I wanted was a quick burger to take out, and I never got to even order. Sunday night at 7 PM shouldn't be peak dining time, but the drive thru line was 10 cars long. So in to the lobby I went, and waited in line inside rather than out. I waited, and waited, then waited a little more. After 5 minutes without getting closer to the register, I gave up. That was enough for me. In the end, I probably added a year to my life skipping my order anyway."}
{"text":"Ok this was a dine in experience. You are WOWed when you first walk in at the live menus but that is where it ends. The tables were dirty we had to walked around and find a clean table and the place was empty. There is carpet thoughout the place so you know what that mean stains everywhere. Orders came out incorrect and missing items, I mean there were 6 people working and they couldnt find a way to make this night work. I asked for a ranch and he had to go get a new box, not even stocked behind the counter. The food was good but not good enough to dine at this location again unless another crew was on."}
{"text":"I am giving this location 5 stars cause its been my stomping grounds for atleast 12 years now, its always very good, clean, and I have never had a bad experience here. Wendys locations are just class acts, they are always my go to burger fix. I also made this my daughters first burger when she wanted to finally try one so she could have a good experience for the first one and always have a tasty burger to judge the rest by for her life. If its good enough for my daughter, then its good enough for you :) eat up and review."}
{"text":"I used to dread going to this Wendy's. The line backed up so bad inside because Wendy's insisted on saving $7.25 an hour by only having one cash register. The line was always backed up out the door and the wait for \"fast food\" was often 10-20 minutes. The drive-thru was slightly quicker.  However, this store underwent a recent renovation. Laminate floors, wi-fi and power outlets, and TWO registers! The service is faster and friendlier; it feels more like a McAlister's than a Wendy's. The food is decent but I believe Wendy's is a step above most fast food places. I can actually order and eat my lunch now in the time it used to take me to just wait in line."}
{"text":"Super disappointed!    Burger cold am not as I ordered!!! Spoke to manager she was apologetic but offered no solution.   The. Neighborhood Wendy's I will not be back and I will Tell everyone I can they serve bad food!   Love Wendy usually Unfortunately my Wendy is shitty!!!"}
{"text":"Inexplicably slow. This location recently underwent a renovation, and it probably should have stayed closed. There's clearly a management problem. It's always short-staffed and the crew that does come to work always seems distracted or pulled in several different directions. Yes, it's a fast food job, I get it. But one of the first rule of hospitality is to pleasantly greet your customers. I've waited for ten minutes at the drive thru waiting to place my order hearing a word or speaking up myself. It's a shame, because the location is great, but it's been run into the ground."}
{"text":"This location used to be one of the best Wendy's locations. Over the last year, the restaurant has taken a continuous dive down. I've emailed the district manager, called and even mentioned issues in person, to the general manager, all with no change.    Tonight I went via drive thru, specifically asked if the Junior Bacon Cheeseburger had tomato on it (which I knew it did) and they said yes. I ordered them several times with no tomato. I ordered 2, guess what? No tomato. I know that sounds petty, but this is what you serve, yet you screw everyone in the drive thru? Soggy fries, no sauce for nuggets even though it was on the receipt, and no sour cream for the chili even though it was also ordered and on the receipt. Every time I order from the Drive Thur, I'm screwed!!!  Why? Despite numerous complaints personally and there is no change.    Since my personal emails go unanswered and change hasn't happened, maybe this review might get someone's attention.  It seems nobody cares. I give up trying."}
{"text":"Was going to gripe cause it took 15 mins to get a chicken salad when the place is almost empty.. but the chicken was fresh cooked & good. Hubbies burger was fresh made & it is still breakfast time..   Only drawback was a little brown in the iceberg lettuce. Not bad but there."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to try the waffle cone Frosty (just a cone really) but it cost $1.89 and was tiny, plus the ice cream was dripping (melting) as soon as I got it. For the price, I was expecting more, it was a rip off."}
{"text":"My be got food here once and all of it was just thrown together and cold . I thought I'd play it safe and get a frosty today since my one surgery can't eat fast food . So there was something in my frosty I almost puked and had to throw it away . Don't go to this location"}
{"text":"The staff here are horribly incompetent. 20 minute wait just to order, as cashier doesn't know how to manage influx of people. Staff in back seem disorganized, and only one person seemed to know what they were doing."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!  This Wendy's is not the place to eat if you want fast or sanitary service. I waited 25 mins inside. As I was waiting I watched the Mgr discuss with the drive thru employee about his medications while the one cashier struggled with a day or more people in line. She would take we take an order then stop & put the order together.  As I was watching the Mgr have his left hand gloved but using his right to put together sandwiches. Handling bun and meat bear-handed. He then wiped his nose with the right hand & kept preparing food. When I said something to him,  he rolled his eyes & went back to food prep. Still didn't wash his hands!!!"}
{"text":"Drove through for a burger with no pickles.  Discussed with window worker why I don't want pickles.  Paid cash.  When I got home there were pickles.  Looked for receipt -- they didn't give me one.  Called the store, busy signal for hours.  Called corporate.  They said they will have Manager call me.  I said good luck getting them on the phone.  UPDATE:  Corporate called store Manager and asked him to call me.  He apologized and offered me a free replacement meal - just ask for him by name.  Did it."}
{"text":"As far as Wendy's go, it's middle of the pack. They get the order wrong by at least a little bit 1/3 of the time. And calling it \"fast\" food is kind of comical. But, if you're in Wilkinsburg...well, this place is in Wilkinsburg also. That's about the best I can say. Oh, and everyone is generally polite here. So they've got that going for them."}
{"text":"The cashier was really nice his name is Samuel. He took my order and before he could even finish ringing me up the manager came over with my food. I noticed that she didn't have my fries on the tray. He admittedly said he made a mistake and the manager obnoxiously yells Samuel's giving away free food and that's why my numbers are off. First of all your numbers are probably off because you're focused more on being loud and pessimistic about other people's mistakes instead of acknowledging human error happens. Secondly don't correct employees in front of guest and rudely at that she has her nerves. I only gave two stars because Samuel is great and he took her little power trip like it was nothing. Then she goes on to say something about my braids. First of all girl you could never. lol anyways people like this is why they're probably having a hard time finding employees that will stay. She needs to check herself before she runs into the wrong person."}
{"text":"I wish we had a better Wendy's than this near the house. They are slow and rarely friendly."}
{"text":"Went to the this Wendy's twice in the last week & both times I got told they have no BBQ sauce it's not even a option here. How do you not have BBQ sauce for my chicken nuggets?! Ridiculous! BEWARE THIS LOCATION HAS NO BBQ SAUCE!!!"}
{"text":"Never consistent.   I was in twice this week. On my first visit I ordered a potato, chicken nuggets and a kids size frosty. I paid at the first window and when I reached the second they tried to collect money from me, when I informed her I already paid at the first window she asked if I was sure that I already paid. I wasn't OK with her implying I was lying about paying for my lunch. After all that confusion they handed me my lunch, told me to have a nice day and I drove away. One I got about 10 feet ahead I realized they never handed me my frosty but at this point it was too late. A car was already at the window and since it's lunch time the parking lot was a disaster and I wasn't going back.   My second visit was yesterday, I ordered a kids meal but it didn't have a toy inside. While this isn't a huge deal to me since it was for myself. But, if I had a kid in the back seat waiting on a toy, I'd be pretty upset.   In previous visits I'm usually missing an item 2 out of 5 times. Whether it's butter for my potato, dressing for my salad or a straw for my drink."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a yummy burger. If you follow me you know I a bit picky. Wanda took my order and she made sure it was spot on! Wanda thank you for providing excellent service!"}
{"text":"Customer service was wack they tried to hurry up and get us out the drive thru and didn't ask what size or how much we wanted. I ordered chicken strips it's supposed to be three. Wtf is that ? Where's my other chicken strips???"}
{"text":"The wait is unbelievably long each time I visit, but the staff is always friendly. The food is usually fresh but I don't know who made my food, but if you read this, handle people's order the way you would want someone to handle yours."}
{"text":"This Wendy's has the worst customer service! I go through the drive thru occasionally out of convenience but they always rush me. There is one older guy that works there who seems to be there every time I go. He rushes me when I'm ordering to the point where I never get to order everything I want. Then when I get to the window he opens the window and tells me the price, processes my payment, then practically throws my food at me. No, \"hello\" or \"have a nice day\" or any basic greetings that most places give. I feel like I am an inconvenience to the employees when I go there to help pay their check."}
{"text":"Love coming here for a quick bite, always fresh to order. Trying out a new chicken sandwich:)"}
{"text":"Dave Thomas is spinning in his grave right now. Sloppy preparation, old food, and a staff as vitriolic and rude as they come. It's one thing to hate your job, it's another to take it out on customers with passive aggressive service, slow prep and condescending meal delivery. Just quit and let this hellhole fold already."}
{"text":"This was a second chance for this location and they blew it. The people behind the counter are so rude to eachother it's ridiculous! The guy infront of me didnt receive his food so he went to ask about it, thecashier turns to someone in the back and says she needs someone to cook his food and you hear screaming from the back \" im off in 5 min\"....like wtf? That means your ON the clock start cooking! This is fast food people! Not rocket science! So FINALLY we get our food (forgot our drinks though) and everything is burnt! Like not a little char totally BLACK but by now im already home and im not going back. So i call the customer number on the reciet and they said the general manager  would get back to me to make it right! It been a week nobody has contacted me. Obviously not even corporate cares about this store and thats why its ran like a shithole!"}
{"text":"Two burgers and a salad and all they got right was the side salad. Does anybody there understand food allergies?"}
{"text":"Zero!   I go there because it's close.  The food is old, cold and it's rare to receive the correct food. When you bring it to their attention they get an attitude as if it's your fault they screwed up. Never again"}
{"text":"If I could leave less than 1 star I would have. The cashier asked the manager to break $100. She came over took one glove off and with the hand that still had a glove on she made change and handed it to the cashier.  I watched in disbelief as she got another glove on and put it on the hand she hasn't uses.  Couldn't stomach it."}
{"text":"This place continues to be a disaster. Last week we attempted to go through the drive-thru and although there was only 2 cars in front, we waited, and waited, and waited and finally left and went somewhere else. When we drive back by after getting our food down the street the same 2 cars were still waiting in line. Then just today we drove up to order at the drive-thru and a woman told us we had to come inside to order. The few times I've been here my order has never, ever been right either. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"Twice the price for half the quality. Cold fries, poor burger execution. Bad experience."}
{"text":"This is the worst wendys I have ever been to.  The wait times are through the roof. It isn't fast food - it's just old, cold, incorrectly made food.  Do yourself a favor and go to the McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"The staff is way nicer then from a year ago, but as my husband and I got the same sandwich, we could obviously tell that one sandwich was fresh and the other old. Now that the staff is updated to friendly from weird and creepy, now you have to update their service. The crew was friendly, but then they forgot our drinks, then gave us an old chicken sandwich, expired salad, and only one of four people smiled. I would be willing to go back, but if the food isn't fresh, don't serve it."}
{"text":"Alright, I know it is a fast food restaurant (supposedly), but I just had to capture my recent experience.  Now, having done my tour of duty under the golden arches back in college, I am WELL aware of what to expect when pulling through a fast food drive through (I refuse to use \"thru\").  Apparently, they were running low on wrappers and such, because I was cut off by another vehicle heading to the pick-up window where the driver handed out a trash bag of stuff.  I had a pretty basic order.  A plain spicy chicken combo with a Pepsi.  All you have to do is slap a piece of spicy chicken on a bun, wrap it up, and put it in a bag with some fries.  No complicated sauce combinations, no trying to read my mind on the amount of a certain ingredient, just chicken and bun.  When I got to the window and the young lady asked me to pull up because my chicken sandwich was not ready, I was understanding.  I am not always pateince, but I am understanding.  I fended off one panhandler that actually walked out of the restaurant with a spool of CDs that he was selling while waiting.  Then another customer after me pulled in front of me to go inside and fix a misgiven order.  I waited.  While waiting I saw a phone number on the door for customer service.  I started my phone call after waiting five minutes and finished it after waiting ten minutes.  After hanging up, I pulled the emergency brake and went inside to get my sandwich.  There was ONE customer in the place and two girls standing at the counter jabbering with and employee who was making them free ice cream sundaes.  One of the girls must have been an off duty Wendy's employee as she had the audacity to ask if I had a receipt for my purchase.    I was offered a shot glass sized Frosty for my trouble.  Thanks, but no thanks..."}
{"text":"If I could give a half star I would. Horrible place for families. Rude staff. Screw up your order and then rude you when you call him on it. Try to cheat you. And God for bid you pull out a coupon. Just Say No To This Wendy's. Instead of remodeling the building they should've remodeled their staff. Horrible management. Those poor employees."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken sandwich is the bomb! I take off the bottom portion of the sandwich to limit the bread and eat it with the lettuce tomato and chicken with one slice of bread, the slice with the condiments on it. The new redesign of the wendys is cool too with a tv that has espn on it for the guys who want to watch the game and a couch area for the girls to relax and have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I feel like Wendy's is the gold star winner of fast food restaurants. This location is no exception. The burgers have always been hot and greasy and the chicken is always crispy. Haven't had one item missed on an order and for a fast food place that is a record. I lover the frostys with fries. Weird combo but I love it. I do wish they didn't salt there fries so much but you can always ask for unsalted fries. I have to say my burger craving was satisfied."}
{"text":"Nice and clean, looks new inside.  Friendly staff!  I'll be be more often for My lunch breaks!"}
{"text":"This location is the newest style. They have comfy chairs to sit by next to the fire place, what looks like fresh baked cookies, TVs and a digital menu. I must give Wendy's kudos for this new design.   We stopped in yesterday for a quick bite. Everything came out exactly as ordered and the staff was super friendly. My only suggestion would be trying to upsell cookies at the register. My bf would have definitely purchased one, but didn't think of it until after we paid."}
{"text":"THE most GHETTO ran Wendy's I have ever been to. I have never been more grossed out by eating in my life than I did when I ate here. The staff is GHETTO and RUDE and the food was HORRIBLE. It was cold and old food. I feel like I may get food poisoning after the few bites I ate of my chicken sandwich. I was going to complain, but then I looked at the staff working and thought, what's the point?! I knew how that would have ended. Ghetto staff means lack of caring! Stay away from this Wendy's, save yourself the stomach ache and head ache!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bunch of food in the drive-thru. Had a BOGO coupon for any Large Chicken sandwich. The code wouldn't work at the register so the cashier called over a guy, I'm assuming was a supervisor or manager, and he proceeded to tell me the coupon wasn't good on the chicken sandwiches I ordered, although the coupon said valid on ANY Large Chicken sandwich. So instead of honoring the coupon which they falsely advertised, he refused to honor it. I said forget about my order and drove off! Can't believe they lost a sale over a coupon! And it's not like I was trying to get something from them! The coupon clearly stated what it was good for!!! Now I know why I rarely go to Wendy's!! Horrible customer service! I'll stick to In-N-Out where they have great food and exceptional customer service!!"}
{"text":"Loving their apple pecan salad and strawberry tea, drive thru is always quick with accuracy. Be careful going thru at night it's very dark."}
{"text":"This Wendy's needs to get with the program. It was a pig sty inside on a Thursday afternoon around 2pm. The place was quiet. I don't see how this place hasn't been remodeled as it appears to be the original store which looks like it's form 1990.   I think that most of the Wendy's Stores out there are going downhill."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast one morning inside.  I was first in line, ordered a simple combo breakfast meal....and boy, I'm glad I brought a book.  It took them 20 minutes, and they still didn't have my food out.  I demanded a refund, and the manager didn't even say sorry or offer an incentive to wait while she brought out my food.  The girl behind me had immediately ordered an iced coffee and hash browns....and still, after 20 minutes, she didn't even have her order.  I'm usually mildly impressed with Wendy's service (could be better, but better than most), but this time they absolutely flopped.  It also took corporate over a week to contact me after I'd submitted multiple complaints, and even after they contacted me, I felt equally disappointed."}
{"text":"Really bad experience! I went through the drive-through yesterday and handed the girl (who lost the ability to smile or say thank you) my debit card for a dried out hamburger (usually not the case) and didn't notice she didn't give me the card back. When I discovered I left it there, and employee told me they had a stack of them with their new POS system. Actually, he was very nice.  I drove there the next day 5/20/18, 25 miles each way, asked for the card and was greeted with yet another sour face and not a word. The manager happened to be standing there and I told her this was a 50 mile round-trip for me and didn't appreciate having to do this. She stared at me blankly without a word. Might need some customer service refresher courses. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the workers the cashier was very friendly and nice   But the food was HORRIBLE smh I took two bites of my burger and remembered why I didn't eat Wendy's anymore my burger was cold and had a gross texture idk what it was but it was disgusting   I will not being going back to Wendy's smh"}
{"text":"Worst customer service especially in the drive through.  RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!!!! They cut you off when placing your order, they roll their eyes, never once say thank you, not a smile, nothing.  A particular employee, I won't name any names but it rhymes with Mandy loves talking about her personal business at the drive-through not paying attention to the customers in the vehicles at all this is not the first incident, it has happened multiple times, mind you I live in the area so I have frequented this particular location several times in the past two years and it has never changed, I'm DONE, will never go back again! After reading all the other reviews basically stating how food was missing, wrong orders, etc., well that's because they are too busy running theirs mouths amongst themselves and not paying attention to what they're doing."}
{"text":"I just wanted to give a shout out to the young man named Timothy who went above and beyond for me and my large families order he was so nice and made sure that I had everything I ordered I came through the drive thru at 11:20 pm on 8/19/2016"}
{"text":"The reason I gave such a low rating to this store was solely due to the price, almost 6 dollars for a burger worth maybe 3. These burgers were incredibly puny, for 6 dollars, i dont think so. Wont be going back until either their burgers get a lot bigger or their prices come down."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever. Staff is all completely rude, always mess up my order and I have sat in the drive through no less than 15 minutes EVERY visit."}
{"text":"As many may know , they have renovated the whole location. They put new tables, chairs, couches, and a fire place which is frankly useless. However, what they didn't renovate is their employees. I ordered a kids meal because I'm so broke but they didn't give me the cup for my drink. So I asked the lady that ran the cash and all I got was shitty attitude and a scowl. They need to be regenerated, trained or some shit cause I don't take that kind of attitude. All I wanted was my cup that I paid for with my hard earned money."}
{"text":"So, apparently I'm the Duke of this Wendy's (don't judge me). About once a week I crave the Fire Roasted Breakfast Burrito. It's got a wheat tortilla, eggs, Applewood smoked bacon, salsa...and other deliciousness. If my addiction makes me the Duke, then so be it (I said don't judge me...those burritos are good!).  I don't really eat at Wendy's at any other time of the day, but the morning staff seem pleasant enough. And the place is clean. This is a solid Wendy's location as far as I can tell."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru in the world. !!! I have been here for 10 minutes already. I evan had tine to login and write this review!!!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and it ok and to top it off you go through the drive-through you don't even get hello how are you or any kind of greetings whatsoever they all look pissed like where an inconvenience for them when we're paying there fucking salary by purchasing Wendy's food"}
{"text":"This is easily the fastest Wendy's I have ever been to. No matter what I order (burgers, fries, salad, etc.), the food is always ready within thirty seconds, even if I make additions to my burger. I'm not sure if they preassemble their popular burgers or if the people in the kitchen are robots, but the food is always warm, if not hot.   Two things I don't like about this Wendy's:   1. You can't order a chocolate Frosty. It's the best thing Wendy's has to offer, and this location doesn't sell it. They only have vanilla. Really, who buys a vanilla Frosty!? Well, at least they can make soft drink floats.   2. I have never seen any of the employees smile, laugh or make any minimal effort to pretend to enjoy their work. They barely even talk to each other. You'd think in four years of eating here, I'd see some hint of emotion coming from the employees, but nope. The three managers (Indian guy, Filipino guy and Chinese lady) are the only ones who take orders and I have never heard a \"thank you\" come out of any of their mouths. It's very unlike any other Wendy's I've been to, where the employees are usually pretty friendly. Oh well, as long as they get my order right, I can't complain too much about the standoffish service."}
{"text":"This location is good for quick lunch,  I have driven through and eaten in and never waited long at all.   I have only been here during lunch tho.   Not very easy to get to if you are going away from the 101 but going towards it could not be easier to pull in and out of the parking lot"}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if I could but I'm forced to leave one in order to write a review. This place is HORRIBLE! For the past couple nights for like a month I been coming here since I work near by. They kill the Wendy's experience completely at night. Never been HERE in the day time but other Wendy's make you feel better than this and the fries taste like they are cooked in fat and not grease like taste so bad I had to turn back around and return it after letting them get away twice. Please fix this because we wait in line like it's only 3 ppl working in there and I've pulled off about 5 times in 1 month. That's bad, avoid at all cost because this ain't FAST FOOD it's sad. Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"This location has the most incompetent \"workers\"! Who forgets the salad dressing for the apple pecan salad? THEY DO! Again, thru the drive thru."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give negative stars for this place. I have been to this place a few times, and literally every time, there is a problem.  1st time I went through the drive through for an iced coffee, and the gave me the wrong size, and it was hot. I went inside to get it fixed, and they forgot about me. I waited 20 minutes and they tried to charge me again. I told them thag I was just getting it fixed and she rolled her eyes and gor the manager...really?  2nd time I went theough the drive through again. It was really slow. I finally got my food and when I got to school, I realized they gave me someone else's food.  3rd time was today. I asked for a jr cheesburger no onions and no bun. They gave me my burger without cheese and with onions. I took it back and asked for them to fix it. They were annoued, took my food, took off the onions, and threw some cheese on it. They didn't  apologize or anything. The cheese wasn't even melted, and I hate the taste of onions. They seriously make me sick. I asked them if they could remake it with the cheese melted, and they got mad. I didn't think that I was asking for a lot here. I was nice about it. I didn't yell, or get angry, or ask for a manager. They have no idea what customer service is whatsoever.   There is a McDonald's and Burger King across the street!  Stay away from this place and go there!"}
{"text":"Visiting the drive thru, the gentleman working in the drive did not give my debit card back and I did not think to ask for it either. I realize I left my debit card at Wendy's the next morning and called the store to confirm they had it. They did not because the employee decided to not turn in my card and go on a spending spree buying liquor and 350 dollars worth of shoes at Finish Line.  Oh, the chicken nuggets in my 4 for 4 were pretty bland too.  #CanIRankNegativeStars"}
{"text":"Got to the location 15 minutes before they closed. When we ordered, we were told that they closed in ten minutes, but that we wouldn't be rushed. Great - we shouldn't be rushed because we did get there before close. After sitting down with our food, once closing time came, the long haired bearded man who apparently may have been the manager said: \"Just so you know guys, we're closed. You have about five minutes to wrap it up. Thank you kindly.\" Seriously? You guys will still be serving food through the drive through for two more hours, and you can't even wait for us to finish our meal? We felt rushed and not valued as customers. On top of that, the chili was cold, and the bacon on my burger was undercooked. Being a Wendy's fan, this has been my most undesirable experience yet. Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Usually this place is okay... but it depends on the day you go or the time of day you go... I am convinced, and have been for some time now-- that Wendys has food sitting around for awhile before you order it, considering how fast they get it out the window. I have had some very dry grilled chicken sandwiches. Usually the '4 for $4' has been okay and a decent value. However, this last time, after a bad experience with another fast food \"restaurant\" we came to get a Jr Bacon Cheeseburger at Wendys and the burger was cold and the top bun was literally soggy, wet, and wrinkly... and the bottom of the bun didn't fare much better. Who knows how long it had been sitting there? Too much variance with Wendys, staff quality/personality varies, food varies, and overall today I am just fed up with fast food in general. I don't understand what is so difficult about putting together a cheeseburger??  And also why is it so troublesome to not feed people food that has been sitting out for hours? Would the people serving this eat it or the people running these pathetic franchises?? If the answer is 'no' - throw it out and make it fresh!! Or at the very least maybe not leave it out that extra hour..."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly employees.  Paris is very sweet and always helpful and always has a smile on her face. I eat lunch there a couple times a week.  The best Wendy's!!!"}
{"text":"So I just left the drive through, the lady taking my order can't hear or listen, then she started yelling in the intercom like some crazy person with no morals, or customer service. Don't go here! Then the non having customer service bimbo, acted as if I was ignorant, were do you get these people from? You got one job, and you mucked it up!!"}
{"text":"Every now and then I get a hankering for one for those original Wendys' thick and juicy, fall-off-the-bun burgers, then I try one and realize that they no longer exist, gone the way of the wooly mamooth and the dodo bird. This location is especially sad. What a shame!"}
{"text":"I used to think of Wendy's as the best fast food restaurant. $15 for 3 spicy chicken sandwiches is not fast food. Wendy's upped their prices or something because $4.69 for a sandwich that doesn't meet the quality Wendy's promises. Come on Wendy's... make your sandwiches meet your fries and shakes."}
{"text":"I may come to this Wendy's late at night but they've always been my favorite, sweet service and even though i denied it, free food because they ran out of chili. I honestly love this Wendy's!"}
{"text":"I eat breakfast here at least once a week, and they mess my order up at least once a week. It gets old to have your hot coffee so cold that you can drink it like a soda, no bacon on a bacon sandwich, items completely missing or incorrect items given. If there were a Wendy's closer, this one would be out of business. The staff here should be retrained or fired, but judging by the fact that the manager is the one working the drive thru every morning messing up the orders, perhaps its the later."}
{"text":"They have upgraded some of their operations it's a nice change. Staff is decent and my current visit the food was good and when we had an issue they corrected it right away."}
{"text":"This is a Wendy's and it has Wendy's food. However, the service is phenomenal. They are friendly, quick and my order is always right. It is a nice little stop when you consider that the rest of the road does not have much to offer."}
{"text":"Ordered two of the new giant junior meals. Came out to 11.02. Paid and went on my way after making sure all the items were in the bag. When I got home I realized they gave me the 4 for 4$ burger instead of the new giant junior. I know the difference because this burger I received had one patty and was pitiful. I didn't take it back because I had already driven there and back and was extremely annoyed at this point. Needless to say pay attention to your orders. I got ripped off. Paid 11 for a 8 dollar meal. Pathetic."}
{"text":"No home douche bags working doing their shirt urghhh want a. Pic if my sandwich good luck will be calling HEALTH DEPARTMENT ON THEM NEXTTTTT!!!!!@@"}
{"text":"I don't understand why I come here, I guess I continue to expect the service to get better and each time sadly disappointed. I can't not stress enough to check your bag EVERY time you go to the drive through. They always seem to forget something or your fries are upside down or cold and then when you call them and expect them to fix the mistake it's like you're bothering them. No one is making you do this job, don't like it find something else geez"}
{"text":"Out of convenience, I used to frequent this Wendy's because it's close to my work. I can probably say that this is the worse location I've been to. I went inside once to order my food and noticed that the people dining there weren't the best of people. I'll just drive thru next time, problem solved.Whenever I would pull up to the window, RIGHT as I pulled up, the voice over the intercom says \"What can I get you?\" First of all, can I get a hello at least and second, can I get a minute to look at the menu. The food had issues too. I've had a sandwich with wilted lettuce. I ordered a salad once that looked nice because the cucumbers on top were fresh. But once I dug deeper into the bowl, the lettuce was brown and old. I've ordered chicken nuggets and fries a few times and some times they were hot and other times they weren't. And don't get me started on the actual employees. Not friendly, no smiles on their face and probably a few cases of badly drawn eyebrows. Lesson learned, will not be coming back even if it's for the delicious frosty."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch with my kids. I ordered a kid's cheeseburger with ketchup, mustard and pickle only. It had mayo instead of mustard, no biggie. I took it up to the counter and exchanged it. They just set the new one on the back counter, so after waiting a few minutes I had to remind the girl what I was there for. She unwrapped the burger and handed it over. It was kind of unappealing that the worker at the register had a nose piercing. When all was said and done, the service was not too good and the food was not much better."}
{"text":"Effiecient Drive Though and Good Product  Every now and then, I'll forget something at home and will have to swing by the house at lunch time to pickup whatever I forgot.  When I do, I'll swing through the drive through at this Wendy's down the street and pick up a burger to go.  Always great service. Prompt and efficient and have never had a bad product or screwed up order.  Strongly recommend, particulary to those traveling up or down I-77. It's right at the Exit 28 exit and you're literally one or off the interstate in less than a minute."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about the dine in area but the afternoon drive through never gets orders right. I will not be back to this Wendy's. The problem is you order your food,  they repeat the order back to you and once you get to the window the order is wrong. When you tell them the order is wrong they challenge you and some workers look at you like your wrong. Ive gave this drive through numerous of chances I'm done with it. Goodluck"}
{"text":"The men's room was SUPER nasty.  The service was good...and the food was hot."}
{"text":"They're what you can expect from a Wendy's as far as taste I suppose. The problem is A. They're so unenthusiastic. They just sound bored and irritated 90% of the time. And B. They NEVER. NEVER. Give us sauce. Most of the time they remember to ask, but still NEVER remember to give it to us. -.-"}
{"text":"I tend to avoid this location during peak times. It is snail paced slow, goes the same at any other Wendy's. I've never had a problem with any order though."}
{"text":"The front-line staff is always very friendly, but the service remains painfully slow."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today because I love Wendy's! What I don't love is the customer service. Like Jesus Christ how hard is it to speak into the mic and look me in the eyes when I get up to the window. I get the whole \"fast\" thing in fast food but you can't be going so fast that you BLOOWWWWWW my order up. Seriously they handed me a bag that was nothing like my order. Probably would have gotten my order correct if you were actually listening when you asked for it."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Wendy's burgers, poutine and the spicy Ceasar salad.  For a fast food restaurant, Wendy's is up there for me due to the variety of food they offer.  However, this location is a total letdown.  It is staffed by not so smart people, that would be the nicest way to put it.  I ordered a deluxe cheeseburger on two different occasions, and when I received my order, both times they gave me a plain old hamburger.  By the time I got home, I was in no mood, both times, to drive back and exchange the wrong order.  I know they say fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  But come on, how hard is it to figure out a cheeseburger has cheese? And a deluxe cheeseburger has more than ketchup? Plus, there's a price difference between the two, I totally got gypped.  Boo to the management team here."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service.  It's a Wendy's ... my toddler loves their chicken nuggets ... get me in and out without screwing up the order and I'm good."}
{"text":"Literally the worst experience ever. You pay for two meals and get chicken nuggets on a bun instead of a chicken sandwich. Absolutely inexcusable and not funny at all. Playing with people's food and money....two things you should not mess with. When I went back for my refund the kids seemed to think it was rather funny and offered to make me a new one which I refused because I don't trust them with my food and God only knows what they're doing back there."}
{"text":"In the land of fast food, this is high class eats.  Can't beat the burgers for fast food.  The fries have gotten better. And of all things, they have the best service in the area.  The crew is a pretty stable group, a rarity.  The best bargain is small chili and sour cream and chive bake potato.  Best for being outside during winter day."}
{"text":"The guy obviously can't do his simple job forgot my dressing and tried to give me a lemonade that he forgot to give someone mean while he has a family waiting in their vehicle for him to fix their order"}
{"text":"Very yummy !! I enjoyed what i got but they kind of took a while :/ and there were barely any cars.. Like only 2 in front ( drive thru)"}
{"text":"Bad food.  Bad service.  Anf a Big bullseye on the front door prohibiting law abiding citizens from eating there, attracting every thug in the area.  Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Fast food should be fast.  Hence the name.  Waiting 25 minutes for a chicken sandwich is one thing, but when everyone in line is waiting on their orders just as long, you have to ask \"what are they even doing?\"   I cant tell if it's lack of training, or just lack of effort but they got an extra star because the spicy chicken sammich is so good"}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't review a fast food place but I have to say, this Wendy's is a step above. I am unsure of the manager's name (blond hair) but he is always smiling, always professional and courteous and it trickles down to the staff. We have one or two Wendy's closer to our home or on our way home from work but we go out of our way to go to this location. They have the awesome Coca Cola machine that offers caffeine free Diet Coke...a BIG selling point for me, the restaurant is always clean inside and out...It is so nice to see such pride with the management and employees. Way to go everyone!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was very good. I had 3 special orders and all 3 were made as I requested. The girl taking my order before baging made sure that the cook made them as I requested. All good was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Pretty nice renovations lately. For the most part the staff is nice, speed is pretty good and they don't finesse you with only filling part of the fries. Willing to give BBQ sauce. Overall never a bad choice."}
{"text":"The food was good, but we won't come here again because they don't make the restrooms available.  The men's restroom was out of service and a person was occupying the ladies' restroom for over an hour.  Another customer told us he'd been in the restaurant for over an hour and told us that no one has been able to use the ladies' restroom (one person at a time restroom).  We were on a road trip and not having restrooms available is not acceptable.  Quite a few women asked to use the bathroom and an employee went and knocked on the door and said, \"Yes, someone's in there.\" We all knew that!  Another customer said the person in there was probably doing drugs in there.  Never coming to this Wendy's again."}
{"text":"Went here because it's close to the fwy.  The food was good, but the service is severely lacking.  First of all the restrooms only accommodate one person.  The men's restroom was out of order and women's was occupied by one person for over an hour.  Another customer told us he'd been here for over an hour and no restroom was available.  Three other customers wanted to use the bathroom, too   An employee was told that someone was occupying the bathroom for over an hour.  All the employee did was knock on the door and as four customers watched she announced, \"Oh, someone's still in there.\". This Wendy's should have a combo to access and have more than one accommodated for the restroom.  Another customer said the person was probably doing drugs in there.  Never coming to this Wendy's again."}
{"text":"Horrible! Customer service was crap, they repeatedly messed up my order and then to top it off when I finally ate it, it tasted like rancid oil. Threw it all away, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I need to find out how to get a re-print of my original receipt for business purposes. This is on my business card and need to show proof to corporate, but this Wendy's have been refusing to give me a re-print. They keep giving me the run around and finally i called their customer care and she doesn't see why there is an issue. So I need to speak with whoever the District Manager is because their manager at this location said they need \"corporate's\" permission to print this out. Thank you"}
{"text":"This Wendy's has excellent customer service. I like that they sound genuinely pleasant, and kind while taking your order, when I full well know working in the DT can be serious hell some times. Props to you all. Good job managers! Tell those DT girls they're doing great for me!"}
{"text":"Well the new pretzel burger is decent. Service was ok-you can only get so much enthusiasm out of minimal wage workers, lol. Food wise, everything is way to salty for me. Its like licking a salt lick, I know the cows back home would love the extra flavor of this place! Fries where way to salty for me & you can taste it in the burger. Its been a decade since I visited a Wendy's & if my Bf doesn't sucker me into another trip I'm sure I can go another decade & not bat an eye."}
{"text":"Tried to order via drive through but every time we spoke, the order taker talked over us with sarcastic & nonsense words. We finally gave up and got out of line. As we drove by, the order taker leaned out the window, yelled at us, and flipped us off. What a lack of class! Our young daughter witnessed this too. The service here has always been slow and the employee turnover is high, but we've never been treated rudely like this."}
{"text":"Just like all other Wendy's: a slightly more healthy choice than many other fast food chains. Good salad."}
{"text":"Felice was very nice and understood my order. The restaurant was clean. I love coming to this place for the spicy nuggets."}
{"text":"Very fast service at lunch time. They had a line all the way to the door and they took care of it quickly. Everyone working the registers and grill were very professional and you could tell that they take pride in what they do."}
{"text":"It's fast food so I'm not so picky....I'm a fan of getting the $1 chili and potato mix then together for a yummy meal :-) other than that I don't really eat the burgers here."}
{"text":"Now I remember why I quit eating at Wendy's. As much money as they spend on commercials, they could put the money into training and product. It literally took 10 minutes to complete the ordering process because I couldn't understand the gal behind the counter. However, the dissapointment is the quality of food."}
{"text":"I refer to this place as the \"fancy\" Wendy's - and I'll go out of my way to go to this one if I can. I always think it's weird when people write Yelp reviews for a fast food place, but this one is special lol. Their food taste a bit fresher than the other locations and they still have spicy chicken nuggets available, which other locations don't have. Sometimes this place can have \"In-n-Out\"-esque lines, so the people of Summerlin are obviously in the know. Drive-thru line moves relatively fast.   You can trust me one this one - I think I've been to almost every Wendy's on the westside, including the one at the airport."}
{"text":"Okay, it's fast food, I wasn't expecting a five star thing at all. But the food really was the worst Wendy's I've had, it seemed really sloppily put together and not really that great tasting. Normally I love Wendy's, but this one was disappointing."}
{"text":"This Terminal 3 restaurant at Phoenix's \"International\" Sky Harbor airport is generally the only place open after 6PM. Really? Even Starbucks is closed? I'm not enitrely sure why the traffic is so slow in February as one would expect folks from the -70 degree weather to \"winter\" in AZ. Perhaps they do, and never leave.  Anyhow good service, an average meal and no seating in this Wendy's. No worries, the rest of the terminal was closed, so all of the tables at the dark burrito spot across the hall were available."}
{"text":"Like others have said, the service is hit or miss.  I like the new interior design compared to the old one.  I just wish they'd let me toast marshmallows over the fireplace in there."}
{"text":"While I love the food, and today is no different, I have never seen a group of people so lost in what they were doing. They don't have a clue what they are doing. People who ordered to go got their food on a tray. I ordered mine for here and they gave it to me in a bag. The girl taking food to people just held the receipt in the customers' faces and asked if that was their food, all while shuffling her feet across the floor like a child. The tables were all dirty, the seats were sticky, and the floors were slimy. Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the third time in a few weeks that the night shift crew has conveniently closed a few hours early due to their \"servers being down.\"  This has happened too many times for it not to be reported to upper management for the issue to get fixed--either electronically or correcting human 'error.'  Seems this crew needs to learn math skills so they could at least take cash only when this occurs.  Keep this up and your store will close so it better be worth it evening crew!"}
{"text":"Begrudgingly posting on Wendy's as there is some shame involved, but hey....11 p.m. roles around on a Sunday night, its raining, cold and not feeling like cooking anything?  The selections are minimal on where to go, it's close by?  Yeah, you turn the cheek and go for it.  Of course, not divulging to your healthy eating friends the sin you committed, except your roommate who suddenly lost all eating morality when it comes to health and jumps on the bandwagon :)    Simply put:  You better ask for ketchup with your fries.  Otherwise, you get NOTHING.  As with every drive through, check the goods.  And they don't know they difference between a couple, a few, and several crackers.  Couple = 2.  A few = 3.  Several is 4 or 5.  A bunch = anything"}
{"text":"Service is awful. Food is decent for a quick fix and they are fast. I felt like they were of the customer than i. Food was hot and I did have a specialized order and they complied... but again, rudeness at the drive thru makes me not want to go back. But I love wendys so I can't really do that until I find another one in town."}
{"text":"I would give this Wendy's 0 stars if it were possible because it is the absolute worst. I understand it's fast food but the employees should not be rude from the start when I simply try to order food. The employee asked me to just drive up to the window and was so rude about it. When we got to the window we asked to speak to the manager and the manager was also horribly rude and told us a false store number when we asked. They put no ice in our drinks and the food was very cold. When we got our food we had our window up checking the order and the manager knocked on our window and when we rolled it down she said there is a line. I was furious with how rude and careless the employees are. Will NOT return until better management comes about."}
{"text":"Omg that was the worst lunch I've ever had. The fries looked they had been cooked twice in dirty oil. The meat on the burger smelled so bad. We threw it all away. Did not go back to compliant. Will never eat their again!!!!"}
{"text":"Where's the koi pond?? Aesthetically, this place is off the charts compared to other fast food establishments. The whole building looks like a huge box crafted out of fine wood. Inside, they've got upgraded soda dispensers, new furnishings and fixtures, making it very easy to get comfortable when diving into your JBC (junior bacon cheeseburger).  There's even a couple couches to watch TV - they had a baseball game on.   The food is about the same as any other Wendy's. I've become a big fan of the Cobb and Apple Pecan Chicken Salads. Order a half size with a side of chicken nuggets and you've got a sub 500 calorie meal with surprisingly good taste and price."}
{"text":"I have to bump this up a star.  In the year since I last visited here they tore down and built anew.  With that they seem to have become speedier, friendlier and more user friendly (if I can word it that way).  I was expecting a wait when I pulled up to the drive thru and was pleasantly surprised that they were swiftly getting the orders together and people were driving away at a steady pace.  In fact from the time I ordered to the time I pulled away was less than five minutes.    The food is still your basic Wendy's fare, but does in a pinch when you are hungry and don't have time to have a sit down meal elsewhere.  With the update of the building they also updated the parking lot to make it easier for navigating."}
{"text":"In a pinch, Wendy's can do.  However, if you're in a hurry, and expect to use the drive-thru and get out, go elsewhere.  That is also a good sign, shows that the place has staying power with the constant line of people inside and outside wanting their food.  Bad thing, traffic can sometimes be snarled if there is that big of a line that it comes out onto Baum Blvd.  Quick sidenote: if you decide to use the drive-thru, be sure to have used the bathroom prior, not fun to sit there waiting when you really need to use the facilities.  It's like that long ride on the turnpike when you already passed the last rest stop for 50 miles."}
{"text":"I think I discovered their secret to slowness, and it may not shock you at all.  This place takes and fills one order at a time.  I mean for real.  I walked in and was third in line to order my food.  I wasn't paying attention at first, but when I was next in line, I saw this first person.  They literally will take ONE order and go about their motions and just fulfill that ONE order.  And they do not do it at a fast place like you would think from a FAST food restaurant.  Once the person in front of me ordered I watched as they prepared the food.  Each item being put together one at a time.  I mean it was weird.  One part of an order will be put together and put in a bag, then the next item will be started.  It felt like an eternity waiting.  All the girl said to me while I watched this was, \"I'll be right with you.\"  That was said multiple times.  Also part of the problem might be that they reserve their smiles and jovial tone for one another, not for the customer.  It was weird to see the notable change in affect when the girl came back to the register to take my order.  Went from a smile to dead on look.  No emotion when taking my order.  I'm glad you like the people you work with, but I could hear all of what you all were saying while I ate my food.    As for the food, it was typical.  Let me touch on the fries though.  These things were coated thickly in salt.  I can confirm that too.  The thing they use to put the salt on the fries looks like a funnel that salt freely falls out of.  Although this place got an update on the interior, that does not mean it is clean.  After I had my food in hand I had to scour the restaurant for a halfway decently cleaned table.  As I ate my food I noticed that the place was not busy but not a single employee came out to attend to the tables that clearly were dirty.  To boot, management was on property doing interviews but did not address anything in the restaurant.  The cleanliness problem continued outside as well.  It looked like a fast food throw down had happened.  Not only was there Wendy's garbage, but Dunkin Donuts, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC garbage everywhere.  How did that happen when three of those four are nowhere near this place?  Oi!  Never again will I attempt to eat at this place."}
{"text":"First let me say that I've never stepped foot in this location and plan on keeping it that way.  I'm not one for eating alone in a restaurant, so I usually use the drive thru.  Being on Penn Ave in the Point Breeze/Wilkinsburg it's a little tricky to get in and out of this location.  The wait at the drive thru is usually minimal, which is unheard of for drive thrus anywhere.  The staff are polite.  The food is typical for fast food burger places."}
{"text":"I went to Wendy's and my hamburger was raw!  Every time I go to this one, they mess up something on the order.  I know it's fast food but come on.  I don't even go to the other Wendy's in the area because they are so bad. There is always an army back there and some how they can't get an order right.    This Wendy's location has this women that works the register that is Russian?  (Sorry if I may be mistaken.)  This lady has to be one of the rudest fast food employees I have ever seen.  I wish I could say she is a nice lady and blah blah blah,  but I am just being honest.  I always call her the \"Hamburger Nazi!\"  She just yells at you with no smile; \"For here or to go!\"  I'm not sure if it is a cultural thing or what.  At least the burn outs in other places smile.  I get nervous every time I order.  I have to spout out the order very fast and she cuts you off.  Go see for yourself, She is there everyday!  I've even got her in the drive-thru a few times.    I wish Dave was still alive because Wendy's was so much better back in the day.  I hope I don't get this lady in trouble.  I just want to tell her to relax.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why this Wendy's is so bad!  We used to go to this Wendy's every once and while, because it's the closest one to the house.  After a while we just kept kept getting terrible food.  I understand that it's fast food and not fine dining.  You come to expect a certain quality of food in the fast food industry and when a fast food joint can't meet that benchmark, well then you have a problem.  Ultimately we just stopped going to this Wendy's.  Then they started their new menu with new meat and ect.  I hadn't had Wendy's for a while so, I actually went to the one close to my work in Henderson.  The one over on Green Valley Ranch.  I came home that day and told my wife that Wendy's tastes a lot better now!  So, she wanted to see for herself.  We went to this Wendy's and it was so bad! I just don't understand why it's so terrible.  They can't seem to get orders right and when they do it's terrible.  I got a spicy chicken and they put a ton of mayo and it was just bad!  Don't waste your time! If you want Wendy's then go to the one on Green Valley Ranch up the road. I wish they had negative starts for this particular Wendy's."}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I stepped into a fast food burger joint.  Every time I come here, whether it be midday, evening, or late night there is ALWAYS a wait in the drive thru.    Go at the right time and the person doing the drive thru intercom could be the best entertainment you get in a while.    Oh, yeah, the food isn't all that bad either, props for the \"fresh cut fries.\""}
{"text":"This particular location smells like old grease.  When I say that, I don't mean the inside, I mean  you can smell the old grease when you are on the road coming towards here.  Against my better judgment I still stopped here.  Food was what I expected to get from a Wendy's.  This location could benefit from one of those fancy updates they have going for other locations.  Staff was courtesy, but I'm not sure how they could work here when it smells like it does."}
{"text":"First thing first, I am hoping this particular location will get a makeover like others in the area.  It is in dire need for tender loving care.  The outside looks faded from the years of being in the sun and the inside just looks sterile.  One of the first things you notice when you walk in here is the odor.  That odor of old fryer grease.  Like the fryers have not been changed in months.  The odor permeated everywhere in the seating area making me wish my party and I would have gotten the food to go.  The staff here were super polite, friendly from the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out.  Something a little extraordinary when they greet you and wish you a good day on your way out."}
{"text":"I have not been to this Wendy's in the 2 1/2 years I have lived here and now I am moving out...I have no food at my house since I am moving and I got sucked into a commercial for Wendy's natural cut french fries, so I drove on over and ordered a fish sandwich, fries and a frosty. The drive-thru was quick, the staff was friendly.   This is why I am not a big fan of fast food - the commercial always looks better than the real thing. The fish sandwich was boring, the fries were to crunchy....but they get three starts for that chocolate frosty.   Probably will wait another 2 1/2 years to visit another Wendy's...."}
{"text":"I'm glad I waited to write this review, as I stopped back after my initial visit here and had a totally different experience.  My first experience went very smoothly, no hiccups to complain about (out of the ordinary that is for fast food).  But when I returned at a later date, it was a totally different experience.  On my second visit I ordered basically the same exact thing I had on my prior visit.  However, this time I remembered to tell them that I did not want ketchup on my sandwiches.  Instead I asked if mayo could be the condiment of choice.  While reading the screen, seeing my items pop up, I noticed the employee at the register had put that I wanted ketchup only on the sandwiches.  I corrected here and made sure it was mayo instead.  Now, here's where I felt defeated.  When I finally started to dig into my food, that's when the mistake was blatantly obvious.  When I told her I wanted mayo instead of ketchup, she put the order in as \"mayo only.\"  So I got the slab of beef with just mayo on it...not what I ordered.  In the future, I will just drive a few miles up the road to visit the other Wendy's and forego this one."}
{"text":"No breakfast?..really? Well that gets -2 out of the 5 stars and -2 because of the 2 times I went and got my order wrong and one time at night time they took so long to ask for my order. it looked like they were closed but no they were just chilling inside side, I had to go to the window and tell them what's up? You guys rich you guys don't need to get my order anymore? Haha I only come for the biscuit and gravy which they don't sell so bye."}
{"text":"Not too often will I review a fast food place, but I had some good service at this Wendy's tonight, well right this minute actually. Got here at 10:30pm Sunday, we wanted a couple chicken sandwiches and went through drive through. The person who took our order was nice, asked if we would like to try whatever it was that was there special they have going on. Got to the window to pay and they let us know right away it will be 6 minutes since the food will be fresh. 10 minutes later she apologizes for the delay, cook forgot to drop the spicy chicken, she gave us 2 large frostys on the House, which wasn't necessary but was very kind of them to do. Engaged in some friendly small talk. Got our food and went home. I truly appreciate good customer service, especially these days when it can  be hard to come across."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's chili and while some things are worth the wait, it is hard to categorize this location as fast food.  This is quite a convenient location and would fare better with some more attention to detail."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever!!! Slowest service--workers always have an attitude!! Been waiting in the drive thru line for 35 minutes while they do shift change and load the pop machine.   Don't waste your time. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst fast food restaurant I have ever been 2.  Ridiculous I can't tell you how many items they where out of drinks charging items and then telling the customer they where out would u like something else I swear my chicken tenders where cold I refused to return I didn't want to have the headache of a re order cleaning supplies on the counter brooms n dust pans  laying on the floor in the lobby employees just didn't seem to care I swear I'm a local I work near the strip I will never ever return to this established so sad."}
{"text":"I've ordered spicy chicken nuggets here multiple times. I'm not sure why I keep trying. They always give me regular nuggets, which I don't want. I guess it's my own fault for not checking before I drive away. If you don't have them, take them off of your menu!!"}
{"text":"Best value menu of all the fast burger joints! No extra charge for lettuce, onions, and tomato. Small up charge if you want a frosty with your combo instead of a soft drink. Best tasting burgers around. Good job Dave Thomas!"}
{"text":"This parking lot sucks. Whoever thought of having the drive thru come through the actual parking spaces needs to go back to architecture school.   My *chicken* sandwhich was extremely over cooked and wht can I never get something that looks like the advertised photo? My order always looks thrown together."}
{"text":"The food is the food and the same as other Wendy's which saves this location. The manager dropped my bag of food onto the floor. She picked up the bag, set it onto the same counter service where other people's food gets bagged and she left it there. She returned and took the bag around the corner out of view to transfer my food into a new bag, then she set the new bag onto the exact same counter spot the dirty bag was set. Then she grabbed the bottom of the bag to hold it while she filled it with the rest of my food. She then, with the now dirty hand, grabbed other items for my bag. I stopped her and called her on it to which she half-heartedly apologized, but i did not get the impression she has any comprehension of contamination or cross-contamination which in a restaurant (yes, fast-food places are still restaurants) they meed to follow industry standards regarding cleanliness and not creating or perpetuating health hazards."}
{"text":"This Wendy's location is actually just off the north side of Sunset Drive, right in front of the Galaxy Luxury Movie Theater in Henderson.   I usually end up here right before a movie to grab some tasty chicken nuggets to smuggle into the movies! It's just another chapter to my perverse and unnatural love of tasty, wonderful chicken nuggets! Wendy's aren't necessarily the best chicken nuggets in town but they are a-ok and will do in a pinch.  I've only been inside once. The place wasn't necessarily immaculate, but it wasn't terribly messy, either. We almost always hit the drive through to grab our food. The service is okay. Just okay. Honestly, it hasn't been good enough to stand out. Then again, it hasn't been terrible enough to stand out either.  That is why I am giving this location 3 stars. It is what it is. Don't come in with unrealistic expectations and you will be just fine. It's not bad at all and I will continue to come here and buy tasty, wonderful chicken nuggets to smuggle into the movies!  3 stars."}
{"text":"Alley gives this place 5 stars for being so awesome to her before and after Nanas salsa challenge.  She enjoyed their nice air condition and their clean floor.  On the hike back to the truck she opted for a rest, ice and a frosty.  She was serenaded by Pat singing Disney's Aladdin.  Everyone was super friendly and no one questioned her service dog status.  Her frosty was prepared just how she liked it, cold and vanilla!  Thanks Pat!!!"}
{"text":"Can this place get an order correct the 1st time? I think not!"}
{"text":"Somebody has to do something about this sh**.   The facility is spotless and the service was excellent and friendly BUT they have those stupid touchscreen pop dispensers so that's an automatic one star rating from me.   Seriously F those time wasters,  if I wanted to stand around waiting for somebody to get their shit together and do something that should be simple I would go find rush hour traffic to get stuck in.     F touchscreen fountains and F all the restaurants who install them."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Leave you standing at counter. Act like the only reason they are working there is because their parole officer told them they had too. Rude. Need more workers so the counter person isn't having to work drive through at same time. Bad thing is as a truck driver it's them or the dehydrated hotdogs in the store."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite fast food places for two reasons. 1) They don't bat an eyelash when I order no bun. They just ring it in and make it properly without a fuss like McDonalds or Burger King (and the product quality is better than a lot of competitors). 2) They have two of the touch-screen choose-your-own-drink machines. Nothing annoys me more than getting stuck behind someone who needs to put 35 flavors in one cup or who can't choose between cherry and lime and holds up the line for 10 minutes. Having two machines let's me use the other one to get my coke zero in a hurry. It's like having a fast-lane."}
{"text":"My experience here stared out as a 1 star because the tables where dirty I did order my order for was wrong but a nice manager named Keisha sad she was sorry and made it right please clean up your tables it looks nasty inside I just might not order next time and walk out and go to burger king at least I know the tables are clean"}
{"text":"The Wendy's menu was rather limited. I couldn't find my junior bacon cheeseburger! Also the fries that they gave me were cold and stale. I love fries but I didn't actually finish them this time.  They have seating here."}
{"text":"Within the category of fast food specifically, I give Wendy's 5.  I have lived outside the country for almost 10 years, and the ne style of Wendy's compared to what it was when I left is ultra modern and hip.  A big improvement.    The food is much better too.  The meat is fresher than most other places and seems more flavorful.  I also like the new flavor a of frosties.  I do wish that used better cheese.  I really hate that thin processed cheese, and would really enjoy some real cheese.  Also, they cook their bacon well and thoroughly.  Many other places give my stomach severe issues when I eat their bacon, but Wendy's is fine."}
{"text":"Look I get it, It's just a fast food restaurant. But this place is so dysfunctional. I asked for a meal she only rings up a sandwich. I then let her know once again that I wanted a large size meal in a calm friendly voice. She replies with and I quote \" well whats the drink then\" with major attitude. I laughed it off and pulled to the window. Hands her my card she rings me up. Hands me my drink while never looking in my direction. Then repeated the same behavior with my meal. This store needs  strong management because it's in  shambles"}
{"text":"Worst fast food I've ever been to. A couple years ago, this was a nice place. It took a long time for someone to answer the drive thru and then the guy working the drive thru was very hard to understand like he had food in his mouth and basically clueless. Once our order was finally understood, it then took a very long time to get our food. I thought we were overcharged, but rather than deal with the clueless gentleman I decided to just move on."}
{"text":"I got fries today and they were awful and I went thru the drive-thru again and asked for a fresh batch.They said it would be two minutes. I waited. I received new fries on top and the old ones at the bottom. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Two and a half stars.  It's nice to see that this Wendy's is still open.  When I lived in Greenfield, my friends and I would come here a couple of times a month.  I've always liked Wendy's better than McDonald's or Burger King--but that ain't sayin' much.   I'd always order off the value menu because I liked a baked potato and butter (instead of fries) and a side salad with my burger.    I've only been back here on rare occasion since I got married, but when I do, I still like the value menu."}
{"text":"Oh geesh!  Where to begin. The girl was on her cell phone and all I could think of was \"Gurrrrl F*** this job\". I ordered a jr bacon cheeseburger to hold me over for dinner and it took 20 min. Insane!!!!  I should've got a frosty cone and called it a day. Not to mention the woman to the side of me kept coughing without covering her mouth. ALL reasons I dislike large crowds, especially at the mall. Bunch of mongaloids work here. I shouldn't be so mean, but Christ on a cracker. At least the woman on her cell phone apologized about the long wait. Now that's GREAT customer service.  Less talky and more communication would be even better."}
{"text":"We had an exquisite evening here. The food was well prepared and very unique. The burgers were STUPENDOUS!!! What a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS WENDYS! They almost ALWAYS get my order wrong, then when I ask for the correct order they give me attitude! Awful customer service. Generally I let it slide when they mess up my order. But today when I asked for the correct thing the woman in the window said \"you didn't say plain\" with the nastiest attitude. Then the woman I think was the manager was staring at me with a dirty look. I told them this happens to me almost every time. They gave me an extremely insincere apology and closed the window. Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"This location needs a major overhaul.  In the past, we never had any issues.  Tonight was an entirely different story.  We stopped in a little after 6:30.  One person in front of us and a large group with several children behind us.  Cashier didn't really greet us and didn't seem too thrilled to be there.  A very strange vibe and not good for customer service at all.  We ordered two 4 for $4 meals, for dine-in.  Simple enough.    Then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally, when it had been a solid 15 minutes without our food, I approached the counter and was promptly ignored for a few more minutes.  Then, the large group with several kids - the people behind us in line - got their food.  Wait.  What?  We had not gotten our simple order...the person in front of us had not gotten her order...but this large family now had their food?  Unacceptable, to say the least.   I asked the cashier about our food and he literally stood there looking confused.  Our name had gone from \"In progress\" to not being on the board and he couldn't figure out where our food was for a minute.  Then he asked if it was to go.  I said - \"No, it was for dine-in.\"  Then I explained that it had nearly been 20 minutes now and the group after us already had their food.  He apologized, miraculously found our food rather quickly, and gave us larger drinks to help make up for the wait.  Very frustrating experience.    Worst customer service I've ever had at a Wendy's.  Definitely will not be back to this location unless they make some changes.  No one should have to wait over 20 minutes for \"fast food.\""}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Wendy's and they are always so friendly! I just love swinging through!!"}
{"text":"I stopped to get a fish sandwich and I was told they needed three minutes. I pulled over and waited 19 minutes. I then walked in and was confronted with mass confusion and very unorganized people. I've liked Wendy's more than most fast food but this one is not worthy of ever returning to."}
{"text":"If you need something quick and your order accurate...perhaps you should go elsewhere.  This Wendy's helps to reinforce my diet by reminding me never to frequent THIS one ever again.  I'm not against Wendy's as a whole...just the lack of caring from THIS particular one.  Perhaps it's the area...Of all the fast food on this corner...NONE of them tend to give a rats @$$ about the customer.  Oh well...thanks Wendy's for the bad service, horrible accuracy and a restaurant that smells of sewage for some odd reason because without bad fast food like you're likely to find at this location, I think my waistline would have doubled!  I like to call it my \"don't-ever-eat-at-this-restaurant-again\" diet."}
{"text":"While this is my first review of this location it isn't my first time eating here.  Wendy's is a brand name and franchises while privately owned provide the same or at least similar products.  The several times I've been here I've had to misorders, returned due to misorders and extremely subpar food across the board. Yes it's fast food, No it doesn't have to be over fried/poorly constructed/missing ingredients that were added at additional cost or belong to the order.  They're very quick to correct the mistakes! So at the very least customer service is acceptable or above par.  However, if you want lunch for cheap and fast food is what's convenient McDonald's is down the street."}
{"text":"Food: exactly what you'd expect.  Customer service: a bit slow but it's between shifts right now.  Cleanliness: mostly clean. no garbage or spills visible.  Sanitation: many, many garbage flies. on tables, on my drink, around prep areas.   Please do something about the flies."}
{"text":"This Wendy's just opened not too long ago in my area so I was really excited.  Went through the drive thru in which it took 10 minutes to get my food and when I got home the whole order was wrong.  I asked for a hamburger and they gave me a cheeseburger and the fries were not fresh.  Very disappointed.  So much for convenience.  Guess I will have to continue going to the one on Green Valley if I want Wendy's."}
{"text":"I should have looked at the reviews before coming here. It was close to the hotel so I decided to come here because it was after hours and I got in late. Service is extremely slow and I was the only one there so I'm not sure what took the employees so long to prepare my deluxe bacon burger. I think I spent a total of 15 minutes waiting for my food to be prepared. I wouldn't come back here again."}
{"text":"Went on a picnic w my kids. Picked up Wendy's and a salad for me. No fork. I guess I won't eat. ?"}
{"text":"The lady at the drive thru asked if I wanted to try the new strawberry mango salad. I said sure and it was good minus the 2 different hairs I found in it. I should ask for the ingredient list; maybe it's an ingredient? As far as I am concerned I will not return and you should stay away also. 1 hair found in your food is bad but not that bad. Finding 2 hairs in your food makes it pretty clear that this location does not follow health/ safety regulations.  Waste of $10 bucks as I could finish the salad. Very Disappointed."}
{"text":"GREAT customer service and always super quick! Food quality varies from time to time but for a quick eat this is my place!"}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't review a mainstream fast food joint but the service and food I got at this Wendy's last night was so awful I have to share.    My husband and I had a very late lunch which spilled over into a very late dinner and decided around 10:45pm that Wendy's sounded good.  We went through the drive-thru and were greeted by a female employee who, at first, seemed professional and friendly.  I was driving the car and after her greeting us and asking what we would like, I politely (and I'm especially polite at fast food restaurants out of fear of food sabotage!) asked her to give us a minute to look over the menu.  She very nicely said that was fine and instructed me to order when I was ready.  So far, so good.    No less than 30 seconds later, she got back on the speaker and curtly said, \"Are you ready yet or what?\"  I'm not sure what could possibly have happened in the half minute since she last spoke to us but her demeanor had changed drastically.  I wasn't really ready but again, in an effort not to piss off someone who's making my food in a sight unseen kitchen, I obliged and started to place our order.  She interrupted me probably 2 or 3 times while saying my order; it was just so rude.  I'm well aware that I need to indicate what size value meal I want and what kind of drink I want - no need to continually interrupt me while I'm speaking to ask me.  Wait until I'm done talking and if I haven't told you exactly what I want, then feel free to ask away.  But to interrupt me over and over again?  Hello?  Common sense and courtesy, anyone?  Both are highly lacking here.    I pulled around to the window and gave my money to a gentleman who was nice but not overly friendly.  Not a big deal.  However, when the woman who was obviously the gem on the drive thru speaker (I say obvious because she was the only one there with a headset on) came to the window, she literally handed me the bag of food, did not look me in the eye a single time and started to close the window.  Not a word was spoken.  No thank you.  No enjpy your food.  No come back again.  Nothing.  I wondered if she had suddenly become a mute.  I said thank you as she was handing me the bag and she literally kept looking over my car and out into the street. Annoyed at this point, as she closed the window I yelled out to her, \"Hello?  I said thank you!\" She looked at me with a blank stare and walked away.  Again, not a word was spoken by her.    Unfortunately, the food didn't redeem the horrible customer service.  The fries were obviously old and the tortilla on my grilled chicken wrap was so hard around the edges that I ended up just taking everything out of it and eating it like a salad (which, to be honest, wasn't that bad but I wanted a wrap, dammit!).  My husband did enjoy his burger but his fries were old, too.    Look - I get that eating at a fast food joint is hit and miss and I understand that going late at night can get even sketchier but there's just no justification for an employee acting like that and most definitely no excuse for the food to be old and hard.  If you're open until midnight or 1am, I should be able to get food that late that's as fresh as it is if I come at the dinner rush.  I'm sympathetic to fast food employees - it's a thankless job, they're not paid well and I'm quite certain that a lot of their customers (especially in this shady area of town) are real pains in the ass.    With that being said, like I mentioned before, I am NOT a pain the ass when ordering food at any restaurant establishment, and most definitely not if I'm ordering at the drive through of a fast food place.  If I'm being rude and condescending, by all means - dish it back out to me! I don't expect to be treated well if I'm not treating you well.  But if I'm nice, friendly and respectful, is it too much to ask for the same?    And now I'll close - with this being the longest Yelp review I've ever placed.  Whew!  I'm coming up for air and if you've made it all the way to the end of this, I salute you!"}
{"text":"Ok to be honest, I think this Wendy's is by far the most disgusting wendy's ever. Food is always horrible. Ordered a honestly chicken sandwich meal and an Asiago chicken sandwich meal and the chicken was so dry.. it tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. Don't eat here. You will probably get sick."}
{"text":"Ordered the JBC Meal through the drive thru Tuesday on my lunch break. I have to say I was very impressed with the service I received, and my meal.  My burger was cooked to perfection, the lettuce was crisp and the tomato was fresh. My nuggets were hot and tasty My fries were hot fresh out of the fryer cooked to perfection.   This is my second visit to this location ordering the same menu item and I can say it's been consistently good."}
{"text":"I cannot stand this specific location. Not only is management (whoever wears the red shirts, not the black ones) super super rude, but god forbid you have a question or a complaint because then you'll just be talked down to like a dog. I can just spend my money elsewhere, because this location clearly does not care about getting or maintaining business.   I will never, ever return to this location ever again."}
{"text":"How do you forget two major ingredients in a promotional sandwich? Especially when those ingredients are IN THE NAME? No bacon or mozzarella on my Bacon mozzarella sandwich and it was drowning in mayo. I guess I won't be giving this location my money any time soon."}
{"text":"DON'T EVER GO TO THIS LOCATION  Never going to this location again.. service was extremely slow when I ordered only 2 junior bacon cheese burger and chili fries.. the chili fries were terrible I looked like it was made houra ago cheese had a weird color and I literally vomited after eating it. Then their bacon for the burger was hard as a rock.. it seems as their staff doesn't know what they are doing the look completely lost and one male associate was wearing his backpack while taking orders inside and giving out The orders of the drive thru customers. I suggest don't go here your going to wait 10mins and the quality and staff is horrible.  Was going to contact their customer service but they didn't give me a receipt and to make a complaint on their website you have to have the store location number, I even tried searching it then won't show any of the store location number. Just comes to show they have terrible customer service at the store location and online.. you can see they don't want to get any complaints or feed back from us the paying customers!"}
{"text":"The level of lack of customer service is disgraceful. The employees stand around and are more interested in talking to each other than acknowledging the customers and these are not high school aged employees either, they are adults. Better to just hit the drive thru."}
{"text":"My experience was not good at all. When ordering in the drive through one of the employees mixed up my #10 for a #2. When I corrected her 2times she continued with the order. When I got to the first window I informed  another employee of the mix up and she was very nice and got the manager to fix the order. At the 2nd window I received my food from one employee, then the employee making the drinks(believed to be the one who took my original order) place my drink to the side and continued with other task. I sat for 2mins and when she noticed I was still there she rolled her eyes grabbed my drink and then slammed the window in my face as I was about to ask for condiments. This was very rude and I don't think I will be going back to this Wendy's. Even tho they were happy to fix my order the rudeness if the last employee was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Had to stop in for an extremely last minute lunch pick up and was pleasantly surprised by the hasty work by the crew. I placed my order and before I could even put away my change, my meal was ready to go."}
{"text":"The quality of my food was like awesome and the workers gave me extra ranch and didn't charge unlike some other restaurants. Thank you for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Went thru the drive through recently and asked for a jr frosty. I had one of those keychain things, but I couldn't find it. After a five minute wait before I got up to the window, I found it. So I told the cashier that I found my key tag for a free jr frosty. So she told me my total. I gave her my cash and looked at my receipt and it was still charge AND she took my frosty card. I said \"the charge is still on the receipt\" she said that next time, I need to tell her that I have any coupons when I order. I said \" okay, my bad, I didn't think I had it, but you took my card and didn't tell me I got charged anyway and if that's the case, where's the second frosty then?\" She goes \"here's your dollar and frosty\" and then closed the window. It's not the money, it's about the fact that I was treated soooo rudely!!! Never going back there!"}
{"text":"Do not go here. This location of Wendy's is the worst. I stopped by today to get a strawberry lemonade and some chicken tenders. The strawberry lemonade had very little strawberry and it and it was lukewarm because they didn't add enough ice to it. Also one of my chicken tenders was about half the size of the other two. Paying over seven dollars for just these two items I would expect them to at least be done right. So ridiculous. On top of that the lady who helped me was not friendly and never even smiled. I don't think she said thank you and she spelled some of my lemonade on my car and didn't even apologize or hand me a napkin. I am never going here again which is too bad because it's on my way home from work and I typically love the strawberry lemonade from Wendy's. This is just not a good location."}
{"text":"Slow service and could not handle special orders.  Somewhat limited parking and line for ordering blocked the front door and rest room access.  Asked for no mayo and add pickles and got no mayo and no pickles."}
{"text":"Sunday morning 8am.  No coffee ready.  No cereal bars for combos Asked for Artisan egg sandwich with sausage, counter person said \"sausage biscuit\" I said no, #2 egg sandwich.  She asked me if it read right on the screen. Screen said sausage biscuit.  Other counter person said \" he clearly said #2. \" Asked for combo with cereal bar and coffee. She did not know how to do the combo and had to get help. Other counter person starting berating her for not knowing how to ring it up, and not being able to count, not having coffee ready, and not stocking up front. 2nd person took my payment.  I was then informed that they were out of the cereal bars, did I want apple slices. I didn't, but could not bear the effort of crediting me the price difference.  Took 10 minutes for coffee, then another 10 for sandwich. I was the only customer in line, and only one person was seated.  Decided to open the apples, and they were brown, mushy, rotten.  I left."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero I would! How is it that it's busy but the fries are cold and burnt?!? Chicken nuggets seemed like they had absolutely no moisture in them, driest chicken nuggets I've ever had. Even the Coca Cola tasted funny like they don't clean out the fountain please please please do yourself a favor and go to ANY other Wendy's! Most disgusting food ever gross!"}
{"text":"You get one sauce for free with your combo, I got two combos and they wouldn't give me a second sauce, so I had to make a separate purchase of $0.30 just for a sauce that should have been free with the second combo.   Not to mention I had to repeat myself over and over just for her to still get it wrong.   Not pleased with this Wendy's at all!"}
{"text":"Slowest wendys ever dont go there in your lunch break big waste of valuable time"}
{"text":"The smell inside was so bad I had to leave.  And no one was there to take my order anyways.  It smelled so bad I couldn't have ordered so no big deal."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Wendy's ever! I went through the drive thru that barely moved. The line went all the way out to the road. I must have waited at least 30 mins from the time I got into the line till getting my food. Ridiculous. I could have sat down and ate somewhere nicer and been done by the time I got my food here."}
{"text":"Why review a Wendy's? Aren't they all the same? Well no that's not true. Plus it's Sunday morning and I'm catching up on my Yelpings.  Open til 2 am. Lots of chicken nuggets. This one seems to have faster service than most late-night fast food joints. Happy Maher. Good morning."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Wendy's in town! Always fresh and hot and the staff are friendly and quick .. I'll only come to this Wendy's ..thanks!"}
{"text":"Idk why this place was given 1 1/2 stars. What do you expect from fast food? Place was super clean and cashier was cute. Food was food. You fegs.."}
{"text":"Got food here at 10:30pm. Was greeted by James! Awesome service! Keep up the smile James!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is very slow through the drive thru after they re-opened with a new look and after I finally got my it was cold will not be going here anymore"}
{"text":"Got a bad burger and (Jennifer) who answered the phone could care less. Please ask me what was wrong with burger don't be defensive and tell me \"we always check our product/food\". No offer made to me to replace my bad ickie burger with something else. Nothing... that's bad service. I let her know I would call corporate and I filed with Maricopa County. I did tell her I like her \"nice\" attitude. She could care less, maybe this franchise doesn't give a flying . Dismissive attitude is not good customer service. I hope they look into this, as this place is going downhill despite it's location on this  part of town it used to be good. Couldn't give it a Negative Zero or I would have. I will let my co-workers at Maricopa hospital know to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Rude employees, don't carry diet coke for those who need it. I rather drive to another place than go there. I rather drive to the one down the street.."}
{"text":"Was in the area and the kids were hungry. We try not to eat at a fast food franchise, however there are a couple we will go to and Wendy's is one of them. Had three of the five kiddos with me. Don't allow any eating in the vehicle so we ate inside. I wasn't going to eat anything, however they had the BBQ pulled pork on their menu, had to try it out at least once before they are gone. Kids had chicken strips and fruit with milk. I was actually impressed with the pork sandwich, lots of flavor, and the cole slaw added some good flavor to the sandwich. Kids were good, ate everything and wanted more as usual. Service is like any other franchise, it's a catch and go. Overall it was fine, probably only time we will be there since we do not live in the area. Again is was an OK visit"}
{"text":"Nothing special, most fast food franchise are basically the same. Went through the drive through, ordered and received my order very quickly. It is true about the attitude here. Put on a smile, say hello. We don't have to come here for that. Other than that, food was good."}
{"text":"Only been here a couple of times. What do you expect from a fast food restaurant? Service is good, food is good. I like the different selection from Wendy's."}
{"text":"This was a life changing experience to be honest. The rude girl over the speaker allowed us to go to Jack in the Box for the first time. This is the only reason I gave 1 star instead of 0. Go to Jack in the Box if you are in the area and want food."}
{"text":"Sometimes the drive-through is fast, and sometimes it seems to take all day. The sanitation score is 94, that does not scream quality."}
{"text":"THE MANAGER JORGE IS A RUDE ASS!! I ordered 2 FULL SIZE  spicy chicken salads with no tomatos. He said they \"came with tomatoes so I had to get tomatoes.\" I told him I always ordered them without tomatoes and he huffed and said very rudely \"well you will just have to wait then because we have to make them special.\" I said okay then I'll wait. He said to pull up. I told him the order was wrong because he put down half size salads and he said \"just pull up!\" He was very nasty. When I went to the window I told the girl that the man took my order down wrong and to please check it. She said yes he did he wrote down half size salads instead of a full-size salad. I asked her to please change it. She changed it and told them to make them 2 full sized salad and Jorge came over to the window and said to the girl \"she said half size salads.\" The cashier said well she wants full size salads. Jorge looked out the window at me, gave me a dirty look, shook his head at me, turned around and kept shaking his head as he walked away. I asked her if I could please speak to the manager about how rude that man was, and the cashier said \"he is the manager.\" I honestly couldn't believe it! That manager is a rude, rude idiot. If I hadn't pressed the issue about no tomatoes I would have just driven away thinking that they didn't make them that way anymore and he would have lost a $17 sale. Apparently he doesn't care about making money for his company, and it is very apparant in his rude, obnoxious, nasty attitude. I really feel very sorry for his employees, because if he treats the customers like that, then he probably treats his employees worse."}
{"text":"SLOW and extremely rude.... Not worth the wait and if you hate your job so much don't work there."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the only fast food restaurant that should actually have the \"fast\" revoked from the title. This is the only Wendy's in the area, so we are forced to return even though not one experience at this location has been positive. The food is consistent with every other location, but the service is so incredibly poor.   I've come during the day on weekends, afternoons and evenings during the week and always find that there could be no possible way a manager is working.   Sometimes they are completely out of drinks-like Coke and Sprite and Dr. Pepper. How lazy do you have to be to let 3 flavors run completely out?  Tonight we came and there were the only 2 employees working the drive through lingering outside. While we didn't think it was possible, it was. Both employees took their entire break together so so the line just kept growing with no movement.   Normally I wouldn't rate a restaurant on service, but this location is so bad I felt compelled to review a Wendy's on Yelp. Technically I'm not sure fast food joints even deserve a profile, but as you see by the overall rating, I'm not alone and the world should know what they are getting into.   Save time and sit down at a decent restaurant. Or if you must, other close by \"fast\" food options close by are Which Wich, Subway, Burger King, Chipotle, Tzikis, Zoe's Kitchen and Bojangles."}
{"text":"Ok i get this is a fast food place that is run by minimum wage teenagers but this place always has a mess at the drive through. Way too long and always backed up. Management needs to pep talk these kids with work ethic or fire them all."}
{"text":"This location was out of chili, a little piece of me died after hearing this news from the very obviously apathetic employee taking my order. I resorted to ordering three of the largest burgers they had in order to coddle my broken heart, I fought damn hard to hold back the tears welling up behind my sad eyes. R.I.P chili...and my heart. -Burt Macklin"}
{"text":"This location is just \"okay\" I have been here 7-10 times in the year I lived in the area. For the most part it's been good, but you always have to say it clear what you want.   Most are teens behind the counter so it takes a bit for them to pay attention.   Aside from that it's great for your buck. I can get a good mix of food for $12 inc tax."}
{"text":"22 minute wait for a kids meal. Multiple customers left the drive thru line out of frustration. Two fellow customers in line behind me inside the dining room gave up and left as well. This is routinely the worst Wendy's that I stop at, but tonight was a new low."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I have ever been to in my life. To say they are slow is an understatement. They have a no care attitude and no regard for customer service. I would give zero stars if it were possible. Bathroom was dirty as well."}
{"text":"Well...  when you pull in a Wendy's you usually know what to expect.  Food wise this trip was no different.  I ordered a double combo with a garden salad as a side..  burger was made fresh and it surprisingly was assembled with some care.  Salad was better than expected and seemed very fresh.    Daughter ordered a chicken nugget combo with fries...  nuggets seemed fresh but the fries were horrendous.  Cold rubbery and just awful.  But the biggest issue was with the cashier Alexandria...  when taking our order she kept asking us if we were sure and suggested other items...  ???  She then informs us that she only has an hour to go in her shift and wants to stay put right there with us until she can clock out...  states she has to clean the stack of trays beside her and doesn't want to...  I look over and see a stack of 9 trays...   wiping of 9 trays is too much for this girl?   My daughter offers to clean the trays for her...  I inform daughter that she is getting paid and that's why she is here..   Alexandria states that it's kinda why she's here but not really...   what?  Daughter asks her if she likes her job...   of course her response was no..  she hated the place and the management.  She went on that it's a horrible place to work and that she despised everything about it.....  I suggested she quit and she responded with \"where else can I work and get paid for doing almost nothing?\"  She went on that she probably shouldn't be telling us that...   ya think???    The millennial workforce...  yay.   Seems management needs to pay more attention to the counter and less time sitting in the back office..."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I waited 20 minutes for chicken nuggets and a potato with no apology from the manager Landy, he needs to be fired !  Coach your staff and move faster than a sloth please...as it is fast food. And you really should  not roll your eyes at customers !  Maybe Wendy's should pay there managers more money and then you might  get better service !"}
{"text":"Ok this is a huge pet peeve of mine if you are challenged in speaking English don't work at the drive-through it really defeats the purpose of having a drive-through when you have to explain it over six times and they still don't understand"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is downright disgusting, the inside looks like 1992. The food is prepped without any care and the staff look like they could care less about you and your food. I've been here once since I moved to Middleton and that was one time too many. The restaurant seemed grungy inside, the parking lot needs to be re-sealed.   Sorry Wendy's but McDonald's which prides itself on a clean restaurant and friendly staff will get my business."}
{"text":"Nowhere on board did it say what drinks they offer. Girl with tattoos asked if I had my drinks, I said do you see a drink in my hand, took her 5 minutes to get 2 drinks. Fries not evenly distributed in container. Root beer was flat. Sandwich was ok but stomach turned sour not long after, had to release fart, I gagged.  I feel like I will take massive dump tomorrow morning around 4am."}
{"text":"I am not really much of a fast food fan, but they do have a nice cranberry-chicken salad and the service at the drive through is pretty quick and the people working there are always friendly. It's my go-to fast food place when I'm in a rush."}
{"text":"Stopped here today with my 7 year old grandson for lunch today. He had a kid's meal cheeseburger, fries, and frosty. They forgot to put the toy (in this case a book) in his kid's meal. This is a big deal to a 7 year old. I went up and asked after we were done eating and they gave me the little book. I had a small frosty and junior cheeseburger. It was exactly the same thing as the kid's meal burger but had a scrap of red onion on it. But, for $.99 it was OK. Service was horribly slow and ALL of the food was way over salted. The dining area was sort of dingy and the tables had not been cleaned. The windows and doors looked like they had not been cleaned in a very long time."}
{"text":"Barely stretching two stars on this one, but between customers causing me to wait longer for a simple order, I don't want to come back here. My food was completely up to par, so nothing wrong at all with that. The staff was definitely not happy to be there, even though it was a Saturday, I can understand but there is no need to be blatantly cynical and negative in front of the customers. One of the older ladies who looked like she was of management kept yelling at one girl to \"look alive\" and stop \"standing around like you ain't got nothing to do\". Kinda rude in my opinion. Will not visit again unless I'm really hungry or desperate for food."}
{"text":"Service is fast. Managers are friendly. Dark chocolate chip cookies are soooooo good. Price is reasonable. I order the  chicken pecan salad it was better than I thought considering it's fast food. Salad was Fresh, chicken was hot it was perfect!! said Goldilocks. I've tried the artisan Bacon sandwich for breakfast once again 5stars. The only thing I would say about Wendy's restaurant that's not cool is the fact that they cut down the 5-4 chicken nuggets. That was a bit dramatic, considering same price. Other than that frostys are good."}
{"text":"I ask myself why I do this to myself... Oh ya I'm stuck at the airport in a bad mood and need to eat. Honestly there were other options but this was quick and I could take it and sit in an anti-social corner of the airport.   So about the actual food/service. The cashier was halfway decent. Better than I expect at the airport. The fries were hot and fresh but the burger was eh.... when I unwrapped it the bun was kinda soggy... Yuck.  I would say it's three stars on the scale of airport fast food."}
{"text":"Perfectly acceptable food fast. I had a chicken salad that met expectations. A medium drink is monstrous, beware."}
{"text":"First of all, I am new in this area visiting my aunt from the hospital. We went to get a drink at this Wendy's and the first door was closed. So we thought lol and then we saw a different door and we found out that door was just stuck. And the girls working there were like laughing about it.  And I guess they were like you need more muscles or whatever. Rudee!!  They were like being all clumsy knocking stuff over and laughing. This girl came out from the door from the register and locked the girl out I guess and the girl locked out threw some cup lids at her. Totally unprofessional. I wont be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Perhaps it is due to my experiences in dtown Balto that I may have a skewed opinion, but anyone who tries to say that this location has shady patrons is woefully incorrect.  As of today, I have gone to this location throughout every part of the day.  Today, sunday morning, I walked into the fast food joint while half the restaurant was blocked off for prospective vibrant wendy's employees training.  their overplayed commercial promoting their breakfast, specifically their \"fresh cracked eggs cooked on a griddle\" thing, finally inspired me to wake up before noon for the first time in a while to head to wendy's for breakfast.  I got the artisan egg sandwich with sausage combo (which includes their roasted potato slices and a drink (OJ costs 80 cents extra)).  I thought that the roasted potato slices would turn out too gourmet, which i was NOT looking for.  But praise whatever you'd like me to praise, they did use a good amount of starch to give it the outside crunch reminiscent of a french fry or a tator tot.  thumbs up to that.  unfortunately, i may have come too late to get the fresh batch of sausage patties, but mine came out a bit dry.  Then why 5 stars? the 99 cent junior bacon cheeseburger.  my goodness, it could be the best 99 cent fast food item of all time.  i've ordered as many as 6 at once before, and no more than 1 was made with any type of cheese translational misregistration relative to the sausage patty substrate (did i just reveal my identity as a loser? i hope not). in layman's terms, every little cheeseburger came out constructed perfectly, with one slice of fresh tomato, crisp green lettuce, and most importantly, their bacon.  overall, i'm partially thankful to be in pittsburgh because of how near i live to this wendy's, and because pittsburgh is one of only around four metropolitan areas where wendy's currently offers breakfast. although nothing would ever match up to in n out, this is my go-to place to satiate my cravings i get as a socal fast-food junkie."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich was apparently made of rubber stolen from the Firestone shop across the street.  The fries were remarkable in their degree of sogginess and limpitus.  Could be the worst Wendy's west of the Mississippi.  Way to many food choices in Gilbert to expose yourself to such tasteless mediocrity.  I mean no disrespect to the folks that work here."}
{"text":"Tips:  Pay with card, obtain a receipt. They don't give you one.  Pay with cash, count your change. They give out the wrong change on purpose.   Check your order on the stop. It's like talking to a wall."}
{"text":"Try parking here during the day. You can't. When I've eaten there was good but again a difficult spot to park. Did I mention parking"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for a quick bite while running errands. Staff were so very friendly and efficient that I had to take time to let them know. Food was extremely fresh and quick. Great experience! I was even wished a merry Christmas! Great job Wendy's team!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"A normal Wendy's.  Sadly this is not one of the ones that are remodeled.  Food was the same as all other Wedy's.  Only thing I did not like was one of the workers standing there complaining about Obama and healthcare."}
{"text":"Good food. Weird employees. They were sitting all over each other in the dining room."}
{"text":"Our food was awful and service was awful.  The employees were all standing around talking.   Our burgers were dry and our fries were soo old.  They just remodeled and it looks great, all new soda machines.   The food and staff was better before they remodeled.   Hopefully it gets better."}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of Wendy's, but this location leaves a lot to be desired. The food is overall standard quality, but the customer service is horrible. They are extremely slow at the counter and I have never seen anyone cleaning the restaurant area. The drive thru is often backed up, and again very slow. It is frustrating to go to a fast for location and wait 10-15 minutes to be served."}
{"text":"Ordered a single burger w nothing on it except for pickles, milk, a medium frosty.  As the order was  repeated back Asa cheeseburger.  Corrected and said I wanted a plain burger w pickle.   Got to the window, I mentioned the milk was not received, was told not charged so paid separately.  Got home, I had a single cheeseburger w mayo and a pickle.  What part of plain hamburger did the order taker not hear.  Won't visit here again.  Snotty employees."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's ever. Slowest service ever and it's not even busy. Go to a different location or eat somewhere else 0/5. You will wait in a drive thru line for 20 minutes when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Incredibly overpriced (even for an airport).  2 cheeseburgers and a coke = $15.  Servers are generally friendly.  Food is hot and fresh.  Limited seating so you might not have a table during busy hours.  I've stopped here several times just for the convenience, but the prices are pretty absurd."}
{"text":"So I was told a 15 min wait on potatoes and to pull around, with a very long wait By the time I got back around I was told they didn't have them...it would take another 49 mins  This person was rude, wine be back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I've ever been to and I am a life long fan. I usually drive an extra 2 miles when I want Wendy's cuz this one is so horrible. I gave it a third chance tonight and it was a huge mistake. I got 2 burgers and a fry and a drobk. They tell me to pull forward I wait 5 minutes then they forgot my ranch and my DRINK. And they burgers weren't even right. They couldn't even do that super simple order. I hope this locale gets struck by a meteor seriously"}
{"text":"Went to Olive Garden in same parking lot for dinner and had to use restroom but it was utterly disgusting and not even usable. Walked across parking lot to this Wendy's and what a relief! Outstanding bathroom. Clean and smelled nice. For a fast food chain restaurant to have a bathroom this nice is unheard of. This outstanding bathroom almost made me go get my family and leave Olive Garden to go have dinner at this very clean Wendy's."}
{"text":"Grabbed a salad for lunch at the drive-thru.  Got towards the end of it and pulled a long brown hair from my mouth.  And it wasn't my hair because I'm bald.    Two words for you Wendy's: hair net."}
{"text":"When this Wendy's first opened, it was bustling with people, food was good, and the service was great. Now that the honeymoon period is over, it is just yet another \"meh\" fast food place on campus.  The burgers taste rather plain. I recall eating the pretzel burger most recently, and it was quite disappointing. The fries, arguably the most important part of any fast food place that actually sells fries, are neither crispy on the outside nor fluffy on the inside, and these fries were *just* fried. The saving grace of this Wendy's is that it has one of those fantastic soda machines with a touch screen that can dispense all sorts of flavors; this is one of the few places where I can find Dr. Pepper."}
{"text":"After they had the remodel, they seemed to have things together.  The more time has gone on, however, this location has seriously gone down hill.  If they don't screw up your order the food is usually bad.   Just visited this location for a chicken wrap. Got it home and the chicken piece was seriously the size of chicken nugget.  Give me a break.  I will no longer be visiting this location. Tired of being disappointed when I am hungry!"}
{"text":"The employees at this Wendy's are magicians They can magically take the same order for lunch and dinner for five days straight \"taco salad \" and every order have something missing. whether it is the chips one day. Or the salsa the same evening. It doesn't matter what day what time they can never get an order correct they magically make something disappear.     Is training lacking.  or do these people just not care?"}
{"text":"This location looks very nice, it has a perfect location. But the service is absolutely ridiculously horrendous. We tried ordering 5 times and the lady at the drive through kept repeating the wrong thing. We offered to drive up to the window and she yelled at us. To top it all off the entire order was wrong. Wow....."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru ever. If I could give zero stars I would. Rude people who yell at you. They don't know the menu at all and claim they don't have what your ordering which is clearly listed on the menu. I have never been more mad at a place in my life. AVOID THIS LOCATION. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The food is good , but your staff is so annoying, today 4/23/2018.   At 9:15 pm . One of your employees was talking and talking and bringing up all he complains to the other employees and it was really uncomfortable, I even told them to go and deal with their problems out , they made my dinner so stressful !!! I'll think twice to go back!!!"}
{"text":"24 hours, but let's explore this a bit.  Walk in at 0230 thinking I would be able to have a burger at least.  Nope, grill is off, according to my sales person, from 0130 to 0300 for cleaning.  I suggested in a question as to why the whole grill is shut down, do one side at a time, was told it is all connected.  Didn't have time to drive to another truck stop as I was on my federally mandated 30 minute break so opted for the spicy chicken meal.  This is where the two stars come in.  I get from another employee that my fries are holding me up from eating, because he could serve me cold ones.  I had 30 minutes to kill, no biggie.  Get my meal and the spicy chicken is old and luke warm at best for internal temperature.  Sales person handles the fries and ends up mixing the old with the fresh, so every bite was a mystery of where it would be fresh or hours old.  Next time, will go to Subway which seems to be 24 hrs as well."}
{"text":"Food was yummy but the store was dirty.  The counters and floor were not clean which is scary when they serve your food!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for...that is the saying. It rings true every time, too. This location is hit and miss both foodwise and customer service wise. I've encountered the good and bad with both."}
{"text":"Look no further    Looking for a healthy salad at a fast food establishment can be challenging  to say the least.  After all most fast food restaurants aren't know for their great tasting salads.  With that in mind I decided to give Wendy's a try.  I gave the menu a quick look over and decided to order the Apple Pecan Chicken Salad.    After the first bite I was convinced  Wendy's is pulling away from the fast food salad pack by offering flavorful salad options.  The Apple Pecan Chicken Salad is a mix of greens (Iceberg, Romaine, and Spring) with blue cheese crumbles, dried cranberries, candied pecans, apple chunks, and grilled chicken pieces with a raspberry vinaigrette. I enjoyed the taste of the sweet apples, sugared pecans, cranberries and chicken. I am not a fan blue cheese crumbles  so I asked to keep that off. All the mixtures of taste and flavor came  together and allowed for a surprisingly  light and very tasteful salad.    I have returned back for the  Apple Pecan Chicken Salad--fresh, plenty of flavor, and just six bucks.  How can you beat that. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick after school snack. Ordered 4 Frosty, Chicken Nuggets and a Jr Bacon burger. The nuggets were hot, the burger was not and the Frosty's were as expected.  I went through the drive through very quickly and the staff was friendly. Wish the burger warm. Would return for the Frosty and skip ordering the food."}
{"text":"The manager I spoke to Bernie is dumber than a sack of nails. Asked when the Strawberry Fields salad was going to be featured. This lady was nasty. Told me to \"Google it\". What??? If you don't know, just say it, but don't be rude. I ignored her rude remark and went ahead and ordered a cheeseburger with pickle and mustard only and she ball faced looked at me and said \"this isn't Burger King\". No, no it isn't and I left your dirty, filthy restaurant and went to In N'  Out. Never again. Get new management staff. One star should be NO STARS!"}
{"text":"Good food .. just had a little issue with the customer service . Can't remember the young lad name but it wasn't pleasant .. but great food"}
{"text":"It is a Wendy's, but based against other Wendy's, this was a nice one.  Located just outside of the mall.  Clean restaurant, friendly staff, and the food quality was good."}
{"text":"Today is the last time I will be dealing with this location and probably Wendy's as a whole since I don't know any other location. I've been to this location quite a few times and recently have had to deal with a very rude lady at drive through. I believe she is SUPPOSED to be in a management role but is clearly unqualified. She always has a terrible attitude, rushes you through every part of your experience and is just overall unpleasant. My coworkers had actually stopped coming to this location because of her. Today I came to the drive through on my lunch break and ordered a cheeseburger combo for myself and a cheeseburger for my coworker. While ordering I asked that one burger not have veggies on it to which this rude person said \"what?!\" I started saying I didn't want pickles, lettuce, tomatoes etc since it seemed like she hadn't heard me. However she cut me of and rudely said \"yes, I know what veggies are thank you.\" I've worked in the service industry so I know how to talk to people, I was not speaking in any sort of tone or sounding condescending, simply just trying to order food. Her attitude and choice of words was unwarranted and certainly NOT how patrons should be spoken to. At the window all she told me was what my total was and that my receipt was in the bag. No thank you, no have a nice day, no is there anything else you need. I took my food and left but was even further disappointed once I got back to work to eat when I found she had not given me a straw, my fries were cold and soggy and MY BURGER HAD VEGGIES ON IT. Really disappointed that I will no longer enjoy Wendy's thanks to this terrible employee and wasted money on a lunch I did NOT enjoy."}
{"text":"Slow , slow service . Drive thru orders are slow spent 15 minutes in line for a chicken sandwich . Ended up just leaving because of the poor service . There are plenty of options for food around this area . I would chose another .. Good luck if you chose this spot ."}
{"text":"This place sucks and the service blows.  Waited for 5 minutes with one person in front of me then another 5 mintues - Not fast food at all - Del Taco would probably be better next door or you may make it home in ten minutes to cook yourself something to eat -nuff said"}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best Wendy's I've ever been too! They are always very fast and accurate with taking orders !  Five stars on Yelp because their food is bomb !"}
{"text":"The spicy chicken sandwich was the worst I ever ate.  The chicken was fried long time ago and was kept warm in an oven.  The chicken was very dry.  Taste like sandpaper.  Never order another chicken sandwich from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I showed up at about one in the morning, so I'm talking about the mid shift specifically. The customer service was second to none. I honestly felt like I was being carefully taken care with this staff. I asked for a meal with chili instead of fries. I got fries in my bag, so before I turned to leave I happened to realize my bag was a little lighter than it should be. Turned back, and a very nice lady swapped it out and apologized multiple times and wished me to have a good night and to come back soon. If the establishment happens to read this, I came at 1:45 on Dec 18th. The African American lady, a longer haired younger guy, and a white manager with short white hair definitely needs a kudos!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Wendys. I always get spicy chicken go wraps, but every time I get them here. It's worst than the last. The chicken is over cooked, or it's very small. A pound of ranch, or 2 shreds of lettuce. Really!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's gives fast food a bad name.  Simple order and still waiting after half hour.  It was a simple order"}
{"text":"I have never encountered a place where they mess up as often as this location. Other Wendy's locations have their errors here and there, but here almost EVERY SINGLE visit is a mistake. The manager doesn't care either. Emails to management have not helped. It can be seemingly little things like no forks or butter for your bakes potato and salad to major things like everything on your burger when you asked for specific things. Check every order and almost every single order is wrong."}
{"text":"About every other day on my way into work I have a choice to make. Do I make a right and go to Mickey D's for a sausage mcmuffin with egg, then have to wait at the light to cross over the traffic at Deer Valley. Or do I make a left on 23rd then right into the Wendy's parking lot for a new Artisan Sausage sandwich? The first time I made that decision I felt like going to catholic confession. \"Dear Father, forgive me for I have sinned. It has been 24 years since my last confession. I cheated on my favorite fast food breakfast today...\" After that day, I always drive by and wave at the relationship with McDonalds that I kicked to the curb for the hotter better breakfast fast food. The sandwich is awesome, soft artisan bread with fresh cracked egg (yoke still intact) asiago cheese and a \"not greasy\" sausage patty and hollandaise sauce. The potatoes are country style wedges with the skin still on them. The coffee rivals' dunkin doughnuts and the drive through is super efficient. Can you believe that they actually take the time to look at my CC and thank me by name? Before you go out to your local Wendy's in search of breakfast bliss, check to see if they serve the new menu items. I have driven 15 miles off course and to three restaurants looking for the new menu items in the east valley. Not all restaurants carry the new breakfast menu.   McDonalds I am filing for divorce and I want alimony for all those years that you could have provided me a healthier better tasting breakfast sandwich. My breakfast lawyer will be contacting you soon."}
{"text":"Service is usually slow. Food is always good. I usually only get thier healthy salads and a baked potato or chili."}
{"text":"It was fairly late when we arrived. The place was empty but again it was after 8:00pm. We salads a baked potato and a chili. Plus two drinks. The food came hot and fresh. The dining area was clean but somewhat chilly. Experience was overall pleasant."}
{"text":"Been to this location numerous times, the service depends on which day you go and the how the staffing is for the day. When you order something and they don't have everything you want, they should tell the person off the bat, not wait til the order is done and then tell you no chili cause they ran out so, you get a taco salad w/o chili. That's not a taco salad then, it's a salad with nacho chips. They were about to have us walk away without all the order."}
{"text":"We waited over 10 mins for our food and when we got home (a two minute drive) everything was cold. Our French fries were all soggy and the containers weren't even filled halfway. My burger was absolutely disgusting. It was lukewarm at best and soggy and just didn't taste good at all!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Do not acknowledge you when you are waiting in line for service. There was no service with a smile. Disappointed being in Scottsdale that this Wendy's had poor service. I normally read reviews before going places. I took for granted the city was in and expected more."}
{"text":"Horrible. I came to get a vanilla frosty and half way down I see a hair. It wasn't mine because my hair was up and it is long. I wish I would have seen it before leaving rather than being half way done and almost home. This is unacceptable. I wish I would've read the reviews before wasting my money on a chain restaurant. Wendy's- do better."}
{"text":"Tuesday, May 9th 2017 at 5:30 PM  I have seen this commercial a million times for the limited time chicken Mozzarella salad.  I finally tried it and it's definitely worth $6.50.   There was chunks of chicken and mozzarella.  The basil pesto was a great touch and I loved that the most!    The croutons had sea salt, garlic and pepper.  The vingarette was Okay... I wished there was more basil pesto.   I ordered my salad as take out, this location is around the corner. Easier to leave out the back around the back side of Albertsons but we live West up Flamingo."}
{"text":"Cashier was really cool with my custom order.  I had 2 Jr Bacon Cheeseburgers, Both No Bun no Tomato. The even cooler chick behind the make like walked up and asked if I wanted the lettuce. I said, \"Wow. Yes, thank you\".  My boyfriend had TWO Crispy Chickens since they're 99 cents each and a Medium Sprite.  Food came out hot and it was super good. I was considering going up and getting their Chili Fries.. I decided to save my appetite for dinner later. I should remember next time I'm allergic to the mayo (modified corn starch 90% of the time) but I let it go for a day. There was a BLOB of mayo on one of them so I just scraped it off the extra. No big deal..  Service was FAST, friendly, & lobby clean too.  If you fill out the survey on the back you get $2 off a premium Salad I should give them a try with the wheat, corn allergy. I just hope they're salads come with pecan instead of walnuts...That's for the next adventure to Wendy's."}
{"text":"We were coming from Red Rock to pick up our pumpkin pies.  We were starving and my boyfriend mentioned he wanted Wendy's. We wanted to check it out since it was renovated and decided since we're right here,  why not?   Briona our cashier greeted us with a big smile.  I ordered the Portabella melt protein style (no bun, add lettuce). The boyfriend had a 1/2 lb double meal.   The soda machine was out of everything besides Dasini, Barq's Root Beer, and Minute made. Yuck. We let someone know while we waited for the food to come up.  Someone offered to go to the fountain in the back & we asked for Coca-Cola.  Then the guy serving up the food was nice,  I let him know the order was missing the lettuce & he fixed it really quick.   The food was hot,  fresh and most importantly served in a reasonable amount of time. 3-4 minutes. The restaurant was very clean. We loved the make over & the employees were all super friendly.  Which is great I hate it when you go somewhere & there's that one sour person working that brings the whole staff friendliness down.  Great team work. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have tried this Wendy's. Every time they get my order wrong. This time the girl at the window said I didn't order correctly. I said no ice!!! I live in the Steele Creek area and we have plenty of fast places here and they are all very professional. Except Wendy's! Don't go, go across the street to MDs or Smithfield's."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there a few days ago. The two women working the drive-through were amazingly nice and respectful. Even when I didn't complete my order she was extremely polite and guided me without just assuming anything. Definitely went the extra mile. The food was fresh, it was delicious, the staff was beyond friendly in a genuine manner. I am not impressed very often, these guys definitely left an imprint. Good job, guys and thank you!"}
{"text":"Why is this Wendy's so awful? There's another 10 minutes away on Howe Rd that's ALWAYS good...even when they're extremely busy.  This one is dirty, drive-_thru signs are busted, food is always cold...it's like a completely different restaurant! Why? Wendy's would be better off shutting it down than letting it operate the way it does."}
{"text":"So this Wendy's usually provides terrible customer service as well as the quality of food. Hence that is probably why there haven't been that many reviews on this particular one. I visited here a couple weeks ago and had an order for my co-workers as well. When I asked for the fries to be fresh I got an attitude from the girl that was taking my order all because I requested fresh ones. The chicken nuggets that are on that value menu are a joke and I even question if it's actually the 100% chicken that they advertise. Generally I stay away from fast food to avoid  all these above reasons."}
{"text":"Alright...after the Greenway Wendy's unveiling, perhaps I 'm a little jilted. But, this Wendy's pales in comparison to its counterpart.  The decor is dated. The drink machine offers only the standard beverages. The service is ho-hum.  After attending the Yelp unveiling of the newly renovated Wendy's, I can only sit and wait for renovation money to make its way to this location..."}
{"text":"It looks as though Wendy's is trying to reinvent themselves...and from what I've seen so far, they're well on their way!  Before moving away from North Phoenix, my family and I had been to this particular location a handful of times. It was your typical Wendy's experience. No bells and whistles, except for the drink machine...which, by the way, appears to have several HUNDRED possible drink combinations. The decor looked like it has since I was a kid (p.s. a long time ago)...dated, to say the least.  Even driving up to the Yelp Event, I barely recognize the building. From the outside, you can see that there have been MAJOR renovations done. There are sleek, dark, tinted windows all along the roof line, coupled with ceiling to floor tinted windows surrounding the new seating area.  After checking out the Yelp table (and picking up a couple of \"Here's The Beef\" t-shirts), my family and I went in.  Upon passing through the second glass door, we were IMMEDIATELY lost. EVERYTHING had changed!   The first thing that caught our attention was the all new seating area immediately to the left. There are two sets of two chairs facing one another, making for a rather intimate setting. Hung on the wall is a beautiful HDTV. But, the piece de resistance for the seating area was the faux fireplace. It was absolutely beautiful!  The overall decor has been completely modernized. The old, tired booths and seats have been replaced with updated seating. On top of the dividing walls, there are beautiful glass accents. Where there used to be boring run-of-the-mill booths on the left of the dining area, there is now a gorgeous \"Arizona Room-esque\" glass palace. Within this seating area, there is another, albeit smaller, HDTV hung in the corner.  Now, on to the service. I know there was a Yelp event going on, and you always put on a good show for company, but the management at this location really seem to have embraced the change that Wendy's is trying to make. Three different managers were walking throughout the dining area, greeting all of the customers, and handing out coupons for free things (burgers, fries, frosties, etc.). In fact, one of the managers offered to carry our food, and escorted us through the dining area to our seats. I know it's hard to get excited about the service at a fast food restaurant, but at least there's a ray of hope after today.  Based on what I saw, it looks like Wendy's is well on their way to righting the ship as far as their restaurants are concerned. I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on these upgrades. If they can keep up the great service, and ride the wave of the buzz created by these renovations, I'm sure they're going to see a FANTASTIC return on their investment!  Thank you to Lindsey and her team for making my first Yelp event an awesome one!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is one of the newly remodeled editions here in the Valley. Like at least one other that I've visited, the new decor inside is pretty impressive. If you've ever been to a Wendy's, you know that the decor really hasn't changed much over the decades. Those days, however, are officially over.  The most prominent of all of the changes is the faux fireplace with the lounge seating area. There are four lowboy lounge chairs surrounding two small tables seating in front of the fireplace, with a nice HD television mounted on the wall above. It LOOKS really nice. But, as I stayed a little while, I noticed how uncomfortable these chairs appeared to be for every patron who sat in them.   Being that the chairs are low, and clearly built for relaxation rather than function, there doesn't appear to be any comfortable way to sit in them while eating your food. The seat portion is quite deep, allowing you to appear like you're reclining. However, that particular position is not conducive to comfortable eating. Every time a patron wanted to take a bite, they had to awkwardly make their way back to the edge of the chair to get back to their food. From there, the customers didn't have any back support. Plus, if you're a tall person, your knees are guaranteed to be up in your chest while you're leaning forward to get to your food. If you're a child or a smaller person, your legs are going to dangle off of the edge, as the cushion is so deep. It's truly a Catch 22 sitting in these seats to dine. As a lounge, though, it's quite nice.  My family and I managed to get a much more comfortable seat at one of the bar-style high tops located around the many floor-to-ceiling windows. It gave us a great opportunity to see what a train wreck the parking lot at this particular location can be. This day happened to be particularly crowded, it seemed. Every time somebody tried to pull out of their parking spot, they had to wait for what seemed like five minutes before there was a clearing. The way this parking lot is designed, if you take a left out of the drive-thru and go back around the building, you're pretty much screwed. You'll end up fighting people trying to get INTO the drive-thru, as well as the people trying to leave the parking lot to get out altogether. So, a word to the wise, turn right out of the drive-thru.  At its core, it's still a Wendy's. There are a few new additions to the menu, but it's pretty much the same old same old. If you do visit this remodeled version of Wendy's, try to go during an off-peak time. That way, you can avoid the general chaos that ensues when this place is at capacity."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Wendy's in Las Vegas to be honest and you would think that being that close to the strip you'd provide some of the best customer service but sheesh that must be too much to ask! Then again when i reevaluate the area and realize that it's pretty much the hang out spot for prostitutes Nd homeless people I can't get that type of service..anyways thankfully all o really came for was a chocolate frosty and some spicy nuggets! Had to wait extra time for them but hey at least I knew they were fresh right? The guy working drive thru that day handed me my frosty with no straw or spoon suppose he felt that eating it with my hands would've been better :-)"}
{"text":"Where's the Beef?   The Chicken sandwich looked like it was stamped from a machine. It had the texture of one of those big pink erasers you had from back when you were in school.  The lettuce and tomato were anemic. The sandwich was was virtually tasteless.  What the hell is this stuff made of?  The fries were terrible and way, way over salted.  The Chilli - more like tomato soup.  \"Where's the Beef?\" Sparse is putting it mildly.  What about the beans... I actually counted 2 in my large Chilli.   This place is the pits. The food is not fresh and it is extremely unsatisfying. Avoid it... there are so many better choices."}
{"text":"I frequent this Wendy's at least once a week.  Their salads and summer flavored teas are my favorite which is why I stopped by to get my usual lunch combo today.  Ordered the 1/2 size Asian Chicken Salad.  When I get back to my office and open my bag expecting a yummy lunch I find a salad minus over 1/2 the chicken I am used to seeing.  Seriously? I paid for less than 1/4 of a chicken breast over lettuce? Really disappointed.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"What the hell, I'll review a Wendy's!  It was fast (no surprise), efficient (no surprise), and both tasty and fresh (holy crap!!!).  Granted, I ordered one of their salads and steered clear of the rest, but man, I didn't know fast food burger joints actually offered a decent salad.  Like, the kinda thing I wouldn't be ashamed to serve friends!  Had the Apple Pecan Chicken Salad (which also contained blue cheese!).  As said, very fresh and very tasty.  I was left quite pleased and surprisingly full for the low-low price of $4.99.  It should be noted that I declined the salad dressing.  Anything with blue cheese, chicken, pecans, and cranberries doesn't need whatever packaged slop they provide.  It had more than enough flavour as it was.  So I can't believe I'm giving 4 stars to a friggin' Wendy's.  I feel an ounce of shame, but let no one ever accuse me of being anything less than open-minded.  Now to go throw stones at their windows for contributing to the embiggening of North Americans (and the world).  Their salad may be perfectly cromulent, but the majority of their menu is the pits."}
{"text":"How does this location stay open? Homeless people in the dining room, and they always screw up orders. It's hard to believe a store in north Scottsdale could be this bad. Somebody needs to do something"}
{"text":"Someday Wendy, and I don't know when, we're gonna get to the place we really wanna go, where this franchise no longer exists.  I could not possibly dislike Wendy's any more, but the fact that they would not let me in to use their outlet when there was a rainstorm outside (and I was eating a frosty to console myself), and my car had broken down, was really telling. This is after buying something, by the way.   They weren't even mean about it, they just seemed like mindless robots saying no no we can't, no we can't, no it's against our policy. Well okay, but giving Wendy's more than one star is against my policy. And by the way I did get a frosty from this exact location on two occasions... the other was about 6 months earlier than this and it didn't even taste as half-decent as the usual Wendy's frosty. But that's beside the point."}
{"text":"Worst ever! Was told 20 mins for baked potato then another 15 after that. Working for postmates and customers are waiting. We literally waited almost an hour and no baked potato. Fast food my ass. Why wouldn't you have the baked potatoes ready?  Ridiculous and unacceptable. This place is horrible."}
{"text":"Awful customer service. I was ordering my food in the drive thru, and the girl kept cutting me off telling me my total when I wasn't finished ordering. She had a sarcastic attitude whenever I asked a question and kept having side conversations as I was ordering. I'll never come here again."}
{"text":"Has recently been renovated form the last time I was here and it is looking ver nice now!  When I came today it was for my Grandpa's birthday because he loves nothing more than a Wendy's frosty!  We got four large chocolate frosty's for $11 so it wasn't a bad price compared to if we were to go to Dairy Queen or something where it is a lot more expensive!  We also always get the traditional chocolate ones rather than the vanilla ones :)"}
{"text":"Gross! I went this afternoon. Ordered two chicken wraps and a baked potato. There was hair in my chicken wrap, the chicken was under cooked even though they made me pull up and wait. The baked potato was dirty and dehydrated from microwaving I guess. Extremely disappointed and disgusted. I threw up after eating the first wrap and finding hair and undone chicken in the second one. Wtf Wendy's. I used to love Wendy's. Gross."}
{"text":"Out of all the Wendy's locations I've been to, this one isn't bad at all.  I hate eating fast food but when you've been working 6am to 10:30pm and you don't feel like grocery shopping after leaving the office, this isn't the worst burger place to go.  I've yet to bite into anything gross and hard like I have at McDonald's and Burger King.  It's still greasy fast food but like I said it's not the worst out of the late night options."}
{"text":"Sooooo slow. The drive thru takes forever and there's not even that long of a line. 4 cars total in drive thru and it took 25 minutes to get my order, what's the point of Fast food if it isn't fast?"}
{"text":"Sometimes I work in the area and this is really convenient. There are not many fast food places along Carefree Highway, and this Wendy's is new and clean.  I've gone inside and through the drivethru, and my order has been made quick and fresh each time. The restroom was clean, which is always a big plus.  Wendy's in general seems to be keeping up with the times, having better menu choices both health wise and price wise. I wouldn't drive out of my way to go here, but I have had no reason to seek a quick bite to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We keep expecting their food to be better than the last time. I've had enough. Ordered two spicy chicken combos yesterday at around 5 o'clock. You'd think the food would be fresh during the dinner-time rush. Well, you'd be wrong. The sandwiches and fries were all lukewarm, and both chicken filets were so dry and tough that they must have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. We ordered an unsweetened iced tea and a Sprite with no ice. Received an unsweetened tea with no ice and a cup of ice with some Sprite in it.  We've previously been treated rudely for having the gall to use the drive thru 20 minutes before closing time. I'm trying to remember if we have ever been served a satisfactory meal there, but I'm having trouble coming up with a single example. I can only assume that the manager is never there or is so incompetent as to defy belief. This location coasts by solely on the reputation of other Wendy's. Do yourself a favor. Go to Burger King or McDonald's down the road, or hike up to the Wendy's at West View Park."}
{"text":"Good food for its \"fast food\" label. I recommend the baconator. Quite delicious and juicy. Drive through is efficient."}
{"text":"The food is fresh as F$&@! And the strip view is amazing. I would recommend bringing that special guy or girl here anytime."}
{"text":"It was 9:58pm Went through drive thru  they forgot my straws and spoon for my frosty. Not making big deal I parked my car started going to the door and an employee started walking toward it and locked the door I explained to him they forgot my straws and spoon he walked over grabbed 20 straw then gave gave them to me and I told him I also needed a straw he rolled his eyes at me grabbed 7 spoons to me. I've worked in the fast food service so I understand how frustrating it is but I would never treat my customers like that when my crew made the mistake in the first place."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Has a digital soda machine. Very cool. It also has a Decorative fireplace with compfy chairs. The service is always perfect and the employees are super friendly. I've never had issues here."}
{"text":"Before I start let me just say, I love Wendy's, for fast-food its pretty decent. Now I came to this location one time after work. I ordered a meal for my self, and some chicken nuggets for my nephews. I sat in the drive thru for a while, which is expected, pretty popular place. When I finally reached the drive thru window she told me to pull around to the front, mind you I am driving a lifted white dodge ram, and the only truck in the parking lot. I waited 15 minutes in the very front of the restaurant until I finally went inside to see what was going on with my food. I waited in line, and noticed I did not see the girl who told me to park in the front. I talked to the manager and he told me she did not see me, and came back inside, and it was my fault. I then asked him where she went, and he told me she was on break. So to me it seems she didn't even bother to look because she was going on break, especially because you can see my truck from inside the restaurant. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"This goes for all Wendy's in the area! My wife and I will no longer be eating at Wendy's in an attempt to boycott this restaurant chain for not being family friendly! How can a corporation who donates so much on the issue of adoption not have baby changing tables in the restrooms? This is ridiculous as my wife and I have newborn twins and have to take them it to the car if they need to have their diapers changed while we are sitting in the restaurant having lunch! You have lost our business since I don't think this problem will be fixed anytime soon"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Will avoid it from now on. Both times, the manager was arguing with the employees about insignificant things.  They have a sign out front \"We're Hiring!\"... must be due to the huge turnover when the manager is always ragging on you.  I hope Wendy's Corporate sees this, they need to replace the management."}
{"text":"I went to this location on sept 2014 n it was GREAT ! The staff was super friendly I'm so picky but the chicken was well done my fav part was that they Dont charge for ranch lol , my order was done in 2 mins or less !! The lemonade was taste . I gotta admit I only went cause of my coworkers so I gave it a try n I Dont regret it !! The Wendy's by my house doesn't compare to this one"}
{"text":"I should have checked my bag before I left the drive thru.  I ordered the #7, which is the homestyle chicken sandwich meal.  They did not repeat the order back, nor did it show on the screen.  I also was not given a receipt, so I don't know if they had my order correct or not.  I got home and found that I was given the completely wrong order.  I have been trying to call for the past thirty minutes, but there is no answer.   I gave two stars because this is the first time I have ever had a problem at this location.  But, a burger when you're expecting a chicken sandwich is completely dissatisfying."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Wendy's I've ever been to.  Also very dirty.  Came at 2:15 in the afternoon and I took 15 minutes to get burger and fries."}
{"text":"I ran in today for a large fry, worst idea ever. The cashier was so slow that the food for customers was ready before she had finished ringing them up. My fries weren't filled all of the way, which isn't the worst in the world unless you are really craving fries like I was. I live very close to this location and have never been there, now I see that I'll never be back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in after hiking In AZ.  It was lunch time so after hiking we were famished.  We ordered a couple of the burgers and fries along with a chili and a chocolate Frosty.  We got it to go.  The service was fast considering it was lunch time.  Our order was correct and we were quickly on our way home.    The burgers were just as I remembered from the first time I had Wendy's when I was much younger.  The fries were crispy and tasty.  The Frosty was thick and delicious.  The chili was good and it had the consistent flavor I remember.  The daughter wanted to try it.  It isn't the best chili I have ever had but on a cold day it is pretty decent.        Unlike many who bash Fast Food places for some crazy reasons I don't do that.  I judge them on service, cleanliness and consistency.  It is fast food so if i wanted a fancy sit down meal them I should have went to a fancy place.  This Wendy's met my expectations and therefore earned the 4 stars I gave them."}
{"text":"So far, so good with this location. Everyone I've dealt with late night and afternoon have been very courteous even with my special orders (i.e. no ice, sauce on the side, etc).  For what you'd expect from a fast food place I give them a 5 star right now. Note: just like most establishments in the area there are plenty of panhadlers around, but I haven't been bothered by the ones around this restaurant yet. Hope I didn't \"jinx\" myself by saying that...lollololol. Just kidding. Maybe I'm not kidding. Wait! Yes I am just kidding. :D  Anyway, check 'em out for freshly fried treats, cool salads (if you're into that;), and Frosties when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and new coffee burgers are always hot and fresh and rotating in new toppings. New soda fountain and frosty's rule"}
{"text":"Always dependable. Good burgers, fries, chicken sandwich and love the chili."}
{"text":"Cleanest Wendy's ever, super efficient, friendly staff. Decent coffee and good value menu items."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Never gets the order right and the food is usually cold. From the wrong drink to something as simple as no mayo on the sandwich. When you ask them to fix it, they still get it wrong. I don't know in what language \"no mayo\" translates to \"pickles only.\"  And, the manager just laughs when you ask them to correct it.  Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I could leave this Wendy's zero stars, I would. They line takes about 10x as long as it should, when we get to the window the staff is moving so slow, and the staff is rude and unanopolegetic. Food doesn't taste fresh half the time."}
{"text":"Every time I have picked up dinner for my family here the people at the drive thru window have been extremely friendly!  Best drive thru experience I've had ever at a fast food restaurant.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"So I have been here since my first review, and its always the same, dried out fries, and burgers that looked like the fat ass staff sat there fat asses on it before they push it thru the drive thru windows...I swear I took a bite out of a baconator and the bacon tasted rotten. I have decided I will only go here for frosty's if I am craving one and it's like 1am and there is no other options anywhere...and that's it. Which means I will never go back...Gross. Wendy's use to be one of my favorite fast food places to eat...not anymore."}
{"text":"Food was okay, taco salad looked gross.  Felt bad for friend eating it came with a bag of chips and packaged salsa.  They double billed me had to go back and get my charge reversed.  The sad part was how dirty the floors, tables, and the same garbage in the floor was there when returned for my refund.  Didn't offer anything for the round trip, although I wouldn't have taken anything.  Disgraceful. They get one star because I had to continue somehow."}
{"text":"Visited this Wendy's today and I'm usually very pleased with the service and food . Now although I received good service the food was horrible . My spicy nuggets we everything but fresh they were hard and disgusting, they gave me regular nuggets for my sons kids meal when I ordered spicy and those were old and hard as well. My fries were gross and very cold . My chili however was very delicious. My patty on my cheeseburger was cold and clearly had been sitting for a while . I wasn't able to eat any of my meal excluding my chili . I will not be returning to this location. I would of been better off visiting Mcdonalds . Completely unhappy !"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience. But Julia came along ,an made my meal worth 100 bucks. Thank you. Way to go."}
{"text":"Pasé por el drive-thru sin mirar Yelp. Craso error.  Con pocas opciones y bastante tarde, decidimos ir por unas hamburguesas rapidas. Hicimos un pedido simple: 5 hamburguesas iguales.  Cuando pasamos a la ventana a retirarlas, nos daban una. El empleado se empezó a reir junto con una compañera cuando le repetimos el pedido, y tardó en alcanzarlas después (nos tuvimos que mover porque había autos atrás), lo cual hizo mientras seguía charlando y en la suya.  Por suerte las hamburguesas eran decentes."}
{"text":"VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! There is literally 8 ppl working on this shift and it took them 10 before anyone even acknowledged me ... Like who is hiring these ppl.... It wouldn't have been as bad if atleast one person spoke or acknowledged that i was standing there well that wendys is a wrap!"}
{"text":"The cashier Erikka is very friendly and makes sure the order is correct. The wait for our food was slow tonight, we waited for 10minutes."}
{"text":"Terrible Service.  My family and I stopped into the Wendy's after picking up out of town relatives from the airport. The manager was quite rude to each of us as we ordered then had the nerve to tell us to eat quick because the lobby was closing early. We arrived at 8:15pm and he said he could keep the lobby open until 8:35pm. Granted this is no 5 star restaurant but to honestly tell customers they have a time limit on their meal is preposterous, especially when you arrive well before the closing time marked on the door."}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten all day. We were tired and wanted something quick and familiar on the way back to the hotel. We saw Wendy's. The fries were cold and undercooked. The crispy chicken sandwich was dry and no extra dressing was applied as requested. Even the sprite seemed flat. I would not go to this particular Wendy's again."}
{"text":"If you're flying out of PHX Terminal 2 in the evening, your only food options are Wendy's and an awful brewpub. I hadn't tried Wendy's since college, and I think it's still a pretty bad choice.   I'm not sure if the 1/3 full fries container in my order was their way of telling me to lay off the fried foods, or their way of not making me eat soggy fries."}
{"text":"Wendy's awesome!  After waiting at the airport for 3 hours, we were starving and decided to get something to go for the ride home. We decided on Wendy's. We got there 3 minutes before they're about to close (they must hate us for doing this.. and I think they close at 1AM?) but customer service was still superb and surprisingly, the food came out very fast. I finally got the chance to try the berry almond chicken salad after seeing it on tv so many times. It was absolutely delicious! The fruits were fresh and the chicken portions were big! The raspberry vinaigrette dressing was really delicious and paired really well with the salad. Also picked up some chicken nuggets, chicken sandwiches and their chili soup. Everything was so delicious and fresh!  Wendy's over McDonalds any day! ;) and it definitely satisfied my tummy."}
{"text":"The mobile app says they sell breakfast tried to call the store to make sure and the phone just ranged no one answered went up to the store and waited about 3 minutes in the drive through no one answer. What waste of a trip."}
{"text":"Every single time you come here they mess up your order. Terrible customer service and just an awful place to be. Wendy's Corporate should shut this place down"}
{"text":"Rudest staff and they mess up your order. Go across river to other fast food chains where order is not messed up and disgusting and people at least say hello."}
{"text":"We have been sitting in this drive thru for over 30mins. Got here at 4:30, not even a prime time. We have spent more money on gas than on the meal! When we got in the drive thru line there was only ONE other car ahead of us. Do NOT go to this Wendy's. The service is beyond slow and the workers do not care. This will make question ever going to Wendy's again."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with my daughter.  The food, well,  it's Wendy's,  and it's getting worse,  but still like a crappy food meal once in a while.   The girls working in here,  are exceptionally friendly and bubbly,  and fun.  Good hiring decisions Wendy's. Much better experience than the past.  I had fun.   I rated 3 stars only cause the food. Not good. But fun.  And nicer dinning room than most.  I was impressed."}
{"text":"Come on, you have a couple of different types of sandwiches and chili.  How hard can it be to get an order right.  Every time I stop, I have to check the order after I get my bag and hand something back that they get wrong."}
{"text":"Refresh on the one star rating, it's been 6 months and this Wendy's has the same crappy service.  Tonight we were shorted a side salad after the bozo at the counter asked 3 times what kind of dressing we wanted.  So we have lots of ranch dressing, but no salad to go under it.  We were also shorted 3 crispy chicken strips, we ordered 4 - 4 strip, got 3 with 3 strips, one with 4.  GOOD LUCK!  HEY, GET A NEW MANAGER AND TRAIN YOUR PEOPLE."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I have EVER been to! And I have been to hundreds around the United States. Totally screwed my salad order, southwest avocado, as the new berry fresh salad was not even available at this location. My salad consisted of lettuce, chicken,tomatoes and cheese!!! Where're is the avocado and the applewood smoked bacon??? The only aspect of salad that would have had any flavor as the cheese was NOT the pepper jack shown or stated that would be on it. Returning tomorrow as not worth eating. Who works at this place? Person preparing screwed up and cashier does not check the order to ensure it is correct before putting in a bag? Some serious training needed. Too bad photos not portable on this site to show Wendy's advertised version of salad and what I received."}
{"text":"Food is normally hot but the fries are so salty they are hard to eat. Another thing I don't understand is that I order the exact same thing every time I go through the drive thru and yet it is somehow always a different price.  Somewhere between $7 and $7.95. The few cents isn't going to break the bank but it makes you wonder what on earth is going on.  By the way I order it at least once a week so it's not like I'm forgetting the price."}
{"text":"Really rude manager!!! Short black hair. The food is great!! Customer service not that well."}
{"text":"The greasiest hamburger I've ever had from a Wendy's store. Also the fries were extremely greasy as well. Very disappointed as I am a regular Wendy's customer and this was awful."}
{"text":"Welcome to the 90's.  This Wendy's still does drinks behind the counter and has NO customer swipe credit card station.   It also feels run down.  The owner is probably just happy for the dumb luck of a football stadium going in nearby.  Why update?    Waiting in line for soda refills is so 1992.   Avoid this place."}
{"text":"If I can give this restaurant zero stars I would. I sat at the speaker in the drive-through window for five minutes without even being told Haley please wait or I'll be with you just a moment. I ended up driving off without even having anyone acknowledge my existence. This is not the first time this is happened at this Wendy's. However it will be the last is I refused to eat here again."}
{"text":"This restaraunt has from line employers who have visible tattoos.  Disgusting.  They do not care about professionalism or cleanliness of the employees."}
{"text":"On more than one occasion I have noticed that the employees at this restaurant had visible tattoos showing from underneath their sloppily worn uniforms.  They obviously do not screen their employees, and they hire previous felons and other types of low life's with tattoos.  Beware... Your credit card info may be stolen to pay for their next tattoo at some sleazy tattoo parlor. Also their chili is usually watered down."}
{"text":"Wendy's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years.  They kept the soda machine behind the counter, and their slow counter service discourages people for waiting for refills.    And they save money that way.  Well, many Wendy's have been outfitted with modern soda machines in the lobby.  This Wendy's has been refreshed, but for NOT have the new soda machines.  So if you are thirsty and there is a line at the ordering counter, prepare to wait forever or to give up and leave.   Any Wendy's where i have to wait behind old blue hairs counting out exact change to pay for their senior coffees gets a low rating.  It's fast food... I want things fast!  Interior is nice otherwise.  Chili is under filled...."}
{"text":"As with most Wendy's, this one was busy and got the food to you.  I went at lunch, and most of the workers were very on top of their game.  Of course, the woman behind the counter made my name totally wrong because she couldn't read my debit card... I was right there, ask me my name.  Anyway, other than that it was great."}
{"text":"Amazing how fast they got a bus load through and everything was right.  I don't really eat at fast food joints, but this Wendy's was good.  Fairly clean, nice people working, and fast service.  What else do you want?"}
{"text":"Not bad. The drive thru menu sign could use an upgrade. It's old and in disrepair, though it does set the tone well for things to come. I don't get excited over Wendy's. It's unexotic and bland. Kind of like the college girlfriend prude you had for a month, until you realized how boring she was. Ketchup is the most flavor you're going to experience here, but it's pretty good anyway."}
{"text":"I don't usually rate fast-food chains on Yelp!  But I wanted to go out of my way for these guys and publish a public review. This is my fav Wendy's Restaurant so far.   The staff are very chill and nice people. They are very generous with the toppings and always hook me up nicely with the freshest products on hand. I am pleased to come here and walk away with a tasty meal at a great price.   Thanks guys, keep it up! :)"}
{"text":"Absolute worst Wendy's I've ever been to. Drive through is insanely slow. I've left the line 8 out of 10 times because it just does not move. It is ALWAYS bad. I know only stop when it's late and I'm super hungry and forget about how slow it is. Day or night, it takes a year to get your food. \"Fast\" food is not a concept the employees at this particular Wendy's are familiar with. It's not worth waiting 45 minutes for a junior bacon cheeseburger. You'll waste more money on the gas you use waiting in line than is worth spending at this useless restaurant. Something needs to change. The last time I was there, I was waiting in a huge drive through line while employees fooled around inside the (closed) restaurant laughing with friends, fake kicking them out while they took videos of each other and the line built up onto 40th Street. Ridiculous. I am all for raising the minimum wage, but not for the employees at this resultant, because they literally do work and seem to have no competent management. I can't believe I'm ranting about a Wendy's, but it is truly aggravating that the only place close by for fast food is so unbelievably awful."}
{"text":"Just when I thought McDonald's had poor customer service in the drive thru, this Wendy's location is worse. They don't bother to say thank you, your welcome, or have a nice day. Literally takes 2 seconds. On top of that, they all look depressed working there. Like damn, don't take that attitude with you to work. I used to work fast food so I get it, but I never gave a shitty attitude to any customer. Oh well."}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!!!!! I ordered a double HAMBURGER with ONLY MUSTARD AND ONIONS!!!! When I got it, it had cheese on it. I told the guy, I said NO CHEESE JUST ONIONS AND MUSTARD. He said they usually come with cheese. I said that's fine but I ordered mine with NO CHEESE!!! All he could say was they usually come with cheese!!!! These are the people who want $15/hr. Really? No way!!!  Stay away!! If they can't get easy stuff like that right imagine what they are doing to the other things!!!!"}
{"text":"Here's what I got to say: I received my food, but my friend who was with me waited half an hour. The guy at the counter said he gave my friend's food away. When something was said to the manager,  the guy behind the counter denied it, and started speaking in Spanish to the manager, not realizing we could understand him. He was talking about how dumb he thought we were until he found out we knew what he was saying. When we got the food, finally, he was still making fun of us, so it was probably spit in."}
{"text":"I'm not necessarily a Wendy's expert although I've eaten at quite a few. Sometimes it's just convenient to hit the drive thru in order to save time and grab something on the go. So I'm not without some credibility here.  That said, I think this location is near the BOTTOM of all Wendy's I've tried over the years. Bottom. Why? Well, despite that it's in a premium location, the service, convenience, and food quality are subpar. The drive thru is flat out dangerous. Not just with Waterworks Mall traffic coming in and out but the drive thru window is jammed in the corner of a tight, very crowded parking lot making placing your order a challenge.   Worse still is the pay station on the next corner and an incredibly tight turn to the pickup window. I'm sure a lot of people have scraped the crap out of their cars just navigating the turn. Wouldn't that just tick you off knowing you cost yourself hundreds of dollars in body shop repair by getting a $.99 burger? Whoa! And if that wasn't bad enough, the food has been cold at times. Wendy's? Cold food? What's going on???? Yep, cold nuggets, cold burger, cold chicken sandwich - or at the very least, luke warm.  It's decent when it's hot -  but I can assure you that cold takes it down quite a few notches. Try to avoid this location. I do."}
{"text":"This place was a joke. The staff at the time didn't have it together. They were completely unorganized. I think I wouldn't have minded it too much (since it is just a fast good joint) but what made it worse was the hair that I found in my food and the chicken was burnt to a crisp!"}
{"text":"I went Saturday even, extremely hungry and excited to try the new pretzel burger..my bun was burnt:( was very upset. way over priced also"}
{"text":"Wendy's..... not my top pick for a fast food joint, but their drive thru is pretty fast! Drove to Wendy's, ordered, paid, received, drove back to work and was back within 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"So me and the Mr are knee deep in guest room remodeling. So tonight we were going to have Bo Kho (Beef Stew, Vietnamese Style) but I fell asleep and didn't get it started in time to eat at a decent hour.   So on our way back from (another) trip to Home Depot we decided just to grab a burger. Now mind you I haven't eaten fast food for years.. I remember Wendy's having a delicious juicy burger, piping hot and yummy! Well to my surprise when I found that they didn't have my 1/4 double stack any longer but some little piece of shit called a Burger Buster, or something.. Well it sure the hell was, they busted the burger right out of that shit.. it wasn't burger but perhaps some dirt and belly button lint held together with some sort of emulsifier. This thing wasn't juicy nor tasty.. just cheap and nasty!  You know what? Someone should punch that little red head bitch in the face!"}
{"text":"Wendy's has come up in the past couple decades.  I remember them for their dollar menu spicy chicken nuggets and Jr. Bacon cheeseburger.  I know they're proud of their burgers.  And their chocolate frostiiieees!  These days they've got heavy competition.  In Las Vegas they have plenty competition.  Still I find myself getting a full combo meal here more often than Burger King or McDonald's, or even Carl's Jr.  What gives?  Who wins?  I'd have to see their financial reports... But I know for my preference, they have a good selection for chicken.  And they chimed in on the green tea craze!  Blueberry pineapple - pretty good.  Their medium beverage looks like a large.  I couldn't finish it.  Freeze it and consume later :)  And their fries with freckles - yeah there are freckles look closer.  They look like thin cut wedges cuz the potato skins are still on them.  Regardless; mayo please!  They advertise never frozen and quality is their recipe.  Their big honchos should know this Wendy's location is living up to their standards.  I like how neatly my order comes wrapped in its paper foil wrapper.  That already speaks of their quality!"}
{"text":"fast & quick food is usually hot & ready, employees all seem pretty nice!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here a few weeks ago and received a completely burned to a crisp burger. This burger cost around 7 dollars. I was pretty annoyed because we don't always eat fast food but we decided to this night because we we're running short on time. By the time I had went through the drive through and got home (and now had the need to return my food) I could have just made it on my own.   What is really bad through is that I attempted to contact Wendy's and when they finally responded to me they promised me that someone from the restaurant would be contacting me.   Its been about 3 weeks not and I have contacted them back multiple times and no one from this restaurant can even bother to send me an email saying \"Hey we're sorry we looked into it and took care of it.\"   Really poor service I do not plan to eat here again."}
{"text":"I had some shopping to do in the walmart located in the same shopping plaza , so decided before had to grab some lunch as I was headed in I noticed a very thin and elderly homeless man who looked like he could use some food. So I asked him if he would like to have lunch with me, he took me up on my offer. I went inside and spoke to a female manager before coming to just make sure it was ok she said it would be fine if he had lunch with me in their store.  As we went in and began to place a order , the man behind the counter who said he was a manager advised me we were NOT welcome to stay they would take my money but \"HIS KIND\" is not welcome here. I asked him what he meant by his kind and he advised me the dirty and homeless. I advised him I had cleared it already with the other manager and we were going to sit down and have our lunch. He advised me that he would call the police if the homeless gentleman stayed . At this point my blood was boiling at how rude and unkind this store manager and staff were.  I advised him that I think personally he was a dick and that someday If he ever needed a meal or a hand up that he got the exact kind of help he deserved. I will be calling corporate."}
{"text":"Out of all the fast food hamburger places Wendys has the best hamburgers. They actually taste like what a hamburger is supposed to. Their chili is excellent especially with onions and cheese! Never had a problem with the drive thru, always nice and our order always correct."}
{"text":"So first when pulling in I couldn't even tell if they were open or not. All lights outside has been turned off including the marquee. When ordering I had to repeat my self multiple times and there was constantly loud noises over the intercom. I had ordered baconator fries but when I got home (not even 5 mins away) they were cold fries with big chunks of unmelted white cheese with not even half a strip of bacon squished in the side. Not the way I remember baconator fries.. Just an overall unhappy experience"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken pecan salad disappointing that they don't have lemon garlic dressing  friendly staff"}
{"text":"The service last night was absolutely terrible. We went through the drive thru and didn't get acknowledged for over 5 minutes then pulled up to the window thinking the speaker wasn't working and waited behind a car for at least another 5 minutes. We then got a snarky attitude at how busy they were (definitely not that busy, one person in front of me) when I told them I hadn't ordered because no one said anything through the speaker. The worker then shut the window and walked away without taking an order so I just drove away. Will definitely never eat (or try to eat) here again!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a whirl again and the service was horrible and disorganized for lunch. Employees spilling drinks all over the counter, employees moving the food pick up all over the place. Mass confusion and disarray.   I feel lucky I got my order right and food right.   Got the Ultimate Chicken Grill with a small chili.  Maybe they were having a bad day. But I won't be back here for a while."}
{"text":"So this Wendy's seems to have had a change in management and attitude. Much friendlier then ever. There was a time I wouldn't step foot n here. Same food but much better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Again, I don't eat fast food often--but when your job is to get a simple order right through a drive-thru, I expect you to do that.   Until you're administering brain surgery through a drive thru, it's unacceptable that you cannot listen to what someone tells you, get those things into a bag and hand them to another person. Simple human skills.   This location has repeatedly failed. Hire people who know how to listen to orders. The end."}
{"text":"We ordered $20 worth of food in the drive thru, waited 15 minutes parked in the front of the store for it, then had to wait another 10 minutes for a missing piece of our order. The entire time, we could see the employees just wandering through the store, doing what looked like nothing. Certainly not making our food! It was late at night, and it wasn't busy at all. We won't ever return here. They call it \"fast\" food for a reason."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever and worst manager Cindy!!! Missing some of my order and all of my food was cold when I got home and I live 5 miles away. I called to Speak to the manger (Cindy) who was very rude!!! Who called me a liar and said she bagged all of my food. I said excuse me and she responded OMG!!!!! I told her I will call her GM Maryann tomorrow."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick meal With my youngest daughter to grab a bite to eat an spend sometime with her as well. When we got here service was very inadequate to say the least. Cashier wasn't so courteous an come to find out she said she was the manager. Issue was I ordered the 4 for $4 for both me and her she asked my daughter what kind of drink she wanted an my kid let her know it was for me an that she wanted the same thing also. She then began to take my money and end the transaction. After she offers my change from a $20 bill to my daughter an I just put my hand out for it. Ok. We then began to order in an go get the drinks. My daughter saw cookies for 99cent if added onto the combo so I gave her enough for me and her to have one. The manager told her she couldn't do it for her an I had to basically say look this is her day off school an we just stopped in to eat that's all an can she just do it for my daughter or I'll just pay full price. She refused to an said she couldn't do it. So have to give the customer service there 0 but since I frequent the  drivethru an didn't have this issue I still gave them 2stars overall. Find another if planning to eat inside."}
{"text":"20 min drive through wait with 4 cars in line.  Left and went somewhere else.  Never again.  It's happened 2 times .  You call that fast food ?  I've seen grass grow faster."}
{"text":"When you walk inside the place looks extremely outdated nothing like some of the other Wendy's restaurants. Aside from the cosmetic part I do agree with a lot of the other reviews. The staff indeed isn't the friendliest,  but the food is like any other Wendy's restaurant."}
{"text":"Slow disorganized and extremely rude employees.  Absolutely the worst Wendy's in the Las Vegas area.  Not only are they rude as hell, I knowledgeable of products, they argue out loud with each other and customers."}
{"text":"I go to this Wendy's location because my wife loves winners, but I digress. Customer service is good, the people are friendly, the portion sizes are wonkers, a small drink at Wendy's is a medium at McD's, their fries might not be as good, but they can definitely hold their own. Bacon deluxe burger is fantastic, their spicy chicken burger is legendary, and their Baconator has taken its 1 millionth life. Now your wondering, why so lackluster Wally, why only two stars, well I'll tell tell you John and Jane. Two things, One: the Asian sesame salad, I will never forgive Wendy's for taking that away. Two: the S'awesome sauce, again you take away something I loved, and held dear. When will you stop taking, Wendy's! When!? But all in all it's a solid, great fast food joint."}
{"text":"Standered Wendy's, fries were good tasted like they were cooked in fresh oil. The guy I front of me soda was a little watered down when said something they switch out the syrup and gave him a fresh one without argument. My burger was nothing to wright home about but this is a Wendy's not a 5 star Michelin rated restaurant. They have free wifi and the eat in area looked clean."}
{"text":"The staff here is so great and humorous! I had to wait forever for chicken nuggets but they threw in an extra nugget and they were nice and hot and well cooked. Don't know why I craved fast food, but next time I am sticking to a frosty."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I've ever been to. 20 minute wait in drive through, employees are super slow and not even friendly and not to mention all three times I've been to this location my order has been wrong. I will never return to this location."}
{"text":"Overal:l 2/5 This Wendy's is sadly in need of a remodel and update. In a convenient location like this -off an I-485 exit, and near a strip shopping mall area, this should be a busy restaurant. Nd one that an owner could keep current. Their inspection grade was 93.5  Dave Thomas would be embarrassed that this location has not been kept up to Wendy's usual standards.  Food;3/5 Food is usual good Wendy's fare Servers:3/5 pleasant and helpful. Bilingual (Spanish) available  while we were there  Facility: 2/5 Drink machine doesn't with so patrons have to request drinks and refills from the busy counter staff  The bathrooms are marginal -only one sink Adequate parking."}
{"text":"Went to this Wendy's this evening becuase my pregnant wife and 2 year old wanted a milkshake.  Ordered through the drive through. When they handed us the milkshake, there was whip cream on top. My wife asked could they remove it. The manager smirked at her. Stared us down with disgust the whole time. He spooned some off, then mixed in the rest. As he handed it to me, he stared me down with a grimacing look without a word. I asked was there a problem, he just kept staring and refused to respond.   We will never go back to this restaurant. If the manager(Jeff?) bald headed guy, fat, country high pitch tone, doesn't like managing a restaurant, he should be demoted to cleaning it. There are too many other good employees out there that would value that position if given the chance.  I encourage everyone to watch out for this guy, and report anything out of order!!!!"}
{"text":"Another bad experience! Hey Wendy's, when you put a tomato on a burger that's no bigger than a silver dollar and doesn't even cover half the burger put another tomato on it! If you care anything about serving a quality product then use a little common sense! This always seems to happen when I get my order to go because they know people won't bother driving back to complain!"}
{"text":"We had a bad experience here about 3 years ago. Today we decided to try it again and hope for improvement. Well we were disappointed again. The food was sloppy and the service was awful. The woman at the window which looked like a manager was rude and we waited 5 min for our 2 combo order. 5 minutes for food that was too messy to eat driving. I have had good visits to all other Wendy's. Just stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Will continue to come back to eat here. Always pleased with the service here. Keep it up."}
{"text":"This wendys has bad customer service and the cashier had no clue what she was doing and manager was not wven helping her , how in the hell you dont have a restroom key"}
{"text":"Dude, I have not eaten at a Wendy's restaurant in years.  I'm serious, I think the last time I ate at Wendy's I was drunk, it was 1am, and we were in that special state of inebriation when even gas station hot dogs taste like the best thing in the world.    So I can't say I even remember the last time I actually ate Wendy's and had an opinion about it.  Yesterday I was between home visits and it was 3pm and I had yet to eat anything for the day - so I pull through and order a #1 (single patty burger with two slices of cheese, onion, tomato, lettuce, pickle, mustard, ketchup) , a small fry, and a soda.    Still not sure if it had to do with me starving or if it really was just that good, but that was one of the best burgers and fries I have ever eaten.    My new fast food fix."}
{"text":"This Wendy's gets special recognition because there's nothing quite like people watching with a spicy chicken combo.  If people watching isn't your thing, this Wendy's has a large seating area with lots of space, but you should really people watch here.  Nothing else about this Wendy's is particularly special or noteworthy.  Standard fast food restaurant stuff."}
{"text":"Food and service was good, place was clean, but if you went there wanting to have a conversation with someone else, good luck, as the music is to loud.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I'm surprised the people who work here are able to dress themselves.  Never saw so much disorganization.  Sunday afternoon, nobody seemed to be in charge.  Took my order and money, and after a long time I asked whats going on, and they looked at the monitor and asked me to show my receipt.  The whole time 20 minutes, a drink and fries were sitting on the counter.  Turns out they were ours, so I told them give us something fresh.  People were walking out, and those that stayed couldnt believe their eyes.  Never again."}
{"text":"Listening skills need work. Order was placed, repeated, and correctly charged; shorted a small fry & didn't get my burger as ordered (wanted to add bacon and take off onion, didn't happen). Service was okay. Thus is not the first time our order has been messed up but it will be the last. #Wendys location just lost a customer."}
{"text":"To 10/9/17 at 11:50 am makes the 4th time I've been at this particular store in the past 3 weeks and 4 times the fries were barely warm. For a place as expensive and a place that is advertised to ALWAYS  have quality food is expect to have fries that are at least a little warm. The fries that Wendy's uses get particularly dry when they're not hot and that really sucks."}
{"text":"Avoid the Chardon Wendy's at all cost unless you want hair in your food, half filled soda cups and general incompetence. Had to go in to get new food made, given attitude galore from the bitch face girl manning the drive thru window."}
{"text":"What an odd and disappointing experience!  I simply asked the cashier to confirm the contents of the Monterey Ranch Crispy Chicken Sandwich (I wanted to make sure that it didn't have any bacon) and I got a snippy, sarcastic, and just plain rude tone from the cashier.  The food came out within a couple minutes, which probably accounts for the french fries being cold and stiff and the sandwiches having unmelted cheese.  I can't remember when I've ever had such a bad experience at a Wendy's, but by the look of some other reviews as well, it looks like it's best to treat this branch as a poor exception to the norm."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is actually a pretty nice location and they have great service.   Of all the Wendy's, that I have been to this location seems to take their time with your order. They smile when they speak to you and they always ask if there is anything else they can do for you. It's rare to see good customer service at a fast food location these days.   The inside seating is clean and smells fresh. If you're looking to eat fast food but still stay on the health side, I would always recommend Wendy's since they have substitutions for fries and a good number of choices for salads.   They definitely fit in with the rest of the Chandler establishments as well."}
{"text":"For an airport joint? Awesome! Good service, Quick. Hot. Fresh. Yummy. And cheap -- by Hawaii standards. Panini breakfast combos for two, maybe 12 bucks and some change. That was a nice surprise so early in the morning. It's refreshing not to be price gouged at an airport. Wish the same could be said for Honolulu International Airport."}
{"text":"Walked in at 2pm on a Saturday with a party of four. My order was a fish sandwich with double tarter, a broccoli and cheese potato and a natural lemonade. I saw them prepare a cheese and bacon potato. I told them I ordered brocolli and cheese. She informed me it would be 40 minutes for a potato. Yes. 40 minutes. I took the one they made. It would be a minute for my sandwich. They would bring it out to me. 8 minutes later I went to the counter. No sandwich. They gave it away at the drive thru but would make another in 10 minutes. Forget it.   Out of potatoes at 2pm?  Gave away my fish sandwich? Maybe the manager on duty needs to be older than 16 years old. From listening to the kitchen crew they didn't have a clue."}
{"text":"If only there were negative stars. I was 4th in line for 10 minutes today. By the time I was next in line I turned around and left your restaurant. Your drive-thru was backed up to the street. Your single cashier inside looked as though she would be more thrilled to have a root canal. Service was slow. 3 customers came in from the drive-thru with wrong or missing food. The gentleman in the assembly line would jump in to assist at the counter as your cashier moved back and forth at a snail's pace. One of his hands was still gloved. He used the ungloved hand on the register but rested his gloved hand on the top of the monitor. When he returned to the assembly line his same glove was used and you guessed it... no glove was ever placed on the other hand; hand to register to food. I left and I won't be back. Beautiful new restaurant. Poor management and staffing."}
{"text":"Probably one of my new favorite spots to go eat now :)  This place is amazing, so I know I eat alot of fast food so I think I'm fat lol, no but seriously the staff are amazing and very friendly, the guy christian helped us out magnificently and they were very fast even though there wasn't a line, we literally sat down and our food was ready 2 mins later, I would deffinently recommend this place to anyone, especially if you love Wendy's just as much as I do"}
{"text":"Wanted a burger and they told me they did not have any meat at 10:55AM, WHAT... VERY DISAPOINTED.  WENT TO MCD who had meat."}
{"text":"Don't park your car and expect it to be there when you come out after eating there.  They towed my car today because I did not eat in the restaurant.  Unfortuantly we did eat there and could not get out of the parking lot because of event across the street.  So we walked around the nuthouse01area for a bit came back and car was gone. Talked to manager who said we did not eat there and I showed receipt and was told that was I was not seen on some camera so I did not eat there.  Now have to wait until Monday to get my car.  Well thats it never eat here again.    Lost customer for ever Wendy'  Wish Dave were alive he would have treated customer much differently. Shame on Wendy's"}
{"text":"Went to first Wendy's on Elliott and they did not have any meat.  This one told me they were working on the previous order and I had to wait in the drive thru.  WHAT happened to customer service.... Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Would rate it zero stars if I could because this Wendy's sucks. Staff is unwelcoming, unfriendly& super slow!! They all look miserable and lookin like they hate life! Smile once in a while geez  Then the chicken nuggets were super dry& the burger too.. Wont be coming back here anymore"}
{"text":"If I have to eat fast food then I always choose Wendys. This location, however, is sooooo Super slow and their sandwiches are always too light on something- light on bacon or mayo etc. Employees are rude and when I went in the restaurant, the kitchen area seemed less sanitary than one might desire. From now on, I'll be heading to the Garfield branch."}
{"text":"I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and got this overcooked piece of fried? chicken. Ridiculous! Not only did they give me the wrong thing, they overcooked what they did give me!!  Oh yeah and the wait time! I forgot to mention that. It took forever to get that mess."}
{"text":"Threw up from Wendy's twice in one week.  Once in a year, okay.  Twice in one week, no more for me.  While the service was constantly slow, and the orders were sometimes wrong, I never thought that their incompetence was so severe that it would affect the actual quality of the food.  I was wrong.  BE CAREFUL PGH!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food. Not what Dave Thomas created or expected."}
{"text":"Seems they can only hit the mark in the morning or very early afternoon NEVER go to this location at night STRAIGHT GARBAGE SERVICE DoorDashed left instructions for how we wanted our burgers pretty straight forward no Tomato on the Jr Bacons and no tomato on the asiago chicken sandwich also no mustard or ketchup on the baconator mayo only pretty damn simple right? Apparently not they must not know how to read or they don't care too unbelievable waste of time and money 34$ for half assed food thanks Wendy's"}
{"text":"Been going here for 2 months and the food has been fresh 2 times out of like 20. The customer service has been abysmal but I don't fault them for that... just a \"hi give me your order, bye\" every single time. Whatever, I don't care it's fast food. Today was the final straw food-wise. The fries were salted to the point of inedible, I'm talking you could see a thick layer on each fry.. The Dr. Pepper was flat and tasted really old. The chicken nuggets were undercooked and floppy with a weird layer of grease on the top. Only thing that was somewhat edible but could only stomach 2.  Then comes the chicken sandwich where I lost it. The top bun looked disfigured and I didn't check the insides like an idiot. Once I took a bite it tasted FOUL, I instantly puked after chewing twice. For the past 10 minutes I've been dry-heaving over the toilet. Upon inspection after the entire ordeal, the bacon is purely black and broken up with no smell to it at all. The patty is soggy and smells like sweaty socks. I don't even understand how this is possible... Went at 11 AM so I'm betting I got a day old sandwich that was brewing with bacteria.  Disgusting. Shame on the employees."}
{"text":"I usually find myself here once a week and I'm always getting cold fry's with my drink jammed full of ice. I'm just going to stop trying, I thought Wendy's could do better than this. Greatly dissapointed."}
{"text":"Employment is shit don't work here, I saw the same manager try to fight two of his employees, the employees both looked underage and he seem like a wannabe cholo. Don't eat here they don't fill your drinks all the way and sometimes the managers don't wear gloves or serve undercooked food. All they care about is how fast an order goes out."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst Wendy's I've ever been to. We ordered 4 jr bacon cheeseburgers, fries and 2 drinks.   We roll up to the window, pay for our food and checked the bag to make sure everything was in there. We noticed the fries were missing so we told them. The cashier said, \"you didn't pay for fries,\" and sat there and stared. We then replied, \"well can we please order some fries?\" To which she replied, \"you will have to pay.\" Which  obviously we knew that.   We then pull away and decided to check our burgers and realized they gave us some wack cheeseburgers with no consistency. Some had pickles, some didn't, and it was thrown together.  We looked for the receipt and we didn't even get one so there was just no hope for this order. We paid $15 for those 4 sandwiches and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Right off the top take note: this location does not stay open past 10pm.   Location of this store is awkward. Making a left out of the lot can be impossible at times. Luckily the lot connects to the plaza it is next to.  Store is clean. Staff is ok. Why fast food places have you not figured out that if you put two registers next to each other and have a dedicated food pickup counter, it is more efficient than piling customers on top of each other? /rant  This location has one of the beverage dispensers that are next to impossible to understand if one is not proficient with technology (i.e. older adults). Otherwise it is pretty fun to make advanced combinations of soda.   Food is ok. Definitely better than the rivals who serve salty garbage."}
{"text":"For the third time in a row they have jacked up my order. I would be more understanding if the people working in the window were not English speaking, but this is insane!   I told the young man twice that my order wasn't correct (I order the same thing every week) and he still messed it up. Then the man who brought it to me didn't have the two drinks, and when I told him there was supposed to be a Coke as well, he handed me the lemonade and said he didn't have a Coke. Well, I can totally see he doesn't have a Coke...    AGAIN... Not a speaker of another language. I can be patient, they are at least TRYING to make a living.    Then he acted like it was a huge pain to go get the other drink!  Really!  I paid for it, and if I have to go in and talk to the manager someone is going to be finding a new job!  I don't have a problem calling corporate or the owner."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of going here for lunch today to kill time while waiting for our movie to start. We immediately notice that it smells but assume it's a stinky person so we proceed to order. Charleson is either new or just can't get it together. I order a cheeseburger kids meal with ketchup only. He says \"so a hamburger with only ketchup?\" I say noooo a cheeseburger with only ketchup. He tells me the kids burgers only have ketchup on them. So we order the rest of our food. I get the kids meals first. I get a cheeseburger with ketchup and mayo. I go up to the counter and tell him that he told me the kids cheesburgers only come with ketchup but this one has ketchup and mayo. He says he told them not to put mayo on it. I tell him again that he told me it only came with ketchup. He repeats that he told them not to put mayo on it and he doesn't know what happened. Our receipt does not show ketchup only. They remake the burger and while my kids are eating my husband and I continue to wait for our food....and wait...and wait. 12 minutes go by. Finally we get our food. The cheese on my chicken sandwich is not melted and ice cold. The bacon feels like it just came out of a fridge. My husbands was the same. So we waited 12 mins to get cold food. I go up to the counter and get a girl who speaks no english. She says \"Happy Mothers Day\" and walks away. Another lady comes over who barely speaks english and stares at me blankely. I tell her we just want a refund. She never apologizes, neither does Charleson. We finally get our refund and leave. The smell never got better and we realized it wasn't a person but the place. Between the smell, horrible food and horrible service, we will never visit this location again!!!"}
{"text":"Do not come here if you want to be acknowledged or served in any way , unless you are in the drive through where in theory they must move you along . I waiting in line behind one person who took five minutes to place her order , and then the person at the counter proceeded to ignore me for another five minutes as she fumbled behind the counter dropping utinsils on the floor , then cups on the floor - never quite accomplishing anything , and completely ignoring me until after five minutes of bumping into other employees and dropping things she held her finger up to me and said \"one second\". I said it's been ten minutes I'm waiting . She said \"I know we're busy\" I said there's no one else here besides me . She said \"we are taking care of the drive through\" I said ok . I took a good look at her and she looked and acted high. I decided I didn't want someone high taking my order and I left ."}
{"text":"Wow....can't believe I done it again. What you ask? Forget to review a place I have been to tons of times and right near my home. Well let me start with the infamous COKE FREESTYLE MACHINES......they are totally awesome. I mean imagine hundreds of different drink combinations to satisfy your thirst. My personal favorite is the PEACH Sprite and Strawberry Lemonade flavors......simply delicious. This location has been totally renovated and it has a superb modern look to it now. It is very clean....well lit..... and has an electric fireplace which adds a nice ambiance to the place. The staff is friendly and the service is great.....I Always receive my food very fast. If your in the neighborhood.....stop in and give this restaurant a try. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Well compared to the one near my apt. this one should probably get 5 stars....but the customer service for most Wendy's in the valley are at best decent. The people are rude at times....and they never seem to have enough staff especially during peak hours. This location is the best I have seen yet so if you really need Wendy's then I suggest trying this one. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't usually eat fast food. This place is anything but fast. Drive thru was packed so I came inside to order. 20 minutes later myself and 10 other people are still waiting for our orders. Seems VERY disorganized. Does not seem understaffed as 2 workers behind the counter are just standing there looking around."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Entire place was filthy. Bathrooms were nasty. No toilet paper. Tables were dirty. Trash can was turned around so you couldn't throw trash away and the other was over flowing. Ketchup dispenser was empty.... the white lady that took our order was sweet because she at least called me Hun."}
{"text":"The guy Miguel gives me one day old green tea & when I come back & i ask him to drink he told me to trash it & they making new one.They don't even know when they make this shit .i ask her manager she don't know fucking nothing.They don't donate this food for us we pay for it.So my question is that if we pay for food & you didn't get good quality of food it's not worth it to spending money there..Talkkng with girls focus on your work & make quality better"}
{"text":"Stopped by the drive-thru tonight about 9:30 and ordered 2 spicy chicken sandwiches. They were surprisingly busy at that hour so it took about 10 minutes to get my order. The drive-thru cashier apologized to me for the wait and was very polite. Anyway, my chicken sandwiches were absolutely delicious. Well worth the wait. :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are swearing off fast food for the new year and our experience at this location made that decision so easy. We ordered single with cheese burger meals while running holiday errands. Both burgers were literally COLD to the touch -- the buns felt like they had been refrigerated and the meat was cool. I turned around and went back and told them. They gave me a new burger at room temperature, or cooler. Huh??? We opened the burger within about 60 seconds of pulling away. Since we were rushing and hungry -- we stupidly ate our cold burgers. Later we both felt sick and made multiple trips to the bathroom. I'd stay away -- they clearly would be in violation of health codes six ways from Sunday had they been inspected today. That's just awful -- I always worry about folks who are ill or recovering from Chemo or something, or kids who are sick and their parents are trying to get them to eat anything they'll accept and then these lazy, careless owners and workers endanger them with poor food handling. We won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Neither self serve soda machine had coke in stock so that was the first issue, but the real kicker was letting the store manager know he had what appears to be a homeless man snoring in the dining area, and the manager doing nothing about it. This picture was taken 20 minutes after alerting the manager."}
{"text":"My husband recieved an mildewed potato. We told the staff. The manager was no where to be found! be CAREFUL!!!!! EEEKKKKK!!!! :-("}
{"text":"We went to the drive through this past Friday and we placed a pretty big order. It was 5 meals and 2 chilis. They asked us to pull around and they would bring our food out to us after we paid $50, which seemed like a lot. Never the less, we say there for about 15 minutes and when the girl came our she gave our food to the car next to us who came after us, we even asked her before she gave it to the wrong people to make sure she had the right car. But low and behold it took the other party a mo it's to get out and wave to us that they have them the wrong order. My husband went in to see if they were going to refund our money or make the food again. I went in after 10 minutes because we had already waited 24 minutes at this point. After another 10 minutes I see the Asian manager, Jocelyn I believe, throw all our food in the trash and start making our order again. While she is putting it together I see her taking the chicken nuggets and putting them in the box with Her BARE HANDS!! I was disgusted, I later asked her why she wasn't wearing gloves when touching our food and she said the only people who wear gloves are the sandwich makers. Ewwwww. Another 15 minutes she has the guy at the register come get the food and bring it to us I'm sure so she didn't have to talk to me because I did not look very pleased. But I asked to see her anyways. I asked what she was going to do to make up for their mistake and her response was \"I can give you your food.\" I did not expect anything crazy or really monetary at all but an apology would have been appropriate I believe. She is quite possibly the worst manager I have ever encountered. Never going back to this Wendy's or any other Wendy's. Don't go!!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in customers were coming in from drive through complaining that their orders were wrong. The staff seemed annoyed that they were being asked to fix it. The ketchup pumps were broken and the employees were agitated. Worst customer service ever. After about 15 minutes we asked where our food was and it hadnt even been started. The staff was arguing with each other instead of making food. When the food finaly came out it was luke warm and my bacon ranch fries were cold. They did replace my fries and the manager offered us free frosties when he could see i was visably agitated. I really shouldnt have eaten the food but i was so hungry i did and felt sick for hours after."}
{"text":"We ate here over the weekend, our food was really good.  The burger was cooked all the way through and the fries were fresh and hot!"}
{"text":"I giving them a 5 because they are so friendly. Thank you guys! It's Wendy's cmon that's always pretty good and makes it nicer when they show the care."}
{"text":"If you're reading this before visiting this location, then avoid it at all costs.  Go anywhere else to eat. Anywhere. A visit here can easily ruin the best of days. Snobby girl at the cash register, who was completely inconvenienced by my business, got my order wrong. Soda machine, which prides itself on giving you choices, only had Sprite Zero and Seagrams, so if that's your thing, you're in luck, here! Cold French fries to top it all off.  The only thing this location has going for it, is its cleanliness, hence the 2 stars.  I will never be back, though. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Overcharged me and didn't give me a receipt so I didn't know until I checked my account that night."}
{"text":"Worst quality control ever. I asked for no tomato, there was tomato. Asked for fresh food my fries were not fresh, my sandwich looked like someone smushed it with their hands repeatedly. Why dont you hire some people with decency and not just shithead off the street. Never gonna come to this Wendys again."}
{"text":"Ok so the food here is what you'd expect from a standard Wendy's. My 5 stars is for the customer service!! The ladies working here are awesome! They were so bubbly and fast, on a busy Friday afternoon. It's just refreshing when you encounter people who truly enjoy their job and genuinely love making people smile. I'll definitely be stopping by on my next layover!!"}
{"text":"Drive through was busy Wednesday evening at 9/23/15 at 715pm and as we drove up to collect our food from the 2nd drive through window, we were \"thrown our meal\" in its bag.  Luckily I caught it, but dang, why you need to be so rude?  Once we drove off and we saw that the fries didn't even fill the cup, I know now why they threw the bag  to get rid out us.  We love Wendy's fries and were sadly disappointed last night! :("}
{"text":"Unlike the mass food franchises would like to have you believe, not all locations are equal. This one on Kent Rd in Stow is always clean and always staffed with friendly people. Now you can only do so much for the food but the manager has his staff well trained and the quality of the food has been the best I've had at any Wendy's"}
{"text":"This location needs to hire people that can count to five (5). 1-2-3-4-5!  I am always cheated out of my 5th nugget at this location, without fail. (At least they are consistent, right?)   I am also pretty bummed that they changed their fries to the natural cut fries. Wendy's fries were always my favorite and now I have nothing to dip in my chocolate frosty. Wah!"}
{"text":"No customer service what so ever. Drove thru line was 12 deep and never moved after 5 minutes. I ended up leaving to go to another place for lunch."}
{"text":"The spicy chicken is da bomb!! First off, the chicken is just amazing. You get a large burger that actually fits in the bun they provide! It's not a little chicken nugget sized burger you have to eat your way through bun and lettuce to find.   I also tried the poutine which was pretty good too. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a fast food joint but it gets the job done.   If you're looking for a super meaty burger, the baconator is also worth a try!"}
{"text":"Went to go get a berry chicken salad. I can't have feta cheese due to being pregnant. After getting to the window I was told \"we can't make the salads without feta bc they're pre made.\" I was just able to get one without feta a few days ago without a problem. & the salads are advertised as \"fresh made salads\". You would think that meant they're not pre made. It's just a little upsetting when things aren't consistent & im sure they were being lazy. I asked for my money back."}
{"text":"This is literally the WORST fast food restaurant I've ever been to and it has nothing to do with the food.  I like Wendy's food, prices, etc.  But the people that work at this location haven't a single clue what they're doing.  I don't know why I continue to go here except that its a half block away from my house and sometimes I want something like Wendy's instead of the other fast food stuff.  But after this (my 3rd time) I can't do it anymore.  I went in and there was 1 person in front of me and it literally took them 10 minutes to get to the lady in front of me because they were still trying to figure out what to do with the last order.  Every time I've been in there it has taken me at least 15 just to get my order taken and its never been busy.  The people are absolutely clueless!   If you want Wendy's I suggest finding another location because the people that work at this location are so mind-numbingly unintelligent that it kills the whole taste of the food."}
{"text":"Ita ok I don't like the manager on the weekday nights though she has a bad attitude and she told her employees to not call her name then insulted ones mom right infront of me"}
{"text":"Dave's Big and Juicy was a hidden gem. I spent most my life getting a baconator, but a few years back I started asking to hold the bacon. Randomly tried a #3 and its my go to ever since"}
{"text":"Went over here for a late night dinner. I went through the drive-thru. Service was pretty quick for a regular large spicy chicken sandwich. No issues with the drive thru. Payment was quick and easy. They had the sandwich done in about 2 to 3 minutes.  Quality:  Spicy chicken sandwich wasn't as good as some other Wendy places (but it did take me 5 minutes to drive home before I actually ate the sandwich.) It could have been more crispier, but maybe the drive in the wrapping made it less crispy.   Taste was okay, probably would be better if you ate it inside.  The cashier was okay. Nothing much was said.  Since this is the closest Wendy from my location, would go back if I'm lazy to cook at home. Otherwise, may go to a different Wendy (but that is less likely to happen, as I was just cook at home.)  Did not get the Fries. Can't comment on that."}
{"text":"I'm a BIG chocolate Frosty fan, they totally remind me of frozen malts when I was a kid. I hit this location at least once a week sometimes twice. Since this store was remodeled they have really stepped up there customer service game. Works are way more friendly than they were before the remodel. Way to shake things up Wendy's!!!!"}
{"text":"Where's the beef...?  I used to like Wendys. It was my go to for fast food. Everything just seems to be ok now. Nothing jumps out to remind me to eat here again.   1/4lb burger (before cooking) is now the size of a small JR burger and the JR burgers might as well be vegan. Seriously there was a spot on the bun where the meat should be. LOL  The Chili was great, the side salads were good.   I think I am over fast food."}
{"text":"The service is disrespectful and disgusting. They didn't listen to a word I said and got our order wrong. The staff does not listen and do not care about anything but giggling with one another. Avoid this location, theres plenty of other places around that are way better and the staff will actually treat you like a person. I wish I could give them zero stars."}
{"text":"We came from out of town & this was the only thing closest to our hotel that was open late. So upon arrival to the restaurant drive thru the woman over the speaker was very rude and snippy. Received our orders and they messed up every single one of them. Plan on calling it in, but the way this place is ran I highly doubt anything will get done about it"}
{"text":"This is the worst wendys i have ever been to in my LIFE, food is ussally sloppy and kinda cold, there is a older pale woman who works the drive threw who is very rude and ive been there couple times she is always in abad mood and rude to everyone, She gets upset when i asked for 2 ketchups she told me last time that the new ketchup packs are 3 in 1, so i told her i understand i want 2 of those she looked at me and put 1 in the bag and closed the window.. so i waited there honking my horn finally someone else came up and gave me my damn ketchup, i tried to contact headquaters on this lady she is the reason why wendys lost my buisness, on top of all that one day i was in the drive threw one of the workers was by the trashcan taking a piss in broad daylight.. cant even imagine what they do behind closed doors"}
{"text":"Had a very nice lunch break here today. I enjoyed the new Coke freestyle machine with my chili . They have a new pulled pork line out. My lunch date got the fries with BBQ pulled pork and she said it was very good and would get it again. Restaurant was clean and the team seemed to work really well to get the orders out quickly."}
{"text":"When I pulled into the drive thru there was car at the window, one behind that car, and one at the speaker to order, and then me. The woman in front of me waited nearly three minutes before someone took her order. Then we waited another SIX minutes before the car at the window left. I had to wait to order but not quite as long as the lady in front of me. The car in front of her waited about 3-4 minutes to get his food. The lady in front of me waited nearly 5 and she was handed one drink and a small bag and then had to honk the horn for someone to come back because the forgot a straw or ketchup or something small. Fortunately mine was ready but they gave me the wrong size drink. I ordered a large and they gave me a small. When I questioned it I was \"informed\" that \"she rang you up for a small you'll have to pay the difference.\"  By this time I had been in the drive thru over 15 minutes and decided it might take another 8 minutes to get the correct size drink. To top it off the curbs at the exit are not well marked on the passenger side and do not easily accommodate large vehicles. This has to have the slowest and worst Wendy's experience I've ever had. I definitely do not recommend this location. Go to Popeye's next door or Jack in the Box nearby."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever.  Wait times are horrendous.  After waiting more than 10 minutes with only two cars in front of me, no apology or comment from any workers regarding the wait.  Don't know why I ever stop here.  Last time for me."}
{"text":"Currently hiring. Has the best day day shift but needs better night shift. food is done fresh and hot. Employees are very good about prices and sizes of things.. Needs a lot of high school students. Make sure all food is fresh. Had a extremely dry chicken sandwich. But I got a bigger sandwich...And was offered a free large frosty and a large drink when I had bought a small combo.. With the 4 for 4. I got asked if I wanted regular nuggets  or spicy and Crispy BLT or Jr. bacon Cheese.  Although I had gotten the wrong sandwich and went to get fixed. I then had a hard crispy sandwich. I complained to Erin to get a large sandwich which I got for free. She took my Unhappiness to heart.. I would defiantly go back some time soon. Loved the Cashier.."}
{"text":"Food was fast and fresh! Plus everything was actually there and correct which is rare nowadays with fast food restaurants it seems."}
{"text":"People here don't really seem to like their job. It's ok, I probably wouldn't like my job much either. But still, even if you hate your job, the customer shouldn't be able to see it so obviously.   Service was really fast, though. Food tasted alright.  Not much else to say, lol. Sorry."}
{"text":"Remodel is definitely worth coming in. 2 big screen TV's. Simulated fireplace. New furniture."}
{"text":"Eric, who was working the drive thorough window, was so professional and helpful. He made grabbing a late dinner on the way home from the airport easy and convenient."}
{"text":"Verdict: When I went to the Wendy's without... salads, of all things.  I hope it was just that one time because there was a serious salad shortage going on here. Finding greens in an airport can be tough so maybe someone said \"jackpot!\" and stocked up. All I know is, it wasn't even noon yet and they'd already sold out of just about every salad on the menu. There are like six types plus the house variety too.  Oh well. Brace for sodium intake. Got the chili, grilled chicken go wrap, and a baked potato. Pretty sure I got the last chili too. The lunch crowd was going do be displeased if this team didn't get some reinforcements STAT.  What can I say about the food? It's a Wendy's at an airport. No place to sit so you're on your own there. They do have some of the most reasonable pricing for food in that airport so that's something. The food isn't bad. I've had far worse at an airport.   It's mostly the lack of food and any kind of selection that drives the rating. Took a few minutes but I eventually stumbled on enough menu items they had available."}
{"text":"The food was overall good but they did put way too much cheese and sauce on my burger, although the Asian Salad was spicy but delicious. I went to use the restroom and wash my hands but I ended up doing neither. the bathroom had 2 stalls but no doors on the stalls. so if you were to walk in you could see someone using the restroom. when I tried to wash my hands they didn't have any soap and they didn't even have a bag that had run out of soap in the dispenser. if you really think about it you realize that the employees are unable to completely was their hands before handling your food. Therefore creating a ginormous health hazard to both themselves and the costumers. I would not go here if you are looking for a clean place to eat or germ free food."}
{"text":"Typical Un Toronto Like - Good Food and Fair Prices and FRIENDLY  SERVICE - How unusual!!!! about a billion restaurants here can take some pointers from Wendy's on customer service.  Is it that hard to say please , thank you and hello?!?!?!?!? Such a shame for the Cutural Center of the World Toronto can use types from Wendy's - Hey FYI your not New York!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never come across a friendlier staff at a fast food restaurant. I saw the manger walking the floor cleaning tables asking people if they were enjoying their lunches. He even offered a little girl a free frosty! Great job!!"}
{"text":"I've picked up food late at night through their drive thru and it's always been hot and fresh. Prob the best Wendy's in the area. No complaints."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences of my life. First the person taking my order couldn't seem to comprehend simple English or something making me repeat myself multiple times before finally getting it right. Second I decided to check my bags considering the previous incompetence and before even receiving my bag of food they forgot my frosty. When I told her she had forgotten it I got questioned with a nasty attitude as if I was lying about it. Then as I was asking for butter and sour cream for my baked potato she was closing the window on me and again with a nasty attitude said \"it should be in there\" and of course it was not. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"$10.58 for a medium-sized chicken sandwich meal. Not very good, but one of the few places open at 2am on a Wednesday night :-("}
{"text":"We love Wendy's:) I wish the cheddar bacon fries were always on the menu, the Gouda fries lack flavor . Good consistent fast food :) quality! Customers who just get on here to complain bug me.... I like telling people what is done right and if it's not go in the building or call them so they can make it right with you, mistakes happen!"}
{"text":"What a joke. Sat in drive thru for 12 minutes. Ordered a #6 (sandwich) and a 10 piece nugget. I received .... an 8 piece nugget and SEVEN orders of fries. Live an hr away and best way to \"correct\" was to drive back or stop in and give managers name when Im back in town. And what? Get a refund? Or another sandwich? No thanks. Check your bag before leaving drive thru - make sure you are getting what you paid for."}
{"text":"The pretzel burger is bomb!! I am a big fan of the pretzel burger. Love it on a Sunday,ha!"}
{"text":"Pretzel burger is pretty darn good,minus bacon."}
{"text":"I know it seems like an oxymoron but check out the pics that I have uploaded and you will see what I mean. Wendy's is my favorite fast food among it's peers, McDonald's, BK, Arby's, Taco Bell and the like.  Here in AZ Wendy's has a pretty tasty breakfast menu and who can beat the Frosty's? So this location has recently gotten an extreme make over and my favorite addition is they now have 3 Coke Free Style machines. I love Peach Sprite so I know this will be my spot when I have a craving. They have free WiFi with comfy lounging chairs in the dining area near the fireplace, a flat screen TV above the fireplace and modern seating no more booths at this location. This location has also added fresh baked goods for your sweet tooth. All of this plus a 24 hour drive thru; this is a whole new Wendy's."}
{"text":"BLT salad (no bleu) is the goodness....with extra ranch of course..... And eating in a nice, clean and new restaurant is a plus!"}
{"text":"This location didn't give me the right order... it was missing a burger and now I'm halfway across town and not going to spend 30 minutes of driving to go back. Very VERY frustrating"}
{"text":"Don't expect to use the free Wi-Fi here. I work from home and this is the second time I've come in just to have a bit of an escape from my home and both times the Wi-Fi has been worthless. Out in the main area of the dining area it would not connect at all. I moved to the booth closest to the kitchen area and it connected with one bar but no internet. The kitchen layout is such that they can't see when a customer comes to the counter. You end up having to call someone out of the back and then it still takes them time to find who is actually running the register. I like Wendys and just wish there was another location somewhere close to me."}
{"text":"So I am definitely no a BIG fan of the red head. I was just raised to to follow weird creatures that were the underlings of a creepy clown. Last night though as we drove by my regular quickie, I made a fast stop at my local Wendy's.      One thing I have noticed is there have been a bit of changes. Some additions and subtractions. Wait you took away my frosty with MIX'INS!!!!!????? It was bad enough when they got rid of the cookie dough mix'in, but take them away all together? You just lost yourself 4$.      We arrived around 8pm. No line at the drive-thru which I love. I ordered a double baconator, 2 large fries, and a cheese baked potato. No I did not engulf all that food. My lovely wife got a fry and the potato. Here is the breakdown: Baconator- 11/13 cows. pretty dam good. I like bacon a little crunchier. The patties were nice and full, nice portion of bacon. My only question is this...When I ordered it with no Cheese and no mayo(if it came with it) he lady rang up  no cheese, add ketchup. Why???That confused me. My biggest quam was the lack of ketchup. I am pretty sure 1ml of ketchup is not enough. Luckily my kitchen is equipped for emergencies.  THE FRIES!- 85/100  %DV of sodium. I do not know about you but when I first had the new Sea Salt fries, I was very impressed. They are by far my favorite new fast food burger joint fries. Just do not tell that funny looking guy with the big feet. Did I mention  all the fries stayed home by the time I got home??? score!!! Baked potato- Yeah baked potato is pretty hard to screw up... So I give it score of mehh.. Not amazing but not great. They also shorted on the sour cream. I have worked in the food industry. They make a killing on practically everything they sell. Soda is like 99% profit when you order one. However they will go bankrupt if they give an adequate amount of condiments. WTF???      Overall, good experience and about 13$. Our meal was just what we needed to make it through the night. Wait, did I mention they did not wrap my burger in foil?? Another unwelcome surprised you red headed devil lady. Next time I go though I want to be like Harley from Epic Meal Time and order a TRIPLE!!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=7X_AqTuKBIA Next time my fellow Munchers!!!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location at 9:30pm on Sunday. They closed and locked the doors immediately after we entered. The food i ordered was \"unavailable\" so i settled for baconator fries. They were cold and the shredded cheese on them was not melted. My friends chili was ice cold. They were rude. No one had on hair nets or ponytails, just free flying hair everywhere. They proceeded to clean the floors and bathroom while we sat there. A man that ordered AFTER ME got his entire meal before i got my cold fries. We used to stop by this location all the time. I wont be back."}
{"text":"This was the worst time ever spent at a fast food place!! Service was the worst ever see. I think McDonald's has better service then Wendy's. Not only that my order was all wrong and food was cold. Never again!!"}
{"text":"As it is with all fast food places; there is a lake f vegetarian choices to be found.  This terminal only has one restaurant here and it's this Wendy's. I feel like there is a lack of options here besides the abundance of clothing shop stores and 'news papers stands'.  Having only one option here and not a healthy one is Little disappointing;  Come on Wendy's it's time to pick up your game."}
{"text":"If there was something way below one star I would gladly give it. My 5 year old grandson was anxious to go to Wendy's so on 1/2/15 we obliged and took him this location. The stored somewhat of a foul smell, butting grandparents we decided to stay. We sat up near the front window and for a while the smell was not so bad. We did identify the smell of raw sewage, and when we complained to a worker we were told they were working on the men's bathroom (they were not). They had just put an out of order sign on the door. After a few minutes of trying to endure this we asked to speak to the store manager, who eventually came out. He seemed surprised by our complaint, even though it was vile. They had screwed up two of our orders,which he offered to replace, but by that time we had lost our appetite, and thrown the food in the garbage. I asked repeatedly for the name of the store owner, which I was never given. I insisted the store should have been closed until the problem was resolved. Finally, begrudgingly, they gave me the name of the district manager, Dave Desz. He said he would check into it. It was obvious he didn't care at all, because if he had he might have asked for my phone number to tell me how it was resolved. Or, at the very least, offered to refund the cost of our lunch. Disgusting, and it should have been reported to the board of health."}
{"text":"Poor service in the drive thru. Employee is having conversations with people in line and can't concentrate on taking orders. Workers act as if its a chore to be there."}
{"text":"I give this Wendy's  4 stars Don't judge the quality due to the location. The food was hot and fresh and everything in my order was correct. The service was fast and not slow at all like some if the other Wendy's I have been to in the area. My burger even looked like the actual photo and not smashed buns. I gave it 4 stars because some of the tables should have been wiped off"}
{"text":"I don't have Wendy's in the US very often at all but back home (Toronto area) my local Wendy's is lightning fast, always fresh, and has never made a mistake - so they set the bar pretty high.   This location was very slow at the drive thru, which I was going to ding them for in the review until I saw several bags of food going into the vehicle ahead of me. Courtesy tip: if you have a massive order, go inside... there are other people in the world besides you!  So the food (a Jr. cheeseburger and fish sandwich) were hot and fresh and presented quickly (once the car ahead left) and the window guy was friendly and cheerful. I did see others scurrying about inside making up for lost time so good on 'em.   Good work all! Oh, and their fish sandwich is awesome. If you haven't tried it you should."}
{"text":"Very fast and reasonably friendly and thorough service. Food was hot and fresh.  Even at an off-peak time (my visit was 8:30 pm). Very well done folks!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I have ever seen. Not clean. They cannot get orders correct. Sandwiches look just thrown together . Awful service and management seems to not care."}
{"text":"Everytime i've been the service has been great, today i was short $6 on a meal, and they gave me it for free! They've always been really nice on other days. 5 stars"}
{"text":"I swung by one evening on my way who knows where (I drive big rigs). You guys were busy, pretty DAMN busy!! The store was clean and organised just the same! a nice thing to see considering some of the dining tragedies i get to see in my profession. You had 1 person that stood out of the group of hard working employees. Her name was Alyssa, and she kicked many butts! She was kind, thorough and proficient. She took my order and was clearly in a \"zone\". like a well oiled cog, she moved fluidly through the madness and still had the poise to ask if i needed extra napkins! To you Alyssa I say \"Bravo\"!! I look forward to going there again!"}
{"text":"The lack of outdoor garbage receptacles is kind of upsetting unless you like taking your empties with you and stinking up your car some more. Other than that this is a pretty solid location that hasn't let me down very often."}
{"text":"This place is very slow! The service here took 15-20 minutes to make a basic 4 for $4 meal! I'm pretty disappointed with this establishment!"}
{"text":"Food was good. But got my order wrong through the drive thru. I've been here multiple times but I think I'm gonna find another quick place too go too m or find another Wendy's"}
{"text":"I actually enjoyed my meal here. I ordered the bacon classic combo and it was great! This place has come a long way since I stopped eating Wendy's a few years ago... It used to be disgusting!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is one of my go to locations for a salad at lunch. Made a special trip to this location for a Spicy BBQ salad only to find out it had been discontinued by the corporate office. Bummer.   I wouldn't take my rating or the general rating. I'm just bummed. In general this location is worth 3-4"}
{"text":"I love Wendy's taco salad, however I've been to this location several times and ultimately every time I order my taco salad something that's supposed to come with it is missing 1st time it was the salsa, this time it's the tortilla chips this location needs to take the extra time to check the bag to make sure everything is in there before handing it out to customers most customers do not have time to return to the restaurant for missing items."}
{"text":"Fix your soda machine! I tried 3 drinks and they were gross and flat.   And the young man at the register looked like he wanted to die."}
{"text":"I am disappointed in the service and food I received at this Wendy's. I went through the drive thru today and when I pulled up the girl who took my order seemed extremely put out and so did the other girl who took my card and gave me my food. They were not very friendly at all, I know working at a fast food restaurant isn't always pleasant and I know everyone has bad days but the attitude and energy wasn't cool at all. I think the most frustrating thing is when I ordered the To-Go Grilled Chicken wrap and as soon as I pulled away I looked over at the bag and I could already see that the wrap was open and falling out and all over the bag! When I pulled out what was left of it I could see it wasn't even wrapped well to begin with, like they didn't even try. It just fell open and made a huge mess. The only reason I am giving them two stars is because the other item I ordered was fine (side salad, not hard to mess up). If I wanted a sad chicken wrap a  I would have just made one at home (at least there I wouldn't have to deal with bad attitudes)."}
{"text":"Please think again if you want to go to this Wendy's location. Its the worst Wendy's in that area and surrounding areas. Absolutely disgusting, messed up my entire order, got the wrong food, didn't get everything we ordered. And there was hair on one of the chicken sandwiches, a short blonde one. This place should be shut down. This doesn't even deserve 1 star, but its forcing me too."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick, cheap lunch. I order a kids cheeseburger meal and it came out quick and hot. The fries were fresh! However, the freestyle machine was almost out of everything and the trash cans were piled up with trash. I don't know if they were short staffed but someone needed to get the trash bc it wasn't appealing."}
{"text":"There's not too any Wendy's on this side of town so when I'm craving a Wendy's burger I'll go to this location.  It's like a previous helper said a lot of the locations are the same and the burgers taste the same as well.  I've been coming to this location for years on end.  Mainly through the drive through late at night.  I've eaten inside a few times and it was clean and the employees were nice and courteous.  It's pretty hard to mess up a salad unless they give you the wrong dressing that you ask you.    I'll definently go here in the future when I craving the Taste of Wendy's or one of their salads.  I love the fact that they stay open past midnight as well due to the fact that not many restaurants are open that late and serve fast food."}
{"text":"I tell you, I hardly stop for fast food here, and tonight I was once again reminded why. After a long day at work I was tired, so I stopped for chicken nuggets and fries for my grandson and a plain chicken sandwich for me. My mistake was not looking at the food until we got home five minutes later. It looked like it was cooked five hours ago! Hard and shrivelled, and the fries were cold. Come on, it's just not right. So, it went right in the trash, what a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Always get a good meal here. Burgers are awesome and normally it will be a fresh made burger..My personal favourite is the triple!! Just awesome!!"}
{"text":"Aw Wendys.. You get no love? Okay in everyones defense service is spotty. But c'mon. That frosty itself deserves atleast 2 stars :) (5 IMO)  Funny story. 1/1/14 @ 3am. We just left Southside & were driving around aimlessly looking for places to eat. At last we spot Wendys & a drive thru line wrapped around. We wait.. & wait & wait. A few cars leave & we move. & wait some more. Finally we decide to leave after realizing it'll take forever to get through the line. We drive past the window & boom.. It's dark & closed. We look at the Wendys sign which states they close at 6pm new years eve. So a line of 20 cars including us all had a dummy moment the very beginning of 2014, including our DD. haha :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend finally realized Wendy's has an awesome 4 for $4 deal. :)  I head to waterworks alot of stop by this wendys often. Our visit on Saturday was really nice. I wasnt sure if they were open (per google, they were closed) We stopped at the menu in the drive thru anyways and gave it a shot.   The gentleman working was so kind.. yes ma'am, no sir, ect. He was super kind. You dont see that too often nowadays"}
{"text":"I had a bad experience here.   A girl was very rude to me (you could just tell she didn't want to be there & huffed and puffed for no reason at all) so I was telling my boyfriend how I felt. He ended up saying something to the girl who started an arguing match.   The manager came along and kicked him out. After locking the door, the manager turned around and said \"does anyone have a gun i could borrow\" . Obviously he forgot that I was still there.   I told him that was very unprofessional and he should watch what he says with a room full of people.   I emailed corporate and talked to the district manager. I went back 5 months later (I'm sorry but i looove wendys burgers!) and the counter girls seemed more friendly. The idiot manager was still there though."}
{"text":"We stopped through the drive -thru last night after helping my sister move. It was midnight and thankfully something was open. I ordered nuggets fries and a frosty. My sister ordered the same and Bobby ordered two Jr. Bacon cheeseburgers. Well only one burger was in the bag (we found out halfway Down the road) Bobby said the other burger was dry and they forgot the mayo, & my sisters fries had no salt on them lso she says.. Mine were fine but I kept that to myself to avoid her eating some of mine. Typical older sibling.)  Anyways I don't normally review fast food that I've had bad experience at bc it happens often, but totally forgetting a burger is not cool.."}
{"text":"Despite my better judgement, I decided to give this location another shot because I was in the mood for a baked potato. Bad idea. Went through the drive thru and ordered 2 combos. Only one made it in the bag. Never again."}
{"text":"I came in here as I had not been in a while. Now I remember why. The manager on duty is yelling rather loudly at an employee about putting on his headset so she can talk to him. Well if she was any kind of manager she would have walked over and spoke to this person in a more professional manner and not screaming. It sort of reminded me of a showing of undercover boss on how some mangers think they can get away with treating team players disrespectful. I told another customer if I was that employee I think I would have walked out or asked to speak to her in the office. After speaking to a friend she said that was the right thing to do is to make these comments on yelp so other people will see that you can't be disrespectful to your coworkers or your team members. I am hoping that the District manager Miss Dalrymple will see this post on yelp and do something about it,  the sad part about it is nobody in the store did not  consider that I could've been either a undercover district manager or a Wendy's  shopper."}
{"text":"I had a chicken sandwich and almost died, was so sick. Something told me not to eat it, it was dark and flat so was the tomato and lettuce."}
{"text":"Very poor service.....  Cold food old fries not even what I ordered all around just shit...."}
{"text":"Has a huge tendency to be very slow and backed up. Waiting doe drink refills is crazy. Summer is not so bad but in winter with the snowbirds it is horrible.   Wendy's really needs to get more diet friendly meals and less fat in their so called healthy salads and things. This one is average"}
{"text":"I'm always a little leary of Wendy's. This isn't the Bethel Park location's fault, mind you, but there it is. I recently patronized thus location while having my vehicle serviced next door. I ordered the Double meal which consisted of a two-patty burger dressed with the typical mayo and ketchuo, lettuce and tomato. Also fried and an iced tea. The fries recieved were coated in salt. I had to wipe them off on a napkin to eat a few of them. Also, I got a replacement burger due to the original having not been cooked. Literally, it was ice cold and bloody. Like they didn't even place it on the grille at all. Be advised to check your burgers carefully before biting into them. The staff was quick to replace the sandwich with a fully cooked version, but ew."}
{"text":"The Wendy's website says \"open late till 2 am.\"  Went there at 1245. Lady in the drive thru said they close at one. They said \"we don't have ice cream and I'm not about to stand here and make chicken nuggets.\"  Your website is totally wrong and this lady was completely rude. \"I'm not about to stand here and make chicken nuggets.\" And you want $15 an hour? Your job is to make chicken nuggets.   You guys gotta figure it out. Having people like this as the face of your company is pathetic."}
{"text":"We were leaving out of terminal 2 to San Fran. This was one of the only places to eat and it was so disgusting. We got the number 1 breakfast sandwiches and they looked slapped together. The cheese was cold, egg overcooked, and bread was dry. We do not recommend!"}
{"text":"I respect Wendy's for getting on the slow food movement, but sometimes you want a burger in under 15 minutes.  If you're not that hungry and prefer to watch 5-10 employees hang out and check their phones through the drive-thru window, add four stars."}
{"text":"Worst wendy's ever.  All food cold and/or dry. No chili available.  Lots of food around here.  Keep driving"}
{"text":"Awful! Grade is very low. Of course I would have never ordered food if I realised it was almost a B! You never get sauce for nuggets. The food is not even wrapped properly most of the time it's just thrown in the bag. Fries are always hard and cold. I don't even know how they stay open."}
{"text":"Pull me up for \"hot\" fries in the drive through and when delivered to Car they were cool amd limp."}
{"text":"Just wanted a quick bit and got Cold fries, dirty floor, day old salads, dirt beverage station =bad dining experience."}
{"text":"We stopped by at about 5PM on Wednesday for dinner. My wife and I both ordered a single burger with baked potatoe and drink. The burgers were great, the drinks are Coke, now the baked potatoes, they were old, discolored and cold inside, very nasty. They appeared that they could have been even from the day before, not many places have baked potatoes but none would be better than bad ones. I would even wait the five minutes it takes to Nuke one rather than what we were served. One more chance and Wendy's will be off our radar screen."}
{"text":"I've watched this place sink further and further downhill in the 15 years I've been coming, and I've finally decided it's not worth coming back.  The only thing that has kept me coming as long as I have has been the food.  I rarely get a bad meal here.  What has gotten noticeably worse is the staff.  They manage to outdo themselves with each and every new hire.  My last and final visit, I approached the counter smiling, and my cashier, a young and snotty girl approached the register from the cooking area and sighed in my face.  She put her hands on the register and did not raise her eyes to even greet me.  I gave her the benefit of the doubt... I'd probably feel like killing myself too if I worked at Wendy's.  \"Hi!  This is gonna be for here today\", and she didn't say anything, or even click a button on the register.  So I said it again, and she shrugged a little, so I continued with my order.  I then made the mistake of handing her a gift card that had less than the total of the order left on it.  Her response: \"Ugh, hole on\".  She then left me at the register for about three minutes, giving me time to contemplate how I'd reached this point in my life, and why I continue to put up with such inconsiderate people.  She eventually returned, with her iPhone in hand, and had the calculator app open.  She looked at it and barked \"You owe me $7.40!\" (Never mind the fact that registers typically count money for you)  I was just surprised she had a voice box to be honest. I then handed over a credit card to cover the rest of the total she had pulled out of thin air, and she turned to her fellow employees and screamed \"Oh, how I do dis?!\"  What can you do at this point but shake your head in disbelief?  I filled out their pointless survey off the back of the receipt, never got a response, but it's worth noting that as of this review they had a 95.5 inspection rating.  Anyone that eats at Wendy's regularly knows that they cannot get lower than a 100 due to hiring \"Safe Serve\" certified employees, which automatically earns you a few free points.  Take that as you will, but if you consider the cashier to be on the same mental level as the cooks, you'll understand how you get such a comparatively low score."}
{"text":"It was 9:00pm on a Saturday when I decided to go to Wendy's. It took 30 minutes for a 4-piece spicy nugget order. Thanks for wasting my time Wendys :(  this Wendys also likes to turn the inside and outside lights off before closing time - to attract less customers, to do less work, and to appear closed for all of the hungry Americans."}
{"text":"I found dirt, a nasty lid w/extra dirt and a HUMAN HAIR inside my drink. Idk if I ticked this employee off or what but thank god it was a clear cup! Got a replacement for it, either way watch out for RAYMON when you're getting your drinks!"}
{"text":"I love this Wendy's. I have been coming here over the years and never had any problems. my order is always right and piping hot fresh.   The drive-thru is super speedy and the workers are always friendly.   I recently have become addicted to the chili cheese fries.   You can't beat there value menu with so many tasty options.  They regularly send coupons in the mail and all of them or worth using. I got a free spicy chicken sandwich with purchase of a small drink and fries and also I liked the coupon where I got a free chili cheese fries with any purchase. I ordered from the value menu that time and my total was just $2.12 for the fries and 2 sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru on Friday 09/04 for dinner for my family. I got 2 burgers, my daughter got kids meal chicken nuggets and my wife got the chili. In the middle of the night we all woke up throwing up all night long. How is it that we all get something different yet we are all sick to the point of throwing up. I will never goto this Wendy's again. What a way to spend your holiday weekend everyone throwing up from their food. Stay far away from this place unless you want to get sick."}
{"text":"WHY is it so difficult to get FRESH, HOT, FRIES and NUGGETS at this location???? Aren't the fryers on ALL DAY??? Isn't there STILL a five minute hold time???? Here's an idea.... How about dont make them until they're ordered! I'm SURE people ( which are paying customers) wouldn't mind waiting a few minutes for FRESH HOT FOOD. To HELL with your 3 minute drive thru time. Quality USED to be Wendy's PRIORITY regardless of location. The customer service is AWESOME, the staff is SUPER friendly, but it seems the ONLY \"Wendy's standard they adhere to is \"White, Red, and Green\" which if you didn't know is the order condiments and vegetables are loaded onto your burgers, and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Walked in on 12-12-17 at 9:05pm, carlos the manager  proceeded to tell me that they closed 5 minutes ago and I couldn't be helped so I exited the building, as I got in my car I watched  a group of kids enter the building and they procceded to get helped, and even more people came in as I left, I will not be returning until action is taken."}
{"text":"Okay, I know this is fast food, but man this Wendy's is always horrible. My first time there I took 1 minute to think about what I wanted to order, keep in mind there was no one behind me, the guy taking my order kept on repeating \"are you ready\" \"are you ready\" \"hello are you ready yet\" each time I said \"no still looking, I'll tell you when I'm ready\" he was rude with the response. & gave me the wrong food. The employees are always so rude, the chicken is always so hard and dry, and they ALWAYS forget items. Seriously every single time one or all of the things above happen and its ugh. Don't go to this Wendy's. Let's shut them down for the shit hole they are. Anger yelping right now. Hope this helped though :) don't go here"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered a meal and 6 nuggets. Got my meal at the window and they said thanks.  Waited. Came to the window asking for money ( obviously for the people behind me). Said I'm missing my 6 piece.  6 piece came with no sauce. Had to ask for BBQ.  Didn't get ketchup.  Decided not to ask.  Cause it seemed like a hassle for them...."}
{"text":"One of the better fast food places. Good for when you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Another classic Wendys location.  You know what you're getting when you go to Wendys but I got excited when I learnt of the new pretzel bun they were featuring. Save yourself some disappointment and don't bother.  Just another Wendys."}
{"text":"I come here because its close to my work. The last couple visits have been horrible but today tops it off. The Manager running drive through puts me on hold which was fine because i wasn't ready, when i was ready she seemed to be \"overwhelmed\" and kept cutting me off.I pull up to pay and instead of taking my money first she hands me the frosty and my drinks (hello i have the money in my hand, money should always be taken first) then tells me to pull up and wait...meanwhile its 105 outside,well there goes my frosty which is melted. I get back to work and no chili on my potato...okay whatever no big deal i go back and what do ya know I wait inside for 10 min until someone helps. All i hear is the female manager with the gold teeth being extremely rude to the cashier named Samuel, telling him \"how you an idiot?\" geez dude how many times do i have to tell you\" \"fucking listen\"  Completely uncalled for and i will be calling corporate to final a complaint for him. Treating people like that is uncalled for and YOU are whats wrong in this world"}
{"text":"This place is horribly slow. I've swung by a few times after work. Usually just to buy some fries or something small. But always one item. Each time it took 10-15 minutes. There's been times I've backed out of the drive through because the person on front of me was being out on hold for minutes at a time. One day I decided to swing by inside to see it it was any better. Nope, staff is so slow. Never going back."}
{"text":"My Wife and I ate lunch here yesterday. It was the busiest I have ever seen Wendy's. I got the 4 for 4 deal and I was happy. Would have given 5 stars if Wendy's would put in a self-serve drink station.  Went again yesterday, 1-28-18, and I was so happy to see they finally installed a self-serve drink station. So, true to my word, I am updating my review to 5 stars. All the food and the Frosty were very good. Staff was friendly and gave good customer service. Nice job local Wendy's!"}
{"text":"I feel bad that the only review is a one star, and though Ive only been here this one time, and it was at the drive thru, i thought id add that my service was good. The guy at the window spoke english and explained the difference between two burgers well. I got exactly what i ordered, it was a special burger too (plain), and it was fast. So Id give it four stars."}
{"text":"Rude service x2. I went through the drive thru, and my inlaws were behind me. Now, those people will annoy the bejesus out of anyone, including myself, but theres never any excuse for rude service. And thats what both of us got.   My transaction went like this: i pulled up to the drivethru and tried to place my order. The guy kept getting my order wrong - at the speaker. Suddenly the voice changed to a female one - with attitude. Then i pulled up to the window, where they THREW my food at me. I kid you not. So then i thought id better check the order. As i was doing so, an employee said, again with ATTITUDE, \"can i help you miss?\" I said \"just checking my order\", with a big smile, and pulled away. But not before i overheard a manager (in manager clothes) say \"just rush this line thru\".  I thought, how rude, then i parked and waited for my inlaws.   THEY pulled up to the window, my mother in law proceeded to order, and was told she \"sounds like a robot\". She replied \"maybe its your machine.\"  They then told her \"weve had this machine for years and have never had a problem.\" I couldnt BELIEVE this.   I looked back at an old check in i had here where the manager (bigset female with attitude galore) had a big attitude before and had said, within my earshot , \"get these people outta my drivethru!\"  Tell ya what, lady - it aint YOUR drivethru. And Ive been coming to thos wendys because its convenient (wait a minute. Getting into this locations a nightmare). I dont think im ever coming back.   And if you dont want attitude, abuse, the wrong order, or god knows what done to your food, Id recommend the same."}
{"text":"Decent service, decent food. I come here when in the area and have always thpught they were super fast & efficient. FAST food doesnt get much better than this!"}
{"text":"Charged for a #6 instead of a #1. Price difference $.60. I receive $.30 back. Thank you, unhappy manager."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 value size sodas...if you see the receipt they charged for one value size and one \"SM\" small size ....now I noticed right away but am I really going to fight over 0.40cents? Now I'm just going to rant and rave about how they are ripping their customers off instead. I took a picture of the receipt next to the drinks so people could see they are the same size. Usually this Wendy's treats me well. Anywhere I go I'm speaking my mind, bad or good. And this Wendy's is officially on the naughty list.  Update: gave me extra nuggets today. Earned one star back lol the guy just couldn't count. My two 6 pieces turned into 10 pieces ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"This Wendy's has surprised me. I don't know why I have had a cravings for Wendy's a couple times recently, but they did not let down. It's renovated, clean, friendly service, and fast. Nothing to complain about for fast food."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and have had nothing but good experiences. Always friendly and fast, and my food is always perfect. Not one issue so far."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  Depends on when you come.  Sometimes they aren't busy, so the staff dilly dally about.   I usually come here when I'm short on time, and like Jim B says, there's salad.  It's not often that you find green things on most fast food menus. For doing a work coffee run, it's great, because it's attached to a Tim's."}
{"text":"The bottom reviews are still very accurate in 2016/2017. Terrible service. Rude employees. Immature management. Trashy joint."}
{"text":"Sanatation rating a solid 98.5. I did get fast service and the food was hot. However I'm never a fan of the same person who took cash from the guy in front of me going to get my fries without gloves or washing their hands. Just a pet peeve of mine I guess."}
{"text":"So rude and ignorant accused a hard working man for using a fake bill so they didn't accept us so we went to Tim Hortons and they accepted it no problem management needs to learn how to tell the old bills if real are fake want to give 0 stars your lucky wendy really lucky"}
{"text":"I am sitting at your store now eating my lunch. I contacted the customer service number as well and reported the incident this is the Wendy's on rainbow Blvd off Charleston in Las Vegas Nevada narrow number 00004590.   Travis your employee there made an inappropriate  comment while the nice gentleman took my order and was explaining that I didn't want a bun to whoever was making my burger. Travis said verbatim \"well someone's on a diet\" loudly when I was online and other patrons were behind me. Well I have Celiac's disease (I am allergic to gluten which is wheat hence the no bun) after all the employees got their laughs he handed me my fries and didn't apologize after me voicing my concern. The manager never corrected him or apologized for the incident. Just now I am eating and the guy who took my order came over and apologized. I will not tolerate this behavior. Carl's Jr. From now on. Thank you Wendy's.  they want $15 dollars an hour to be rude? No that's insane."}
{"text":"Not bad for a fast food experience.  The place was dead empty when we went in with two tired toddlers about 7 on a Sunday night. The employees were friendly and helpful, the food was acceptable for what it was, it was a pretty good value pricewise. The kids were pretty good and scarfed down their food and we all enjoyed our tiny Frosties, which have gotten even tinier over the years but still just the right amount.  Everything looked pretty clean, at least before we hit.  I'd go back, and I don't say that about too many fast food places."}
{"text":"We just stopped in to get Frosties for the kids after the Aloha Festival because it was such a hot day. The lady behind the counter was nice and even told us about a coupon deal they had, buy a coupon book for $1 and get 5 free Frosty's. Since that was what we were after we bought it. We gave her three coupons to get the little Frosties for the kids and got small Frosties for us which were slightly bigger yet still plenty cheap at $1.29 each. I do think she made a mistake when she charged us though because I only see two subtractions for Frosties on the receipt even though we got 3 of them so we may have had to pay for one. However, the price was so cheap I'm not going to complain as long as she only took two coupons out of the book. If she took 3 coupons out of the book then we got shortchanged. ********  Checked with my daughter and she verified we used 3 coupons.  You'd think they could count to three. I read through the other reviews out of curiosity because there were so many that were just one star and lo and behold evidently getting orders wrong is an everyday occurrence with them. If I'd been by myself I probably would have thought to scan my receipt but since I was with my daughter and three grandchildren there was enough chaos going on that I didn't think to do it. So if you happen to read the reviews before you order, make sure your receipt is right."}
{"text":"I mostly don't do fast food and burgers but had an ice cream craving and remembered Wendy's has their dollar size Frosty.    I Yelp Wendy's and find this one is one just around the corner from where I'm staying. Perfect, methinks!  But when I drive over there I find they are MIA.  So sad.  I have no idea how long they've been gone but I'm SOL tonight."}
{"text":"I went to wendys twice in two days because of the $1 drink deal. The first time i went the lady dropped my drink holder and the drinks spilled all over! The second time she rushed me while i was ordering then when i got to the window she forgot my food just giving me only half my drinks and rushing me off. We asked for ketchup and ranch and didnt get that. They gave me a fork for my frosty! So annoyed the girl wasnt nice and just rushed me. Mind you there was nobody behind me!!!! Dont eat here."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve 1 star, to be honest. The worst Wendy's I've ever been to, with the rudest staff. Will never be back. Pure Garbage People"}
{"text":"I find it super unprofessional and rude for Dena the cashier with prison tattoos all over her face and neck to tell me that I ordered incorrectly. I asked for a number ten medium spicy nuggets. And she comes back with you didn't order that correctly you need to clarify if you're getting spicy first cause you just messed me up . Really!!??? Learn how to to do your job !!!! As a customer how do I know that's how your system works"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is close to my house.  It used to have great service and no issues, unfortunately the last few times I have gone the drive thru lady has been rude and my order is ALWAYS wrong.  Today was no exception! Ordered 2 combos today, baconator with diet coke and spicy chicken with no mayonnaise. I even politely had the them read the order back to make sure it was correct.  I was given a double cheeseburger with regular coke and the spicy chicken had mayonnaise, that coupled with the rude service was my last straw, I will no longer be going here. :-("}
{"text":"Seems like this location specializes in rude or non-caring workers.  I've been totally ignored at the window while the cashier just talked to his friend non-stop, basically throwing my change back at me.  I've had them rudely asked \"Didn't you read the sign??\" when their card machine was not working, but the sign had been poorly taped and fell off.  The food at least is usually mostly fresh, though on occasion they like to serve up cold/old fries.  I try to avoid this location."}
{"text":"Ordered a baconator combo with fries.  Pros  - Baconator is pretty decent (as a fast food burger) - Drink machine is the new gen kind with countless soda options... vanilla coke... hell yeah!  Cons  - Fries were extremely salty and thus... inedible. - Their cashier lines are a complete mess, not sure WTF was going on here, if you're coming or going. - Service was non-existent, some tables were dirty and left so during my entire 20 minute stay. (People forced to sit at dirty tables, nasty)."}
{"text":"Since when do fast-food places have outstanding customer service skills? Like many, I'm sure, just stopping by here for lunch while my car oil gets changed next door. Didn't expect much, but was pleasantly surprised at the level of attention to customers they have at this location. With a smile, referring to me by my name they politely assured me that my food is getting done fresh and will be ready in a few more minutes. And it was. Food. Of course it's fast food, so don't expect me to say this was the best meal of my life, however, it was pretty fresh and tasty for fast food. I'm surprised how they could get their chicken so perfectly juicy.  So 4 stars is just right for this spot.  Conclusion and future note to self and others: Do stop by for some food while Ted Wiens works on your car."}
{"text":"We just went through the drive up so can't comment on cleanliness inside. Drive through was fast and very friendly. The woman at the drive up window very very nice. Food was good and tasted fresh. I got a salad and it was fresh no brown spots or wilted greens. Fast, friendly, fresh. I will return."}
{"text":"Seemed like a dirty Wendys  Obviously food is always good, but i didnt like the feel of this place. Next time if i have to stop here ill just use the drive thru."}
{"text":"First time here in several years. The gal at the window literally said 0 words to me..even when I leaned out my window and said \"Thank you!\" TSK TSK....."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had (due to disappointment from el bravo a couple doors down).   TLDR - el bravo sneakily charged me $17 for the worst burrito I ever had.   I came to Wendy's, great service and friendly cashier, got my 10 pc nuggets, fries and diet sprite for $7 and it was fantastic. But actually, it was super hot and very fresh.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Such good food! I've been coming here since I was a kid and I've never once gotten sick from it. I can't even remember them ever messing up my order. Their food is always hot and fresh! The workers look clean and they are friendly. I highly recommend their chili, it's always hot and fresh"}
{"text":"This place is very nasty , hair was all over the drink machine , it's only 11:40am they just opened.. the worker told me \" what do you expect, you on Buckeye?!\" as if it was ok ?! I was highly upset with the service and cleanliness of this establishment... so what if it's in a urban area, that mean leave it dirty !????!?"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time in the past two years and I really liked their food.  But then I moved in with my fiancé and stopped going. Today, we stopped to grab some lunch and I was surprised at how dirty the place was. The tables were dirty.  The prices had been raised and I noticed that some of the food had been taken off the menu.  The spicy nuggets for example.  My fiancé took the order to our table and accidentally dropped the drinks that were placed on the edge of the tray and when he took them to the cashier she told him that she would take care of it to leave it on the counter. So we were really hungry.  Started eating, and I went back to the counter and asked about our drinks.  She had \"forgotten\" about them.  I used to love that place but now, not so much.  I don't know if I will return."}
{"text":"So-so service. Not always correct on orders and a bit slow. Wendy's has been trying to upgrade their menu, but I am still not impressed."}
{"text":"So you are a captive audience in an airport, beyond the security checkpoint.  This is a fast food restaurant.  A recipe for a bad experience.  Menu is pretty generic fast food.  Prices did not seem extreme.  Service was friendly.  Good choice if you crave fast food."}
{"text":"Was super impressed by the service I got at the drive thru today. Typically this location will not serve the Freestyle drink options at the drive they because the machine is in the lobby. When I ordered a Diet Cherry Coke at the drive thru the person on the speaker said that they only have regular Diet Coke. I was disappointed but expected that answer so I ordered the regular Diet Coke and drove to the window to pay. When I got to the window the cashier handed me the regular diet and as I was about to drive off the manager came running to the window and handed me a Cherry Diet Coke that he went all the way to the lobby machine to get for me. Little things like this make all the difference and I was so pleasantly surprised by the extra effort. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"This place's location makes it a hangout for St. Ignatius High School Students, which makes it busy during school days and sporting events.  Service is friendly and usually gets orders right.  I don't necessarily like Wendy's menu, but this is an OK place to stop."}
{"text":"I'm not a great fan of Wendy's menu, but this restaurant does well with service.  Generally friendly staff who get your order right.  Food generally served warm and fresh.  Good choice if you crave fast food."}
{"text":"I complain a lot. So the fact I give this place 5 stars means a lot. The cashiers need a pay raise because they are so helpful, especially the late night crew. Donnet was my host, and she was very helpful. She deserves a pay raise. Thank you for a great experience:)"}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's I've ever visited. If you go to the drive thru be prepared to wait no less than 20 minutes. Fortunately they have never messed up my order but the wait is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever!  Employees suck.  This used to be a decent one, not anymore...wow.  Gave one star because I couldn't give zero.  Find another place to go, keep driving, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Juice was watered down, chicken nuggets too greasy, and the fries Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Eh....it's Wendy's. Decent burger and a decent price. Nothing too fancy here. It's close by my work so it's nice for a drive home and to grab a burger. It's no in and out, but it's not bad. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered three 4 for $4's. 1 sandwich was to be plain, the other one was special and the last sandwich should've been made regularly. Instead of following directions they made every sandwich PLAIN. Fries were cold and not filled properly. Nuggets were cold and hard. Asked for honey mustard for all of the nuggets instead we received BBQ. What a waste of $15. With Moes opening up with a drive through option directly behind them I expect their business to decline dramatically."}
{"text":"Horrible experienced. Took me 30 minute to be able to get my food. Slow service, associates was very rude and make me feel unwelcome.   Recommending Franchisee owner and store manager to re-evaluate the associate performance because one or two bad apple will damage your business"}
{"text":"This is a crazy disorganized Wendy's. Admit that my family are regulars, but it's also a fun game to see what of our order did not make it into the bag, and what was added just for...FUN! Drinks are a game of what can you get that is kinda close to what you ordered, but still come short. The food is sometimes a bit overcooked. It's fast food, so you don't expect much. But getting the order right, well, that should be what they do okay at, especially at the Drive-Thru. (Oh, they might also argue with you there, too, especially if you confuse them by selecting something not common). Just check your order before you leave!"}
{"text":"Thank you Wendy's for helping me tonight! It meant a lot that you would be so kind and give great service!"}
{"text":"Never leave drive thru without checking your order. It could be simple order they will mess up. Didn't want to be that guy who got his food and held up the line so I left but as I was pulling out I peek inside  bag ok missing my nuggets now waiting in long line 12 am now my food is cold. But I will get my nuggets or die trying lol. Sleepy and hungry."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Wendy's I went to EVER! And tonight just confirm that.   I've been living in this side of town for 16 years and have been going to this Wendy's ever so often but within the last two years the service and quality has gone down the drain.   My husband decided to get Wendy's for tonight's dinner and I told him to get me the Pecan Apple salad. Everything looked good but as I was eating my fourth bite, I felt something sandy in my mouth so I immediately spit it out to see what it was and I was in shock to see that it was a BIG chunk of pure dirt! I was so disgusted I dogged into the bottom of the salad to find another chunk! Needless to say I will NEVER return back AGAIN.   Sad that I can give them one star still but if I could they deserve negative star."}
{"text":"I visited this Wendy's on 9/8/17 at noon. The kitchen was totally overwhelmed with the line of people: about 15 people waiting for their order and another 10 in line, not counting the drive-thru.  I ordered a Baconator, large fries, 6-piece nuggets, and a sweet tea. There were several errors in execution: the burger was the most greasy burger I've ever eaten, and it was cold. The fries were cold. The freestyle drink machines both ran out of ice and the staff was too swamped to fix it.  The best part of the meal was the honey mustard sauce.  When they call your name, it's a shrill squeal for relief. You sound like you're being summoned.  Verdict: won't come back to this Wendy's. One and done."}
{"text":"I came to Wendy's about 10 days ago and ordered a large Baconator combo with fries and a drink.   The fries were overcooked, and it took 10+ minutes to receive my order. My burger amd everything about the burger was cold.  Hopefully just an off day, as I've had consistently better experiences at other Wendy's establishments.  Review #215."}
{"text":"Would have preferred to leave feedback directly, but the order taker tossed my receipt - how convenient.  This place is garbage, I waited 20 minutes (with 3 people in front of me) to place my order, another 10 minutes for the cold, burnt food.  I get that fast food workers take zero pride in their jobs, but there was no accountability and complete chaos in the store.  It's always dirty, and the service is always bad, but this was exceptionally poor.  But of course, the owner is making their profits because of the location and could care less about having decent employees represent their business.  Shame on them."}
{"text":"This is the best Wendy's could develop for breakfast?  It made me long for a McDonald's.  Meal: Breakfast.  Ambiance: Filthy food court.  Crowd: Sweat pants everywhere.  Menu: American fast food.  Service: Contemptuous.  Food Ordered: Artisan egg sandwich, seasoned homestyle potatoes, and orange juice.  Food Quality: The \"artisan\" egg sandwich tasted like grease and bread.  The potatoes tasted like grease and spice.  Finally, the orange juice was revolting.      Value: Poor at half the price."}
{"text":"Whoever took over this location makes the food wrong. Their friers/ ovens are set to a wrong setting and the food is always horrible. Go elsewhere, please."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I have ever been to.  Drove Thru at Midnight, me and 4 other cars had to pull around to the front. I had to wait 17 minutes for a Baconator combo. Then when it finally came out, the worker forgot the fries and the Coke and put ketchup on the sandwich which I asked for without.  Are you fricken kidding me? WTF? Wonder why people laugh when anyone suggests Wendy's."}
{"text":"This Wendy's was recently remodeled. Its very nice, clean, and a lot fancier than a normal one. It has a cool looking gas fireplace, and TV. Some nice wood paneling and glass fixtures. They also have the computerized drink station, which i love, because it has sparkling water for us that don't really like to drink soda. They have a nice living room style seating are with big leather lounge chairs. The staff is friendly and takes your order by name. I come here for a quick lunch every now and then. When i don't feel like cooking, and have limited funds. Great place for a fast food restaurant. Just a little bit above the rest."}
{"text":"Great service and fresh food. The washrooms are clean . The dinning room is a little out dated but it's Wendy's. Free wifi and a lot of soda variety.   The food is hot and good.."}
{"text":"It is probably the dumbest thing in the world to rate a fast food restaurant but I just had to leave a comment about my experience just now. I ordered a No. 6, a JR Cheeseburger Deluxe and 6 piece nugget. I asked the kid in the window if I can wait for fresh fries and nuggets. He said it will be about 5 minutes. So, I waited. Food comes out like 7 min later and I see that I have only 4 nuggets. So, I go in and tell them. The man who saw me WAVING could not even come to counter... he was just like (mumbling) \"what\" -- basically. So I explain. He walks away and tells other people I need more nuggets (instead of just walking his lazy ass two steps and putting extras in my container I brought in. He tells some kid to do it. The kid is like... scared of something. Finally picks up on what I need and adds extra nuggets. I walk out. Well, the nuggets are old as FU*CK and I got a HALF a container of OLD, DRY FU*CKING fries. I'm pretty sure every single one of those lazy morons would have been annoyed if they spent their $12 on some old sh*t when they specifically (kindly) asked if it's okay to wait for a new batch.   Not to be a jerk but every person in there was black and I guess they just didn't give two fu*cks to help a white chick out.   Merry Christmas and I hope that every one of you, for the rest of your lives, always get overcooked, or underdone, dry, old food where ever you go."}
{"text":"Stopped by tonight. Super slow to take order and then got it wrong. No one hurries here."}
{"text":"After getting our order wrong twice.  They wanted to argue with us even while they are able to read it from the screen and see it was wrong.  The wait was long and the food was wrong.  Drive further and find the another Wendy's"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. After multiple bad experiences at this Wendy's I am finally writing a review. Tonight in the drive through we ordered 2 Dave's Doubles no buns. She asked if we wanted cheese and I said yes. She asked if we wanted combos and I said no. I did ask for extra pickles. She then asks \" so you want four pieces of meat with cheese?\" Yes, I answer. \"Ok hold on she says\". She comes back on after a minute and says that's $10.?? A Daves single with 3 add-on meats. I said ok. Then a different person gets on the speaker and says \" sorry we can't make that, a triple is the biggest we make\". Dumbfounded I say \"really, your kidding right\". She says \"no we can't make that\". After laughing hysterically I drove off with no burgers."}
{"text":"They are always quick with the food. The food tastes like Wendy's food should taste like. And, today, after a hard day of moving, I stopped there for just a large drink and the guy was very nice. Very very nice!"}
{"text":"Wow! I haven't been handed a brown salad and 4 day old fries from the dumpster in awhile. Yikes Wendy's get yourself together."}
{"text":"Consistently wrong order, cold food and missing items. Generally give attitude if you need something corrected.... no reason to recommend, unless comparing to the Buckeye location, this would be a step up."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Nice service. Food was as ordered. This was at night, drive thru."}
{"text":"The customer service is ridiculous. It seems as if the younger people that work there have no respect for the customers. I had questions about a menu item & the young man acted like he didn't want to assist me. I wasn't greeted at the drive-thru & there's a young, Asian girl who had the worst attitude known to man. No eye contact & basically tossed me my items. Honestly, because of my last experience I won't be back. I almost forgot, they messed up my order.   If you can help it, just don't give them your time or money. You can even look at the other reviews for this particular location. Save yourself the headache."}
{"text":"Slowest Wendy's ever!! Drive through took almost 25 minutes and there were only three cars in front if me! My suggestion would be to skip this place after dark. I hope their service during the day is better then at night!"}
{"text":"My family just visit this location. Service was pretty fast and employees nice and helpful. The issue was the manager. Her body language and racist remarks shows that immigrants are not welcome in this restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in several years and I noticed a coupon in my mail for a BOGO single cheeseburger.  The place really hasn't changed a lot in 18 years.  The dining room has been remodeled a couple of times.  The cheeseburgers were just as expected, I got a \"natural\" lemonade to wash them down and it tasted just like I used to make lemonade so they scored on that one.  This may have been the first time I ever ate there without getting a Frosty. :-)  The dining room was clean and every time a few tables cleared they had someone out cleaning."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever! Probably the slowest service and the worst un educated staff. Not only the slowest service but all of the orders were wrong. Multiple people came inside from the drive-through. I would eat wood chips with milk before I go back to this Wendy's"}
{"text":"This is the nicest Wendy's I've ever been to in my life! It's brand new and is super clean. They got my order right and FAST. When I say fast, I ordered and received my food in order 3 minutes.  I really like their spicy chicken sandwich as well as their nuggets.  As far as fast food restaurants goes, Wendy's has the best French fries as far as I'm concerned. I've only been to this location once but the parking lot and drive through were especially busy when I was there during lunch.  It's in a difficult spot to get in and out of because of the traffic pattern.    Food was standard for Wendy's but the service was great and I will be returning! Love that we have a new fast food restaurant in the area that has some healthier options.  They have a yummy baked potato that you can get as well instead of fries. On cold days I like to enjoy their chili."}
{"text":"I can't believe the terrible experience I had tonight at this location. I waited in line for 20 minutes just to make my order. No apologies were made about the holdup. The cashier actually walked off at one point while I was waiting in line  and said \"I can't handle this.\"  So while I'm waiting for my food I headed over to the coke freestyle machine to get my drink. It was empty. The only drink options on the machine were Sprite Zero products and regular coke.  Then I went to sit down at a table while I continued to wait for my food. I could not find a clean table in the restaurant. Would have settled for one table that had a clean spot big enough for one person to eat at but that wasn't available.  Waited ten more minutes from ordering for my food. Horrible horrible experience. I like Wendy's but will never return to this location. They really need to do something to fix this place."}
{"text":"Drove thru this location at 11 am this morning.  Order taker was friendly and got my order totally correct.  Ordered the new Pick 2 for $4.99.  Got the Apple Pecan Salad and small Chili.  At the window, the staff was friendly, took my dinero, gave me the right change.   When I got home, I found that all was well...they remembered plastic forks, knives, spoons, crackers, pecans, and dressing.  They even included plenty of napkins!  Food tasted good, chili was temperature hot, and chicken on top of salad was warm, just as I like chicken on top of a cold salad.  Good experience, will go back again soon.  Maybe I will try their new breakfasts next time."}
{"text":"Looks nice from the outside.  Smelled of dirty mop water when I walked in. Trash cans overflowing in the guest eating area. No paper towels in mens restroom. Lady taking my order didn't listen when I was ordering and didn't listen when asking me questions. Burger had a funny smell, almost like a fishy smell.   Won't come back here."}
{"text":"I normally do not do a review for a chained fast food place, the food on the menu is the same as it is in California, Nevada, Arizona, and where ever I might be, but I have to say, this place deservers my review!  My prego daughter was craving their French fries and Frosty, and Wendys is just walking distance from my house, so off we went, now up until about 3 weeks ago this Wendy's was my number 1 Wendys to avoid, the staff was horrible, the placed just looked tore up, but in the middle of Aug I noticed that they shut Wendys down, and I was like WOOO HOOO someone else thought it was crap, and then I saw they were remodeling it, my hopes were small.  Then I heard that they let go of the staff, and that right there was an improvement and then they opened back up about 3 weeks ago, now my daughter has already been back, she was going through withdrawals from the Frosty and she kept telling me mom its nice, and the staff is good.  Well let me tell you, this isn't your normal Wendys anymore, I think Dave Thomas would be proud of this place! It's classy and modern.  Good job Wendys!  Digging the new soda machines, love the many choices for Sprite!  S/n the staff last night was watching me like a hawk when I was taking pictures, guess they are not used to crazy picture taking Yelpers....and even free WifI!"}
{"text":"I eat at this Wendys literally at least 4 times a week.  I have had a couple days of slow service but the food has always been fresh and warm.  As far as fast food goes I do not believe it gets any better than this."}
{"text":"Worst of the worst. I generally am happy with Wendy's but this location is the exception. I have yet to get my order correct. They take forever I have spoken with (they claim) the manager and each and every time I get one excuse after the other. I break down every so often cause they are so close to me. I have tried to reach corporate to complain but they have no phone number to call. They should pull this store from the current owner cause they could care less."}
{"text":"They are getting better here.   The food arrived quickly and they have a new ordering board which is nice.  My burger was better than it has been in the past.  The cobb salad was very good."}
{"text":"Food was very good for Wendy's restaurant was clean . I had to walk in drive through 15 cars.  When I got in all the people working hard but it was very understaffed no wonder the drive to had such a long wait with all the competition opening in the area this is surprising I probably will not be back"}
{"text":"The food here is always good up to Wendys standards. I see all the negative reviews about the drive-through making an error on the order I have never had a problem.   What is so hard about checking your order.  It is an inexpensive fast food meal if you have the right expectations the food is very good and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I've only been in this Wendy's a few times, but I've been through the drive thru more than I want to admit lol! But I'm always treated with a smile and my order has only been off once which they quickly and happily fixed.  To me a place that's nice, quick, and has good customer service is going to have me going back more than naught. So if you're in the mood for some nuggets and a frosty I'd say this Wendy's is a great location to stop at!"}
{"text":"This wendy's is awesome!  I got the 4 for 4.  The cashier was so nice.  She let me trade my drink for a frosty, no charge, and she stacked overfull but not messy.  My food was ready when I was and it was quality food for great value!  Their chicken nuggets are the freshest I have found."}
{"text":"Great FRIENDLY service!!! OMG we would return just because of that! The manager said \"hello & happy Monday\" to everyone standing in line! That put smiles on our faces ! I even heard one of the staff tell a guest when they got there food to let thrm know if there is anything he needs before he leaves!  Those are great examples of genuine customer service & for us, a first impression! Our Food was hot, fresh, fast & satisfying at a terrific value... we are glad we stopped before an appointment today! We will be back!!! Good job Wendy's crew!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Stopped there 2 nights ago and hadn't been there for some time.  It was as good as I remember.  The staff was polite and efficient!  Thanks bunches!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, employees cursing, no sense of urgency. Order was wrong and also rushed. Overall horrible experience"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! I never do fast food for a reason. My motto is if you can drive through keep driving. I arrived home to eat a chicken sandwich, and baked potato. It looked like it was sitting around all day, dry and not edible. The baked potato looked disgusting. Nothing was fresh. I immediately called the store number on my receipt to speak to a manager. She was polite enough to listen to my complaints about their crappy food. She only offered a refund, and no apology. You have seen the last of me at this fast food garbage dump. I will stay on my healthy path, and avoid fast food. Thanks Wend's for convincing me to never eat junk. Where's the beef? How about where's my damn refund, and apology?"}
{"text":"I rarely go to Wendy's, but my hubby wanted it.  So we got take out for lunch.  The place was packed.  The drive thur line was LONG (about 8 cars ahead).  Place the order, paid, and 30 seconds POOF the entire was  ready.    Ordered: MONTEREY RANCH CRISPY CHICKEN SANDWICH (Crispy fillet of all-white meat chicken topped with Monterey Jack, fresh lettuce and zesty ranch sauce.) from the $0.99 menu.  It is not bad!!  Chicken was crispy (I know it is processed) still not bad with the ranch and cheese.  BACONATOR Applewood Smoked Bacon piled high atop a 1/4 lb. patty of fresh with sliced American cheese and mayo.  Ok, the bacon is good and it brings out the beef.  All these things together are HUM-GOOD.    FRIES They are ok."}
{"text":"It's a Wendy's. An over-priced airport one...but still a Wendy's.  Make sure you stay on their tails when you order. They forgot mine and it wasn't busy. The staff are extremely friendly...but they could focus more on the customer than restocking the condiments and wiping down counters.   This location is hidden in Terminal A."}
{"text":"This place does not listen! Order took 30 minutes for two sandwiches and fries!! Fast food nightmare"}
{"text":"Dont waste your time. The girl behind the counter was incredibly rude for no apparent reason, because you work at a  fast food joint and didn't amount to anything don't take it out on me.  First I asked if they had a military discount cause every other wendys does and she said no with an attitude. Second i ordered two meals and she kept getting it wrong. It took her 3 tries. Then when she made the drinks she slammed them on the counter almost spilling them. You would think that her seeing me by myself with two orders she might offer a drink carrier but no, so i ask for one and she just tosses it on the counter. Once i get my food i asked for ketchup she gave me 1 packet so i asked for some more packets she walks away and comes back with 1 more packet. Worst lunch ever"}
{"text":"Went thru the drive up and was handed a glass of tea with the lid no on it correctly so it spilled all over my lap.   Tried to call manager at location hung up trying to speak to one.   Contact there corporate office and 14 days later no nothing from company. Bad service!   Employees don't care and neither does the company.   Will never go to another one!"}
{"text":"This place as good food and awesome service. I forgot my keychain that gives you a free mini frosty (charity promotion) and they gave it to me anyways. Thanks - especially to Danielle."}
{"text":"They were out of baked potatoes at 11p.m. when we arrived in Arizona last night. Settled on a large 3-piece chicken meal. Large iced tea to wash down the hot tenders and fries. Boys all had large burger meals but everyone agreed the food wasnt quite as good as a Wendy's meal from home. Could stand to tone down the salt use on the fries, so that they're a little less like potato sticks covered in cat litter. But at least drive thru was open late."}
{"text":"The food is good and the drive thru service is fast...to a fault.  The food is always good and hot.  If I had to review the food it would have 4 to 5  stars; but the service on a particular day this month was a  little troubling.  I come to this Wendy's often.  I work in the area and they are always moving very fast. and it seems if you are not on the same pace they are a litte annoyed.  My order was $4 and some change.  I gave the cashier a $10 bill and she only gave me change back as if I gave her a $5 bill.  I asked for the rest of my change and she said you only gave me a $5 bill.  I told her she was wrong and she called for the supervisor...actaully she yelled for the supervisor.  I pulled to the front talked with the supervisor, they count her drawer and it was as I said...I gave her a $10 bill.    I don't think the young lady was trying to scam me BUT I know they are moving very fast and they need to slow down b/c incidents sunch as these  The supervisor was blah towards me and not very apologetic at all.  If the supervisor was apologetic I would have felt better.    I would just make sure you say out loud what you are giving the cashier so you both are aware of the money given."}
{"text":"Drove up to the speaker and the girl acted like immediately like she didn't want to talk clearly into the mic. As if she was being a little dismissive when I got to the drive-through. As I pull up to the window, I sense that there was an attitude. she was very sharp and stern like is if she did not want to be at work. Asked for a grilled chicken sandwich with no honey mustard but adding mayo, light salt on french fries. I always asked for light salt on french fries because I like my fries fresh. And that's normally how it's done. As she gave me my bag I opened it to check to make sure everything was correct. Everything but my fries of course.  I check the sandwich and everything seem to be fine but as I'm checking it, it seems like immediately the whole staff came to look into my car to see what was going on like as if I was a celebrity, because as I put my sandwich back into the bag, I see them all staring at me! Lol. Very awkward.    I got home and I started digging in the bag for french fries and guess what, my fries was not cold. I ate the sandwich before I got there but I was so hungry I didn't complain about how stale the bread was. I just wanted a quick meal after the gym. But I got a attitude and  awkward stares for no reason. Stay away from this place. It seems like anybody can get a job."}
{"text":"The staff at this Wendy's was extremely friendly and accommodating to my gluten and dairy free needs.  They made me a special side salad without cheese and I had a plain burger without a bun.  Perfect. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Every time I go at night on drive thru it always smells like weed in there. They blast music and some one the employees look high. My food NEVER fails to be missing something. I love Wendy's but this one is just a total mess at night!"}
{"text":"They asked me \"how are you?\" \"Great!\" I replied \"how are you?\"  They didn't respond and just asked me what I wanted to order. My day is ruined. 1 star"}
{"text":"My 2 co-workers and I ordered the 'Giant JBS $5 Meal' which is a great deal, you get a double burger with bacon, chicken nuggets, frys and a drink. When we got back to the office to eat our food all 3 orders were just a single patty. Now the food tastes great but the advertisement says it comes with \"double the beef\" and there is a picture with 2 patties. So I'm writing this review because this is false advertisement."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Wendy's in some time now , but WOW What a disappointment .  The people all look like they HATE their jobs and treat the customers accordingly. The food was horriable. The number one meal was down sized to the 99 cent cheeseburger and the fries tasted like they were sitting in grease that was a year old. The big coke was 3/4 ice and 1/8 water and 1/8 coke.  I threw my mean in the garbage. I wont be back. If this is what Michael Obama wants us to eat ? Well lets see her and her kids eat it !  WOW Dave , I bet your turning over in your grave , you poor bastered !"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you feel like getting a comedy show from the idiots working the drive thru and the manager.   Welcome to McDonald's....hehe hehe  How can we mcserve you? Hehe   Hey guys - I got a hungry family at home and no time for you bs. I'll be in touch with the GM in the morning."}
{"text":"Wow all I can say is wow food was cold fries where cold the burger was pink I never seen pink in a burger so small only good thing is Brian gets 4 start for customer service"}
{"text":"You may be asking yourself, \"Dude, Why are you so freaking stoked about this shitty airport Wendy's?\"  Well, if you're in Terminal 2, chances are, you're flying United.  United does not offer food on trips less than 2 hours.  The flight to SFO is 1 hour 55 minutes.  That's why."}
{"text":"this location is easy for my work and the potatoes and salads are great for my dietary restrictions but employees don't listen to instructions... ask for butter you get sour cream, ask for extra dressing you get none. silly mistakes but very annoying. It is always crazy loud here too employees sound like they are always in chaos maybe thats why they cant follow instructions"}
{"text":"very disappointed. was outside in the heat all day, just craving a 4 for 4. Finally talked my boss into letting me take a break, risking my job to leave. i ordered. there was fast service, ill give them that. but so fast they forgot my chicken nuggets. when i got back to work i realized that. i screamed in anguish at the top of my lungs. so loud, that when a nice elderly lady heard me hurling insults to the gods, she reported me to corporate. i lost my job the next day. thanks to wendy's i am unemployed with 4 kids and have no hope for my future."}
{"text":"Whenever we ask my husband where he wants to eat,  including restaurants,  he chooses Wendy's!! He loves the salads especially the Apple pecan and the spicy chicken sandwich. My favorite is the baked potato and chili and we both really like the chicken wraps.  We also like our Wendy's because they have the fancy coke machine.   The restrooms and dining areas are very well kept and clean and the employees are friendly."}
{"text":"Let me teach you proper drive thru etiquette after I order 2 combos you don't just give me a total you probably should ask can we make anything else for you not just tell me my total I had to tell the attendant I wasn't finished then completed my order got to the window and the attendant was arguing with someone who reassembled a manager about making more dishes for her witch worries me because do they ever change trays or utensils then I get to the pick up window I'm given some what of greeting passed a bag here you go attendant walks away doesn't say anything I have to check my bags to see what I'm missing sit there he comes back here you go still waiting finally comes back after 2 minutes with my final bag no here you go this time just looks at me like I'm an idiot doesn't ask if I need condiments doesn't say anything along the lines of have a great night no just looks at me I particularly didn't like that there were 2 plain clothes people behind the counter were they managers owners ill never know if they were and they allow service like this while they're there That's pretty pathetic"}
{"text":"Wendys in Parma on Broadview road is the worst. Not poliite, always out of things! They need to focus on hiring competent staff, starting with management! If I could have given 0 I would:("}
{"text":"The service was fine. In fact the cashier was actually pretty friendly. But, if there is one thing that will cause me to never go back is...  When you order something specific and you get all the way home to find out it's wrong. So it goes into the trash... 8 bucks down the drain... And you make yourself a bowl of cereal.  Now, with all the talk about folks working at fast food that think they should be making $15/hr:  this is exactly why you don't.  You had one instruction to hold the mayo and you failed."}
{"text":"I like(d) Wendy's. After Harvey's I thought they served up the best burger for mass consumption in Toronto. A Wendy's double was a serious comfort food for me. Wendy's has recently changed its fries and burger. Ever since Harvey's changed its fries from a whole cut potato to those horrible \"seasoned fries\" and then back to something that was almost like their original fries, I'm really skeptical when a burger chain monkeys with its fry.  I'm happy to say, Wendy's \"sea salt\" fry is actually pretty decent. It's a kind of six or half dozen proposition, ultimately. Either fry was good.  The burger change, I'm less happy about. I Iiked their flat iron patty. I liked it better when there were two stacked together. Three. Well, three was excessive. Even to me. Wendy's, I guess to take on the emergence of mid-market burger chains like Five Guys, has tried to turn out a thicker burger. They have, however, largely failed to improve anything. The packaging is deceptively like an In 'n' Out burger (compare presentation http://www.goodfinancialcents.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/In-N-Out-Double-Double-and-Fries.jpg) but the patty is without flavor. The original flat iron patty had a better flavor and nice mouth feel. I just find when I'm eating the new patty I'm eating something that was engineered in a lab.  Meh.  A 4 star fast food chain is dropped to a 3 star. Wendy's went New Coke. Jerks."}
{"text":"awesome service, the restaurant and bathrooms are so clean!! they had a line out the door that they moved very quickly and food tasted very fresh. not your typical fast food service.  i work nearby and this will definitely be somewhere to go weekly."}
{"text":"Nothing fast about this fast food restaurant! I have been to this location several times and every single time the drive thru service is slow! It doesn't matter if 7 cars are ahead of me or 2, I still end up having to wait a ridiculously long time at a fast food drive thru. There have been 1 or 2 times that I have been in line and have just left because it was taking too long. They do not even have friendly staff to make up for it.  The last experience I had here it was 2 am and there were only 2 cars ahead of us and it was still a 20 min ordeal. And to top it off I was missing a burger from my order.   If you just have a burning desire for Wendy's that will not go away and will wait as long as it takes to get it, than come here. If not, AVOID!"}
{"text":"Second time here, two times to many! How after you give your order in drive thru and it's right on the screen, you STILL don't get what you ordered! 0f course no apology! Save yourself go anywhere else!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would never usually review a fast food restaurant unless I've had a pretty unique, review-worthy experience. And I do have one.  Wendy's was our last resort before driving back to LA. In-n-Out's line was way too long.  But boy our problems did not end there. This was so long ago that I can't remember all our troubles with this establishment, but I do remember one. My friend ordered a Wendy's chicken sandwich and he got it, WITHOUT THE CHICKEN. If you know, a chicken sandwich is just bread, lettuce, and chicken. Yup. He was missing the whole chicken patty.  I've never laughed so hard in my life."}
{"text":"Four stars for fast food? Really? Yes! And let me tell you why. First of all, I rarely eat fast food, but I'm working in a part of town that's more industrial and I am currently without my car. So, that means when it comes to lunch options, my choices are very limited. Because I don't know the area too well yet, I just chose the closest place with food: Wendy's.   I love that their menu has so many different choices - both healthy and \"not so healthy\" depending on your mood. I chose the Power Mediterranean chicken salad on my first visit, and the second visit I had the Apple Pecan chicken salad. Both come with - you guessed it - grilled chicken. The ingredients in both salads exceeded my expectations for fast food salads. I'll admit, I've rarely ever eaten at Wendy's before, so I didn't expect much. However, I'm impressed with what they put in them. The apple pecan salad was my favourite of the two, because it's got lots of blue cheese in it.   And to top it off - Vanilla Frosty!! What?! When did they add vanilla to the menu? I only remember the original from when I was a kid. In any case, it was really good. Hands down best healthy fast food lunches I've ever had. I'll be back to try the other salads, too."}
{"text":"I'm slowly making my way to all the places I haven't had access to since I've been in South Africa. Since my husband has never tried Wendy's, I thought why not? And after 3 years of not having the stuff, you really hope that it's what you remember. This location did not disappoint! Everything was fresh, piping hot, and delicious. For a fast food joint, that's saying a lot. Perhaps it also helped that when I went it was around 10PM, so it wasn't very busy. Nevertheless, it's nice to find a location that takes pride in what they're providing. I'm not rating this from any sort of gourmet foodie standpoint, but if you're expecting a hot, tasty junior bacon cheeseburger deluxe and a yummy frosty to follow, you're gonna get it!"}
{"text":"Speedy service, great food and friendly staff. Wendy's has the best value meal items. This location is a good place to study but there are not a lot of outlets for your laptop. The chili cheese nachos are a nice size so you do not have to buy everything at the full size from the supermarket."}
{"text":"The burger and fries taste average, and the portion sizes are rather small for a $10 meal. The Coke machine was fancy due to the touchscreen and many choices of flavors/mixing.  One more thing - the Wi-Fi only allows connections to ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), so you're out of luck if you want to use SSH, IMAP, Remote Desktop, etc."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst Wendy's I've ever been too. If I could put 0 stars I would have. The establishment was dirty and unkept. The customer service was awful, the workers took there sweet time to get take our order. Just an all around terrible experience. The experience was so bad that I downloaded Yelp just to make a review. Im certain I would have a better experience at the gas station next to it."}
{"text":"This location should hire more enthusiastic people that actually want to work. Coke machine was broke, customer service was pretty bleh. Don't think I will be coming to this location for quite a while."}
{"text":"How could Wendy's go wrong you ask? Well, stop by this location and find out why! First of all, their employees look hella sketchy and are all incredibly rude. Secondly, they're ALWAYS out of chili and on the rare occasion they have it; the cup is only 3/4 of the way full and lastly the fries are always undercooked and very soggy. Just yuck. I'd almost rather eat at McDonald's."}
{"text":"I got to admit, this place is consistent! If you order fries they will always be the garbage fries that dwell at the bottom of the basket (1\" or less) saturated in lard, you know the ones that crunch when you bite into them? If you order a sandwich with any sort of vegetables, upon your first bite they will slide their way right out the side. I recommend suiting up real good because all the other \"stuff\" will come sliding out inevitably landing on your gut. But hey, everything's served at the same temperature....warm....to include the coffee. I've been to this place a few times, today was the last. Take the extra time and go somewhere else, your wallet, digestive system, and dry cleaner will all appreciate it. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"The cashier appeared to be 15 years old. Seemed lost. I got sick from the new BBQ pulled pork sandwich burped it all day. Everyone in there ( guests) acted like they were on drugs. I left freaked out and disgusted. And I'm a huge Wendy's fan too. I won't go to this location in a very long time if I ever go back. Also junior bacon cheese burgers use to be $1.39 they raised the price to $1.99. That's so rude to loyal customers and it can't be called a value meanie anymore either!!!!! I'm so upset! Also there was no paper towels in the restroom we had to use the restaurant napkins, they didn't even bother to ask why we were using the napkins to dry out wet hands. I'm so mad!"}
{"text":"Okay, I don't expect a lot from a fast food chain. Everyone knows that it is what it is. But how do you forget to salt french fries!?! This guy was so distracted talking to to cleaner about the pens game that he forgot. And he also stood at the window facing the other guy, repeatedly stuffing napkins into my bag. Totally weird. What?? At the least the woman who rang up my order was nice. I just had to drive home and salt them myself. Frosty was delicious though and this will probably (and unfortunately) not stop me from coming here in the future."}
{"text":"I have gave this particular Wendy's location multiple opportunities and they have yet to get one order correct. I even wrote corporate and never received a response. If you order grilled chicken it will be breaded. If you order unsweet iced tea it will be sweet. I actually considered ordering the wrong thing to see if I can get what I really want... Getting your preferred condiments is absolutely beyond this group of folks. It is really too bad this location is very near our home but we will not be back.  I will say the location is always clean."}
{"text":"Staff is always rude. Customer service needs a LOT of work. No greetings, no thank yous, no asking for repeat business."}
{"text":"I normally don't write reviews, but I felt compelled in this case. Why do they always give me cold fries here? I don't get it even when I politely ask for a fresh batch my requests are ignored ..why?!?!! Is it to much to ask that in this  life a man gets some hot fries? Never eat here unless you like cold fries"}
{"text":"Would you like some fries with your salt? Salt is the main event at this Wendy's location. My fries were cold, limp and tasted like they dumped an entire shaker or two of salt on them. They actually were not edible. My Single burger was pretty good. Nice and juicy and served hot unlike the fries. I think the chili is pretty good but can't comment on the other fare at Wendy's. For now, I'll stick to Five Guys for a fast burger n fries."}
{"text":"I agree with Glenn about this Wendy's is on top of it with there service but check out the pic of the Chicken Sandwich I ordered with lettuce. WITH LETTUCE. Haha What the hell is this. lol I just had to laugh and take a pic when I opened this up. I usually only go here for fries and frostys."}
{"text":"Fast, pleasant service and not a bad value for the money. Gourmet food it's not, but I got what I paid for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I totally forgot how amazing Wendy's was. It literally felt like sex in my mouth. This place is the best place to go to if you're in a rush and starving. Their value menu is perfect. Something about their frostees keep me coming back. I think it's because it's so thick and creamy. I absolutely love them!   I came here for a quick lunch with my sister and mom. To my surprise we only spent about $9. We sure did get our money's worth though. I don't get why this place only has three stars. Y'all know this place hits the g spot."}
{"text":"Have been to this location on many times this may be one of the oldest Wendy's in the city the floors are dirty the equipment is antiquated the personnel is not trained properly this may be the worst Wendy's in history"}
{"text":"2/12/2018  The commercials on TV convinced me that I needed to try giving Wendy's a try as I had not been there for quite a while.  I looked at the reviews for the location on Nellis and Harris and after reading so many poor reviews, I decided to go to Burger King instead.  I have never been to this location but it appears the Corporate Office needs to go in and shake this location up.  This is the first time I've ever given a poor review to a place I've never visited."}
{"text":"Went into this store and bought $34 worth of food. Brought my food home and opened up my burger and there was CHEWED GUM on my wrapper. CHEWED GUM!! Absolutely disgusting. I made my kids and girlfriend throw the food out. Took the burger to the store to show them and they wanted to only refund part of my meal. If that's the way they value customers I'll take my business elsewhere. Photo is attached for viewership."}
{"text":"Wendy's, like any fast food joint is always a hit or miss deal.  This Wendy's was a big miss today.  Under cooked burger,  cold fries, and a flat tasting soda to top off a horrible meal.  This location just underwent a large remodel, it's a shame the food isn't as nice as the building.  I can't recommend this location, but if you like to gamble, take a chance."}
{"text":"I knew it was a bad idea to insult my taste buds with Wendy's salt lick menu but my little girl needed to make a restroom stop so   We started our dissatisfied adventure.   Restrooms were just as clean as the tables, not so nice! The counter guy was pleasant considering he was overwhelmed with his tasks. Trying to catch up from forgetting portions of people's orders while trying to take hours. He did have a good attitude tho!   Received our food and I had a nice long black curly hair sticking out of the box before I even opened it to find it nicely tucked into my hamburger. As I approached the counter, the manager was actually on the way out of the back so I was able to bring it to her attention. She quickly apologized and brought me out a new cheeseburger immediately. She thanked me for not yelling at her, which is very much appreciated considering both of us know how people can be with situations like this. Overall, Wendy's in general but this location not ring exempt has always been a bit of a let down to me. I do have to give a shot out to the manager though for her exceptional customer service!"}
{"text":"Come on it is a chain, but a really nice shop, all brand new, clean and nice. You know you eat fast food every once and a while, if you are on this side of town stop in for some cheep fast food.."}
{"text":"Bad service not even friendly at all. Two bottom buns on my room temperature burger. I eat Wendy's all the time everywhere I go. This is the first time I've had cold food ever. Sorry Wendy's hopefully corporate takes notice and gets this place some help. I've complained once at home for a wrong order but the food was at least fresh."}
{"text":"my favorite location!! super fast drive thru especially during the lunch rush, i'm in and out just in time for my lunch break! and great customer service from when your order to when you drive away"}
{"text":"Ok, normally I would not review a fast food restaurant. Because lets face it most of us have the same experience every time we go to a fast food place. I feel obligated here though because it was one of the worst experiences I have had at any establishment.   I pull into the parking lot and the line was quite long, so I decide to park and order inside and get it to go. I give the homeless guy outside a dollar and make my way inside, this is normal on this side of town. When I enter I see there is a long line inside as well. Note to anyone, do not let hungry control you it was my mistake on this day.   There was ONE person working the front of Wendys, not only was she taking peoples orders. She was also bagging the food, frying the fries and she was most likely making the burgers as well. I stood inline for probably 15 minutes, to get Wendys. When I should have left and just went to Cook Out down the street or even Pinky's. At least at Pinky's you have food in front of you in under 15 minutes.   I took my burger home, I was polite to the girl working because I truly felt bad for her. I get home and open my food. I wish I was surprised but it was ice cold. The bun was firm like it was quite old. The cheese was hardly melted. So not only did I wait 15 minutes but I also got horrible fast food. Oxymoron I know but COME ON!"}
{"text":"Pathetic.  I only go here because it is so close to where I work. I walk in, I'm the only one in line. I place my order, still the only one in line. The cashier ask for my name. WHY? Did a bus pull into the parking lot and I didn't see it? NO! I state my first name and even spell it out. Still, I am the only one in line. I repeated myself at the cashier's request. Again spelling out my name. Upon receiving my to-go bag I look at my receipt and discovered. My first name was spelled wrong. Really? Bad enough to act like you don't want to be there.  The lettuce on my hamburger looked like it was squared off with a pair of scissors. The french fries I was given were almost cold. The soda machine doesn't dispense at least 2/3 of the choices displayed.    Pathetic, and in case you work at this Wendy's, that word is spelled,  P-A-T-H-E-T-I-C."}
{"text":"On Veterans Day we were dinning at Denny's next door. They came in yelling that if anyone had parked in their parking lot they had tow trucks coming.  Apparently whoever was managing that day was making sure that people were getting towed if they felt the vets were not at Wendy's but Denny's. Not that I don't agree that if it happens on a regular basis it should be addressed.  I mean it's one day a year.  All the times I've gone through there NO ONE was searching for parking in order to go eat at Wendy's. No better way to not get people to frequent your establishment then throwing a fit! GREAT JOB MANAGER! I actually use to work for Wendy's when I was a kid but I find this behavior disgusting. Also to be noted I had ordered from this location previously had they'd gotten it wrong a few times. The unpatriotic behavior just sealed the deal and I will no longer be going to any Wendy's establishment. I'm sure the gaggle of vets that were there will no longer be purchasing anything from their either."}
{"text":"So they remodeled and it looks super cool, wide open, bright. Wifi and high top tables you can pull up to, plug in, and look out to the busy street... But I honestly think everyone working this shift MUST be high..  Slow doesn't even begin to describe the Neutral gear this restaurant was moving in... Very strange... Perhaps the full moon?"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude ... I never give bad review but (Jorge)the man in the drive thru was so rude he cut me us off when we were trying to order. Snapped at every thing I said example I asked for a loaded back potato his response \"we have 3 maybe you want to tell me witch one?\" So I didn't know but still he continued to huff and puff.... worst fast food survive I have ever had and I have eaten a lot of fast food in my life"}
{"text":"Horrible!  No baked potato.  Fries were too salty to eat.  My sandwich was requested without tomatoes and luckily I checked before I ate it since they screwed up."}
{"text":"If could leave zero stars I would. I should have known by the empty parking lot during peak hours! The tables were dirty and sticky, fries were cold, the burger was just slapped together and the customer service SUCKED! I usually don't say this about places but this one really warrants it! I saw two people come in from the drive thru line while I was inside. That shows you how bad this place was. Avoid this place at all costs. Worst fast food I have ever had! And I have been to a lot in my lifetime!"}
{"text":"Beware......I ate a simple burger here yesterday from budget  menu and as day went on....got sicker and sicker. I made it home and thought I was about die. I called the paramedics and they said you have food poisoning. Were is last place you ate ? So now in short I have to pay the city....I m missing a day of work....all because of a 1.29 cent hamburger. If you get poisoning over a simple burger .....what happens with a meal ?"}
{"text":"Keep doors locked. Check your order. Thank God you survived."}
{"text":"Errrrrr, definitely NOT the best Wendy's in Crown town. Adequate......"}
{"text":"Called ahead to see what time they closed, they said 2 am. We went at midnight, to have all the employees freak out that we went inside, saying they're closed inside only drive-thru is open. Maybe y'all should lock the doors then if it's closed inside? Sat in the drive-thru for 45 minutes for two small frosty's. Ridiculous.. we saw like 6 cars ditch the line from waiting so long and I don't blame them. Don't waste your time coming here."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and efficient. I ordered the fried Homestyle Asiago Chicken Club sandwich, and a small soda to eat in.  For being fried, the sandwich appeared quickly, which leads me to believe that the fried breast fillet was already made. And in addition, the coating wasn't very crunchy. However, the chicken was nice and hot. And, the bacon and lettuce was nice and crisp. With the tomato being fresh.But, the cheese slice had been sitting out for a while, as it didn't melt very well.   But overall, the sandwich was very good.   The restaurant was nice and clean in the dining area."}
{"text":"So gross. Not only did I find a huge hair in my burger- (gross)but when asked for a refund she wouldn't even refund me for the whole meal because my son had ate some fries!!  Also asked with attitude for me to \"show her the hair\" like seriously??! Ugh this place needs to go out of business. But my own fault for attempting to eat here when they clearly have 2 stars for a reason"}
{"text":"You know when it's real... crappy. This Wendy's is consistently slow and has subpar food quality compared to others. There are several other fast food restaurants in the area that are more worth your money."}
{"text":"This Wendy's at the Charlotte airport is slamming!  I was there for a bite in between flights - Wendy's is seriously one of my favorite fast food outlets.  Like all chains, you have good locations and bad locations.  This location is seriously great!  The service was quick and personable - even in their rushing to serve the line of customers they had, both of the people I spoke with were genial and service oriented.  As most airport locations of chain restaurants, their menu is not the full offering.  The food was fantastic!  I ordered a single with cheese meal, replacing the fries with chili, which the staff accommodated without question as per the Wendy's routine.  I say if you find yourself in the Charlotte airport, needing some food - try the Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Was just there. Got my order totally wrong. We were the only people there... and they get our order wrong.. wtf?"}
{"text":"I was a little hestiant going to this place based on the last review. It went very well. They were fast and food was hot and delicious. Workers were not the happiest and they most likely dont enjoy working there. Overall not bad but I wouldnt seek the place out again based on the workers."}
{"text":"again I went to this Wendy's... today for lunch. Why do I do this to myself? I wanted a burger & Sprite, my pregnant co-worker wanted a baked potato. NO potatoes, WHAAT?!? then NO Sprite!!! They were missing 2 out of 3 items and there was no way in heck I was returning to work without that potato! deny a pregnant girl her craving..  NEVER! so again I spent my lunch break driving to another Wendy's!"}
{"text":"The menu is great! Lots of healthy alternatives to choose from! The pecan apple salad is my all time favorite, but I love the grilled chicken sandwiches too. The customer service is superb. A young man named Christian R. helped me with my order and everything was fresh and scrumptious. Great customer service skills! Thanks Christian! The only thing I'd recommend is better signage because, although it's in a great location, it's hard to see behind Taco Bell and Walgreens."}
{"text":"This Wendy's sits on Eastern Avenue and Warm Springs. This particular Wendy's location is a bit more \"upscale\" than the typical Wendy's restaurant. This one offers better customer service, TV's, lounge chairs, seating more spread out, and one of the new Coca Cola machines which allows for all sorts of drinks options. They keep the dining area clean as well. I like this particular Wendy's the best."}
{"text":"Great hot food! We had a jr bacon cheeseburger, fries, chicken nuggets, and a chocolate frosty."}
{"text":"Went through the drive through and they didn't wait to hear the end of my order, and they forgot my straw. So we went inside and the cashier was very unfriendly. Asked for cheese and they forgot the cheese. I've worked in fast food and I know when service is bad, but boy was this BAD! Too many mistakes to excuse."}
{"text":"I work pretty close by this wendys and every time I go there they always get my order wrong and the food is never fresh. It's disappointing ."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Register folks don't smile and demonstrate no caring about service.  Waiting time to get order, slow.  Accuracy of order more than likely not accurate (I've ordered 3 times on separate occasions, each time wrong).  Options for food, unfortunately, limited elsewhere in the area so they have a captive audience.  Sad.  Airport authority should boot and replace with a better alternative."}
{"text":"I remember going to my first Wendy's, what, a couple of decades ago?  I remember thinking the hamburger tasted just like my mom's.  Flash forward to last week, and granted I haven't been to a Wendy's in a very long time... but my order of fast food, was very disappointing.  The fries weren't \"like they use to be\", my sandwich tasted like McDonalds.  This Wendy's, anyway, is a true disappointment , to me, the food is not worth it, the experience is not worth it, the taste and appearance, \"not like it use to be\"  won't be back... probably impacts my opinion of the entire franchise now..."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! There are way better places seconds from this. On two different occasions I've been here and both times were a complete mess.   The previous time they asked me to pull around and wait for my food and it literally took 40 minutes. Not to mention the food was terrible.   Tonight I went and was hoping the previous  time was a fluke. Well tonight was even worse than the first time. They asked me to pull around after giving us our drinks because they were waiting for \"fresh fries\". It was then that I noticed they gave us the wrong sized drinks so I went in to exchange for the drink I actually ordered. Then the food came. After getting back to the car, we found out they didn't include the frosty we ordered. After getting home, they forgot to include the milk we ordered for my daughters kids meal and our burgers were soaking in God knows what. So all in all we paid $25 to throw our food away. Thanks Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Went here today(drive though) and they tried to hand me the meal of the car Behind me.  And then looked around lost and took an additional 5 min to get me my meal (2 go wraps) they told me twice. Oh they're making it.  Horrible work ethics"}
{"text":"There is a real struggle happening with the staff at this location.  For dine in,expect to wait at least 5 minutes to order your food.  Then expect to wait at least 10 to 15 minutes for your food to be prepared.  No complaints about the food once it arrives, but it's quite an achievement once you get that \"fast\" food on your very own tray after a 20 min wait.  Everything and everyone here is slow, confused and disorganized.  It's uncomfortable just to watch such apathy (if you can stand to look).  Hopefully they can turn things around!  Decades ago, this location was actually better than the McDs on Mayfield in every way.  Since then it has gone from bad to worse, while McDs is always improving everday.    Now, after this Wendy's had their complete rebuild of the building last year, things are completely dismal here.  I realize that it takes committed management talent and teamwork/training/hiring skills to make the turn around happen here, but there is a LONG way to go for this location to approach even acceptable performance.  In the meantime for your Wendy's fix: PLEASE drive down Ridgebury Rd to the Richmond Rd Wendy's.  You will spend far less time driving there than you would waiting for ANYYTHING else here!  True words.  If you can't drive, just walk.  It will still save you time."}
{"text":"This is THE SLOWEST Wendy's I have ever seen. The workers seem clueless and food quality has seriously deteriorated."}
{"text":"I've been twice since I moved nearby, both were a train wreck. This location does not pay attention to customer's orders, messes up customer's orders, and has very average customer service. The last visit the cashier, Kevin, needed to be pulled off the line asap after wrecking at least 6 orders in a row, not getting all the details, confusing the production line... everyone was being patient and cooperative with him, but nothing seemed to help."}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes for a simple order. There was zero communication between the people who worked there, and even after we got the order, they gave us regular nuggets instead of spicy, a chocolate Frosty instead of vanilla. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Terrible lol. Lady that Works in the night shift was terrible, doesn't know how to take orders,, just straight our mean! Lol"}
{"text":"If you cannot have food ready to order you should just close!! Pulled up to the drive thru and sorry please wait. Really!! There were NO customers inside and I was the only one at the drive thru. Tryed to order two large chili and sorry we are out of chili. Hello it's winter. Chili should be in stock for every possible customer. Guessing you should close or get new management."}
{"text":"You could have thought I was a child with a brand new toy last night when Darren, Mom and I stopped here for a quick bite. This is one of those revamped locations. Large flat screen TV, electric fireplace, and lounging chairs! But my greatest excitement came from the soda fountain. It is a touch screen operated dispenser. Push the button for what you want (I got diet coke), and you are given the choice of your soda alone or with one of six flavor additives. Lime, grape, orange, cherry, lemon, and raspberry! I wanted to play with each flavor, but didn't. The food quality itself honestly isn't bad for fast food. Wendy's really has improved! The burger wasn't as greasy as usual and the fries are crunchy and full of flavor! I love the sea salt! They also has a small bakery selection. Darren and I shared an Oreo brownie. Yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuumy!"}
{"text":"Great location only cause it part Of a Tim Horton's. Traffic to get in is horrendous.   Ok with that said staff is super friendly and pricing is good. Food is fresh and portions are good.   Family friendly and drive thru too."}
{"text":"Il y a déjà près de 20 ans que je n'avait pas mis les pieds dans un wendy's.  Je me souvenais que la boulette de buf était carré et que le chili était bon pour une chaîne de burger. Au lieu du traditionnel burger j'ai choisi le sandwich au poulet panné non épicé. Avec frites et chili. Le poulet était chaud et croustillant. Très bien. Les frites aussi était chaude et en bonne quantité. Le Chili était aussi bon qu'il y a 20 ans. Beaucoup de buf et de fèves et bien épicé.  Décor: le restaurant a ouvert il y a un an. Très bien décoré, propre et éclairé. Le menu est clair et limité ce qui fait que ça prend moins de temps à se décider.   Ambiance :Ce qui m'a frappé le plus est l'attitude positive du personnel. Pas seulement entre eux ou ils avaient une bonne camaraderie mais aussi avec les clients. Ça donne le goût d'y revenir.   Le wifi est gratuit et c'est pas compliqué de se brancher Le stationnement est facile."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Sandwich and fries were hot and tasted great. Bathrooms and dining room were clean."}
{"text":"Delicious ghost fries and jalapeño spicy chicken  sand,   mobil app stil not really working here, I dunno why."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit for lunch (their apple pecan chicken salad is a fave). What always impresses me is how friendly everyone who works here is. Usually drive through service is super meh, but I have to give this Wendy's a shout-out!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 4 for $4 and it was great food for cheap prices! The cashier was super nice and patient! I took stuff off my ordered and we switched out drink for an ice cream and they were very friendly through the whole process!"}
{"text":"I just left this location and went I got to my house and got settled to eat I opened my burger wrapping and there was a LONG black hair just stuck to the top of my bun . I personally called and asked why there was a hair just stuck to the top of my bun . I'm so sick to my stomach right now it doesn't make any sense . This is really disgusting, Not to mention the drive through manager was being loud and rude to the employees and it is her hair that was on my sandwich. The other two employees were males with short cuts . Not very good for business and they haven't even been open that long this is a fairly new location . I added a photo of the burger I received. I am not happy with the fact I went out of my way for food when I was on my way home from work ."}
{"text":"I've stopped here twice on the way home from work, and both times they have gotten my Order wrong. I ordered a number 1 cheese burger, I drive home look inside and they give me a chicken sandwich, like how do you mess up that bad??? The second time I came here I ordered chicken nuggets with fries, they give me a cheeseburger???? Seriously?? Then when I turn around and come back so they can correct it, I stand there for 20 minutes listening to them arguing saying, that's not what he ordered!!! Why would I drive back and return the order that I was giving???? On top of that, they weren't polite, they didn't apologize, they gave me my correct order and walked away!! Yet you guys want $15 an hour?? This place is a joke, the employees and the manager!!"}
{"text":"They took way too long and forgot half my order. Wendy's is my favorite store ever and they really let me down. Please don't let them disgrace this heavenly restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever. Avoid at all costs. Staff had no idea what they're doing. Get ready for a long wait, cold food and order all wrong. Don't know how they stay in business"}
{"text":"Great drive through service!  Fast, friendly, my order is always right & I never have to sit there and say \"hello?,,,, hello?,,, is this thing working?\", lol  :) Extra kudos for good customer service.   My go to meal: Spicy chicken without mayo, side Caesar salad & fresh lemonade. Hits the spot!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is okay--nothing special, but not the worst. Its biggest flaw is inconsistency!   PROS:  It's been ages since they've screwed up an order; Tends to be clean.  CONS: When its busy, the employees seem to be a bit disorganized if you're witnessing it from the dining room or the line where you order; Staff seems to lack some professionalism at times (its obvious when a manager isn't around); They missed the memo on the amount/type of Bacon that's supposed to be on the Baconator.  Every other Wendy's puts a ton of crispy and delicious bacon on there; This is the only location where the bacon is still crappy, fatty and soggy @ times. The restroom could use an update--its seen better days."}
{"text":"Quick drive thru if you are on a lunch break, nice staff.  Went at an off time for a small fry and small frosty since I was hungry and needed a snack (~2 p.m.).  Fries were hot and tasted fresh and the frosty was delicious as always.  Parking lot is poorly designed, so it can back up into the main road, which blocks traffic flow and irritates other drivers.  It can also block you into a parking spot in their already rather small private parking lot and you will need to wait for a kind driver to not move forward in the line for you to be able to back out.  I would recommend parking in the lot close by and walking over to avoid this dilemma!"}

{"text":"As it is an airport vendor, expect the lines to be quick or not. I was lucky in that service was quick for me. So, unless you're near the cashier as they call out the order numbers, you might just end up missing out on whether or not they have called out your number if there happens to be no line.  The place is situated between an Asian fusion takeout on the right, and a Mexican place on the left. All 3 joints share a fountain drink area near the Asian place. So, if you happen to have quick sandwich makers, your order just might be called as you're still deciding which drink to have.  The server in my particular case calls out the numbers only once, and doesn't enunciate very clearly. I heard only the \"teen\" part of the number. Other than having to ask empty air which number was called, I was happy with the quick service.  The food on the other hand, ... I haven't eaten at a Wendy's in years, so I am not familiar with some of their sandwiches. I had a spicy asiago chicken sandwich. It was just right for me in terms of the spicy (bland), but there was little asiago. I don't know why I chose chicken, since I only eat dark meat. It was just okay. Not good enough for me to eat all of it.  The fries were good. I didn't see immediately where to get ketchup and I didn't want to go back to ask for them.  I did have stomach problems a few hours later, and the food was the only thing I had all day. Not necessarily a connection, but it makes me wary of trying this place again."}

On the receipt it said \"2 bbq\" but we wanted sweet and sour, we were still waiting for the food at the window and when the big Italian looking guy came he literally just handed us the bad and without saying a word was headed for shutting the window. Before he could shut it I quickly asked him \"what sauces are in the bag\" he said \"bbq\" I asked \"could we get sweet and sour instead, I'll trade you the bbq\" (I know they won't take the sauce back after already giving it out but I didn't want to seem needy) he said \"no it's ok\" and handed me the sweet and sour...when we got home there wasn't any other sauces in the bag other than the sweet and sour we asked for...so originally there wasn't sauce in the bag at all until we asked for it This guy was like a slob a half fast slob he didn't care at all this place is just a job to him...in our strawberry lemonade we asked for easy ice...it was as if he were being a smart ass because he added EXTRA ice... His name is Jorge (that's what the receipt says) it wasn't the food...it was the service...zero stars for him and who he represents..."}
{"text":"This was the friendliest and most thorough service that I have ever received at an airport chain. The food was hot, my order was accurate, they accepted Wendy's mobile coupons, the manager greeted me, and the cashier seemed enthusiastic about being helpful. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"I came here wednesday after work i walked in, and there were a few people waiting for food. It wasnt super busy at all so i was in line. The manager took someones order and continued to get food ready. I stepped up to the counter, and waiting for the manager or someone to take my order. They all looked at me i stood there for 10 minutes, and walked out since clearly the older manager that worked wednesday evening at like 830 had a problem so i didnt go there. I wont be coming back for awhile until that manager shows me some respect"}
{"text":"manager served me screwed up multiple times. asked for burger w lettuce tomato ketchup pickle mustard screen said it didn't get it. not hard to read. then asked to get fresh fries served me cold ones. served me a frosty dripping ice cream all over it was going to give it to me to get it all over my clean car. asked for ketchup and salt for fries. scanned gift cards told me no money on it didn't even give me print out of it. so I come back to later find no spoon do I eat a frosty w my fingers next after I leave I am about to eat burger not done rt. real bad as people have allergies they don't care could kill someone. return it to tell them error again. at this point tired of it. take your meal. this is an indian manager uses the excuse he was alone but saw owner come to window as well as another girl. nice you lie to customers too. done with going there."}
{"text":"This was such a confusing and sad experience. Everyone of the workers had this look of boredom on their faces. The girl at the register should have just been sent home until she felt better. She looked like she didn't really want to be there. The manager looked like she had just got up and came to work 5 min ago. The drive-thru was backed up so I guess that made the inside store slow because it took almost 20min for my food and then on top of that my fries were half done and my nuggets were cold and seemed like they were just re-fried.  That was a waste of good money and my time.  I won't be going back to this location. I've read the other reviews and apparently management doesn't care because nothing has been done about the negative customer service here."}
{"text":"I'll tell you what. I am sick to death of kids as managers on duty at fast food restaurants. They have never learned simple courtesy or customer service. I called after receiving the wrong order. Instead of a single burger I got a single cheeseburger. I asked the price difference, and the kid said they are both $4.09. What the heck????? How is a crappy burger twice the cost of Burger King or McDonalds? When I asked the 12 year old snotty kid, his response was he didn't make the prices. Did he ever say he was so sorry I got the wrong order? Did he think it was an issue he should address with the girl at the drive-thru? Did he have any interest my concerns? Nope to all. Crappy food, crappy management, crappy attitudes."}
{"text":"What a fail. 12 noon, one register open, and that girl is either a trainee or lazy. SO SLOOOOOOWWWWW. The girl keyed in my order correctly, simple, a hamburger with catsup only, no cheese. It came with cheese and no catsup. Back up to the counter, the manager on duty takes the wrong burger and makes a new one herself. Stale bun. She knew it and made it anyway. My mom ordered the chili. It was so spicy she tried adding some sugar but it still burned her tongue. I quit going to the Darrow Road Wendy's in Stow, and it looks like this one is no better. Dave must be turning over in his grave."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been back to this Wendy's since last January. The food I got through the drive-thru was so bad I got back in my car and took it back for a refund. I asked the 12 year old manager to open the sandwich and look at the bacon. As you can see in my picture, it was totally burnt and inedible, and the burger was just about as bad. The arrogant kid looked at it and said \"looks like our bacon\". He amended his comment by saying maybe it was a little crisper than usual, but he'd be happy to refund my money. When he returned to the window, I told him he wasn't getting my point. I told him it was only the second time I've been there in a year, and both times it was inedible. He just got a smug smile on his face and didn't respond, so I told him not to bother apologizing since it would be too much for him. I honestly don't know how this restaurant stays open. I very rarely see cars at the drive-thru or parked to eat inside."}
{"text":"I'm totally bewildered. I ordered a single burger with catsup only and a small Coke with extra ice. Seemed pretty simple to me. The screen showed a cheeseburger, so I asked the girl to fix it, she said she'd take care of it. I got to the window and the young man said $5.89. I told him he couldn't have the order right. He said a Dave's Cheeseburger and a Coke with no ice. I said no, a single burger with catsup only a small Coke with extra ice. He said well the Coke is $1.69. You wanted that with no ice right? Oh, no, just a separate cup of ice. I put my head in my hands for a moment, then repeated for the fourth time what I ordered. He again repeated back two different things. I said just give me my money back, you people are too confused. I had to snatch my $5 bill out of his hand, and he hollered as I drove away, sarcastically, I apologize ma'am! Goodness gracious, how can two employees be so unable to complete a simple order?"}
{"text":"The place is nice and the service is fast. Only reason I'm giving two stars is because one day I was in the drive thu and I was deciding what to get. I guess the person working the window forgot to mute their headset and I could hear everything they were saying. They kept saying hurry up and to make a choice already. Then, I guess they realized it was on and started apologizing. I told them don't worry about it, but I think it was very rude."}
{"text":"This Wendy's has your typical menu, including burgers, nuggets, baked potatoes, and chili. In the restaurant itself seemed more modern and updated than most locations that I have been to. The bathrooms were clean, and had a child changing station as well. The service was quick, and the staff was friendly."}

{"text":"I honestly can't believe they would serve this potato. There really isn't much but a potato skin. I'm not sure how to describe it other than small, dried out and lacking any type of nutritional content. Wow. You guys can do better than this, right?"}
{"text":"I guess I should have read these Yelp reviews before choosing this Wendy's over the one down the road on Deer Vally. Employee that took our order at the drive through was lacking in customer service training (major turn off). Then when we get to window we are handed our drinks but no straws, and before we can ask for them she is gone and the window is shut. Quite a few minutes later a different man delivers our food in a bag. He is very nice (hence the 1 star) and bids us goodbye. We get our food home and find 1/2 full French fries that are lukewarm almost cold, and both our chicken sandwiches are missing a key ingredient - tomatoes! My husband paid extra for bacon and cheese, so we peeked under the chicken patty to find one small piece of bacon and what looked like 1/2 slice of cheese. Overall this meal was unsatisfying and I felt somewhat robbed of the $18 I spent."}
{"text":"As far as fast food goes I enjoy Wendy's far more than macdonalds or others like that. I often get the grilled chicken burger with a side caesar instead of fries. If the chicken is not bone dry and I can add to or three ketchup's than I enjoy the burger. I find that often it's dry so I have to add more ketchup. I like the mandarin chicken salad as well. The dressing is really flavorful. This is a healthier choice than macdonalds."}
{"text":"We knew this wasn't a great location but it was closest so we went there. I gave my order twice. I asked for no cheese on my single.  I got extra cheese and the fries were awful.  When we got to the second window, the girl didn't even speak to us. Just handed us the food and walked away. No smile. No thank you.  I agree with the others. It's still there because they're right outside Carowinds."}
{"text":"I have never been to Wendy's before so this was my first visit. I arrived here during lunch to grab it to go however it was my first time so I decided to come in because I don't trust drive-through.   There were few people ahead of me so I had a chance to glance at the menu to figure out what I wanted for lunch. I ordered the berry salad and the famous French fries. I handed my credit card and I waited for my receipt but come to find out, they give you the receipt after your order is ready. So I waited for my order and meanwhile one black lady was complaining about her chicken nuggets were cold so she wanted to exchanges it for burger. He started helping her while I am still waiting for my order or receipt for that matter. They replaced her half order nuggets with full burger and fries. Wow.. What a bargain. Anyhow.. After fifteen to twenty minutes my order was ready and I was handed the bag with my receipt.  Once I was in my office, I tried the salad and its OK. Based on the price, the quantity was quite low. Considering this is a fast food, they price is bit high. I would rather go to a dine-in place like Extreme Pita which is little better place and where most stuff are fresh with same price."}
{"text":"Wow! fancy Wendy's! Wear your food t-shirts! Super nice updated seating area.  Food good! I like Wendy's! Apple pecan salad super tasty! Fries-yum!   Friendly staff... 5 stars for Wendy's!"}
{"text":"I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I agree with most other reviewers... They are pretty darn fast for lunch rush in drive thru, never had a mistake on my order and the people are nice in drive thru. Good for them at serving people the right way."}
{"text":"We went through the drive-thru, they forgot to give us spoons or straws and gave us 1 napkin and 1 ketchup packet for 2 meals.  You would think that condiments and plastic ware came right out of the employees paychecks the way that they were trying to conserve them!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Just plain horrible. Like the other review, get one star cause I have to. Ordered a small chili with cheese. Asked for some chili sauce packets on the side. A spicy chicken sandwich combo with a side of ranch. The wifey was nice enough to get it in the first place, so I can't complain to her. No ranch. No chili sauce. No spoon to eat the chili. No straw for the drink. No napkins to wipe hands with. Did get ketchup for the fries, but didn't eat them because they were colder than the ice in my drink. I was soooooo angry I actually called. The manager offered to give me the stuff if I drove down and pick up the items. There was no mention of a refund or a gift card for a future order. Doesn't matter because I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered two bacon cheeseburger but got one bacon cheeseburger and one cheeseburger instead. I had made sure everything was in the bag before leaving but much to my surprise one of them was incorrect. Please double check to see if the order is right, it's so annoying on the customer's end trying to figure out if we want to go make a trip back and have you guys change it or just suck it up. Either way it's really bothersome which would have been understandable if it was a complicated order but it was possibly the simplest thing anyone could order"}
{"text":"So I have been back to this location a couple of more times because it is convenient when you find yourself hungry right before going shopping at the Fry's I have noticed a few different faces at this location and this most recent time that I was there, the food surprisingly was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Wendy's! Everyone here is nice and seems happy to be there, the food always seems \"fresh\" and the service is very fast!"}
{"text":"Dear Wendy's, Today I was very disappointed with the drive-thru service.  I was excited to see the taco salad back on the menu. I ordered the salad along with a junior fry and small green tea. At the window I paid for my meal and was handed my drink (without a straw). The service seemed slower than usual and it took a few minutes before I was handed my bag of food. I glanced inside to see if there was a straw but since there wasn't, I asked for one and then drove off.  I've gave a rating of 2 stars because the French fries were piping hot, fresh and delicious.   However, I did not receive tortilla chips with my taco salad. I did not receive a fork or other utensils. I also did not get a receipt with my meal. I tried to call the store twice this afternoon to speak with a manager and the line has been busy. This was not your best service and I hope it can be improved for the future.   Sincerely, A disappointed customer"}
{"text":"She was short and very rude thru the drive thru. Want even busy. I wanted to throw my frosty at her face."}
{"text":"Not bad for a fast food restaurant. This location tends to be clean, friendly, and make our orders correctly. Their salads are way better than most fast food joints, too."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru on a Sunday evening.  Ordered a combo, 2 burgers, nuggets, and an iced tea.  They were out of tea, gave me one straw instead of two, forgot my nuggets (but charged me), and no receipt.  Check your bag before you drive off."}
{"text":"Decent food. Came out hot and quick. Their sea salt fries are bomb and I like how they always have a new special item every month"}
{"text":"Will not be back. With one customer, they still took forever to take our order. Even tho we have used senior discount here before, he said they didn't have one. Sandwich was same mediocre as always."}
{"text":"So I wasn't going to write a review but I feel like you need to know. There's a gentleman who works the drive-through seems like a younger guy with dark hair. He never smiles he's completely unprofessional never says thank you and literally looks to me like he wants to kill me. Every time I come there lately the food and service have been horrible. I tried to give someone a call today after my salad was completely wilted and the lettuce felt like somebody poured water all over, no one answered. I would've liked to have spoken to someone individually but considering I've tried to call numerous times....I'm also in the food and hospitality business. I'm letting you know now if this keeps going the way its going you're going to lose a lot of business! $10 down the drain, and I'm on my \"lunch break \" and don't have time to go somewhere else. I guess I'll just drive 10 minutes out of the way for something else next time. #stillhungry"}
{"text":"I ordered a Dave's Double. I bit into it and the patty was crunchy. There was little specks of ground bone in the patty. Absolutely the worst. I brought it to the counter and they replaced it. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Waited for about 20 minutes in the drive thru to get home and realize not only have they screwed up practically my whole order but the one thing they got right... A chicken sandwich... Had a freakin BONE in it! Damn near broke my F'n tooth! F this place! Wish i could give it 0 stars!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers made on the spot and don't have to wait long.  The chili is great as always."}
{"text":"First time here I will be back got my order right and the employees were friendly I would recommend coming here"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and will be the last time my hamburger was pink in the middle and got me sick I would not recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Might be one of the worst for service.  I've been here 2 times this week with long lines because order taker has to fill orders too.  The place is dirty and poorly managed.  One star because I had to pick a star"}
{"text":"24 May 2015: My cousin, her husband, and I needed a late night something-to-eat. Since I was the guest, I got to choose, and decided on Wendy's 'cause I wanted chili cheese fries.   The food was everything I could have hoped for, especially since I drank HEAVILY the night before.   The drive-thru didn't take long, at all. Once we rolled up to the window, we were handed our food without incident.  ..It only took long because the guy in front of us was hauling an empty trailer."}
{"text":"In at 12:57 but closed already... The people inside said the boss said to close. WE WENT TO JACK"}
{"text":"This must be the slowest Wendy's on the planet. Seriously, the slowest! 9 people in front of me and it too 33 minutes to get to the register. I think it's dinner time now."}
{"text":"BrEAKFAST!!! On the go. I know, its a cookie cutter fast food joint, but I bet if they had cookies they would be delicious. Because their breakfast options certainly are.  First off, not all Wendy's have breakfast, which makes this location so special to me.  I am in love with the sausage gravy and biscuit, and honey chicken biscuit - and sometimes even wake up thinking about them. And getting them both for $5 is about as good as having grandma make breakfast. Not to mention they craft an artisal egg and havarti breakfast sandwhich with an aoli that really takes fast food to the next level...slow food?  Last but not least, the steel cut oatmeal with caramel apple makes eating healthy seem fun, and just another justification for coming here at least once a week for my fix."}
{"text":"These people are the nicest The food tastes better than in other Wendy's  Ill travel 14 miles just to get here instead of going to one 2 min from my house."}
{"text":"We need to work on our food business here, Wendy's (on Sharon Amity Rd. in Charlotte, NC). Maybe it was just a bad day for the employees but the entire ordering process was slow. Not because the line was backed but there was an inadequacy about the entire process, from ordering the food, to getting the food. The cashier seemed new or not adequately trained, countless food and drink orders were long, the time to get the food for each customer while I was there was very slow. This is not an patient/impatient thing, this was just, well, slow and many of the food orders were slow to get filled and they were very incorrect on top of that. They did seemed very well, adequately staffed so I am unsure as to what the problem is or if this is/was a 1 time fluke."}
{"text":"Most men in Vegas objectify women because it is socially accepted there. Not at this Wendy's! Walked into the store and was greeted by the funniest, friendliest, and most respectful worker ever! Jerry T took our orders, didn't judge me for wanting to try everything on the dollar menu, and checked in with us to make sure that our food was up to par.   The food didn't appear rushed. My Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger was properly aligned and stacked and my chicken nuggets were freshly fried!!! My friends ordered the bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun and raved about eating real meat at a fast food place!The food came out fast and it appeared the staff in the back were preparing food while I was paying. So rare to be able to experience quality like this. The restaurant was also clean and tidy. It appeared to be the stomping grounds of older women who were passing time or enjoying time with their friends. I watched Jerry T take food to other customers who had limited mobility. The restaurant truly values it's customers.   The only odd thing I noticed was that the soda machine was behind the counter and you had to ask to get a refill."}
{"text":"Been here many times, not one of which I received my whole order. Long wait in the drive thru and rude workers not willing to take the time to double check your order. Always a disappointment."}
{"text":"Literally the best Wendy's I've been to. They're friendly, fast, and my food was fresh. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Sam J. had it right.  This place is in the freaking hood.  The parking lot is scary as all get out.  We stopped here on the way home from a road trip with the kids and based on the parking lot and miscreants hanging out there in the middle of the day we were very skeptical to go in at all.  Once we did we were shocked to see that the inside was sparkling clean and the staff there more friendly than the Wendy's in my upper middle class neighborhood.  This place is a perfect example of not judging a book by the cover.  The food we well prepared.  The employees here take pride in their work for sure."}
{"text":"I visit this Wendy's pretty often just because I enjoy the food. The service is pretty bad most of the time that I order. Some of the cashiers I have had were pretty rude. Worst part is when I order take out they tend to cheap out big time. They give you minimal napkins for your meal. Also how do you order chilli and they \"forget\" to give you the hot sauce for it...This has happened more than 3 times to me. Once they even gave me 4 nuggets for a 5 nugget order. The food is great but the service needs to step it up. I would choose another Wendy's if it was more convenient. Gotta admit though the Spicy Chicken is my favourite sandwich/burger there and it beats the hell out of any fast food chicken sandwich. Too bad the service sucks nuts. Until next time, Jimstar out!! @Wendys #TerribleService"}
{"text":"I waited in the drivetru for 20+ minutes. The signs weren't even on. They took 5 minutes just to run my credit card. The food handler at the second window chatted for another 5 minutes with the customer after handing them the food. They didn't have baked potatoes. Had I not paid already, I would have left! Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This location is co-located with Timmys. I have always like Wendy's and this one is no different. The new wraps are very good but tiny."}
{"text":"Though this restaurant always seems to be busy, there's never a line. I don't think I've ever had to wait in a line longer than 2 people when I've come in here on the weekends.   The staff have always gotten my order bang on and they keep the dining area clean."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's!!! This location rocks because the employees are very courteous and kind. Very polite service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and they gave me the wrong order in the drive thru. They took a while and the employees were confused on what order was mine. I didnt check the bag and I got a chicken sandwich not a cheeseburger. I am never going to Wendys again in my life. I am on a healthy diet and decided to eat bad for one day and I got the wrong food. I am very pissed about this and not ever going to a fast food restaurant. Figures, should of stayed with my diet hahah NO cheat day for me."}
{"text":"Great location the stuff are nice and it's a great place to hang out and try the spicy chicken sandwich and the nachos and the fries it's so fresh and salty"}
{"text":"Great location and good stuff and they have great salad and you need to try the spicy chicken sandwich the change the $1.89 menu it's better"}
{"text":"When writing a review, I try to consider how well value, service, atmosphere, and food quality mix.  Wendy's is not Scaramouche.  Far from it.  However, this place delivers on all four of my points.  1. The service is amazingly friendly. When I eat here, I feel like they actually want me to come back.  Unlike many places in town, the service is not in the least rude (like many hipster places) or entitled (Tim Horton's).  2. The food is delicious.  The recently revamped burgers are much better.  It is also nice to be able to choose options besides fries, such as their chili which is high in fiber.  The menu is not super-extensive, but you can make healthy choices here as well as fried and typical fast food choices.  3. For the price, this place trounces McDonald's and similar places on taste and food quality.  For $8-$10 you can have a quick and delicious meal.  4. The store is a newer concept Wendy's.  There is a nice TV and a variety of seating options.  The place looks modern.  Beyond being new, they keep the restaurant clean.  Everything from the tables, to the restaurants, to the parking lot is much cleaner than the average fast food place."}
{"text":"Within the last couple of years, Wendy's announced (with great fanfare) a complete overhaul of its burger. Since that time they have backslid a bit. The new bun is still great, but the toppings are not as good.  That being said...  1. The restaurant has a nice layout. It could use a sign as you walk up Yonge toward Wellsley (you have to know where it is), but inside is nice. 2. The lady who cleans the dining room is one of the nicest people in the world. I regret not getting her name because she is awesome. 3. The food here is much better than McDonald's for the same price. 4. The mix n match drink machine is a nice feature. 5. The food is always hot. It seems like a simple thing, but fries that are not hot tend to suck. Good news here. No soggy fries."}
{"text":"While I did not find any foreign objects in my food, I did find some real problems here.  1. The lady who took my order and gave me my food was initially wiping down tables when I arrived. She went behind the counter, put her hands under running water for maybe one second, then took my order.  2. Behind the counter there were dried chili spills and other stains that were not from earlier than 1115 in the morning when I visited. The credit card machine had grime between all the keys. It had clearly never been cleaned. There was evidence of innate toon to cleanliness throughout. 3. My chicken sandwich had a glob of mayonnaise that was disproportionate to the sandwich. The lettuce was so warm and mushy that I could barely tell that it was lettuce.  I love Wendy's and their food, yet this one clearly suffers from a lack of training and supervision. I will not likely go back to this location."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's I have ever been to, and sadly it's the closest one to work. They can never ever ever get an order right and deeply needed to be educated on what gluten free means.  Update; it's 2018 and things have not changed. Lol"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!?  First I order a taco salad, they are out of salsa and chips  Then I order root beer. Out of that.  Then I order coke. Out of that.   Get to the window to pay and it's $14.14. I hand Jonathan a $20 and then say, \"I have 14 cents and he says \"it's too late I already put the $20 in\". I say \"the change would be $6\". Jonathan says \"I can't do that\"  What the hell!!    Wow"}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, I came across an article online promoting Wendy's new and improved french fries. I reflected back on 20+ years of reluctantly choosing their wet, soggy, greasy, medium-rare version of the American staple side order to accompany my burgers and nuggets. \"Finally,\" I thought. \"Bravo, Wendy's! Bravo!\"   The reprise version of these fries features sea salt seasoning with some skins left intact on the sides. Branded as \"Natural-Cut\", this hip, trendy new approach was designed to appeal to the sophisticated palate of the average \"Foodie.\"   The result: A wet, soggy, greasy, medium-rare version of the American staple side order smothered in sea salt.   Boo, Wendy's. Boo."}
{"text":"Can't buy a frostee in anything larger than the medium size cup and refused to let me fill my water bottle with the courtesy cups they provide because \"he was going to get busy and didn't want to\". Great job, this is a really good way to lose customers. I know this this is not a true reflection of Wendy's as a company, but to the company who franchises these location, I just want you to know that it is behaviors like this that will Ultimately lead to the failure of your business, and the fast food burger joints in general. It is a new generation of customers. Learn to adapt or you will fail Miserably at the hands of companies like Chipotle and Jimmy Johns. If you had any idea about basing your business around your customers and what their wants and needs are you might have a chance for survival. But you serve garbage food at an inflated price and expect people to pay for it because of your really cool ad campaign. Start treating people like people. I will never return to any Wendy's location for the rest of my life. And that is all it took was that one little negative experience that could have easily been avoided."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's in the city I would say!! Fries are always cold, the staff are always rude and in a rush, constantly making mistakes, giving the wrong change, messing up your order. I once waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes here..... Moral of the story, don't go here"}
{"text":"Dining room is a little dingy for a chain. Ripped seat cushions and a messy condiment bar. Drive through does not get orders exact ( e.g. Ask to hold the cheese ensures a hamburger with cheese)."}
{"text":"Yesterday I went through the Wendy's drive thru and ordered 5 chicken go-wraps, and a few other items including chili. Two of my three daughters as well as myself ate the chicken go wraps and my one daughter had the chili. Within an hour my oldest was very sick and was having diarrhea and vomiting. Then I got sick. Then in the middle Of the night my other daughter that ate the chicken got very sick. So the three that ate chicken all got food poisoning and the one that had chili is fine. I called and spoke to Scott the mgr who then called his boss, the GM Rita, who told him to tell me to go to the doctors if we were sick. That was it!!!!!!  No apology or way to remedy the situation. I told Scott they really needed to take a look at the batch of chicken they were using (or could STILL be using!) so that more people don't get sick! BEWARE ORDERING CHICKEN FROM WENDY'S! I've been in Dove Valley longer than Wendy's has even been here and we are fairly regular customers.  Not anymore!!!"}
{"text":"Oh Wendy's across the street from my high school.  You will always be the best Wendy's.  Thank you for all the Jr. Bacon Cheeseburgers and Spicy Chickens."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is a lunch hot spot! I love their Spicy Chicken Sandwich with an all natural lemonade. Their staff staff is organized and they get you your food fast. Don't be discouraged if the drive thru line is long either, it moves really quick."}
{"text":"Oh, don't have a cow, fast food and chain snobs, but I had as good a burger as I've ever had anywhere at any price today at  . . Wendy's.  The Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger.  Juicy, flavorful beef, really tasty  decently thick bacon, fresh, un-wilted fancy (anything other than iceberg) greens, with a rivulet of melted cheese running down the side.  I suppose it might have been pasteurized process cheese food substance, but regardless, the combination rivaled or surpassed any burger I've ever had at any price.  It even looked as advertised: no steamy half-smooshed bun sitting on a miniature version of what the ad photos look like.    As to health and nutrition, at 680 calories with 36 grams of fat, 46 grams of carbs and 1110 mg of sodium, nobody's claiming this is health food, but some folks just need to relax their taut, toned buttocks (They're judging me. I can feel them judging me) and enjoy a convenient burger done well now and then. Moderation, you know?  If it helps, focus on the 36 grams of protein and potassium.    As for the rest of the story, the dining area floor and tables were clean, and the young man at the counter this afternoon was actually friendly. I've seen a notable improvement in fast food customer service employees manners over the past 15 years in Phoenix, but still rarely do they rise above somewhat perfunctorily polite to the level of actually \"friendly\".  Granted that the mission of keeping fast food fast rarely allows for much in the way of customer interaction and the inside of the restaurant was not particularly busy mid-afternoon, but this was still a cut above. My compliments.    I wouldn't rate every Wendy's or everything AT Wendy's this highly, but for a single really good burger, a clean restaurant, and a few moments of personable interaction this day at this location, I'm a fan.  My compliments, and four stars."}
{"text":"Consistently terrible service. The drive-thru is slow and your order is often messed up - a terrible rendition of an otherwise good franchise."}
{"text":"Typical fast food Wendy's. I was famished and really needed just a snack, so I ordered spicy chicken nuggets/ I am not going to comment on how lackluster the flavor of the food was. That is a given at a chain. The associates were courteous. The restaurant was clean. I downgraded my \"famished\" state to slightly hungry.   Moving on to real food."}
{"text":"I really don't like fast food -- at all.  I was so hungry, though.  My belly was aching and the sugar rush from the donuts was wearing off.  There really wasn't anything else in the area other than the Dunkin Donuts and some fast food Chinese.  I know better than to eat fast food Chinese.  Ordered the Spicy Chicken sandwich with no lettuce and hoped for the best.    While the sandwich tasted like it had been sitting for a while, I was so hungry that it didn't taste bad.  Coupled with actual crunchiness I was very pleased with my 30 second feast.  Never really piquant, but at least it tastes better than the hamburgers."}
{"text":"Fresh and good...but I was starving.  I will obviously be returning since I have such a favorable memory.  I must say, though, my spicy chicken sandwich was fresh-out-of-the-fryer hot and very crispy while my bun was toasted.  The french fries were also fried to an artery clogging perfection."}
{"text":"Good god- I have no idea why I've stuck it out for so long in the Wendy's line, but I have a feeling that when I go to Arby's around the corner, I could go all of the way through the line get my food and drive past Wendy's again and still see the same cars in line. I waited for 15 minutes for 2 cars in front of me to only have to sit again at the speaker. More cars left the line then actually stayed and ordered food. If I owned this Wendy's I'd be furious thinking about how much business I'm losing. I'll stick to the Brookpark Wendy's next time."}
{"text":"My double stack only had one pickle on it.  Other than that, bomb af per usual and worth every overpriced penny."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love Wendy's. I love their chicken sandwiches and I love that their chili is turkey chili, and I was so excited that my new apartment was located near one.   But then the excitement stopped because this is the worst Wendy's I've ever been to. I've been to Wendy's in the middle of no where while on road trips that were better than this one.   They mess up my order almost every time. Even when I try and help them out. I don't like mayo. So I asked for no mayo on my sandwich. They put mayo. So the next time I told them I was allergic to mayo and to please make sure there is no mayo on the sandwich...  but there was still mayo.   I don't feel like this is a hard request, yet they can't get it right. I gave them 5 separate tries and they got it right once. Now I only go there for a frosty every once in a while, and I'm surprised they can even get that right.   Such a shame."}
{"text":"James at Wendy's is fantastic! He worked with urgency and such wonderful positive guest service! He offered to me some water without me even asking! And he made great suggestions for my meal. Thank you for making my airport wait great!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is my favourite fast food burger joint but I miss the days, from way back in time, that they had a salad bar. Yes, a salad bar! Am I giving away my age?  Square burger patties and all, my favourite items are the Bacon Deluxe and Baconator (because everything is better with bacon), Chili, and the Frosty. I do occasionally try other items but keep coming back to my faves.  This location is relatively close to home, making it convenient to stop in. Unfortunately, the one thing that bugs me about this location is the consistently poor service. It always takes a long time to get served, making me wonder if this is really fast food.  On this visit, I came for just a Frosty to soothe a sore throat. It's the perfect balance between milkshake and ice cream, too thick for a straw but too soft for a cone, and perfectly soothing. I stood at the counter for a couple of minutes, waiting for somebody to take my order. There was nobody ahead of me and no staff at the counter. I could see other staff working in the open kitchen and servicing the drive-through but none of them stepped up.  I eventually got served but couldn't help feeling frustrated that the service hasn't improved over the years that I've been coming here. There definitely seems to be a lack of interest from the counter staff but is it a lack of training? I really hope this changes soon."}
{"text":"The customer service here was so bad, I was trying to order my food and there were staff laughing and not focused on there job. I had 3 of the employees trying to take my order and when I said something they refused to give me service, sorry Wendy's but McDonald's is better"}
{"text":"Yes, a fast food review because it's just that bad. I hate to say that II'll probably still go occasionally since this is right by my work, but \"fast\" food, this is not.  I once waited 30 minutes, no joke, to place and recieve my order. Today I waited in the drive through for 15 minutes with 3 cars in front of me. They seem to constantly be understaffed and hiring at this location and they are not moving quickly at all to keep up with the demand."}
{"text":"This is the best fast food spot in the area- too bad it isnt 24hr!  They always get your order right- ive really never had them make a mistake.  The staff is always courteous and efficient. My food is always neatly packed with napkins, utensils, and the proper condiments.  Ive never got a stale bun, or a flat pop. My poutine is never short on any ingredient.  Consistency is key!!! Way to keep me coming back! :D"}
{"text":"People here work really fast but I can tell they really hate their job. Dropped by for a quick meal and got out super fast. That's the only good part. The entire process felt like they wanted me to leave asap. No smile, no conversation, no ketchup, soggy fries, annoyed looks, slow body movement...you can imagine the depressing atopmsphere. The burger was what you would expect from Wendy's. But at least, I got out of there in no time. Yikes."}
{"text":"Didn't get good service @9:20 A.M. Lady had an attitude in drive through and had a nose piercing on . Didn't even give me receipt , lack of customer service when I asked for ranch she rolled her eyes and walked away"}
{"text":"this place is absolutely disgusting and such a shame for a nice building from the time I pulled in the parking lot until the end of my dining experience I was absolutely appalled I was a long time Wendy's loyal and now I'm so disgusted I don't believe I could ever eat there again and not just that location all locations in general as I pulled in the parking lot 2 employees appeared to be taking out the trash and smoking pot at the dumpsters as I went inside there was only 2 tables seated and every other table and the entire restaurant was disgusting covered in filth after ordering and receiving a drink cups the drink station was absolutely out of a horror movie trash soda sticky everywhere ketchup blob all over the counter I decided to take a couple pictures because surely there has to be some sort of code violation what I saw one of the employees in the back say that fool is taking pictures out there and through majority of my meal I was being stared at by the employees instead of cleaning they just kept staring there was at least six employees on staff and the place was an absolute shambles good luck and good-bye Wendy's"}
{"text":"Had a pleasant experience here the first time I went, so gave it another try after my 2nd visit was horrible. The third experience was just worse. The girl was extremely rude, I asked for a ranch at the window and she proceeded to moan out an OK, rolled her eyes, and heavily sighed as she closed the window. They were also all out of green tea and asked that I wait 5 minutes as they brewed a new batch. 5 minutes turned into 20. Furthermore, I opened my baked potato and the inside was black and completely rotten.  No quality control of their products or proper training of their employees."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast at 09:20 on 09/05/2015.... lights were on, cars in parking lot.... place was closed. Sat in the drive through for a couple minutes.... nothing. Went to McDonald's across the street instead. Apparently Wendy's doesn't open until 10am. Seriously?! Geez."}
{"text":"The food was average Wendy's fare, the service was ok. The thing that got to me was the ladies bathroom.     There was hair in the sinks. Both sinks. Not a stray hair. A bunch of hair. Like someone who was balding had brushed their hair while leaning over the sinks. I actually gagged. The hand dryer wasn't working either.     You can tell a lot about an establishment by the state their bathrooms are in."}
{"text":"By far the worst Wendy's I've ever been to. Both to dine in and drive thru. My son and I dined in once and witness a black male harassing a fellow black female coworker. Despite bringing it up to her, I assume, manager it continued. Anytime I'm in the drive thru it takes forever. I can only assume they can only serve 2 people at a time and I'm sitting at the order screen currently for 6 minutes. No idea why. There are no cars ahead of me, but a full convoy behind me. DRIVE ON to the west mifflin location. This one is a bust."}
{"text":"Suck, always slow close the lobby too early on the weekends. Cars backed up to the end of parking lot!!!"}
{"text":"This place drives me crazy. They are so inconsistent with service that I don't know what to give them. I only use the drive through after work but One day it's \"go ahead\" another it's \"welcome to Wendy's how can I help you\" one day the fries are cold and unsalted, another day they are hot and perfectly salted.  I wonder if this store is used to train new employees. There always seems to be something going on inside that slows the service down. I will look to a new Wendy's to meet my spicy chicken needs."}
{"text":"I don't often actually set foot into fast food restaurants. The drive thru is my usual M.O. Today I was looking to get a quick bite but the drive thru was 12 deep, easy. I had to think quick because I was on my way to work. So I steeled myself and went in.  It's been a very long time since I went into a Wendy's. I was super impressed with the dining room. Very modern, very clean, and it was the middle of lunch hour.   I was greeted  and welcomed by two employees almost immediately. The cashier Miss Danisha I believe it was, was very nice. I even tested her by saying \"may I trouble you for a number 6\"? Her response \"It's no trouble at all\" meaning she was actually paying attention to my words, and not on autopilot.    What tripped me out was the soda machine. So futuristic I almost had to ask for help. Too many choices.   My food came out lightning quick. Not bad, not great.   I just wanted to recognize the staff at this berewick location. Nice job"}
{"text":"Disappointed with this Wendy's, we came through the drive-thru and got 3 meals. One of the sandwiches were really cold and the chili was half full with a piece of plastic in it. It was ridiculous! My father could've choked on the piece of plastic which have caused a whole another set of problems. I called the store and had to wait at least 4 mins before anybody answered and the manager who talked to me didn't even apologize, he just asked me when we could come in. Really bad customer service and definitely not going there again!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this Wendy's a 10 I would! Great staff, very friendly and one of the finest establishments I've been to in reference to fast food! Newly upgraded tv and usb outlets that you can use to charge your phone!! 10/10 will recommend!"}
{"text":"I don't know how intelligent you have to be to work here but apparently you don't have to be intelligent in the slightest. Had to pull up front, as long as 5 other cars... just for my order to be incorrect and cold. The only way I would eat here again would be if it was free or a friend bought it for me. Absolutely ridiculous God help those 5 other cars and their incorrect orders"}
{"text":"Please oh please do yourself a favor! Dont't eat here. Upon walking in the corridor rank smells of filth and uncleanliness smacked me in the face. Why I still walked up to the counter to order while holding back the look of disgust I had in my face is beyond me. It appeared to be two or three employees struggling to serve about 30 patrons. While standing in line I also noticed the slovenly and unkempt area where they make and prep the food. How surprised I was to see such a disgusting Wendy's. Shame on you Wendy's for allowing one of your establishments to operate in this way. After two or three minutes I walked out!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I've ever been to I thought this was a fast food establishment but they tend to take 20 minutes to bring our food to us and even with that time they forget to give us almost half our meal this happened a while  ago but I'm still mad about it I give them chance after chance but they never succeed."}
{"text":"They need to close this location or get some new staff including management. The Hispanic guy that must be a manager is really rude. His stone face that he gives his customers is not professional. All the other staff performance is completely horrible and poor. I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Giving it a 1 star for the time being. I went to use the drive-thru and sat unmoving for about 10 minutes before i gave up. There was 4 cars in line at the order menu and no cars at the windows and no one moved the whole time. At least 4 cars before me gave up before i finally did too. Store was open just apparently wasn't taking an drive thru orders for the time.  If i go back and have a better experience i'll be sure update this review, but until then it's gonna be a 1 star."}
{"text":"Another review with 1 star because you can't give NO STARS!  They DONT understand direction very well(at all for that matter)!   Greasy fries, mayo(when you ask for no mayo, ask for 3 DIET sodas & what do you get?? ROOT BEER! Even after they verify that \"You wanted diet, right?\"  They don't even have DIET ROOT BEER!   Constant customers NO MORE!!"}
{"text":"Average Wendy's. Nothing special about it. I haven't had any issues with this location. I'll be going back there in the future."}
{"text":"Average Wendy's restaurant. The food was good and on par with any other Wendy's. No complaints, just watch out when you go. It being so near the community college it can get busy during the week around lunch time."}
{"text":"Good food as usual at Wendy's!  Prompt friendly service at the drive thru. Have eaten lunch there twice in 3weeks. I will continue to eat at this location often."}
{"text":"I couldn't believe it -- I had breakfast at this location not long ago and it was great ( as far as fast food is concerned) however last Friday after helping our Son move all day long we went to this Wendy's for a late dinner -- Like 8:30P -- We had a couple burgers and fries. A couple of the new Ciabatta Bacon Cheeseburgers== The bread on the Ciabatta was so stale the top of the bun cracked when touched-- The meat patties on the burgers were luke warm and basically tasteless-- I found out why-- the kids working the place had pre-cooked a whole stack of patties on the grill and were using those to make the sandwiches-- BLAH-- One f the push button soda machines was putting our nothing but carbonated water-- We told them== they replied that they knew it and instructed us to use the other machine--( no sign -- no apology)- We don't know if it was the young group running the place or was I close to closing ?? What we do know is it will be a long time before we return-- Shameful"}
{"text":"Been sick all day after eating here. The burger was so greasy that the sandwich felt like mush, u havr never had a mushy, totally disgusting. There was a piece of bacon that was hard and not edible. The fries were stale and old. I threw out half the meal and my stomach started turning within 15 minutes. It's now 6 hours later and I have just finished vomiting. I'll never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here! I got the good ol' classic Dave's Single with cheese combo. They added bacon to it like I requested and it was delicious! They did a good job with the fries too. The restaurant was also clean and the cashier was nice. I will continue going to this place."}
{"text":"Great service! Friendly cashier. Food was very good. Place was clean. I'll admit that I was a little worried about this place before I went inside. This Wendy's is located across the street from a Food City, liquor store, cash advance place, and a Dollar General (usually not a good combination). There were a few shady characters in the parking lot, but none of them accosted me."}
{"text":"The Baconator I got here was awesome! My order was processed quickly and accurately. My only complaint about this place was that there was trash on the floor and a few of the tables were dirty. Otherwise, I had a pleasant dining experience here."}
{"text":"Just do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs. Consistently terrible. Let's start with the sanitation score of 90.  Followed by waiting so long that your shoes are stuck to the nasty sticky floor. This place is a disgrace. Stood in line with 2 people in front of me. It was my turn, and continued to wait another 5 minutes and still didn't have my order taken. None of the orders before me had been fulfilled. And the line grew to another 4 people behind me. Pretty sure only 3 people working. And so understaffed and lack of presence at the counter, that a fellow person in line asked if there was anyone working. Finally fed up with it, we walked out and we won't be walking back into the establishment."}
{"text":"Oh my - had to repeat my order 4x after waiting 5 minutes to wait to order.   Get the order and they short me a burger.  I will find a new place....did I mention they forgot my drink too."}
{"text":"Their dining room is closed yet it STILL takes forever in the drive through. What is going on???"}
{"text":"Wendys has gone down since 10 years ago! Bad tasteless soggy burgers! Went to this location had paid 7.45 for 1 cheeseburger and a lousy coke!! McDonald's was across the street and busy most of time, this place was empty and know why!!! Never again!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here a long time. It started to go down hill. Ive only been going if I forget my lunch bc it's close to my work. But no more. Today I asked for two doublestacks no mustard. They gave me mustard and no pickles or onions. I like a few of the employees bc I know them. But I'm done. I will drive somewhere farther."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is always my choice when I want a burger. I have been going here for years. The employees are always nice and the food is always great. Besides, I love the frostys. I just had the new Taco Salad and I am so happy it is back!"}
{"text":"Tried going twice. Twice i got a \" were closed\" i said i thought you were open till 1? \"Nah\" it was 12. I thought Wendy's advertises that they're open until 1? Like thats their commercial campaign. Guess not. Cant rate the food cause i haven't received any. I would have loved to try. But since its 1210 guess they are closed. Don't worry Wendy's. Maybe you should add 100+ sodas to this location but don't worry i wont have any from this one or any. I am done w this franchise."}
{"text":"By far the worst experience I have ever had at Wendy's you walk in garbage all over the floor as you're ordering your food the manager walks up to the cashier and says when you're finished with this one I need to talk to you as you're waiting for your food you see garbage all over the floor you get your order fries or called you asked for another fries because they are called you ask for new ones they are called as well you get attitude for asking for a hot fries at during this time your burger is getting cold because you chose to get the food to go in the drive-through was backed up after this experience I doubt I will ever go until Wendy's again I would like to see from the Wendy's to contact me but we all know they don't care about customer service as long as they get their money in the first place"}
{"text":"They forgot my sauce that I requested twice for my chicken nuggets.   Also, they forgot to give me my debit card. I called once I realized they didn't give me my credit card and they said they didn't have it. I kept looking for my card thinking maybe it dropped in my car. I called back about an hour later and they said they had it...after I cancelled it with my bank. So annoyed. Customer Service has to be better. I have to say I have never not been given my debit card by a drive thru. NEVER going here again."}
{"text":"How hard is it to get an order right???  I ordered my meal with NO MAYO. Get back to the office and guess what?  They put extra mayo on my burger. Seriously??  Quit goofing off and do your job. If you can't provide good customer service, i.e. provide the correct order then management needs to get employees who will provide the right order and good customer service."}
{"text":"This is the MOST unprofessional Wendys store #3367  I have ever been to.  The cashier in the drive had NO customer service skills at all, laughing and all in the speaker while I was ordering.  Plus the 1st & 2nd drive through window workers both was wearing wave caps on & these are the face of your business. Yes wave caps which blew my mind when I saw that. I mean not tied up at all which to me looked so unprofessional.  This store truly puts s black eye on Wendys.  Who ever owns this franchise truly needs to get a secret shopper in there to help his business out."}
{"text":"No breakfast out of nowhere. Closest Wendys for breakfast is 59th and Thunderbird"}
{"text":"Food poisoning!! Do not go here. Went threw the drive threw last night at 530, by 930 my friend and I, who both had the same thing, were dying. Even called the health dept the symptoms were so bad, filed complaints etc. Its 930am now and if the symptoms don't stop, both in incredible pain, going to the hospital, it's been 12 hours of non stop symptoms. Wendy's will certainly get the bill! The employee at the window was rude and she practically tossed the bag out the window, the meat tasted old - was very over seasoned maybe to mask the taste, fries were awful limp, nothing was warm, certainly did not want to see any of it again fifteen+ times three hours later. Have also noticed other reviews talking about food quality, cleanliness and not feeling well after eating here. It's awful."}
{"text":"Very clean. David Lugo has great customer service very polite and freindly...food was great and loved my mango peach drink"}
{"text":"This Wendys has closed, and I am so sad.  It is, or I guess, was, the best Wendys in Calgary and was only a few blks. from my apt. I even called them a couple of times or the past few yrs. to compliment them.  Always hot and fresh and just delicious. And the service was fast and super smiley/friendly.  Wow, you guys, you'll be missed."}
{"text":"Sadly my highly anticipated ice cold cod fish sandwich was colder than the lettuce beside it; this means it was in the freezer and it was yanked from the oven. However my chive and sour cream was reasonable. I forgot how tasty a baked potato can taste when it is prepared properly."}
{"text":"First time I ever had a bad chicken sandwich at Wendy's.  The chicken was tough and dry and kind of stringy.  How old was this bird anyway?  They're going to have to do better than that with all the competition around.  I'm in no hurry to go back to that Wendy's."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this location in a month. Its right there w/ where I regularly get gas during lunch. You would think that w/ it being right next to Carowinds and its the summertime that it would be faster during lunch time .   Today's visit was not any different. They only had one person taking orders at 12:30 and the drive thru had like 4 cats waiting for orders to be taken. Workers behind the counter didn't know what people ordered so they were confused.   If this place wasn't connected to the gas station I like to use, I would go across the street to Subway or drive 5 min more to the McDs when I want a burger.  I mean prime location and they're taking advantage of people they know will come here because of their location."}
{"text":"Service has just gone down hill at this location. I hate since it's so close to the office. I'm done."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place five stars, because some asshole gave it one star just because he got mayonnaise on his burger."}
{"text":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. They were out of soda or really their carbonation and out of ketchup. Don't understand how you run a restaurant like that. I'm guessing poor management."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am Yelping a Wendy's... that's how AWFUL it was!  I have been here before for a burger and it was okay. Today I decided to try the fish sandwich...huge mistake! It was old, cold (cheese wouldn't melt), chewy and rubbery on the outside edges and the inside was almost gray! It was nasty! To top it off, the drive-thru gal was not friendly and obviously didn't want to be there. It is close to my work, but I will not go here for lunch again. It was a waste of my time, money and calories! Ugh."}
{"text":"Located in the Food Court at Fashion Show Mall.  Got our order quick!  Kids love the Frosty's here, it's a regular stop for us when we are on this end of the mall.  Customer service forgettable."}
{"text":"Berry salad now on the menu and its so fabulous and healthy.  Selection of berry ice-teas. My favorite is the berry lemonade and the kids love the frosty's!"}
{"text":"Excellent visit today. Ordered a couple frostys some fries nuggets and burgers. The order came out very quick and the burgers were customized to how I like them. The bacon was warm crispy and delicious. The frys were hot and fresh. I would recommend that management look into their cashiers. Having one saying he is tired, doesn't want to be there, and complaining to all the customers will not be good for business."}
{"text":"The only reason they get two stars is because at least it's convenient to my home. Otherwise, I do not understand how they screw up a drive-through order four out of every five times I come through here. That scene in lethal weapon was made for this drive thru. Check your order every time.  Seriously. I wish whomever trains the crews at Chick-fil-A could contract out and train every other fast food restaurant. I've been coming here for years and it's always been a train wreck. I don't know if it's turnover in management, staff or just the nature of the beast, but this is my least favorite fast food restaurant to visit."}
{"text":"Just your average fast food joint.  Came right up to my expectations."}
{"text":"25 minute wait for two small frosties...are you kidding me!?! This is not the first time...I live in the neighborhood. It's nice to be in a great location with guarenteed new customers from the hospital across the street because most will not return after the long wait and the VERY unapologetic and apathetic staff. Jack, Two Hippies, Lucky Boy, Whataburger, and Culvers are much better choices in the area (I don't eat at mc d, but they are close too)."}
{"text":"I have tried stopping by in the morning a few times before work, however they never open on time.  We recently went there for a quick bite to eat & the only drink you could get was lemonade or tea.  This would not have been an issue if they told us prior to ordering or refunded our money for the drinks.  It was not even close to being busy but we had to wait about 15 mins for our food and only to have it messed up.  Once it was brought to their attention they did fix it quickly."}
{"text":"This particular Wendy's has become a regular stop for us at lunchtime when we are in West Mifflin.  There are lots of other places to grab a quick bite to eat, but we've kind of fallen in love with the staff at this location because these kids are really friendly and fun, and our food is always prepared right.  Wendy's has always had good, reasonably priced fast food, and since I'm trying to watch my weight, I really appreciate the fact that they have some pretty nice salad offerings.  The BBQ Ranch Chicken Salad is my favorite.  The Asian Cashew Chicken Salad is also very good, but I wish they would bring back the cobb salad, which I miss.  My favorite item on the menu is the Asiago Ranch Chicken Club Sandwich (with spicy chicken) and I am a big fan of Wendy's french fries, which far surpass the fast food industry standard.  And of course, when I'm feeling like having a dessert, a small chocolate frosty is just enough to top off the lunch.  This is not gourmet food, but it's really good fast food served by nice people who have a great attitude about their customers.  That seems to be a rare thing at fast food joints these days, so either this manager is doing something right in his hiring practices, or he has gotten very lucky the past couple of years!  I would have gone \"all in\" on this review and given the restaurant 5 stars except for the fact that over the winter months, it is often unacceptably cold in the dining room, and I've noticed a couple of times that the floor near the entrance was slippery.  The place is kept clean, but I think somebody might have been using the same mop water for the dining room floor that was used on the kitchen floor, and that is a definite no-no."}
{"text":"Hit and miss on the food here, mine was OK and my wife's was terrible. Not a place to go if you like your food fresh cooked. Our food was on the counter about 30 seconds after we ordered which tells me they pulled it all out of a warmer, threw it together and placed it on a tray at lightning speed. I can appreciate the fact that it's a \"fast food\" restaurant but I went for breakfast and it doesn't take that long to cook an egg."}
{"text":"I don't usually review fast food but this Wendys was much better than the reviews would have led me to believe.  Food was fast and fresh, served by employees who at least pretended to be happy to be there Restaurant was very clean during the lunch hour as well.  Im sure like all fast food its hit or miss, but on my visit they hit a home run"}
{"text":"I usually don't Yelp about fast food. But it was Wendy's man! Wendy's has never let me down...I was shocked. I ordered a Baconater sandwich and 4 piece chicken strip. And she said over the drive thru mic \"are you sure you don't want the nuggets instead?\" I told her no...I want the strips I've never had them and the picture looks good. She said \"I only have four left\"..I said \"I'll take em!\" I noticed on the menu they were two bucks more for the four piece instead of the three.  I got to the window.  I paid 14.56 for those two items.  My son's burger was literally dripping crazy bad mayo all over and the chicken strips were the worst I've ever had. She only gave me three and they were hard as rocks and I stopped eating them because it was so bad and also fearful I would get sick tonight ..so.. I basically paid 15 bucks for nothing but a belly ache  and of course she didn't supply napkins or a receipt. Sorry Wendy's on Juanita street! But y'all need to step it up !   Update! I gave it 25 mins and I'm so so sick !!"}
{"text":"Ordered Bacon Natter fries and got a lump of old fries with one piece of bacon on it. Nuggets were old and service took forever"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite of lunch after visiting Palms and the service here is really stellar. The clerk took our order and fulfilled it as well. Our order was up after placing it and was fresh before I could fill my drink cup up. At even 2:30 pm in the afternoon it was fresh and made to order. I am so impressed and would come to this Wendy's just for the service.  I ordered two 4 for 4 meal deals and I love that Wendy's let's the customer choose the sandwich too. This meal deal is so worth the price too. The sandwiches that I choose were the junior bacon cheeseburgers with no tomato. The burgers were well cooked and just as I ordered. The fries were hot and fresh too. For dessert it was small chocolate frosties and on a hot afternoon it hits the spot."}
{"text":"This is my first visit here since the remodel on this particular Wendy's, and what a design decor upgrade they gave this location. Bravo. I remember how rundown and so very plain the old store was. The design of this store is even different than other Wendy's throughout the valley that have been remodeled. I love how the owners designed this location in such a square way. It is so perfect.   The employees are some of the most upbeat and attentive staff that I have ever seen. They ensure that all the guest needs are met and it is performed with such personalized perfection. I ended of ordering the 4 for 4 menu with a jr bacon as my burger choice. Also salad was on the menu for me and enjoyed a Caesar salad and a Cobb salad that I split up between myself and the twins. I would revisit this store just to be in the company of such competent and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch, and it has been awhile. With the restaurant just opening around 10:30 am, one can get in and out soon. Surprisingly, this store must have a lot of fans since the lobby was pretty busy and there were other patrons that desired Wendy's as much as we did.  With the expansion of their 4 for 4 meal we decided to try the Jr Bacon and chicken sandwich too. Everything was fresh and made to our liking not the \"way\" it comes. And they got our food order right the first time. Such success! The staff was very attentive to their guests needs and were cleaning as needed tables for guests. Thanks Wendy's on Arville for having fabulous staff."}
{"text":"Worst location I've ever been to.  I ordered a cheeseburger plain and small fries.  I opened to find they put everything on it, the burger was cold, the cheese wasn't melted and there were pickles, I hate pickles!  The fries were lukewarm.  I can't believe these people expect$15 an hour when they don't listen and can't get a simple order right."}
{"text":"We visited this Wendy's and we frequent this one about once a month, but this month the crew as I walked up to the register complained another customer. And maybe the crew was having a bad day or sometimes just don't want to work you must fake it.  Our order was correct but if did not check our 3 potatoes would not of had sour cream or butter , that would be bad. In the end food was fresh and not all the way cold so it was a win win."}
{"text":"Only gotta wait 15 minutes for the 2 people ahead of you to place their orders, and then your order will be F'ed right up.   Pure incompetence here."}
{"text":"Baconator.  The end.  No seriously, though... as far as fast food goes, Wendy's has the highest quality sandwiches in my opinion, and as far as Wendy's Restaurants go, this is one of the better ones.  Super friendly staff, and they are a well-oiled machine behind the counter.  I'll echo what Kevin said over four years ago (LOL... I can't believe two people have felt compelled to Yelp about a Wendy's)... the consistency of a Spicy Chicken Sandwich is of paramount importance.  Always good at this Wendy's."}
{"text":"Literally some of the worst service I've ever had the dissatisfaction of encountering.  Coming off a ten hour shift all I wanted was to pick up some quick food and head home. I order and pull up to the window. She has me pay then after five minutes of waiting at the window she asks me to pull up and park to wait for my food.  Completely understandable.  I pull up and wait. During my fifteen minute wait for a chicken sandwich five cars have since pulled through gotten their food instantly and gone about their nights.  Hangry and more than irritated at this point I pull up and ask for my money back and the managers acts like I'm in the wrong...?  \"Fast\" Food should not be this hard.  **Side note I went to Taco Bell and got my food in under five minutes.** five stars for you Taco Bell!"}
{"text":"Service was quick & fast. I ordered a 4pc chicken tender w/ a medium fry. It was a whopping $10 bucks. YIKES... Anyway, the food was fresh & hot. I can definitely appreciate that. I was pressed for time & was starving, that's the only reason I came here. Good to know they're here if it's crunch time!"}
{"text":"Got two sandwiches and some chicken nuggets. Asked for honey mustard and honey.  Currently sitting at home sauceless. Who wants chicken nuggets with no sauce?"}
{"text":"One of the worst Wendy's locations in Las Vegas.  I can not remember them ever getting my order right from leaving out things to forgetting straws and napkins.  I get the impression they just don't care at all.  Bad customer service.  Dirty bathrooms.  The place is ghetto.  Do not go there.  I wish it was better, but it's just not.  You are much better off going to Arbys or anywhere."}
{"text":"Fast food.... NOT.  Big corporate America places only get one shot w us. We came here cause we got stuff to do, quick trip to TARGET, try to get child fed quickly and to bed on time. SO LETS STOP AT Wendy's, right? Quick?  Swing and miss. Never again."}
{"text":"Way to fail, Wendy's!   I saw a commercial for baked sweet potatoes last night and decided to swing by Wendy's for lunch today to get one. I was also picking up another one for my coworker, two chicken ceaser wraps, and a salad.   I went at 11:30, just before the 'standard' lunch time. Wendy's only had one sweet potato available. The lady taking my order thought I said I wanted chicken ceaser sandwiches. I corrected her, but I still ended up with the sandwiches instead of the wraps in my bag. Glad I checked the bag before driving off!"}
{"text":"Super slow! Do not come here if you value your time!! And my food was cold! Unacceptable!!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good unfortunately the service is not! The drive threw takes FOREVER! Even if I'm the only car in the drive threw! Fast food? Not really!"}
{"text":"First off the food was lame, some of my fries were still cold as if they were partially frozen. My wifes sandwhich looked as though someone sat on it a week ago and then to top it all off an employee used the rest room same time as my wife and the employee did not wash her hands!  Disgusting!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is a very good fast food joint. It tops its competitors by a million. Love the frostys"}
{"text":"First and last time going to this Wendy's. Please read the yelp reviews. They are not capable of getting a order correct. Wish I read reviews before driving across town to pay for food I didn't get."}
{"text":"Lizette was so nice.   I wasn't sure what I wanted and she was so helpful.   I'll be back and it was my first time here"}
{"text":"First time through this Wendy's and the drive-thru took 10 minutes with only 3 cars. Our drinks were wrong both in size and soda type. We also had two wrong burgers -which were supposed to be plain..I don't understand why that is so hard.  However, the worker at the drive-thru was friendly -even though when we told her our drink was wrong... she tried to tell us it was right.  They corrected our order as quick as she could with a smile. Our new sandwiches came out fresh and correct."}
{"text":"You can really tell that Dave Thomas is dead.  Who the hell is running this company?  The double cheese burger I ordered was dryer than salted pretzels!  The big sales pitch was how moist the \"never frozen\" burgers were!!  It will be a Very long time before I'm going through that place again."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's but this was ridiculous. There was at least 8 people I front of me waiting to order their food and the cashier was so clueless. If it was his first day then I understand but at least have someone help him. I waited exactly 20 mins to order. And then I had to get a new drink because he was holding my cup with his hand inside the cup and rubbing inside of it. Gross. Then no one made fries. He said I had to wait for someone to put the fries on. Like if you see 10+ people waiting in line, wouldn't you make fries? I've been a returning customer because I love Wendy's. I've seen it when the letter grading was a \"B\" and a \"C\" rating. Now it's an \"A\" but it'll probably change. There's even a guy who works there that wears a SnapBack hat. Not a Wendy's hat."}
{"text":"This is the fastest Wendy's ever! I've never had bad service and my orders are always perfect. -1 star because it almost scares me how fast the food comes out.  But if you're going to be eating fast food... there are far worse things to worry about. Speaking of which, Wendy's has a few good items for when i'm looking to grab \"healthier\" fast food. Their salads are loaded and tasty, I also like the non-breaded chicken tenders. But occasionally I just come through for a speedy Frosty late at night.. always meets expectations."}
{"text":"Can I give it 0 stars?  Negative 5 stars?  This location is by far the worst Wendy's I have ever been to.  The customer service is awful.  Just awful.  It's like they don't give a crap.  And this isn't a one time oops moment...I went there on three separate occasions (it was unfortunately a convenience thing) and each time the service was worse than the time before.    I have so much more that I can say about this FAIL of an establishment, but I won't waste my time.  Don't bother going here.  Your order will be wrong and you will be treated like you are bothering the employees when you try to get it corrected.    And if any management happens to see this review....please know that this branch is in serious need of some training, guidance and better management."}
{"text":"I know, I know: Wendy's? FOUR stars? Yes and yes. I rarely review places like this but I had such a fantastic experience that I needed to let the Yelperverse know about it. This is an old school Wendy's, meaning it's not fancy, it's pretty worn down and worn out, and it's in a not-so-nice part of town. So imagine my surprise when I came here and not only was it spotlessly clean (two employees were constantly wiping down tables), it was packed with obvious regulars (lots of old timers and a chatty fellow in line behind us who informed us as such).   It's clear that many of the employees here are \"lifers,\" meaning they always have and / or always will work for Wendy's. That means they are super efficient and true superstars of the fast food chain. The older lady took our order (we had lots of substitutions) with zero issues and got it 100% correct the first time.   When our food arrived, we were both shocked. This was hands down the best Wendy's food we'd had in a long, long time. The burgers were hot and fresh and perfectly seasoned, the buns were fluffy, the cheese was melting and gooey, and the produce was so high quality that if you didn't know better you'd guess it was from a higher end burger restaurant. The lettuce was crisp and not brown nor wilted, the pickles were perfect, and my super red and ripe tomatoes were sliced uniformly. I can't say enough about how great this burger was.   It's fine, but there were several homeless people (and one mentally ill man) hanging out in the parking lot in broad daylight (at 1:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon). They didn't intend to harm anyone, but one of them came inside and started walking around and talking to random customers, disappearing into the restroom (he never came back out before I left and the employees didn't ask him to leave). For that, I had to dock them one star. People were freaking out and feeling uncomfortable, so I would recommend this location get some better security or manager training so they can better deal with situations like this.   For obvious reasons, I'd suggest you use the drive thru window instead of choosing to dine in. But this is a dang good Wendy's!"}
{"text":"I ate at the one in T-4 by gate B 4 at Sky Harbor yuk it was not good food was barely warm. That is my last visit to a Wendy's chain!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I know it's a fast food place so you can't really have very high expectations when going there. But no matter what they need to high better staff. Drive through staff is rude. They don't greet you upon driving up to the window you can wait minutes before they even open the window to greet you. They don't converse with when they do open the window for two seconds at a time. And right now what they are doing a .50¢ frosty special and my boyfriend and I went to get one and when we pulled up to the window the lady asked what we would like we tell her and then you hear her laugh and say \" we don't have frostys now\" and then proceeded to  take the remainder of our order. Now I understand being out of things I have worked in fast food then was a server and customer service is all about the way you present what your saying/treating your customers and don't get me wrong the food here is not bad it's just the customer service you'd have to deal with during your visit."}
{"text":"IT FREAKING AWFUL!!!!! A big guy keep laugh for  no reason and keep laugh and point to some wall or something behind the soda machine and keep laugh and move around laugh and I sit wait for my one more order and I keep said wave wave and no one come until That man finally come and I said with big thanks for finally attention to me and said one more large fries and he was like ohh walk off and send someone over and we again said miss large fries and finally bring me one and I said with big hand talk blah blah so need something abt that man!!!"}
{"text":"Nuked re-heated burger - eve if it is meant to be value it still needs to be edible. Cheese stuck to paper - no condiments - seriously onion pickle ketchup NOT that much. Too many good burger places around to eat here."}
{"text":"Got the spicy chicken sandwhich and it was great. I'm yelping however because I drove off and forgot my change. I was eating in the parking lot in my car and the cashier ran up and said sir you forgot your $13.00 I never would have known. She could have easily kept it. Very cool!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 Large chocolate frosty's; they were very good but the Manager was very rude. No hello, Hi, anything just the barked out the cost of the product. I handed her my card and she snagged it out my hand. Gave me my 2 frosty's and my card and just walked away. I didn't even receive a receipt. She made me feel it was a bother that I made such an atrocious order. Horrible customer service, I'll go to the jack in the box across the street from now on."}
{"text":"They are very nice and very helpful and the food is superb"}
{"text":"Tried to dine in last night since drive thru line was super long and the doors were locked at 8:50. Sign said open til 9. Only been to this location once before and ordered a chicken nugget and fry which both tasted like they had been siting out all day."}
{"text":"The Jalapeño Fresco sandwich is awesome....with ghost pepper cheese sauce, red jalapeño bun, onions and chopped jalapeños ....it's got a kick to it. Issue at this location is service. We went in today and someone working drive through looked our way and walked away. Another employee was in the back really doing nothing, while a manager was conducting what appeared to be inventory. There were two of us, another person who followed us in, and ultimately another customer. Think that would warrant someone coming out to take our orders? Evidently not. After waiting a few minutes, a mature female employee came out to take our order. She should not be dealing with customers. She went to the register and just stared at us....we asked if we could place our order and she just smiled...no greeting, no \" what can I get you\", no interaction at all. We really seemed to be an annoyance to her.  Once we placed our order ...she got our pop and water, then put the chicken sandwiches down, then got our fries, which she flung onto the tray...which she then proceeded to push our way. No thank you, no here's your order...nothing. I think the only words she said to us throughout the entire transaction was the price of our order, and she asked what we wanted to drink. Just awful service. Most likely won't be back to this location anymore....."}
{"text":"Came at about 10:30 pm on May 25, got told to \"hold on\" right when I pulled up to the drive through. Had to be sitting there for a good 8-10 minutes before someone told me to go ahead with my order and then interrupted me two seconds later so that I could \"hold on\" for even longer. Of course the food was wrong and my chicken tenders were dry. Lastly, I could hear the same girl who took my order complain to her coworker about me sending my order back. A remodel of your establishment doesn't do much when your customers are still unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Went for early lunch 11:00 and everything was fine , staff very nice , don't know what everyone s problem is"}
{"text":"Previous review: training facility, I guess that says it all.  I tried to stop in last night for a quick bite but after waiting about eight minutes to get to the order box no one took my order.  I got a \"be with you in a moment\" twice before I just drove off."}
{"text":"I've seen a lot of bad reviews on this place, but I had zero issues when we went. We went at 9:00pm on a Thursday, so that may be why. We went to the restaurant because the drive thru line was fairly big. Both ordered fries and baconaters. The food was fresh and delicious and the restaurant seemed pretty clean to me! We would definitely return."}
{"text":"THE WORST HAMBURGERRR that I have ever eaten. Horrible. The worst. I have not eaten at Wendy's for many years. The Burgers were fresh and tasty. What happened? It didn't even taste like meat. Yuck..."}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food place in the whole world.     In drive through line 28 minutes all for a COLD Dave's single.  Grossly understaffed.   Could be a great option for fast food but awful service and cold food.  Get a decent manager in here. Take a lesson on service and how  to prepare food  from Chick Filet A. Too bad I can't give it no stars."}
{"text":"A confusing and frustrating place.  Our wait (in the drive thru) was about 40 minutes. I wish I was making that up but I'm not. We'd just returned to Charlotte from a day trip to Kings Mountain and didn't have time to make dinner so we decided to stop here, it was a decision we quickly regretted. Aside from the slow service and botched order (as a lactose intolerant person who specifically asks for food without cheese, and then notes \"please, no cheese\", it's always great to open the wrapper and see the thing just oozing with cheese) the most memorable experience of this excursion was when a child got out of the SUV two cars in front of us because his mother told him to get out and \"stretch his legs\", they'd been waiting so long that the child needed to *stretch his legs*.  On top of the slow service and botched order, they didn't include a receipt with the meal (the cynic in me says this was to dissuade people from contacting management -- though the lack of speed at this location seems to be an on going issue).  It's all very confusing because this place is in such a great location that it could demand Chick-Fil-A levels of business yet there seems to be no interest in upping their game. It's weird."}
{"text":"We needed to feed the family and feed it fast!  Wendy's did the job.  Some of their best menu items aren't burgers.  If we come through again, we'll go back."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and recieved great service fast, accurate and had a sense of humor. Thank you for your hardwork."}
{"text":"I just love Wendy's the four for four is the best deal ever #BLT with ranch instead of mayo oh yeah."}
{"text":"I think the only reason this place is still in business is because it's right outside of Carowinds.  When you are competing with $15 hamburgers, it doesn't matter if your dining room isn't clean, the food isn't fresh, the lines take 20 to 30 minutes, the cashiers are easily confused and seem to get 70% of the orders wrong. It wasn't much less expensive.  My stale burger was $7.00. Try Culvers, across the street. Less expensive than Carowinds and much better that Carowinds or Wendys."}
{"text":"They don't seem to get their orders right.  Husband ordered a Baconator or (something like that - beef and bacon on a bun) and he took his order to go.  The girl taking his order was borderline rude... or at least didn't have basic manners.  If someone says \"thank you\" it's customary to respond with \"you're welcome.\"    When he got back to the hotel he opened it, and found that instead of a bacon burger he had a spicy chicken sandwich.  He doesn't eat spicy things.  And because there was an event at the convention center, he didn't want to go out again and lose his parking spot. What's weird, is that this place wasn't busy.  There was one guy ahead of him, and some people sitting at a table.  How do you mess this up when you're not even busy?   Bottom line, check to make sure you've got YOUR order - and if you can, stand at the counter and watch the kitchen like a hawk so you know for sure."}
{"text":"Huge fan for the 4 for $4 deal; however this location always seems like utter chaos inside. The drive in is slow and generally they make errors with the food order. It is really a throw of the dice if your order will be correct or not. Personally, I feel as though high turn over is the cause. Please be sure to check you order other than that they have always been polite."}
{"text":"Check your order, they will mess it up or forget stuff. Friendly staff inside not in drive thru. Food is hot and fresh. Drive thur does move fast it seems."}
{"text":"So happy to receive hot, fresh food the way I ordered it! Everything was made to order and was delicious! Service was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful. My daughter accidentally dropped her burger so I went yo to order a new one and they replaced it for free. Great service, great food, great family time!"}
{"text":"I love Wendy's - especially their junior bacon cheeseburgers. I usually eat one for a snack but catch me hungry and I'll down three of those bad boys. A Wendy's Frosty for dessert is a big hit with the kids. This location is an exception. I have been twice where the food quality was low. On my recent visit, three of the junior burgers were pink on the inside - ahhhh perfect now I get to think for a couple days of how I may have fed two kids Jack in the Box burgers.   I must say that the staff was professional at dealing with me raising my voice when I explained that they could have killed a kid or left them chronically ill. They did seem genuinely concerned and aware of the dangers of feeding kids raw mass produced groud beef.   How do you make a half centimeter thick kid burger pink in the middle anyway? Bounce it off the grill twice?   Go to one of the locations south of here instead. Queensway near Ikea is one of the new stores - much nicer."}
{"text":"Being better than the Twinsburg location doesn't earn you a 4 star review, nor does being a Wendy's. This place had it together when I rolled through yesterday. Fine product, efficient service, and fast. What else are you looking for in a Wendy. Wendy, she left me alone. Approved."}
{"text":"Poor experience. Very slow and cold fries were exchanged for over cooked fries. At least they were hot. Plan for extra time. Spicy chicken sandwich was very good."}
{"text":"The drive thru service is abysmal. I asked for a number 8 spicy and they came back \"that was a medium number 6?\" When I corrected her, she gave attitude. Don't try to ask for additional condiments, you might be lucky to get two packets of ketchup for a large French fry. If I was stranded on Eastway, in need of food and this was the only option, I'd be okay with starving."}
{"text":"Eh. The best of the worst. Stopped here when I was travelling as it was convenient   Customer service was ok  Food came out hot and good   Building is dated, not a bother though cleanliness could certainly be improved  All in all, good enough"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes. Only to be told we can't take your order because we don't have a cashier here. Then... When she arrives... We are out of the only thing you wanted."}
{"text":"15 min to get our order (2 people) and once we did get it is was wrong.  I asked if they knew how long we wait and she said 12 min and i said my clock say 15 but either way that's a long time for an incorrect order.  Nobody cares.  Annoying."}
{"text":"After not having Wendy's for awhile we figured we'd give it a go. Staff was polite and friendly. Food was not very good unfortunately. Chili seemed off, chicken sandwiches were ok but not great. Fries were soggy and limp. It will probably be another three years before we give Wendy's another try. Just seems like the whole facility could use a drastic makeover. Two stars for the polite staff-minus three stars for the food itself."}
{"text":"The only reason I go to this particular Wendy's is because it is close to my home. Either the order is wrong or the food is bad. I ordered two Frosties, thinking they were .50 as advertised. Nope, they charged me full price. They operate their restaurant the way they want, even if Wendy's is advertising specials nationally for ALL Wendy's, This Wendy's does not offer all items on the menu. I never get an apology from Management for poor service. They don't care about the customers."}
{"text":"Quick service, great cashier. Food was really fresh. I don't think I've had fries so crispy in years! This is the cleanest Wendy's around!!"}
{"text":"I go here on occasion with my kids. customer service is always good as is the food. Will always go back as long as we live in scottsdale"}
{"text":"My last visit to this Wendy's was the second time that my fries and chicken nuggets were cold. Yes, cold not warm. It is always a gamble if of you will get good service here.   The first time I was given a refund. The second time I was in too much of a rush to go back and complain.   When I pulled in the drive thru there were three cars ahead of me and the restaurant seemed backed up. You would think that if it was that backed up the food would be fresh.  I feel that this will be my last time patronizing this Wendy's no matter how desperate I am. Also the employee at the second window barely acknowledged my presence and only stuck her hand out of the window and nothing else.  I think that it is no coincidence that I continue to have bad experiences at this location."}
{"text":"A very bad experience. The people that cook there are not professional and the meat did not taste real. This is my third attempt to try them out and every time they get my order wrong."}
{"text":"Do not eat here ... food consistently sucks every time Salad was old - lettuce chewy  Cheeseburgers were a sloppy mess unable to eat and fries were disgusting  Doesn't even deserve 1 star at this place....I'm only giving a 1 because they are consistently serving terrible food .....sad to be consistently bad What does it say for the managers and district managers ? Close this health trap down!"}
{"text":"Wendy's is the place to go when you want a meaty burger. The baconator really makes me happy. This Wendy's is newly renovated,(within the last 2 months) and is really nice and clean!"}
{"text":"The girl taking the order in the drive-thru is very rude. She kept interrupting me when I was trying to give my order and when I drove up to the window she spoke to me like I was an idiot. I even felt her spit on my arm when she was talking... It was disgusting!"}
{"text":"Manager Matt handled my drive thru experience incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional. He was rude while I ordered and once approaching the window I was not greeted. He then decided to take his frustration out on my debit card which he was not able to scan a couple of times and forgot a couple of items from my order. It was rush hour so I understand you need to move faster than usual but if you cannot properly handle yourself during stress full situations at the drive thru I don't get how he has the capability to be a manager.   All he has to do is greet me, process my order, check to see all is in the bag and give me my order. He failed and I am truly upset they on my road trip I cannot return to get the items he shorted me.   Thank You."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is an okay location.  It isn't the best or the worst, just average.  Let me tell you why, if you really want to know...  1.  The food here is usually good.  The burgers are always great.  I heart the Baconator.  I mean it is burger, bacon, and cheese without anything to distract from meat and cheese heaven.  YUM.  I know it is probably the worst thing on the menu but I LOVE it anyways.  When the craving hits, off to Wendy's I go.  The other sandwiches are always good too.  And the chicken nuggets are always great snacks.  Where this Wendy's gets a lower rating is due to the fries and the Frostys (or is it Frosties????).  Both are always a crapshoot.  Sometimes the fries are fresh, hot and amazing and some times they taste so blah.  The Frostys are usually good, but every now and then they taste like they forgot to add sugar or something.  If these 2 items could be more consistent, my score would go up for sure.  2.  The staff.  Sometimes you get the best people helping you, which is always so very nice.  And then there are the other ones.  One lady who works here, usually the drive thru is simply UGH.  She barks at you to order, doesn't give you a minute to look if you ask for one, and practically throws your food at you when you get up to the window.  You are almost afraid to ask for some ketchup from her.    Overall, I think 75% of the staff is really friendly, but if you go on the wrong day and get the other 25%, then I am sorry for you.  So most of the time, this location is good.  My advice to you is to always check your fries and Frostys before you leave to make sure you got good ones!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't call myself a Wendy's aficianado per se, however I'm very experienced in the Wendy's way of life. This has to be the worst location I've ever been to in my life. The cashier looked high and couldn't understand who ordered what. When he asked what drink I wanted I replied \"Barq's\", which I was met with a  \"uh.... what's that?\". Whats worse is my friend ordered right after me also asking for barq's, he needed a good while to figure out what that was. Come on man, you only have six options. When we recieved our food the chicken nuggets were stale, junior cheese burgers tasted auful and the frostys were soup. Another customer here asked for his money back on his frosty soup, as did we. The manager told us the machine has had issues all day, yet still sells people the frosty soup. He did however give us a card for a free frosty next visit. All in all, Wendy's is great, this one is not."}
{"text":"Not one but TWO times had to drive back around and give them back the food they handed me. Two times they gave me someone else's food! Every time I tried to check, they told me they were busy and that I needed to pull forward if I wanted to check.   I just wanted to try their salad.   Every fast food restaurant has the ability to make a decision: are you going to be as bad as everyone expects, or are you going to take the time to do it right?  Wendy's of 301 E Indian School, I hope you read this. Moreover, I hope you try harder to take the time to do it right. I believe in you."}
{"text":"Wendy's is one of my FAVE fast-food places.  Why is this? Well, this is my reasoning:  1. Fries are to DIE for. Their seasoning is on-point as well as they don't overcook them as well as are \"mealy\" without being overwhelming.  2. Burgers are of substance and generous w/fixings.  3. Frosties. Well, they're just awesome and have been on the menu for decades.  4. Salads don't just consist of some lame Iceberg lettuce and a couple of tomatoes thrown on for color. They make them w/romaine and spinach. :)  Yes, they are spendier than MickyD's but you're paying for quality and consistency."}
{"text":"I ordered a Double Stack and Small Frosty, it was cooked thoroughly and The Frosty was chillin' like a villain!  Customer service was quick and accurate!"}
{"text":"I ordered the #6 which is the Spicy Chicken Combo. Made to order with no problems. I opted for the All Natural Lemonade which is out of this world. I went to get a refill when I was told no refills on that drink. Considering I spent $2.59 for one drink and no refills is just flat out ridiculous. I've been to the location at Sunset and Marks where they never said anything about no refills. I am not a happy camper..."}
{"text":"It's a good Wendy's but not a good neighborhood! They do get the food order right, though the receipt is usually not included.  Be VERY careful at this Wendy's and be especially aware of your surroundings. I have heard about at least one robbery and two car break-ins. Keep your wits about you as you're waiting in the drive-thru.  I go, but only because it is very close to my home and it is convenient."}
{"text":"Super busy location, right next to the Target. It's a drive-through which I always find very helpful.  Standard Wendy's menu. I really like the value menu items because i find them to be an excellent, uh, value. Low cost, good eats. The \"junior deluxe cheeseburger\" has an actual piece of lettuce (not shredded) and a proper slice of tomato on there. By default, also mustard which I think doesn't belong on a burger.  Very organized, quick service. Top notch for a Wendy's."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was a change in management, a change is support staff or a change in both but this Wendy's location has stepped up their game a bit.  Against my better judgement I went to Wendy's last week to give it another chance after months of a boycott.  I was impressed.  The food came out very quick and my order was accurate.  A spicy chicken sandwich.  I know, it is hard to mess up an order that simple.  So I decided to try again today.  Same situation.  Fast food and an accurate order received.  For that I am giving them a bump up to 3 stars from my previous rating of 2.  Today I ordered a Ceasar side salad, a four piece chicken nugget, and a spicy chicken go-wrap.  My complaint is that one of my four nuggets was about half the size of the other three but that is just the way it was processed.  3 stars seems fair right now for the change in customer service.  Change for the better is progress.   I still have a problem with Wendy's on a corporate level.  They have alienated their customer base with cost cutting measures.  They have raised prices and given less food all to make a buck.  The side salad from Wendy's is not a big salad.  It is a side.  Yet the dressing packet was not big enough to even cover the side salad.  I would have asked for extra dressing had I ordered a larger salad.  There are a few items left on the menu I still like so I will probably be back.  Though I will not visit as frequently as I used to."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong when you need something quick to eat from Wendy's.  I'm definitely a fan of their value menu!  I like their crispy chicken sandwich.  Their salads are wonderful too.  During the cooler months, I always go for their chili.  When I can't think of where to go and need to grab something fast...Wendy's is staple!  My husband loves this place too!  Especially their burgers and frosty's."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a salad from Wendy's!  I also love their Value Meal Chicken sandwiches.  I really like their \"pick 2\" menu....allows for a healthy salad and a little treat like fries or a shake on the side!   When I want to grab something quick...Wendy's is always at the top of my list of considerations!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever. I went one night and they wouldn't give me the 50 nuggets for $10 deal. Fine. So I order two of the 4 for $4 combos. I paid and she asked me to pull forward because they were waiting on the burgers. Strange but ok. I pulled forward and waited. And waited. And waited. SIX cars came through after me and left with food. Finally, after 27 minutes of waiting, I drove back around and asked for my money back. I was so angry! The girl said they were just about to run it out to me. Wtf?! I said I wanted my money back and so she gave it to me. I saw the food sitting there so I told her she should give me the food too. She did but I had to ask for it. You would think they would offer my money back, give me the free food and coupons for more free food! 27 minutes!! I will never go to the location again. They are awful!"}
{"text":"Food still good, until I used the NASTY mens room.. Barf. Cmon, I should have checked the restroom the first time I was here. Disgusting."}
{"text":"This location is located in the classy around the area of the Camelback Colonnade area. With many fast food options and restaurants in the area this Wendy's location has seemed to do very well. The interior is updated and the location is always clean. The service is fast, friendly and a great bang for the buck. I think Wendy's has probably one of the best breakfast as far as options and quality food. The only issue I have with this location is my orders are not always up to par. My food thru the drive thru only has been served cold or prepared wrong. Meaning if I ask for no sauce they will still add the sauce. It happens all the time. Other then that everything else is all good."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Wendy's food. I like their chili and their baked potatoes. Of course I'll get their spicy chicken sandwich too on occasion.  This location is conveniently located near east towne mall. The drive thru has always been decent.   This last time I went I ordered chili for my partner and myself. They didn't give us crackers--had to ask for some after we got our order. I also felt bad for the customers who ordered after us. The cashier was working on her hair/rearranging it as the register and asked for us to wait. Then she handed them their drink cups and her fingers were inside the cup.   There was also a spider crawling down from the ceiling behind the register.   It wasn't that great of a visit but the chili was great as always. 2 stars for \"service\" and 3-4 stars for food."}
{"text":"As usual when reviewing a large well known chain, I am reviewing the location and not the chain or its general offerings:  This store was recently remodeled.  Service is very friendly and efficient but what I really like is the spiffy new soft drink dispenser that offers one a much larger drink selection than the old variety, particularly a lot more diet options.  Would like to see other fast food places adopt this."}
{"text":"A couple coworkers and I frequent this Wendy's when we are looking for a cheaper, faster lunch. Honestly we've never had a bad experience here. Yah, of course foods not going to be consistent, but it's fast food. What do you really expect? It's also cleaner than a lot of joints I've been to. The food always comes out pretty quick.   I get the usual, which is the spicy chicken sandwich. Sometimes I go with the fries, sometimes a baked potato. Definitely hit and miss."}
{"text":"Still terrible despite their remodel. Exceptionally slow service despite it seems they are over staffed. Perhaps it's because they're all clowning around with each other, and then when they have to do work, they are so rude. Multiple yikes have gotten the wrong food upon returning home from the drive thru. I love Wendy's, I would rather drive 20 miles to the next one than ever patronize this one again. GET IT TOGETHER."}
{"text":"If I order a son of baconator it would be nice to get more than just bread patties and bacon. No condiments really? Also no cheese???  As a previous reviewer said if you hate your job don't do it to go find something else. Ripping me off means that myself nor my family will ever visit this particular Wendy's ever again. And I'm definitely not going to do another 30 minute round-trip so you can make it right make it right the first time."}
{"text":"This Wendy's has been recently remodeled and looks great!    I always rock the value menu!  I can get nuggets, fries, chicken sandwich and a frosty for under $5!  Dipping the fries in the frosty is nothing new, but dip those nuggets in the frosty and it will change your life!  I have been coming to this particular Wendy's since 2006 because it's close to my office.  The drive thru is consistently fast and accurate.  While the food quality isn't the best I've had from Wendy's it isn't bad at all.  It might be one of the better Wendy's restaurants in LV but the ones in the mid west are always better."}
{"text":"Lady taking order was nice and friendly and food was hot and fast. But the inside of this Wendys is awful and needs remodeled, they need to change franchise owners or something. I got a refill before I left and the lady who did spilled the drink all over the side and didn't say sorry or offer to wipe it off. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"They were fast and did a good job getting order changes right. You get the food you'd expect from a Wendy's which is exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"Nice employees but very slow moving. 8 workers and yet it took 30 minutes for food with one person in front of me in my line. Food was cold. Place was dirty with lots of random puddles on the floor. Ceiling was dry so I'm not sure where water was coming from."}
{"text":"Though this Wendy's has a dreary exterior, I was surprised by the updated interior. The carpet was newer and surprisingly clean (not including a table with several fries littered on the floor around it). My food was your typical Wendy's fare, which was exactly what I needed/wanted at the time. I was disappointed that the location did not have one of the new Coca-Cola Freestyle machines, especially since it appeared to have been recently updated."}
{"text":"this place is trash.  I waited 10 mins for my order and it was wrong.   I tried to eat what they gave me but it was stale.  Threw it out."}
{"text":"Positive: fast and accurate service. Close to my office.   Negative: Nothing ever tastes right. The fries are limp and the frosties have an odd taste and texture. The chili is served the wrong side of warm."}
{"text":"If I owned this location, I would fire everyone and start from scratch. There are two customers in the building and every table it's dirty. The staff lack social skills. Ihonestly forgot that I don't like this location, or I would have gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Burger was good.  Fries were good. Soda was good. FROSTY was AMAZING.  for a cheeseburger combo it is $5.95. To upgrade to large it's a dollar.  Frosty's are $3 for a small.  They don't charge you extra for BBQ sauce.  This place saved my stomach (strangely enough) I was hungover and the burger and fries literally kept me from dry heaving. Thank you wendy's."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I have ever been too. In line at drive thru with 4 cars ahead and took 20 minutes to get food, then they screwed up the order. This is the norm every time I go there. They just renovated the place, so was hoping service would improve, it has not..."}
{"text":"Chicken Nuggets: Stale  French Fries: Stale  Chili: Missing the cheese, which I paid extra for and super watery.  New Grilled Chicken Sandwich: Extremely dry and tasteless.  JBC: Fair  I get that I drove thru around midnight but still. The food was BAD. Burger King will make fresh food for you at that hour. Two stars because their clerks were super nice but the food deserves zero stars.  Late-night bummer."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken sandwich I had today was so salty, it ruined my \"healthy\" meal. Ridiculous! I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the most sloppy Wendy's in all of Las Vegas. Aside from the unclean environment, and poorly put together burgers, I waited inside 20 minutes for my \"fast\" food"}
{"text":"Dave Thomas would turn over in his grave!  Dirty everywhere, from the kitchen to the dining area to the restrooms!  The person behind the counter when I visited yesterday, August 21, 2016, just did not want to be there, and certainly did not want to be bothered with a customer.  The burger was not hot and juicy, but cold and dry, with unrequested mustard on it.  Oh, and did I mention that there were no napkins in the restaurant, either behind the counter or in the dining room!  I knew both Dave Thomas and Jim Near, and I ate in the first Wendy's in Columbus, Ohio.  I find this a sad time for Wendy's.  It's good that Dave and Jim are not around to see what happened to the business they dedicated their lives to.  It would be a miracle if the Wendy's board could find a CEO who is capable of turning this around.  I think it is too late!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is okay. Customer service was good and the large dining area was clean. I was confused by the 'employees only' door because there is an open space next to the counter that can let anyone just walk behind it. I see that as a safety issue and that needs to be fixed right away. Another thing that bothered me is that there are two entry ways on each side of the building, but the one entry has you stepping into the path of the cars that are leaving the drive through. I don't know who designed this building but it's another safety issue and just wasn't a good idea. Other than that I was pleased with everything else and I was happy to get my SPICY chicken nuggets."}
{"text":"The worst Wendy's in existence. Don't go here, the employees are so lazy and slow. They won't serve you because you come after midnight."}
{"text":"Bozos. Serve the menu. That's all. Just serve what's listed on the menu.   Went there 8/16/2017, 12:30 am, craving chili. Ok, not the greatest chili but add red peppers, worschestshire sauce (sp?) and Chipolte flavored Tabasco, it's ok. But at this time and date, THEY DONT HAVE ANY CHILI!  !!!   !!!!!  Chili is an item that never needs to be shorted, should always be ready. And whatever is left over at the end of the day is merely refrigerated and reheated the following day. There is never any waste there is never any reason to run out.   Manager quickly responded to my complaint with no apology no reasons, no \"won't happen again\".   As I said, bozos.  All bozos."}
{"text":"They gave me a stone hard \"grilled\" asiago burger. It looks/taste like it's been sitting there for a while and they just heat it up that's why it just made the asiago chicken patty hard and dry. I asked for a fresh one, like it's stated/promised to be. They took it back but didn't even say sorry for the inconvinience or anything. But i got a fresher one in like 8-10 mins."}
{"text":"Walked in and the girl cleaning the machine by the counter had the nastiest look on her face. Didn't acknowledge anyone who can in. But did have the time to argue with one of her coworkers in the back.  The young man who took my order was very nice and it wasn't his fault that they basically ran out of everything. This location needs work from knowing how to order to make sure their inventory is not depleted to customer service classes for some of the employees. Something is always off.  We will find another location to go to from now on."}
{"text":"Also filed a complaint with wendy's.com  Here we are again today. Ordered my food from the drive through and 2 items were missing. Ordered regular food and once again have to pull up and wait for an order that is not complete. When is Wendy's going to review this store and fire the management.  8/9/2012 Previous ReviewEvery time I seem to go to this location they screw something up. I ordered a BLT cobb salad a while back and they said they had to cook then chicken and it would be a few. 10 minutes later it came out and was only half the chicken that was in the full salad.  This week I went and ordered the same thing and they charged me for the cobb salad and gave me a salad with out chicken and missing bacon, egg and blue cheese. They don't even make the salad they gave me. So I could understand if they just gave me the wrong salad but this place needs new management. Fries taste like they have been soaking in oil too long and over cooked."}
{"text":"We were headed home and looking for a simple burger. Wendy's burgers have a great flavor, and their 'priced right' menu is very affordable.   We arrived, and stood behind a family of 3 who was placing their order. While we were waiting, we realized that the employee behind the counter was slow. I mean...SLOOOOW. The employee also messed up one of the drinks, giving the man a regular coke when he asked for diet. Their order was very small, and it took nearly 5 minutes to complete so they could sit down. I almost left, but we were already there.   As we stepped up to the counter, thinking that it was finally our turn, the employee was gone. Turns out that he was below the register and came up with a handful of cash. I just figured that he was restocking the register. When he was done, he just looked at us and asked in the most quiet voice ever how he could help us. He looked happy enough, but he was the quietest most slow moving person I had seen in a while.   We stood to the side and waited for our order. A young man came in and complained that he had placed an order in drive-thru, and didn't receive two of his sandwiches. Again, the employee disappeared under the counter. For real? Stood up with another handful of cash. It was weird, but I have no idea how they handle their register so maybe this was normal. Meanwhile, another employee brought food out to two different vehicles waiting off to the side of the drive-thru for their food. Understaffed maybe? Slow employees? From what I could tell...yes to both.   Our order was a doublestack, jr. cheeseburger, fries and a drink. My jr. cheeseburger was just ok. The bun was cold, but soft. Cheese was not even melted a tiny bit. The meat was warm but not super hot. There was such a tiny amount of ketchup and mustard on my burger that they may as well have not even bothered. My husband said that his doublestack was pretty good. The fries were surprisingly tasty. I was not impressed at all. I left disappointed."}
{"text":"On my way to work I stopped here to get a garden salad for lunch. General Wendy's the best, however not this time. As I proceeded to enjoy my salad, I'm picking through it bc I hate when you get those big chuck of lettuce stalk and as I go to remove a piece, I found a smashed black bug on a part of the lettuce. So if the food was exposed or salad mix wasn't washed properly if at all."}
{"text":"Oh my God! This place is horrible! The line through the driveway goes all the way around the building if you go inside thinking it's going to be faster you'll be out of luck. The people behind the counter act as if they don't know what they're doing moving slow as heck giggling and laughing and just looking like lost squirrels. I left and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! NEVER GO THERE!! My family had dinner one night and the idiots lost our order. Yet they didn't lose anyone else's. Probably because we were the only light colored skin looking people in there!! They didn't even apologize and forget about getting a refund!! Not worth wasting time and money there!!"}
{"text":"It's a bunch of kids in there running it at night took Forever to get it when I asked not to be charged for a tea I was shoved a bag of food in my face as the cashier said \"here\" didn't make me pay but I don't trust it pretty sure they did something suspicious with my food threw it right out"}
{"text":"Do not come to this location if u r in a hurry or during lunch time on the week days. We stopped in around 12:15 and it took them almost 20 mins for our food and by then this place was packed. Make sure u get everything u ordered they forgot our drinks and they forgot I said dine in, they put our food in bags. It seems like the girl in front was training and she was all alone everyone else was working drive thru and the back. I will not be back at this location ever again."}
{"text":"So Wendy's has been one of my favorite fast food chains. I always felt their food was freshest and less disgusting. But then I heard about their meat coming from horses. I'm not sure if I'll be back. Note to wendys, if this is not true, message me!"}
{"text":"I can usually eat Wendy's, but this location's chicken sandwiches are very dry and the fries were cold. Wasn't to impressed. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Didn't get all of the items I ordered AND PAID FOR! What's worse is, I wasn't given a receipt so I can't even prove they forgot to give me something! When I called corporate to tell them of this, they said I could just go back and since I had some food in hand that I should get what was missing... with no receipt (I don't think so) she decided to give me the store number instead so I can inform the manager before driving there. So they gave me the number and all it is is BUSY, the few times you can get through it's a dial-up set of tones that are ear piercing! We also didn't get straws, or utensils for our food. Though, there wasn't hardly any wait at all so I must have been lucky there, but not lucky enough for good service!"}
{"text":"They made us wait for over five minutes just to order. They said that they were busy changing the pop machine. They gave us the incorrect change. We called and the manager was the rude person who gave us the wrong change. She said that she told us we needed to wait and that we gave her the incorrect change. Nothing was resolved. Don't plan on heading there anytime soon. I guess we do need iHob."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money at this place! I have tried it several times hoping it would get better and it just got worse. They would never get my order right and their customer service is horrible! The last time I went there was through the drive through, I was buying food for my four kids plus my two nefews. They messed up my order (shocker!) plus it wasn't even complete. Only four of the six kids ate and I had to drive back to wendys for the rest of my order(and I live 5 miles away from wendys) I was so angry I called their corporate offices, they didn't care either."}
{"text":"Wendys is one of my favorites! Always fresh and always delicious. They have a great variety of hearty and also healthy choices.  I'm at this location all the time and it's rare that I don't get excellent service. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. All of their sandwiches are really good, but the crispy chicken is amazing! If you're looking for something sweet, try the vanilla frosty always good on a hot day."}
{"text":"Best Wendy's on this side of town. This place is managed really well. This area gets pretty busy during lunch, but this location gets people in and out really fast. Never had any problems here."}
{"text":"Worst fries ever! I think they cooked them in soap! Also they didn't get my order correct! Soggy burger! Ended up going to In-N-Out just down the street! Don't come here unless you like Fear Factor!"}
{"text":"My friend ordered chicken nuggets, and two of them were molded together. I'm vegetarian, so I sat there with my crappy fries but tasty frosty and watched the madness unfold.  As she tore the two melded nuggets away from each other, THERE WAS A GELLY WHITE PASTE THAT DRIPPED OUT. I am literally gagging just recalling the incident, and I almost threw up all over the table.  This exact same scenario happened to my sister, on her totally different box of chicken nuggets 45 second later. Nobody finished our food. We all just left.  There is white gooey crap IN THE FOOD at wendys.   So incredibly gross. SO gross. Gross. Don't go here, for the love of god!!"}
{"text":"This is actually for terminal 3 Wendy's as it was not on Yelp. The service was excellent because one of the cashiers forgot to order one of my sandwiches and the manager jumped to action and got me one and said no charge, I was willing to pay but she said no and gave to me!! Great customer service in a land where there is none.. Like the Starbucks next to it where they all were rude not only to me but other customers too. Better fix Starbucks"}
{"text":"One word: Terrible.   Where are the robots? The staff here are slow, inefficient, and there seems to be a lack of management. They look like chickens with their heads cut off.   There are more employees in this establishment than customers, and yet there's a line of people \"waiting to order\". There was people waiting to give their order while a crowd of people were waiting to receive their order. With at least a dozen employees I could count from the counter, they could not prepare the food fast enough.  As for the food, the burger should have been warmer, most likely it was sitting out for a while, and fries were not freshly cooked. Below Average quality for Wendy's.    Not a recommendation."}
{"text":"It had been years since I'd had a Frosty, and on my way back from a movie at the Palace in Sun Prairie I was hit with a spur of the moment craving and stopped mid-sentence to ask my boyfriend to pull in.   It was about five minutes before 10 PM and the parking lot was empty, the lights were dim, and it was unclear if they were closing or not. We spent a minute debating then decided to just pull through to the drive-thru and see what happened. Someone came on the squawk box and took our order right away and when we pulled to the window I was glad to see the drive-thru was open until one.  Service: fine. Frosty: as expected, though maybe a little less chocolatey than I remembered (and I don't remember it being all that chocolatey in the first place).   Some indication that the drive-thru is open when the dining room is dimmed would be helpful - we took a chance since it was still (barely) before 10, but if it had been 11 I'd assume I was out of luck."}
{"text":"It's fast food. It's simple orders. And they still manage to get it wrong. I have low blood sugar and I'm allergic to pickles, weird, right? I sometimes need a quick small meal to keep me from have a medical issue but sure enough, after I say no pickles, there they are, on the sandwich. This has happened more than a few times. I like Wendy's food and Twitter account but this specific store is awful."}
{"text":"This location must have changed franchise owners recently. My family has eaten here about 3 times in the past two months and every time they have screwed up the order. They were not very friendly about changing it either. Just this last time they had a kid on the register who you could tell was very new, he kept trying to give us combos even though we didn't want them. Best to avoid this place for a while."}
{"text":"What the hell did someone dump the whole salt shaker on my burger? Never again poor R David must be rolling in his grave..."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer. I always get the 4 for 4 with BACONATOR fries, never has been a problem.  .... well today I asked to get BACONATOR fries & the order taker said YES - but then a RUDE lady yelled NO! [WHICH IS IT? YES OR NO?]  I let them know that I do it all the time without a problem for $1 up charge that I don't mind paying.   He still said no.. [Due to the rude manager yelling no at him & me]    So I said ok if you're not going to change it, I don't want anything!   Here comes the RUDE lady again & she said \"BYE!\"   What type of customer service is this?!   Instead of turning away a customer, aren't you supposed to make the customer satisfied? Guess not!   Worst customer service ever! I will not come back & I will tell everyone not to come to this location.   Instead of making money, you turned a customer away, great job! Now I'll go elsewhere.   As for the order taker, he didn't do a thing wrong. It was the rude & loud lady manager speaking over him.   Shouldn't there be only 1 voice over the speaker? Wow. Never again.  DONT COME HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is consistently terrible. Typically, I simply don't return if the service/food is bad. However, I like Wendy's and this one is very close to my house.  So I have continued going despite the fact that they get my order wrong every...single...time.    My orders are always very simple.  Usually, I get either a salad or the $4 deal.  Every time I get the meal deal, I order spicy nuggets.  I actually receive spicy nuggets about 25% of the time. I often order the apple pecan chicken salad, and they almost always forget to give me the pecans. Today, I ordered a full size taco salad. I received only one sour cream, which is common, and my small cup of chili was LESS than half full.  Second time Ive had that happen.  It was like they scraped the bottom of the pot, didn't have enough, and didn't care.  Keep in mind that these are the most consistent issues.  There are plenty more examples.  Missing food, sandwiches prepared wrong, missing straws/condiments/utensils.  The list goes on.  It is evident that these people have no investment in customer satisfaction.  I just want to be able to go the restaurant I like and get what I pay for.  This particular store seems incapable of delivering.  I'm throwing in the towel.  I'll drive a few extra miles if they'll get my order right."}
{"text":"This is the only Wendy's I have close by, so that's the only reason why I continue to go here. It seems like every other time I'm here the person working the driver thru window is EXTREMELY rude and that customers are an inconvenience. Tonight the person mumbled and when we asked what was said they proceeded to get an attitude. This is your job, and I understand you may not like it, but I gave you no reason to be rude."}
{"text":"Went to this Wendy's over the weekend and I legit thought I was being filmed on a reality prank show or something. I parked to go inside because I thought something was wrong with the drive thru. Went in and nobody was at the registers. Had three people just stare at me. Then when they made my food the one girl tossed my burger at a guy and it fell on the floor. It took me 26 minutes from the time I pulled the parking lot, waited at the drive thru and then waited inside, just for 2 jbc and a chicken wrap. I only use this app to give 5 star ratings, and put over places I like. But this place was just such trash. I didn't say anything there because I didn't want to cause a scene or have my food spit in. The only positive was a good story to tell others about how crazy bad the experience was."}
{"text":"Disgusting. With the rudest staff. Avoid this location at all costs. Its almost as though they dont care about the food"}
{"text":"I will drive the extra distance to go to chik fil a now. This location has THE most rude employees i have ever come in contact with. The fries tasted like they were from yesterday. When we asked for more sauce he handed it to us and slammed the window. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"Alot better than I remember back in the day. The bacon was crispy. The Asiago sandwich is pretty good for fast food. They mix it up so nice change once in awhile folks."}
{"text":"A late night snack attack got the better of me and I wish it hadn't. Not because I felt like a shitty, horrible person for downing a thousand calories at night, I hadn't really eaten all day, but because \"The Baconator\", a so called premium sandwich, was blandanator. No flavor at all! My drink had flavor, however, just not the right flavor... I ordered a Sprite and what I got tasted like a mixture of Mountain Dew and a shitty explosion of limes.   The finale was being given drinks and no straws, as well as never being asked if I wanted any sauce to go with the chicken nuggets I ordered.   Note to self,  When you drive up and employees are screaming and acting a fool inside, keep on driving."}
{"text":"Came here at 1am. Got a baconator meal and a chicken sandwich meal. The fries were cold and had clearly been sitting out forever. The burger and chicken sandwich were okay. I get that it's fast food but at least make an attempt to serve decent food."}
{"text":"Its a wendy's. The food is the same as everywhere else but this location is showing its age. Its old and kind of grungy. Needs to be remodelled but its not like your taking a date there so do you care??"}
{"text":"Don't go here. I stopped in for dinner the other night and it was horrible. Service was lousy and the place was a mess.   I asked what a Baja salad was, and the girl said it had \"lettuce, some green stuff (she meant guacamole), chips (crispy tortilla strips according to the sign), and some other stuff.\" I ordered the salad and a side of chili, but when my order came out it was just a salad with lettuce, some cheese, and chili poured all over it. I asked the girl what it was and she said it was my order. I asked why there was chili on it, and she said that's how it's made. Disgusted, I asked where my side of chili was, and she said that they put it on the salad. Ummm... ok.... Seeing my dismay, she asked if I wanted a different salad, so I ordered the Cobb salad. It took almost a half hour for them to prepare it at fast food restaurant that was dead. Ughhh."}
{"text":"Apparently the employees were to lazy to heat up my baconator fries to melt the cheese."}
{"text":"This Wendy's always gets the food right... However their service is one of the worst. Their employees do not greet you and do not tell you to have a nice day or thank you. My suggestion is to hire somebody who is outgoing and enthusiastic to run the window or the cash register. It's actually offensive how rude they are."}
{"text":"The only reason why this place gets a star is because it is a \"Wendys\". I visited this Wendy's 12 weeks ago & found mold on the bun of my grilled chicken sandwiches. I will never eat at this Wendy's again. I rather eat at the McDonalds right next to it (or the Subway across)."}
{"text":"Sucks. They don't care about the quality. The new fish was I sliver PD lettuce, a small wipe of sauce, a dry bun with over fried in old grease. Very disappointed not going back. Keep driving."}
{"text":"Great location. The building is one of the nicer that I have seen. However, they often don't honor promos and take a lot of time to get the food to you."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by all the negative reviews! Ate in and had excellent, accurate service. I enjoy getting the baconator without a bun and they served it in a tray....it was delicious!!! This will be my go-to for lunch whenever I go to the outlets."}
{"text":"I've never eaten inside this location, just used the drive-thru. Every single experience has been excellent. The order takers are polite, they get my order correct, and the service is fast. The food never disappoints. My mouth is watering for a Baconator as I type this...."}
{"text":"This your typical Wendy's fast food joint with their regular brand menu and special offerings. As an occasional junk food eater I've over the years dutifully tried everything on their menu at least once.  So as to make it easy to gauge each of these eateries, when I do try them, I've devised a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being outright down and dirty nasty, and 5 being the best a fast food joint can be! I gauge: cleanliness; service; product quality and consistency; convenience; accessibility; taste and the personnel's attitude and customer service level. This place scores 4.5 of 5. I will come back here and do recommend it!  Could not find anything wrong, but good, Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"This is cleanest fast food restaurant I have ever been in. The tables, floor and booths shine. As soon as a customer leaves, the table - booth is cleaned.  My burger was cooked to perfection. The lettuce, tomato and onion were fresh and cold. The fries perfect. Dave would be very proud of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible. Hamburger was medium rare.  Sick for NEW Years. THANKS WENDY's. One place to avoid. Stick with In-Out. At least they are consistent"}
{"text":"I am not  a huge fast food fan. My pal made me go for a frosty. But I did try a bite of the burger with pretzel bun and it tasted almost as good as the $10 burgers nearby. For hot days, the Frosty can't be beat. Fast drive thru, nice location. No issues."}
{"text":"There's bugs everywhere????? All over the drive up window... actually all the windows in general. Pretty gross."}
{"text":"Thanks for the cold burgers tonight. I really like my dinner cold. It was SOOOOO good. I like the way you handed me my \"hot\" food, then made me pull around the corner to wait on my salad for five minutes. Still, despite the wait, my burgers shouldn't have been ice cold. Somehow you managed to hand them to me ice cold, then made me wait some more to make them even colder. Not to mention, I was the ONLY person in the drive thru. The people who work in this dump are very skilled at sucking and have raised being terrible to an artform. You must have hired some world class nimrods."}
{"text":"Worst service on earth!  I was at the drive thru on September 5th 2017 at 3:45pm and was refused to be served because I was simply speaking English.   There renovations/construction being done inside so drive thru was only available. I asked very nicely if there was someone that could speak English and the unfriendly angry employee said no so many times. After a few minutes that she kept refusing me I had to leave because she did not want to serve me. Never in my life that I had an employee working at a fast food chain raising their voice at me because I was speaking \"english\".   This has never happened to me in my life until I came to this specific Wendy's on Jean Talon and Viau. It is really unacceptable to be treating a costumer this way."}
{"text":"I believe Wendy's is the best fast food restaurant around.  Although their burger patties are a little small, the quality and price makes up for it.  The service is always friendly and substitutions are easy.  My only knock would be that there are no locations downtown."}
{"text":"Remodeled and reopened!  This has to be the nicest Wendy's I have ever been into!  They even have charging ports at the counter in front of the windows.  Beautiful interiors, decent service"}
{"text":"Went here Monday just about 5 pm. Food was not fresh. Fries were warm and limp, not hot and crisp. Home style chicken sandwich was barely warm and not crisp at all. I ate in the restaurant, so please don't think that the food was sitting in a bag for a while. I could not even finish my food. My stomach was uneasy that evening and all of Tuesday as well. First visit to this Wendys  location and the last."}
{"text":"Ordered a Double Baconator with lettuce, tomato, and onions. Burger was made to order. I walked all the way down to the end of the Concourse to eat it. When I opened the burger, it had zero bacon on it. I was to hungry and really did not have a lot of time before my flight to go back and have them remake the burger. The burger itself was hot and tasty - BUT, no bacon = EPIC FAIL!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch one afternoon. Ordered a low-carb double bacon cheeseburger (no bun) with lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles - no fries, and a bottle of water.  They provide the foot to you in a small plastic container. Burger was as tasty as it can be for a fast food burger of this sort.  Service was good, restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is located inside of Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. Got a Double Bacon Cheeseburger - with tomato, lettuce, and onion - sans bun - to go.  The first time they tried to give me my order, the screwed it up and had it on a bun. I made them re-make the burger, this time it was served in a little plastic tray.  It was hot and tasty and hit the spot to tide me over for the flight from Charlotte to Houston."}
{"text":"Should have checked Yelp. This place is gross. Dirty. The AC was broken and got as hell. And my medium meal was almost 10 bucks. Wow how is this place allowed to stay open? STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid this place if you can. I stopped and I was the only one there. I should have known. Every table was dirty. Kind of disgusting actually. I ordered my meal. 8 bucks and some change. my burger was dry but better than raw I guess. My frys were burnt so bad I took them back. I waited and waited and no one noticed me. FINALLY someone helped me. By the time I got new frys my burger was almost done. This location is the old style where they still give you your drink. it needs a makeover BALDLY. THE girls who served me were nice enough... no issues there. They just need some SERIOUS help."}
{"text":"it's wendy's gross!!!  haha the place looks great after the update. Layout is terrible actually doesn't really work efficiently when ordering and getting food when its crowded. Just backs up all awkwardly..   the food is the same so guess what...i won't be back...  only yelping this because its a check in and i hate seeing things i need to review when i sign on."}
{"text":"Thank you for being here next to Walmart for our fishing license.  Honestly, this was the best place for a quick lunch after our less than stellar dinner at Panera the night before.  I had the Mediterranean salad and my wife had the berry salad.  My personal favorite was the berry salad but now changed to the Mediterranean salad with their coucous and olives.  My father-in-law had his coffee fix and everyone else was happy with the menu selection."}
{"text":"No ice In ice machine, told them they said they're waiting on the ice. 30 minutes still no Ice. And What  happened to the fries?  They use to be thick, they've gotten skinnier!!!   I don't think Dave would be happy!"}
{"text":"I live across the street and have been going here for years. I've had many friends work here over the years so of course I had great service. Even though they don't work there anymore and I don't know anyone who works there now, i still get great service. A few nights I have noticed that they would be extremely busy, yet the employees still have a smile on their face. The other night I stopped by and the girl at the window who I've seen before gave me an extra nugget :) score!!!! She's really nice."}
{"text":"Its a Wendys.  Its always packed.  People in this area seem to only eat out and never cook at home.  Its cheap and people seem to love it.  America in all its glory.  Kids working here are always fast and nice.  They take coupons no problem.  Pimpin' Dave T would like the hell outa this one...."}
{"text":"This is the most poorly run Wendy's to which I've ever been. Avoid if possible. You will wait forever for your food, the staff is slow and hostile."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Wendy's I have ever been too. I don't know what happened because they weren't always this way. I never have an issue with employees, but over the last couple of months the wait when you go to the drive thru is way too long. Today, I pulled in the drive thru and it was three cars ahead of me. I waited for about 7 mins and the first car was still sitting at the menu board waiting for their order to be taken. I pulled off, went down the street to Cook-Out where there was one car ahead of me and when I rode back by Wendy's, the 1st car that was in line when I was there was waiting at the pick-up window. If you go here you better be prepared to be there for at least 15-20 minutes and that's only if it's a couple of cars ahead of you."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, upon leaving the Back Alley late at night, we were craving junk food. I had perhaps slightly overindulged, as apparently the only words that left my mouth from that point on were \"BACONATOR!!!!!!\", a burger which I had previously derided as disgustingly unhealthy but in my heart of hearts desired. It was just burger, cheese, mayo and bacon. So terrible, yet so tempting.  Apparently, upon being handed my burger, all words ceased and we ate some of it in the parking lot until heading home. I also apparently got bacon in my friends car. He is a vegetarian. Oops. :(  So I propose: this Wendy's, being open late and home to a lot of baconators, is evil. Super evil, and I am innocent of baconating.  ... I still dream of that burger, but I must never eat it again."}
{"text":"Wendy's new BREAKFAST blows!  I've never been a huge fan of Wendy's food, however seeing their big window sign of their new breakfast sandwiches drew me in.  My God they looked good!  And my God was I disappointed.    I had a sausage biscuit with a kick ass looking buttermilk bun that was infused with syrup.  The meat was spicy (ala McDonnalds) but the rest was just yucky.  I highly recommend you skip Wendy's for breakfast.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Drive thru had no issues. Fast and what I asked for. Not a huge Fast Food person but sometimes for lunch I need a quick bite. Fast and the Grilled Chicken sandwich is pretty good."}
{"text":"They couldn't get an order right after 3 times of repeating it. The girl had to call another employee over to finish taking the order. They even verbally executed it properly back to us and still got it wrong.  So I came home without a burger. That I paid for.   Check your bag before you leave is what I advise."}
{"text":"The Hispanic guy with the salt and pepper hair is EXTREMELY rude.  He looked at me with a stone face when I asked 3 times for a straw, finally he gave it to me. Wow all that for a straw!!!?? Won't go to this Wendy's  again"}
{"text":"Ghetto to the core! Worker starting her shift digging down her drawers (yum!), Hobos wandering in with cups (no Wendy's cups in some cases, perhaps the hobos with Wendy's cups got them out of the trash?) then the hobos help themselves to the self serve drink machine, then to top it off, two young gentlemen sitting next to our table came in with their own cups and an empty 2 liter and filled them up at the self serve drink machine, sat down and proceeded to mix the soda with cough syrup. Sizzurp!  Needless to say, I won't be returning, this place need a security guard! Future customers beware!"}
{"text":"So Emily at the PUW couldn't answer my question about a salad that was on the menu so she says \"just a sec\" and then disappears without any explanation.  Then a young man continues the conversation.  I ask the weight of the salad and he tells me \"just a minute.\"  He comes back and tells me they aren't a set amount, they all vary.  I inquired about the type of apples on one of the salads and I'm told red and green. I'm tired of ordering food and the employees knowing nothing about what they're selling.  No clue how many ounces in the beverages, no idea the weight of meat on a sandwich or what toppings are on it so they have to put you on 'hold\" so they can ask someone else. I accept this lack of info, complete my order, pay, and as I begin to drive off I observe two guys and at least one girl finding this situation particularly humorous. So the (clueless) customer is funny now?  Bleu cheese on my salad was warm which seems strange. Thanks for making my dining experience after a long day of volunteering, painting, and then yardwork a pleasant end of the day."}
{"text":"Wheres the beef!?  Wendys has always been a place to go when we dont wanna make dinner. It has def changed some items, like their fries, which I am now not a fan of! I liked the old fries, they were sometimes mushy but sooooo good! The prices are also always fluctuating, it used to be a JBC was .99 then 1.19, 1.29, and now its 1.69 I think. You can basically get a cheeseburger deluxe for like .99 but its that dang bacon that gets ya! What we usually always get are the small frosties and a small fry to dip them in it : ) YUMM!!  I like this Wendys bc theyre quick, and have great customer service! Ive never had any bad experiences... YET! LOL.   Go here for your chocolate frosty with fries fix!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and use to go here in the past but I am never going here again.  I will wait in the line across the street.  The fries were cold and soggy.  The burger was cold and squished.  The chicken sandwich looked good, but was root temp and the chicken was mushy.  The lady working the drive through just took the money, gave the change, and closed the window.  Not friendly.  If I was the owner of this place, I would make some changes fast."}
{"text":"typical old, needs a reno. kinda smaller seating.  drive thru available.  whole store closes  2am though.  no amex"}
{"text":"One of the newer, more modern stores.  Even the seating aren't those cheap slippery plastic ones, more of a light-colour wood finish.  Went to drive-thru to get a chocolate Frosty, a dessert after my sushi takeout, that's a winning combination ;)  No amex here."}
{"text":"Wow... What a Wendy's! This is hands down the nicest one I've ever been in. It looks brand spanking new, and it's got some of the nicest design I've ever seen in a fast food restaurant. They even had a gas fire thing that was beautiful!  The ordering left some to be desired, but the food was great, and I particularly loved the coke machine! It's one of those new ones with a touchscreen... And it has every flavor and coke product you could ever think of! It's absolutely incredible.   I don't ever want to go to another Wendy's, if just because I loved the ambiance and food quality at this one! I'm very impressed!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty hit or miss. On a good day, the food is fresh and delicious, and the staff is friendly and polite. On a bad day, nothing comes out the way it should and the frostys even suck. How can a Wendy's mess up a frosty? I have no clue.   I did just discover that their morning potatoes are better than McD's hashbrown patty, an accomplishment that I did not think was possible - the crispy little polygons are spiced to delicious perfection and are a great compliment to the square (ciabatta-eqsue?) sausage muffin. Morning heartburn? Yes, but probably worth it, and also the reason Tums exist."}
{"text":"Food is normal wendys. You get what you expect. sort of. Customer service is absolute crap, and even after repeating the order 3 times at the drive-up and then another two times at the first window where they take your money, one would expect that the order would be right. Of course it wasn't. So we stayed at the pickup window, hoping someone would open the window and noticed that our order was not correct. Of course not! Instead we had to knock on the window several times, finally the manager came up asked about the order, and said oh we're really sorry have a good day. No offer to fix it no offer to check out what was wrong, we had to park and walk inside to get it corrected. That took another 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is consistently slowest and most disorganized restaurant that I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Wow...... worst experience I have ever had that dumb bitch in the drive thru told us to pull into a parking spot because our order was too large. After sitting in the parking lot for 20 mins an employee came out took our money walked back in and another employee gave out our food but, did not receive any change from my total. Stay away from this place folk tonia the manager needs to understand what customer service is."}
{"text":"By faaaaaar, the slowest Wendy's in the country. Slow enough that it made me actually write a yelp review on it. Think about it!"}
{"text":"They have wi-fi."}
{"text":"The new salads are worth a try and I like Baja & Cobb.   Get $2 off full-size salad and any W burger after completing survey on back of receipt. I did it and that's how I tried the salad. Normally, I'm skeptical but it's better than any other fastfood salad I've had. Calories clearly provided & I make alterations but it works!  Lately, the best service has been the Fish Hatchery location. But Westside is cool enough. Great location.   Oh! The $1 mini free frosty key card is in the area now. Whoo-ooo."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0 stars. Consistently gets order wrong. They are so quick to throw your food at you that if they took a few extra minutes to look at what they were preparing they may get the order right. Food no longer tastes good either. Will drive to a farther Wendy's out of my way just to get a correct order."}
{"text":"Worst place ever what a shame, just moving to Charlotte, very displeased think I will drive 11 miles down the road next time. Food Service Sanitation score 96 to high for the quality of food this location."}
{"text":"Could the service be anymore slower?? I went in to eat after doing some shopping, and the place was dead empty. I swear each worker there was moving in slow motion; and when I asked for ketchup I got the meanest stare from the cashier. Also, they really, really skimp out on the toppings. I ordered the Bacon Fondue fries, and they barely gave me any fries and only a few squirts of cheese. I asked for more, and the girl lied right to my face and said they had no more. It's fast food, so I didn't expect much; but still! Come on!"}
{"text":"A year ago they used to be very good...they were quick and orders correct.  Now they are pretty bad....foods cold, orders are wrong, they don't apologize for screwing up your order. Won't be coming back to this location again, we will drive 8 miles out of our way if we EVER again want Wendy's."}
{"text":"Wanted to go get a burger today. Figured out Wendy's burned down. At least I still know that their burgers are #neverfrozen. Still love you Wendy's."}
{"text":"Terrible service, got my order messed up more than once and today was by far the worst, not only they messed it up but they said my debit card was not working, they never apologized for their error, since they said my card didnt work I just left without their food, just to find out my debit card DID work, thankfully my bank backed me up and the charges were reversed, HORRIBLE service DONT GO THERE"}
{"text":"My first time at Wendy's. I didn't expect too much, but they still managed to disappoint me. I got the cheeseburger with a baked potato with sour cream and chives and the bacon fondue fries, my fiance got chicken burger and also the highly anticipated bacon fondue fries. Best things first: they have one of those fancy soda machines that make my German tourist heart sing (vanilla ginger ale, yes!) and I really enjoyed the burger. Unfortunately, the bacon fondue fries were extremely sparse on the bacon and the fondue cheese sauce was not cheesy, what left us with soggy wet fries. Delicious. But the worst by far was the baked potato. I was sure nobody can mess up something as simple yet delicious as a baked potato - until today. The potato itself had zero flavor, the bland chives could not cut through that gustatory boredom, and if you think \"well, butter and sour cream will make it palatable\", oh no, not with the light (!) sour cream and low fat butter free butter spread they give you. It is a fast food restaurant, do you think I'd go there if I was on a low fat diet?  Two stars for the quick and friendly service, the soda machine and the delicious burger."}
{"text":"I arrived at lunch time to this Wendy's it was super busy 15min wait for food... The food was good if I was in the mood for Wendy's again I would go back to this location again."}
{"text":"I try to avoid Fast Food but from time to time it is convenient. Such was the case the day I stopped at this Wendy's location. If I do go for Fast Food, Wendy's is at the top of the short list. This was a pretty standard location. Nothing extraordinary, nothing overly offensive. It is what it is. My order was taken and filled in a timely fashion. The food was served hot and the fries were freshly made. My burger was juicy and flavorful. It could have been a lot worse. In fact, I've had far worse. If I had one complaint it would be that the pop machine seemed like it could use some maintenance. It was spurting a lot and the pop tasted kind of flat in my opinion. It really wasn't worth my time to say anything and I figured the syrup box was just getting to the end of the line. As far as Fast Food goes, I'd say you are safe here."}
{"text":"Just went through drive thru and cashier Christopher was very pleasant and attentive. That's the kind of customer service we need, definitely will keep giving them my business. Also the manager at the next window was great as well!!"}
{"text":"I got a 4 for 4 the shit was old and fucking cold .I got it at 930 at night , I called the manager on duty at 9:45 pm .who worked on 12/20/16 and she was fucking horrible .if I get sick ima Be your fucking boss !"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times but today the food and service was excellent. They even had someone in the lobby asking how our food was, cashier was nice, restaurant was clean and lots of available seats. They have the coolest soda machine too. Lots of flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I order a chicken sandwich and they gave me a burger. I asked for honey mustard and they gave me BBQ. Why would you even ask what I want to order if you're going to enter it wrong anyway? I'll give you 2 stars because you were polite and at least said thank you."}
{"text":"If you have an extra 20-25 minutes to sit around and wait in the drive through due to the slowest service you have ever seen, then this is the single greatest and most consistent place for you. I have never ONCE come to this place (and I live right around the corner so that is quite frequently) and not had to wait 20-25 minutes. It is BAFFLING. even with only one car in front of me in the drive thru will I wait that long. I would in truth never ever recommend this particular Wendy's to even my worst enemy. It bugs me THAT much."}
{"text":"Say all you want about this Wendy's having a nice interior, with comfortable seats and flat screen TVs.   But does all of that even matter when you get shitty service -- especially when in the drive thru? No.  The last 3 times I've gone through the drive thru because: A) I'm in a rush to get going and B) the lines are always very short.   However, every time I get horrible service. The girls taking my order at the speaker and then taking my money at the window look like they hate their lives and their jobs. Like, are you serious? At least smile or say \"Hello\". I'm giving you business. There should be no reason to not be thankful that I am spending money at your over-priced fast food joint.   When I asked if I could replace a lemonade with the standard drink, I was told yes. I was not told, however, that there was an upcharge. Jesus, the least you could do is inform the customer that they would have to pay a little bit more, and then ask if that was okay. As petty as that sounds, it's just good customer service.   I'm not sure why I keep returning to this particular Wendy's, but I know I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"poision to begin with so i got a salad. my salad had a piece of plastic and a super long strand of black hair.  fuck dave thomas."}
{"text":"So giving this place a three-star is a rather large fete for me. I have made it one of my life's missions to steer clear of Wendy's. I mean, they have SQUARE burgers. And before you give me the whole, \"You realize that you can shape round patties into other shapes\" speech, I know, and understand that. I also don't want to eat a heart patty, or a star patty for that matter. I like my burger's round. Just like God intended. :P  Hubby and I were driving around in north LV shopping and we were starving. As I was checking my Yelp app and he was driving we kept passing a bunch of ma and pa places that had horrific reviews. I haven't eaten Wendy's in forever because I don't like the square patties. Back in the day I'd eat chili or a baked potato. I decided that if I was going to attempt a square burger, it may as well be in good ol' Las Vegas with my hubby. Libby R. and Sandra Z. swear by how awesome Wendy's burgers are that I feel that there must be something that has changed.   I ordered their 1/4 lb. cheeseburger combo with a baked potato. The meat was... eh. It actually tasted the same as McDonald's. The fixings were great and the bun was nice and soft. What would make me go back is their baked potato. It was very tasty and a nice change from the regular old fries.  Since this visit I had the chance to eat Wendy's again but declined. Maybe Wendy's just isn't for me."}
{"text":"Well, that girl we all know that is \"Always Fresh\" and \"Always Juicy\" is hanging out here at Terminal 2 at Sky Harbor Airport. (Isn't that conflicting images? Just Sayin'!)  No, she isn't waiting to meet a Pilot sugar daddy. She is here to give him some of her hot goodness.   Dave's little girl is all grown up now, even though she still has freckles and pigtails.   Of course I am talking about Wendy. Who did you think I was talking about?  When I lived here in the Valley of the Sun 6 years ago, this Terminal was pretty sad, old and tired. But they have done their best to update it, and add more fast food choices, like Wendy's.   I haven't tasted Wendy's Hot and Juicy offerings in a long time.   They now have many breakfast combos including an attempted upscale sausage egg melt panini. They also have what the military would call S.O.S, or commonly known as \"Sh*t On a Shingle\" (Creamed chipped beef on toast). But here it is on their biscuit, true to there southern image, although I believe their HQ is in suburban Ohio. They have several SOS type options, including sausage and chicken.  I tried the $4.59 2 sausage and egg burrito combo. It sounds like a great deal until you realize  that the burritos are about the size of a Milky Way bar.   Still, like Wendy, they were Fresh and Juicy."}
{"text":"This location has been awful compared to my experiences with the one down the street, closer to Eastern & Serene. My order is always wrong or incomplete at this location. It's sub par & that being its fast food, it's just gross/indelible. Don't bother!"}
{"text":"Food was fine. It took three tries to get our order right through the drive thru speaker, not sure if she couldn't hear me or what. Drove around to window and there was trash and empty cups where people had sat out their old stuff. The trash in the parking lot honestly made me question the cleanliness of the restaurant. If you don't care enough about what the outside looks like then what condition is the inside? It was alright but if I'm ever in the area again I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I gave this location two chances. My first visit I was given old cold fries in my kids meal. The second trip my son's plain baconator had cheese on it. It isn't hard to serve quality food people."}
{"text":"Don't come to this location unless you enjoy being harassed by pan handlers while you are trying to order and eat. The staff do nothing to solve the problem and let them harass the paying customers.  I've personally had to call the police while on my lunch break."}
{"text":"It's fast food, you can't expect much.  I rarely eat at these places unless I have too.  Today I had to because I needed to go to the grocery store and I don't go hungry. The food is.......Wendy's so I judge on how safe I feel eating it by who's serving it and from what I saw I wasn't good.  The girl taking our order at two thirty on March 15th was rude just plain uninterested in her job.  We ordered combos and we didn't get cups.  When we asked for them she looked at us like we were aliens.  She never said thank you, your welcome or go to hell. She  hardly said anything.  I must add that it was not busy at all, go figure.  While we were eating we got to watch all the employees giggling and laughing and goofing off in general........except the kid with crazy orange hair.  He seemed to be working his butt off and not getting evolved in the antics.  But we weren't the only ones watching.  Everyone there turned to watch what was going on behind the counter. I work in a high school, so I know teenagers and I'm not quick to judge them But what I saw made me very leery of what I ate.  If I owned that franchise I would dump every one except the kid with the crazy orange hair and the older Hispanic lady cleaning the tables.  When you run a place like Wendy's you can't rely on the food, it's all pretty much the same, you have to have good customer service and next time I'm in that area and need to eat I'm going to jack in the box."}
{"text":"I am would give this Wendy's zero stars if I could. The worst customer service. Food was cold and employee were rude and not helpful at all. I have will never go back to this location again. Nothing was fresh at all!!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars is for the simple, fun ordering, brewed ice tea and dependable food items for this airport location, surprisingly.   I love me my chili. I asked for cheese and onion. Added 2 packets of their milky hot sauce and a couple of crackers and enjoyed its warm hug in my tummy.  The hamburger and sour cream potato eater had no complaints in that everything was fresh and warm. Tastes how a standard Wendy's fare should be.  Love me my fresh brewed tea as well! Got the unsweetened and even got a quick refill! Order taker Forochehr has a sweet personality that shown through during our order interaction."}
{"text":"This Wendy's ALWAYS AND I MEAN ALWAYS has the worst service. Currently been in the drive thru for 15 min. I wouldn't even be here if chipotle Had not run out of cheese"}
{"text":"This is the filthiest Wendy's I've ever been in. It's 4pm, the place is empty except the two of us and we had to ask them to clean a table for us.  ALL of them were dirty. She cleaned one.  Here it is."}
{"text":"I was going to write a scathing review about how horrible this particular Wendy's location is at customer service but there is no need, everyone on here already beat me to it! I am still going to eat at Wendy's anyways, their burgers are just that good. Just stay away from this location."}
{"text":"Burnt down and reopened recently.  The rebuild is nice and modern...too bad they couldn't rebuild their customer service too. But I guess it is your typical fast food place filled with unhappy employees and wrong orders with decent food."}
{"text":"I don't want to give this location any stars whatsoever the customer service was rude the food was even put together right this is a bad location for customer service. So if you don't care about customer service come to this location but if you like customer service go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Hands-down the worst service I've ever received at a fast food joint very rude and not patient at all and I'm pretty sure manager was standing right there when they were being rude that's for my negative post for the day I was in joy Wendy's hamburgers and fries in there and the chocolate Frosty's but I won't be going back to the one on Sahara and Cimmaron!"}
{"text":"What happened to this location?! It used to be full of great people and the food was outstanding! Now, the employees are either high or stupid and the food is terrible. Charles messed up both orders so we didn't even get what we wanted. The washroom was a disgrace and the counter with the drink lids smelled SO bad.  Get your act together Wendy's!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendys I have been to.  The fries tastes like the fish, and they were soggy.   The fish was over cooked and swimming in tarter sauce.  The best part of the meal was the coke zero.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS WENDYS."}
{"text":"if i could rate this negative i would this place sucks they take forever to take ur order even in the drive through go to mc donald's"}
{"text":"When this Wendy's opened, it was extremely well-run.  The staff was on point, and the managers did a great job of moving things along.    That lasted for about a week.  Since then, it's become an embodiment of everything bad about fast food.  The employees are really dredged from the bottom of the barrel here.  On more than one occasion, I've had someone completely stop taking my order to talk at length with some friends who had just walked in.  Orders-- even incredibly simple orders-- are routinely botched.  The restaurant has flies.  I'm glad that there's a Wendy's on State Street.  I just wish that it wasn't such a crappy Wendy's."}
{"text":"I would give it a negative if it let me. Stopped to try and get some supper, we were the only ones in line and the lady behind the counter never acknowledged us - not a hello or I'll be right with you. She just kept getting a couple orders ready. Very rude and disrespectful. We waited 5 minutes and she still totally ignored us, I finally said that's fine we'll go somewhere else to eat and she still was rude and didn't apologize. Her manager should fire her and hire someone with better customer service. They weren't busy so no excuse for her."}
{"text":"Now I realize this is fast food so I'm not expecting a gourmet meal, but is getting the food I ordered really too much to ask?? This Wendy's is so ridiculous it's almost humorous. EVERY SINGLE TIME I go they screw up my order. I think I'll just start ordering the opposite of what I want, that seems to be the only way I will have a chance of getting what I want.  And these morons want $15 an hour.. HA!"}
{"text":"We were moving this week and when you can get a great deal like four for four, everyone's happy. And sometimes, after eating healthy and clean for a while, you just want something salty and greasy. My meal was a bacon double burger meal and let me tell you, it hit the spot. I don't recommend eating like this daily though."}
{"text":"There's not an option for zero stars. My mom and I stopped for lunch. I ordered spicy chicken sandwich (no tomato). Got tomato, no biggie, I took it off. My mom ordered a hamburger, the clerk responded \"you mean cheeseburger?\". My mom reiterated no cheese. Burger has cheese. My mom is not in good health, so I took it to the counter. The mgr, Elizabeth, met me and argued with me about 'no cheese' being indicated at time of order. C'mon, the mgr, arguing over cheese vs no cheese...  None of the above is earth shattering, but this is what topped it all. My mom ordered a Frosty. Two bites in, she finds a dead fly in the Frosty. I took it to the counter, Elizabeth was there to greet me (lucky me) again. She could have been less apologetic. Then asked if I wasn't sure the fly didn't just fly in there. It was dead, that's how I was sure. It didn't just land and keel over. RIDICULOUS.   This location SUCKS. Mostly because the mgr, Elizabeth, has absolutely NO PEOPLE SKILLS. It's absurd what happened, but her reaction was despicable."}
{"text":"What is fast bout this shit ass place that calls thereself wendys. Food is cold service is slow aint nothing fast about the shit at all. I will never ever buy food from this wendys again."}
{"text":"I am a longterm customer of this Wendy's location. The employees are friendly and the food is fairly constant. They take care of their regulars.  For the most part the dining room is clean. Occasionally, when they are busy, the dining room gets a little messy, but not bad.  Overall, this is a nice Wendy's to visit."}
{"text":"Yet another fast food place that cannot understand \"no .....\" mayo in this case. I don't want a burger with the mayo scraped off, then asked, what's my problem? Dave is rolling over in his grave!"}
{"text":"I've generally loved Wendy's food. Their spicy nuggets have been a staple to my diet for a long time, and the 4 for 4 deal is fantastic. However, the service at the Union Wendy's is absolutely horrendous. It took roughly 10 minutes for my 4 for 4 to be made, and when I received it they failed to give me the small fries as well. I went back to the counter to ask for the fries, but nobody would even acknowledge the fact that I was there. I then got an employee's attention by shouting and asked about my fries, and she stated it would be out soon. Well they finished a batch of fries and delivered them through other orders, leaving me to wait there roughly 20 minutes for my missing small fries. The fact that I had to wait 30 minutes to order and fix their mistakes and didn't even receive a simple \"sorry\" speaks volumes to the inadequacies at the Union Wendy's. Despite being a long-time lover of Wendy's, I can safely say I will never be going back to this one."}
{"text":"I've never had an experience like the other reviewer and have been going here for years. It is currently closed for remodeling but I will continue going here once it reopens."}
{"text":"Great Wendy's there server Shanell is such an asset to this location. We come in everyday and she just makes our day. Big smile, great service. Keep up the good work Wendys."}
{"text":"Had an asshole named James who completely hates his job and it's obvious he hates his job, I drove up to the drive through order screen, waited about 45 seconds and didn't hear anything, I said hello? Just to see if anyone could hear me, nobody answered and I never got a reply, so I drove around to the window, James, the awesome guy that he is, in his 60's or so still working at Wendy's opens the window and just stares at me, I said hey are you guys open yet? He just stared at me again and says yeah I asked you what you wanted to order and what did you want? I said oh I'm sorry I honesty didn't hear a single thing, he replied with K, and I said okay, he then said what do you want? At this point I'm actually pretty pissed off, because not only is it not my fault your piece of shit ordering screen or mic and speaker don't work correctly but to be asked, \"what do you want\" like I'm impeding on his life in such a negative way, I rarely ever write reviews but seriously this guy needs a serious talking to on customer service or just plain politeness towards another human being, what a scum bag, and of all days it was Mother's Day, so I truthfully asked myself, do I want to be in his position working a shit job at Wendy's at 60 plus years old, you know what, more than likely I don't, so here's to you James, for not caring enough about your life to do something more meaningful than to be a complete dick head at the place that gives you a paycheck to pay your bills  Love, the customers who keep shit holes like this in business"}
{"text":"I love this location. Best service I have ever gotten at a fast food Resturant. Been coming here for a few years and every time my service is just as good! Keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"This is the saddest Wendy's I've ever been too. I came here about a month ago and it was not only the slowest service (it was lunch, so I understand) but it was the rudest service. There was a guy in training at the register who clearly wasn't comfortable and his manager was just plain mean and not helpful. I felt so bad for the kid that I regret ordering and wanted to go elsewhere just so I didn't have to watch that treatment of an employee any further."}
{"text":"Must be the slowest fast food workers I have ever seen. To stand at the counter for 3-5 mins before even being greeted when there's 4 people in the kitchen and only me inside and one car in the drive thru is pretty bad service"}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised that this place has gotten such low reviews, and I can only assume that their game must have come up quite a bit since some of these.  I normally wouldn't review a fast food chain but this place is clean, quiet and I've never had an issue.  I actually drive an extra couple of minutes to go to this location rather than the one down on Glendale Ave.  Also, let me just say, YOU HAVE TO TRY THE NEW BREAKFAST!  I love a good chicken biscuit, and the one they serve has got honey butter on it as well.  Wendys has really upped the ante for breakfast fast food.  Try it out, you'll love it!!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a month against my better judgement but I'm always hoping for a finger in my chili. I never try any of their new sandwiches or anything I stick to the chili. It's by no means good but hell it's less than $2 and it helps everything come out easier in the morning."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is the worst. Went to get a fish sandwich before they stopped selling them. The lady at the window asked if I would mind waiting four minutes..of course not! I was on a mission to acquire this fish sandwich and devour every bite. About 6 mins go by and they tell me they're out of fish.... WHAT. My other must have for this trip was strawberry lemonade, I LOVE their strawberry lemonade. But alas they didn't have that either. So this was a big ol bowl of disappointment. I settled for a chicken sandwich. Bottom bun was very hard. Chicken was eh. I won't ever be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"Fries are under-cooked and wet; I ordered sandwich without pickles but still has pickles."}
{"text":"Got the order wrong....  I am with Bob R.  how hard is it to get the order right.  You will gladly take my money for an upgrade but when it isn't in the bag, that sucks."}
{"text":"Typical Wendy's menu. They don't have a breakfast menu just their usual menu. I asked for a small soda and got charged $1.99 for a fountain drink that on their sign says $1.50. Watch out their sneaky.."}
{"text":"this was probably the worst service I've ever had. I walk in and the lady at the register is completely rude. I order my food and sit down fifteen minutes pass and still no food...WORST SERVICE YOU WILL EVER RECEIVE. The store is also dirty, all the tables and counters look like a hot mess. I would not recommend this. The only reason I put one star is because there was no other option. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Wendy's always says there food is cooked fresh, that's a lie. Our burgers look like they're a couple hours old and they taste like it too. The cashier never offered me a receipt. After taking our order she just walked away. There are flies that we have to keep swatting at. We should have known better when we showed up and there were 0 customers. Oh well at least we know to never come back here again."}
{"text":"Always always always extremely slow service. No matter how crowded or what time of the day or night. Most of the workers have been pleasant, apologetic about the wait times, except one particular drive-thru lady, a woman maybe in her early 20's who is straight up miserable all the time. I understand working in a food business rough days & dealing with crowds, but last time, they just basically threw the burger we ordered together, the patty wasn't even in the bun and it was a mess when we unwrapped it. I babysit in the area & pick up lunch on my way to the house. Keep telling myself to get lunch elsewhere, but everytime I give this place a chance they blow it"}
{"text":"Special order nothing special about it, I asked for extra mayonnaise and didn't get it my bread on my burger is soggy my lettuce was wilted and Old as fuck! Burger it self was not even hot"}
{"text":"For a Wendy's this place is hella clean....and fast. I stop here as i work across the street and I've always had hot fresh food.  Service is very friendly too which can be hard to find with fast food"}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's in the Pittsburgh area. The drive thru is so long of a wait. Check your order because they mess it up often. My drink was flat, and many times they will not provide you napkins or a straw."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I order the same thing. A junior cheeseburger with a cesar side salad. Every time I get the wrong items. I'm getting real tired of it. I've worked the drive thru at fast food places. It's seriously not that hard. Come on people...."}
{"text":"The price is good for a small frosty, 99 cents! It was a warm day and it melted pretty quick  and ended up being kind of messy... I went through the drive thru and the line was long but went quick."}
{"text":"Once again the order was wrong, I paid for food I did not receive. Management could care less, waste of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through, I was out in 80 seconds. Manager seemed very friendly, courteous. Food was cooked just right. I would come here again soon."}
{"text":"Went here late at night for dinner after a flight. Obviously the C team was on duty. Food was cold. Expected better"}
{"text":"Amazing service, we thought that they were open turned they were closed but still helped us and went out of there way. The team was amazing, thank you for your good customer service"}
{"text":"It surprises me that they charge $2.79 for a large green tea and refuse refills. They top off the cup up with ice and you can barely taste the green tea with so much ice. It's disappointing!!! They need to change their drink policy, it's making me not wanta eat there!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend looking for burgers for him and vegetarian for myself. I read online that since locations had a black bean veggie burger, NOT HERE! they also didn't have my go to: broccoli cheese potato :( so why 4 stars? The customer service! Jessica the manager was knowledgeable about the menus vegetarian options and variations. Even after I had just given up and went to the side salad, she helped me decide on something more substantial and tasty. You may say, \"of course the manager was good at customer service!\" But we all know that's just not always the case anymore. I would definately return to this location."}
{"text":"Please clean your floor properly.  It feels like Crisco under your feet.  Very dangerous."}
{"text":"My first emotions are good. Very clean as 4 me its the most important think. Good food. Bright light windows."}
{"text":"If you ever have the misfortune of working nights like I do, you will eat more fast food than you care to admit.  Options after 9pm are very limited when you forget to pack your \"lunch.\"  So in the mood for a burger and not having the patience to wait at In-N-Out, and unwilling to eat at McDonalds, I settled on the least of the evils with Wendy's.  I typically just order off Wendy's value menu.  While it's not the extensive 99 cent deals from the '90s, it's still cheap enough to make up for the lack of quality.  But I saw an ad that I just couldn't resist when I pulled up to the restaurant, a pretzel bacon burger.  I may be one of the few people in America that doesn't believe bacon makes everything taste better, but I do believe that everything tastes better on a pretzel bun.  Until now.  The first problem.  I received my order, then drove a few feet away from the window to take a look at what I got but not keep the car behind me waiting.  Although I asked for no bacon, take one guess what was on my burger.  Bacon.  Okay, I just picked it off.  But attention to detail at the drive-thru seems to not be Wendy's specialty.  I've lived in several parts of the valley in the 15 years I've lived in Arizona.  I've also driven thru several different Wendy's, and each location seems to make consistent mistakes.  Order a frosty; no spoon or even a straw (which is worthless with a frosty, anyway).  Ask for no mayo;  mayo remains on burger.  Ask for honey-mustard sauce for chicken nuggets; get barbecue sauce.  I don't have very high expectations for fast food employees, but my bar gets set even lower at any Wendy's. It feels like I always stopped driving thru the nearby Wendy's because of better options and constant mistakes.  The second problem.  When I bit into my burger, I immediately regretted this debauchery.  Flavor-wise and texture-wise, the cheap Wendy's burger patty just doesn't go with the pretzel bun.  The bun itself is pretty good, a firm crust but soft and light inside.  But the mixed greens offer little flavor and lacks the crunch of iceberg or even romaine lettuce.  And I cannot even properly critique the sauce.  I don't know what it was supposed to be, but it's just gross."}
{"text":"I don't cook at all so when I feel like a quick meal, the half-size Baja salad is where it's at for me."}
{"text":"This Wendy's location is pretty convenient... right off of Independence Blvd.  Really it's always been there since I've been in Charlotte so it's a great \"pit stop\" on the way home and you are craving some nuggets or a frosty.  Honestly I haven't really frequented this place as much as I used to (probably a good thing), but when I do...their service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Maybe I just hit it at the wrong time, but 12:30 on a Thursday, the drive thru line wrapped around the building TWICE!... After jockeying for a parking space, I walked in and the line was to the back of the dining area.  I walked away very hungry and frustrated as it took me another 10min to get out of the parking lot due to the wrapped drive thru line and all the cars trying to get in and out.   FAIL."}
{"text":"Stopped here to get a quick sandwich before hitting the road.  I'm always skeptical of gas-station/fast food restaurant pairings since there is always a lot going on, but I got in and out okay and the food hit the spot at that particular time.  I can imagine this place gets super busy during the summer once Carowinds opens up and there is a lot more traffic coming though."}
{"text":"Service was good and fast. I did spend most of my time trying to check in and realized this location had not been reviewed yet. Oh well.  Back at my computer and not at the mercy of my \"smart\" phone.  This location is always pretty busy - that's why I was so surprised that it had not been reviewed yet.  I didn't even get to check in either.  Back to the review.... the dining room is usually clean and they have a Ballantyne theme going on with some golf decor and pictures of the various holes on the golf course.  It does make the place feel a little out of it's element... it's still fast food with nice decorations.  I did also notice that the registers are pretty new-it has a monitor so that you can see what the cashier is entering for your order.  Big Con is the parking lot... it can get a little congested... add that with Charlotte drivers and BIG SUV driving suburban soccer moms... doesn't bode well for the diner who is looking for a good burger with little distractions in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Yet again Huntersville , NC location just throwing food in a bag, the matter what you order. You guys should come up with a new thing called the Mystery box, that's basically what I get every time I go to that particular location. Tonight I ordered six hamburgers all the same way, plain, no cheese, ... open the bag and to my surprise I have a multitude of variation. The one thing they did get right however was the word burger. They all have bread and meat. However the rest are variation of different artistic assemblies.   Maybe they will install a make it yourself bar. That way I could get something the way I ordered."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Wendys in a while, and now I see why, because the customer service is awful and the place was unclean. The employees wad talking in the back while ignoring the customers in the front. One employee came from out the back area and didn't even make eye contact, i literally had to say hello before he acknowledged me. It had a ghetto/ ratchet feel as well as look. I am never coming back here again. Darcy Spears, should put them on blast."}
{"text":"A fast food restaurant will never get over three stars from me...because, come on, it's fast food.  Confession: I have never been to a Wendy's ever, in my life. The last time I had fast food was at McDonalds over five years ago. Maybe I'm not up to date on the hip fast food scene any more.  All I know is that I really really really wanted fries, and they had good fries. They claim it's made with sea salt--an attempt at high-end fast food? The irony is greasy. I'm not a great judge on prices since I don't have much of a comparison basis, but Wendy's has a value menu with poutine, fries, chicken nuggets, etc, all for $1.89 each. Not too shabby."}
{"text":"After driving all around southend and this part of town trying to find a lunch spot that was not too busy, I ended up at the drive through here.  Ordering was a breeze except I they marked down sweet tea instead of unsweet.  So I pull around to the 1st window and tell the cashier.   She looks and it says sweet tea.  She yells through the building that it's supposed to be an unsweet tea.  Heck with updating the computer.  lol.  When I get to the 2nd window the lady confirmed it was an unsweet tea.  Woohoo, the yelling works!  LOL.   Actually the ladies were very pleasant about it. And that's one thing I've noticed about Wendy's lately.  Most of the employees are very pleasant.  Anyway, my order was one of their special bacon cheesburgers on the pretzel bun with fries and drink.  The fries were good but they were gone by the time I reached my destination.  I have a habit of that.   The burger was just ok.  The bun was kind of chewy and the burger had no flavor except for the bacon. The cheese was a cheese sauce which was meh.  But at least the tea was good.  But how can you screw up unsweet tea...well unless you give me sweet instead.  But that didn't happen this time around.     For the food, I'd give them a 2.  For the service and the ladies who made me smile, I'll give them a 3 1/2.. I'll do my creative division and average that to a 3."}
{"text":"No matter if you go inside or you go through the drive thru, this place has to be the slowest fast food joint around. Don't come here if you have limited time because you will wait.  On my most recent visit, I used the drive thru. Not only were they slow but the person ordering had no manners, people skills or common courtesy. When I got to the window, he just handed me my order and said \"Here\".   Along with that, I ordered my burger without mayo and it came with it anyway. I doubt I will be back here."}
{"text":"I make it known that I am not normally a fan of fast food places and especially drive through but I have to say I enjoyed my experience with this one the other day.  After running errands all over town on my lunch hour, I needed a quick bite to eat and for once this drive through line wasn't that long so I stopped.  The \"problem\" is the car I got behind.  I was listening to them carry on in the car.  They must have changed their order about 5 times.  As an employee, I would have been irritated but when I got up to the mic, the order taker was pleasant and when I got to the window she was smiling.  Must really enjoy her job.  For food, I ordered the Carolina Classic which is my favorite burger from Wendy's.  Burger, mustard, slaw, chili...mmmm yum!  And just enough mess to make it all worth while!  Wendy's fries with sea salt are really good too and they got my unsweet tea order right as well.  So Kudos to this Wendy's for dealing with difficult people in a positive way!"}
{"text":"For fast food, Wendy's is one of the better chains.  The burgers are decent, you can customize it the way you like and they don't look at you funny and the recent change on the fries is a great addition.  Of course Wendy's frosties are great too.  Their salads consistently get good ratings on the health meters (just watch out for those dressings loaded in fat).    For this location, it's down the street from where I work.  The drive through is open late every night -- or morning depending on how you see it.    The one problem I have here but it's my complaint with most fast food places drive thrus is sometimes you never know if you're actually going to get what you ordered.  For example, I always order unsweetened ice tea but half the time I get that deathly sweet sugary tea that is 1 part tea to 30 parts sugar.  Ugh.  Anyway, Wendy's is normally A-ok in my book."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru worker i have ever met in my life. Extremely rude. Could not hear anything over the speaker. When asked to repeat herself she had a massive attitude problem. When we asked for ketchup she rolled her eyes and blindly handed some over, dropping several on the ground."}
{"text":"I realize I am reviewing a fast-food eatery, but please hear me out because I wanted the world to know what I experienced at this particular location. This is kind of a public service announcement.  Originally I wanted to go through the drive-thru, but my husband insisted we eat inside. Once inside I was overtaken by the smell of dog food. I'm not even kidding. Straight up folks. I couldn't think of what else the smell would be. I couldn't bring myself to eat here. I told my husband we were leaving immediately.  I am not sure what makes that smell, but it does not belong in ANY place that is serving *human* food."}
{"text":"Fresh? Not so much. I got a mozzarella burger with wilted greens and rock hard bacon for $5+."}
{"text":"I made a trip here today to have the T-Rex burger made (secret order item), eat in, about 11:45 am, Friday. The manager and staff were quite nice and efficient.  The food was hot, and I like the new Coke machines which let you mix whatever flavor combo you like."}
{"text":"I decided to wait to review until I had been several times due to the low review scores.  Maybe the late night crew is much more efficient than the day crew, who knows. I usually go between 9:45 - 11:30 pm.   Each time, my order has been exactly the way I asked. I have been using the Wendy's special offer coupons in their app so the order is whatever happens to be on special.   I have had to wait each time a few minutes, but no big deal because that means it is fresh made I am guessing.   I wish they had online ordering through their app! If it gets close to closing time I use the Baseline and Ellsworth location because that one has the online app ordering capability.  Nevertheless, I haven't ever had an issue here at the Southern Ave store."}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food experience I have ever had. My daughters entire meal was not in our bag. When we got home I tried to call and they would not answer. After calling multiple times over about 45 min finally someone answered \"Hello\". I explained what my issue was and the manager said \"oh we have the wrong food to someone.\" She couldn't care less about the huge inconvenience her restaurant caused us on an already busy night. I will be contacting the GM and I WILL be getting a refund. I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"We love Wendy's..... really, we do.  However, this location screws up our order 3 out of the 5  times we visit.  Everything from missing fries and nuggets, to completely putting the wrong things on a burger.   The people there are nice enough and fix our order (hence, the 2 out of 5 stars instead of 1), but it is tiring to consistently deal with.  I feel bad for the staff because they seriously appear on the brink of simply giving up and breaking down -- so don't chew the staff out too hard if their cooks screw up or if the corporate office does not understand their plight!  If you do visit this location -- ALWAYS CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE.   Every time."}
{"text":"Solid Wendy's location. I come here for lunch sometimes and the food is hot, quick and the order is correct.   the workers are nice enough and they even asked if I wanted ketchup in the drive thru which is almost unheard of these days!  The new burgers, french fries and brewed iced tea is my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"Ordered a bacon portabella melt. I said twice, that I wanted onions on it. Got a little attitude from my order taker when they said \"I already put that on there.\" Got the burger, no onions, one mushroom on the entire burger."}
{"text":"After running around half the day I realized I hadn't eaten all day. My friend and I decided to stop with the kids. I had never realized there was a Wendy's here. It was surprisingly busy to me because it is located in a parking lot with a Kohl's and surrounded by houses near Marley Park. There were quite a few people in front of us and only one cashier, but she was doing great and was very fast. There were quite a few other employees to ensure things were going smoothly. I really liked how the supervisor was helping get the trays set up after every order was taken. The restaurant was clean and both the drink area as well as the ketchup, straws, napkin areas were spotless. That's huge to me! Every where you go I feel like this is the area that is forgotten about and disgusting. Great job keeping it clean and organized. My food was handed to me before I even found a seat. While eating my friends son made a mess on the floor (he's 10 months old) Within minutes a girl was there picking it up without us saying a word as we were still eating. Atmosphere was good. Quiet even with the tons of teens there for spring break. Great job Wendy's. This location I'd definitely recommend over all the other locations in Surprise. I only wish it was close to my house."}
{"text":"I stopped in to use the bathroom. Disgusting. A swarm of flies and a filth. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews of fast food establishments or places with many locations but I felt the need to write this one. I stopped at this Wendy's simply because I was in the area and it was the only one on the way to where I was going.  Upon entering this Wendy's i realized this was a slighter older location that hadn't been renovated. The bathroom was fairly disgusting and if I didn't have to drive 30 min I wouldn't have gone to begin with.   I ordered my 3 items and let me just tell you I almost instantly regretted it. It was 12:30 on a Sunday at this point and when I ordered the grilled chicken Asiago sandwich she had to yell to the back to see if the grill was ready. How can your drill not be ready when it's 12:30 already? I ordered everything else and proceeded to wait for my order with 3 other individuals who had been waiting far too long for a fast food restaurant.   I watched the staff working behind the counter and they were in absolutely no rush. It looked like they were just now getting things out for the day. Had they been prepared for the day maybe people wouldn't have been waiting forever. Even if you weren't prepared maybe you should chit chat a little less and get to work. When I entered the establishment one of the customers was already standing around waiting and after probably 5-7 min she told him it would be another 7min wait for whatever he ordered. Clearly because they weren't prepared.   I watched the person up front have no manners with another customer. He thought she had his order ready and proceeded to the counter to get it. Instead of explaining it was someone else's she just pulled the tray away from him and said \"no\". She then chuckled so he thought she was messing with him and tried to take the tray again. She then finally spoke actual words and told him it wasn't his. Basic communication skills if you walk me.  Needless to say I will never return to this Wendy's and I highly advise that you save yourself the hassle and go to another location."}
{"text":"I have been patronizing this location for many years and since the remodel this location was my preferred Wendy's spot. However, the last few months this location has been extremely dirty. I usually dine in and to not have one clean table out of twenty is unacceptable. Today the garbage can had ketchup all over, garbage visible behind the lids. A spoon lies on the floor next to the baby seats, spilled red kool aid on top of the garbage can. Every table base showed some type of food particles. Also Ice tea at this location is never brewed prior to 11:00am. I do however like the staff as they all seem nice and welcoming. I have not seen the manager here in a few weeks which could be the problem. I am going to take a break from this location as if the tables aren't clean I can only guess the rest."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's in town. I have been here a number of times, and every time I go, I wonder why I came back. I guess it's location, location, location. There used to be a Burger King across the street, but now, this is the only fast food in the area. I've never had a good experience here, ever. The staff is unhelpful, I'm not necessarily going to say rude, but unhelpful. If you get any promotional items, the Frosty's come to mind, they don't ever want to give you any. Theres always some new rule, restriction, or excuse why they won't honor it. The food is old, or mediocre, and I'm comparing this to other fast food, not higher tier restaurants, so they're on the bottom rung of fast food. I go out of my way now to go to another location to avoid this one. The location on Sunset near Mountain Vista, is my go to if I want Wendy's now."}
{"text":"I didn't even look for reviews of Wendy's.  I mean who would need to review a fast food joint.   Well next time I will.  One star is way too much for this place.  And it is averaging one star.  My visit happened on June 27,2018 at 6 pm at night. And I went in for my food. I did not use the drive through.  All I wanted was a salad. But I ended up leaving with a refund and no food.  I went in to this place and it seemed clean and no problems.  Well as I was waiting I happen to notice the lady with short red hair being very unclean.  She had gloves on. Which was awesome except for the following. She touched the headset she had on multiple times to readjust it.  She scratched her side.  She rubbed her nose. She touched the trash can. All while not changing her gloves afterwards.  She took the spoon that was in ketchup and banged the spoon against the trash to get rid of whatever was on the spoon. And put it back in the ketchup.  WTF!!!!  Who does that.  It touched the trash.  Change your gloves.  Toss spoon in sink.  Wash it.  I am completely disgusted by this place.  The manager on duty had very bad dandruff.  As he was giving me my money back. He bent over to get the money. And the dandruff in his hair was nasty. Wash your hair with head and shoulders dude.  I'm not happy.  I'm waiting on a response from the gm of the store.  Highly doubtful I'll receive the phone call. But go figure.  I want everyone on Yelp to stay away from this place.  It is not worthy of your money.    I don't like to leave reviews like this.  But I'm so upset right now."}
{"text":"First of all I like to say, when I got there I heard a gentleman complaining how they always make his cheeseburger wrong then I get mine and it's not plain, it has mayonnaise lettuce tomatoes. Plus look at the bacon really ? Maybe these employees need to start reading, what people order"}

{"text":"Food is even better here now that they've remodeled the place. Man, the place really looks nice now. They even added WiFi and some pretty nice tables and chairs."}
{"text":"Nice 99 cent menu... better then the then others that are around. The service was fast and friendly and the food was actually good.  I keep forgetting about this place for a quick bite out with the kids because its sort of hidden in a corner next to Dennys where the parking is mostly all for Dennys. Now I will try to remember because there is something for everyone on the value menu. And I will carry their coupons with me too just in case I do happen to stop by. They do happen to send out some awesome coupons that will even make it cheaper. yay!!!"}
{"text":"Decent value relative to the area, and I do like the nuggets. However, they're really stingy on refills. I got told today that I need to get a combo to get refills even though I've been dining there for the good part of the month."}
{"text":"This location does not pay attention to what their customers order.  I ordered a salad with crispy chicken and got grilled chicken the first time I was there, not too bad.  The second (and last time) I was there I ordered the Asian cashew chicken salad with crispy chicken and got grilled chicken and the BBQ ranch dressing.  The description says that it comes topped with fire-roasted edamame, spicy roasted cashews, warm, grilled chicken and Marzetti Simply Dressed Light Spicy Asian Chili Vinaigrette (containing roasted peanuts) for a salad that's anything but bland. Not even close to what I was handed.  I'm done with this Wendy's.  I would give NO stars, if possible."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, very professional the restaurant interior was clean and well maintained."}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars, I wouldn't even miss a beat in doing so! This is absolutely the worst fast food place I have ever eaten at - no questions asked!   We came in on a Saturday night, after watching a movie at the Galaxy. There was four of us and we were in a good mood and wanted something to eat that was quick and easy. Our mood was instantly ruined by the lovely associate at the counter, Nick. I've met my share of grumpy associates, but I think he takes the cake! We tried cracking jokes and lightening the mood, but Mr. Nick was not having any of it. He rolled his eyes and just gawked at us when ordering. Now it's dead empty on here. No one besides us was in here and he was just so miserable.   Fast forward to the food. Half of the order was wrong, with extra ingredients added we requested off and stuff we wanted on, not there. The soda was flat. The fries overly salted. They just did not give a single care in the world.   Now, I had to order an extra item after the fact and just suggested to the employee that he smile a little more that life wasn't that serious. Said employee made it a point to loudly discuss my comment and my party with the manager. Any intelligent person in customer service knows that the worst thing you can do is speak about the client, especially badly, in front of them.   Fast forward a bit more, and what seems to be a regular comes in. Out comes the same manager from before being the nicest person I've encountered all night, and then come to find out she personally knows the person who was ordering. Proven then by the fact she walked out to flirt and laugh with said gentleman. To add the icing to the cake, while flirting with the gentleman, she was taking orders through her headset and only proceeded to stop when I made it a point of looking at her and taking a photo.   Management and staff, please understand that you're in a field where you have to meet hundreds of different people a day. If you do not have the personality or the need for a job, and want to act like its the worst thing in the world, find another profession. There are many an American that would die for a job, and would probably do it better.  Update: Upon going up to the counter and asking Nick what his full name was, the manager's name and their store number, I was confronted by the manager and the gentleman she was flirting with. The manager just lowered her head and didn't say anything to me after I told her that they all needed to step their service up. I told them I had taken pictures and had her on video that I would love for the store owner to see of her at work with a customer. At this moment her friend storms up to me and starts to yell at me saying that I need to delete my videos and shut my mouth because his dad was a cop and that it wouldn't end well or me. The manager did absolutely NOTHING to stop this gentleman from threatening me and just stayed quiet. I told her friend to back off that this had nothing to do with him and that if he was an employee. The manager finally stepped in and stated he wasn't, to which I replied that she should probably try to control her friend. The gentleman that was trying to get in my face left after I repeatedly ignored him, while trying to ask for basic information on the establishment. All throughout this, Nick was smirking and laughing. I asked him if something was funny and he smiled. I'm going to be writing the owner of this establishment and filing a formal complaint with the BBB, as I believe the franchise holder should be aware of what the employees are doing, while they're being paid."}
{"text":"Never had a problem at this one until today. Guess they were to busy to care about the quality of their food. I ordered my regular Asiago ranch spicy chicken sandwich. Got my food at the window I always do a quality check no matter what, looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it, last time I checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things. So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it. Wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude. I'm still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at. And I expect to get what I ask for with my money. Not something you just feel like free styling."}
{"text":"The last three times I have eaten a sandwich from this location, I have gotten a bad stomach ache.   I think something is off with the condiments, because both a chicken sandwich and a JBC made me sick.  I drank bottled water each visit and did not have any fries or other sides, but my sandwiches all included lettuce, tomato and mayo.  I can't eat here any more if it is going to make me sick."}
{"text":"With $1.00, I can either get 4 gum balls from the gum ball machine at the mall, or choose an item from the plethora found on Wendy's value menu.  I rarely choose the gum balls.  I give Wendy's 5 stars because in my opinion it is everything you could ask for in a fast food joint: Value, friendliness, and most importantly, speed.  I like to play a game called 'How many seconds from the time I finish placing my order until the time I have my order in hand and am driving away?'.  Today it was 24 seconds - now that's fast food!  They are so quick when taking the order, charging at the first window, and delivering your food to you at the second.  And that was around the time of the lunch hour rush.  My favorite game, however, is called 'Don't come to a complete stop when picking up my food'.  Since they usually have my order hanging out the window before I even get there, I can just roll right through, grab my food while still in motion, and be on my way (With a \"Thank you\" of course).  This location usually has hot girls working there too.  Did I mention that the girls at both windows said \"have a good day!\"?.  Well now I did.  In fact, the second one even asked me how I was doing, and while I know their bosses tell them to say those things, my friends at Wendy's almost always sound more genuine than at other places. Many times I get the mandarin chicken salad, which is amazing, but today I got a jr bacon cheeseburger, a crispy chicken sandwich, and a frosty.   I never expect gourmet from Wendy's, especially from the dollar menu, but it's good food and definitely worth it, especially the decadent frosty.  The only complaint I would have is that the first-window girl was not hot like the second-window girl."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for an eternity. Literally waited 25 mins. I ordered the special chicken sandwich they were featuring, some type of chipotle chicken sandwich. I was digging in finally got my sandwich it was tasty but all the sudden I'm eating it and I bite and i couldn't bite through. I thought maybe the lettuce was just tough it was dark out. When I turned on the lights I see a piece of paper connected to my cheese. They had left the cheese paper on my cheese when they made my sandwich. Disgusted at this point. You lost a Wendy's customer for life. Also the fries were cold. This Wendy's blows never stop here."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food place because of the variety of salads. My favorite is the summer berry salad which is seasonal. They recently added a Greek Salad to the menu I haven't tried yet. I came here with a friend and had a lot of coupons. The manager was nice and accepted all of them. If you keep your receipt, on the back is a customer service survey that you can save $2 on a sandwich or salad upon completion. That's pretty nice if you have the time for that:) I don't eat fast food too often but Wendy's is better than Burger King or McDonald's in my opinion. Mickey D's has wimpy salads.. haha. I got a Swiss mini burger wrapped in lettuce with no bun, a pecan apple salad with grilled chicken and sparkling water. Wendy's on rockside took down their waiting in line fence and now has a fill it yourself soda machine to speedy up the service, some very nice changes :)"}
{"text":"Mom loves the salads here, and today, I don't know why, but the \"natural-cut fries\" called out to me.  I've never ordered these here before.  Oh, now I remember why-- because the words \"Natural-cut fries\" were followed by \"with sea salt.\"  My body must've been craving for salt, because these were oh-so-delicious.  Loved the crunchy texture, as well!  I detected a peanut-y flavor, so I wonder if peanut oil was used?  I thank the Lord that I only had the chance to eat about a little under a fifth of the large serving while driving before I decided to wait until I had safely parked and transferred all of the groceries from the car into my home.  By the time I turned my attention to the fries, they were now soggy and inedible (to me).  Have I ever told you how I hate soggy, floppy things?  No?  Well, I do.  Fries, pizza, sweet potato fries... --- UPDATE   5/17/15  Mom said the last three times she's had salad from here, the chicken was very salty, so no more of Wendy's salads!  #760"}
{"text":"every time i go for a frosty they are always melted. might as well go home and make chocolate milk!"}
{"text":"The Service was so slow, but I told myself at least my food would be fresh and hot! Not so... The french fries were cold and limp. The hamburger was cold and did not even taste like a Wendy's hamburger. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Fast food reviews are always rough but they built their success on delivering a consistent product. That is the main problem with this location. And service cam be iffy. When it's good they should be proud but unfortunately is not consistent. They will always be my favorite because it was my first job and everything is fresh everyday. But consistency is key and this is the only one in the area."}
{"text":"Location, location, location.  It is the only one in the area.   I am a Wendy's lover but they are becoming service inconsistent.  When it is good, it is really good. But unfortunately the fries are almost always old, the burger is warm and it takes to long to get the food through the drive through."}
{"text":"My sandwich was so overcooked that I could barely get my teeth through it. The bun was black and the chicken was dark brown and very hard. I was only able to get one bite down so that's how many stars I'll give it."}
{"text":"This Wendys is a joke, Unfortunately it is not the funny ha-ha kind, but the ironic sarcastic kind.  I stopped at this location just 5 minutes ago.  Went through drive through.  I always order the same thing, breakfast mornin' melt Panini, bacon.  No combo this time.  3 of 5 times, including today, I've gotten sausage instead of bacon.  It's annoying this time because they even asked me at the pay window to confirm bacon.  Big ol' piece of nasty sausage instead.  They also removed the Tomato this time which I enjoy.  This location was redone, however it's still kind of dingy.  They have the coke freestyle machine but you might as well not go there for that - many of the flavors either will run out on you mid-drink, or not be available because it isn't monitored/refilled like it should be.  I used to visit this location frequently, but there's another (better/fresher) sub shop that opened up just down the road - Mad City Sandwiches.  My coworkers and I go to this location instead of Wendys now.  This particular location is a literal joke at my place of employment - Going to Wendys?  Make sure to have an extra 15 minutes and to check, check, check your food!  I've complained to Corporate before about the lack of accuracy of the food, this has been a consistent issue for the last 3 years I've been going to the location.  Not a word back from Wendy's.  Footnote: They don't care, do not expect them to change.  The same people have been working here for a long time, and they may have gutted the exterior and interior, but until they gut some of the employees out this location simply will not change.  I would suggest a change in upper management of this location - Staff reflects leadership, and the leadership is poor.  As far as people saying they've gotten sick from the food - I haven't gotten sick personally, but my job is very close to this location.  I've seen co-workers get sick from eating there.  But you have to have a bit of a iron-gut for Wendys.  Let's face it - we all know the hamburgers are so pre-processed and actually proven to be /bad/ for you (like McDonalds).  If you are used to eating lighter fare, salads, and the like - prepare to spend quality time with the toilet."}
{"text":"I drive out of my way to avoid this Wendys.  There is one next to my house.  I stopped by Store #5152 in Madison, WI and John was Awful.  This store has been bad in the past, and I've complained and never been responded to even!  My fiancée and I tried to walk in at 9:40 to get some take out.  He saw us walking up and locked the door.  We went through the drive Thru and asked when the inside closed, we were told by John at 10, and it was about that time now so he guessed the drive thru was our only option.  We received our food immediately and our chicken nuggets were eaten right away, and cold.  One order was almost luke-warm, the other cold.  So I can say maybe the $4 combo is good when fresh, but don't bother if you don't trust the Wendys.  It would have been nice to see the special, but half the lighting was not functional on the drive-thru.  There are plenty of other fast-food options where the food is kept fresh and don't cut corners like closing early to avoid waiting on people.  John was very short, and snippy with answers and questions.  I highly recommend not visiting Wendys, especially in Madison WI and going to one of the competitors.  McDonalds has a whole staff that works diligently to keep the food fresh at least.  I remembered after this experience why I drove out of my way to avoid this store.  For confirmation my recpeit number is #3342"}
{"text":"Horrible! Worst Wendy's in Henderson! Go somewhere else! The rude staff neglected to tell me they were out of brioche buns and forgot the bacon on my husbands burger. When they gave me my food at the window, no smile, no hello, no here's your order, no thank you. Just a sour puss faced teenager not uttering a single word, sticking her arm out making zero eye contact. When I got home and unwrapped my crappy and wrong burgers, I was pissed, so I called and spoke to the manager. He, in a not very remorseful or apologetic tone, offered to replace my meal the next time I came in. Great, right? Wrong. When I came in a week later, I asked for the manager I talked to and he came over with an already stank face. He took my order, didn't charge me, didn't apologize, and went back to chatting up the obviously younger than him teens in the kitchen. To top it off, while I was waiting for my food, a group of employees were hanging out in the back, eating in plain sight in the kitchen, when one must have dared the other to eat something gross. One of the female employees started yelling at another loudly, \"Hey look, look!! Oh no! Don't do it! Eww!! Eww!! Eww!! He ate it!! Gross!!\" ...... Not something you want to hear from people in charge of preparing your food. NEVER AGAIN!!! A shame too, it's on my way home from work."}

{"text":"This location is ok. I go to this one because the next closest one is by the mall and it's hard to get in and out of that place. It seems like this place the drive through lines are always long so it's best to go inside. Every drive through order I have made here something is missing! Fries, a sammich, nugz. They also never seem to give enough napkins. The food when you do get it is always hot so that's a good thing. Now when you go inside and order you get the best service! The staff is friendly and food is never missing and is perfect. So it really is best to go inside. Less of a wait as well compared to the drive through. The inside is always clean. Tables are never sticky either. The counters are clean and wiped down. Their bathroom are clean as well. I don't use public restrooms much but when I did have to use this one it was very clean! Was impressed. I will probably fight the mall crowd and go to the other location. They don't seem to mess up drive through orders."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch. Probably another dozen folks inside. Was placing our orders within 3 minutes of walking in the door. Waited for another five after our order was received and paid for before getting our food. My \"Host\" was Larry. Larry had a great personality and was very professional. The food was cooked to order and nothing was cold. The restaurant was pretty clean however, there were a few tables that had some food residue left behind. Plenty of parking nearby if the lot was full. No complaints."}
{"text":"OK, I had a taste for a burger, a double stack 2/25/15, got home and had single with cheese, i called store with issue, manager i guess, placed my name on log, went back on 2/27/15; told cashier hold onions with lettuce/tomato, checked burger, had onion no lettuce/tomato, went back and stated issue and the manager said in an not so nice voice, YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME!!, OK, i know its in a diverse area, but still show common courtesy."}
{"text":"This location is a bit old and run down. They staff are friendly but a little forgetful during the lunch rush. If you go in to order, there is plenty of seating with a nice sunroof covering almost half of the restaurant.  If you chose to go through drive thru, they are tad bit slow, but still a pretty good experience overall.    Parking here is pretty tight."}
{"text":"Idk why I kept coming here but seriously fuck this store. We are done. I am over you."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 days in a row, ordering at 2 different times of day. Twice now, it has taken 5-10 minutes just to ORDER, nevermind paying and getting my food. The staff are unprofessional, rude, and inattentive. They don't seem to understand how to speak to customers. But, I have had two ladies at the window who were perfectly nice."}
{"text":"The burgers here taste like they do at any other Wendys. You either like Wendys or you don't. Some of the past reviewers say it's hit and miss. I personally haven't experienced a miss. But if it's hit and miss that's just like any other fast food restaurant. Fast food restaurants set standards to what the food should taste like and customer service standards as well. It's up to the staff to uphold those standards.   Most of the time I've only been through the drive-thru. I've only gone inside to eat lunch once. The order tasted great as usual. The only thing I can remember was the person at the register didn't seem too friendly. I wasn't greeted and it took about 3 minutes for him to say, \"I can help you over here sir.\"  There's been a few times where I don't even get the proper greeting at the drive-thru either. I pull-up and all I hear is, \"what can I get you?\" To me that just worries me of what's to come. If they don't care about the Wendy's standards enough to simply say, \"Thank for choosing Wendy's...\" or something along those lines, then what makes me believe they're going to care about the standards of my food.  Despite these flaws of this location I haven't had a miss on the quality of my food. Wendy's should really re-train the staff at this location as my patience is wearing thin."}
{"text":"I use to work here and it's disgusting! The lemonade y'all love comes from tap water that isn't even filtered, those chili beans that you nasty asses love is old burger meat rinsed off in the sink and cut up then mixed with sink water and frozen beans. The fries are hardly fresh we just dump them in the fryer again lol. Also we loved over filling the drinks with ice and then putting the drink in so that way when a rude fat ass customer on drive thru come in they'd run out of soda!"}
{"text":"Was here for about an hour with my granddaughter and then went to the drive thru on the way out for wife. Double stack burger was cold so were the fries. No diet caffeine free coke in the drink machine.   Dining room was really empty.  Shame they just redid this one and it has not improved.   When I came here before they had a military discount at check out and when I went to the drive thru they said they didn't . Shame don't care how much it is it's the fact the workers don't even care when they tell you NO.   Sad ....."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend come here almost everyday and for the most part, they either mess up our order or provide very poor customer service. Often times they can't hear you through drive thru and they just say \"what?\"  very blankly and rude instead of saying \"sorry, I didn't hear you.\" If minimum wage is rising I expect for these workers to provide the best service they can and they usually don't. Sorry to say but, they need to get their sh*t together."}
{"text":"Food was good as usual.  But they gave me no napkins.  Big strike.   I want through  drive-thru. Didn't  notice  until  down the road"}
{"text":"First time ever at Wendys. Last minute lunch run and I agreed to drive to Wendys. The line was long at the drive thru but they were pretty quick and their service was awesome! So close to work, I will return ... really enjoyed their food!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit, eat and watch sports!"}
{"text":"Rather empty but i like their food & The frostys  and The barbecue salad at least they have coke Zero"}
{"text":"my favorite is the single cheeseburger with fries & chocolate frosty it's located in the Boca  park shopping center stop by on your way for lunch you'll enjoy it"}
{"text":"went through the drive thru and the girl at the window was so rude, didn't tell me my total, snatched my card, and when handing me anything she wouldn't reach more than 2 inches to where i physically had to open my car door twice to get my items. she didn't say anything the whole time, if you're so miserable with your job find a new one. food was luke warm and old, never wondered if my fries had been purposely dropped on the floor until today."}
{"text":"They must have mistakenly put the chilled chicken for the grilled chicken salad into my sandwich and the fries were room temperature at best in one of the two meals! The good is that the service was friendly and I like the new options that stay up with the trend of hipster food offerings such as brioche buns and pretzel buns and also I like that there is an option for supposed \"fresh lemonade\" as well as salad options."}
{"text":"I'm a calm person but after trying to eat that thing they call a chicken sandwich, I want to go back and cuss everyone out. The sandwich looks like someone sat on it. The chicken is dry AF. I didn't get a damn tomato. Back to the banned list you go. I never thought a chicken sandwich could get messed up. I was wrong. How in the hell is the line always long when the food is trash?"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Wendy's I have been to in a while.  The people working here are friendly enough but they just can't keep up with demand.  There has to be something they aren't doing that other Wendy's manage to get done quickly."}
{"text":"How hard is it to a follow a person's request I'd like 2 bacon cheeseburgers with extra onions on it what do you get a bacon cheeseburger with one little teenie onion on it"}
{"text":"Why are they lucky enough to get 2 stars? Their food is usually ok. It's their service that is HORRIBLE!!! Every time I order any sort of food item they make you pull up and wait even if there is no one behind you in line....why?!? Ill tell you why! They are being timed. I know it is FAST food but don't you want your customers to be happy rather then worry about a timer? I especially love when they give food to the car that was behind me and asked to pull forward, first. I'm pretty sure it isn't rocket science to make a junior bacon....   Their wild berry lemonade is to die for! Don't get it too late at night or else it will be watered down.   They didn't have chocolate frosty so hubby tried a chocolate frosty shake. First, it was gross. Second he found 2 pieces of plastic in it while drinking it. I tried the caramel frosty once again GROSS I love caramel but they used way too much."}
{"text":"Just was threatened with physical violence by the Night manager Alvin at this location when I told him he needed to learn some customer service skills. I hope corporate and the general manager see this, oh i also had my son in the car and have Video proof!!!!!"}
{"text":"super bad service, i came from california on vacation here and i went to the drive thru got two burgers well done and they handed me my food fast like it wasnt well done, i asked before getting the bag if it was well done the manager said yes, she was a hispanic lady who was very rude. i then opened my burgers checked them and the cheese was cold so i knew the burgers werent well done! i was lied to by the manager her self! wow , i told her they arent well done and she calls me a lier that she checked them!!!! this manager should be fired she knows nothing on customer service and was a bad leader doing all this in front of her cashier! she then told cashier give her her $ so she can go ! corp needs to put a stop to this asap ill  ever come here again"}
{"text":"Pull up to the drive through at 10:20 doesn't close till 11. I asked for a frosty and they said \"sorry we already started cleaning our frosty machine because we close soon...\" I ordered 5 burgers and 6 nuggets and they gave me one cup of ranch....! I totally understand that it's a Sunday night and these employees want to be at home but they probably should have chose a better career path lol. Go back to school so you can get a job that doesn't consist of flipping burgers with very poor customer service skills."}
{"text":"Amidst the desert of smoke shops, artsy gift shop(pe?)s, East Asian/Indian/Tofu/Coffee fusion houses, hat shops, bars, and hipster clothing boutiques... there stands an oasis, friends.  It can be grueling, crawling through all those smaller businesses with unique visions and wide eyes. As you stroll along the uniquely named businesses and the earbud-laden millenials, you may feel the world shrink around you. What are these things? Who are these people? Sometimes you just want to be reminded that corporate conglomerates work. That capitalism at its most craven still works. And make no mistake, a frozen square burger is capitalism at its most craven. You know what? It does kinda work.  Don't get me wrong. The food is not good. The employees are not excited. Nothing positive or uplifting or worthwhile is happening here. The menu is the same limited nonsense that every \"classic\" burger joint has. The food is prepared quickly and thrown at you in a grease-stained bag. But, as you stroll down one of the more unique streets in the country, can you get the same frosty and fries that you can also get in Topeka, KS? Yes, you sure can. The system works! Does it taste passable? I guess!  So let them have their bubble tea! Let them have their stupid frothed lattes! Let them have their mediterranean omelette situation! Let them have some stupid sandwich with \"pesto\" on it, whatever that is! You and I, pal, we will have a plain old square burger. We will stare misty-eyed at our Norman Rockwell calendar. We will receive our grease-stained bag and sigh wistfully because it feels like home. We will have muttered reservations about \"those people,\" whoever they may be. We will swear we are happy with the familiar, but in the back of our minds that tingle will always exist: we will know that we deserve better.  Wendy's: you deserve better."}
{"text":"This is definitely the nicest Wendy's ever ! flat screen tv , check, leather seating check, fireplace  check... what a nice ambiance for a fast food joint!"}
{"text":"Asked for the Portabella Brioche burger... No mushrooms, so instead I got a number 1. Ketchup out in the lobby... So I let the girl on register know. She lazily said (without looking at me) \"there are packets there\" and points at a little basket. Then I ask for ranch. They were ALSO out of ranch. But I guess it's ok because my fries weren't burnt. Close this store and take inventory because you don't have a lot."}
{"text":"The lady at the drive thru was taking my order then told me to hold on and came back 2 minutes later to finish taking my order. When I got to the window to pay, she only got down half of my order? My husband wanted onions in his chili, but they weren't chopped. His chili and both of our burgers were cold. Not only that, the employees working tonight were rude. The guy said \"here\" and shoved the bags out the window. Love Wendy's, but I was disappointed with the customer service tonight."}
{"text":"I don't need to, or honestly really feel like, going into all that much detail about Wendy's. Like, most of you have probably been there. It seems about as consistent or inconsistent as any Wendy's. As clean or un-clean as any other Wendy's. I dunno, it's just your run of the mill Wendy's. Never had any problems that I can remember. It's my favorite of the fast food burger chains, so I come here a decent amount.   My review is based mostly on the awesome workers in the drive-thru window. I had my dogs with me and they were being their normal selves, sticking their heads out the window, hamming it up, you know, what dogs do, being awesome I guess you could call it. The girls working were so excited to see them and even asked if it would be okay if they gave each dog a chicken nugget. Awesome customer service!  So I asked each dog to rate the chicken nugget they got to eat. They both thought the nugget was 100 stars out of a possible 5. My labradoodle Franklin said it's best (and to be fair, only)restaurant he's ever eaten at. Finley the golden-doodle was too busy drooling and looking out the window for more free food from his new best friends. He wasn't much help with my Yelp.    My junior bacon cheeseburger and frosty was pretty good too...."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The manager was really friendly and so was the drive-through person taking my order. The food was great! It would've gotten five stars except the drive-through guy that gave me the food seemed new and he forgot to put a straw in my bag. I only noticed it after I drove away."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst fcking Wendy's I have ever been to. They piss me off every time. They always gets orders wrong. Food is not fresh and hot. I would not go there for months and the service is terrible every time. The staff do not greet customers. They do not keep the dining room clean. They frequently run out of condiments and or napkins for the dining area. I would have to say I have received the worst service from there consistently. They just revamped the interior but the service and employees are still terrible."}
{"text":"Honestly would give a 0 if I could. Went through drive through and person at the window was rude as hell. She got my order wrong and forgot to give me stuff I paid for and I had to ask twice and still got some of the wrong things."}
{"text":"this is my favorite wendy's ever highly recommended and its has great workers and better food"}
{"text":"Get order wrong half the time but I like their potatoes"}
{"text":"Asked for no ketchup for kids meal burger 2x at drive through, and they failed.  Nobody answers the phone when I called to complain. Epic failure."}
{"text":"Whenever I get my food- it's cold! I don't know why I ever go there?! I keep hoping it'll turn around- like the others. This is expressly a Frosties Only location for me."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been craving Wendy's for a long time because we moved to an area where they don't have it. On this trip to Vegas, we figured we wanted to eat here because we haven't had it in so long. Needless to say, the food was ok but the service sucked. The lady kept rushing me to order, I wasn't done ordering and she kept telling me my total. I won't be back to this location but then again all the other locations have the same sad reviews."}
{"text":"Whenever I am looking for fast food I hope there is a Wendy's near by. Great quality and selection."}
{"text":"What can I say, I just love the quality at Wendy's and always have a great experience."}
{"text":"Yes, I visited two Wendy's restaurants yesterday. But I only ate at one -- this one.  My food was okay (grilled chicken sandwich, fries, drink) but I had to request hot fries after I tasted mine.  Surfaces (order counter and table where I sat) showed marks from having been wiped but not dried; thankfully there was no odor.  I had to wipe my seat out before I sat down as there was a small bit of something sticky.  I would have just changed seats except I needed to sit where there was a bench and it was the only one available near the front and facing forward. (I wanted to make sure my fries arrived safely...)"}
{"text":"Lousy customer service, rude employees being trained by an extremely unprofessional frumpy dud named Steve.  Can't handle the heat, get out of the kitchen.  And you guys want $15/hr."}
{"text":"I have given them chance after chance, the only reason I return is because my wife and kids don't seem to mind the cold food that they serve here.     At Breakfast time I have attempted to order the sausage burritos. In return I get an item that is nearly room temperature. The cheese has not even melted by the time I get it.  I experienced this at least  on the last 3 occasions.    At lunch I ordered a simple #1 meal.  I received a cold burger. I took it back to the register, where they did apologize. But in return I got another burger at the same room  temperature. What gives? I would have been happy if they would have just nuked the first one for a few seconds. Burned yet again.  The staff don't look like they want to provide any customer service, let alone exceptional customer service. I will be avoiding this location from now on."}
{"text":"I try to reserve fast food outings for road trips but today I left my lunch at home and was coming back up the freeway from an errand in Fort Mill. I was starving and caved to the idea of a nice, juicy hamburger.   I turned into the parking lot and was almost taken out by a Kia who must have been more 'hangry' than I was. He got the spot in front of me in the drive through. Good for him. But it was fine since the line moved very quickly and I ordered a number 2 without onion or pickle. I am normally a beef, cheese and tomato kinda gal but today I was feeling deserving of the extra calories provided by condiments. If you are cheating, go all out right? To that point I seriously debated getting a salad as my side instead of fries. Of course the craving for salty fried deliciousness won out in the end but I like that Wendy's provides the option for a side salad if you want to pretend to be healthy with your combo.   The attendant patiently waited for me to use this opportunity to dig out correct change. This was a great sign I thought for a fast food joint since it was coming up on noon and I went straight from ordering to paying without waiting behind anyone else.  The food came out fresh and quickly. I do believe Wendy's in generally is a cut about their typical competition with the quality of meat they use. This place was exactly what you would want in a fast food burger, quick, delicious and the correct order."}
{"text":"Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad from the drive through. One dressing packet, which isn't really enough for a full size salad, should be one for a half size and two for full. More importantly, no croutons! Thanks for nothing except taking my money. Is this job really that hard?"}
{"text":"They got my order completely correct and gave me exactly what I was requesting. And it was simply through the drive-thru."}
{"text":"The service is delightful and the chicken nuggets were cooked to perfection with a kiss of a stand-alone barbecue sauce that is blue-ribbon. Well done you beautiful ginger lass!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I've ever been too.  Went in over a year ago for breakfast special.  Waited in line for 20 minutes and then the order was all messed up.  Long and short.  Too many other good places out there.  Don't waste your time.."}
{"text":"Has to be the slowest drive thru restaurant I have ever been in in my entire life. My guess is it's because of all the college students that are around here to eat late but still this is insane. Do yourself a favor avoid this place in the late hours and go to cookout he will give you a much better service and faster service."}
{"text":"It was 11:30 a.m. on Monday, July 4th, 2016. I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before boarding my plane. I didn't want anything to pricey or fancy. As always, Wendy's is my #1 TO-GO option. The staff here was really professional and kind. The food was fresh and delicious. Two thumbs up! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"WORST Wendy's ever!! Tonight the drive thru line was incredibly slow, my order was messed up and Lady missed a few items. Like what were you doing the whole time? I'm left to assume she was the only employee working. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very misleading and, therefore, dishonest!  When you order your combo they ask you whether you want medium or lg.  If you don't go there often you are not aware the prices they show is for the small size.  Since they don't ask you to choose from the 3 sizes, I figured they only had the 2 sizes.  Fortunately, I did check the math and asked about the discrepancy.  The clerk reported that they are told to only ask about medium or large since the one on the menu is the small one??????? If they were honest they would ask if you want to upgrade to med. or large.  Very dishonest!"}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting worse every time I visit. From issues with the Drive Thru to issues with employees and managers not caring in store... this is by far the worst Wendy's in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Well I've never been to this location never knew it was there. The staff are very friendly, did get order wrong but fixed it quickly. Tables were hit and miss some clean all the big tables dirty. But being at a truck station I expected worse"}
{"text":"There's quite a lot of parking, so I decided to go inside instead of drive thru. It's for the most part clean, but on a few of their signs some letters were missing. It wasn't busy, i wasn't really greeted warmly, but i just wanted them to get my order right. I got drinks and there are SO many to choose from with the soda dispensers (two). Unfortunately the fries are stale or maybe fried twice? Because the Wendy's on Pima and Chaparral are always perfect. I asked for extra onion on my cheeseburger so I suppose that's what took so long. Overall it was good."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is located in a pretty large brick building with an odd, teal roof, to match the strip of stores behind it.  This general plaza area is always packed with business people escaping their office from the nearby corporate buildings.  It's a bit too crowded during lunch, but the staff handles it pretty well, and they're always very attentive to my refill needs.  Additionally they'll walk around and offer mints, and will take your order while you're waiting in line by hand so that when you get to the register its all ready to go.  Top notch customer service as far as fast food restaurants go!"}
{"text":"I grade fast food places on 3 things usually.... How clean they are, how they execute my order, and how quickly they do it because lets be honest, if i wanted to wait 20 minutes for my cheeseburger i wouldn't be coming to a fast food joint.   This place was clean, i came in just after 11am and tables looked clean and floors and stations were tidy... From what i could see of the kitchen it looked clean as well. I placed my order, the receipt showed all the correct adjustments and when i got home all the correct adjustments were executed. My only complaint was while my french fries were hot, my nuggets were a bit on the cold side...My sandwich was also a decent temperature.  I ordered, had my food and was out the door in less then 7 minutes. I consider that pretty fast for having to make my food since i ordered some changes to sandwich that would of been sitting on the warmer. Solid Wendy's in my opinion."}
{"text":"Never thought I would give Wendy's four stars, but this location deserves it....why.....because its the only decent food option near by!!! I walked to two different gate areas and the only food options were either sit down (which I don't have time for) or outrageously expensive. At Wendy's I got their spicy chicken sandwich for around $4.25, while the place next to them had the same chicken sandwich for $8.50. I ain't made out of money so of course I chose Wendy's!  The service was prompt and I waited about 5 minutes for my sandwich to come. The sandwich was hot, the chicken perfectly fried and the bun nice and soft without being soggy....all things I appreciate! I was pleasantly surprised at how good the sandwich tasted....or maybe I was just super hungry after a long flight, either way, I appreciated food that was hot, tasted good and didn't cost me an arm and a leg.   Wendy's doesn't have an area to sit down, but there are plenty of chairs right across from it.   My biggest gripe about airport food is that it tastes terrible, clogs my arteries and costs a fortune! Besides the artery clogging I can't complain about the other two with Wendy's. So if you're running to your flight and don't want to waste $$$ on bad food, try this Wendy's!"}
{"text":"I went to complain on their site that is listed on the bag but it didn't work! Visited this Wendy's this week and was treated rudely by the woman taking to orders at the drive through window. She needs to listen to the customers orders instead of making up an order. When I corrected her with the order I had given she got an bad attitude and was rude and dismissive to me. Some training is definitely needed at this location."}
{"text":"Food was fast, good, and hot. Service was friendly. Just the same struggle with any fast food restaurant, keeping up with cleaning the tables."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness it's frustrating to enter, park, and exit this Wendy's without making an illegal turn.  I would try to go to this place during my trip to Carowinds and the only way I could safely enter was by making an illegal U-Turn at the Carowinds exit. I tried doing it lawfully by making 3 left turns but got stuck in the mess of a hotel parking lot chock full of one-way streets.  Once you get to here, it's very crowded, and you will frequently find yourself accidentally boxing in parked cars as you try to wait for the drive-thru.  That being said, once you get your food, you will find that it's the same Wendy's food that you get at other stores, except slightly more rushed looking due to the crazy influx of tourists from Carowinds.  It's not a big deal to me, and FAR better than paying $10 for a tiny meal at Carowinds. Getting a burger and chili really hit the spot on our trip to Carowinds and I would gladly do the same again. The only reason this place gets 3-stars rather than 4 is just because of its wait time, and it's poorly designed parking lot."}
{"text":"Overview: This Wendy's is nestled in Charlotte Airport's Concourse A, and is impossible to miss thanks to its location next to a gigantic photo of a woman eating Wendy's fries.  The Service: More tired and disgruntled than their non-airport counterparts due to very, very early hours.  The Establishment: There is a small collection of tables directly next to this Wendy's that can seat probably a dozen people. It's usually open and I have never had trouble finding a place to sit.  The Food: Everything here is prepared with more haste than its out-of-airport version, even when there is no line. Chili containers only 3/4 full, breakfast burritos (pictured below) look like tiny bean bags, etc. Also, the menu appears truncated and doesn't include value-items or specialty items like like Frosties (if my memory serves me correctly.) If need more detail on how it tastes, the breakfast burrito is mushy, and one-dimensional. The chili is overly salty, and all the meat appears to have been burned at one point. Chicken sandwiches are dry and also flavorless. Veggies are skimpy. Bread is... white.  Conclusions: This airport Wendy's is unfortunately a fairly mediocre fast food restaurant that I regrettably eat at often due to the lack of selection in Concourse A."}
{"text":"Update: We visited this location again to (attempt to) satisfy a late night Frosty craving. It was midnight on Saturday night, again they advertise that they close at 3 am. Guess what? Frosty machine has been shut down already! Same employee as last time of course, we just pulled out of line this time and didn't feel like dealing with it."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service. Takes forever for them to help customers who choose to get their food inside. The female manager with red hair is rude and lazy. She and several of her crew were sitting together even before the dining area was closed. Unprofessional. I'm giving two stars because the food was the only reason I came back, but not anymore."}
{"text":"A couple blocks away from the UPMC Shadyside hospital, this was one of the better Wendy's experiences I have had.  Friendly staff working at a fast clip at the inside counter.   I got a spicy chicken medium combo with small chili and sweet tea. I also picked up the $1 frosty keychain tag of which 0.80 goes to the Salvation Army and gets me a free mini-frosty with subsequent visits.  They didn't try to upsell me or read me the rule book when I asked for extra hot chili sauce (my favorite hot sauce of any fast food chain) and crackers like the Wendy's at home.  Food was fresh and hot. Can't ask for more from a Wendy's."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to the beef at Wendy's, BUT I have been to this location and the fish hatchery location and the newer thicker beef patties have a strange old meat flavor. Not sure when or if I will go back. This used to be a favorite. Very disappointed. I wish they would go back to the old style of burgers."}
{"text":"The service here absolutely  sucks. No smiles, no thank you, it's as though they are doing you a favor by serving you at all. Dave Thomas is rolling over in his grave. This is nothing new. This has always been my least favorite Wendy's. Try it for yourself and write it up if you fare better."}
{"text":"Got to have my frosteeeee Frosty, this one a half and half:  chocolate and vanilla.  Not so much a swirl, but a mix, in the tall cup.  The famous Frosty dessert, trade-marked and found exclusively at Wendy's, is a welcome sweet comforting treat, when trapped in this terminal of McCarran, waiting what seems like eternity for your extremely late flight.  Then again, had it not been for the delay, I might not have wandered around and spotted the freckled red-headed burger girl sign.  Anyway, the Frosty could very well be the only edible thing in an airport that isn't outrageously priced.  At just a few bucks, who can complain?  Had I bought one of the square burgers, which I have not eaten in decades, this rating might be different, so that is the disclaimer on this review.  But the frozen-ish creamy confection was perfect.  If you happen to be stuck in Terminal C, you can fetch your own Frosty near Gates 24 and 23.  Wendy's holds down the left corner of a mini-food court, directly to the left of Sammy's (as in, Hagar) Beach bar and grill.  Popeye's Chicken and some pizza and pasta concession comprise the rest of the fast food court."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. This place has the worst customer service, I came tonight ask for the double stack and to add lettuce and tomatoes. The drive thru rep tells me it's such a good deal they won't add anything. Not even for an extra charge. This is not the first time this particular location hasn't honored policies or coupons."}
{"text":"The absolutely worst fast food place in North Scottsdale.   Cashiers with IQs of less than zero but, more importantly, every time you walk in, the place literally smells like sewage.  I go in once in a while for a drink because I'm in the plaza.   At the drive through once, once of the girls pulled the nastiest attitude with me that I drove around, walked into the restaurant to speak to the manager and was told she wasn't there that night.   If I could give MINUS 10 STARS, I would."}
{"text":"They can be a bit slow with their breakfast service here at this Wendy's, but have had no other problems getting their regular items."}
{"text":"Dang, this grilled chicken go wrap is the stuff. What a steal at $1.59. It was a legit chicken breast too not that fake McDonalds junk. Yum!"}
{"text":"I give Wendy's a higher star because there are no Wendy's in the QC, so I have to drive to find one - and Wendy's was my grandmother's favorite burger joint, so I do like it too.   I approached the counter and placed my order with the cashier while images of Ryan C.'s advice on picking up fast food workers for wild passionate times ran through my head. But I refocused and ordered from the dollar menu. A burger, small fries and a medium frosty completed my order.   I have to add the Wendy's Frosty to my list of happy finishes because really, is there anything better, at least at a fast food restaurant than a Frosty? not counting Ryan C.'s comments, that is....but I digress...the cashier asked me 'what flavor?\" - Excuse me? There is only one true flavor of Frosty and that is the original chocolate Frosty. The others are like inbred cousins. Although I am Vanilla Heat, I do not want a vanilla Frosty. I do not want some odd swirl, something with toffee chips or weak attempts at impersonating a Blizzard. Give me the chocolate Frosty...and yes, I do want fries with that. I had not really tried it, but I was thinking of a conversation with my friend a few months ago where she indicating she liked dipping fries in her Frosty. I was daring and gave it a shot. Yes, ladies - I am hip, spontaneous and daring. Call me...to my surprise, it was not bad. I am sure I will stick my fry into the Frosty again in the future. Thanks to my friend for the suggestion..."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Wendy's since the 1990s and its always been just fine, better than the Wendy' I've visiting in NYC and Cincinnati. My order has never been messed up at all, the service is quick and the employees have always been friendly."}
{"text":"Wendy's is Wendy's.... The food is decent. The Frosty's are what I go for! This one in particular stands out because of the updated look and Coke remix machine."}
{"text":"Taco sauce had a September 25 date. Today is October 20. Spoiled my taco salad when I noticed that."}
{"text":"Its a wendys so theres really not much else to say. Some of the staff are gross though. Except for the manager who has the blonde hair. She's fine as hell."}
{"text":"I swear to God I'm being punked. I ordered combo 5 with a lemonade, no ice. What I got was a burger, a ridiculous cup for a small amount of liquid, and no fries. Check out the pic posted. I haven't touched anything. That's exactly what they gave me."}
{"text":"I am not one to post bad reviews of businesses, but management needs to take action. This location was disgusting. The tables were dirty, we went to clean one off ourselves so we could sit down, but the napkins were empty. The workers were behind the counter shooing flies away from their faces and the food. Flies were all over the lobby, both my husband and I lost our appetites and couldn't eat more than a couple bites before leaving. If the lobby looked that bad, I can't even imagine what it's like in the kitchen where we can't see. It smelt like this establishment hadn't been cleaned in months."}
{"text":"NOPE! JUST NO. DONT GO. ,I would go into greater detail beyond the wise guy/rude attitude or the really long wait for no real reason and poor customer service I received but that's just the beginning. Don't go.... only because of the reasons I listed there are enough there for you, I'm currently dealing with the rest...   (yelp needs to active the negative stars side or at least a zero because a one gives this location way too much credit that it does not deserve)  UPDATE: after being seen at UMC I got my test results back and I had food poisoning! I WONDER WHERE THAT COULD HAVE CAME FROM??? I'm not pointing any fingers but THAT WAS THE LAST PLACE I ATE AT so draw your own conclusions..."}
{"text":"Wow.  This seriously can not be the first review for this Wendy's location!?!?  Anyway....Wendy's is your traditional fast food joint.  With square hamburger patties and Frosty's.    They're pretty much all the same.    EXCEPT....I do not like a side of scabs, sores, and blistered fingers and arms with my fries.  Thank you.  Went through the drive-through to grab lunch.  Was hankering for a frosty-fry combination. It's the sweet / salty thing.    I ordered.  Drove up to the first window and paid.  Then drove to the second window to pick up my food.  I did a double take at the guys hands and arms that was manning the second window.  Some sores scabbed over.  Some looked like they were weeping.  But it was a blistered nasty mess.  Like he had his hands shoved in the fryer a week or so prior and they were healing.  VOMIT!!  I was so digusted in fact that I immediately tossed my food away when I got back to work.    Wether he touched my food or not, did not matter.  Just the pure thought of him possibly touching my food was enough to make me toss everything in the trash.   DRY HEAVE!!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 20 mins after ordering 3 frostys and them saying itll be ready. We got up to the window just to be told they already emptied the machine. Never going back thank you(:"}
{"text":"I agree with everyone's reviews.  Even the drive through is slow.  It isn't the greatest location but I do have hopes that they plan to upgrade the location.  There isn't many choices in buckeye for food add it is"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Cashier forgot half my items in the drive thru and my chicken sandwich was on stale bread. Not that I ever expect much from fast food, but this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to give fast food five stars. But it's a relative rating. Compared to other fast food restaurants, this one is the best. Freshest, best assembled food around. Rarely do they forget my stuff, but when they do, they are very nice about fixing their mistake.  All kinds of interesting people working there who actually seem involved in their jobs...not just spaced out passing the time as their body mechanically passes food to you.  The only downside to this place is that I'm getting pretty fat. I know...that's on me, not them."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I had a craving for a chicken sandwich.  However, I forgot it was Sunday and Chick-Fil-A.  Was closed, no biggie.  I went to Wendy's and it was packed. I do admit the staff was working hard and being polite But my wait was still pretty long.  I eventually got my food and it looked depressed  I then took a bite and it was awful. Not even close to be good. It was barely edible. I didnt even finish it.  I don't  recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wendy's probably has one of the best fast food franchise burgers out there. The only issue I have is that their limited burgers are SO delicious that they should be permanent. Like the Jalapeño Fresco chicken, or the Ghost Pepper Chicken, and the mini chipotle burgers. Mmm..."}
{"text":"Always fresh and hot food!!! Great service and price (the toilet was dirty though).   Love the 4 for 4!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Because of my job this place is convenient but very frustrating. I always have to constantly repeat my drive thru order. Usually the person taking my order appears listless and mumbles an incoherent response. Check your order for a straw, plastic utensils or napkins."}
{"text":"This restaurant has such good chicken nuggets and the frosties are to die for! Today I went in with my brother to have lunch and the service was quick and friendly! Food was very delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I love Wendy's!  Not to mention the cashier that took my order was SUCH a sweetheart.  When I want Wendy's, I sometimes go out of my way to come to this one... don't judge me.   :)"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Wendy's. It's seems like it's \"real\" meat that is used, the food is not stale, you have awesome choice of salads for the healthier choice, the chili is yummy.. the only thing that's a bit of a pain is the cash line ups. It's always a mess. There's no definite \"line up\" so people are everywhere; you don't know if your coming or going."}
{"text":"Probably the worst fast food joint on this side of charlotte. I've lived here for over two years and have eaten there a few times and I honestly don't think they have ever gotten my order right. I'm not exaggerating. Today I received 3 different four for fours (that were also short on fries) and that was definitely not what I ordered lol. But seriously, go somewhere else if you don't want someone else's dinner"}
{"text":"They built this new Wendy's and the employees do not even try to keep it clean. Filth!  Even smells dirty."}
{"text":"First off service was horrible! The baconator fries are usually really good but at this one the cheese wasn't even melted all the way, just looked like someone threw shredded cheddar cheese on top. The fries were so stale and cold that my appetite was lost completely."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru on 3/18/17 at about 7:24pm and when we asked the employee to hold on so we could look at the menu, she snapped, saying \"I don't know who you think you're asking to hold on\" after an exchange of words when she was questioned about why she was being so rude we decided to leave and as we left she felt the need to yell out the pick up window and tell us to have a nice day with other customers in the drive thru.  We called the 800 number to let them know of the situation to pass on to upper management and requested a call back from the General Manager. As of today, still no call. Appears that this is why their employees feel they can get away with such behavior.  I was a manager for Wendy's for a number of years and any employee would have received a disciplinary for such actions and the fact that the store never replied to a customer's concern is almost unheard of if the complaint came from the 800 customer service line.  An epic fail all the way around for Wendy's."}
{"text":"Got an apple pecan salad, Kable was the cashier he was pleasant and greeted me as i walked through the door.    Today the dining area was filthy, i don't know how busy it was before i got there but it was not a good look but when i asked Martavious (i hope i spelled it right) for a wet napkin to clean a table he came out and cleaned the whole area.    My boys ordered bacon cheeseburgers with no tomatoes and they both had tomatoes.  It's a good thing that they just don't like them and it's not a food allergy."}
{"text":"Went inside around 6:00 pm.  NOBODY inside restaurant (perhaps because they forgot to turn on the big 'WENDY'S\" sign?).  Stood at counter and nobody came to wait on me.  Left restaurant and went through drive thru.  Food was typical Wendy's.  When ordering, I asked for a fish sandwich and they actually advised me that it would take 5 minutes.  Changed my order and thanked them for the \"heads up\".  Counter service was non-existent, but the drive thru was quick."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is amazing! The only one I've found that I can order my lunch salad, and breakfast both, at 8am! The food is always fresh, and always correct! ZACH made my morning today, he was so kind, and the food was perfect as always! Thank you Wendy's, at Gilbert, and baseline!"}
{"text":"I had really bad customer service tonight. I hate when I'm treated rudely. My husband and I went to order at the drive through but were unsure what we wanted and asked to give us a moment. Right when we were about to order she rudely says \"are you going to order or not\" no one was behind us, it's 10 at night so the dining room is closed. I've worked in customer service and this appalled me. No matter how you feel about the customer you always smile and test with respect. Clearly they need some staff training on customer service. At least I like wendy's food"}
{"text":"I have never waited so long I my life to get food, then when I got to the window the employee was rude when I told them they forgot something will not be going again"}
{"text":"me & my co worker just purchased two 4 for $4 meals from you guys which includes sauce. so when the person asked which sauce for each & we said bbq & ranch, why are there zero sauces in each of our bags?! if i'm gonna be charged for sauce i want the sauce. and yall only gave me 3 nuggets, what the heck! yall suck!"}
{"text":"The manager needs to put in a drink station. Staff is unbelievably slow and getting the drink orders confused. Waiting 20 minutes inside!"}
{"text":"Last night around 9pm I waited in the drive thru for 15-20 mins. All for a frosty. While I was hoping waiting with my window down , a man with an electronic scooter tossed his scooter on the ground to creep up and approach my car. I was taken by surprise. He was begging a dollar. Hell no..my kids don't even have electric scooters and I work. So be careful."}
{"text":"This Wendy's doesn't deserve 1 star but I couldn't give it a 1/2 star. The black coffee was the only thing good on our order. Everything else was cold (50 degrees). All the restaurants at 6am had lines 10 customers deep. Wendy's was the only one that nobody was standing in line. The health department needs to do an inspection."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience we have ever had at a fast food restaurant ever! First we had to wait in the line of the drive thru for over 15 minutes. Then when we got our food it was freezing cold! Also my burger was cooked to death and was so dry it was not consumable the bread was also hard! We also go chicken nuggets and Caesar side salad. The side salad had only about 5 or 6 bites of lettuce in it. The only thing that was okay were the chicken nuggets. I would have thought with how long we were waiting in the drive thru that the food would have been fresh. I will not recommend this Wendy's to anyone ever nor will I go back! I will drive right past it to Matthews or Indian trail."}
{"text":"This location just reopened, and it is shockingly beautiful for a fast-food joint. Giant glass windows give a peek inside to the revamped interior, complete with the fancy-schmancy create-your-own-Coke machine. We got our order to go, and service was super pleasant and expedient, although the dining room closes at 10pm which means that the drive-thru line gets backed up onto Baum come 10:15pm. We'll see if hours adjust based on demand. In the meantime, it's the cleanest place to have \"quick\" food on Baum/Centre!"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever. I've been here three times in the past month and every time they get my order wrong somehow. I don't think the staff or management care about their quality of service!"}
{"text":"Hit the drive thru for lunch today . Ordered the chili  and bake potatoes with bacon and cheese . Asked for extra crackers  they gave me three packs. Come on people so asked for more and  was able to get a few more packs . So I thought all was good . Until I reached my destination to find out they did not give us spoons for the chili.  So now I am so ticked off,  once I was able to locate us some spoons our  food was cold .  So the food was good service was bad ."}
{"text":"Best wendys I have ever visited! Staff are super friendly and this location has recently been renovated so it looks very nice and stylish.   Also I love the freestyle coke machine where you can make any combination you like in drink form. I travel further just for this!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why they eliminated their $2.99 crispy chicken deluxe meal and if I am correct, raised the price on fries in the middle of a recession. I do understand that it has alienated customers, such as myself.   Recently I had been eating here so frequently that I became the duke of this Wendy's. The employees are friendly and the dining area is generally clean.   I have lowered the rating by a star. Eliminating a good deal during a recession lowers my opinion of the place."}
{"text":"When they had the crispy chicken deluxe meal for $2.99, I'd eat here. Recently Wendy's bean counters got greedy and eliminated it. Good move in a recession."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the medium size crispy chicken deluxe extra value. At $3.87 it is a bargain. So, usually when I head north and I am in the Wendy's mood I.ll dine here.  There is plenty of parking. The restaurant is never packed."}
{"text":"Poor service, dirty, and the food quality is not nearly as good as other wendys i have been to."}
{"text":"Your standard Wendy's location. This one has been updated to the ultra-modern look Wendy's has been going for lately. Wendy's is arguably the best at getting all of their restaurants up to speed with modernization. It also gives the feel that food here is better for you.  They of course still have the usual burgers and fries. (In my opinion, some of the best burgers and fries in the fast food industry for an affordable price.) They still have the frosty. It would be shameful to get anything but the chocolate (AKA: original) frosty. But they do have plenty of good salad options and grilled chicken sandwiches to compliment the fried chicken. People swear by their chili and baked potatoes. And the 4 for 4 deal is probably an industry best.  Service here wasn't bad. They're easy access on and off the highway. It's clean and nice inside. The parking lot could use repainting. Food quality is as expected for all Wendy's locations."}
{"text":"Wendy's! Where we all go to get that chocolate frosty fix. You know you do it! We all do it. Just because you're a local business yuppy doesn't mean you don't crave fast food from time to time. But don't touch the vanilla frosties...I'm not sure where Wendy's came up with that disgraceful concoction.  For fast food in general, Wendy's emerges on top of most. Lots of actually delicious salad creations. They're smart about catering to the changing times and dietary demands of the populace. The sandwiches are in good variety and at least actually make you FEEL like you're eating healthy (grilled chicken anybody?). The burger patties are IMO the best to be had on the cheap from a fast food joint. (I say on the cheap because Five Guys is clearly above and beyond this.) They even have some excellent strawberry lemonade.  Last but not least, while most other fast foods have constantly tried to make their chicken nuggets appeal with change, Wendy's has stuck it out. Their nuggets are unbeatable as far as I'm concerned. And whoever came up with the 4 for 4 scheme is a genius of marketing. Makes me crave that and a frosty now just typing this..."}
{"text":"Stop rushing customers while they are ordering in drive thru!!!!!!! I usually don't take long at all. Once I order an item I hear \"ok is that all?\" after each item. It comes off very rude. I understand time is important at fast food restaurants, but this happened to us TOO many times. I called to complain but was not taken seriously, so I decided to review it here on Yelp. Not only do they rush you, but food is continuously missed. It's okay if it happens once in awhile, but literally 1 out of 3 times I go here, they forget something. Usually small things such as nugget sauces, or condiments such as salad dressing or sour cream for potatoes...but that is still quite an inconvenience. Sucks because it is the closest Wendy's to our house. You need to learn how to balance good customer service while managing your time & accuracy of orders! Do not forget your customers! Decent food but bad customer service."}
{"text":"I eat here about 2 times a month and it can be hit or miss. I have had great food and great service and the other times waited 15 minutes in line and had spoiled tea. So it's a 50-50 chance here."}
{"text":"I could give 0 stars I would. It looks 30 minutes to get our order, we had to send it back twice and it still was wrong. And the tomatoes tasted like they were bad. Worst service ever. #NeverAgain"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and its been hit or miss. I usually have no problem, drive thru is pretty fast even during their busy hours. But the last time I went I ordered a combo meal at the drive thru and as I pulled away realized there were no fries in my bag. No biggie but when I went inside to get them, instead of just giving them to me, the girl at the counter called the drive thru girl over and asked her if I got my fries. Working in customer service for many years I found this to be very odd and demeaning in a way. Almost as if she was accusing me of lying without outright saying it. Over an order of french fries mind you. Well when the drive thru girl came over she looked me in the eyes and said \"You know I gave you your fries\" rolled her eyes and walked away before I could respond. The first girl I spoke to then proceeded to help the next person in line without speaking to me again. I honestly couldn't believe it. I mean really?  What kind of customer service is that?  When the cashier finished with the gentlman behind me she gave me an exasperated look of \"what do you want?\" Now I wasn't even mad when they forgot my fries, mistakes happen, but at this point I was reaching my boiling point. So I replied \"Either you give me the fries I paid for or give me both your names and the number to your corporate office...you decide.\" I got yet another eye roll but finally received my fries!  Last time I go here though...too bad because it's the only location near my house."}
{"text":"ran out of fries..filthy..unhelpful dumb staff who couldn't care less.messed up my order and three others. should be shut down and lose franchise.  DO NOT GO"}
{"text":"Dont ask for butter here.they dont know the difference with natural healthy butter over chemical laden margerine nature over factory crap people"}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food, I call Wendy's a favorite! It is quite sad how much this location has gone down hill over the past several years. That is witnessed by the much lower NC Sanitation Rating from the aforementioned previous years. (93 during this visit from 98's and 99's!)  When the old manager, Alan, ran the place - it ran like a well oiled machine and was kept neat as a pin! Now, the place is just dirty and the customer service isn't all that great...  In the past, people would be lined up around the weekday lunch hour waiting to be served and now it rarely seems to be that busy. So, it makes complete sense.  Thankfully our food came out in a reasonable time.  Our company lunch group made this an almost weekly staple and now - not so much!  Frowny face."}
{"text":"Come and check out the new and improved Wendy's new look new vibe. You forget your on Nellis and Washington...  Also, Wendy's corporation can you build a Wendy's near Aliante 216 or  Decatur 215?"}
{"text":"The most terrible service ever, mind you I don't expect much from people who work in this industry. Sat in the drive thru for roughly 10 mins waiting for the lady to do everyone ONE handed. This girl is holding a cup, of ice I'm assuming, to her face the entire time. Totally unfriendly and clearly hates her job, maybe even her life I'm not quite sure.  Go home, why did you even come to work?!"}
{"text":"Rude, terrible service. Feels like they mopped their floor with soda, it's so sticky."}
{"text":"In all the years that I have lived in Charlotte and driven past this location on my way to (or from) the airport, I have never stopped. So one day I did. It is about the same as every other Wendy's location.  They have undergone a bit of a makeover - they aren't completely new like some locations, but they aren't completely old either. Though one thing I like about Wendy's is their menu, which usually sounds more appetizing than most other fast food joints, the one thing I really hate about Wendy's is the way the line works. You get this single line that goes to a single register and a single place for pick up.  There are others that do this too - but do they not understand that there are better ways to handle it and get things moving better?"}
{"text":"This location is a bit odd - unlike the Chick-Fil-A across the parking lot, you can pretty easily miss this place if you aren't looking for it. It isn't that they are hard to get into or anything, it's just that they are not easily noticed and several other restaurants can be found before you notice that Wendy's is even there.  If you should happen to get to Wendy's? Nothing much fancy about it - it is on the newer side when compared to some of the older stores, which is nice. There are a few places around Charlotte that are definitely in need of a makeover, this one is more upscale, so that is nice. Staff is generally friendly too."}
{"text":"Wendy's?  Reviewing Wendy's?  That's right.  Dave Thomas would be proud if he were still with us.  Except there isn't much to be proud of at this location.  I mean it looks nice and all (really, it's a very nice example of what a Wendy's can look like), but it's not so nice other than that.  Service is s... l... o... w.  Even if you're from the south and single syllable words take three or more syllables to pronounce, this place is slow.  The new (ish) menu at Wendy's is a step up from where they used to be, but I am pretty sure that isn't specific to this location.  The only downside is that speed of service.  It is downright painful."}
{"text":"I have to say it like it is.  If I happen to be in the area - and I usually am not - then Wendy's is probably not my first choice, even if I am looking for something fast.  Bojangles or Chick-Fil-A will probably get the nod, and maybe even Jack-in-the-Box.  If I want something better, there are half a dozen other places.  But if I happen to end up at Wendy's, this is not a bad location.  It can be something of a challenge to get into simply because of where it is.  You can really only access it if you are headed down Sharon Amity, and that is the only way you can exit as well.  If you are going in the other direction, or on Randolph at all, you are pretty much out of luck.  That can make things challenging, and somewhat defeats the purpose of fast food, right?  In any case, assume you do get in (and by extension, that you can then get out again), the place is actually fairly clean and the staff is pretty friendly.  It is a bit dated, but the menu is typical for what you would find in a Wendy's.  Nothing special there.  It is not the new style of building, but it works well enough in a pinch."}
{"text":"I don't know why it is, but I've never been a huge fan of Wendy's.  Maybe it's those strange, square burgers.  Whatever the reason, I noticed that this location started serving breakfast, so I decided that I needed to stop in and check it out - I had never had Wendy's breakfast before (as I understand it, they are slowly rolling it out in select locations).  What I found out is that it's okay.  Just like the other burger places, they have a number of selections for breakfast, and the choices are all pretty similar - in other words, it's a fast food breakfast.  Not too much variety here, other than you can get breakfast at Wendy's now."}
{"text":"This was the worst Wendy's I have ever been to. Please don't go to this Wendy's. i've never been so uninvited to a place to eat. The man told me to go to the drive-through if I wanted any food. And that his manager wanted me out of the building. Meanwhile my wife was in the bathroom.  However that did not matter to him."}
{"text":"You never hope for it, but this location burning down really helped it. Nice modern building now."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.  Slow moving, rude staff.  The worst part is that everywhere in the restaurant is absolutely disgusting.  Smells terribly of urine.  I've used concert port a potty's that have been cleaner in regards to the restroom.  The bonus, I've been trying to hold down my taco salad I ate.  I'd put money on that I'm not going to be able to."}
{"text":"Wendy's has improved their quality of late and this location has made it onto our short list of \"fail-safe\" weekend or late night food options.   Speed: Typically faster than most Wendy's locations, with 2 out of 10 times I have to pull forward to wait for my food.  Attention to detail: Beware, this location has an issue with drink cup lids coming off because they didn't press them on and make sure they're on.  Service: Why yes, I want to order fries and apple slices with the kids meal. This location asks more than the rest if I'm sure. Yes I'm sure, I asked for it, I have a debit card in hand, do you not want to take my money? Repeat after me: french fries and a side of apple slices. See, that wasn't so hard now was it?  Cleanliness: When you look in the drive through window the place doesn't look like a shrine to lard like some places do. (Including the Wendy's at Marks and Sunset which just looks icky).  I usually use the drive through, the inside seating area is typically clean but it's also dated and in serious need of a refresh.   Overall 3 Stars: Since we don't have Chick-Fil-A here, if you like a spicy chicken sandwich you make do with what you have."}
{"text":"Ordered a Chicken Asiago sandwich and when i got home i came to find out it did NOT have asiago cheese, bacon or tomato like it's supposed to. This Wendy's suuuuucks!! Super let down, cuz Wendy's is one of the only fast food places I like. DONT GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"Drive thru can sometimes be really slow. I ordered food through the drive thru and when I drove off I realized I didn't get any napkins or silverware for my food. Really hard to eat chili without a spoon."}
{"text":"It's wendy's, but it's good."}
{"text":"The JBCs have gotten more expensive, but the burger has gotten smaller! It doesn't even cover the bun. One piece of bacon. No salt on the fries. Food was room temperature. Only plus was the quick drive-thru service...and that's because the burgers had been sitting there, based on the temperature."}
{"text":"25 minute wait just to order in drive thru. Another 10 minute wait for food. Not acceptable for a fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Decided to give this Wendy's a try since I was driving by and wanting a burger, but not McDonalds.I'm glad I did. There was a line in the drive through, but it moved quickly. I ordered a double cheeseburger and it was hot and not squished in the bag. It tasted pretty good and I would order it again. The lady at the drive through was really friendly and fast too."}
{"text":"This location lies about its hours. Says open until 1am on the door but was clearly closed at 12:20. Fast food is expected to be cheap, reliable and fast. Nothing less reliable than not being there when you're supposed to be. Now I'm starving at work in the middle of the night. Thanks. Next time I'm ordering Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"As busy as they were when I came in. They still managed to give me OLD frys. It was cold and u can taste that they weren't fresh. I had tried calling but no one answered. I was better off staying in and eating a banana"}
{"text":"The worst Wendy's I have ever gone too!! I would not recommend this place. They handed me a frosty with some kind of rubber material in it. Very disgusting I will never go back to this Wendy's location"}
{"text":"Well played, Wolf of Wendy's!!  You knew that it would never occur to drive-thru fodder such as myself to peer beyond that thin veneer of hot fresh fries, didn't you? After all only a maniac would think to suspect that what lurked beneath would be of neither the same consistency nor Calendar Year!!!!!!!!  (Seriously, have I just NOW been  Punk'd?!)  You Sir / M'am are indeed going places! Then again, I just publicly reviewed fast food.  Tl;dr: old rubbery fries"}
{"text":"The best Wendy's I've been to in Pittsburgh. They consistently make good food. The service is average but the food here is near perfect everytime. Spicy chicken sandwich is my main go to but I've had the burgers and they are nice and juicy. I'd say if you're looking for a good fast food place this Wendy's is a great choice."}
{"text":"Came in to eat here today and the experience was good. When we were ordering the manager April came and helped us out and ended up helping us save on our whole order by choosing certain meals instead of getting all the items individually. She was very nice and helpful. Most of the food places I go to don't ever try to help you like this so it made the place stand out to me. Me and my family never eat here and it was our first time so I'm glad to say it was a good experience and we will be returning soon.   The environment was nice and quiet. There was a few people in the lobby but it was still a calm atmosphere and the store is nice and clean. Overall I have nothing negative to say about the place."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since we had Wendy's. Looks like it's going to be even longer before I go back. I paid $45 for cold food, drinks were flat. And was missing food. Very disappointed. Get it together."}
{"text":"Sunday 6pm. Couldn't enjoy my meal without the fly around me. Messy Wendy's where the floor was dirty. I hate having a white salad, you know when they use the crappy part of the lettuce."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Waited in drive-thru for over 20 minutes. Food was cold & tasted old. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Yet again I order the apple pecan chicken salad  & no pecans!  Geez it's the whole reason I order this salad."}
{"text":"Simply not acceptable. I drove through last night and the kid working the drive thru was too busy \"rapping\" about his \"hustle\" to a.) get my order right, and b.) give me my change. The Frosty I ordered was completely melted and might as well have been a lukewarm chocolate milk. This is quite possibly the worst Wendy's location in the area, the service here is consistently awful."}
{"text":"Food was nice and hot. Location was clean. If you can enjoy your meal while the employees behind the counter are using foul language and ignoring the people at the counter this is a great place."}
{"text":"Me and my friend ordered 32 dollars worth of food . I know it's a lot of stuff but we asked is everything here , If not you guys will get a bad yelp review . Well minus 20 chicken nuggets later here we are (angry emoji and all )The kid looked like a Bryan . So if you see a Bryan tell him not to forget the chicken nuggs ."}
{"text":"Older people no the right fit for a fast food and customer service. They are sour and grumpy."}
{"text":"Open til 3am..... but today at 7:15 PM the drive-in is closed and you must go in to order no sign posted.  No one answering the customers in drive-thru. Car full of kids and dog, not an option today."}
{"text":"Given this locations relative proximity to my home, I have given them multiple chances to make up for bad service. Unfortunately they have not. The first time I went here was on a weekday and it was in the mid afternoon. We waited in the drivethru for over 25 minutes. The bad thing was that there was only 4 cars ahead of us! Also, our order was wrong and when I went inside i had to wait 10 minutes in line before being waited on. The second time i went here was on a weekend in the evening and the poor cashier didn't know how to make change so I had to count it for her. The third time I came was thru the drive thru again and it took 17 minutes with only three cars ahead of me. The person at the payment window dropped half my change on the ground and I couldn't get to it to pick it up. Also, no one ever apologizes for the wait. Sometimes that can go a long way. I'm not sure what is happening at this location but I hope they get it figured out because it is convenient for me and the only fast food resturaunt right at the exit for University city Blvd."}
{"text":"POOR POOR POOR POOR MANAGEMENT !!! The manager of this Location is Justine , & she has VERY VERY VERY Bad management , for her team! Apparently there was 2 BRAND NEW hires, and she technically has NO RESPECT for new hires! I ate here for LUNCH & all I heard the whole entire time was her mouth! She needs to realize that she being mean and having NO RESPECT or getting along with her team makes customers like me don't return! I'm calling corporate & they don't even answer, what kind of company is this??? She needs to be replaced and I am gonna make sure she gets terminated. I run a better management then she does!   I asked for my Receipt and she had an attitude. No respect at all. I feel bad for your team . My heart goes out to them for dealing with people like you!!!   Sorry Justine! But you have BAD MANAGEMENT, seems like you don't give a shit about your team especially for new hires. I'll come in and teach you how to manage a franchisee with your team cause you SUCK at it. You either need to drop your position for somebody who's better at it OR drop down to a hourly position .   Your ATTITUDE effects others. Think about it !!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Wendy's in the world.  And that's a stretch because most Wendy's are pretty good.  One night I came in and this huge family cut in front of me.  I only had one small order but would you believe it they served them first before making my one sandwich.  They are very inconsiderate and their work is sloppy.  That was terrible that they did that to me and I've been a loyal customer to them for a long time.  Most of the workers there are okay but I found out the hard way that some of them are hateful.  The dining room is run down and dirty and smells bad.  Their restrooms are always dirty too.  I wouldn't be surprised if their kitchen is also dirty"}
{"text":"They rebuilt this Wendy's and it is amazing. The food however is horrible. I had a simple order of a Homestyle Chicken combo. I made no changes to what the sandwich comes with. Then I waited for my meal. I waited, and waited, and waited. I finally got my food and sat down to eat. The first bite was ok. The second bite a red flag went up. The third bite I spit into a napkin. The chicken was gray and rubbery. It was beyond gross. It was undercooked. I could have taken it back up to the counter and made a complaint but I was already in a time crunch after waiting so long to get my food. I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Our group of special needs adults stopped at this location for lunch.  while waiting in line the manager asked a man in line behind us if he's with our group. When he said no? They opened up another register just For him and closed it right after. As if all of us aren't paying individuals! When I get up to the cash register they manager and her employee are arguing and the employee throws my money in my hand and is telling another employee she's going to walk out. How unprofessional! You need to learn to treat every customer with  the same amount of respect. We were all waiting in line to get food. Not just this one man!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this Wendy's for dinner. We both ordered a burger and a small fries off the dollar menu. We are both two terrible broke college students, so this was sort of a \"date night\" for us. When ordering I asked the cashier if they had by any chance me any fresh fries. He said \"ummm i dunno??\" So I politely asked if we could get our fries from the next fresh batch. When we got our fries it was very clear that they were old and they were very cold. I went back up and asked him if we could have some fresh fries like I asked. He didn't apologize or mention anything about the situation at all. He just walked away and said nothing. So I went back down and sat at my table, waited a few minutes, and then he shouted \"fresh fries!\" Didn't even bother to bring them to our table? It was so rude. Not a please, or a thank you, or smile, or any  sort politeness or common courtesy from him at all the entire time we were there."}
{"text":"Fastest service ever! I love getting breakfast here because I know it will never make me late! The employees are so friendly, too!  During once visit, I had been dieting for a while and decided to treat myself to some fries but they were less than warm. Any other time and I would have eaten them, but I had been craving them so bad!! They happily made me some fresh fries and chatted with me while I waited! It made my day ;)"}
{"text":"The outside may look like one of the Wendy's restaurants of old, but inside and at the drive thru it's the same fast-food fare as every other Wendy's in the rest of the country. Nothing special."}
{"text":"So I'm at Wendy's only because I saw an ad on TV. Yes I know the food never looks like it does in the commercials. But they have baked potatoes. What other fast food joint has baked potatoes? I drove out of my way just to get me some baked potato! Wtf... They're out of baked potatoes. This has happened before. In fact it happens a lot. And it pisses me off! Listen up Wendy (or the people in the corporate office). Figure it out! You must be aware that some people only go to Wendy's BECAUSE you have baked potatoes. The guy behind me also wanted a baked potato and the look on his face was the same as mine, a look of \"what the hell...I could be at jack in the box.\" Well this time I asked the employee what's up with having zero potatoes and he said something about them sitting too long and getting dried out. So I say again Wendy...get some smart people together and figure out how to have potatoes all the time! Your slogan is \"Now that's better.\" Seriously? That's your slogan? \"Now that's just stupid\" as stupid as running out of potatoes.  On a good note, frostys are delicious and also like the free style coke machine."}
{"text":"This place is all bad the mf didn't have no food the night crew is disappointing they only had one bake potato no chilly no fries drink was flat the ppl that work there don't know how to talk to ppl I was gone beat they ass just a very disrespectful ppl there mf need home training would never go back there unless it was white people working there sad to say bekuz I'm a Nigga"}
{"text":"They remodeled. Looked better before. Food seems the same but manager always has a frown. Unfriendly Drive thru staff at night are nice. Seems like quality dropped since recent remodel"}
{"text":"This place is always out of apple pecan salads Grilled chicken wraps. Tonight their tortillas were frozen so no wraps; always something  Can't they anticipate demand here?"}
{"text":"Avoid this Wendy's if possible.  I tried it again, thinking my last experience was just a bad day.  Nope, disappointed again.  The soda was flat, the biscuit was hard, and the chicken was cold.  And the people working there are more interested in what they did last night than helping their customers."}
{"text":"A friend and I go thru the drive thru at least twice a week.  We always order the same thing.  Yet they seem to mess up the order frequently.  The manager is great but she needs to retrain the \"team\""}
{"text":"Worst service and food here tonight. Waited to order about 10 minutes, another 10 minutes for them to give half the order. I sat down and ate my fries, while my partner waited for food. When I opened my \"burger\" it was a plain chicken patty. I took it back for my burger and was eventually given something that almost looked like a burger. It is cold through and through as well as burnt. It was not even hot enough to melt the cheese. I loved Wendy's, but here in Las Vegas it's advisable to stay away from them all."}
{"text":"we wanted to make an order and only the drive thro was  open, my car stopped working a few feets before the window, so i stepped out front of it to make the order, i knocked the window few times, and as it seems in the picture the guys who is working ignored us!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I have ever had at Wendy's. To start off, the cashier was horrific. She had the worst attitude towards me. She then took my order wrong and charged everything separate instead of as a combo. I then asked for my ranch that I asked for on the order. She ends up just throwing across the table at me. I then get continue to get glares from her as I walk out. The food was great, though. But the cashier just put a bitter taste in my mouth and I couldn't stand it. I love Wendy's as a whole, and they usually have great employees that are nice. Just this particular cashier got on my nerves."}
{"text":"Love the baconator. Service is top notch and quick. fry recipe isn't my favorite but a lot of people like it"}
{"text":"The service was terrible at this location and the staff was very rude! Solidified my feelings about this fast food chain."}
{"text":"Chubby lady was really rude in the drive-thru when I came back when they missed my order and didn't give me my Frosty. She pretty much shoved the Frosty onto my hand and had that \"fuck off\" look and attitude. Food was horrible, too cold and very stale, had to give it to my dog."}
{"text":"So I just purchased some food and service was ok I guess, a little better than last time. Except this time I FOUND A HAIR IN MY FROSTY! Had to throw the rest of the food out. Disgusting."}
{"text":"I understand this is a fast food restaurant but oh my goodness. I'm hoping this review gets to a manager so they can change. I have gone to this location four times and each time they mess us. Twice, I asked for chili cheese fries and they gave me cheese fries. One time, I got a Caesar salad and they didn't give me dressing. The fourth time, I got nuggets with their sriracha sauce and they gave me the wrong sauce. On top of that, the entire staff is extremely rude. I was checking my bad the last time I went (because they messed up so many times before) and the cashier actually told me to hurry up so the line could move. As quick as this place is for a lunch break, I'm not giving them another chance. I just want chili fries darnit! Haha"}
{"text":"I have been to this Wendy's multiple times solely because of its proximity to my work. The biggest issue I've had is they are often out of food items (baked potatoes, spicy nuggets, grilled chicken to name a few I've encountered). But they do not tell you while ordering, so that you can look at the menu and pick out something else. I'm always told at the window, sometimes after I've already paid. Then I've  had the hassle of needing to be credited money back. Today the regular nuggets (they didn't have the spicy prepared) and my pulled pork sandwich were cold. Thumbs down for this Wendy's!"}
{"text":"Came in dressed for work, though admittedly with my wheeled cart because I was on my way to Walmart. This was apparently sufficient to get me the \"delay until the customer leaves\" treatment.  You're a crappy burger joint near a Walmart. You have no justification for this level of snobbery."}
{"text":"The apple pecan chicken salad was my favourite. Holy grail go to for fast food, for about 2 years solid.   But recently it's turned to shit. It's gone from chicken that tasted like chicken and looked like chicken, to smelling like boiled hotdog water and tasting like it too.  Horse shit/10"}
{"text":"Wendy's.  It was raining today in Phoenix!    Flatbread sandwich. With medium fries and dp.  Medium is like 20 oz of soda.  I ate the food - it was fast food quality."}
{"text":"Bad service! Slow , food isn't always fresh.went 2 days ago said were waiting on fresh fries bs they were not fresh looked like they were thrown in the oil again !!i just hate the fact that they lie o and it seems like everyone thAt works their is lazy af don't even try to give you yore order correct nd fresh !"}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars only b/c of the guy Xavier working the drive thru today. He provided the best service I've had in a while that wasn't at an In & Out or Chickfila. I don't know if the restaurant should take credit for that. It's more than likely a part of his personality. Oh yea, the fries were fresh and hot so that was a plus. The nuggets and the JBC burger were barely warm. The top part of the bun was actually cold"}
{"text":"Do you remember when Jr. Bacon Cheeseburgers used to cost a dollar. Those were the days. You remember when a gallon of gas used to be ten cents? Me neither.  Anyway, Wendy's will always be my favorite of the lower-end fast food chains. In the quality, cost, quantity matrix, the big W wins every time. It provides the most bang for your buck as they say.  This particular Wendy's is about average. Well-maintained with decent service, it's not a bad little lunch getaway.  That's all for now. I'm going to go pour frosty all over my chest."}
{"text":"Bought 2 spicy chicken sandwiches and also ordered the 4 for 4. Only one of the chicken sandwiches was spicy, none of the food was hot or fresh. (One of the sandwiches tasted like old oil). The workers knew the food was subpar which is why no one answered the phone when I called. This is Vegas. There's fast food on every block. I could have gone anywhere! Wendy's, don't waste my time or hard earned money on food you wouldn't want to eat yourself or serve your family!"}
{"text":"It no longer exists. Construction fences surround it and in its place we'll soon have a Popeye's."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great staff.  Please have two people taking orders at lunch!  I have been in here twice during the lunch hour and the wait to take my order was nearly 10 minutes.  There are a lot of people in line at lunch time and this is a super busy location.  They had one order taker and one person gathering the orders.  Both people did a great job and were fast but the amount of people warrants two order takers.  We love it here and will be back."}
{"text":"Gave me a chicken sandwich with cold buns. This isn't the first time this has happened."}
{"text":"Order was messed up. Ordered salad, got wrong salad with wrong dressing. Kids meal nuggets wrong sauce, fried were cold. Service was super slow in drive thru. When called to talk to manger about about order they hung up on me."}
{"text":"The food definitely hurt my tummy. Effected me all day. French fries were extremely oversalted and I believe that might've been the issue of my sour stomach. I need to learn my lesson about fast food like that already!"}
{"text":"I've had better meals 100 miles out from Bangkok in little jungle restaurants. This food isn't even good enough to be late night drunk food.  Fries limp and cold so ordered fresh batch but oil was from the Clinton administration. Pulled pork was tough and so much slaw I'll be crapping hay bales. 4 for 4 burger was in the dictionary under \"really sucks\".   I don't know how this place stays open with all the other good places around I should have gone to. It must be a brothel!!!! I feel so screwed!!! Perhaps if they changed the menu to Kragen Auto Parts it would do better.   Run Forest Run!!!!!!!  I suppose if I wanted to be gay this would get you in training for assholes."}
{"text":"This place is awful. It's my first time in a Wendy's on Canadian Soil. And first time in maybe 10 years. REGRETS!   So I asked for the dessert section of the menu because I couldnt see it on the backboard behind the cashier. She (the cashier) looked at me, saying \"just frosties\" she then  placed the cup closer to her than me so I had to reach across.   SHE IS NOW LITERALLY VACUMING AROUND ME. after making a horrible scraping sound as she dragged a vacuum along the tiles as opposed to sweeping. Eeeee eee Eeeee eee Eeeee!  Oh G-d. My ears.   The frosty tastes fine. Like a thick milkshake."}
{"text":"Those spicy nuggets hit the spot.  I used to live off of side salads and chicken nuggets when money was tight.  This place still has all my favorite side items for a good price."}
{"text":"Hadn't had a Wendy's hamburger in ages...went though the drive thru...perfect service and got my order right. Friendly customer service. A+"}
{"text":"I don't write a lot of reviews but my god the service at this restaurant was shockingly inappropriate"}
{"text":"It's a Wendy's.  Everything regarding to corporate was right were it should be.  Clean, organized tables...fast, hot food...and polite employees.  I came here for a quick lunch with my friend during our lunch break.  I tried the Pretzel burger, which was delicious but SUPER filling!  Next time I'm skipping the fries and drink and just getting the burger!"}
{"text":"Thee worst Wendy's in the valley. Horrible customer service & the little girls working there don't know what the hell they're doing...smh. Will never come back"}
{"text":"Everything negative said still applies.  Never again Wendy's...not for this location anyway."}
{"text":"I'd give it negative stars if I could. Since the renovations it has been nasty. Tough chicken, no condiments unless you beg for them and drive through ordering please check your bag because more than likely it's wrong or cold. The staff before the remodel was on point and friendly....Miss them!"}
{"text":"I heard that service and employees were both poor and I found out for myself this is true. Stood at the counter for 2+ minutes before being acknowledged by any employee. When a young lady did come to take our order we were not greeted with a \"hello\" or \"sorry for the delay\" - instead we got a \"here or to go\".  Ordered a salad and was told they had none of there salads or potatoes. Decided to go to Paneras down the road and had a tasty salad. BTW both the dining and kitchen area were a mess.   Pass this Wendy's by as there are many other better options in the area."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's, but this place is 100% trash. I've never been treated worse in my life. You definitely need to replace your entire staff."}
{"text":"Stopped to get a quick bite before work and tried the 4 for 4. Everything was cold, my frys tasted like they were sitting in the fry bin for an hour or so. My nuggets same as frys and my double stack was gross only had 1 bite. I will never go back to this Wendy's again. They need to tear that one down!"}
{"text":"Oh the power of a sign that is two minutes away from your house.  Let me tell you a little story about how I was on my way to go pick up a salad... and then three little words stopped me in my tracks: Bacon Portabella Melt. Well, I'm not sure what happened next. The next thing I knew... I was at the drive-thru ordering one.  Was it everything I had dreamed it would be? No. Was it tasty? Yeah, for a fast food burger. You know what would have made it better? If that Wendy chick would've delivered it to my house like she does in the commercial. Seriously, who wants to get up off the comfy couch?  For those judging me about cheating on my salad, I did sub a side caesar for my fries. I do have some will power... although \"some\" should be in really small font.  This location always has pretty good service. Never a long wait. The workers are nice.  It's super convenient on Park Road. However, it is super inconvenient to try to get back to Woodlawn Road."}
{"text":"I've come here 4 times. 3 of the times I went, my order has been wrong. The one time my order wasn't wrong was when I simply ordered an ice coffee. My coffee tasted disgusting. I like Wendy's but this location is horrible"}
{"text":"Slowest \"fast\" food in the area. On a Sunday afternoon, sat in the drive through line without moving for 8 minutes.  So I had my son get out and walk inside while I parked. Only two people inside the restaurant, and finally, 10 minutes later, we're pulling out of the parking lot following the car I was initially behind in the drive through to start with.   The worst part? After all that, they got our order wrong. A sandwich and a salad, 2 ice waters. Simply unbelievable. Heck with it. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Food was fine but way overpriced. Staff was rude and didn't get all of my order so I just went without what they missed instead of them offering to make it for me. No napkins in the bag. No dollar menu"}
{"text":"Hungry and not much options so decided to grab Wendy's. My friend got some fries earlier and they were pretty salty. So, I decided to pick up a single with cheese and a small fry. I asked for less salt, but I guess she couldn't be bothered so just said okay I'll just do no salt. Price came close to $10 and that's without a drink. Pass!"}
{"text":"Awesome accurate and fast. 9pm Wed. Not enough positive things said on yelp! I say it good or bad!"}
{"text":"Needs help. Several visits cause its close. Always getting screwed in the drive thru"}
{"text":"Service is SLOW. Food was barely warm. Do yourself a favor and pass this location by. The Coke guy is here servicing the customer drink fountain. He's going to the BATHROOM to wash out his rag that he is \"CLEANING\" the Coke machine with! Are you kidding me? WTF?"}
{"text":"Very average in every way. Staff eating while making customer food. Way over staffed considering the very mediocre level of customer service. \"Manager\" went out to smoke, came back inside and started preparing food without washing his hands. Even though the drive thru business is very light, they seem to ask almost every car to pull up, park & wait??"}
{"text":"Same experience as other Yelpers. Order is usually WRONG in one way or the other. Won't return here!"}
{"text":"As of right now I don't have any major complaints about this Wendy's other than it being a little slower than most. I try to come earlier than the lunch rush or later and it still seems to be a full house. The other day when I pulled through a woman asked if she could get in front of me in the drive through because they didn't get her dressing our toppings for her salad. I let her go through, and all seemed to go ok. After reading the other reviews about this location I'll be sure to start checking my order before I leave the lot. Also, when making a left turn out of the parking lot it's a little tricky sometimes. Be careful when you hit that gas pedal."}
{"text":"Ah fast food joint, that's not even close to my fave... what can I say about you today? Well, I have to admit when I first saw you close to my humble abode, I was pleased. I drove on past you that first time, and told myself we would become aquainted VERY soon. I know you aren't my fave as I'd mentioned above, but your cheap prices for those Crispy Chicken Cesar wraps just gets my heart a pitter pattering.   The first time I came to meet you it was easy, and I figured we'd be friends in no time flat. I ordered your delicious wrap, and the drive thru was fast like, I truly could just eat and run. You were perfect for this busy lady.   However, the next time I came for a visit, it wasn't as easy as the last time. You see the great state of NC has these things in the roads called a median, and well, Wendy's it's really just a pain to get back to see you when I'm on the opposite side of the road. I mean, in this situation, it really is me and not you...  I don't want you to feel totally rejected though, I mean I do still walk to you on occasion, but your staff are never very polite when I come in & I feel like they are jealous of our relationship. You really need to tell them that there is enough of you for everyone. I mean seriously, you're a fast food chain, and we all have just one belly to feed.   Sigh, I hate notes like this, I really do... but Wendy's if I'm headed the other way I'll just hit Bo Jangles on the way home because there isn't that pesky median dividing us, and well frankly... it's a much healtier alternative with that grilled chicken sandwich they've got.   You'll always have a soft spot in my heart Wendy's, but this just isn't working out for me. Friends?"}
{"text":"It is fast food, so you can't expect a 'true' healthy meal. However, they are pretty efficient even when it is lunch hour especially near a school. And they do accept the coupons that you get in the mail so even better! More savings for those who are on a budget. Always love the frosty and their chili. That's probably the only things I ordered from them."}
{"text":"Mediocre service,  lots of people behind the counter, but too many just standing around."}
{"text":"I have eaten in this location twice, I have been through the drive thru at least 3 times. This is a fast food restaurant so keep that in mind when you dine here. In my experiences at this location, it is very hit or miss. The food and employees and service is either 5 stars or 1 star. For those not familiar with Wendys, they specialize in burgers, chilli and frosties. This restaurant is fairly new to this location and there was a lot of hype at first, now that it has died down a bit the service and food has gotten better. They have a very clean and open interior and they have soda machines with 100s of flavor choices."}
{"text":"Don't eat fast food too often.  I decided to get a Classic burger.  When I read the menu it wasn't offered.  I ask the speaker (drive thru) and she said we have never had a classic.  I said well maybe you renamed it.  She said no. So I ordered another and drove to the window.  That girl said first thing upon opening the window, we don't have a classic and never have.  I thought she was the speaker voice but she said she wasn't.  That was another girl and she had been at Wendy's for a year or two and knew all the menus by heart I was informed. I took my food home.  The French fries were part cooked and a number that were sort of blanched and not fried.  The hamburger was cold.  I know food loses heats on the 1 mile drive home, but no warmth at all? Coke tasted like colored water.  I don't expect great service or even outstanding food, but this was a real disappointment even for fast food.  By the way, if you check the menus they post on line, the Classic burger is offered.  Maybe these girls need to read their own menus."}
{"text":"Cold fries, *horrible* service -- angry, incompetent; we ate in the nearly-empty dining room and enjoyed watching multiple people ask to speak with the manager. With all of the nearby options, it's amazing this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Was just there. It smelled funny. Stood in line for 5 minutes with nobody ahead of me. Nobody acknowledged me. Super slow. Order was incomplete. Not happy at all with the service we received."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  No soap in the mens room.  Big sign over sink, \"Employees must wash hands \".  With what?  Another big sign, \"Let us know if this restroom needs attention \".  Should have another sign saying \" Please do our job for us.\"  No thanks.  We haven't hit bottom yet, but we are sliding downhill damn fast."}
{"text":"I've tried this location twice. Both times involved rude employees who seemed to be annoyed upon my arrival as they needed to put their conversations in hold. One time they screwed up my order and hung up on me (twice!) when I called to report it. I won't be visiting again."}
{"text":"Obviously airport fast food is not expected to be a perfect experience, but today we grabbed a quick bite while waiting on our plane, and had more than the usual frustrations. They were very busy, which I am sure was playing a role. Unfortunately even the easiest orders (a number 1 with a Diet Coke) were incorrectly handed out. While I sat eating, at least three other customers had wrong orders when they received their food. The eating area was well maintained and clean despite the large number of people in and out, so that part was great."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru. We usually don't go to Wendy's because they get our order wrong. Well nothing has changed. Ordered a burger. NO CHEESE. It had cheese. Ordered a regular cola. Got diet. I know they do not hire brain surgeons but I really wonder what type of people actually work there. If you cannot get an order at least once right??  Needless to say the NEW Wendy's in Irwin will never get my business again. I'm done"}
{"text":"Went to drive thru and ordered 1 chili cheese fries and medium strawberry lemonade.   They ended up giving me 2 cheese fries.   I wish they would repeat your order after you have placed it."}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible.. you order upgrade on fries and drink and the picture is what you get"}
{"text":"I'm in one of those phases where my life is on a downward spiral, so Wendy's feels like an appropriate theme-food. In fact I think I pretty much only eat fast food when things are a little bit weird. But don't worry reader, this is still a food review - not a cry for help.  I came by here one evening in search of some nourishment that would not exit my bowels in an explosive fashion. I feel that's not too high a demand to put on my meals, though with fast food you can almost never be certain.  And while I WAS eating fast food, I didn't want to go whole hog and commit culinary suicide by eating a baconator. As a side note, I once saw an old woman trying to kill herself at a Wendy's. What I mean by that is she was about 80 years old with a breathing tube in her nose, sprinkling EXTRA salt on a hamburger. Death by food - an unconventional choice.  I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with a side salad and a sprite to drink. I ordered it to go.  Now, here's something that seems frivolous and unnecessary. I'm like, 95% sure Wendy's butters their buns. As if the calorie count wasn't high enough! It tastes delicious of course, but it's only slightly excessive.  Aside from that discovery (and perhaps because of it) my Spicy Chicken sandwich delivered on my incredibly low expectations.  But then I was blown right out of the water like a Somalian pirate ship that made the mistake of trying to loot an aircraft carrier. Their side Caeser salad is actually right on par or superior to that of a sit down restaurant. Probably because sit-down restaurants keep their salads in giant buckets and scoop it out with big ugly metal spoons like some sort of cartoon cafeteria.  Anyways, this salad restored my faith in humanity a little bit. I especially appreciated the cheese flakes and the croutons. Good work Wendy's, you made salads that are actually worth consuming out of a little plastic box.   I did that weird thing I do where I order a meal to go and then immediately consume it in my car, right outside the restaurant. Am I alone in that?  Oi, vey."}
{"text":"I work across the street. We get lunch here weekly.. if I get told to pull off their timer with NO one else in line one more time. I am calling corporate.  I should be able to stay at the window until my order is ready..  how do i know your not spitting In my food? I will no longer pull forward so you can get a fake time.. smh"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! They refused to give a discount, which I have received from this location many times in the past. When asked if this was a policy change the girl behind the counter simply walked away. I had to get my receipt from the other side of the counter and ask for my drink from another employee as she was too busy chatting in the back. After 20 minutes of waiting for my chicken sandwich, fries and nuggets I walked up to the counter to ask what was taking so long. The same girl walked up and asked if she could get me anything, I informed her about the 20 minute wait and she simply walked away without a word. She then walks up and asks if I want to wait 2 minutes for fries, I ask why the additional wait and am given a response of \"do you want fries or not?\" As she again walks away. I began to call after her asking for a manager when the manager walked up. It turns out the girl had removed my order from the board, so no one knew about my order. The girl then plops my food onto a tray (if she'd finished my order I would have told her it was to go), when informed it was a to-go order the manager asked the girl to put it in a bag. The girl refused with a \"I'm not putting it in a bag for her\". The manager insisted so the girl walked over and plops a bag down next to the tray and walks away, leaving me to package my own food. The manager did appologize and package my food. The girl (whom I won't name for her sake) needs some additional training in customer service. I know it can be difficult to work in fast-food, but taking it out on a customer is uncalled for. I usually visit about once a week as this location is on my way home from School... I'm not sure Wendy's will be my first choice anymore..."}
{"text":"SLOWEST DRIVE THRU EVER!!! Waited 20 minutes in the drive through for a damn burger after I was blocked in... It was like 7:30 and it wasn't like this place was popping off, there was NO ONE inside. What happened to FAST food. This isn't the only place where service is lacking, but another to add to the list."}
{"text":"I'm rating this as far as Wendy's go. They get a lot of service. Never had a messed up order. Never got sick. And it's decently clean throughout the place. Occasionally there are a lot of teenagers working but I haven't had a problem."}
{"text":"I used to come to this Wendy's a lot when I lived on this side of town. Today was probably one of the worst days that I've been there. The line outside was very long, given it was rush-hour, but when  went inside to order there was a gentleman that was already waiting he said over five minutes and no one had even approached him. I waited approximately two minutes, no big deal but the person that helped us was not very pleasant. No smile or \"sorry for the wait\" to either the gentleman or myself. I counted 4 times that I said \"thank you\" through out 2 separate orders to Maureen (the one taking the order) and she never once said anything back.   Food was ok, tea was made too sweet this time compared to other times. Customer service is most important to me though and it was a major fail this time."}
{"text":"Came here after learning that our flight back to San Jose was going to be delayed by [at least] an hour.....  Our party of three unanimously decided to head to Wendy's specifically for 3 bowls of the Rich & Meaty Chili. According to them, this dish is low in fat & high in fiber- SCORE! We decided to throw in an order of fries since it would compliment the soup perfectly.  The fries were good- they were salted well and piping hot. The three bowls of Rich & Meaty Chili were good but I had to deduct one star because the temperature wasn't as hot as I normally would expect for soup to be.   4 Stars. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"nobody takes pride in what they do anymore.. even though the cashier was nice, they cooks and manager could give a crap what the food looks and tastes like.. my first job was wendys when i was 14 and I didnt serve anything i wouldn't eat myself.. i constantly threw old fries in the garbage... this place gave me old fries and nuggets.. i can tell i ate wendys everyday for years.."}
{"text":"What a joke. Patricia has been on her phone almost the whole time i have been here.  I have been a cook for 17 yrs. started at Wendy's. Haven't seen this kind of disrespect for a job in 17 yrs."}
{"text":"Rude cashier!!!! Some big girl. I come here all the time but this was a 1st... I've had a spanish lady before she was nice & good service... But big girl 2nite took my order then was outside smoking i don't know if it was a break or she was off right after taking my order but she needs a talking too from management!"}
{"text":"Okay, just finished my cheeseburger, chili and pop.  Not bad when it's coupon time.  Place is nice to hang out.  Not crowded at night anyways don't know about the days.  The decor is dated and needs to be refreshed especially the chairs and tables. The rug needs to be replaced with something that doesn't scream \"run away!\".  The staff have been really nice to me every time I happen to pop by. Guess it's my personality :-)"}
{"text":"I ordered a quick snack since I forgot to eat lunch.  I went through the drive thru.  I ordered some fries and a small burger.  My order was correct and tasted like it's supposed too.  The service was good and I was in and out of there quickly.  I went around 4:30pm.  I didn't have an issue."}
{"text":"So sad!  I used to enjoy this location alot, its close by. Easy. Fast.   However, their staff is something to be reckoned with. Every time we go through tbe drive through, we're greeted by a voice that doesnt want to be there. Or theyre just plain rude. I get it. I fully understand.   Anyway, this location no longer sells iced coffee, I can perhaps guess why, Im not sure any of the staff knew how to make it without it tasting something like coffee flavored tea, and having a warm temperature. Its unfortunate because this location would be a gold mine. Theres nothing but financial businesses close by. And I used to see groups of people walking across the street on their break. Not so much anymore.   Thankfully Phoenix is full of fast food restaurants. Hopefully this location will be on the up and up soon!"}
{"text":"I mean, if you lock the doors before 12:30am and have the drive-through open, it would make sense to have enough staff left so that people aren't sitting in the drive-through line for more than 20 minutes.. Can't vouch for the food yet but man this wait is ridculous."}
{"text":"How hard is it to get orders right? I swear to god, this was my last time being really disappointed by this wendys.   Nobody's expecting 5 star meals okay, sometimes we crave some good ol wendys. This is the one closest to my house, and the past THREE times I've gotten takeout from here they have messed up my order. I can't eat mayo and order everything without mayo, when I opened my burger what did I see? Mayo. Fries? Cold and mealy as is the new usual. Other locations manage to do a great job, what is it with this location?? I've worked in foodservice enough, I know how it is. But when I went today it wasn't even busy at all whatsoever, none of the times have been when it's busy so whyy does this wendys always mess up orders??  It's so disappointing. Wasted enough money all 3 times for food I couldn't even eat. 3 times in a row, at that. For a broke (and hungry) college student does management even understand how frustrating this is.."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I went through the drive ordered 2 burgers wanted extra onions. They put one small piece on each burger. I went inside was informed onions did not com on that burger so that was considered extra onion. Not to mention the pile of mayonnaise on burger.  The manager was very rude, on the plus side the regional manager did call me and apologized."}
{"text":"Oh, finally a Wendy's with some decency!  I've eaten here at this location on and off for the past few years, and today was no different. I was on the way to the Arabian Horse show at Westworld, and my stomach was grumblng-loudly  I came in here to have an early lunch before I headed into the event. This place over the years has always been one of my favorite locations because their always consistent.  Food is hot and ready, staff is friendly and the dining area's always clean.    Today I went with the combo # 1, and it was out in no time.  Bathrooms were well stocked and clean, and the condiment's were well stocked. I will say I like this location more then others. Kind of buried in the shopping center, but its clean and nice just about every single time I go here.  Oh, and their new breakfast's?  AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here on and off since I moved to this side of town a few months ago, and I have a mixed bag of thoughts for this place.  The experiences have been a combination of fine, okay, and a few \"that was really bad\" experiences as well.  For starters, the food here is pretty consistent, and the menu itself is like every other Wendy's. I like Wendy's because I like a lot of their menu items, and I don't feel so guilty for eating fast food after leaving here.  Overall, the chain is great, but this location's kinda weird.  For starters, sometimes I've come here and the place has felt and looked sub par when dining in.  For a while, the carpeting in their dining area looked filthy, and it grossed me out.  Now the carpeting is clean, so I guess they had to cleaned and de-filthed.  Other times, when in the drive through, the service has been okay.  I remember one time I was here in the middle of the day (like 3 pm, so it wasn't a busy meal hour) and even though I ordered a single combo meal, they made me pull forward and wait with another car for them to walk my order out.  Um, I can't imagine why they would do that, since it wasn't really all that busy.  I ended up waiting about 5 minutes, maybe 10 in the parking lot with another car for my food.  This morning I saw a white van that went through the drive through and they were waiting as well for their food to get walked out.  Unless the drive thru people are trying to shave time off how long it takes them to get their drive thru order, it doesn't make any sense.  I wish it were more consistent in this area.  After having been to a few Wendy's this is the only location that has this bad habit in their drive thru and its kind of annoying.   I will say, sometimes I come here and think, \"this place is so dirty today and it took forever to get my food, I'm going home and giving it one star.\" Other times I come here and everything is fine, and I think \"ya know what? It wasn't so bad today, I'm going to go home and give them 5 stars.\"  I settled on 3 because I figured it was a fair assumption of both the good and bad experiences that I've had here.  Most of my complaints are in regards to cleanliness and wait times, not so much the food, because the food is consistent and tasty."}
{"text":"I've come here for lunch on and off for the past few months I've been working at my new job.  This place isn't half bad, and its just like any other wendys I've been to.  Lunch hour is busy in the resturant and the drive through, so come prepared and expect some delays when ordering.  They also serve breakfast here, and I've never had a bad experience yet!  In and out in no time!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this location has so many reviews with low ratings. I came here the other day and I had a very positive experience here.   I came here day after Christmas as most of the places I wanted to go to were closed, so I decided to stop in here and get something quick. There was no one in line when I got here, so I was able to order right away. The lady who took my order was polite and fast. She took my order and repeated it to make to make sure she had it correct. By the time I filled my drink cup my food was ready. I didn't even check to see if my order was correct before I left, but when I got home everything was great. The burger was tasty and hot. My fries were crispy with not too much salt on them and my drink tasted good as well.   Tables seemed like they were all cleaned off and the floors were cleaned. The drink station with the condiments and utensils was clean and stocked with all the necessities. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"3 stars because I've been there twice and had one five-star experience and one one-star experience. The first time, service was excellent, fries were hot and crisp with the right amount of salt. Second time, went at 9:30 pm and they were out of baked potatoes and they only had full size salads (I wanted a half or side salad). Attendant was unfriendly and did not apologize for either inconvenience. We left because they didn't have either thing I wanted."}
{"text":"Food from here is always fresh and service is friendly. We waited maybe 1 minute longer than usual today and our attendant apologized for the wait and assured us it would be out soon."}
{"text":"I don't usually ever eat at Wendy's I am a technician for directv and am constantly out on the road eating out and Franky I will not be eating Wendy's here ever again I arrive at 9:05 and no one helps me at the drive thru even though I made eye contact with several employees I proceed to enter this establishment and approach the cash register and multiple employees make eye contact with me and refuse to attend me, one I am finally helped I received horrible customer service, you know that kind of \"why the he'll are you here\" type of attitude."}
{"text":"been to this wendys a few times not the best customer service but its ok if ur really hungry i have not returned to this location since the redesign to the walmart in that complex (the reason is because they have a subway in walmart now)"}
{"text":"Scum. Slowest service I've ever had. Took me an hour to get a terrible sandwich. Cashier was so rude, acting like I'm the reason he's working fast food."}
{"text":"Most disappointing Wendy's experience... and I'm a Wendy's fan. Came here during dinner time and was handed my burger within a minute after ordering, so it obviously wasn't fresh. Stiff cheese, cold/old patty's, bacon etc. Avoid this location and just go to Smash-Burger across the street if you're already willing to pay for a this priced burger."}
{"text":"This place would be great if it was open.  Note to wendys and every other food place at the phoenix airport....tsa security opens at 3 AM so it would make sense for food to be available then instead of waiting until 5 AM.   FAIL"}
{"text":"Glad that my order came out right but the cashier at the drive thru did not even say hi. It wasn't very inviting. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Wendy's should have double drive thru lines like McDonalds and Cook Out. No matter what time of day I come, the line is always 10-15 minutes long and down to the Target parking lot. They are extremely slow. I've never had any problem with my order or the food being cold."}
{"text":"So this happened.  Kind of disgusting. 1. Cheese sauce should not have meat chunks.  2. LIQUID Cheese sauce should not look like cheese curds. 3. Make the correct patties, if it's late at night and you are using whatever you have available to make your life easier, you don't understand the concept of customer service. This was a double with one properly sized patty and 2 smaller ones.  4. Consider remodeling your staff and training systems before fixing your store. No point in looking nice and new if your service is consistent with garbage. Whole restaurant looks a mess.  I cannot stress how important it is to invest in a staff that actually gives a crap about what they do, your business with benefit. Lackadaisically doing your job is worth about as much as a lock without the key. Thank you and goodnight."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch earlier today, I was greeted with a friendly smile at the pick up window. The food was fresh and the service was great!"}
{"text":"THIS MOTHER FUCKER REALLY HAD THE AUDACITY TO GIVE ME A DIRTY ASS LOOK BECAUSE I PAID IN ALL CHANGE, ain't you ever seen a broke girl before? every employee here is rude and also they never get your order right. TO THE LADY THAT GAVE ME THAT LOOK, you don't like my change i'll take my change somewhere else... you'd think you'd be nice because i was a paying customer. Rude rude rude"}
{"text":"(This is a review of fast food joint - specifically Wendy's, not to be confused with the finer dining places in the area)  I'll step it up a notch because this Wendy's is NOT as ghetto as some I've been in around the 'Heights' area.  It also seems like they give two shi%s about the food sent out to customers.  Problems in the past have been rectified promptly and even gave us some freebies for the next visit.  I guess the only thing I would change would be the parking situation, it gets a little cramped with one of the grocery store exits directly across the street.    I will also agree that Wendy's do a great sandwich and as Justin stated: The Spicy Chicken Sandwich consistency is very important to some of us.  I'll add the chili as my side and I am one happy camper although the new 'fry' is quite delicious."}
{"text":"Listen up - I love Wendy's. They have good burgers, the salads are tasty and who hasn't wished a Frosty was a real person they could love and bring home to their parents?  This location isn't that hot, though. It's really a Tim Hortons with a Wendy's thrown in for people who don't want to wait in the Tim's line.   Before I go further - I should say I would give the drive-thru four stars. They are nice, fast and accurate. But for the purpose of this review, I'm writing about the in-store dining experience.  The Wendy's portion is butted right up against the door so when there's a lineup that is long enough to be in front of the door - which is a lineup that contains up to three people - you're constantly moving out of the way for people coming and going. Plus in the winter it's chilly! Because of the small service area for Wendy's, the lineup eventually has to go left or right and this always confuses people. It seems the average person finds it infinitely disconcerting as to determine where the end of the line is once it's made the turn.  And lest we take note this Wendy's has seating from the early 1980s. They need to update with some booths and chairs that aren't made of iron. Man I hate that sound when they move across the floor.  TO SUM IT UP: Normally bacon combined with anything is great but a poor service counter and seating meant to ensure you obey the 15 minute maximum sign make for a less than pleasant quick service dining experience."}
{"text":"The food was typical. But they played religious music. I am not religious and don't appreciate having Jesus shoved down my throat. I came for food, not church. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Frosty. that's about it for me.  As with  just about any other fast food, I'd rather gnaw on my steering wheel."}
{"text":"This might be the worst Wendy's I've ever been to. The staff is not at all friendly or welcoming. The girl at the drive-through was not capable of taking an order and collecting money at the same time so there was only one person passed the ordering station at a time and the drive-through was completely backed up. If she was not capable of running the drive-through they should've had someone else assisting her. The quality of food is not nearly what it should be for a Wendy's. I was very disappointed in not only the service but the food quality. Someone should look into improving this Wendy's. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming here , staff is rude and can't get an order right to save their lives. Food is basically thrown out the window at you with not a word said ."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the drive thru is pack and the service is bad. It shouldn't take 15 minutes to order and get your food through the drive thru. A line is always wrapped around the corner and again the service is slow and bad."}
{"text":"OK Food, Slow Service When I have the craving for a Wendy's burger, this is one of two locations that I can tolerate.  The food is usually good,  I've learned to check before pulling off.  As for slow service, I work nights, so I'm usually picking up something on my way to work.  The remodel looks nice, but the new LED outdoor lighting flashes at a frequency that makes me sick to my stomach, and the drive through speaker is WAY too loud!  I wish in addition to the face-lift they had improved service."}
{"text":"As I was ordering there was a COCKROACH crawling up he wall behind the cash register. I got my food refunded."}
{"text":"I got an asiago bacon ranch chicken sandwich and not only did they not give me the BACON. (most important part) the chicken was dry as hell. Way to blow it, idiots."}
{"text":"Congratulations, Wendy's, your track record is 100% - every time I order NO tomatoes, you put EXTRA. Must be something in your training, as it's universal.  Page 236 of the employee handbook, \"When a customer orders no tomatoes, you can assume they are delusional. They surely meant double tomatoes. Give them extra and they will see the error of their ways. After all, we know what's best for them. They will thank you for it, like Obamacare or the TSA.\"  They get three stars because the food quality was actually quite good (once I got my revised version). They were also very quick.   They would have gotten 4 stars if the lady behind the counter hadn't rolled her eyes, as if to say, \"This PITA actually wants her order correct? As if!\"  Also, since they screwed up, they should have offered a free drink, French fry, or at least an extra napkin. Even a sorry would have been nice."}
{"text":"Rude cashier (Tatiana) who needs to not be at the register. Got my order wrong. Slow service."}
{"text":"Due to some changes in diet I had to try the chicken nuggets. I think my son said it best. They are \"the best of the worst\" . Better than crap like McDonald and Carl's jr but still kinda weak. Went thru drive thru and they forgot a couple items so had to go back in. Handled it well though. Didn't ask for receipt or question it. My wife enjoyed her small Caesars salad."}
{"text":"I live no where near this Wendy's and yet I've been here more often than I normally would. Now let's get a few things clear first. It's not the spectacular food that brings me back again and again. It's Kijiji.  Now you may be wondering what the hell do a fast food chain has to do with a website purely for the sale and resale of used goods?  I have no idea either, but time and time again, this seems to be the place kijijians (can I call them that?) prefer to meet up. As a meet up spot it's fantastic. The place is warm, well lit. It has comfortable seating, and food and drinks should your buyer/seller arrive late. There's always a table handy so you can inspect the goods and or count money.  Since it's a public area, you do feel safer, and the chances of being mugged are slim to none.  Overall, I give this \"Wendy's\" meet up spot a 4 out of 5 stars. The only thing in between it getting a 5 is food quality. While I do enjoy the food here, I wish there where a little more variety. And maybe a better coffee selection."}
{"text":"The BEST Wendy's I've been to! ALWAYS clean. The staff is ALWAYS nice. They're ALWAYS doing things in a timely manner. Even in the drive through! I've NEVER had a mistake OR problem with the quality here. I've been going to this one for YEARS."}
{"text":"Can I give less than a 1 star? Left the airport at 12:15am, waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes, ordered a double and a baconator, drove 20 minutes to the Airbnb, burgers were RAW! Called Wendy's, they suggested I come back. No thank you. I suggested they refund my card, no one on staff now has knowledge about refunding card...or cooking burgers, apparently."}
{"text":"Their two star review is not surprising at all.   Good service and fast food is somewhat of an oxymoron, however, this is just unacceptable. I stopped in for lunch today, get away from the office for a few and have a chicken sammy, their spicy chicken sandwich is really good.   1. No greeting or smile from any single staff member.  2. There were a few people in line waiting to be helped, took a few moments, as apparently it takes three employees to read an order ticket and pour a coke.  3. It took almost 10 minutes for my turn in a line of 4 people.  4. Ever single table was a mess and chair all over the place. 5. My food was practically thrown at me, and minus the sauces that I requested.  6. And I am pretty sure he sour puss behind the counter scowled at me as I rolled my eyes in disgust at what was going on.   It's hard to disappoint at a fast food establishment, as I am sure we are all going in with pretty low expectations to begin with, but honestly, just a hello and smile would have made a world of difference here."}
{"text":"Usually good service, but get rid of that automatic greeting! This voice that sounds like a real person taking your order tells you to go ahead with your order whenever you are ready. When you do start ordering, you're cut off at some point and asked to start over. Every. Time. Just get rid of what I am guessing is meant to be a time saver because it isn't working.   I like that strawberry lemonade though! There's a man who works in the evenings who is very friendly and does his job well."}
{"text":"Welcome to Wendy's, or rather, no welcome at all.   I had placed my order at the drive thru, and like most experienced consumers, I was sure to be as specific as possible to assure minimal confusion. She asked, I answered, nothing out of the ordinary. I paid for my food, and while doing a brief glance, there was the awkward waiting period before I left. Assured I had everything, I left without a thought in my head.  About ten minutes into my drive heading home I had a feeling, and I checked the bad once more. There was no sauce, which we were both specific about when I had ordered, as well as my two cookies. This is just one of many different scenarios that I have encountered here at this Wendy's location. Upon my second arrival, I made my complaint at the drive thru, where I was acknowledged and told to drive to the window. When I pulled up to the window, I was asked again what my complaint was, even though I had just explained and was made to feel like I was acknowledged. I was only granted my sauce and my two missing cookies, yet nothing else to compensate for the inconvenience. This location lacks service, awareness and consideration. Yet the worst part about this Wendy's location, is not the expected incompetence, but the simple theme of not caring. They just do not care. We are but one customer out of a cycle of a hundred they see in a single work period. I enjoy Wendy's, but I do not enjoy their employee's disregard for others."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Went there on 11/22. No one in line so it should have been easy enough. Well, no one except another Wendy's employee that was in full uniform and ordering a combination that the cashier had no idea how to ring up. Meanwhile my wife and I stood in line as the two Wendy's employees stood there bantering, oblivious to paying customers waiting to order.  Let me take a step back and say that my expectations of Wendy's are not high. Just that someone will be there to take the order and we will get the food. That's the whole expectation.  Anyways, the nonsense continued at the register without any acknowledgement that we were in line waiting for two Wendy's employees to conduct a transaction that happens thousands of times a day throughout America.  Yada yada yada. We left after waiting a little longer. Never got an acknowledgement even as we walked out of the \"line\" and toward the door. Anyways, Wendy's is fine. This one is not."}
{"text":"Ordered a Taco Salad rip off. Didn't receive chips plus got chili I never ordered. Check your orders before you leave."}
{"text":"I live in this city and have gotten food here for over 20 years.  I have dealt with the manager several times about incorrect orders or missing food from drive-thru and have gotten adequate help.  Today I walked in at 11:30a for lunch and it was busy, but the food was moving.  I ordered a half apple pecan chicken salad.  No drink, no side, nothing complicated.  While waiting 5 people who ordered full meals got their food before me, including someone who ordered the same salad minus cheese.  I then notice that the girl who took my order never got the salad out of the cooler for the chicken to be put on.  When I start walking to the counter she noticed me and grabbed it and asked another person what goes with the salad (type of dressing, walnuts, etc).  When the other person asked if I ordered anything else I said no, but I'm guessing the person 3 orders after me got my salad except with no cheese, the 'meat' guy said \"oops\" and laughed.  At that point the girl who took my order is still aimlessly walking in circles looking for the pomegranate dressing.  I spot the manager and mention that I still don't have my food but 5 orders have been fulfilled that ordered after me.  She asks what I order and the two girls at the register say they have it.  The manager then asks if I want a free frosty or fries.  I say no thanks, just my salad which has now taken a full 10 min.  She then shrugs her shoulders and says \"well, sorry\".  In shock at her unhelpfulness, she doesn't help her employees, I ask \"that's it??\"  She replies with \"I apologized\"  and starts to walk away.  I couldn't believe her response so I just grab my food to go.  When I get back to work I notice 1. I have no fork or napkins, 2. I have no dressing or walnuts (the girl is still probably walking in circles trying to find them, 3.  there is no blue cheese on my salad BUT i did get red onions that don't even come on the salad... Manager has got to go."}
{"text":"If i could give zero stars i would. It never fails everytime i visit my order is screwed up. Whucj is why i hardly ever eat wendys. Get it together pay attention."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this Wendy's has such a poor rating; my experience here was fine. Maybe I lucked out and came at just the right time or maybe there's been a turnover in staff since the last reviews. I went through the drive-thru and everyone I came in contact with was friendly and my order was correct. Really, for a fast food joint, that's the most you can hope for. I'm satisfied with my experience here. Hopefully it's not just a one-time lucky trip."}
{"text":"Not the best customer service...first she was to busy talking with the other employs she didn't even realize we were there, they also didn't give us our total that just took our card and then they just gave us our food, then went right back talking,..doesn't say have a nice night or anything."}
{"text":"Stood at the register for 10 minutes. No one said anything to us and never took our order."}
{"text":"This Wendy's blows. I'm forced to visit this location because I work right around the corner. I ask for Diet and I get Sprite. I ask for a side of pickles and I get a side of mayo. I order an $8.00 full sized salad and I get a bowl lettuce leafs in a pool of water.   Workers and managers are flat out rude."}
{"text":"we went there the other night and we were going from the drive through, first they got our order wrong, instead of substituting my fries with chillies they added an extra chilli to my order. when i told them they got my order wrong, the manager on the inside rolled his eyes and was bitching to the employee cause he needs to void the transaction now... while i can hear the conversation clearly... while we were waiting for the employee to fix our order the manager ran out side to help the car behind us in order to \"help\" the service time... but by doing so his ass was right infront of my face because he was talking to the employees through the window... and he did not say sorry or acknowledge us being there by his not so sexy ass... i just left without getting my food... never have i felt so disrespected by a manager that was so unprofessional and rude by sticking his ass by my car window in front of my ass... i wish i could leave a negative star review for this place!"}
{"text":"This place was good customer service especially for me coming 30 mins to closing KC was great  thanks guys."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Waited in line inside for 15 minutes (yes I kept track), two ppl in front of me left frustrated. Employees would not even acknowledge the six ppl in line until I said asked if they were going to take any more orders tonight. The response wasn't \"sorry for the wait\" or \"be right with you\" it was a look of can't you see I'm busy with \"I'm trying to get these orders out\" and a then staring back at me. Needless to say I left and will not be back. NO customer service skills at all and no communication as to how much longer it would be. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"This is one of the shittiest Wendy's I've ever been to. I don't know why I keep giving them another chance; guess I'm hoping for improvement. I ordered my lunch just minutes ago. I triple checked that my order was correct and asked the cashier to read it back to me. Stupidly I drove away before checking my food. My sandwich is all wrong and my fries are cold. The fries have NEVER been hot every time I go there. I don't even want to eat this soggy shit."}
{"text":"Nice interior. Staff was friendly and food was fresh.  Really enjoyed it. I just moved to this side of risk and will be Making this Wendy's my choice."}
{"text":"Just came in the other day and ordered a chicken asiago ranch club, ordered without lettuce or tomato, when I got it it didn't have ranch on it so had to go back and they asked if I wanted them to remake it I said yes, they bring me another one and after I leave again I notice it's the same exact sandwich just with ranch splattered all over it, not the first time I've had problems here either, workers are just plain lazy and don't care. Too bad I can't give them 0 stars"}
{"text":"This is the Wendy's closest to my house, so needless to say, it is the one I most frequently visit. 99% of the time, the service is great. However, this review reflects a single negative visit that will stick in my mind every time I visit one of their restaurants.   This would have been roughly a year and a half ago. I went to this restaurant with my girlfriend to get some dinner, and ordered (among other things) a vanilla Frosty Shake. When I got to the window, an older, grayish-haired guy was working, and I tried to hand me a chocolate shake.  As nice as possible, I said to the gentleman that it was supposed to be a vanilla shake. The proper thing to do would have been to say \"I'm sorry, I'll take care of it for you.\"  But this guy didn't do that. He SLAMMED the drive-thru window shut in my face, THREW the shake into the garbage as hard as he could, and screamed something at another employee (possibly profanity, I couldn't tell with the window closed.) I have reported this on the company's website and haven't seen this particular employee there since, so that leads me to believe it was taken care of.  Let's be realistic - I'm always going to eat at Wendy's. This is NOT a bad location, but sometimes a bad visit can negatively impact your whole view on a restaurant chain. I still love their food and still go here, though it's going to be hard to think of Wendy's and not think about this experience."}
{"text":"When I was working in an office in this area, this was one of my most frequent dining experiences.  Wendy's scores major points because their drive-thru lines are the fastest in the business. More often than not, you are served promptly and correctly.  Even at this restaurant, that is usually true. However, at this restaurant, they seem to have a difficult time telling the difference between milk, Frostys, and Frosty Shakes. Numerous occasions I ordered a Frosty Shake, only to have them try to give me a regular Frosty at the pick-up window - and on at least one occasion they were standoffish when I explained this to them. Other times, I have ordered a chocolate milk, and they respond with something like \"what kind of Frosty did you want?\" I NEVER once used the word Frosty.  Despite my rant, the good does outweigh the bad at this particular location. Just make damn sure they get your order right before you drive off."}
{"text":"This new Wendy's is great. They've updated the place to have a modern fireplace and seating area. The food is served in a punctual manner and looks very appetizing.  The buns are very soft and the meat is fresh. The hamburgers are neatly prepared and not just slapped together. The staff was very accommodating even after making a mistake by putting sauce on my wrap that I did not want sauce on.   I definitely like the facelift given to this place and will probably stop by more often now that it has a new look and better service."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst fast food restaurant that has ever existed!  Terrible from start to end. Started out in the drive thru. After 10 min barely moved. I decided to go inside. Waited 10 min and was never even acknowledged. I walked out with the 2 people behind me."}
{"text":"Ew.  Wendy's used to be my favorite fast food restaurant.  WTF happened to their hamburgers?  They taste like beef-flavored mud with condiments now.  Their fries are terrible too as of late.  What's not terrible is their service.  This is the fastest service and delivery of food that I have ever seen from a fast food joint.  Five stars for service.  Unfortunately, I cannot rate by service alone.  Yuk."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try the new Queso Burger. To Go! Nothing near the looks of the presentation they advertise on the commercial. Compete mess, slopped together with minute toppings, couldn't even find or taste the queso sauce. (See picture)  Very disappointing bland Queso Bacon Burger!  I had to add more red onion and put BBQ sauce on it for added flavor-when I got home.  Fries were underdone & super flimsy!  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This Wendy's had been a reliable source for decent fast food until recently.  Yesterday my son and I both ate the chicken nuggets and we up all night.  We each experienced symptoms common with food poisoning.  I will spare you--you are welcome!  I imagine a dirty kitchen, with dirty little hands touching this body part and that stanky thing before handling my food. Wash your hands with warm, soapy water A LOT!!"}
{"text":"Want to time travel without leaving Toronto, or getting into the TARDIS? Feel like stepping into the 1960's McDonald's children's section? Welcome to  Wendy's @ 2136 Kipling, where time seems to have taken a Rip Van Winklesque nap since the 1960s.  The food is acceptable by Wendy's standards: fast, good in the short term and not so good in the long term. The service is efficient but cold.  This Wendy's location won't be anyone's restaurant of choice but it has its utilitarian value."}
{"text":"Every single time I go to this location I am actually amazing how much worse it gets. This location is so close to my work that I always give it the benefit of the doubt. Huge mistake. The customer service might be the worst i've ever experienced from any sort of public establishment. It's so bad that It's actually funny. Last time (and final time) I went, I walked inside to the register to order. The lady just stared at me without saying a word, so I just started my order. I then order a spicy chicken sandwich meal and she puts homestyle on the order, so i politely correct her to make it spicy. Well when i got the order, It was still homestyle, except it just had pickles and ketchup on it.. So... apparently to this person, \"spicy\" means \"add ketchup and pickles\". The service there is so pathetic (even for a fast food joint) that It's literally hilarious. I couldn't help but laugh at the terrible state of this Wendy's. If you want to be simply astounded by the amount of poor and useless customer service, then i recommend you visit this location. You may not get any of the food you ordered.. But at least you'll be able to witness the absolute worst Wendy's in the country. Thanks for the laughs Wendys! Cause that's about all you can provide for people there"}
{"text":"What a joke!(night crew) 4/3/2018. 40 minutes before close the frosty machine is being cleaned. It's going to take longer to cook meal. Either close at midnight as stated, or close earlier if you need more time. And then think it's funny to offer the melted product. I wish you both worked for Donald Trump so we called all read that you've been fired in a tweet tomorrow!   P.S. Offering disgusting soup like frosty, though entertaining to you two, is unacceptable to myself as a customer. Also, a cold soup would be called gazpacho. Had you said that I would not have been so irritated.   Day crew has been moderately decent on most occasions."}
{"text":"When they eventually got the NO cheese part of our order right the food was great.  loses two stars because it took 3 attempts to explain no cheese in our burger please."}
{"text":"Went to this location a couple of weeks ago after my youngest son (8) and I shopped at the nearby Charlotte Premium Outlets. This was the first time I went to this location. As far as the food goes, it was typical Wendy's fare and typical fast food.  The young man who took my order was outstanding! He was polite, pleasant and helpful. When I was trying to decide on a sauce for some chicken nuggets I ordered, he suggested a spicy one as I said I like spicy sauces. While we were dining, at one point he was going around wiping tables and stopped by our table to ask how I liked the sauce he recommended. I was inpressed since he really didn't need to do that. The interior of this location was nice and clean."}
{"text":"Just went to order food The lady named Rosã taking orders was just rude and rushed. Didn't even greet us just said What's Your Order, didn't give us a min before pushing us to order again. Both got chicken nuggets and told her what sauce we wanted and she didn't bother to put any sauce for our nuggets in the bag. I did drive thru for 3 years at burger king and she should not be working that.... very displeased with our service! Also just got home to fund out she didn't even give us all of our food!!!! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this place. The drive through has messed up my order. They didn't give me both drinks. I go back get the drinks. Get back home the burgers are wrong. I quit going there for a yr. I heard they made changes and the drive through did me wrong again. It sucks they are the only Wendy's in summerlin south. I won't go there again"}
{"text":"This is kind of a difficult review to write - which seems ridiculous as it is a standard fast food chain. When the food is fresh and the order is correct I would easily give this place four stars - and that is most of the time. their burgers beat down any other fast food place (save for In-N-Out). However, when the place is running behind or your fries are clearly the last of the last batch quality falls sharply. Also as much as I love their breakfast (again when its done correctly), I have had the wrong order come out twice and have to drive back around, had paper left on the cheese - and thusly on my sandwich and in my mouth (wtf?), etc. And as much as I wish it would be the success rate with breakfast is much lower in my experience. ALSO - avoid around lunch time - this place (inside and out) gets utterly ridiculous as there is a lack of other fast food places in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this Wendy's a few times and received rude service so I was a little hesitant coming here again. The only reason we ever come here is for the chocolate frosty.  I decided to try to drive-thru this time. Ordered the double, single, and of course their frosty. Paid at the next window, drove up and boom. Food was ready. Now that's what I call fast food. Burgers were fresh, juicy and pretty good. Nothing special. Of course we love the creamy frosty. So overall it was good and my wife is happy with her frosty."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Wendy's since it opened way back when I was in high school and it rarely disappoints... for a Wendy's that is.  This location is attached to a Tim Hortons right near Whites and Hwy2 so it's pretty convenient for a fast food stop. It's got plenty of seating space and it can get kind of busy on weekends when everyone is out and about.  As per most fast food establishments, the staff aren't exactly jumping for joy, but they do their jobs and they do them well. I've never had a bad experience at this Wendy's with food or with the staff and I wouldn't dare admit how often I frequent this location. The management is usually visible and they're all very nice, especially the manager who works drive thru, he's always pleasant and quick to get your food out the window to you.  The drive thru is a bit odd to get to but they do a pretty good job of keeping it moving along and I've never gotten an order that was made incorrectly. The food is always fresh, always hot and it usually looks like things do in the commercials. For a Wendy's, this is up there as one of the best I've encountered."}
{"text":"02.08.10  I don't know why I almost always end my trip reviews with a bad one on a fast food restaurant at the airport.  This is no different.  Seriously, I know life sucks when you work at a fast food restaurant at the airport.  If you don't want to work there, maybe you should find another job.  It's definitely not good for business when you have a sour look on your face while you point me to another cashier because you don't feel like taking my order.  I did get an extra piece of nugget.  In your face."}
{"text":"Very nice new Wendy's and that's where it stops. By far the slowest Wendy's in the world. Just came in for a quick lunch and 45 mins later lefty with my order.  No wonder they are struggling financially as a company"}
{"text":"The service was horrible. They messed up my order and when I went back to get the missing food the shift manager got a attitude and precided to slam the food down and called me a lier. I don't think i will be back. Worst service I've had there."}
{"text":"Just left this location without placing an order because the drive thru attendant wouldn't let me finish a sentence without asking if that would complete my order. I was trying to tell her what sauce I wanted with my chicken nuggets when she cut me off to ask if that would complete my order. I still had another meal to order."}
{"text":"A few months ago this place was a hit or miss. Sometimes the nuggets would be cold, and if you were lucky, they'd remember your sauce. But recently this place has been on point. The night crew especially has everything down pat. If Wendy's is tempting you at night, hit the one up on Rancho"}
{"text":"Please properly train your employees on customer service,  and how to enter a coupon.  The manager  on duty took my coupon, and walked off. I'm left standing there....like where did she go? I was the only person in line.  A second employee came clueless on how to ring a coupon.  She called the manager over. The same manager who walked away. The manager said, \"she doesn't know how to ring a coupon.\" I retrieved the coupons from your weekly mail to residential clients. The African-American  manager acted like she didn't want to work today. I ordered two large combos, and two kids meal. I received everything except the second kids meal. I went to the front counter and asked about my order. The cashier asked me \"What are you waiting on ma'am? Why would I be standing there for no reason? I guess I stood there for  my health."}
{"text":"Often very crowded.  Tables tend not to get cleaned regularly.  Garbages tend to be full.  But it is not the staff fault there is just not enough staff to man the restaurant.  I really enjoy the salads. But I tend to order and go."}
{"text":"Wednesday Jan 4th 730 pm crew is The slowest, mute, non customer service having group I have seen. The lady making sandwiches messed up 3 sandwiches including mone during the 30 min frame I was there. No one seems to be in charge. They all should seek other employment because their attitudes were not welcoming to ANY of the customers.. clearly the chain of command here does not enforce customer service skillsI will never return!!!"}
{"text":"I'm baffled at how hard it is to ensure all products being served to customers are not to the upmost quality that can be produced at this facility. The fries were not fried at all and they were still cold. I thought \"Quality is your recipe.\""}
{"text":"While I was waiting in the drive thru for my food, it took a bit longer which I was in no hurry, but the employee all of a sudden gave me a paper full of coupons and then a minute later she gave me a free mini frosty and said my food will be out soon.  Such great service!  Keep it up Wendys!"}
{"text":"I love wendys, but at this location, it was terrible! Only two cars at the drive thru and he kept telling me \"give me one more minute\". I felt like he didn't know the menu. Then they gave me my food without taking my money first which is odd... This location is very slow service. It would be worth it to drive to a different location."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. The service is efficient, the employees are just pleasant and delightful. I enjoy coming regularly, to the point they have memorized my usual order. Definitely would recommend stopping by for a meal."}
{"text":"I like Wendys better than other fast food and I eat here between 4 and 5 times per year.  I have had the same standard order for the last 5 years (across all Wendy's in Ontario) - Junior bacon cheeseburger combo, with no cheese, mustard, ketchup, onions and bacon ONLY.  I even tell it to them in the order that they have to press the buttons on the register.  This location has served me this meal 11 times since I moved to Toronto and my burger has been wrong twice. Once it had cheese, but was otherwise correct, and once they just threw a standard jr bacon cheeseburger in the bag, sick pickles and all.  That's not a *terrible* record... it's certainly no 99.9% accurate guarantee though. I usually expect my food to be incorrect from the drive thru so I think they're operating within the bounds of acceptable.  The good: - I never experience a language barrier at the drive thru - I like the screen that shows you what they're typing in (I think our order accuracy would be less if I couldn't see and shout corrections which I have done 4 of the 11 times) - They have always been short and curt, which I am choosing to recognize as \"efficient\" or \"expedient\" rather than \"unfriendly\"  The bad: - The drive thru here is confusing and you have to weave through the Tim Hortons drive thru traffic - in fact, I am convinced that this parking lot was designed by someone who failed urban planning, but may have excelled in abstract art or replicating cubist masterworks - Over the 5 years I have been eating here, the portions of drink and fries have slowly declined, but the price had stayed the same at $4.19... last week I stopped by and the combo has been discontinued!  You now have to order each item separately from the $1.89 menu* which brought my total to $6.30 - NOT WORTH IT. I haven't really looked into it in detail but I imagine it will be cheaper for me to upgrade to a regular Wendy's burger combo rather than order a-la-carte from the super saver menu (or whatever it's called to imply that I'm frugal, not poor).  Overal, I will definitely come here again but I might have to change my order, so be prepared to wait if you're unlucky enough to be in the car behind me while I ponder all the choices next time.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- *So... in the post-script of this love letter to Dave Thomas... Wendy's has improved their ingredients in the 5 years I enjoyed the $3.99 jr. bacon cheeseburger combo. The bacon was upgraded to an applewood smoked, thicker cut of pork and they have recently debuted \"new fries\" which are freshly cut (whatever that means in the context of... this...) with sea salt (did not taste the sea salt)... so I do UNDERSTAND how you cannot operate on the 8c margin of a $3.99 combo.  But honestly, I didn't ask you to improve your ingredients."}
{"text":"So...a friend and I had been over at Shadyside hospital all day visiting someone. and had a yearning for wendy;s (generally quality food, good prices and we admire the committment to help adoptees) anywhere we got there after the dining room closed. the take out window was open. we found out that even though no sign indicates such, you need a car to use the take out window so after ordering and being told they couldn't give us the food instead of getting the car out of the hospital garage just to use the wendy's take out and then parking again we went to subway. so they lost business and probably had to throw the food away that was already prepared."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way home on vacation. Manager was friendly, service was quick and the food was good and tasted fresh. Customer service was excellent, which always goes a long way for me."}
{"text":"Wish I had something good to write. Ever since the new location in Wexford opened it has been terrible. Orders are wrong, service is slow and the food is stale. On top if that the person taking the order and at the window had an attitude.  Not worth going to this location."}
{"text":"The food there is average. Sometimes the chili has ZERO beans in it.  The biggest problem is EVERY SINGLE time I've gone through the drive through, when we get home the order is wrong.  I won't go to that location any more."}
{"text":"Just another fast food franchise. If you have eaten at any other Wendy's before then you know what all Wendy's taste like. It all comes down to cleanliness and customer service.  This is one of the few locations thy has been lucky to have not been remodeled, still the same layout of when I was a kid.     Employees at this location are nice and friendly. I have seen the same cashier lady for the last 3 years! That says a lot about a location specially since fast food had a high turnover.    Overall the quality of Wendy's has declined for my taste. Prices have increased and portion size has decreased. Buns aren't even warmed anymore like back in the day. If you are missing the taste of a Wendy's burger then this is the place to be, location Is clean and employees are friendly, we were the only ones in the place this evening so it was nice and quiet."}
{"text":"Just went through the drive thru. There is a sign on the window that clearly states if you don't receive a receipt then your meal is free.  Well, after $23 + in food I expect a receipt. After the food was handed to us there was no receipt no where to be found so I asked the cashier where my receipt was and she said it should be in the bag. After taking everything out of the bag and still not finding a receipt I told her there is nothing here. By then she quickly hands me a receipt so I remind her of the free meal policy if no receipt Is given to which she quickly responds \" that's only if you drive away without a receipt\". Really? I had to ask her for the receipt so I think this qualifies. So she expects me to drive away then come inside the store to which she will then probably claim that she did give it to me but I lost it or am probably lying. Talk about false advertisement. If they are not willing to honor what they advertise then they shouldn't advertise it"}
{"text":"Drive thru experience left much to be desired. The young \"adults\" working here were more interested in cracking jokes and smack talking and didn't care to get the order correct. My visit was on 12-11-14 @ 8pm. I was told I had everything in my bags then was stopped and told my bags were missing nuggets. When the woman at the window asked a man in the background how long on the nuggets, she was told 10 minutes. She started laughing and they continued to laugh and joke with each other for the next 60 seconds (with the drive thru window open) while I waited on the 4 nuggets. Awesome, professional way to act in front of customers right?! Ridiculous. So I pull off into the parking lot to check the bags as they made it obvious that they don't give a crap. I was missing several utensils and sour cream and margarine for a potato. I'm not sure who forgot to babysit the drive thru today but it was obvious no management was around. For the price, I'll just go to Chik Fil A in the future, at least they know how to treat customers with respect."}
{"text":"Slowest god damned drive thru service ever. Given them several chances and every time service takes a 10 minute break between car orders and lines reach out to the street. Half the time orders are delivered incorrectly adding even more wait time. Waste of time. So.much for \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"Best fast food breakfast in the valley! Beats McDonalds by a longshot! Worth trying and don't forget to order the #1 combo...Artisan Breakfast Sandwich with Bacon and get the seasoned potatos as your side and coffee. YUM!"}
{"text":"Well my order on the screen said \"ready\" 2167 and I go up to it and they said \"it's not ready yet it's still cooking\" so I was confused how like 3 people before me got there food. I only got a 6pc chicken &fries&I never got my small cup of soda. . She didn't get my order right so what a waste coming to this Wendy's location. But the manager did give me a small  freefry since it took forever. I never got my cup that I order either.. Well I'm never coming here. Thanks wendys"}
{"text":"I had placed a large order through drive though today 9/14 and not only were the employees pleasant but they got the order right down to the sauce packets. Excellent customer service and attention to detail! thank you!"}
{"text":"We got a couple of single hamburger meals and a frosty.  Food was good.   It was clean and the staff was friendly.  No problems."}
{"text":"It's a pretty good Wendy's. I came here while my oil is getting changed at Walmart and was craving a baked potato. I also got a jr bacon cheeseburger off the value menu. Cheap filling and tastes good.  The store is clean and one of the workers brought a missing item they ordered to the table next to me, instead of yelling from the counter and all the employees were smiling. I think that's a great indication of a great restaurant even if it is fast food."}
{"text":"This Wendy's location is horrific. Even after the remodel, the service is terrible. I've only gone here twice in the past few years and both times the drive thru took over 20 minutes. The most recent time took over 30 minutes and I was only the 4th car in line. No one apologized, no one asked me to park and wait for food, nothing. It should not take 20+ minutes in a drive thru every time."}
{"text":"Luke warm hamburger, no unsweetened tea, and no ketchup in the dispenser. I'm curious as to what the employees at this Wendy's are doing all day. Avoid this location or try something else in the area."}
{"text":"This place steals money from customers!!! Just went here for the first time tonight. Drive thru. I ordered and paid for 5 items. Only received 4. Called and the manager said call back in 5 minutes. Called back on 5 minutes and it rang forever. $1.70 stolen from 100 people a day for a year is $62,000.  ???????????????"}
{"text":"My favorite chain - but this location is by far the  Worst Wendy's I've ever frequented  Multiple failures - rubbery chicken sandwich, sloppy burger construction and expired lettuce and tomatoes   They're remodeling right now Hopefully quality control will improve as well  STILL a terribly long wait Messy service"}
{"text":"You don't expect much when you go to Wendy's, despite what their commercials tell you however when I ordered the Caesar Salad I couldn't stop laughing, I wish I was joking but it was lettuce, lemon pepper sauce, and one tomato.   That poor bastard. That lonely tomato. He tried his best to hide under the pile of lettuce but it was no use. What kind of salad has one tomato. I would almost prefer no tomatoes by that point. You couldn't throw in some carrot sticks. I don't even need whole carrots, just some shavings would have been fine.  At least I got a good laugh for my meal at Wendy's."}
{"text":"Middle of afternoon on a Sunday, very few people, I'm 3rd car in drive thru,  and18 minutes later -cold food -REALLY? & no spoon for frosty! That long of a wait your thinking fresh cooked food...nope ice cold fries!! Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and they forgot my 99 cent chicken nugget. I called and the manager said sorry and then put me down for a free 12 piece chicken nugget and frosty. He made the whole trip 100% better for me. Also every time I drive thru they always get my special requests right. This is also the first time they have ever forgotten food. When I go thru they always pet my dog and are social. I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"Great food as always, Brent (Manager) is very polite and efficient. Would recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"This Wendy's rocks! I use the drive-thru and the service is always friendly and extremely fast. They usually have my order bagged by the time I pull up to the 2nd window. Great job staff!"}
{"text":"First of all, I typically don't review fast food chains but I wanted to this time. Mostly due to the host that took our order, Jacqueline. She was very kind and went out of her way to be accomadating and friendly. So here I am paying it forward.  I got the triple burger and it came out hot and juicy. Didn't have high expectations coming in so this was great visit."}
{"text":"This is the cleaner, more friendly fast food place you'll find in town. The staff was friendly, place was well designed and regularly cleaned. Food, well, it's a fast food place, Wendy's is doing their best."}
{"text":"Dirty,dirty,dirty, staff was all young and immature. Dinning room was flithy food on all tables. And my burger was half done and bun was cold..yes really cold! Dont bother this location..sucks"}
{"text":"Always a long wait here. Drive thru is always a 10 minute journey. Once I saw the drive thru line about 10 cars deep and thought I would just go in and it would be faster, nope! I was wrong. Despite being the only one in line and only ordered a wrap and a drink, it still took at least 10 mins. Everyone was very nice, but the service was at a snails pace."}
{"text":"Seriously!  This is now the third time I've had a terrible experience with the staff at this location!  How difficult is it to be polite?!? It's their job!  Next time it happens, I'm speaking to the manager."}
{"text":"Salad late at night- No greasy slop for bedtime. Light and refreshing.   Okay, so my Haiku skills suck, so next time I'll figure out a creative rap that can take those youtube suckas to the cleaners.   In seriousness, a salad (Pecan Apple Chicken Salad) and a small frosty hits the spot  at 1am.   Sometimes grease shouldn't be king of the night, but something a bit lighter and easy on the stomach so I can go to bed."}
{"text":"This Wendy's was really good and I don't even like Wendy's. The fries weren't even soggy, Nice work."}
{"text":"Came about 2:30 March 19th. Whoever's taking orders at drive through needs to get in the back or go clean the bathroom or something. Horrible customer service skills. unfriendly, dismissive. Makes me not want to come back. Girl in the first window was nice."}
{"text":"How far Wendy's has fallen from what it once was. Fresh burgers cooked to order. Dave insisted on it.   Just had a Single, and the burger patty was dry and room temperature. Just like McD. Fries were hot and fresh .... and only halfway cooked. Grab a few and they hang down limp. Whatever."}
{"text":"Short staffed, manager has no leadership and customer service skills. Tomatoes and onions were rotten, order was wrong. Why contact them when all I heard,  we are short  no apologies. Tried contacting customer service and well I was told that they would pass it along, never heard back and I will never go back. Gave a one star because I had to give one."}
{"text":"What happened to this Wendy's?! It used to be the quickest in town and had the best workers... now it's the absolute slowest!  I have waited at the drive thru order box for 5 minutes before and no one ever answered it.  Today I ordered inside and the incompetent workers lost our order and we were the only ones inside.  It took 13 minutes to even get our order put in the register... which was wrong every single time she put it in... she gave me my \"natural\" lemonade without any ice and when I asked for ice she told me it was in the machine... for one... how can I put ice in it if you filled the whole cup and why didn't you put ice in it when u filled it?? Which she also put in the wrong kind of cup... a guy came in after us and ordered a salad... and waited for 20 minutes... 20 minutes!  For a premade salad!  The next guy ordered just two plain patties and was told it was $8!  When in actuality it was like $1.00!  I'm not sure what's going on there but I'm done with this location."}
{"text":"Every time I order grilled chicken it's always undercooked. Decided to give it another try and this time I find a long hair in my sandwich! I will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Just ordered food here. Waited in line for 5+ mins, waiting for only one order. And got sent to wait out in front for about another 5 mins."}
{"text":"Typical Wendy's fare.  However, nowhere to sit.  And don't even think about trying to sit at the Round Table Pizza next door as the wolves will run you off.  Take your Classic Single on the airplane and make your row-mates jealous.  Employees?  Meh."}
{"text":"This is literally the worst Wendy's ever. Every single time I've been here they forget something, and always forget the sauce. They have never remembered the sauce even when I reminded them at the window (because I hadn't received the sauce the last few times). They also forget whatever extras you might need: spoons or straws. Last time I checked my bag before driving off and asked for the sauce and the second straw. Got the sauce. Asked for the straw, again. Girl said, \"Yeah yeah your food is coming.\" What? Dude I was a teenager not that long ago, and even I didn't cop that big of an attitude. Then a guy came up and handed me the other bag with my boyfriend's food and shut the window and walked away. Never got the freaking straw. And the fries always taste old."}
{"text":"Used to love this location, but not anymore. Ordered 2 grilled chicken wraps, nuggets, and a value fries. The drive thru made me pull up to the front door while they made the food. When the food arrived more than 5 minutes later, all but the nuggets were ice cold. Waited another 7 minutes for them to fix it. After pulling back around to the drive-thru window, I was told they were out of grilled chicken. I was also not offered a refund. Drove away with $3 worth of food that I paid almost $8 for. Will definitely be complaining to corporate. Also won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Way over priced but that's what you get when you buy anything at McCarran Airport. The staff is friendly, and I receive my food in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I don't understand these poor reviews, you really can't go wrong with the ol spicy chicken sandwich combo meal!!!!"}
{"text":"I witnessed the cashier Beth pick up my chicken nuggets with her fingers and place them in the cardboard container after she took my money. I called her out on it and she acted like it wasn't wrong to do. This place is disgusting and I will never be back."}
{"text":"Super fast service. Delicious mushroom bacon burger. Fries were good. DEFINITELY better than the Wendy's by my house on sunset and greenvalley area! As far as Wendy's and fast food goes, I'm giving it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Wendy's in over 5 years, but I was remembering the days when I'd hit this place up for their Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers in high school.  Back then they were 99 cents apiece!  This place was clean and I ordered the burger along with a spicy chicken sandwich.   The burger was 2.19 and the chicken sandwich was around 5 bucks. Either my tastebuds have changed a bit, or the burgers have.  Not as good as I remember.  They forgot the bacon so I ended up getting a side of it to put on.  Was glad I tried this stuff again after so long, but probably will wait another 5 years or more before voluntary heading here sober."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location for awhile because I do not live near there. I stopped by here today on my way to an appointment and was assisted by the nicest young man at the window. He had the best personality for his age and was very respectful.  It's nice to go somewhere and have a minor conversation that didn't involve your total, here's your food and lucky to get a thank you.  We need more young adults that know what customer service is like him."}
{"text":"IDK. I see a lot of negative reviews but I thought I had a nice experience. First of all, yeah, I'm biased. You give me a Carolina Classic and a medium Dr. Pepper in my hands and I'm a happy man. But seriously, not too long of a line, friendly guy behind the counter, \"fast\" food, full but not too loud crowd, walked-so-no-need-to-park, and so I was happy with my lunch today. As for the sandwiches itself, it was just as good as the first one I had. Hey, it got me through the whole trip to Target. And mattress firm. Then I had to go get a smoothie but you know it was a hot day."}
{"text":"My Grandson loves it says burgers are bigger and better then other fast food places but I find the price you pay for a meal you could go to a restaurant and get full service for the same price or less."}
{"text":"Why am I reviewing Wendy's? Because the double i just got was the best burger I've had in a while, and i eat a lot of burgers. The lemonade they served me only had enough ice to make it cools, instead of wasting half the space with ice. The fries were hot and perfectly salted. This is the experience i want with fast food! Thank you for getting it right!"}
{"text":"1 star is the lowest I could give. I've been at he hospital with my fiancé all day so I yelped the nearest fast food location and this establishment popped up. I was in the drive thru waiting to order my food and decided to read the previous reviews to base how my extra details needed to complete my order. Reading the reviews let me needing to add that my Spicy Chicken sandwich and fry needed to be made fresh. The employee on the receiving side completely ignored me the entire time and continue to cut me off telling me to pull forward when I asked if she heard my order correctly. After asking twice I gave up trying to communicate with her and proceeded to pull forward as I was rudely instructed to do. Once I got the window the employee continued to ignore me for about 2 minutes and then finally decided to take my card and said, \"I hope you plan to wait about 6 minutes since you want your food fresh\". Based on the past reviews I didn't hesitate to say, \"no problem, I don't mind the wait\". She handed me my card back and I pulled forward to the next window. Upon arriving to the window, two other employees said for me to pull forward and they would bring my fresh food out to me, I waited for about 3 minutes and my food was delivered to my car and I proceeded to drive back to the hospital. Once I parked, I opened my bag and was amazed at how fresh and juicy the sandwich was. I went in for my 3rd bite and notice the sandwich was completely raw and damn near had a heart beat. This location needs to be completely burned to the ground and revamped."}
{"text":"I stopped in through their drive through today and ordered for myself, my husband and my son. They forgot my sons chicken nuggets and our food was \"warm\" not pipping hot like it usually is when i come here for lunch. Not sure what happpened. I will call it in and update my review once I speak to a manager.   Otherwise, for those coming here, beware of the homeless and sketchy characters that hang out. Thats normal for this side of town. Its behind the strip to its notorious for loiters. I would suggest ordering via drive thru and taking your food back to your home or hotel.   Wendy's has great food and this is a high grossing location BUT for its customers it may not be so great to visit after dark."}
{"text":"Asked for two orders of spicy chicken nuggets and got regular, also did not receive the croutons that come with the salad. Also asked for a side of mayonnaise that they didn't put in the bag.  So basically my whole order was bad. Spent money on something that I didn't want or didn't get."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's ever. Extremely slow!!! It took me 30 min to get two sandwiches and fries. That's not fast food."}
{"text":"It's in the Union and it's frickin expensive. My gawd."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst  Wendy's I've ever been to. First off, the prices for the value menu are just too high. When you go to a fast food place, it's quite customary for all items on the value menu to be between $1 and $2. The lowest priced item on the value menu was $1.50. Most items on it were $2.50.   There was only one customer in front of me but service was as slow as taking a highly constipated dump."}
{"text":"So I come in here and it seems that the boss is displeased with the way things are running and is voicing her displeasure to their workers. Alright, awkward. Despite its recent opening, this seems like your standard fare of Wendy's."}
{"text":"I come here often but this time today.  My chicken was very grimy and tasted old and disgusting.  I actually drove back to the store and asked for another.  The person at the drive through gave me another one but once again grimy.  They usually taste good, but this time very bad.  I didn't even eat the second one.  It's tossed in the trash.  Now I have no lunch.  Yuck!"}
{"text":"It is rare that I give a negative review of anywhere, especially not a fast food place. I knew I would be waiting forever to get food here but there are really no other convenient options close to my home. But I got home to discover my very simple order was not right at all- I was missing my two orders of nuggets completely and was given a sour cream and chives baked potato instead of the broccoli and cheese one I ordered. I was sitting for 5 minutes at the speaker just waiting to give my order.  Update: my wife tried to go to the restaurant to fix this and even though the dining room hours are posted until midnight the dining room was closed before 11:00pm"}
{"text":"Served nearly frozen inedible chicken sandwich, not to forget the crazy assortment of raw and burned fries.  Can easily say I'm never going back and neither should you."}
{"text":"Their ranch is TRASH. T R A S H. And one ranch per nugget?! Outrageous. And why the odd numbers of nuggs I usually get 20 but I had to get in multiples of 6 for 18. Also ur machine is broken. And the cashier took my name down as \"Lorie\". my name is Lauren."}
{"text":"I actually got food poisoning a couple years back from eating their chicken sandwich.   Stay  away!"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.   This Wendy's is the closest one to my workplace. I have never been inside. I typically go through the drive-thru.   I continued my streak by visiting the drive-thru recently. It has been months since I dropped by. Apparently, someone had run over the speaker box. It was propped up by a bin and some bag.   Sure enough, the sign on the speaker box said to say hi, as the speaker doesn't work too well. Hope it gets fixed soon. I ordered a bacon portabello mushroom burger on brioche, with chili and a Diet Coke. It is my favourite burger at Wendy's, but is available once a year.   The food was yummy. Service was prompt. All went smoothly.   (230)"}
{"text":"After seeing the Duran Duran show, I drove home. This Wendy's is the closest one by my home.   I was hoping to get an order of chili cheese nachos.   Guess what? I got there at 00:30 and it had closed at midnight. The hours aren't great. I feel for those doing rotating shift work, who need a bite to eat.   I generally don't go to this Wendy's. The parking lot is poorly designed and is just plain dangerous, especially when there is both a Wendy's and a Tim Hortons with tons of folks visiting them. I have another reason to not visit this Wendy's when I am out late and have hunger pangs!  I recall the \"eat great, even late\" slogan years ago. I realize why it was dropped.   Instead, I drove over to a 24-hour McDonald's and got some food.   (168)"}
{"text":"I hit the drive-thru whenever I visit this location. The food is good for a Wendy's.   The folks at the window could be more friendly. One guy said, \"$8.80! First window!\" First, a complete sentence would be great. It also doesn't hurt to say 'please' to a customer. It would make the experience more pleasant.   Other than that, you get your food fast."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Wendy's one day. It's on my way home.   I ordered the half-size apple chicken salad and a small Diet Coke. I went through the drive-thru. I was told to visit the first window.   What happens when you approach the first window and no one appears for a minute? It happened to me. I pulled up to the second window.   Of course, the guy looked at me as if I were crazy. I explained that no one was there at the first window. I reversed my car to the first window. Thank goodness the drive-thru doesn't curve between the two windows.   I told the guy that no one was there. There was a thirty-second delay with his answer (I guess that being away is a normal thing for him) before he apologized. I finally paid.   I proceeded to get my food at the second window. Finally!  The salad had blue cheese. I didn't feel like having it, so I carefully took them out. The salad was good, although I still like the taco supremo is better.   I may come back here again when someone is present at the first window. I'll stick to my usual Wendy's location again.   (139)"}
{"text":"On Monday night, I drove home from work in a snowstorm. Normally, I backroad it home. It sounds crazy, considering that I commute between Markham and Mississauga. Instead, I took the 407 home.   The problem is that I can't grab dinner when I'm on the 407. I exited at Woodbine.   I saw this Wendy's. It has been ages since I was last here. I swung in and hit the drive-thru.   This location has a Tim Horton's next door. Both were designed to accommodate drive-thru customer more than dine-in folks.   There were few folks there. I pulled up and ordered a bacon deluxe burger. I got chili and a Diet Coke to complete my combo.   Staff are extremely efficient. I paid and got my food without a wait. I'm here. I'm gone!  The downside was that there was an accident at Denison and Birchmount. My commute was incredibly long. It was stop and go. I was so hungry that I ate my entire dinner in my car.   My burger was yummy. At first, I touched the bun. It felt cold. I thought that the traffic standstill had caused my food to go cold. Nope. Underneath the bun were the crispy lettuce, onions, ketchup, pickles, and such. All was fine.   I took a bite. Yummy! My burger was still pretty warm. The bacon hit the spot.   Eating chili requires being at a full stop. I had many of those. It was comforting and delicious.   My Diet Coke washed everything down.   Thank goodness for Wendy's. Had I not stopped by to grab dinner, I would have eaten my steering wheel instead.   (39)"}
{"text":"I write this review as I sit in the drive through line. Was the fourth car in line and have been sitting here for 15 minutes. Now I wait at the menu with no response.... SUPER SLOW SERVICE! Won't be back. That's for sure."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Wendy's in a very long time. I used to love going to Wendy's as a kid.  My visit via the drive-thru was friendly enough. Nice staff member at the window. Fast service.  The food however. Ugh. First off I ordered a diet Coke and got a regular Coke. The burger was decent but there are better burgers at other fast-food restaurants now. The fries must have been sitting around for a while. They weren't very hot and were pretty soft.  Not sure I have a reason to go back again after this experience. I didn't go back and complain since I was on my way home and tired and didn't feel like wasting my time. I just through out the soda and most of the fries."}
{"text":"Wendy's at 929 N Arizona Ave Gilbert, AZ  85233 United States. Screwed up my order twice and didn't give me a receipt nor apologize and I still left with wrong food! Got home to realize there are ingredients on there that I specifically asked to leave off because of allergies. I tried calling store but no answer. I'm out almost $10 for my large combo with soggy fries and a sandwich I cant eat. Employees acted inconvenienced and irritated when I asked them to fix issue"}
{"text":"With two Wendy's the same distance from home, I prefer this one. Service is always a 10, the workers I've encountered seem happy to be there. Plus, the burgers and fries taste fresher than the other location, on Eastern."}
{"text":"My husband and I were at the Paradise Valley Mall yesterday, and instead of eating at the food court; we chose Wendy's. This Wendy's is gorgeous aesthetically, all the way down to the couch and fake fireplace! It really gives you that warm and cozy feeling!  The food offerings are great too! Not only does it offer all your Wendy's favorites, but they also have fresh baked goods. This includes cookies brownies, pieces of pie, and rolls. Want to spice up the taste of your soft drink? This is the place to do it! They offer coke products, but you can choose a variety of flavors to add, like cherry, peach, orange, raspberry or vanilla. I chose to have my usual ice tea with Splenda while my husband picked Raspberry Coke. It was enjoyed immensely!  Both of us ordered our favorite burgers, the baconator. He likes to add  tomato and extra cheese. I prefer mine with mustard, ketchup and pickle only. What happens at this point determined the three star rating. His burger did not have extra cheese which of course costs extra.   We take the receipt up to the counter and are immediately told that it does have extra cheese. By looking at my burger, we can tell this is not true. My husband goes up to the counter again, and this time he is handed a cold  piece of cheese on a disposable tray. He decides to help me eat before returning a third time!  This time the manager asks what the problem is. We explain that he added tomato and extra cheese. She says, \"did they not add tomato?\" If you looked at the sandwich with tomato and the slice of unmelted cheese, the tomato was obviously not the issue. Finally, she put two and two together and remade his sandwich. She also reminded the employees that they cook the burgers to order and gave me a free chocolate frosty for the inconvenience!  The bottom line is this Wendy's is classy, but needs to remember the customer is always right!"}
{"text":"I went to this Wendys on my lunch break and asked for 2 cheesy cheese burgers and a frosty. It said 2 jr bacon cheese burgers on the menu and O asked if they were the cheesy cheeseburgers at the window and during ordering. I was told yes. I opened my bag and there was 2 jr. Bacon cheeseburgers. Not satisfied. Wasting my time on my lunch break. Went back because they over charged me and I had to go a second time. Manager did not seem sympathetic and seemed like she cared more about her sales and drive thru times than correct orders and customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is like a time warp, back to an era before customer service was invented In fact in some ways I wonder if this place is a burger joint that just happens to share the name Wendy's. The food is WAY off. Fries cold and heavy. No bacon available tonight.... Also no honey mustard. Both of which are very unusual omissions. Even the ketchup packets tasted weird.... They had a distinctive fruity taste. The drive through girl even made disparaging remarks about the state of the restaurant. Altogether unusual experience."}
{"text":"This is the best Wendy's I've been too especially considering the location. The service is always quick, the service is always great and the food is always fresh. I've been multiple time because my husband is gluten free and the chili is always his go too! Each time we've been here the people running the drive thru are extra friendly. Also two words frosty & french fries!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest drive through ever. I have been sitting in line for 15 minutes have not gotten to place an order and only had two cars in front of me!"}
{"text":"Fresh food Fast customer service Friendly  I'm not sure why it has a low rating, but this location has been one of the better Wendy's I have been to."}
{"text":"There are a ton of fast food places in Charlotte.  It's nice to find one for a change that seems to know what its doing for a change.  I've gone there a few times for the lunch rush and yes there is a long line but each time it moves very quickly.  Contrast that to the Wendy's on Charlottetowne Ave which even when there's half the traffic always moves at least twice as slow.  Never a problem with my order including special request orders.  For the negative reviews here, check the date on them.  At least from my experience they've gotten their act together since then.  Either way always try to be mindful of how difficult fast food work is and mindful that these employees don't get paid very much for what they do before leaving a bad fast food review."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service. Waited in line for 15 minutes before we ended up leaving and going to McDonalds across the street. Slowest Wendy's ever."}
{"text":"Food is what you'd expect at a fast food chain.  I'm partial to JBCs after the gym sometimes. If you are lucky, you'll get polite service. If you are not, you'll get a cashier who whistles at you to get your attention even though you're about to give you order and are looking at him. True story."}
{"text":"Cold food. Cheese wasn't melted. Cold staff. Barely acknowledged me.  Cold air. AC is a nice touch. Clean washrooms, at least. That is the 2 stars.  Avoid if looking to consume food or drink."}
{"text":"I was hoping to get some nostalgia high from returning to wendy who I hadn't seen in over a year, you know like an old high school ex... she turned out to be an ex mother in law instead...  The fries were abundant and delicious, they beat the clowns fries any day.  But that burger, that I always remembered and thought was supposed to be so good... what a let down...  Parking decent,  restaurant and washrooms were clean... staff were quick... I wasn't full after my meal and gave it a 3(I was left hungry) but on second thought, pumped it to a 4."}
{"text":"For some reason I always meet strange people eating at this Wendy's. It is like this location attracts the odd balls which is I guess why I end up there sometime too."}
{"text":"Wendy's has the worst food of almost any fast food restaurant.  Their fries used to be good, but not so much anymore.  Their burgers are overly salty, their breakfast is terrible.  The Frosty is the only edible thing there.  Yuck."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru and Brandon I really hope you don't make more than $7.25. I got shushed when I had to ask a question while getting my food before leaving, and you didn't even give me a spoon for my frosty guy. Killed my vibe."}
{"text":"Service is inconsistent but I like the food over the other fast food chains. I really wish they could get the floors clean so they're not sticky. I think it's their spiffy new soda fountains, but the floors are really sticky"}
{"text":"Literally the worst wendy's i have ever been to. We waited 20 minutes in their drive through for them to charge us twice, once for our meal and second for someone else's meal because they said the transaction didn't go through. Then when we checked our bags they didn't give us the correct order. The burgers were cold and soggy like they were sitting in the bag for a while, the fries were wet, i dont wanna know why. And then when we called them to try and get our money back since we were charged twice it took a month to get a call back and they said we have to go in to the location to get our money back when we live 2 hours away from there. Theres other fast food in the area, avoid this wendy's."}
{"text":"Wow! Horrible customer service! One employee literally did not move from holding the wall up (in the dining area) the entire 30 minutes I had lunch there. Another milled about the line area and drink area doing nothing except getting in my way. Stood at front counter with everyone looking at me but no one willing to take my order or even pronounce to their coworkers that someone was waiting. Order didn't get taken until the manager noticed. This is why a fast food employee making $15 an hour is a joke and everyone knows it. The only people who think they deserve $15 an hour are the ones working fast-food. I understand a kid working fast-food not being totally enthusiastic about their job, but an adult? Yes, that's why you are working at Wendy's at the age of 35, cause your work ethic sucks and you are basically unemployable."}
{"text":"Went this Sunday and the order time took a while. It was a Sunday night and it was raining, so maybe they were expecting it to be slower and they had less people, but it took over 10-15 minutes to get to the window and then even took a while to get the food. The cashier didn't apologize at all and acted like nothing happened and her sweatshirt she was wearing looked gross and unsanitary on the sleeves. Very disappointed in this Wendy's , I wish they would work on their speed and customer service."}
{"text":"This location is terrible.  We love Wendy's.  This location is horrible.  Absolutely the worst fast food experience we have ever had EVER!!!   Drive through orders are always wrong, inside is always dirty, bathrooms are filthy  Today my wife went through the drive thru and all the orders were wrong.  Fries weren't cooked . I wanted to call the restaurant but my wife said they never gave her a receipt. I looked up the restaurant on the internet. Called the number 3 times and no one answered.  I finally called the Wendy's website and spoke to someone about all of this.   I have never made a call like that ever.  I really like Wendy's food but this location. Is absolutely the worst experience I have ever had in a fast food restaurant in my entire life.   This isn't a one time experience.  This location is close to my house and I've been going there frequently over time.   It has steadily gotten worse  The owner needs to clean house and start over. Zero stars !!!  I hope the owner can fix all these issues !!!"}
{"text":"First off, it's Wendy's. Either you like their food or you don't but either way it's supposed to be the same at every location so I'm nor reviewing the food.   First up, tons of parking. It's a very busy location here and I have never had an issue finding a good parking spot. Inside you will find loads of seating. I fact this place is almost a large as some of the oases you find on the major highways. This one is paired with a Tims and has a drive through for each.   The only issue I find is that the order desk is a part of the walkway to Tims so it's not your typical Canadian queue so be a bit bold and ask for someone to take your order.  If you wait they may never notice you."}
{"text":"Everyone takes to Yelp to complain about fast food visits, but rarely compliment. I work around the corner from this Wendys and frequent this location, let me say that this is a well trained and managed staff. Someone is always cleaning. The lines move very quickly, and the food is what you would expect. After only a few visits the manager and select staff have memorized my order and name. Wendy's is my favorite fast food and I'll admit there are some poorly run locations.  This is one of the best."}
{"text":"Hey Parker. Call me an idiot and block me from responding.  Hiding behind a computer. And fuck Yelp. It hurts more businesses than it helps."}
{"text":"Best Wendy's I've been to. Always fast service, nice employees, & hot food. What else could one ask for? I absolutely love this Wendy's, I recommend all other Wendy's lovers come here."}
{"text":"I've been to many Wendy's all over the US-none as bad as this one! Horrible customer service, Garbages over flowing, and a bunch of teenagers running the show with all their friends coming in for food! Corporate should be embarrassed to put their name to this establishment! Time to fire the entire crew and start over!"}
{"text":"Drive thru open late!! The drive thru is always super efficient! I do not think I have ever been inside this particular store, but the outside is always clean."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is NOT open until 1:00am. We arrived at the drive-thru at 12:05 on a Wednesday night (well, Thursday morning) and although all the lights were on, an automated message at the drive-thru said they were closed. I think they probably closed at midnight.  I don't know if the restaurant hours on Yelp are posted by the store, but the incorrect info is why I gave it only one star."}
{"text":"Worst wendy's I have ever been to in my travels all over the USA. Normally Wendy's is at the top of my fast food list. This particular location is HORRIBLE. AVOID !!!"}
{"text":"One of the worst Wendy's I have ever been to. Arrived approximately 6:00pm today. Ordered meal ok. But the kitchen was totally disorganized! The left hand did not know what the right hand was doing. During their confusion one of the workers swiped my order receipt off the counter and walked off with. Now I am unable to go on the company website to write a review. After waiting 15 minutes for my order and pointing out where parts of my order were left off to the side and how disorganized they all were I was greeted with an attitude by someone in a black uniformed who acted like they were in charge. Demanded that I repeat my order because they had know idea what it was."}
{"text":"Why review a Wendy's, you may ask? What's to know about this widespread fast food chain, or this location, at Lawrence west of Dufferin? Believe it or not, I'm reviewing their new soft drink machine.  This location is one of the first in Canada to get a Coke Freestyle machine.  It has so many choices of soft drinks, plus \"flavour shots\" you can add at no extra charge, that one middle aged man grumbled because he was bewildered (probably the same kind of guy who hates ATMs ;) I however am an enthusiastic geek, and I happily pressed for ice, type of soft drink and flavour, and went back twice. How can you resist trying vanilla, raspberry, orange, grape or lime cola or Sprite or whatever, I literally can't remember all the options.  You can order all the flavours diet or regular.  You really gotta try the Freestyle machine so Coke will install them at more restaurant locations.  YELP: Please link this business to my review dated June 11, 2012 (first to review) You erroneously linked it with another Wendy's location at 2013 Lawrence Ave. W which I also reviewed. It was NOT a review update, these were 2 different Wendy's locations! Please correct this ASAP."}
{"text":"The Weston Wendy's / Tim Horton's has been completely renovated, so it merits a new review. The new chairs & tables are far more spacious than the old cramped fast food attached chair & tables which preceded them. There's a new CP24 TV screen w/news/weather in the centre and a fake fireplace for decoration underneath it. The Tim Horton's section has the new clearly marked circular lighted ordering stations which should help line-ups move more quickly. The washrooms have more stalls, 3 sinks instead of one, a bigger mirror and new flooring. There is a mustard & ketchup station with push buttons slightly to the left of the Wendy's ordering counter, but salt, pepper and plastic cutlery are no longer longer available at this station; you have to ask counter staff for those items, which is NOT IMO an improvement, given this is a very busy restaurant all the time, always line ups, as we who live in Weston have few dining options ;_; (For God's sake, food franchises & restaurant chains, take pity on Weston - Lawrence & open up some businesses here!) Proletariat Pandora out :P"}
{"text":"Usually this is a good location. I actually drive out of my way past another wendys to get to this one. My chili was not hot nor was the container filled. My nuggets were old and stale. Very disappointed after this visit."}
{"text":"Like a few other chains in the vicinity, considering it's in Greentree/Mt. Lebanon/Scott Township (???) one would think you'd be in for a superior fast food experience. Instead, this basic (throwback?) Redhead stronghold offers few of the newer Wendy's menu items such as cookies and brownies and employs some obviously unhappy employees who will fill your Frosty or soft drink cups only halfway because properly completing a serving is just too much hassle. Move along and avoid or risk falling into a malaise over the state of our evil economic system.   P.S. I've been here several times. A masochist am I?   P.P.S. The food is up to the usual corporate standards. I just don't like feeling as if I'm imposing on someone for stopping in.  P.P.P.S. Raise the minimum wage."}
{"text":"So, prior to a trip to the Mart of Walls (ugh), Kay insisted we find a Wendy's (and later a Handel's since she 'needed' ice cream) just so she could sample Ginger's new Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger. I ordered one too for the frack of it.   The bun doesn't taste at all like a pretzel but rather like a standard white bread bun dressed up to physically resemble a pretzel. No pretzel is that spongy. The honey mustard sauce and the melted cheddar turned the dressed-up burger into a colossal mess, both of them failing to mask the dryness of the beef. The colorful lettuce was nice, though.   Don't expect me to sing any love songs to Wendy or her new menu item."}
{"text":"The service at this Wendy's can be choppy, but last night it was ever so gracious. The young woman that took our drive-thru order gave us desserts at no charge (their excellent Cinna-middles and chocolate chip cookies) after our first choice (brownies) had been completely depleted due to customer demand.   I'm still enjoying Wendy's standard menu items, particularly the new, improved Hot 'N Juicy burger.   P.S. Fast food workers, along with all others, deserve a hefty pay raise...  https://www.commondreams.org/view/2013/08/29-7"}
{"text":"\"A GRIM AND FROSTBITTEN KINGDOM\"  Part 3.  With nowhere else to go for the time being, we abandoned the Kaymobile and went to Wendy's for nourishment and shelter.   Man, dig them fancy new fries. They purport to be fresh cut, with sea salt yet! But that's not the reason for the 5 stars. The reason for that lies in their hospitality and kindness. As we ate, we made various phone calls, plotting our next move and were allowed to stay as long as we needed. When we decided that we were going to have to take a pair of buses to a hotel over in the South Side, the manager broke a $20 for me without complaint and wished us well.   Everyone from hipsters to local yokels to an adult thumbsucker (I saw one, I swear...) stared in awe at my Immortal shirt though...  http://www.cmdistro.com/images/xlarge/PKG000067.jpg  And then it was back into the wintry night, uncertainty swirling in the air along with the snowflakes. Would we make it to safety, dryness, and warmth? Or would Jack Frost entomb us in ice?"}
{"text":"Kudos are in order to the Redhead's servants for letting me use Her restroom before a concert the other night since Mama Pepino wouldn't allow me to use hers. Kay also thanks the staff for the small Frosty she made me buy since I was \"going there anyway.\"  The folks at Mama Pepino's thought it was funny too."}
{"text":"Just picked a a single cheese with everything and 2 Frosty's. When I got home and opened the sandwich, the condiments were all over the wrapper and the burger was burned. At least the dogs got to eat. This Wendy's used to be good. Too many other fast food places. Doubt I'll  be back."}
{"text":"Someone please buy these kids who open this place a watch. They seem to think the hours are a suggestion If I ran this place they would have 2 choices show up to work and open on time or go find a new job. Service at this location has gone steadily downhill over the last few years to the point where it is simply inexcusable. They are one of 3 restaurants inside of security at terminal 2 and they have a captive audience so I guess there is not much that can be done you can eat at this crappy place or one of the other 2 crappy places."}
{"text":"The people who work there cannot tell a chicken sandwich from a burger. this place will mess up your order every time. Avoid this Wendy's location whenever possible I wish I could leave zero stars."}
{"text":"Came through with my family about 8pm on a Sunday night. Drive through cashier couldn't take order through speaker so had us drive up to window. Told us there were no salads available due to no lettuce. Took over 10 minutes to take and receive order at window. I decided to jump out and use bathroom while waiting, and both stalls were without toilet paper. I let the manager know who was sitting at a table doing paperwork and she looked annoyed. On top of that, the grilled chicken sandwich was cold."}
{"text":"No bueno"}
{"text":"The food is good. The specialty lemonades and tees are usually mixed at the proper ratios. Mistakes are fairly rare but it's worth checkin your food before you leave if using the drive through. The one major issue with this Wendy's is it's ridiculously over complicated and unnecessary parking lot and drive through layout. Not only does it result in wasted space and not enough parking spots, but the radii of the corners and lanes are far too tight for most cars to make without a 3 point turn. It's a brand new building and unfortunately will need renovation soon. Otherwise a good Wendy's with friendly staff."}
{"text":"The gentleman who took my order was very nice and courteous. However I canceled my order after seeing one of the food preparers wipe her nose one her sleeve. IWendy's, please advise workers about proper food sanitation, preparation and service."}
{"text":"Best Wendy's in the area.  They handle long lunch lines well, service is fast & friendly, and the food is made to order.    Often, when the line gets long around noon or 1pm, they have someone take orders on paper to speed up the process at the pay window.  Very efficient.    I eat here often enough they know how like the same one or two things and I always get greeted with a smile.    The dinning room is generally clean, with consistently clean tables.  The location is pretty convenient to I85.    The only weird thing is the parking lot- often if there is a line at the drive up window, drivers will attempt to go the wrong way through the one-way lot."}
{"text":"Let's face it- it's a Wendy's.  You know what the menu is, and what to expect.  Really, all you can review is the service, which is pretty bad here.    My order has been consistently wrong here.  When I get a salad, or a sandwich with lettuce, the lettuce is not fresh.  The service is rather poor.  Specifically, it takes noticeably longer to get food at this location, and often, the staff aren't making sure they are making food to order.    Additionally (and this may seem like a strange note) the line rails leading up to order in the restaurant are not set like every other Wendy's.  It doesn't use the space well, and it's not clear where to stand.   My office very close to this location, yet I go out of my way to the Wendy's at 2801 Boyer Street instead.  They have much better service."}
{"text":"Almost everything that could go wrong went wrong. I visited Wendy's on a cool night strictly for a cup of chili. Of course they have no chili. My friend orders a \"value\" fry. We get up to the first window and he charges me for a small fry. So they corrected that. Then we get to the second window and the guy ask me if I ordered a drink No sir. He ask me what I ordered and I tell him the value fry. So they gave me a large fry to make up for the lack of service. Overall, nothing awful. They just need to get it together."}
{"text":"I gave it a 1 because you cant give half a star.  They are the rudest bunch of people I've ever come in contact with,  yes it's fast food but these people don't even greet you with a smile.  There's no thank you there's no  you're welcome. I was asked in drive thru, \" What do you want...what else....second window. Come to find out it was the manager working the window. Geez, what an example he's setting"}
{"text":"It is with great sadness that I report that Wendy's has discontinued their baked sweet potato. After judging a round of Ellis Icon, I arrived late last night for my fourth meal and made this brutal discovery. The staff was openly apologetic, which I thought was kind. I have expressed my disappointment via Twitter, and to her credit, Wendy replied promptly that there is hope she will bring it back. Until then, I will have to be satisfied with its colorless cousin. After experiencing the sweet, it just isn't the same.   If you need a less than noble cause, let Wendy know that you too like it sweet."}
{"text":"Oh my.  Stopped in for a quick bite on my lunch break.  It took 15 minutes to move the line to take my order.  Then another 15 minutes to get my food.  My lunch was over and the food was cold by the time I got it!  Super slow service and lots of confusion around what the kids behind the counter should be doing.  Sounds like some serious training or process evaluation is needed at this Wendy's location."}
{"text":"Bought me a large strawberry lemonade...I should've gotten a medium.  It was really good though.  Ordered large fries.  I thought I'd eat some and save some for later.  Nope, I ate the whole thing at one sitting; the fries were too healthy and not that great.  I asked the cashier for a handful of ketchup.  She told me I couldn't.  Turned out to be a mean joke lol.  And Vegas food prices are ridiculously expensive."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the cashier, Chris, was a lot of funThe restrauant is clean inside and out. We celebrated my husband's birthday here because Wendy's is his favorite!!we really had a great time."}
{"text":"The order was completed perfectly.  My order was hot and very good.  The inside and outside of the restrauant is very clean and attractive and the restrooms are clean. We  also received service with a warm greeting and smile from Ryan. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant doubles with Tim's. Pretty decent burgers. I do however find they salt their fries a bit to much good point the use sea salt and not far from home. Still better quality burger than McDonalds at least I think and trio less than a Big Mac trio. Service at this restaurant always been friendly."}
{"text":"I've grown up down the street from this Wendy's my whole life. They closed it down for a couple months to remodel... honestly I wish they had just left it the way it was. The remodel has brought in horrible disrespectful employees... and the food sucks now."}
{"text":"I ordered a medium fries to go...takes 10 minutes...there were 4 people in the back and the manager was just standing around. For the sake of the school year..I hope they pick it up"}
{"text":"They generally give quick, courteous service and today was no exception.  It's Wendy's, so I can't say much else."}
{"text":"For fast food, they are really fast! This place is packed and there is a line and it is moving so quickly! The staff and management here are awesome!"}
{"text":"Yikes!  Problems: Long wait - We waited for 10 minutes to order and then another 15 to get our food. There were only 2 cars ahead of us. Awful food - My fries were still frozen. My sandwich was cold. Horrible service - The employees were too busy chatting and socializing with each other. They didn't even apologize for the long wait."}
{"text":"I ordered nuggets, jr cheeseburger, chili, and value fries. Everything was served at room temperature except for the chili. I think the chili sits in a hot pot which is probably why it is served hot. They forgot to give me my nuggets so I had to park and run inside from the drive through to get them. Food sits waiting to be ordered so it may not come out as fresh as most would like. Food is cheap though so if your looking for a quick fix at a good price then this place will be okay."}
{"text":"It's regular Wendy's food.  Based off of that expectation, this place is perfectly fine.  It seems like no one ever has time to write anything but bad reviews about fast food, so I will do my part to strike a blow for those who were satisfied by the service here.  I usually come here on off peak hours and I typically just get some Jr. Hamburgers and fries (I'm a big fan of sliders and these are the closest you can get in my area with no White Castle in Phoenix).  The peak meal hours are definitely busier, your order will definitely take a little longer, and I tend to avoid these times as a result.  I almost exclusively use the drive thru, but I have gone inside to order occasionally and have had no issues with either.  The dining room was clean, and what you expect for your standard fast food joint.  I only come here when I'm too busy to cook, but when those times come (and they do), this Wendy's location is always near the top of my list of choices."}
{"text":"Worst food I've ever had at Wendy's.Order was wrong.Food was cold.Wasnt offered ketchup or condiments for $18 worth of food.Then when asked the young girl she looked at me like it was inconvenience.Was given only 1.Pathetic!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a picky person, but this location was awful. The floor was covered in sticky spills, the napkin container was empty, ketchup was empty, 4 sodas were out in the soda machine. Instead of remedying these things, about 7 or 8 employees sat in the restaurant just hanging out. On top of that, they're yelling, cussing at each other all while kids are in the restaurant. I don't mind the language, but when kids ages 3-6 are present, it's not cool. Food was terrible as well."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place it used to be really fast and fresh but now it's the complete opposite. I tried ordering inside but cashier literally took 10+ minutes with one order and then the manager started yelling about her checking the orders and she left for another 5 minutes. Then I left and went thru the drive thru (I was getting food for my coworkers) and the lady working the speaker rushes so fast that she gives you your total before you're done with your order. You then get asked to wait around to corner for 10 minutes for chicken strips so the strips are piping hot but everything else is already ice cold. I will say though the lady working register at the drive thru is the nicest and best thing about this place she is a 5 star employee. She's also pregnant which sucks she has to be on her feet and working I hope she gets a good maternity leave."}
{"text":"I come to this Wendy's all the time for lunch. Its super close to work.  I frequent the drive thru, so this review is for drive thru service only.    The staff are friendly and fast, and I have never had an order come back wrong.  No tomato, extra mayo, extra pickle, etc...they've never gotten it wrong for me.  Yesterday I tried out the grilled chicken flatbread, with the asiago and ranch.  It was really good.  Fresh greens, tomato, and it wasn't drowned in ranch dressing...just enough for some good flavor."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place. The long line didn't bother me, I understand how busy a place could be. The guy who took my order was very friendly. The lady who handed my food was friendly as well. The only thing that bother me was that I order a larger order and when I got my fries they weren't fresh, they were cold and they were half way full. But I'll be returning :) gotta give you guys a second chance :)"}
{"text":"Exciting news people! For years Wendy's has been serving bland tasteless dry burgers and horrible fries. My husband has a certain fondness for them, but he had always been forced to eat at Wendy's without me because I couldn't tolerate crappy fast food.   This all changed recently when Las Vegas became THE test market for the entire country for Dave's new Hot and Juicy burger and natural cut fries with sea salt. Yup, in many parts of the country they still are serving those dry tasteless burgers but not here my friends....  The new burger is the real deal. It IS hot and juicy and really great for a fast food burger. I don't get why it's so juicy and moist, but it is somehow. They also have nice new fresh veggies (apparently crinkle cut pickles are a big deal? and red onions?) and a new improved bun with BUTTER ON IT. Oh hell yes. If I'm eating 50 grams of fat damnit give me a couple more. The fries are much improved as well !   If you must slum it at Wendy's for whatever reason, have no fear, the food is finally decent !"}
{"text":"Go to ANY other Wendy's.  These people do not care.  Order was wrong, out of everything.  Very young/uncaring/rude staff.  With so many other options, I won't be going here again.  They also didn't tell me my total or give me a receipt, so I'll be checking with my bank on the debit transaction.  Use caution."}
{"text":"About 3 weeks ago I went in the drive thru and ordered $16 worth. Got to our destination only to find that half the order was missing. The manager said I would have to make the 20 minute drive back to take care of this and was stand offish as well. I talked to the district manager who said she would send a gift card.  I left my address and phone number. As of yet I have received nothing. When following up I was told the mail was returned (yet why didn't they call me). I have come in to follow up and was told that is was mailed.  That was over a week ago.   This is not an isolated incident, either. In the past year I have been here 4 times and 3 times they have botched the order.  Update: Now has been 5 weeks so I went into the store. They rang in a gift card on the spot, the issue is settled."}
{"text":"I came here while waiting for a flight to Charlotte NC. I have to say that while I found the place to be overpriced as usual which isn't a big surprise, my overall experience there was dismal. It could be because there was nobody there. And I mean it. When I went up to make my order, there was nobody paying attention despite there being activity in the back, so after a couple of minutes of pacing to and fro, finally I called out to them, and someone came up. I was also there during their posted business hours so that was no excuse.   The rest of the experience went as expected. The woman who helped me was polite and apologized for the delay. The food was made to order and although it took a little longer than expected since they may have needed to warm up the heaters, it was ready pretty quickly. I ordered a cheeseburger and a baked potato, however the burger was overcooked, and the cheese was placed on top a bit sloppily. Finally I asked for sour cream and chives for my baked potato and they didn't provide me with them either. Kind of strange since it was the woman who asked me if I wanted it.   Overall, I was just not impressed with this place. They need to do a better job managing it."}
{"text":"Order 2 large Chilis 2 spicy Chicken Nuggets 2 large Drinks (Fruit Punch and Diet Coke)  Simple order you would think...........NOT  2 large chilis were filled only half full No spoons to eat it with Does Diet Coke sound like Regular Root Beer?  I will keep writing reviews on this place until they change their ways. Give someone else a job if you don't want to work there."}
{"text":"Simple order of Spicy Chicken Nuggets and a small Chili.  I get a small chili that is so runny that it's like broth and to top that off I was given no crackers. If you don't have enough chili and your giving someone the bottom of the pot then at least give crackers. :("}
{"text":"Ordered food today between 5pm and 5:30pm and it was less than ok. The chicken sandwich was good but that is where it ends. Baked potato was cold and this particular store doesn't have cheese or bacon for its potato's? Ok uh huh. The fries were white and raw. The soda had a funny taste and I'm not sure if it was the mixture or the ice."}
{"text":"Slow service...not enough help, go figure its just lunch time... ..filthy tables.  For a new store unimpressed."}
{"text":"If I could give them zero stars, I would. Extremely rude staff. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"As far as national fast food chains go - Wendy's is one of the better ones. I appreciate that you can get a salad instead of fries here. Their burgers usualy seem fresher and better tasting too. However, this location appears to be one of the worst run Wendy's I've ever been to. My salad not cold, was wilted, and had lots of brown bits. Service was far from enthusiastic."}
{"text":"I am generally a fan of Wendy's as there food is better than McDonald's. I went in and ordered 2 hamburgers with no cheese and extra extra pickle and a large fry no salt. There was no line and it took forever for the order. The service was ok the cashier was friendly. I had ordered it to go and I got to my car to eat the burger and noticed cheese on it and no pickles. The cashier did not listen at all and got the order wrong I went back in with order and told them that it was supposed to be extra extra pickle and no cheese. I also said for them to make the fries over as they would be iced cold by the time i ate them. The cashier called over another person maybe a supervisor and they gave me a dirty look and came over and said what was wrong with fries. I said nothing except that you got the order for the hamburgers wrong and by the time you make 2 more the fries will be cold. She took the bag of fries and tossed them in the garbage angrily. Finally got my order and it was correct. The food is good and I love the fries. I have to be honest as much as I like Wendy's I will never go in this location again. Customer service terrible supervisor terrible and can't get an order correct?????"}
{"text":"It's a Wendy's - they have square hamburgers and you can substitute Baked potatoes for fries, which should be available at all fast food places!   A note on the sour cream for the potatoes: it is \"reduced fat\" sour cream. Ummm....cream, by definition is chock full of fat. If you reduce said fat I am not sure it qualifies as cream anymore...  Anyway - I just wanted to let people know that this location features the Freestyle Coca-Cola thingy if you are into all that. I had never heard of it before, and we were in the drive thru so we didn't really utilize its advertised capabilities of 100+ drink combinations.   The drive thru features a snazzy video screen menu board, which probably cost them thousands but you still can't figure out what number a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger Meal is supposed to be....  As for the food - my burger was warm when we got home, the potato was BIG and the lettuce/tomato on the burgers were fresh! The bacon was also delightfully crispy ( a rarity in a burger u don't make yourself)."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem at this Wendy's. It is one of the few drive-thrus that don't screw up the order.   Food is always fresh and hot. Those pretzel-bun bacon burgers are mighty tasty, in case you were wondering."}
{"text":"So gross!! We ordered 2 spicy chicken meals, 17 bucks. Get it home, ugh the meat was brown. Fried were good so that's what I'm eating for dinner since I threw the sandwich out. Never again!"}
{"text":"20 minute wait with 2 customers ahead of me.  At almost 3 pm. The service was trash,  the restaurant was filthy. I had just finished working under a house and was cleaner then this restaurant.  Turns out order was never made. 10 outta 10 will not come back."}
{"text":"Wanted to make sure we're all on the same page when I say that no fast food chain joint will ever get higher than a 3 star simply because of the health and cleanliness factors.    With that said, I've been to the drive thru at this Wendy's location several times over the past year, and each time they've gotten my order correct and out to me in a timely manner.  Their 4 for $4 is by far way better than the other FF joints that tried to copy Wendy's afterwards.  The employees have been courtesy, maybe sometimes overworked, but for the most part... all have decent attitudes.  If you're looking for organic and health eats along with 5 star service, go else where and pay 3-4 times more than what you pay at Wendy's, B-K, or Micky D's.  Otherwise, I say give these folks a break and just say \"thank you!\" for doing an honest job that most of us don't want to or can't do.   PEACE my ninjas!"}
{"text":"Surly service.  I was the first customer of the day and the clerk was clearly annoyed that I came in. Not a thank you or a greeting.  Just s \"there you go\". I finally asked for lemons for my tea before I left which seemed a big imposition. The burger was decent but I won't go here again if I can avoid it.  I should add I was helped last week by a middle aged woman who was great. She understood that I wanted some nice lemons and went out if her way to be friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This location is \"ok\". I haven't had a horrible experience, but I've never been wow'd either. 9 times out of 10 my order is correct. The staff while not very cordial, are usually accommodating.   This is definitely a place where you go if you are craving Wendy's or if there is a long line at Cookout."}
{"text":"Horrible. I like Wendy's but this location is awful. I agree with the other review in that they have to be this bad on purpose. They don't care about providing quality food.   Don't ever eat there after 11:00 pm. The food will be old and burnt to a crisp.  The general manager or regional general manager doesn't care either if you complain.  There's enough options near by, just don't go here."}
{"text":"I like this Wendy's. The food is made to order and taste like Wendy's should. The staff is friendly and efficient. Drive through moves fast."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and quick. They also do a good job of getting my food prepared as ordered each time. No complaints here and food tastes fresh for fast food standards."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 Monterey chicken sandwiches, added tomato in the drive thru.  Everything was made correctly and tasted good. Was a little surprised with all the negative reviews, place seems nice"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst customer service experiences I have EVER encountered! The manager was SO RUDE that I refuse to ever step back in that store. Worst experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"I only go here if I am studying or really really hungry.  I give this location a lower review, since when I was studying I ordered the Caesar salad (which I rarely have). I was studying for an exam at the time, and usually don't try anything super new at these times, but I thought, what could go wrong with a Caesar salad? Well something tasted odd, and I ended up with food poisoning that had be bed-bathroom ridden for a week. Since then, I am very very very cautious to eat anywhere new when I have something big coming up.  I have tried the various burgers here when studying, and they satisfy my hunger. Probably the only good thing is the chicken fingers as well. Really only have it when I am really hungry. I go to this location primarily for the attached Timmies and the outdoor summer parking with friends."}
{"text":"Worst ever. Took so long to get our order. Needs new management, obviously.  The person taking our order through the drive thru, didn't listen and got the order wrong. Also, he didn't give us a total. We will not be back to this location."}
{"text":"Went to Wendy's for dinner. Double stack combo (no onion) with small fries and an unsweetened iced tea. They were out of tea at the main counter but I guess they had more at the drive thru window. No Coca Cola Freestyle at this location. The dining area was kind of dirty with fries on the floor and chairs not pushed in neatly. The food was fine. Average burger with hot & fresh fries."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru for a Double Stack combo, no onion. It was quick, cheap (under 5 bucks), order was correct, fries were hot, and I like the unsweetened iced tea they have now... reminiscent of the Panda Passion tea at Panda Express. Solid Wendy's visit!"}
{"text":"Always love grabbing a first...  I have a lot of customers in the Vegas area, and I stopped here last Thursday just to get a quick bite between meetings. I saw the sign on the 15S for this Wendy's I am a fan... NOTE: it's about 3 miles off the highway, not right off the highway as I assumed it was.  Anyway, I knew they had a new menu, and I said what the heck, I'll give it a shot. I got the new D.T. original 1/4 lb burger combo, total was just over 6$, pretty decent deal! The sea salted fries were about the same as before, and service at this location was about average.  Clientele was very blue collar, quiet atmosphere, a nice Wendy's... Just remember, its a bit off the highway..."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is much better than the one on West Lake Mead. Employees act professional. Restaurant was clean. Bathroom was clean and sink actually worked. Service was fast and food was nice and hot. The manager even put my food under the heat lamp to make sure it stayed warm while I used the restroom. Quality of an establishment mirrors the management running the place. This particular one is good."}
{"text":"well I was reminded today of why I gave a bad review last time I was here. this time profanity being used behind the counter. sink in the men's restroom hardly puts out any water. soap container falling off the wall maybe from the nasty old cigarette that is stuck to the back of it. tried using the ketchup at the condiment stand and ketchup shot everywhere except the cup. I thinks it time for some snhd at this place."}
{"text":"Once a year I tell myself that there is no way Wendys has not improved...so I try again.. Well,It is possible that this Wendy's is worse than ever..what a shame. So many complaints and many people talk about how the quality has gone down hill..This is just sad.Pathetic actually.Cold.Gross.BAD.... I CANT BELIEVE IT BUT MCDONALDS MAY HAVE BETTER SERVICE AND FOOD! GOODBYE WENDY'S. Things sure have changed over the years and I am amazed they stay open. I guess people truly don't care but I'm done. And the owners most definitely don't care! Today was the last day I kick myself into thinking it will improve."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst wendys around you wait 10 min in the drive through and then havr to go back around or go in becuase they have incompetent people working there its not very hard to get a fast food order right. they need to hire people that know what they are doing"}
{"text":"The new crispy chicken sandwiches are the \" bomb \" and only a buck"}
{"text":"This Wendy's served me raw chicken. Do not eat at this location. See the photo. Luckily after I bit into the cold raw chicken I was able to spit it out."}
{"text":"a wendy's just like any other. ordered the bacon [portabello] mushroom melt. has to be one of my favourite fast food burgers. i get excited everytime it is back on the menu. cashier could've been a bit more professional though."}
{"text":"I rarely review fast food chain restaurants but I felt compelled with this Wendy's location.  I've only eaten here at night via drive thru when I'm desperate, but I must say this location surprisingly seems to have made to order fresh food.  Each time I've ordered it was like 10pm or later and I always ask \"can you please make that fresh\" (most Wendys locations have burgers that are cold by the time you get home so a fresh one buys you some time to get home before its nasty).  Each time I ask they reply \"we always cook the items fresh at night\".  Sounds good to me.  Also, the manager is always very friendly and accommodating.  He makes his presence known during drive thru pick up and seems to be upbeat and competent.  I'm not always in the mood for Wendy's but when I am I go here.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I worked at this Wendy's throughout high school and I want to cry when I go there now.  The SERVICE is HORRIBLE!  Omg, no sense of urgency whatsoever.  There is always a line at the drive-thru, always.  Makes me want to pop behind the counter again and get things moving.  Ugh."}
{"text":"Driving with my son, he said he was hungry. I told him that there was Arby's, Wendy's, McDonald's and Burger King nearby. I said, which place do you want to eat at. He said, \"Wendy's\". I asked him why he chose Wendy's and he said, \"Because it's better than McDonald's!\"  When you're right, you're right.  This recently remodeled Wendy's has been here for quite some time. I stopped by to get my son a kids meal with chicken tenders, french fries, and chocolate milk. I ordered myself a $1.00 chicken sandwich. We both liked our food. For $1.00, it was a terrific sandwich. What a great value!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Wendy's after a recent, nearby volleyball tournament around 8:30 PM and they were short staffed. The line in the drive through wrapped around the building, so we went inside to place our orders. A few minutes later, a lined began to form while we received our food.   I ordered a chicken salad with apples and it was delicious. My daughter ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. The Coca-Cola machine offered a virtually unlimited variety of sodas, which is really cool. It can be frustrating waiting for persons who have never used these machines because it takes a minute to figure out the interface. Since there was only one machine, we found ourselves waiting for a while, even though there was only one, non-technical person in front of us.  I really felt bad for the people behind us because this one lady waited more than 10 minutes for a burger. She was patient, however. When we walked out after finishing our meals, she was still waiting patiently."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Wendy's for a quick bite last week with the family.  We were taking a road trip, so we decided to eat lightly.  My wife and I both ordered the full size apple pecan chicken salad.  The server told me that they would have to make the salads from scratch.  I did not argue with him about that!  I guess that is the norm for these salads.  The salad was fresh and delicious.  The chicken was tasty, the greens were fresh and crispy too.  The apples and pecans were yummy and this is definitely one of the best salads I've ever had at a fast food restaurant.  I've been eating Wendy's salads since I was a teenager.  Anyone remember their taco salad?  Anyway, I love having healthy, fresh options when driving.  I find that eating salads while on road trips helps me stay awake better on the road.    The only improvement Wendy's could make is to replace their iceberg lettuce with Romaine.  The salad already had spinach in it.  Totally recommend the salads!"}
{"text":"Eh. This location could not get my three item order correct. Biggest peeve is I asked for a medium strawberry tea with lots of ice. Instead I got a small strawberry tea with 3 ice cubes. I asked for more ice and when I got it back, the entire cup was sticky. Yuck."}
{"text":"Most Yelp reviews either praise the food and/or service or hate the food and/or service. This was the first eatery that I've ever reviewed that neither of the above mattered. This review is for the sheer comedy.  I arrived after lunch rush so there were only about a dozen people in the dining room. There was a small group ahead of me who had already ordered. The cashier was obviously new and had zero training. She ended up trying to do every task instead of taking orders and letting the staff behind her do the prep work, to the amusement of her co-workers who giggled at her. I stood in line while more people came in after me but since she had zero support from her co-workers she ended up ignoring us for close to 5 minutes while she begged for help with the order ahead of me, which the other staff either ignored or screwed up just for grins. She begged for help from someone who was supposed to be working with her who just shuffled around lazily (I think he quit right after that, not sure). She asked him to have the manager help and he laughed with a \"good luck with that\" attitude. The manager did in fact come over to the other (closed) register, never looked up at the line, and pompously swiped her card several times in the register, snickered at what was happening then turned her back.  So would you review this place on the quality of service?  I'm not going to.  I'll review it on the quality of entertainment. By now the customers before me were in belly laughs. The rest of the restaurant was giggling and some openly laughing at an example of a fast food place run so bad that it would not even be believable on a service-nightmare episode of Undercover Boss.  When the poor trainee finally got to my order what she entered in the cash register had no resemblance to what I ordered and I was grossly overcharged. I could see the manager tittering in the background while no one helped her and the first customers continued to wait while their order continually got screwed up and by now customers were openly laughing.  I took it in good spirits and decided I wasn't going to give this place only one star because of the counter clerk's lack of training or her useless manager. Nope I would give it one star because (keep in mind I haven't been to a Wendy's in several years, and now I know why) OMG!!! you need a microscope to find their food portions.  The last time I was at a Wendy's they served portions equivalent to most other places. Not so now ... the chewy, greasy burger was soooo tiny and left little pieces of fat in my mouth and the drink was about the size of a 3-year olds sippy cup (they pour for you so what you get is what they give you).  I actually wish I was the \"boss\" of Wendy's on Undercover Boss so I could have fired this manager on the spot but I know I couldn't have because I would actually be back at corporate HQ trying to stop Dave Thomas from spinning in his grave."}
{"text":"I usually post some place that's worth going, but this is a place I have to fore-warn you about.  First, bad customer service.  Wrong me the order, then made me wait 15 minutes for a hamburger since everything is frozen solid.  No apology from the manager, and didn't even notify me the ETA of my burger.  2nd, their \"FRESH\" salad is rock solid.  If you want \"FRESH\" frozen salad, this is the place to be.    3rd, I would not go to any Wendy's anymore unless Dave comes out personally and apologize to customers they've pissed off!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this is one of the few fast food chains my husband will eat at but I can't stand this specific location. Every single time I go here my food is always cold and blah. The only time I've ever gotten fresh food is when I've ordered a large, otherwise its cold leftover limp fries.  It's like going out with someone you've met online strictly as friends but then they call you their date or ask if they can kiss you at the end of the night (and they always have bad breath!) when all you want is for the night to end asap.  However, I have to admit that I saw a new face when I checked in here and was pleasantly surprised that my food was actually warm & fresh. I had to wait in the parking lot for my order to be made but the nice young kid who brought me my food was awesome! Maybe all they need is a new & improved staff?"}
{"text":"I had a long wait time just to receive the wrong order. I ordered two baconator combos and one spicy chicken sandwich combo with cheese. Instead I got two asiago chicken combos and one spicy chicken with no cheese. Only the drinks were correct. Wow! Not to mention their prices are now comparable to better quality fast food places. Fool me once shame on me but never again. I wish I could give NO stars."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here on a date. We waited for over 45 minutes to be seated. We were finally approached by a janitor who informed us we would need to go to the cashier. My girlfriend and I were visibly upset at this point but we decided to comply hoping this would be the end of our troubles. We were wrong. When I reached the front of the line I told the women at the cashier I had a reservation for 7pm. The women had no idea what I was talking about and asked me what would like to eat. I kept pressing her about our reservation but she would only reply with menu items. Looking back, I'm not sure she spoke English. At this point I decided to call it quits and take my girlfriend somewhere else (Roberto's). I am thoroughly disappointed in Wendy and will no longer be dining at her restaurants any longer. Let this be a warning to all of you, Wendy's is not a fine dining establishment."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's, however every time I go to this specific location I always have a bad experience! The employees are always so rude whether it's drive though or dine-in. I don't recommend to go to this specific location. I've gone at least 5 times and I always say I will never go back, but the food is amazing and I don't understand why the staff isn't."}
{"text":"I actually like this Wendy over the other ones in the city.  While the menu is about the same just like any Wendy in town, and there's no difference in pricing obviously, this one seems to be kept in much better shape than most of the other ones I've been to in Calgary (especially way better in appearance than the sad shape of the one on Macleod and 73rd).    What especially differentiates this over the rest is the Solarium front.  It's a brilliant place to people watch while being insulated from the elements when it's bad, and to bask in the sun when it's warm.  As the reasonably healthy inexpensive pico de gallo grilled chicken wrap and the side garden salad with a vinegrette, and there's proof that you can have an inexpensive $4 lunch meal that's actually healthy at a fast food place."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru and Ordered 3 #1 single hamburger combo; one plain and one chocolate frosty. Drinks were 1 Sierra Mist and 2 coke. Disappointingly when we got home we found we did not receive the plain burger and did not get the Sierra Mist. The cashier was either inattentive and put the order in incorrectly or the person who putting the order was not reading the screen correctly. We did verify with the cashier when paying that we wanted 3 burgers with one of them plain but we did not get what we ordered!   French fries were soggy and not fresh; no salt."}
{"text":"the only reason there are 2 & not 1 star, is because the night manager is extremely sweet. but this bitch ass lady was beyond rude, it took 2 minutes to even make an order in the drivethru. she cut me off in the middle of my order & didn't even ask what sauce i wanted for my nuggets??? NOT ONLY THAT, we were short a nugget. i guess that counting to 8 was a little to hard.. when they were out of what i ordered, she was disrespectful as hell when reading off only 2 menu items. this green haired ass hoe also neglected to give me my receipt and was very rude when i asked for my third frosty which she forgot to give me... bitch handed me my third frosty upside down??? f u ho"}
{"text":"Location: this is the only burger joint in the student centre. They have a captive market and they know it and take student patrons for granted.   Now that there's a better burger place in York lanes, I doubt I'll be back here.   Service:  the service is rude. They don't smile or say thank you come again or anything. Once They got my order wrong and when I asked them to fix it, they did and handed it to me and said \"there.  Are you happy now?\"  Said in a snarky tone.   Food: I find the food dry and bland. The menu is a bit bizarre in that you can't customize.  I prefer the burger places where you choose your toppings and the burgers are tastier even if I have to pay a little more."}
{"text":"We all know fast food, but Wendy's food is usually better quality. The 3 stars are because the Strawberry Fields Salad & Strawberry Iced Tea & their chicken sandwiches are wonderful. The service at this location leaves something to be desired (1 star service.)"}
{"text":"If you want to be disappointed in what was once a good reputable burger place look no further then this Wendy's. Seriously how hard is to order a kids cheese burger with ketchup only? Or a double plan no cheese? And a fresh salad with out brown wilted lettuce? And when you call them to let them know the order was incorrect and you say you spoke to a male mgr and they tell you we have no female managers just males which is what I said initially they get all mad and somewhat hostile. Never again will I go to this or any other Wendy's!"}
{"text":"The food is always good but if you go thru the drive thru the staff is ALWAYS RUDE. I know better not to be fuck with people who make my food, especially since I love grabbing a quick snack after I get off work. Double check your order too BEFORE you drive away especially at this location..."}
{"text":"On our way back to CA from a weekend in Vegas we dropped by this location to grab a quick bite on the way home through the drive though. The girl who took our order seemed a little confused so we had to repeat ourselves a couple times. We ordered a hand full of spicy chicken nuggets and we had to wait for them to be freshly made. When we got them, they were crispy and not as steaming hot as I would've expected and they were kinda shady on the sauces. We got fries with no ketchup ( we weren't even asked if we wanted any) had 6 orders or nuggets and only got 3 sauces so we had to go back in to ask them for more."}
{"text":"They cannot  include straws in the drive thru with two drinks and a frosty ?!?! Really ? Unfortunately , we realized this after we were turned going south on Stephanie, going home to Anthem. Wendy's is located very inconveniently to turn into if you're already headed south going towards the freeway!"}
{"text":"Finally...... Took 3 tries but they Finally got an Order right..."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced (and the second worst is now out of business - Patrick Street, Charleston WV - this one can't be far behind, based on our experience last night.  We went through the drive through at 11pm.  Or I should say we tried to go through the drive through at 11pm.  We were leaving the theaters with two kids and trying to get a late bite on the way back to our hotel. There was a guy in the store trying to sweet, the lights were on, the menus were lit.  Everything indicated it was a typical late night drive through Wendy's.  There were two cars in front of us.  We sat at the speaker, nothing.  At one point we heard someone say a chopped word, but it was unintelligible.  After a few minutes we drove up.  Watched the SUV in front of us apparently try to get their order right for 5 minutes. Then pulled up.  The guys there ignored us.  After rapping on the window, they said they were closed. I told them they ignored us at the speaker, now ignored us at the window, and they're supposed to be open, signs are lit, the hours said they were still open.  The guy says one word, \"truck.\"  I had no idea what that meant, so he says \"we got a truck.\"  Now how is ANY customer supposed to know what that means?  And why does getting a truck mean they get to ignore customers at the windows and make them wait for no reason?   Everyone involved in that fiasco last night really shouldn't have a job.  They just didn't care. It would be one thing if they came on the speaker and said \"I'm sorry sir, we're having issues and we're closed.\"   They just ignored us and wasted our time.  That's just plain ignorant.  Wendy's is one of our only and favorite fast food burger joints. They've now wasted my and my children's time and they're going to lose 5 or 10 sales, at ALL locations now, because I'm going to take my money elsewhere.  People go to franchises they know are open and for the same consistent quality and service.  This restaurant /franchisee broke that trust, and it's going to cost the company now.    Judging from the ample very poor feedback I see on here, this location has a LOT of problems."}
{"text":"I like this Wendy's. The crew really tries hard to please, the place is always neat and clean and the food is okay. The current menu of salads is very good and the recent remodel makes it a cozy place to grab a quick meal. Thanks Dave!"}
{"text":"Ordered a double mozzarella burger with no onion..instead I got a single with onion. Check your food before you leave here."}
{"text":"The outgoing positive manner and delightful service my husband and I just experienced at this drive through provided by Toni & Fallon was exceptional. It's not often you can order fast food and get it \"fast\" or even order with a smile and receive one in return! I have had multiple experiences with this location including service to us and our daughter but yet to have met these great ladies. Thanks for a great taco salad and service! We will be back to see y'all (Cruzin down the street in our 64)"}
{"text":"Good service, ordered the Baconator.  Mine should have been called the Bacon not or. I I'll try to post a picture. Not a comparatively clean place either. We usually go to the Chik Fil A which is nearby, far better choice, but were a little rushed and didn't want to wait."}
{"text":"It's chill, I mean the apple pecan salad is always good, and the service is pretty good. The drive thru attendant was super polite. But the food wasn't even hot, and the order wasn't placed right. It's okay. Its Wendy's ?  On the plus side I always enjoy the baked potato."}
{"text":"extremely slow!!!!! only one car ahead of us and we only wanted 2 bottles of water sat there for close to 10 minutes pathetic. lost our business forever."}
{"text":"Thanks for my store bought frozen chicken tenders.. they taste disgusting, they look nothing like your advertisement but why I am not surprised, the quality of this item sucks.. sorry but I won't be ever waste my $ again + oh plus y'all need to get better fries"}
{"text":"Crappy. Just plain crappy.  Horrible customer svc.  Waited in line to place order over 7 minutes. Food took forever to plate. Old cold fries. Wrong size salad. Noticed 3 people standing around instead of opening another register to speed things up. No forks unless you ask. Just rude slow employees. Small portioned food. Wish ownership knew just how bad everything is at this particular Wendy's. Btw this was all eat in not drive thru."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today. The cashier barely made eye contact. I ordered a burger, well done fries ans a sma Frosty. The cashier never asked if the order was to go or for est in. I asked the houng l.j ady who put everything on a tray to please make my order to go. I hate cold froes so I alwsys eat yhem in the car. Not onky were they not well done, th hey were barely warm. What a bummer. The burger was good and so was the Frosty."}
{"text":"Always a good experience at this location. It's renovated and the dining room and even bathrooms (atypical for a fast food joint) are very clean. The service is usually quick with no issues. The asian cashew chicken salad is surprisingly delicious and crave worthy for a fast food salad, and is less than 400 calories! Oh, and they have that cool coca cola fountain with a million drink options. Much nicer location than the one on Eastern."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken nuggets, and when I received my food, a chicken nugget had a bite out of it. One of the nuggets wasn't even a nugget, it was a chicken tender - again, with (what seemed like) a bite out of it. The first one was for sure a bite. A bit disappointed, but the frosty was great with the fries."}
{"text":"I walked into this location wearing a parka and was absolutely freezing.  The thermostat at the counter read 63 when I went to place my order.  My husband and I asked the employee if there was any way they could raise it a few degrees - I saw other people in the dining room with their jackets and hats still on.  The woman said \"it's not up to us, corporate does it.\"    On another note, our fries were cold.  Maybe that's just because the place itself was freezing.    Won't be back."}
{"text":"They were fast at ordering, but by the time we received the food, nothing was labeled and we were missing items that we paid for. The fries were half way filled and there weren't any hiding at the bottom of the bag. Obviously, not a trained staff for rush hour or any hour. If you want $15/hour, you need to learn how to work for it and not steal it from the customer."}
{"text":"I didnt expect that the hamburger here was supper yummy like this!!!! I tried the special one with mushroom and bacon. There was the baked potato also, my friend misunderstood and order for me hamburger, but it was still perfect!!! I think the key for it is the yellow sauce. I was so surprised bc i never hope too much for fast food. I am not fan of fast food. But from thjs time, i will change my mind lol.  This is not too big, enough for 1 person. I also order 1 strawberry lemonade, too sweet, i will just order lemonade will be better.  Beside of wendys is tim horton. The price of wendys is more expensive but u know, we get what we pay for. The hamburger from tim is boring, i felt disappointed for the first time. So u can, try wendys is better.  The space here is comfortable, not too noisy also. There is a table for game but idk what is it. Next time, i will try salad here."}
{"text":"We had quite a difficult order and it was made to perfection. My best friend and I had two orders. Hers, chicken nuggets (insanely delicious, crunchy, flavorful) Mine, burger with limited options (just like I wanted) perfect, buttery buns, did I say perfect?). Eat here."}
{"text":"Wendy's is decent at making burgers but they can not make a good grilled chicken sandwich...at least one that is not wet...and it is not just this location, it is at all of them.   Atmosphere - Newer, clean, busy, funny   Food - I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. While labeled as improved, it still was damp to the point of making the bun soggy. I think they keep these things in a bath of chicken broth to maintain moisture. For my side, I opted for the healthy mandarin oranges instead of fries. This gave the girl at the the counter a good laugh...as she said \"Oh, how cute\".   Service - Despite being made fun of...it was great. I called the counter girl out on it, in a funny way, by telling her that I was watching my figure. This got her and the girl behind her to laugh.   Price - combo meal $6.54   Overall - I look forward to trying that apple pecan salad...you know..because I am watching my figure!"}
{"text":"What can i say. Its Wendys. But when i pull up to the Drive thru and the Guy on the other end says Welcome to Wendys We are better than Mc Donalds thats always a good thing. And I love the new Menu option with half a Salad and then you pick out of other things. I had a frosty. The BLT Cobb salad was delicious with no dressing on it. And they kept the drive thru moving."}
{"text":"When in the fast food mood I alternate between this Wendy's and the BK just east.  Generally the burgers are better here.   But the best thing about this place is Patrick, a young man who is meticulous about cleanliness.  Cleanliness is key at any restaurant so, in addition to cash register duty, Patrick works tirelessly to keep this Wendy's spotless.  Rock on, Patrick! Now... if we can just get the manager to slide the soundtrack up two decades. To the 70s."}
{"text":"Food is what you expect. Now the store, well it was freezing cold inside. The floors all about the drink dispensing area was gross and sticky, made me feel disgusting. What is it that employees can not keep their restaurant clean and a comfortable inviting place?"}
{"text":"Check your order before leaving the drive thru.  Ordered a double cheese burger,  but got the dollar version.  Ripped off."}
{"text":"Nowhere to sit, and it's busy! Typical Wendy's fare, with fast-food employees to match."}
{"text":"So I go there once in a while to order a salad as I do not normally do fast food, but at least its a salad and usually pretty decent.    First one of the two salads I order are No Longer carried??  Still on the sign, but no longer carried as of today..... (Mozzarella)  So I order another salad in place of that one (was for the Mrs) and I ask about the Taco Salad.   When I get home, without letting me know when I ordered, they did not have a FULL Size Taco salad, so they gave me two half sizes, but the 'ingredients' for a full size. It does not scale well.  The FULL Size Spicy Caesar did NOT come with a cover and had saran wrap on it. No explanation, no warning. When it comes to food, it is not good not tell explain something like that.  The ONLY saving grace part of the experience was the Nice older lady 'greeter' (?) that suggested I buy (donate) to get a coupon book of free Mini Frosty's as they did not have the salad my wife wanted........"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is so slow every time I come. They also aren't very pleasant people that work there. I have also had them having a conversation while I was trying to order. Just waited over 10 mins to even get to the microphone."}
{"text":"Received a ton of great breakfast coupons and decided to try them all out. The iced coffee was pretty good, up to the McDonald's standard I'd say. The artisan panini breakfast sandwiches were YUM!!! So surprised at the quality. The oatmeal bar was DELICIOUS and only a dollar. The home fries had good seasoning. In addition the manager is very nice an recognizes me. :)"}
{"text":"Happy about food presentation and flavor. New fries are great. I did NOT like the large sweet tea is $2.20... Keep up with the times. Drinks SHOULD BE $1.00"}
{"text":"Their food is never prepared the way you ask them to. Fries are always gross. They act like its a chore to help you.  After all these issues I still used to go to this location solely because T-Mobile Tuesday's gave you a free frosty at Wendy's and now they don't do that anymore as of 8/23. So yeah, definitely not the best Wendy's by a long shot."}
{"text":"This wendys is the wendys of all wendys! On getting things wrong that is  Always check your bag as everythings always wrong Also this one is the one with by far the worst food everything's pre fried and dry."}
{"text":"Always closed before 11 , its honestly hit or kiss you never know if its going to be closed or not, foods always terrible as well , stay clear of this one and the south gate one. You can try Macedonia but they close a little after 10..."}
{"text":"It's a typical fast food place. The service is okay, they get the order right, the prices are just fine."}
{"text":"Seems like Wendy's has gone to hell since Dave died. This one is so bad walked in to 10 people in line and one cashier. Went to the drive through that was a mistake. There was a very large woman who I assume was the manger and she was doing nothing to help with the crowd. The guy at the window was friendly you could tell he was stressed. I predict Wendy's will fade away in a few years if they don't pull it together"}
{"text":"Oh Wendy's, I love your chili, especially when I add the spicy chili packet, cheese and onions!! Super yummy, super fast and super CHEAP!!! They include saltine crackers to top it off! If you haven't tried their chili, you must do so!!! It is flavorful, has onions, bell pepper and chunks of ground beef and, of course, beans! It is always so fresh, probably because it is a top seller!!  I also love the $1.00 baked potato with chives, low fat sour cream and whipped butter!! What a value!! Yes, chili sometimes goes on top on of my baked potato!  Right now, Wendy's has kid's meals for $1.99 after 4:00!!   This location is our go to spot for a quick, cheap and tasty fast food meal! Super upbeat and friendly employees each and every time!!"}
{"text":"I like this location of Wendy's!! We have a brand new location near my house on Lake Pleasant Parkway and it is filled with incompetent employees and the design is just stupid! It was my first time at this location and I will go out of my way in the future to visit here instead! This location has been remodeled and they did a great job with the remodel!!  Most importantly, the \"Host\" Feebe (per the receipt) was welcoming, warm and competent!! She is definitely an asset to Wendy's and this location!! She made the experience a true experience, not just another stop at a fast food place!! I hope to see her when I return!! Kudos to the manager who hired her!! Send her to the Lake Pleasant Parkway location as they need employees that shine at that location because I have no desire to go back there!! Feebe proved tonight that a fast food stop can be an experience that stands out and is enjoyable!!"}
{"text":"This Wendy's is a training facility. You get what what you pay for. If its something they don't have to assemble your safe, otherwise don't even slow down to make the turn."}
{"text":"I've gone to many Wendy's in a few different states.  By far, this had to be the worst food and service.  The girl was nice, but when you order a taco salad a fork is necessary.  Nope, not one.  But the spoon for the chili that accompanied the salad was spot one.  The fries were old and horrendous.  The tops of the burger buns were hard.  Not the bottom buns, just the top ones.  We were all too worn out to call or get back there to complain, so I ate my salad with a spoon.  Unique experience to say the least.  One question I have for Wendy's employees.  At quite a few when I've asked for sweet n low, they've given me the yellow and the pink stuff.  If you don't know which to give, why not just ask what color and save the yellow for the Splenda fan!  Big thumbs down..."}
{"text":"Ridiculous. Me and my boyfriend waited in line for over 10 mins being the third car. When we finally got to the order screen she didn't say anything to let us know to hold on, so while we are waiting we are getting more and more angry at how long it's been. Then we finally say hello. Then then yells \"HOLD ON\". I asked her why she didn't tell us to before? She said she wasn't wearing her headset. Why would she take her headset off at any time? We left and told her it was all crap because how long she waited to take our order. Won't be back! Thanks Wendy's."}
{"text":"I come here a lot since I work in the area and it's usually fast, the staff is great and barring a few issues with specifically requesting no mayonnaise and being treated to a nice dollop (which hasn't happened in months and was quickly corrected once it was brought to their attention), this is my favorite quick stop for lunch... The sanitation grade stays high (which is more than I can say for some other places around it) and I have yet to experience an unhappy or rude staff person...  I also enjoy the croutons that come with the side salad... Garlic, sea salt and pepper seasoned... That's what I call straight awesomeness..."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this location...  The service was quick and friendly and the sandwich I ordered came with no mayonnaise...   The only thing that worried me was that I couldn't see the sanitation grade in the window (checked it out in the drive thru and turns out it was a 97, so that made me feel much better...)  The lettuce, though? Good grief, people... I'm ever so glad you washed it before you put it on my sandwich, but could you at least give it a run through a salad spinner or hang it to dry before you stick it in there?  It wasn't bad, though... The burger was hot, quick and didn't give me food poisoning... Just the way I like it..."}
{"text":"I usually come here when I crave a chocolate frosty & fries!   I love their frosty, it makes me smile just even thinking about it. Fond memories. Drive-thru is quick and efficient. I am usually in & out of the place in a few minutes.  When I do want more food items other than a frosty, I would usually order the kids chicken nuggets meal & it has everything but smaller and a cheaper price.    Service is normal in any fast food chain and they are friendly.  I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"I don't frequent fast food restaurants that often and every time I go to one, it reminds me why I don't want to go back. This location is by work so I stopped here once for a quick lunch of chicken nuggets because I was running late. They were horrible (greasy and just tasted nasty), I ended up throwing most of them away. Today was the second time I've been here...all we wanted was a couple Frostys. We ran in because there was a long line of cars at the drive thru, that was a mistake. The guy working the counter was super slow, and had no rhyme or reason the order he would do things. Can we just get our Frostys!? I can see about 4 other people in the back taking care of drive thru orders, why is no one helping this slow poke working the counter? Oh and the whole time I'm thinking about how stinky the inside is...it smelled of old people and potatoes. Weird. At least my Frosty, I waited 15 minutes for was good, well not 15 minutes good. Even though I have a free Frosty key fob I will never get one again, just to avoid these types of places. (Insert puking head emoji)"}
{"text":"This place is well -sanitized and has enough space to host lots of customers on rush hours. It even has wonderful terrace seats. You know that it's very hard to find that kind of virtues around here.   Wendy's cheese burger is definitely delicious. Its patty is so juicy and breads are soft. Drink option is cool, too. You can have free ice tea in side bar.  My only complaint is the size of burger. Isn't it too small?????? I am an Asian girl and don't eat too much but still..... I wasn't satisfied with the amount of it."}
{"text":"I freaking hate coming here. You sit in line forever. I've been sitting in line for almost 20 minutes. Needs new management or training. And I can understand some times but this is all the time I come here. Only at night. Please retrain your staff or get more help. Service is horrible."}
{"text":"I have never given a really bad star before but the Gentleman who took my order was the rudest person I've ever been ordered on. No personality what so ever and didn't even say thank you nor smile, Sir if you hate your job so much then you should leave, I've always came to this Wendys and everyone was so nice, what happened!?"}
{"text":"This is your typical Wendy's setup and menu offerings. The parking lot out front is full if aviation geeks enjoying the blast of fresh jet wash.  Service is quick and efficient. There are a few power ports scattered at both front and back but their WiFi needs a lot of work.. Got connected but never strong enough to open any websites."}
{"text":"This place has been here forevere, mainly serving the consumers road workers for lunch.  The interior decor  reflects the age.  There is a very small order counter and service is slowish compared to other locations.  This location does not serve up any free WiFi and the prices charged do no reflect the prices on the menu, so ask for the order bill to reconcile your order."}
{"text":"shouldn't a baconator have bacon on it? hey man, that's false advertising. tried to call the store to talk to the manager because we went through the drive thru and the phone rang and rang. I don't go to fast food when I have time to sit and eat."}
{"text":"We were leaving Charlotte on our way back to Greensboro and decided to grab some Wendy's. Unfortunately this was the one we happened upon.   When we pulled up to the window it took over 3 minutes for the employee to greet us with an unceremonious \"Go ahead with your order.\" After my husband got out his order she immediately asked if that was all. He then recited my request, at which point she hurriedly rambled off the total without confirming the order for accuracy and advised us to pull around to the second window to pay.  Upon reading the receipt, we noticed there were a few items that we'd been overcharged for. When the employee returned to the window she explained that they were out of natural lemonade, which we'd ordered and been charged an extra $1 for. She proceeded to hand us two \"pink lemonades,\" which would have been fine if a. they were actually pink lemonades, and b. if pink lemonade had the same up-charge.   The \"pink lemonades\" wound up being strawberry lemonade. My husband is super allergic to strawberries so this was a pretty egregious assumption on their part. When I explained that we couldn't drink these and wanted back the $1 for the up-charge, she caught a nasty attitude to the point that we had to address it to her.   She finally understood our request and sarcastically asked, \"so you want $.60 back?\" I said, \"No, I want our $1.06 back for *both* drinks and two fruit punches instead.\" You could hear her clearly yelling through the restaurant about our request before she finally returned to the window with the new drinks and our $1.06. She practically dropped the money into the car and muttered \"have a nice day\" under her breath as she closed the window.   The fries were cold and barely salted. All of the food was surprisingly cold, despite us being the only people at the restaurant, in the drive through or dining in. The bacon was undercooked and the bun was stiff.   Overall this Wendy's deserves a zero. Slow service from a rude staff and cold food. Do yourself a favor and just go to the McDonald's next door."}
{"text":"That's right.. Im writing about a Wendys.  Well.. When you impress me on all levels, this is what you get.  Well done Wendys.  Food came out looking like it does in the commercials and ever so fast.  The staff was friendly and experienced.  Annnnnnndd it was delicious.  Enjoy! PS. I love you chocolate frosty. Ian M."}
{"text":"They got my order correct and the people there are super nice! The burger was delicious too! It was also pretty cheep. After reading the reviews we inspected our food and it was good! It was also really fast and almost had no wait time. It was great for the family too!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday at 6:30pm. They ran out of food! What a joke is this place. Employees brain dead and useless."}
{"text":"Horrible Wendy's. Never have I experienced what I experienced today at any Wendy's. The service was horrible, took forever to get my food and its was poorly made.   I posted pictures of the Spicy Chicken sandwich that was given to me. The Chili Cheese fried that were given to me went straight from my tray to the trash can. I should have taken a picture and posted it as well but I was so enraged. They failed to properly describe their Chili Cheese Fries. They were more like Soupy Chili Cheese fries. My fries were swimming in something that appeared to be chili broth. Yes chili broth does exist because I saw it today. Poor fries needed a life vest and the cheese....... don't even know how to describe it. Had they stirred their cheese sauce it would of been OK but you could tell they didn't stir before serving. It looked like it had cellulites."}
{"text":"The entire staff I dealt with today is very rude. They won't look at you they look like they hate their lives and they barely say one word. I said thank you 12 times before the lady had my food force her you're welcome with so little enthusiasm I thought she was dead. Then I sat there and went through everything to make sure I had everything and she looked annoyed. But I had no idea whether not she was was done or if I had everything because she didn't say a word."}
{"text":"So we went thru the drive thru at 10:50 pm  Generally when I go through drive thrus I expect normally basic service,  quick interactions  But my man Wesley not only made my trip to Wendy's delightful but he also made my trip to Wendy's one of the most memorable trip to Wendy's I've ever had  They need to give that man a raise  He deserves it  He's Super outgoing and super talented!  I normally only yelp bad reviews but I had to yelp this fantastic one  I don't care about its 2star past they deserve a 5 stars from this trip alone  Wesley my man if you're reading this  I LOVE YOU!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but your star rating has gone down yet again. They are always screwing up orders. I might just have to start going to another location, because it has not gotten any better."}
{"text":"Continuously order my sandwiches without cheese- and continuously they keep putting cheese on my burgers and messing up orders.  The managers will make it right but I hate calling all the time telling them they screwed up."}
{"text":"Being ignored by the girl at your front counter, and told there are no refills on green tea is ridiculous.  I spent $9.20 on a small combo, was charged extra for green tea(which is fine) and not allowed one small refill?  Since when? If it wasn't for the young man behind this girl,(Who could see I was being ignored) I would have left, and not ordered.  When Dave died, I see Wendy's customer service died with him.  Wave goodbye to a 40 year customer.  I hope your policy of no refills on a small green tea was worth it to you!  The manager emailed me, and told me this is policy on a premium drink.  No refills.  I'll go to Sweet Tomatoes, or Panera where green tea refills are unlimited."}
{"text":"One Star because the service was friendly and fast and the food was on par with usual Wendy's quality.   However, there were flies everywhere inside. When ordering, two flies buzzing around both me and the associate taking my order. The guy taking the order even commented on them. Yikes.   Once seated, I spotted four flies at once on the window at one point. Double yikes.   I hate to drag down Wendy's because it's my favorite of the fast food chains as far as burger quality but.... yikes. Probably won't return to this location. Trash was also overflowing and counters by the drink machine were gross. Yikes."}
{"text":"When it comes to fast food, I say Wendy's is superior. The burgers feel more like actual burgers than McDonald's or Burger King. This location has always been prompt and clean inside when I check it out. Bathrooms were also nice and clean. It's definitely a newer model for a Wendy's.. hip inside with wifi now."}
{"text":"We dined in this time.  Service was fast and friendly. Food was very good. Dining room was as clean as it could be for a busy Saturday afternoon"}
{"text":"This location is tough in and out, but they get the order right.  You know the menu.   There's no surprises here. No need for me to go over it.  The employees are great.  Your order will be correct.  Now, good luck getting back in traffic."}
{"text":"Haven't had Wendy's in a long time, I had been given a gift card, so I thought I'd try out the \"improved burgers\".  I had the bacon cheese burger combo, now you can choose from many options instead of fries you can add a salad, or baked potato.  I had the fries.    The burger is really very good, it was made fresh, they toasted the bun, it had a couple of thick apple smoked bacon strips, pickles, lettus and tomato.  I enjoyed it very much, it reminded me of the home style my mom made us as kids!"}
{"text":"I like Wendy's. Of all the fast food joints Wendy's is one of my choices just because, in my opinion, their burgers taste much better. I've seen my fair share of good Wendys', bad Wendys' and Wendys' where crass cashiers with too much make up and hoola hoop for earrings are allowed to engage in crass, insulting and demeaning arguments with their customer and are then protected by their managers.  This Wendy's is dead smack in the middle with maybe a few fractions of a degree tilting towards good. Not because they are actually good but because in the fast food industry if you don't majorly suck, you're leaning towards good.  I actually went through the drive through and we were helped with a very nice \"Thank you for choosing Wendy's, 'can' I take your order\" which already beats 99% of other similar establishments and their usual, \"Take y'order\" greeting. We pulled around, paid and politely were told to pull ahead as one of our items was being \"put together\". Fair enough.  We waited no more than a couple of minutes and our food came right out to our window. Overall a good, fast and accurate experience.  Then I realized why Wendy's is known as a BURGER JOINT.  I ordered a Crispy Chicken Caesar Wrap. The wrapper, for whatever reason was soaked in, what I hoped, was water but fortunately the wrap itself was dry. Not a bad taste except for the actual Caesar dressing which was too strong and salty for my taste. And I love salty food!  I also ordered the half Berry Almond Chicken Salad which was a nice portion (I couldn't finish it). It was as decent as any pre-packaged salad with Raspberry syrup disguised as salad dressing can be. The chicken was a little too spiced for me... not spicy, but whatever spices they used for the chicken it just had too much. The entire thing was very bland but exceptionally the blueberries. The salad also had some flat, white, tasteless strips of what I thought was Provolone cheese but turned out to be Asiago. It really didn't add much to the salad. I couldn't detect the almond flavor even though I felt the crunch of the almonds as I chewed. The strawberries on the other hand were nice, big, plump and nicely sweet.  At $4.50 thought? I think I overpaid a buck fiddy...  From now on, I'm sticking to burger though."}
{"text":"Thanks so much for the good service ! Got  extra fries and lots of ketchup, woohoo! :)"}
{"text":"It was under construction for a while so the inside hadn't been open. But everytime i stop here for a quick meal everything is always fresh and the staff is always friendly !!"}
{"text":"JUST DONT! Our fries had more hair in them than a shower drain. This is the second time we've come through this location in the last year... it's clear there is poor management here. I'm he man in the window was friendly. But whoever is working the fryer needs to put their hair up. That's disgusting!"}
{"text":"I didn't like it at all, bad customer service, food wasn't good and not well made plus the sandwiches had no lettuce!! Not a happy customer!!  can't wait to get back to the Californian Wendy's!!"}
{"text":"Straight to the point:  It was 5:15am.  I have a groggy wife and two half asleep 3 yr olds I'm dragging through Charlotte airport.  (What the hell was I thinking when I planned this trip?)  Anyway, I couldn't stop at the Starbucks because I was carrying the heavier of the two girls with one hand and two \"hello kitty\" backpacks in the other. (Crying, f'n shame). I finally got the family settled at our departure gate and I went a huntn' for some joe. Our flight was about to board so hiking back to the Starbucks just wasn't an option, not to mention the line might have made me miss my flight altogether and that's the LAST thing I needed. I looked to my left and saw a glimmer of hope .... A Wendy's that served coffee. After some quick airport time math I decided that this was my best option. Great decision. I walked up to the counter and ordered a large cup of dark goodness.  The woman at the counter looked at me, smiled, looked at the empty coffee mug I was carrying and said \"how 'bout I just fill that up\".  Now that's what I'm talking about!  Quality customer service!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Well I guess you shouldn't come here during lunch rush. I came at 3pm on a Tuesday and everything was great. Destiny was the cashier and was super nice and explained the new jr bacons for me.. it's been awhile Wendy's.  Got through the line and got my food in under 5 minutes. No problems with the food. The 4 for 4 is a good deal when you're on the move. No bad experiences for me and hate seeing all the negative things that have happened for other folks that have came here."}
{"text":"'Pulled into the drive thru late this evening when all of the lights were on inside and out.    Waited five minutes to place an order.  No one answered.    Pulled forward around the corner of the building and saw two cars in front of the window.    So I backed up and waited a few more minutes at the speaker.  Still no answer.    Disgusted, I backed out of the drive thru lane. No sooner than doing so, the lights on the signs turn off.   Apparently they were ready to close, but didn't have the guts to simply say on the speaker that they were closing.    Sure, I would have been disappointed, but I wouldn't be taking the time now to leave one star -- which is one more than the manager this evening deserves."}
{"text":"I came here during the afternoon about a month ago to get a quick snack before I had to head off to work. I went through the drive thru and had to wait a little less than 5 minutes to order. The employee who took my order was nice, quick and made sure everything was correct. Once I arrived to the window I was handed my food (I just got an order or French fries) and saw there were no condiments. I was a little surprised by that so I asked if I could get ketchup. The employee handed it to me and didn't seem too happy to be doing so. You would assume if you are getting fries they would ask if you want sauce? Overall, I probably will skip Wendy's when I'm in need of food. The fries were a little cold and had no flavor at all."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this Wendy's has such poor reviews. This location is much better than the one over in Lawrenceville. The staff was friendly and our order came quickly. It was around lunch time and the drive thru looked busy as usual so we ate dine in.   I look for a few things when judging a fast food dine in experience: friendliness, cleanliness, and time spent waiting for order.  This one was relatively clean with the exception of a few pieces of trash on the floor. The cashier greeted us quickly and took our order. When our food was ready the lady that brought it out was nice as well. My sandwich was impeccably made. First time I've had a decent fast food sandwich. I got the spicy chicken. Wendy's is probably one of my favorite fast food locations and I was not disappointed at this one."}
{"text":"The redhead I believe her name is Rachael is just standing around do nothing but talking. Fast food should always have something to do. Stocking, dishes, cleaning. Tables were dirty. Fast service from Will and Niki. Cashier is doing her job, she's stocking. Cheese on my burger was cold."}
{"text":"As far as Wendy's go, this is a nice location.  It offers a fireplace and all menus are updated on LCD screens.  The whole place has a nice feel to it and even offers the new coke machines where you have a ton of options to choose from.  I will be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"The service at this location has gone down hill as of late. I took my Mom here to eat today, and arrived a little after 11 am. No one in the place but us.Stood at the counter about 10 minutes before someone finally came up to take our order. Then had to wait another 15 minutes for the food, like they were open but not ready for any customers. Also, Wendy's really need to revamp the way they refill drinks. You have to go back to the counter and wait for some one to refill your drink in between filling the food orders. Why should you have to stand there and wait when 99.99% of all fast food chains have a self serve refill station or two. I stood there waiting while some girl was filling orders. I know she saw me standing there, but never offered me a refill. Finally got a refill from another employee. C'mon Wendys, get with the times and install a self serve refill station so customers won't have to stand in a long line waiting on refills."}
{"text":"Not the safest one in the world, had a guy walk up on me for some money. People just standing around not going any where never a great sign. And they always forget your straw."}
{"text":"Horrible service rude people the Manager Kimberly needs to be fired she's racist on black People when I placed the order I can  already tell she didn't wanna serve me I give her a $20 bill and there was a Little rip not even noticeable she decline my bill for a horrible excuse ...but I know she's racist will never go there again and hope no dark skin people goes there because there going to get horrible service and get embarrassed!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a dump, and it's staffed by the indolent.  It's filthy; they're slow.  Go someplace that stands a chance of having been cleaned and swept at least sometime in the prior week and where the people \"serving\" you speak English with a smile."}
{"text":"Rude and nasty service at the drive-thru! Whoever was taking the order was very curt and not in the least bit friendly bordering on contempt. I ordered nuggets and fries and everything was stone cold. When I asked to have new food that wasn't cold I was given a terrible attitude from the employee.  I will NEVER return to this location."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's, & never really had a problem before, until the other night. I decided to stop in & try their new Buttermilk chicken sandwich, because their commercial on it looked so good. Wow, was I so wrong!!!!!!!!! 1st of all, I paid $4.49 for just the sandwich...it was so small, I thought they gave me the chicken sand off the dollar menu! Also, their was nothing buttermilk about it..it was so spicy, I could hardly eat it, ontop of it being very dry, as they did'nt put any type of sauce on it..I put mayo on it when I got home! Very disappointing, because the commercial made me have high expectations..instead it was like getting $1 spicy chicken sand & paid $4.50 for it!!!!!!!!!!!! :("}
{"text":"I know it is silly to give a Wendy's a 5-star review but really, this is the greatest Wendy's of all time.  The food is typical Wendy's food.  It doesn't taste any better or worse than it should and that is just fine.  The reason this place rocks is because of the service, particularly, the Drive-Thru.  Let me play this scenario out for you.  You pull up and order your meal. Girl on the speaker says $2.90 at the first window. As you get up to the first window, you hand her $3 in cash...she already has a dime in her hand and gives it to you while saying \"second window.\" As you pull up to the second window, you barely have time to press the brake because the guy at the second window is there with your bag of food hanging out ready for you to grab it as you drive by.  I can literally go through this Wendy's drive-thu in under 30 seconds.  It is amazing.  They couldn't be faster if I called ahead.    Considering how little time many of us get for lunch, a place like this is really a blessing.  The manager who trains his staff to perform so well should be commended. I love this Wendy's!"}
{"text":"It's Wendy's. But I favor this one over others. I usually come here when I want something quick on the way home. I have to say, sometimes it's slower than other times but one thing I can commend these employees on is the friendliness and accuracy of my order. I don't think I've ever had my meal wrong or ever not been greeted at the window. For me, it's the small and simple things I appreciate."}
{"text":"From the outside the place looks nice, but management is lacking here. The employees are rude and lethargic. The food was absolutely disgusting which I didn't know it was possible to mess up fast food."}
{"text":"My friend got a salad Here today for lunch and she is pregnant. There was a huge dead moth inside of it and she ate some of it before she realized what was in it... I can't believe they let that happen. It is so disgusting and they didn't even offer a good solution. She called the store manager and he just offered a bigger free salad. Why would she even want to get another salad there, ever?!? We are definitely never eating at this location again."}
{"text":"This review is pretty much for the limited time Chicken Flat bread.  I really liked this sandwich.  It is better than their hamburgers.  Quite a lot of flavor.  I hope to see it back soon.  Not much else to brag about this place.  The salads and chili are just maybe ok."}
{"text":"I went to this location maybe a month ago and I was genuinely surprised on how great of customer service they gave the window cashier was so funny and helpful. I loved it. And you can never go wrong with the salads so all in all it was amazing"}
{"text":"This place is always dirty. Tables not cleared, things all over the floor. The drink station is a total wreck. Health Dept. Needs to pay a visit."}
{"text":"15 minutes from ordering to food. Most of the order is either wrong or missing.   Wendies in West View is terrible, my advvice. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"They consistently forget items in your order. If you use a kiosk and ask to add tomato or extra cheese they will just give you the basic version.   Go for lunch every day and honestly 2/3 times I order they forget something on in the order.  Today and the reason im writing this review, I ordered a crispy chicken wrap, and they forgot to add the chicken to it, was just a lettuce wrap.......  I'm tired of constantly having to check my order and going back to have it corrected."}
{"text":"I swear they need to get a new manager in that joint shouldn't have update the place even though it needed but they need update the owner and manager continuous of stupid and messed up orders and I don't get why it's so hard,  I even had a manger apologies said to me that they're going through 20 crew a week which somehow that's my problem or I'm suppose to understand hell no get your shit together or I'm filing to get rid of this Wendy out of Belmont going on for 10+ yrs of stupidity"}
{"text":"Watch yourself here if you're a pedestrian. You have to cross a couple drive-thru's to get in the door.  The cashier here was super friendly. They got my order right and they had it out to me quickly. The restaurant was clean and other than a couple obnoxious customers a few tables away the experience was great."}
{"text":"I've only ever come through the drive-thru here. For how busy of a shopping centre this is I've never had to wait in line here. This might be because I've probably never hit this restaurant on a weekend.  Of the few visits I don't have any complaints. My food has always been hot and fresh. On my last visit I had a baked potato, which I haven't done for a while. I was pleasantly surprised that they still load them up with cheese and the cheese wasn't watery."}
{"text":"This restaurant is easily one of the busiest in the city during the weekly lunch rush. So your best to avoid the peak hours if you can. However, they always blast everyone through like mad so you won't have to wait too long.  My only complaint about this location is that they aren't open late. Its understandable based on their location, but when other locations are open til the wee hours you would expect the same of all locations."}
{"text":"Most days I find this location to be pretty good, especially when hitting up the drive-thru. On the weekends, the inside dining area can be a little crazy with everyone out shopping and running errands.   Speed of service is good generally and there is rarely a line in the drive-thru more than a couple of cars."}
{"text":"On a mad dash from Coventry to Springbank I zoomed through this drive-thru to grab lunch before getting to a job site. It was a little bit after they opened so my food was extremely fresh. At 10:30 in the morning there was no line and I was gone with my food in a flash.  My biggest complaint is that if you don't come into the parking lot from the right direction, the drive through is a nightmare to get into."}
{"text":"With the 58th Ave location not being open late, this is my go-to location to grab a couple of JBC's after work on my way to a poker game at my brother's place.  The drive-thru is always quick even into the night. Despite there always being a small line you almost never have to stop your car through your whole visit."}
{"text":"I ordered just a simple cheese burger with extra mayo and ketchup.. I take only one bite and find 2 hairs in my food, it's discusting. I rarely eat fast food but the time I do.. it was horrible. Throwed it out right away and kind of turned me off from eating in public in general.. ugh"}
{"text":"The food is consistent with what you expect from Wendy's; no complaints on quality of food. The service, however, is much slower than what you get at other Wendy's locations, consistently and across a long time. Not sure why they seem to have a harder time getting food out than other Wendy's. At least they usually get the order right."}
{"text":"While I don't review a lot of fast food places, I felt the need to talk about this one as it brings forth a point that I make about any and all fast food restaurants.  But first....  I'm not so much a fan of Wendy's burgers.  Flavor wise, they just don't do it for me.  I am, however, a fan of their chicken nuggets.  And I appreciate the variety on their dollar menu.  My recent discovery, the Cheesy Cheddar Burger is decent.  Not great, but certainly decent, and doable when you need a quick bite.  The place also gets points for having a nice staff.  I've had good experiences with the staff through every transaction here, and they are helpful and friendly.  I don't ask for a lot, but they do a fine job.  So what is this \"point\"?  I don't eat fast food vegetables.  Period.  And I was reminded this when I tried their value menu Chicken Caesar Wrap.  I guess you could point out a \"Well, what do you expect for a dollar\" comment, but I DON'T expect brown, wilty lettuce.  So I turned my meal into a chicken wrap, minus the caesar.    Heh.  I guess you could say that I came to bury caesar, not to praise him.  Come on.  Groan all you want, but I had a great opportunity to add that.  How could I not?  Well, Wendy's, we'll always have chicken nuggets...."}
{"text":"Worst wendys ever!! Just like everyone says this place sucks.manager is rude and unhelpful with all my cold food.then went and microwaved my fries to heat them up."}
{"text":"Wendy's new burgers are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better.  I love the thicker cut and the new butter buns.  That sounded dirty but seriously they are a night and day difference.  Pair that with the seasalt fries and for fast food you got a nice meal.  I will for sure be back.    oh and p.s. the caramel apple parfait frosty is good but it's really small compared to what you think you may be getting and for the price it's not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Slow,  incorrect orders,  and the don't give your receipt - which makes disputes improbably long"}
{"text":"This place is just as bad as mcdonalds. It isn't good at all and the food tastes so processed. I got a grilled chicken salad and it tasted so gross and I threw it away. This eatery is very gross and needs to be shut down and inspected for food poisoning. It's not just the food that's gross, it's the inside of the food place too."}
{"text":"So tonight I decided to go to Wendy's and try a lemonade, as I went through the drive-thru , I ordered my drink when I received it I saw something floating in it so I looked closer and it was a freaking bug !  wth !!! It was soo gross  but they did give me back my money ."}
{"text":"They can never get my order right!! Ok, and does anyone else think this is stupid? I ordered a Hamburger, plain.  What I received was a cheeseburger. I took it back up to the counter and said I ordered a hamburger. Cashier said they do not have hamburgers...um what? So your sign that says \"famous for hamburgers\" you do not have those? She said, to get a plain burger you have to order a cheeseburger with no cheese. You have got to be kidding me. They are getting two stars because (so far) they have not messed up my chicken nuggets and I love the honey mustard..and frosty's."}
{"text":"Horrible. Awful sanitation rating. I was the ONLY ONE IN DRIVE THRU and it took TEN MIN to come on to take my order! Then I had to repeat my 4 dollar items...super awkward. Coke tasted like syrupy piss. Never again."}
{"text":"This Wendy's has been on a down hill slid for awhile . They have now hit the bottom in my book. My wife and I stopped in for lunch and it was the worst yet. You had to hunt the chili and slaw on her Carolina classic, and the chili was so runny on mine that most of it was on the wrapper. We were hoping for Carolina classics that looked like the picture of one on the window. There was now resemblance. Her fries were stone cold my chili was thin as soup. The frostys were great, but how could you mess up a frosty they are dispensed out of a machine."}
{"text":"After reading some of these reviews I'm glad to know I'm not the only one who thinks this Wendy's is horrible.  My hubby and I have come here at least 5 times since living close by here and every single time we come we come thru the drive-thru and  they never have anything ready.  We have to wait for 5 to 10 min for the food. Sometimes the food doesn't even taste fresh and they are always missing something in our order.  I don't know how hard it is for the employees to work there or what they're doing in there to mess up orders and not have fresh food ready but this location needs to get it together.  My husband and I said we weren't coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"This is a typical Wendys with a drive thru and a Tim Hortons attached.  It is a busy location, located at highway 10 and Britannia.  The burgers are typical of Wendys. This is the only Wendy's still open until 2 am in the area so it is good to come here for midnight snacks."}
{"text":"This location is open 24 hrs and is located in Heartland area. Since I do like the very occasional burger, I do step in here once is a while to fix my craving.  My standard order is the burger combo with a baked potato instead of fries. The sour cream is a must have for the baked potato.  Due to my recent health issues, I now have to forgo my goto order of bacon deluxe burger which is delicious! I am drooling writing this....  One thing is during the summer months, you can find lots of street racer type cars in the big parking lot and it is an informal gathering spot for these car lovers."}
{"text":"Convenient location right by the Erin Mills Town Centre Mall. The also have a Timmies in the same building so that you can kill 2 birds with one stone and get some nice fresh coffee  to go with your burger!  Nothing much I can add to a Wendy's review except that I have a burger craving once a couple of months and more so when I am travelling in the USA."}
{"text":"This is a typical Wendy's location but with a difference...it comes with a view of aircraft landing at YYZ from the parking lot!  The interior is uninspiring and dated.  The food is typical Wendy's corporate standard which is  a OK.  Good to come here with the kids on a weekend just for the 'view' in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"This place has not gotten any better over the past 10 years. The service is still bad and they are always running out of food and the food isn't that great either.  Will have to say that I will not be going back to this location or the one off of Glendale and 19th ave."}
{"text":"Worst service ever I ordered my food at 7:40pm didn't receive it until 8:40pm no exaggeration. This is the slowest Wendy's I kno in az"}
{"text":"Every now and then, I crave a Wendy's Double Stack.  Today was one of those days.  The Double Stack clocks in at $1.99 nowadays, but it's still a great price for a small, compact, but juicy, beefy burger.  They come topped with mustard, ketchup, onion and pickle.  Pretty simple and pretty delicious.  2 of those and a small chocolate Frosty are a filling meal for just over $5.00.  I prefer Wendy's burgers over the other two big chains (McDonalds and Burger King), mainly because they cook your burger fresh, hot off the grill, every single time!   Drive thru lady was friendly and Wendy's ALWAYS has the fastest drive thru service of any fast food place.  I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Inside or outside?...Soup or salad?...Cheese or no cheese?...Blondes or Brunettes?  We all have our preferences and I am no different.  I have never had a relationship with a redhead go smoothly and Wendy is not an exception:(  She's never really been good to me, although she's occasionally surprised me with something fun and spicy (like a deep fried spicy chicken sandwich that will set your mouth on fire:)  But in the end, she's always been a bit of a disappointment...for a lot of reasons.  Wendy whispers sweet nothings in my ear...things like \"always fresh, never frozen\" and \"made when you order it\", yet the burgers are always dripping with moisture and grease...clearly partially cooked and then waiting in a bin next to the grill:(  Wendy always asks me \"how do you want it?\"...so coquettish...so provocative...so beguiling!  And yes... I do tell her how I want it...and she nearly always gets it wrong...clumsily...inconsiderately...often incoherently and unpleasantly wrong:(  I tell her she needs to make it right...and she makes an attempt to satisfy...but I can tell her heart isn't in it:(  I vow that I will not darken her door again, but then I find myself in a tight spot where Wendy is the only one that has what I need...right there...right then...and I succumb.  That was the situation last week...busy, busy, so very busy, last week!  Hard workout...needed a retoxing...almost late for a meeting...empty drive through lane at Wendy's...  Well, you can guess the rest yourself...no need for me to go into the sordid details...except to say that maybe I've gotten a little bit smarter about this crazy redhead...This time, I didn't pull out until I got exactly what I wanted:)   Pull out of the drive through...of the drive through...what did you think I meant?"}
{"text":"I had not been to Wendy's in.....forever. Went last week and tried their 1/2 Baja salad. It was really good. Then went again a few days ago and had the same thing and a potatoe. I like that they have the soda machines where you can get any flavor. They even have diet caffeine free vanilla coke and diet caffeine free cherry coke. The yhave remodeled several locations and it really doesn't flow well. Everything is all backed up, no way to escape. How about removing that wall so we can go sit down. Call us up when it's ready. Or for the people that are waiting for their to go order, let them have a special seating area to wait. They do have several seating areas and then some areas with tables and chairs."}
{"text":"WOW- the prices almost made me pass out. I like Wendy's though, and I was hungry, so it had to do.  Enjoyable food, clean food court, but way too expensive to want to come back."}
{"text":"April 19, 2011, btwn 1:30p.m - 2p.m, I drove thru Wendys drive thru and ordered #3. Then I asked the lady if it comes with the sea salted french fries and her reply was \" well thats the only fries we have\" in a sarcasm VOICE! The reason I asked, was because the last time I was there, the fries tasted just like the regular one! So I said, \"I was only asking\" and she was like \"wat else can I get for u\" she sounded so irritated! I cancelled my order and wen to Rally's where they were able to provide me with great customer service! You see, I've been in the customer service field for quite sometimes. I try to delive the best I can in helping customer in every other ways I can. I expect to be treated the same. No matter how Irate or grumpy the customer gets, I don't let it bother me. Theres a reason that their like that. So whatever issue that cashier was having that day, I hope she learns not to let things get to her easily. I won't let her treatment towards me stop me from going to Wendys, I will not go to their location."}
{"text":"Fix these hours!!! This location closes at 1 am.... not two. If you show up at moment after one the staff will be there but they wont be serving so dont be fooled by these hours"}
{"text":"There is nothing stellar about Wendy's but they get 4 stars for the magic right outside their front door. You can pop right out with a frosty in hand and enjoy an amazing vantage point of the airplanes landing into Pearson airport. See them coming in every 2 minutes and if you're lucky you might spot a jumbo jet descending towards you!"}
{"text":"Located in the T-4 D gates this is the place to stop for your super large super cheap iced coffee.   I also like picking up a snack or small breakfast sandwich depending on the time of day I am rolling through here.    Having over anticipated the time I needed to get through security I had plenty of time to walk from my C gate to the D gates to pick up something.  I have had no porblems with the service or food quality on the couple of stops I have made at this Wendy's."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a LARGE iced coffee and a breakfast biscut sandwich.  The iced coffee was much larger than most coffee shops and hit the spot.   The drive thru was busy but the restaurant inside had a small family enjoying breakfast and me.  I found the location to be clean and the service friendly.  Oh yeah and the bacon for my breakfast, real bacon, I'm impressed."}
{"text":"Got coupon flyer in the mailbox. First visit was for the new Big Chicken sandwich. It was OK for what it was. 2nd time was a little while earlier today ~3pm. Ordered two spice chicken sandwiches w/wheat buns. One came w/teh new bun, and both seemed like they'd been made a while ago - not at all crispy & quite rubbery. I should have known as the order came out real quick, but my mind was on getting home - I was hungry.  The cashier was a sharp young man, and though the fries were OK, I doubt I'll be back soon, if ever..."}
{"text":"Only gets one star because there's nothing lower. The employees clearly do not understand what customer service is. They have a huge attitude and they also seem very un-energetic. Usually in my experience, employees make the customer the priority. After getting a handful of fries, even though I ordered medium, they made no effort to fix my complaint. They just said that's how it's supposed to be. Never coming back here until all those people are fired."}
{"text":"Okay I LOVE Wendy's. But. . . they got my order wrong.   i live around this location so if I go for Wendy's it'll be here. The location seems trustworthy as for cleanliness then YES it's acceptable.   Customer service:The worst. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the cashier staring at me. That's the first thing that happened when I walked in. WEIRD. And he didn't stop. I also ordered one bruger got another WAY different. So I to get the one I wanted I had to pay the difference. It all came out for $9. I hate the help here.   Now that's very expensive for a burger but that's business. I guess. . . It's clean and the love the food. Even through the drive through people get weird. But It's better than going in there. Ahh but make sure to check your things before you leave. Make sure it's what your ordered."}
{"text":"I'm not a fast food burger guy at all.  It's been 17 years since I actually ate a Big Mac and at least 4 years since dining at a Wendy's.  But there was a coupon in the mail for their new \"Hot 'N Juicy\" (the jokes you could start in with are endless!!) burger and we went after some pleading from the wife.  I did read in an article about how the Wendy's executives scoured the country for the top burgers, spent thousands of dollars on research and this is what they considered their best effort after a year of trials.  So I was definitely curious.  We did drive thru and ate in the car since my wife was wearing a Batgirl costume (Yelp Justice League Pub Crawl on Fremont).  Our coupon was for a free single patty Hot 'N Juicy with the purchase of a small drink and small fries.  The bill appropriately for 2 orders totaled $6.66!  The verdict: Not bad but not great either.  If you like Wendy's menu, you will most likely enjoy this.  I would prefer a Whopper if I am blowing massive amounts of calories and fat on a fast food joint."}
{"text":"I went to Wendy's to get a vanilla Frosty today and wouldn't you know it, I was told they were out of Vanilla Frosty's.  I settled for a green tea instead.  It was not what I wanted to get, but it was a nice alternative on a hot Vegas day.    The location itself is easy to get in and out of, and the inside of the establishment was very clean.  I was in and out in just minutes, while the same vehicle was still at the drive thru order sign (glad I decided to walk in) since the line behind the undecided patrons was now getting pretty long.  I'll have to come back to try some of their food items in the future so I can give an updated review.  For now though, I'll keep them on my list of \"A-OK\" places to get a refreshing drink, hopefully next time, their vanilla Frosty machine will be back in service."}
{"text":"All the food I had met expectations for wendys but I was not too impressed with the staff. They forgot multiple items that I didn't notice was missing until I got home, both drinks I ordered were only filled up about 2/3 full, and the fries that came with the meals weren't even halfway filled! Definitely felt a little cheated as Wendy's combos are a little more pricey then its competitors; with that being said all the food was enjoyable still."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back here, thirty minutes waiting on the drive thru just to be ignored by the people \"working\" inside it's not the first time that this happens.  I don't know the working arrangement that the workers have if they get paid overtime past closing time or what. But they stop serving customers about forty five minutes before closing time.  How is this happening? I don't know but I'm going to find a small,  no chain, mom and pops Burger joint."}
{"text":"It's Wendy's but I have to say I love their Apple Pecan chicken salad and the new W burger.  This location appears to have all new staff and a new face lift because we have had few issues in the past couple of months.  And we are starting to get to know the employees that work the Drive-thru.  Haven't had a W burger yet?  May I suggest you try one."}
{"text":"Horrible service! A store full of employees, most of whom  work at a snail's pace. This store is in desperate need of a management overhaul."}
{"text":"Normally come here because it's close to work. Good for that fast meal. But man I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken was barely there. So hard, could barely swallow it. Yuck! Last time I order this off their menu."}
{"text":"You get 1 star. You deserve 0. Your manager Brent is a lazy horrible supervisor.  You guys messed up my order. I ordered a taco salad and got home with no taco chips.  I had to come all the way back.  Not only did you not apologize for messing up my order.  You didnt even offer to remake me other food that had gotten cold. Due to the unprofessional behavior I decided I just wanted my money back. Gave them all the cold food and left.  I have been coming here for years. The turn over rate is high. The old crew were much better. Wont be back to this one."}
{"text":"One star due to rude service in the drive through line.   I just pulled up and said \"one second\" bc I haven't seen the menu yet and the girl made a rude comment and said \"oh well\".   She did not seem happy to be working.   Left a bad impression."}
{"text":"One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food."}
{"text":"Hated it! There was a red ink like thing on my burger. Garbage cans were full. Never again.  Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly newly renovated Wendy's.  Wendys is always pretty decent fast food.  I personally enjoy their chicken sandwiches over burgers.  When I do Wendys generally I order off of their extensive dollar menu."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever. Staff didn't know how to work the computer. Never will be back here again. Now I'm late for work. My entire order was wrong. Wrong nuggets, wrong sandwich and wrong drink x2. Jamie should be fired."}
{"text":"Service is soooo slow here  It looked like chaos back there  It took over 15 minutes for our sandwiches and the line kept forming  Plus I had to wait for my drink while my food got cold and they were out of ketchup  They were super nice but understaffed"}
{"text":"I roll through their drive-thru on those nights when the kids must be fed, but I'm not cooking. They send frequent coupons in the neighborhood weekly mailers, which come in handy when you like saving a buck (which is always).   I've never had a problem with an order or worker attitude here. That's not taking away from anyone else's experience, but it just luckily hasn't happened to me.   The kids like their frosty desserts, chicken sandwiches and nuggets.  If you're vegan, you can eat a plain baked potato, french fries, or a side salad with their red Italian dressing. Personally, I only get their fries.  But word on the street is that they've been test-marketing a vegan black-bean burger option, so fingers crossed that it's rolled out nationwide."}
{"text":"RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF.   This is my second time when Im getting off of work at the hospital and running across a fool talking to me (crazy) in the drive thru line..  This time I decided to my money down the street to Arby's...   I am calling the corporate office in the morning, to deal with these people..."}
{"text":"I'm a dollar menu whore.  One chicken sandwich please.  Here's your $1.09.  NEXT!   They want $1.98 or something ridiculous for a large soda. Next time I'm bringing my own $.25 can of pop.  The food is Wendy's.  Better than average fast food burgers (or $1 chicken sandwiches) I guess."}
{"text":"Crack.  I think that is the secret ingredient in their strawberry milkshakes.  To tell the truth, I don't eat fast food much.  But for some reason, these milkshakes make me feel like a junkie.  I'm like \"Milkshake, milkshake, must have, now!\" and so I rush to get one (large, always).  As soon as I start drinking it, I know that the taste is really unnatural but I KEEP DRINKING ANYWAYS.   And then the cycle repeats. Seriously, what are in these things!?"}
{"text":"Extremely unfriendly drive-thru staff, no customer service, and unwelcoming. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"If you come here, don't expect the staff at the drive through to listen to your order. Even if you correct them, they don't listen and mess it up. If you ask for any special, MINUTE changes, they cant handle it. Double check your order before leaving the lot, and only stick to indoor ordering where they were much more attentive. The black woman serving drive through today may 25th at 12:45-12:55pm, she does not listen and only wanted to get everyone out of line with no quality control whatsoever."}
{"text":"Updated interior.  Nice seats, fake fireplace.  Custom coke machine that you can have nearly any kind of pop you want, and custom Dave's flavors too.  I had the bacon portabella melt burger with poutine.  Very good. The burger is a limited time deal and is excellent. Highly recommend.  Poutine is always good here."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its lack of stars! Tall light skinned girl at the register was coughing in her hand and scratching her face while giving me change. Horrible attitude to top it all off. If you hate your job, get an education and do better for yourself. Don't take your personal hate for yourself out on the customers. Needs better management here."}
{"text":"Good chili and a nice fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"Horrible! Absolutely the worse service I've ever received! Order in the drive thru, screen didn't work so I was unable to see the guy didn't get the order correct! I ordered a JBC meal with only meat and cheese no mayo or veggies. When we received our food we pulled out of the way checked the order the Double bacon burger had mayo and all the toppings. My daughter went back in and explained we only wanted the the meat, cheese and bacon. The nice girl at the front register told the blonde girl that was cooking in the back. Gave back the burger assuming it would be done correct.  I opened the burger to make sure and only one piece of hamburger! When the JBC comes with 2 meats! My daughter took it back in and the blonde girl in the back started mouthing and running her mouth and being very disrespectful! My daughter said this is the third time why are you blaming us for your mistake? She was just being a smart ass! Unable to hear what she was saying since the wood panel is there! My daughter brought hamburger back out to car I checked again! Omg still only one piece of meat! I went in the girl at the counter said oh wow again! She was sweet and apologetic!! She took hamburger back to snobby girl! Again major attitude I said then do your job correct why should I have to come back inside 4 times! It's 2 pieces of meat not one!!! I want what I paid for she was still being a smart ass but of course I was unable to hear what she was saying! Geno was telling her just do it!!'  The front girl brought it back ,blonde girl mouthing for me to check right there \"like acting like I am take my a hamburger patty off before I came in each time\"!!i told the counter girl that the blonde is the rudest little bitch I have ever encountered in my life!! Meanwhile the other food I had order was cold and soggy no one ate the food said it was gross!! It's horrible that this blonde individual with glasses has a job treating people with so much disrespectful!! Tried to speak to a manager but there wasn't one on site at this time!! I heard this isn't the first time she has treated customers poorly!!"}
{"text":"Decent Wendy's, not the best but not the worst. customer service could have been better."}
{"text":"Decent spot for lunch or a grab-and-go spot. This place is for High School and College students."}
{"text":"I do like like there hamburgers they always are juicy and fresh. I think there a little expensive and a lot of times the  staff isn't the best, they are open late so that's Great and they do have the best fast food chili"}
{"text":"We frequent this Wendy's a lot because it is close to home and my pup likes the nuggets. Today we go and get two combo meals, 10 nuggets and a bacon-ator fry and we get to the window where a young kid is working (maybe 15/16 years old) we pay for the food, wait a few minutes and get our food as we are pulling away I tell my boyfriend to check and make sure it's what we ordered and I hear the kid at the window call me a \"dumb bitch\". So I immediately stop and back up and I tell the kid go get the manager he throws his hands up and says \"what?\" I said you know what go get the manager now. The manager, Chris, comes to the window and I let him know what happened and he said he would handle it of course. We get home and of course we are missing food we ordered. (The bacon-ator fries) so I call in and the manager says he will give us a comp combo next time we come in but I doubt we will be back to this establishment. I've never been so disrespected at a fast food restaurant for simply telling someone to check the order."}
{"text":"Although I am not a fan of fast food joints sometimes it's necessary.  When it comes to fast food, Wendy's is my all time favorite.  So it was on a recent marathon trip to SC.  I was staying next store to Wendy's so walked over for a quick bite for lunch.  It was about 1:30 pm on Sat so I wasn't expecting a large lunch crowd but there it was, a line of about 15 people.  No problem, I had time to wait.  And wait I did. For a very long time.  It seemed one of the 2 guys working the counter was working in slow motion while the other was trying to hustle & get meals out.  I have never been to a Wendy's this slow.   Eventually I got my salad & was on my way.  My mozz & chicken salad was good, however it came with some kind of mustard dressing on it.  I always get their salads & they give you a packet of dressing on the side; I wondered why they would put dressing on it as well.  Later in the day before hitting the road again we stopped for dinner.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich & my friend ordered a burger & fries.  Again, the wait was excruciating!  We waited half an hour for our order; not so fast fast food!  My sandwich came out on a grain roll that tasted like it was a week old.  The entire thing looked & tasted old.  My friend's fries had also obviously sitting around for quite some time.  He just dumped them.  Had we not been on the road when we started eating we would have returned the food.  It was that bad.  I DO NOT recommend this particular Wendy's & I sincerely think corporate should check & see what the problem is there.  I'm sure the only reason they are still in business is because of the theme park & hotel across the street."}
{"text":"I've been to this Wendy's maybe a few times since the 7 years I've lived around this area.  When I've been through drive thru recently a few times around 9:00pm the girl Ashley working the drive thru is the most nicest person there! I honestly think she shouldn't even be working there because of her uplifting personality, she is to good for Wendy's and they don't deserve her! She is always generous, funny and very kind!"}
{"text":"First, I want to preface this review by saying all I got were Frosty's. I can't give more than 3.5 stars since really there just isn't enough to review.  C wanted a 50 cent frosty. So we stopped by on our way home after dinner. Holy smoke the line at the drive-thru was 7 cars long. We opted to park and I went in. The dining room was clean, although a bit cold and not temperature wise, just a bit of a cold feeling with the design. But, that's not why I was there. The girl behind the counter was nice enough. She took my order and before I knew it, I was handed my Frosty's in a carrier. Back out to the car I went and as we looked down the line of cars in the drive-thru line, we noted that the car that was at the end when I parked, was still 4 back. Guess going inside was the right move. 50 cent frosty's. Nice employees. Quick service. Clean dining room. 3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Our host was Quiana and she had a great attitude while attending us and everyone that came in. Food was nice and hot. My salad was delicious as well"}
{"text":"Usually on point.. my entire order was jacked up multiple things missing and didnt get a receipt. Workers are nice though"}
{"text":"Drive thru order got messed up in every way possible. Asked for chocolate got vanilla, asked for Coke Zero got regular coke. Asked no cheese on chicken wrap, got cheese."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times over the past few years. This Wendy's is hands down the fastest I've ever seen. Just like fast food is supposed to be like."}
{"text":"Most horrible experience! Went around 9pm, the cashier in drive thru was rude, she would not let me get a word out without speaking over me. I specifically asked for my food fresh it was cold, went to give it back she copped an attitude and was not trying to take the food back, another worker got involved had me park for fresh food food still was not fresh, in fact I think it was the same food as before. Never will come to location ever again!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time the other day and I was pleasantly surprised. I came in with a big order to carry out. The cashier was super friendly and so helpful. I can't speak for any other employee but the cashier helped make my decisions so much easier. Customer service like this is the reason to come back. The food is the usual Wendy's food and a warm hot temperature."}
{"text":"Waited in line in the dining room for 40 minutes. After seeing the cheese curds between the managers fingers and the crud under the managers nails I asked how often their gloves were changed. Manager stated, \"we are required to change them every four hours.\" Food was cold by the time we got it all. Toasted bread was burnt. Sloppy grill grease lined the inside wrapper of our sandwiches. Old, wilted, clear, lettuce. Underripe tomatoes. It's shameful, and I would be embarassed to say I worked here. If I wasn't bringing food for our office, I would have gone somewhere else. Our office will never order from here again. Super disappointing. Would give zero stars but unable."}
{"text":"I like the look of the remodel, but they just took the same space and made it less functional while spending a whole lot of dough doing it. They should have hired someone to \"plan\" out a better restaurant instead of trying to look like the more \"upscale\" Mickey D's and failing miserably in the process.  The food has been growing ever more lackluster with every visit to the point where I will most likely never be back (well, maybe to see their next remodel in 20 years).  Nice to see portions have shrunken considerably while prices have risen equally. My small chili only filled 2/3 of the cup...WTF? I guess I'll waste my fast food dollars where I know I'm being ripped off and yet I still don't care... Helloooo McD's!"}
{"text":"I was starved and Wendy's was the only fast food that was quick and easy in between my flights. Unfortunately, the line was super long and they only had 1 register open. I had an hour to spare, so I was willing to wait for hot food.   Luckily, the line went quick. But, what I don't get is how there is only 1 cashier, 1 runner, and a ton of people working in the back kitchen. I was baffled...   The cashier told me the wrong number so I was waiting for my order while other people's orders behind me came and went. When I questioned my order and conveyed what number I was given, they claimed that they didn't even have that number in the system.   Perhaps I just made up a number of my own and wanted to wait for my food... Really?!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty good, the food was delivered pretty fast. Only problem the food was not warm, more on the cold side. My first time to a Wendy's in years I remember why I don't eat there!!"}
{"text":"Management can be rude at times, there is way too much screaming and foul language from staff in the evening, store isn't always clean, and sandwiches at the night pick up window are never right and never fresh."}
{"text":"The food they served us was cold. The only think that almost burned my mouth was the chicken nuggets. We asked them to remake the food. This time, the fries and nuggets were hit, but burgers still cold. Asked for a refund on one of the burgers and the lady wants to argue that it's fresh! Fresh doesn't mean heated to the proper temperature. There was maybe 5 people in the whole store, you can produce hot food. You can't get by solely based on the name Wendy's, you have to deliver as well. This location did not."}
{"text":"Was glad to see a 99 sanitation rating but that was about all they had going for them. Service was insanely slow. It's seemed as if staff weren't working really well together to serve just a few guests."}
{"text":"My experience at this Airport Wendy was excellent.  The line was not too long around noon today as the staff seem to be very quick in taking order.  I was on line for 5 mins and then got my food in another 5-10 mins.  The server was very courteous and gave me extra ketchup and other condiments.  The price for 2 combo meal and another sandwiches with Chili as the side was $22.  Pretty good price for airport.  Their prices was in the same ball park as regular Wendy.  The menu was trimmed down a little but overall it had most of the food that I enjoyed at the Wendy.  When I ate the food on the plane 20 mins later , it was still nice (not dry) and warm."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Rude tones, bad food and they didn't get my order right. I ordered 2 burgers and 2 chicken sandwiches, all I got was 4 burgers. Come on! Fast food is easy!"}
{"text":"I frequent this Wendy's a lot and generally there is never any issues. Today my husband whom is African American went into this establishment with his Sunday church clothes on to redeem and issue from another day that we were there. We spoke with Esmeralda on Thursday night and she said that were to get some free items because they were short staffed and some of our items were forgotten. Hey that's great thank you. So we go today July 19th 2015 and asked to speak to the manager as the manager approached my husband she begin to look very intimidated like she had never seen a black man in dress clothes. My husband begin to explain the situation she begin saying that it didn't sound like her and basically acting as if my husband was lying. The thing is how would he know the other managers name if they don't wear name tags? So she didn't honor what was given to us AT ALL so we ordered and asked for her name she told my husband that he didn't need her name. Little does she know there is more then one way to get that information. So GAIL or GAYLE however you spell it because you don't wear name tags please believe all this is now out in the open to show how you treat your customers and African Americans. By the way we also called that number on the bottom of the receipt and made another complaint regarding our disrespectful visit here at this Wendy's."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! None at all after waiting at the counter forever. Please fix"}
{"text":"Been to this location more than a handful of times. But we're not here to talk about my severe obesity. Let's get down to business.   Service is always friendly enough. Not overachievers and not rude.  Food is consistently good.  Don't have any memory of them messing up the food.  Cleanliness is ok. This is a 3 star Wendy's."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Three times burned.  I should have learned after the first two.  The first time I went through this drive thru I was served by a rather crass older lady who greeted me through the speaker with an ever so eloquent \"take yo order\".  I brushed it off thinking it was no big deal.  Until I pull up to the window, and see an older Caucasian gal with dirty hair, that looked as if she hadn't had a shower in a few days.  Greasy haired and snaggly teeth.  Exactly what you want to see before satisfying the craving for Jr Bacons.  The only words out of her mouth, now I can't make this stuff up, is \"Eight Fiddy\".  I hand her a 20, and when she hands me back my change I see the worst hands I have ever seen in my entire life.  Just down right nasty.  Second time was much the same including the greeting, and \"Eight Fiddy\" at the window, only this time her hands are even worse.  It almost looked as though some kind of flesh eating virus has taken over and was waging a war that it was obviously winning.  I learned my lesson from last time and had exact change ready as to avoid any contamination coming from her hands into my pockets.  But I can't help and notice a dirty bandage on one of her fingers in a feeble attempt to conceal the horror that was unfolding upon her hands.  This is complimenting her stench and even more gross hair.  EWWW Lucky for me the cook handed me the food thru the window.  So third time...  I couldn't even eat it.  I did a drive by the window to make sure she wasn't working it.  Success a nice larger gentleman was working the window.  I pull around after ordering my food, and much to my delight he was very nice, and prompt.  Only when he hands me back my change his hands were all jacked up too.  And to top it all off, he had what appeared to be open wounds on his second knuckle on two fingers.  I apprehensively take the change.  Not wanting to contaminate the vehicle again.  I put the change in on the center counsel not wanting to even think about it.  The food comes out, and WAM another gross shot confirming the hideousness of this poor man's hands.  I take the food, pull out on the street, and throw it out the window at about 55 miles an hour going down Cheyenne.  That 11.50 is glaring at me on the center counsel.  I know it has aids.  No way was I going to put that back in my pocket, and contaminate the rest of my items stowed safely away in there.  I'm cheap, I mean like cheap cheap.  Hence the 1.99 Jr Bacons...  I speed up, grab the money with a napkin from the center counsel, and out the window it goes."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a Wendy's. The food is pretty predictable, but they are consistently predictable. No mistakes, no disgusting surprises. This review mainly is for the service. This store handles a lunch rush like it's nobodies business! I can be behind six cars and somehow the line always flies smoothly!! There's no lunch rush anxiety here! The male taking orders was above and beyond kind. I adore the two women who run the drive through windows. They are the sweetest human beings! Always have such nice conversation and are very considerate! This is perhaps Wendy's Utopia! Seriously tho, keep up the great service!"}
{"text":"I'm eating what could be a baked potato, but it may be a slab of leather...I'm not quite sure.    My BLT salad was supposed to be grilled chicken with a balsamic vinaigrette, but it's Italian dressing with fried chicken...hmm  at least the girl upfront was nice..."}
{"text":"This place claims it is open until 2am but it never is.  3 times in the last month I've tried to go here later on at night and they haven't been open one time. Last night I went here at 11pm, when they were supposed to be open until 2am according to the hours on their building and online, and still they were closed. Anyway if I wanted to go somewhere to get food during the day I'd never go here and apparently at night when other things aren't open I still can't go here because they close hours before they claim they close. It's also a violation of trust they do this too. Anyway from now on if I want to go to Wendy's I will just have to drive a few miles to go to the next closest one because this one does not have its stuff together."}
{"text":"This place has consistently bad food, the service is sloppy and seems like they dont care at all. Its been this way for years and I only eat here once a year. Everytime its a huge disappointment and waist of money."}
{"text":"I can only rate the drive-thru here, as I have never been inside. I'm always skeptical about the long line that tends to form at the drive-thru, no matter what time of day I go. But the line always moves quickly. The staff here is on top of their game for sure.   The junior cheeseburger is one of my favorite things on earth. Less than 300 calories and just enough to keep me going, without slowing me down."}
{"text":"I went to this Wendy's due to the way the building looks!  I was told that the city (Independence) wanted the fast food restaurants to look that way!  The food was still the same, but in a nicer atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Not really much to say other than the convenience of a Wendy's in the airport which is nice if you are in the mood for a burger and a Frosty. The only problem was airport prices! The cheapest combo if I remember correctly was $8. I got a chicken sandwich combo and a small frosty and my bill was $13. Really sad! I just don't understand the need to gouge the consumer for convenience."}
{"text":"Fast food is fast food, but unfortunately every time I have come to this Wendy's location I have been extremely disappointed with the staff. On a recent drive thru visit, the individual who took my order was basically having a conversation with another employee while I was placing my order, which in turn probably caused the fact that my order was wrong.  And, second, they are very short and can be somewhat rude at times. Even though the service is poor and my orders haven't been right every time, I will say I do love their burgers. I always order the cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles only, add extra pickles. This way I know it is made fresh to my order and is always good. The fries are hit or miss. If made fresh they are great, but honestly you can tell when they have been sitting around for a while.  I do like that this location is close to where I live, but know there are better places for a quick burger and fries that aren't hit or miss."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've been up this early for breakfast!  The food was good and the drive-thru service was fast and friendly . . . too bad they won't be serving breakfast after Oct. 20, 2013 at this location."}
{"text":"This happened a few months ago and I'm finally getting around to writing about how this was the worst experience I have ever had at any drive thru in my entire life just over a lemonade!  I ordered two signature strawberry lemonades and they gave me a regular and a strawberry. So I asked if I could please switch it for a strawberry. The manager came over and said that will cost a little more money since the strawberry costs more. So I'm like oh thats fine, I'm sorry for the misunderstanding.    But then he got an attitude with me and sounded so mean and was like \"I'll give you it for the cheaper price since you already paid, but don't think you can do this next time you come here and think you can get your lemonade for a cheaper price, next time you'll have to pay full price!\"  He was acting like I was trying to sneak a way to get a cheaper drink but that was never what I tried to do! I was fine with paying the extra few cents! I even kept apologizing. The cashier was nice, but the manager was just so rude about the situation and acting like I was such a horrible person. I almost cried. Then when he did give me the strawberry lemonade I think it was the same lemonade he originally gave me he just squirted strawberry sauce on top and it wasn't even mixed up."}
{"text":"I was passing by on a weekday morning and I noticed a sign advertising breakfast. Wait, I thought to myself, breakfast at a Wendy's? Intrigued, I stepped inside and checked out their offerings. It's mostly the usual fare of sandwiches and platters, but they also had a breakfast burrito (consisting of egg, sausage, and cheese), so I had to sample that.  It's terrible. Worse yet, it's lazy. It's the three aforementioned ingredients, prepared without even a touch of seasoning, rolled into a generic white tortilla. The eggs are bland and the sausage is almost comically tasteless. Was the burrito then put into a press to give it some texture? Of course not! This monstrosity is the burrito equivalent of baby food.  I can only hope that the joint's regular menu fares better than this, because I was just about flabbergasted by its mediocrity."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is okay if you don't have time to look for another one. The service is average and they almost always seem to have only one available cashier to help the large lunch crowd. My kudos to that poor woman. But the management gets a thumbs down for not assigning enough people.  Also it seems like all the weirdos in Phoenix come in to order.   Don't go to this Wendy's unless you are willing to wait in line for a long time while some weirdo is glancing at you every thirty seconds."}
{"text":"Just witnessed a manager openly belittle a staff member while I was waiting for my food. Totally inapropriate to do in front of customers. Restaurant was clean, staff friendly. Manager needs retraining."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Has been for years, no wonder the dining room is always empty. I work and live close by and was willing to give it another shot. I was waiting for 6 or seven minutes and no one waited on me. An employee walked from behind the counter  and stood at the other register, another employee came out and took her order before mine. This is not acceptable, employee or not, it would have been common courtesy to say \"he was here first\", but the ignorant bitch just proceeded to give her order.  I walked out.Never again. Get these monkeys out of there."}
{"text":"I just had an awesome experience with Anthony! He was super personable and easy going. Couldn't help but mention it! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Went to this location on 06/25/17 and let me tell you, HORRIBLE SERVICE! Immediately when I pulled up to the drive thru we were rudely greeted by the employee and rushed. Every time I went to speak all I kept being asked was ANYTHING ELSE, ANYTHING ELSE??I mean come on! That is ridiculous. I couldn't even get a word out with this woman! As we pulled up to the window, she was rolling her eyes and extremely rude to one of her employees who wanted to clock out of his shift. Also, half of our order was missing, so we decided were never coming back to this place. Worst fast food service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Pulled into the drive through Tuesday around 4pm. I had just left work and I normally don't go straight for fast food but I'm pregnant and was really hungry. There was a line but it moved fast. I ordered an Asiago Chicken combo, and the girl in the drive through asked me a question that sounded like \"Homsnfkhdefhsdohifv?\". I asked her to repeat and she proceeded to ask the question in over the top slow motion, super slow and sarcastic. I tried to finish my order, but she just kept talking in that extremely S-L-O-W tone. I ended up driving away because I was certain she was going to either spit in my food or worse. Horrible. I've worked in food service for 16 years and I know it gets frustrating, but this was completely uncalled for."}
{"text":"I just happened to go to the Shell gas station and my son said he wanted wendy's to eat. Now we dont normally eat out often but today I said ok. We got the gas, walked in wendys and instantly I saw how filthy the restaurant was. Then I walked in further towards the cash register and there was this aweful smell. We automatically turned around and walked out the restaurant. My first time there and this was an aweful experience and I will not eat there again. They need to work on keeping the place sanitary especially being a good place...."}
{"text":"It's a Wendy's. The reason I gave two stars was the cashier or \"service\" I received.  Maybe I happened to come on an \"off\" day but nonetheless, I step to order after she says \"next\" and she stares at me with no hello or smile or expression in her face.  Moral of the story? I'd rather go to a vending machine where I'd get a friendlier transaction."}
{"text":"Do you want to waste half an hour of your life trying to get your order right?  If so, you're coming to the right place!  Please make sure to stop by and have the overweight, black manager yell at you and accuse you of being rude when you refuse to pay extra for an item you ordered!!"}
{"text":"No wonder why they have 2 stars average; the customer service here is the worst!  The manager Heather is rude, abrasive and threatening.  Unfortunately, my family will not eat at this chain again.  Wendy's should really hold their staff by a higher standard; maybe then their stores will get more business.  I see this as a diminishing brand and by the looks of the reviews I am not the only one who feels this way."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this will be our last visit to this location. We have been going for years but it is going down hill now. Signs on front door and inside resturant wanting help with a smile.        First off the place was very cold and the food cooled off fast. It took several minutes to be waited on with no one behind me. Young girl finally took our order No Smile ever. The management needs to pay more attention to customers requests. My wife kept asking if the air could be turned down but was ignored. We eat fast and got out. Not the usual Wendy's."}
{"text":"We went to two Wendy's here in Mesa, Az. The first was on Main St. They didn't know how to make a Rootbeer Float so we left to go to the Wendy's on Hampton by Walmart. I asked for baked potatoe and small chili and a Rootbeer float. No problem.      Now for the problem. Service was so,so but the chili beans in the soup were hard as rocks and the girl thought they were out of baked potatoes. Baked potatoes seem to be a problem at Wendy's. This is not the first time they had no baked potatoes. It will be a while before we go back to either store."}
{"text":"They should really consider selling this store to someone who's going to make it better. I've been sitting in the drive thru for 15mins because the dining room is closed. WTH this store is sad."}
{"text":"Restrooms are always filthy!!! The music inside is too loud. Drive thru is so slow. Always forgetting my condiments."}
{"text":"It's an airport Wendy's!  That said, service was friendly and fairly fast, although there was only one customer ahead of me.  Fries were fresh and crisp, so I give them that.  My spicy chicken sandwich was freshly made and it was made with care.  Sometimes you get one and it's got way too much mayo and the chicken is off-center on the bun so you have to reassemble it to eat it, but this one looked and tasted good.  The combo meal was under $9 so I can't complain about the price either (although I'm comparing that to NYC prices so many places seem cheaper by comparison)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Pretzel bacon cheeseburger combo. There was only one person in line so I was able to place my order quickly and the person that took my order was friendly and answered my questions cheerfully. I went to where you pick up the food and was dismayed when almost as soon as I got there my sandwich was done, not fresh made apparently. The server was no where to be found. I tried to get someones attention but they were busy talking among themselves. After a while the girl who puts the sandwiches together comes around the partition and gives it to me.I thank her.I will say that the fries were great as I ate most of them while I stood and waited for my hamburger. I got to the table and the sandwich looked great. I took one bite and this pink sauce started to squish out, it was actually dripping out the other side of my sandwich with every bite. The sauce is really good and there was so much on the burger to cover the fact that it was so dry, the meat was dry, the bun was dry and something tasted slightly burnt.After a couple of bites I had had enough. I have never had this bad of a burger in Wendy's before. I was there at 2pm and I guess I got the leftovers from the lunch rush. If they are selling leftover food I'm not sure of there food safety. I was so glad to see this place go up because the old store was one of my regular stops when shopping McKnight Rd."}
{"text":"Asked for a crispy blt and I didn't get it I was missing my bacon and cheese , and I specifically asked for it and didn't receive it at all ."}
{"text":"Disgrace, the burger taste just as it looks! No tomato, no lettuce, nothing I hardly tasted the mushrooms and cheese and the onion rings are over saggy! If I had time I would go get my money back this burger is just inappropriate!"}
{"text":"Nasty !!!!! I'll absolutely call headquarters on Mondaye  It is one thing to serve dead cold dry food from two hours ago but arguing that it is barely from half an hour ago!! Who wants to buy fries from half an hour ago that turn to powder in your mouth ???? Shame"}
{"text":"Ehhhh, yeah it was Wendy's and my expectations were low, but come on. Y'all couldda been better with a few tweaks.   First, if there's a long line at the register, open another station. Whoa. Didn't see that coming.   Second, serve me a warm sammy. Don't care if it's warm for the first or fifth time. Warm is good. Always.   Third, when I ask for extra sauce, no need to shake your head and hesitate. I'm just out for your tasty sauces. They're great. And I would like more than less of then. Thanks.   In summary, consider another spot to fill your belly."}
{"text":"I can't say anything for the food because we never ordered.    We arrived at 7:40, stood in line until 7:48. We finally get up to the counter to order and the lady working says \"hold on one second I'll be right back\". We stood there again for ten more minutes. While we stood there I watched her help the other workers. She touched food with her dirty hands she touched money with. She never washed her hands between accepting money from the woman who was in front of me and handling food.  While we stood there and continued to wait she never came back so at 8:00 we left.   This was awful.  I'm actually going to call the Wendy's today when they open."}
{"text":"I was there on Nov.21 at 7:30pm to get a late take out dinner. I stood at the counter for 9 minutes waiting for someone to at least take my order! It took them another 10 minutes for them to get my order together! The restaurant was not busy, there were employees standing around doing NOTHING! I did not get to complain verbaly to them as I was ignored other than when they took my order and gave me my food. Worst Wendy's experience ever!"}
{"text":"For the original frosty, there is just no other competition. Nothing beats that late night craving like a sweet, cold, chocolate frosty with a side of salty fries. Love it. Tastes like childhood :)"}
{"text":"Strange odor inside restaurant. Cockroach seen climbing up the wall. I would give a zero if I could."}
{"text":"Very slow. More worried about Labor costs than good customer service. Too many options to put up with this."}
{"text":"I tried them again today, just to give them a second chance....Fail! This time, they not only threw the burgers together (just one burger half across the other) with hardly any condiments and one tiny onion...But they conveniently forgot our fries? Just burned/dried out burgers. Sorry, but go to E. Market St., they got their people together!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest fast food drive thru I have ever seen.  I live close by and I love Wendy's.  However, I usually go to other fast food places because of the wait.  The wait times are worse after 6pm."}
{"text":"We waited in a line of about 25 people for 15 minutes and it didn't move. There was only 1 cashier and he was also in charge if getting people their food. There was no apology or anything for the slow moving line and they messed up two peoples orders while we were waiting. Don't eat here. There is a great Carl's Jr. down the street."}
{"text":"Though Wendy's isn't my go-to fast food spot, I always enjoy ordering from there.   I almost never change my order there, haha. I always get a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger, value cut fries, 4 piece crispy chicken nuggets (with BBQ sauce), and a chocolate frosty. This meal is so cheap, it's crazy, but it really hits the spot. I personally like their chicken nuggets better than McDonald's.  Recently I started ordering the strawberry lemonade, which is quite tasty!  I noticed they now offer a caramel frosty? I haven't tried it yet, but it sounds delish! I may have to try it next time I visit.  Oh, I also noticed that this location is open very late now! I can't remember the exact times, but I believe they are open until at least 1 am everyday. I think the latest they stay open is until 2 am! Yaaaay!"}
{"text":"Ordered two medium frostys, got two small. And I rarely ever eat burgers, I was hungry for one, and probably won't be ever hungry again for one. Awful location."}
{"text":"Typical fast food joint,  burgers were well prepared and not salted to death like other Wendy's. Not much to say here, fast burgers for fast moving people."}
{"text":"I usually don't post negative reviews. Nine times out of ten I'd rather not waste my time and energy than write a bad review. With that said, my experience at this Wendy's warrants my time and energy.   From the moment I walked in I felt like I was in an empty high school cafeteria being run by its freshmen class. The sounds coming from their kitchen was reminiscent of locker room banter.  Finally my chief complaint. My double cheeseburger was not cooked. My first bite, I sunk my teeth in two seared patties that were both frozen on the inside!    I ended up throwing the new burger away that they gave me because I lost my appetite and because refunds weren't an option.  I DO NOT CARE IF THIS IS THE LAST PLACE TO EAT ON EARTH, I WOULD NOT AND WILL NOT COME BACK HERE EVER PERIOD."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of getting in the drive-thru. Worst experience ever. They don't care how long you wait. Seven cars pulled up in front and six behind me. Thirty minute wait. Never again."}
{"text":"Ashley:) the chick that works there is totally awesome!  She was so kind compared TO THE REST OF THR CROWD in the airport. I've gave her a compliment for being so helpful! And polite and patient with the evening we were having. Thanks Ashley!   -strangers of SV Idaho-"}
{"text":"Just what you would expect from an airport fast food establishment. Mediocre/bad service, horrendously expensive prices ($3.00 for a burrito smaller than a small cell phone, or $2.62 for a small soda?) The food was alright, maybe it tasted better, I tried to savor each of the three bites that burrito took to consume, realizing each bite was $1.00."}
{"text":"Food was same as every other Wendy's, so these 5 stars are for the employees.  I'm tired from my Vegas trip and it was so nice to see the smiles and laughter.  The guy with the purple ponytail had a great attitude, joking and kidding while being attentive to customers. Another lady was dancing.  Not what I've encountered at a fast food place at the airport, so I wanted to leave a review so hopefully. The manager gives them the kudos they deserve."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Rude employees and my food is never correct! Ordered a Jr chz burger Felix today got a fucking hamburger! Get ur shit together Wendy's!"}
{"text":"I came here because Wendy's has always been my FAVORITE fast food. I ordered a #6 lettuce only with fries and a coke.... I never received my Coke and my fries were cold and not even full. So I paid for a medium combo yet got a small fry and sandwich with NO drink!! Awful service at the Wendy's I will drive the extra couple miles to the next Wendy's from here on.."}
{"text":"This Wendys isnt closed .. just got the chicken apple pecan salad here .. good fast service .. salad was great!"}
{"text":"First time that I got disappointed eating at Wendy's. I thought that I would get a Dave's Double at this location since I missed eating their juicy burgers. I asked for it fresh since, ya know.. Vegas strip is busy as heck and they probably have a lot of old food that is on standby for a rush. The burger that I received and consumed was very comparable to trash. The patty was dry as hell and very disappointing.   Only thing that could save this location is how friendly their staff."}
{"text":"This is usually my go-to Wendy's location. I come here so often I use the survey coupon to get a free burger with the purchase of a sandwhich, so I usually get the Dave's double combo and get my sandwhich for free. I really like the food here as it's better than McDonald's and Burger King but lately they won't let me use the receipt to get it. I usually come here with a friend and get our fries well done but if they aren't willing to do this then they're just going to lose customers and their customer satisfaction will keep getting worse day by day. I'm disappointed in the manager Kristin as she usually is the one there whenever we order food, and so I know she's familiar with our order and what we like to eat. This isn't the first occasion this happened and I know it's not going to be the last. In the future I'd suggest sticking to the Warden Eglinton location or the Victoria Park and Sheppard location as they're much more reliable."}
{"text":"They recently remodeled this wendys to look more modern/new....we thought it would be a lot like the Wendys at 7th street and greenway... we were fooled!  However, the outside looks great. Inside is some of the worst remodel work I have ever seen. Layout looks different, but the tile and everything else looks like it was thrown together without care.  It doesn't smell that great either. Don't let the outside fool you... it is is not great inside.  Food.... the service isnt great.  They were not that attentive .... until there were a couple of people behind us. She  recommended the The Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger. .... which the last time I had it, I would not even recommend paying for it. If I had seen it prior to paying for it, I would have refused paying for it. It was the size of a dollar cheeseburger. It was horrible for the cost. I don't recommend it.    They do NOT listen when taking orders. We asked for 2 orders of french fries and only received one... had to pay for a second one as she completely forgot to include a second fry on our order. The crispy chicken sandwich, the cod fish sandwich were completely bland.. and their usually delicious fries were actually bland and tasted old.   That was yesterday. We used to go to this wendy's often..not anymore."}
{"text":"I hate that I have to give this 1 star when this Wendy's deserves 0. Incompetent and uncaring staff. 20 minute wait for drive-thru for only three cars. 30 minute wait inside for only a handful of guests. A majority of the orders were sent out incorrectly. The fries were old and cold. Keep driving!"}
{"text":"The Wendy's at Stonecrest-I was absolutely ill with them on 7-24-17 but against better judgement decided to give them another chance two weeks ago.  What a mistake.  Ordered 8 Double Stacks and 1 Smoky Mushroom Bacon Cheeseburger.  The food is always delicious but the service, once again, will make you mad as hell.  Got home and the Smoky Mushroom burger was left off the order. The Manager was very apologetic and gave us a free Cod Fillet Sandwich for having to come back.  Everyone was satisfied with the correction so we were not ready to give up on them.  Then 2 weeks went by and we decided to order again because the Double Stacks were still $1.00 each.  Here is the order and what we got. Ordered 4 DS with extra pickle and 4 DS with no ketchup or pickle but extra onions.  What we received was 6 DS with extra pickle and 2 with extra onions. It is always correct on the ordering screen but the dolts they hire can't get it right.  I give up, I give up, I give up.  The Stone crest store was the best up until about 2 years ago.  Their Management obviously is impaired as well as the staff.  Good fast food but expect the WRONG ORDER."}
{"text":"20 min for a panini melt with sausage?! only to find a hole in it?!  And to have it replaced with the wrong sandwich? I dont think so.  Great people with good intent, Lousy service!"}
{"text":"If you're planning on using the drive-thru, be sure to check your order before you leave. It's almost a guarantee that they'll forget to put something in there. It's annoying. Screw up once out of maybe 10 or 20 times, you're human. Screw up my order five times in a row, you obviously don't give a rodent's derriere about your job. I would think neither does your manager about his. I eventually stopped going to this place and went to the remodeled one on 75th and Encanto.   They're \"open 24 hours\" but may as well be closed. I went there for a burger and baked potato around 2 a.m. and first asked for the baked potato. \"We stop serving those and chili after 10.\"  \"Can I get a Baconator - Single?\" \"We stop serving meat after 1.\" \"Then, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?\" \"We have chicken...um....\" \"Never mind, then.\"  ***Drives off in an late night, unending hunt for food***"}
{"text":"This location used to be an absolute hole.  They recently renovated both the interior and the exterior, and now it's a very pleasant, good-looking store.  However, it's still Wendy's food.  And that's only okay."}
{"text":"I like the seating by the mock fireplace, fresh flowers on the tables were cute. Andre and the team seem to be short staffed tonight  but they're cranking out good food for a quick stop. Sadly, this meant the restrooms weren't attended too."}
{"text":"Okay, so where do I start..  so it's currently 9:50pm on Saturday February 3rd, 2018. The weather is horrible outside, but I was craving fries and a frosty. So I go out, to grab my frosty and fries. Ladeedah.. driving on my way home in this horrible weather excited to enjoy my frosty and fries while watching bridesmaids and marking some tests. A great Saturday night! I took a bite of the fries.. okay.. so they were DRY AND STALE AS HELL and like NO SALT. How long were these fries out for?! Disgusting. So here I am, frying my own fries while enjoying some of my frosty.  Thanks Wendy's for ruining my Saturday night with your stale fries. At least the frosty was good.  (I'm being over dramatic, but you get it.)"}
{"text":"Not terribly far from the Interstate, this drive-through Wendy's fit the bill for a late night snack. I'm a fan of the value meal. A couple of burgers and a Frosty and for well less than $5, I'm stuffed. Since they're smaller sized, they are much easier to eat and drive than a full-size Single or the awesome Baconator.  On the night I stopped in, service was very slow. It shouldn't take five minutes to go from placing your order to handing over your money. I don't know what was going on, but it was a long wait."}
{"text":"I was pleased to read that Wendy's had surpassed Burger King and takes the number two spot in the fast food standings. I think Dave Thomas has better burgers and much better not-burgers, including the salads and baked potatoes and the chili. Nothing beats the original chocolate Frosty!  I popped in for a quite bite this weekend and found this Wendy's to be solid. Standard layout and the standard menu. My Junior Bacon Cheeseburger was perfectly put together and the Cheesy Cheddarburger hit the spot. With a small chili and a small Frosty, I was stuffed and all for less than $5. That's a deal!"}
{"text":"Good for late night eats, leaving the airport after nearly everything there was closed. When you've been on two planes with a short layover and no time to actually eat anything, there's always Wendy's. My order was quick and when I got home, it was accurate. It was the epitome of A-OK."}
{"text":"A very convenient Wendy's but it's so well hidden by trees from the road that you might not notice it driving past. Its proximity to the Interstate is excellent and I think Wendy's is a better choice for burgers compared to the nearby Jack and Sonic outlets.  As Jeff mentions, you do have to check your order carefully. I've only had one problem with this Wendy's (they forgot the fries) but I caught it before I drove away and they fixed it.  Excellent burger with the toppings you want. Made to order. Good fries."}
{"text":"Not much in this terminal with Delta Airlines. My options were a spendy and slow-looking sit-down restaurant, a Starbucks or Wendy's. I chose Wendy's.  Single cheeseburger was fine and the fries were A-OK.  And hey, please don't eat fries on an airplane. They seriously stink up the nearest ten rows. Do everyone a favor and eat them before you get on board!"}
{"text":"Brand-new Wendy's that still smells a little of wet paint. That will go away but the great burger will stay. I popped in for a quick bite, two Junior Cheeseburgers Deluxe. They were assembled properly and had the right toppings in the right quantities.  As a new place, the restaurant is still quite clean and tidy. I hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"The drive through window had a long queue so I headed inside and got my snack for the road. Quickly prepared and as ordered, I was on my way before the last car in the drive through had made it to the window. #winning  The restaurant was tidy and the condiments station was appropriately stocked.  It's quick and convenient and easy to access."}
{"text":"Located in the A concourse between gates A5 and A7, this Wendy's has the usual menu of burgers and salads and even baked potatoes! Service is super snappy and efficient. Small seating area nearby and of course, you're welcome to bring your burger with you on the plane.  My recommendation? A double with cheese and no pickles. And if you really want to be the highlight of someone's flight, get some extra onions up in that!"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot in my heart (and probably some hardened arteries) for Dave Thomas and his Wendy's chain. My mind remembers the \"Where's the Beef\" commercials of the 80's and so even now when I'm thinking of a fast food meal, all things being equal, it will be Wendy's over any one else. The value meal is such a great deal and I think that their toppings are so much fresher than the Mc or the King.  So I popped in to here for a bag of goodies to bring back to the hotel. Ooooo, they have that poutine stuff I keep hearing about. I'll have one of those. Fries, cheese and gravy. What's not to love? And a pair of junior cheeseburger deluxes as backup. And of course, a FROSTY for dessert!  Everything was just as good as any other Wendy's I've been to. The poutine probably could have been better, but hey, my Grandma's not Canadian so it's not like she's gonna make one for me."}
{"text":"Always Fresh & Hot! Tender, & Juicy Chicken Nuggets, Salty Fries, A Tasty Frosty!! The Chicken Nuggets are to die for! LOLZERZ! Noothing Beats A Frosty On A Very Hot Day!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Wendy's I've ever been to. Consistently takes 20+ minutes in the drive through. Don't know if it's understaffed or what but every time I come here I regret it because you end up stuck in line.   The amount of business they lose from drive offs must be staggering. I don't know if the franchise owner just doesn't care or what but this place is a freaking disaster. There isn't another Wendy's for several miles so maybe they just don't care. Either way it's absurd."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this location a negative review. It is the most disgusting Wendy's location I've ever been to. Not a clean table in sight. The food was cold below regulations. The bathrooms had layers of toilet paper with feces on them all over the floors. Clearly never cleaned. If you're considering going in, do your health a favor and keep driving."}
{"text":"Wendy's is a chain where your meal expectations are formed before arrival.  The service you get, however, is hit or miss. This location is hit or miss. Perhaps it depends on the day of the week. The food may or may not be hot. They may or may not have dressing for the salad. They may or may not have chicken cooked to go on the salad.  You may or may not want to wait for service on any given day."}
{"text":"This is a pretty busy Wendy's location, especially via drive through.  For once I opted to get out of the vehicle with the kids.  The restaurant is nice and clean with a decent rating.  Service was friendly and the cashier did a good job of catering to the kids.  The Original Chocolate Frosty is always a sure bet!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible  When we got our french fries not only where the cold and stale but when we asked for some hot ones the manager gave us stink attitude. And  they charge way more because it's in an airport. Horrible service"}
{"text":"I have had a love/ hate relationship with this Wendy's location for years. At last you got it right and the bad smell is a thing of the past. Thanks to Jean Dilly. It's so clean in here!!!! It actually is smelling great in here. I can't believe it!!!! Thank you Jean!!"}
{"text":"This place brings down the whole franchise on a dawily bases, things have changed with the whole wCO. I have eaten at Wendy's all over and all I can see is that things have gotten worse over the past couple years.   I wouldn't give this place 1 star. I w"}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's in America. Horrible service every time. Only in an absolute pinch do i ever even bother stopping at this location."}
{"text":"The food here is just great on a budget! I come here at least once a week after my shift at my job ends in the night time. When I go to this location at night it's full of excitement a fun-filled employees. This is what I love about this Wendy's. The only thing I really dislike is how many times they mess up my order of a doublestack plain with no cheese on it (Allergic to cheese) but I have had no problem returning my food for a re-do. Most of the time I never get a receipt which makes it harder to give an employee proof, one night I didn't have a receipt and I was just really upset but not to the point where I was yelling. One of the employees re-did my hamburger and gave me a new steaming hot value sized fries! I just love this Wendy's. I will always come back."}
{"text":"As bluntly as possible... Fuck these mother f'in a'holes I live down the street and constantly visit. I've finally had it with their lack of customer service.  FINE!  They close before midnight on a Friday! However, the gross cold burgers and fries is what makes me write this horrible review!!!  Most of the employees are drugged out.  Pros: you get a free meal Cons: they ask for money while they are holding YOUR money in their hand!!!!  Bottom line: I love Wendy's!!! Juuust, NOT   THIS  ONE!  Ps: months later update 06/04/17 Still SUCK!!! I wish they would clean the house and get NEW employees. I'm tired of saying NO pickles and having to pick them off"}
{"text":"Was only car in drive thru - they pulled me forward. Waited for 10 min for my food. Went inside and there was NOBODY inside and NO cars in drive thru. Staff was joking and messing around. Complained to manager who admitted they forgot about my order and was given no compensation and nothing to make it right. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"I hate giving one stars but this location in general gave me a really bad time. I had opened crackers when I ordered my chili. My bag looked like a hot mess. Got additional charges for my two drinks which is odd. And the pace was slow for a dead night. I usually go to the Wendy's location at Stephanie and Wigwam off of the 215 but this one was closer to my friends. Really disappointed at how they run their business here :("}
{"text":"Been here two times. Every time they manage to screw the very simple orders up. Have never been to a fast food chain restaurant with such a bad performance!"}
{"text":"I ordered my food before 10 other people, including a post mates delivery that ordered 10 different foods; I got my food 40 minutes later after being told to wait multiple times."}
{"text":"The amount of time it takes from the time you pull up to the drive thru for the person to say hello and take your order is ridiculous. When the woman finally addressed me she says \"yeah what do you want?\" Only even at Wendy's is because Chick-fil-A is closed. For such a prime location next to the target you would think customer service would be a little better."}
{"text":"Slow. Customer service is okaaaay. Food is hot. Burger wasn't fresh  I ordered the $4 meal double stack. Burger must have been sitting there for a little while. Fries n nuggets were fresh tho"}
{"text":"So this location is kinda old and the service is slow but the food comes out as it's supposed to at Wendy's...unless of course they screw up your order which is quite often."}
{"text":"I went to Wendy's today and placed an order for a Baconator, crispy bacon, no ketchup, protein style wrapped in lettuce instead of the bun.  Paid for my order and was told to pull up for my order.  I looked at my receipt and they charged me for an extra item I didn't order - a BLT crispy chicken.  I went back inside and the guy who I paid came up and said he thought I order the BLT crispy chicken sandwich in addition to my baconator and side caesar.  I said I didn't.  He refunded me for the chicken sandwich with no remorse.  I got my order and was about to leave when I thought I should check my order again.  In a small container there were two patties thrown in with the bacon and a dollup of mayonaise.  No lettuce wrap.  I turned around went back into the restaurant again and specifically asked for a manager and only wanted the manager.  The manager sent a kid up named Sean.  He was very nice and just stuck in the middle.  I explained to him what I wanted.  They supposedly remade the order for the baconator.  It came back with a small piece of lettuce at the bottom of the tray - not lettuce wrapped protein style.  WTF is wrong with people????  The staff was beyond incompetent."}
{"text":"Went last night 4-15-15 around 6PM for dinner from the drive-thru.  I was so impressed I wanted to write a review.  My food was ready as soon as I pulled up to the window and the lady who took my order was nice.   I had:   -Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger ($2.21)Delicious!  Veggies were cold and crispy, meat was hot, buns were soft.    -Sour Cream & Chive Baked Potato ($1.76) Perfect.  Huge, fluffy, came with butter and sour cream.  I had them add bacon and cheese...not sure how much extra that added to it but my total was $7.42 with tax so I'm guessing not much.   -Caesar Side Salad ($1.65) My favorite! Comes with lemon caesar dressing on the side and a pack of croutons on the side.  Has three big juicy cherry tomatoes on it."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's.  But.....   This one is awful.   It's Saturday night and this place is empty.  Every one of my orders had some part messed up.  the drink was wrong, the frys were raw, they were out of ketchup.  I can't go back.  This is at least the third visit with the same problems"}
{"text":"It's Wendy's.  This is an above average location.   Nice newer interior.  They have the coke freestyle machine.   It was a little slow but food was good and place is clean.   If you are lucky you can look out the window and see some cool cars at Barrett-Jackson show room."}
{"text":"Went here to get Frosty's for my kids. I only needed 3 of them. The restaurant was nearly empty and yet the supervisor told the employee who was taking the orders to stop so they could catch up. Honestly, there were only 4 tables with customers inside and they couldn't keep up? I ordered the Frosty's which was painful because the employee was new and kept entering the order wrong and needed the manager to void the order (2 medium and 1 small Frosty). Very tough order. When we finally got the Frosty's, they did not have lids on them and were very watery with soupy consistency. My kids and I were not impressed.  This place needs better management, better trained staff and needs to get organized. If they're this inept when the restaurant is slow, I can only imagine the trainwreck when they're busy. My kids and I will not be returning to this location. The location on Marks is much better!"}
{"text":"I've always gotten good service at this particular location. The food has always been good and decent and the service is always been exceptionally friendly and polite. I think they should be proud of the way they treat their customers."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is my joint yo. In my book, Wendy's offers the best franchise burgers out there - you can really taste the difference. You can't leave without taking at least a small Frosty just $2."}
{"text":"This very quiet resturant has some somewhat rude customer service, but the food is fresh and the vibe here is more local than some of the flashier places as you get closer to the Strip or even Downtown.  I ordered  a 10-piece nugget meal with a Dr Pepper. I was able to get refills just by asking, which is always a plus. The dining room was mostly empty save for a group of women and a small family. It was nice and peaceful for eating. The fries were actually really good; I didn't know the recipe changed again.  I'd come here again if I was the DD for an exhausted and hungry drunkard looking for a chili baked potato!"}
{"text":"It's Wendy's, right? How can you screw it up?  Belittle and demean your employees in front of customers and mess up order after order, barely apologizing to each person as you correct it. I imagine it IS difficult working at a fast food restaurant but this is a popular location and today's crowd was about 1/10th as thick as what I imagine the average summer turnout to be. Someone needs to shape up.  I don't want to hear a duty manager say things like \"Shut up and take this customer's order!\"   Nor do I find it necessary to have three people manning one cash register to take a drink order.   The incompetence was so high that the third customer in a string of wrong orders actually said, \"Y'all need to get fired or something. You're terrible at your jobs.\"  Take a cue from the Greatest Wendy's Location Of All Time (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/wendys-toronto-2) and work on whizzing through long lineups of grumpy customers with a 100% success rate, K?"}
{"text":"Went for a coffee since McDonald's and Starbucks was closed at 11pm. What I got was disappointing. I don't care that it was weak but I did mind that it wasn't even lukewarm, the sugar packets was soaked in spilled coffee since they decided to put my cup of coffee in a paper bag. Oh well, I know what not to order."}
{"text":"This is the WORST Wendy's around the west valley. I live in Buckeye and when I feel like being dissatisfied I end up here. Not really, I normally go thinking this time will be better, but they never fail to disappoint. EVERY TIME I go they either mess something up on an order, completely lose my order (via mobile - only did that once), or something is always missing from my order when I get home. The quality of the food is subpar compared to others. I have tried to call in about an issue only to be met with a never ending busy signal. (Pretty sure they leave the phone off the hook.) - I will NOT be back to this location after my last issue and I just emailed the \"District Manager\" listed on the bottom of my receipt. Doubtful I will get a response. Bottom line - if you are local to Buckeye or even just stopping off the 10 - choose another place to eat unless you want mediocre food and horrible service."}
{"text":"The reason why fast food workers should never earn more than minimum wage is this restaurant.   A teenager took our order. We waited for the order. He never sent it to the back. We waited some more. And more. Smh.   Food came out hot. Ish."}
{"text":"They are rude every single time. There's a BK and a McDonalds down the street.  Save yourself the headache... and time of having to walk back in after they screwed up your drive thru order."}
{"text":"This location provided the usual experience you'd expect at a Wendy's.  The dining area was pretty clean.  The was good.  The cashier was friendly.  The restroom was clean.  The service was somewhat fast.  It met my expectations."}
{"text":"Went to this location the other day (april 14) and had a terrible experience. We wanted to dine in so we went inside and looked over menu. We stood at the counter for about 4 minutes without any acknowledgment while we watched 3 or 4 employees crowded around the drive through window. We yelled \"excuse me\" to get someone's attention and had two separate employees look up at us, but nobody approached us. After about 5 or 6 minutes we left and took our business elsewhere. I will never return to this location again."}
{"text":"This place was an ordering disaster. No one seemed to know what was going on.  The food was just as good as any other Wendy's.  Don't go here unless you have a lot of patience and time to waste.  The manager did apologize for the wait and stopped by our table to check on us."}
{"text":"I came to this establishment at 11:40pm, and I wanted to write this review to specifically compliment the employee named Jesse who helped us out. Despite it being so late, he was incredibly friendly and attentive. It's not often that I'm impressed with drive thru employees, but Jesse really stood out to me in a great way. Thank you for making my night, Jesse!"}
{"text":"After 3 bad experiences here, I will never return!! After 2 bad experiences I decided to give one them more chance at drive through. I won't go into all the details, but to say I was shocked at the horrible customer service. I don't think I have ever had such rude service anywhere. Then when he shorted me $3 he was even ruder giving me my correct change. I was shocked someone like that is working with the public. Then I get home and of course my order is wrong. Even though they are the nearest one, I will go out of my way to go to another location next time."}
{"text":"This is, far and away... not my favourite Wendy's. Standard menu applies, but the fries never seem all that fresh, the staff always harried, and the restaurant layout just feels weird. The condiments and accessories station right beside the counter doesn't work well for proper flow - some buffer distance should be allowed so you don't get people tripping over each other.  Also, the LCD on one of the PIN pads has more non-working lines than working, which just bugs me.  Parking lot is laughably weird, probably because I don't drive. Buildings added as an afterthought to a sea of pavement kind of deal.  It's better than McDonalds, but Licks is only a little bit farther from my office, and shawarma is in the same plaza as this place."}
{"text":"This is the worst Wendy's I have been to, terrible service, inside is not clean. We ordered, waited 10 mins then learned they were out of food."}
{"text":"Food is consistently cold and cooked LONG before.  Definitely one of the worst Wendys out there."}
{"text":"5 stars for 4 star service ? Why because all fast food places have their issues. This location is no different. The advantage? Management makes the difference. I eat here too much and when I have had issues not only have they made it good but they've implemented some course of action to do something to make headway for the next time."}
{"text":"Food quality is consistent. Service is fast, day, night or midnight. The staff are friendly and serves with a smile. I think they really pay attention to the details because I've experienced doing bulk and detailed orders and they get it right down to the last detail. Even the number of straws in the bag. Oh, I've had several experiences with drive-in counters where they forget to include the straws for drinks and smoothies. That gets to be frustrating especially when you're on the road, thirsty and you have to pull over to drink because they forgot straws.  The only issue I have with this branch is the U-turn to the drive thru. With cars parked on the left side. It makes a full one time U-turn difficult."}
{"text":"Good location at the heart of outlet malls! Quick snacks work best when your busy checking-out all the sale at the stores.  Like all Wendy's store, service is fast and efficient.  Food quality is the same in all branches.  Best bets are : cheesy cheddar burger, vanilla frostie, chicken nuggets, spicy chicken wrap (crispy or grilled), pink lemonade is good!  Price is good! Very good! Path to drive thru can be confusing."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 15 minutes with 4 people in front of us. No sense of urgency. So slow! Never again!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst fast food restaurant in town. Don't get me wrong. The food is decent. But the establishment is ridiculous! The drive thru lines are outrageously slow & long. The people at the window are RUDE and not helpful at all. And God forbid you need a condiment with your meal. They won't ask you if you want one and get irritated when you do ask. It's just as bad on the inside. Slow lines. I purposely won't come here just because of their terrible service and EXPENSIVE prices!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had bad food here. This is my favorite Wendy's. Staff is always friendly in the drive through. I do go early in the day usually around 11, just before the rush. Plenary of drink options. View of Ray rd as you people watch inside. Fire place inside as well."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a few years since the Harley Davidson location closed next store. Came in for a quick bite. Tried the new 3 pc chicken strip mean. I don't recommend it can def tell it's frozen and fried it was very rubbery. Fries extremely loaded in salt and all small tiny pieces. Ended up getting a cheeseburger since I didn't eat the chicken. Burger was ok. Soda was good but damn cup filled with ice too to bottom as usual here. Staff friendly place was clean enough."}
{"text":"Well they were short handed today only four people on guy behind the counter said a bunch of people called out. This slowed everything down to a halt. Drive through was even backed up. We had a much longer than normal wait. Food was as expected. Even though short handed sounded like a party behind the scenes a lot of hooting and shouting going on.  The wait for some people seemed forever. I got a cool video on my phone while waiting of a cricket crawling around the floor at the counter to entertain me. I'll still be back convenient location."}
{"text":"the poor girl at the counter taking orders had the voice of Minnie Mouse so faint I couldn't understand her. I don't think she understood me either asking for no tomato threw her into chaos. Little bit of an attitude. Food took a while to arrive at counter and the place wasn't super busy but the help seemed extremely confused and unable to read the tickets and place the food into the proper trays. A bit concerning.  Food was as expected ok for what it is four for four meal. Vanilla frosty mix was out as well.  restrooms was ok and clean."}
{"text":"So this place is terrible. I there was cum all over the toilet seat. And someone wrote \"big ol titties\" on the mirror."}
{"text":"Typical Wendy's would have been better if there was friendly staff however they were polite just no smiles"}
{"text":"So I haven't had Wendy's in years.. Had their lunch value menu 2 double patty cheeseburger .. Ok I'm not going to say it didn't taste ok but it was dripping greasy.. Made my stomach sick.. Also no lines and you still have to wait for your meal.. Took long.."}
{"text":"BOMB , I don't think they have ever really disappointed . Area isn't the greatest but I don't care . When I'm going for the dollar menu I can't really complain lol ."}
{"text":"I come here for a simple value meal lunch. Andi does a good job taking orders and is very polite. Never crowded and the food is always hot and juicy."}
{"text":"One of the closer Wendy's. My wife and I do not go here very often anymore. We had food missing from our order, cold or burnt sandwiches, and salads that were very wilted.   The lights for the restaurant and drive through are turned off some nights at 9 or 10 pm. It doesn't seem like they are open. We went through the drive through and were the only ones there. A lot of service errors for just us being served.   Would gladly go back if the service and quality went back up."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch today. I usually forget this location because it's hidden behind the circle k. When I first pulled into the drive thru I was like UGH because there was six cars in front of me, but service was fast and friendly and I was literally in and out of there in five minutes. Food was good fries could of been fresher that's the only reason for it not being a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Year One Review Update: I wish I could give this restaurant a negative one star. Each time I come to order there is always something wrong with my order. They always leave something out like a juice box or a fry. If you eat here make sure that they are charging you the right price. They overcharge when you order a kids meal with the Apple slices. I asked him to correct this last time and two months later the problem still exist. I ended up calling corporate and asking them to look into this matter. Hopefully they will fix this because they're overcharging customers with each meal. I still like the food because it's fresh however their staff leaves much to be desired.  Read my prior review for complete updates. Also the 4 for 4 dollar meal deal is great includes bacon jr burger, fries, 4 nuggets, and a drink"}
{"text":"Restaurant review How do you judge a fast food restaurant? By there freshness of the food, the cleanliness, and the staff. I ended up here to get a quick salad to go for lunch (trying to be healthy and the summer salads are great!). The food was definitely prepared fast and the restaurant was clean even though I was taking out the food. Staff friendliness was so so. The cashier barely looked me in the eye as I put in my order. At least they take expired jr frosty coupons which was given to me at another location as a substitute for kids toys as they ran out. The sald itself was very fresh and filled to the brim. I had no issue with the quality. I didn't even realize they gave me two packets of salad dressing. One is definitely not enough. Overall if I want Wendy's close to work i will be back maybe through the drive thru next time.  Pros: inexpensive, fast service, clean  Cons: lack of interaction and poor eye contact with staff  Hidden deals: The 4 for four is a steal. A drink, fries, 4 nuggets, and a jr bacon cheeseburger. Favorite fast food meal of the summer 2016"}
{"text":"Wendy's is a great place to a cheap meal.  it's greasy and delicious and mildly addicting like most fast food is.    the service was fast and efficient and the servers were friendly."}
{"text":"Wendy's in general is getting good at their customer service and the speed of their cooking. My food came out in less than a minute, and an employee even came around asking if we wanted any refill. Wendy's has definitely found a good strategy to win customers again and again."}
{"text":"Mary runs a top notch operation at this Wendy's, I don't like throwing 5 star reviews every where I go, but this place deserves it. Whether there is a line of 10 people or no line at all, you're out of there within minutes, and my order has always been correct. It makes me think that all fast food restaurants would have a better rap if they adopted the way she runs the store. It's nice to know that I'll truly be in-n-out in no time at all. Thanks for the good service Mary.  -A customer right down the street."}
{"text":"Stopped here after work because I was starving and everything else was closed. I thought it would be super quick. I waited in line for 20 minutes, only to be given the wrong bag of food. I parked my car illegally and ran back inside after opening the sandwich wrapper to realize it wasn't even a chicken sandwich, it was a cheeseburger. I gave the food back to them, thinking they were going to throw it away. Nope, they handed it to a drive through customer. Absolutely disgusting. I also couldn't eat the chicken sandwich they gave me because it had about three slices of cheese on it. This location is a hot ass mess and it's ruined Wendy's in general for me. Get your shit together, guys."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru, and the food was good and hot, but the staff was not friendly, I mean no hello, hi, how is your day just the total and that barely got out. I mean aren't drive thru and dining places suppose to be friendly. I know I would be, the employee gave us our ticket and debit card back, but never once say \"Thank You\" or \"Can I get anything for you\" Also asked if we already had straws, really, shouldn't you know if two seconds earlier you gave us drinks. Not sure if the employee was unable about being at their job or what. I mean if you don't like your job then you have options to go elsewhere to work, because you are representing the company and want customers to return, but having an unpleasant experience is something I will remember and will not return to this location."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I like the spicy chicken combo.  This is a great place for a cheap dinner with the lady.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They have to be the worst Wendy's if ever been to I  my life.  Horrible horrible horrible.  Slow service,  bad customer service and they completely forgot my order. Zero stars.Stop Hiring these retards and crackheads off the street please"}
{"text":"It's Wendy's. Burger was good, fries were fresh and soda was cold. No seating available at the restaurant, I had to find a seat in the terminal. No surprises."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru. Received NO straws. Had to go inside for straws. WTF was the point of the drive thru!!! So inconvenient!!!"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be impressed by a Wendy's but I was starving so I rolled through the drive-thru for a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger. The driver through girl was cheerful and spoke understandable English so that was nice. And the burger was ready when I got to the window.   As I was leaving and tearing into my JBC I paused to appreciate it's construction...it looked like it should! Meaning someone obviously took the 1.5 more seconds it takes to make sure the patty, cheese, bacon, etc are actually lined up into a organized stack vice a total mess with half the cheese hanging out like some fast food joints (*cough...McDonalds).  And it tasted REALLY good! And I'm pretty sure that's not just because I was starving."}
{"text":"terrible the girl in front started asking the guy why ate you wearing gloves. he said \"people actually thank me for wearing gloves\".we actually thanked him for wearing gloves. plus the girl was very very rude!"}
{"text":"Had spicy chicken sandwiches and fries,mine was served fresh my husbands was not.Service was good.. extremely dirty. Hard to get to right now due to road construction"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch today, what a mistake!  Not because the food was bad, it wasn't.  I have never seen, or in this case heard, a group of employees constantly arguing among themselves.  It was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I was looking for In N Out Burgers in the area thinking I'd seen one in the area. Nope, there's a Wendy's instead. I thought to myself...hmmm, I haven't had a Wendy's burger in what...2 decades? Well it's late at night and I figured it couldn't hurt, plus I was really hungry. Let's just say Wendy's burgers look, feel and taste very sorry. Please dear management-do something about this. Go out to other fast food burger places (eg In n Out) and then compare. Not spending my money here anymore."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill fast!  The staff makes it feels like you are bothering them when you order.  And 90% of the time your order is wrong.  Such a dissappointment!"}
{"text":"i had to give it one star if it were up to me i would give it no star !!!!!!!   this wendys needs help  * messy  *drug addict employees  *employees manager relations  *cold , stale food. *unprofessional staff  * employees smoking in the front or by the dumpster coming back in and handling food .  this place should really be shut down."}
{"text":"Slow and very dumb. I'm sorry but that's really how it is here. Get ready to wait for your order."}
{"text":"Thank you for taking my order Frank. Your upbeat friendly world class service has definitely made my day. Oh the vanilla frosty, nuggets and honey mustard dip hit the craving spot on.  --Said so by the lady who left her frosty tag at home; and turns to the wrong direction after paying-haha. Thanks man."}
{"text":"I'm just plain pissed the employees there are honestly useless. None of my order was right some stuff wasn't even in the bag. Then when I was checking the bag they were being rude and acting like I didn't know what I was talking about. I used to love this Wendy's but I'll never be back. Their service sucks and their food sucks too."}
{"text":"Horrible service left a burger out of my order and told us to go back because they said they would compensate the meal and give us a sandwich which was the manager brenda who apparently hasn't finished training. Now i go back in today and the other manager Nancy was getting arguementive saying she cant do anything and would not fulfill the promised customer service. Not to mention the rest of the staff gave extremely dirty looks, and also disrespectful and threw the burger on the counter at us..... Definately losing my business for good."}
{"text":"For a Wendy's, I really like this one. Everyone is always really nice to me, and the store is super clean. No complaints.  Also, these chains need to start posting their hours!"}
{"text":"For fast food, this was pretty good. It was actually fresh and tasty food.  Bonus for techies and those of us who have nomadic offices: they have a plug-in station and free Wi-Fi.  Everyone working there must've been tired (or bored). No one smiled."}
{"text":"Well they f'ed me at the Drive thru. Simple order just 2 double stacks paid cash just under $5 and drove away. I made it home and opened bag to 2 singles. Not worth the drive back to complain would have left survey if they would have put a recite in bag like they said. I did try to call location just rang and rang. Well at least they gave me correct change. To think fast food workers want to make $15/hour. They can't even make a burger right."}
{"text":"I received 5 star service and a hot breakfast sandwich. Yes, it was greasy, buttery goodness, but it's fast food at an airport. There's nothing at an airport in Las Vegas that's good for your health (either physical or financial).  For $5.83 with tax, the panini melt is just a little bite that doesn't break the bank. Next time I'll see if I can't pay extra to have a slice of tomato added. Not that any of the calories from the sausage and cheese will count less. Maybe it's good that it's a small sandwich."}
{"text":"Second time they got my order wrong. If you go to this location, stop in the lot and look through your bag."}
{"text":"The drive through is fast and accurate and the food is always hot. For a fast food place in very impressed and will definitely come back for their hamburgers and fresh lemonade. The lemonade is so delicious I'm addicted! The staff is also very polite :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be the best place to get a burger, but I find the service and quality has gone down. I find the restaurant is not always as clean as it could be. The staff need to clear tables faster during busy periods. The staff are very pleasant but it can be slow. Overall, Wendy's itself is not such a great chain anymore.They have not been able to keep pace with other changes in the fast food industry, like at McDonalds for instance. Anyways, Wendy's is ok, but its' far from the best out there"}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars for this location. I went there tonight after a long day of work then parent teacher conferences expecting to grab dinner quickly & feed my kids but NO!! 1st of all I waited for a good 15 minutes at the speaker until finally someone took my order then I get to the window & the girl hands ma an extra drink & I say to her I didn't order this & she said oh well happy birthday I guess & shrugs her shoulders. Ok I get home & give my kids their food except for my 4 year old..they did not include her kids meal in the bag...so I pack up my kids in the car & drive back to Wendy's. I went inside & spoke to the \"manager\" Geno & he starts explaining to me about \"being understaffed\" & training a new drive thru team member. As I tell Geno that the customer should not have to pay for Wendy's short staff or training. I work in customer service & this by far has been one of my top 5 WORSE experiences. I will not be returning to this particular Location in"}
{"text":"My husband and ate here in the dining room area today. It was clean and had a nice view of the strip. I would especially like to thank Maggie for her excellent service! We had some coupons to use and I have some allergies so our order was a bit more complicated. She double checked for order accuracy and remained calm and friendly even though the lady behind us in line was starting to stomp her foot with impatience. Our food came out the moment we were done ordering. Hot and fresh which was great because we were starving! Thanks Maggie and the Wendy's team for the fast and excellent service! :)"}
{"text":"Its 7 a_m and their not open whays going on there. When I went up to the drive thru there wasn't even a breakfast menu up"}
{"text":"Every experience at this Wendy's has been a bad one. Never going to this location again after constantly having bad service with different employees. Actually had a guy eating while making my food. Licked his fingers and used the same fingers to place my fries in a bag. While doing so he touched my fries with those fingers. Not to mentioned I waited there for almost 15 minutes and my order was wrong. Tonight, my last time at this location, I was greeted on the intercom by a very rude employee and got home to an almost completey raw burger. Wendy's really needs to look into there franchises and get some of this straightened out. Negative stars for me on this one."}
{"text":"To my mind, besides serving very good hamburgers, Wendy's Chili is so excellent and satisfyingly delicious that it is award worthy.  Allowed to simmer for hours, this mixture of nicely seasoned Kidney Beans, Pinto Beans, pieces of tomato, onion, celery, and lean beef drenched in a great kicky sauce is hard to beat.  So much so that I almost never leave a Wendy's without ordering Chili along with a burger and fries.  My square and rather flat quarter-pound burger topped with a single slice of American Cheese, and a fresh tomato slice, lettuce, pickles, and ketchup on a soft bun was quite tasty.  But, alas, the skin-on fries were sort of dead tasting, with no hint of salt.  3-1/2 stars overall on my single visit here!"}
{"text":"I visited this location Tuesday 5/9/17 during my lunch, and had a horrible experience. It is the Wendy's on Eastway Dr. This was a drive-thru order. I ordered a spicy chicken Caesar salad/half-size. I got back to work, ate half of the salad when I noticed a ladybug at the bottom of my salad! Needless to say I got sick right away because I don't know if I had eaten anymore that could've been in the salad that I didn't see. I had 4 co-workers that saw the bug in my salad as well. I tried to contact this location and speak to a manager, wasn't able to get anyone on the phone that wanted to deal with this and was put on hold several times. I provided feedback via the main Wendy's website, didn't hear anything back. Contacted the main corporate number and wasn't able to get anyone on the phone. I messaged on their main FB page and after a day their response was \" Stephanie, we are so disappointed to see this! Thank you for providing the location where this occurred. What is your phone number so we can have management get in touch with you to make this right? Thank you!\" So I provided my contact information. Another day goes by and their next response was \"Thank you for that. The management team for this location will be in touch with you to make this right. Have a great day!\" Guess what? No one contacted me! Isn't that a surprise?! I definitely will not be back to that location, and probably will not have any salads from Wendy's or any salads for a while. How unprofessional this company is, not wanting to make this right! I know it could've been worse, like a bat or a roach in the salad....a ladybug is a bug and shouldn't have been in my food period! Be aware of what could be in your food, especially from this place!"}
{"text":"Ever since they got rid of the older drive thru lady that would hang your bag out of the window impatiently waiting for you to pull forward this place had improved a lot. Food is good. Service is great. I would recommend."}
{"text":"They always get my order wrong and whenever I order diet I always get regular. The only thing keeping me coming back to this restaurant is this fact that inexplicably the McDonald's next door is worse."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute shit show. Like what the fuck can you at least try now. Dumb ass shit how about when you drop some niggas burger dont give it back to him."}
{"text":"Not open 24 hours. Arrived at 11:30 pm and was informed that they were closed, ready to leave, and reopen at 5 am."}
{"text":"Not open until 9am Everyday, how are we supposed to get breakfast before work, ridiculous. Im done with wendys"}
{"text":"This is the best bad customer service story I've had happen to me yet. So I place my order and was given my total. I drove up to the window and handed the cashier my debit card which he ran through and as soon as he had ran it through I heard him say \"Oh we are out?\". I wasn't sure if he had meant that regarding my order so I didn't say anything. He placed my receipt next to the terminal and handed me back just my debit card. He walk away from the window for a moment and I heard again \"So we are out?\". After a minute or so they handed me the bag which of course at this point I'm interested to see if I was missing something. He had stepped away from the window and as I was looking down I heard him repeat \"Ah.... he just checked\". At this point I decided it wasn't worth dealing with a missing order of french fries because of a few reasons. First they obviously withheld the receipt so I wouldn't have an order number to go off of or prove that it was ordered. Second they knowingly handed my order to me with an item missing and decided to just not tell me. Third the reaction of getting caught rather then realizing you did something wrong just makes it not worth dealing with them. For the approximately $2 it cost me for fries at the McDonald's up the street I just wasn't willing to deal with people who don't care. So I'd recommend a few things. First don't intentionally hide an issue from a customer. Second just because you think a customer isn't paying attention doesn't mean they didn't hear you. Lastly if you made a mistake or have an issue deal with the customer directly instead of waiting to see if you are caught. I do appreciate the experience though because every time I have a customer service class to do I now have the perfect experience to explain what poor customer service is."}
{"text":"I used to be love Wendy's, but this particular location ruined it for me. After a dozen experiences where the order was completely wrong or missing something, I would still visit because it was the only Wendy's in a 5 mile radius...so they couldn't possibly get it wrong THIS time, could they?? Sure they could!! I complained on the website and didn't get a response. So I contacted them again to say that I would be contacting the Health Dept. (yes, the food is that bad) and was offered a free meal. And the owner gave this offer on an email forwarded to him from corporate (respond to this issue within 24 hours!!). What a joke. The food here is sub-par, takes forever to prepare, and still won't be correct. Wendy's is pricey as far as fast-food is concerned and your money will be wasted here."}
{"text":"So just came back home from wendys after i ordered a pretzel bun burger with chicken ...open the bag and surprise I got a regular burger with bacon wtf ..really it took just a min to order and get the order and it was not even busy !"}
{"text":"Before I start, I Love Wendy's. It's by far in my opinion the best of all the Fast Food joints.  With that being said, both the Wendy's locations closest to me are the absolute worst.  Brook park rd near ridge rd and the location on Broadview. I'm convinced the location on brook park near ridge will never be better and is an absolute lost cause. The location on Broadview is close to that. They are extremely slow. I can go in because there are 10 cars in the driveway, and I'm the only person at the counter, and by the time I walk out the drive thru lane is empty. The employees attitudes are horrible toward each other. No sense of a team atmosphere and no leadership. I asked a female manager to refund my money the last time I was there because of the remarks I heard from the employees toward each other and how little attention was paid to the paying customer. She apologized with the saddest look on her face because she knew it was true. She looked as if she'd been given a rag tag bunch of employees who had no customer service skills, no work ethic, and we're just kickin it at work. Really, I have to wait 20 mins for a large fry and 6 piece nugget??? While I watch the whole time as food flies out of the fast food drive thru window. If I were the district or regional manager I would secret shop these two locations. They suck!! Damn, and I love Wendy's."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered food from here just because all the other food places were too busy. We're literally the only customers, there were 4 employees. 2 guys in the back making the burgers, 1 guy texting on his phone while making fries, and 1 lady to take orders and pretend to be manager. Our orders came 15 minutes later, the burger guys handed my sandwich over to the fries guy While the fries guy was texting, he threw my sandwich over his shoulder. Wth. One of those guys that just work just to say they work, end up working in a fast food joint for the rest of his life type of guys, anyways. If the manager doesn't care about his actions, shows a lot about an establishment. Hope wendys corp knows about how these lazy people run their branch"}
{"text":"Terrible!  Out of bottle water, juice boxes, ketchup packets!!  Apples in kids meal were spoiled!"}
{"text":"They had these fantastic kids working there last fall after the remodel. It was great. And 6 months later they're all gone. The owner or manager must just be a complete piece of garbage who doesn't pay their employees or is terrible to work for, because now this place is back to scraping the bottom of the barrel of people who either don't care about working there or have nowhere else to get a job. Extremely slow service, orders are wrong, sandwich buns are squashed flat on dine-in orders... they can't even keep ketchup in the pumps. This place had everything going for it and in six months it's back to the mess it was before the remodel. What a waste."}
{"text":"Ran out of biscuits before the end of breakfast hours, and that's not cool.  Staff was reasonably polite about it though.  Quite a bit of riff-raff as far as customers go, but maybe that's just the area.  Ton of pepper in the eggs.  What the heck?"}
{"text":"Atrocious service & failure to manage a simple breakfast selection of food.  Biscuits? Sorry, we're out for awhile.  Hashbrown potatoes? Sorry, we're out right now.  Fries? No we're out of those too.  So I order the panini breakfast sandwich without meat.  When I get to my gate, I see the sandwich is also lacking egg (meaning it's just the cheese & condiments on it).  Brilliant folks working here... brilliant!"}
{"text":"One of the few fast food places that is always fast with breakfast.  Choice of biscuits, \"fricuits\", etc. are a nice alternative to other breakfast options from most of the competition.  Reasonable prices too.  Safe area."}
{"text":"Worst Wendy's I've been to in years.  Slow, poor service.  They couldn't make up their mind at the end of breakfast hours how many people would be allowed to get their breakfast orders, and who would be forced to change orders to lunch.  Total incompetence here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just got home from Wendy's started eating our food and halfway in realized his sandwich had a piece of paper in it !!!! Not kidding it looks like something that may have been wrapped around the chicken maybe? Idk but I don't think I'll be eating from here without checking every inch of my food...."}
{"text":"I mean it is a Wendy's, let's be honest people.  If this is your idea of a good Friday night dinner, you probably don't like yelp anyway.    This location is the closest fast food joint to my house so if I ever have the (not so frequent) craving for fast food, this is where I'd hit up.  I've never eaten inside because let's face it, it's a Wendy's.  But, the drive through has always been quick and the line is never more than a car or two.  My order has always been correct and about as good as it is going to get!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! I went today and picked up food only to get home and attempt to eat my burger when I found a gross hair in it! I called and the manager and he started questioning me and making it seem like I was lying, said well I don't know who it could have been because the only person with black hair is the cashier I told him well it's not mine since I have long hair and this was a short black hair. All he said was thanks for telling me never saying sorry or offering to exchange it. Not that I would ever want anything from this place again. Gross and on top of that rude manager..."}
{"text":"Like many I wouldn't even think on reviewing a fast food restaurant but on this occasion I have to...if I could give this restaurant a minus two starts it wouldn't be because the food...my girlfriend loves it and I tend to enjoy their chili...is good!!...on August 19 I wanted to enjoy chili for lunch and offer my girlfriend to bring one for her , so on my way home I decided to run by the drive thru as many time I have done...the staff has always been great but to my surprise this time was the very unprofessional manager who was at the window with the other female employee...I normally will ask for extra crackers for our chili and I have never ever before had been refuse by anyone to drop a few more into the bag...this time the very unprofessional manager refuse to give me some extra after telling me that each chili order gets two packages!!..yet my order which was two chili's only had three in the bag..now..either she was having a bad day and for that she shouldn't be either at the restaurant much less the window or she needs to get her attitude check or be retrain in customer service and customer satisfaction..I don't plan to return to that restaurant as long this lady is there...I forgive but don't forget because as she is I am in the customer service and as much as I may be having a bad day I don't feel a customer should take anyone's frustrations and she shouldn't take hers on anyone...maybe that's why the employees aren't happy working there either!!...well hope the red hair girl do something about this she got great commercials.."}
{"text":"Dave Thomas would turn over in his grave if he saw this location.  Rude employees, inedible food and terrible service.  No more of this location.  Sadly it was great when I was a kid."}
{"text":"I visisted this Wendy's often when I first started working nearby in Shadyside. But I quickly learned my lesson. I got tired of spending 20 minutes of my lunch break waiting in line. No less than 20 minutes. Every. Single. Time. The drive-thru is only slightly faster at 10-15 mins. Plus, the staff is rude. I've driven out of my way a few times to the Wendy's in Wilkinsburg just to avoid this place.  Anyway, I have no qualms with the food, as it's the same as any other Wendy's. So it's fine if you have time to kill."}
{"text":"Wendy's never frozen meat, doesn't mean much when you take the burger patties out of a bin pre cooked and nasty.  Hot off the grill...False advertising to the max!  Fries were dead!   Doesn't ever deserve one star."}
{"text":"This place is really hit or miss.   If I'm greeted at the drive through by what sounds like a young lady still in high school then I tend to get pretty decent food. That experience is more common during the day.  If I'm first greeted at the drive through by what sounds like an over the top radio personality but then my order is taken by someone who sounds more urban then in my experience I'm better off just driving away. This is the norm if I show up at night.  I've reveived %80 of the nuggets that I ordered, gotten burgers that were undercooked and had sandwiches with buns so covered in grease that I gagged and threw them away.   As usual I don't blame the employees as much as the management. FInd a way to motivate these people to make food I can eat. Until then I'll be at the Arby's down the street."}
{"text":"I love Wendy's, but this location is a filthy mess. Not to mention they don't know how to fry chicken (see my photo of the raw spicy chicken breast they served me)."}
{"text":"Now you cant use any cards because the news said this Wendy's was breached. So use cash or go elsewhere.  I like Burger King !"}
{"text":"Will not be going back to this location anytime soon. Would defiantly stop at McDonald's,Burger King, or Carl's Jr. before going there. Went through the drive when it was not busy at all. There was only one car behind and the lady handing me my food was in such a rush. I always ask for 2 extra barbecue sauces when I get meal. The only reason I choose Wendy's over McDonald's is because I love the barbecue sauce. The lady told me I could only have one, even after I offered to pay for an extra sauce. She said sorry we don't sell extra sauce. Like is it really that serious to be so stingy with the sauce. Like I can't even pay for the sauce??? I only when eat my fry's and nuggets when I can dip every single one in the sauce. So disappointed."}
{"text":"First off I love Wendy's and it kills me to have to review this store in such a negative light.   It was apparent upon standing in line behind two people that the cashier was new and or just a little uncomfortable working the register by herself and need much more training before being left alone.   It took over 15 minutes to process two orders, one of which was a single senior citizen who only wanted a single with cheese and a cup of coffee.  I on the other hand ordered $35 worth of value meals, a salad and a Bacon Cheddar baked potato. The value meals were OK but they gave me the wrong type of potato and a wrong type of salad. I did check that we had the right quantity but didn't check foe the small details so part of it is my fault but not all of it.  With all those value meals one of the managers there (she was wearing a red shirt in comparison to the regular grunts) asked if I wanted a drink carrier? How the heck was she expecting one guy to carry all that food and drinks by himself?   When my Fiancée called to complain a male answered the phone saying he was the manager. When I was there a middle aged lady in a white shirt was walking around and even came out to give the senior citizen his discount. Don't know why the phone wasn't handed to the real manager but I'm sure he is going to tell his manager one of his co workers screwed up a large order. Yeah right he will tell her about as sure as we will be back, IE never!"}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't impressed. My Fiancee attempted to use the bathroom before ordering and came running out saying there was human waste on the toliet seats and she couldn't go. We reported it to the cashier who just shrugged it off. We never saw anyone leave the kitchen area to go service the bathrooms.  Our food, or what they served us as food was horribly disappointing. We ordered three meals. The daughter and my fIancee had to send their burgers back. Both were icy cold. The fries were super soggy and were most likely sitting out for a long time before being served.   Management remade the burgers gave fresh fries but failed to give the burgers back with the proper toppings. After taking them back a 2nd time we ate our meals.  On the way home the girls got super sick. My spicy. Chicken sandwich didn't seem to upset my tummy but having to pull over to let them throw up leads me to believe we won't ever be back. Too bad because with a movie theather across the parking lot could have prompted a few repeat visits."}
{"text":"This is the worst fast food garbage pit!  I would give it minus if I could! The hamburger meat tasted burnt and bad! Took two bites and threw the rest of it out! Didn't even bother with the fries! The atmosphere was awful and uninviting. It was lunch hour and there were three people, one of them looked like he was homeless, dirty and hanging around the drink center! It was hot too! Ok, enuf!  Hope Wendy's Corp looks at the reviews of this place! Close it down or change all the employees! Horrible!"}
{"text":"Looks like we were the first customers of the day. One employee was sitting in the dinning area watching Netflix (with no earbuds) and didn't even realize we were there till we were almost done eating. Was complaining the whole time that it was so slow. And my husband was served cold chili. Not the best experience"}
{"text":"I recently drove thru on a roadtrip.  The service was friendly, the food was just as I ordered."}
{"text":"This Wendy's has a place close to my heart.  Probably because the location is right near my high school and we used to go here all the time after school - after track practice.  I know it's \"fast food\" but HS metabolisms are out the roof so we pretty much could eat anything and everything.  But out of all the fast food chains....Wendy's did seem the more 'healthier' of the choices and even sponsored one of the largest cross country event races in the state.  This location seems like it's been a while, but they have done a lot to maintain it... updating it... and keeping it clean.  This location also has one of those old skool sun room sitting areas which is great since you don't see that very often anymore.  Even though the food is fast... they do offer some better choicees on the menu.  I also noticed that they posted the nutritional information right on the wall before you order.... so I was scoping out my choice's caloric values while waiting in line."}
{"text":"This Wendy's looks to be less than a year old, but it's not kept very well.  It may have been bad timing, but it seems like none of the tables were wiped up and the bathroom was super dirty.  When we came in, there wasn't a large crowd or anything... it's a shame since the inside would be nice if it was just tidied up.  The parking lot is very awkwardly designed.  You have to park on the side of the building and it seems like the drive-thru was the main forethought here.  Service was super slow and the staff didn't seem that friendly.  I only ordered a frosty and it seemed like the employee was pulling teeth when mixing up the oreos into it.  I still enjoyed the frosty, but it made it way less fun to see that the person making it was miserable."}
{"text":"I don't think a lot of people are aware of this Wendy's because it is never busy, including the drive thru which is a good thing in my opinion.  You can pretty much pull up and there's only one other car in front of you.  Prices at Wendy's seem to higher than other fast food places but you also need to consider that the food here is typically fresh.  Burgers are not frozen and you get a good percentage of burger with your buns around here.    Service-wise is hit or miss just like any other fast food place.  It just depends on the mood of the person you are dealing with.  Oh well. what can you expect from minimum wage jobs?"}
{"text":"Just in case you don't live here and need some Wendy's...this one is permanently closed."}
{"text":"Service at the counter was nice, but there are 2 employees taking up the WiFi counter watching employee training videos out loud without headphones and falling asleep, so that's not the greatest."}
{"text":"11 minutes in my world is not fast food,,,,went through drive thru took 4 minutes to even order then when ordered sat at window for another 8 minutes .. i was asked what i ordered i said a double stack and small fry..the cashier called for another double stack....they had given mine away....the gentleman whom handed me my food knew i was upset handed me my bag and said there ....hesitant to even eat this i did ...ice cold are you sure your beef is not frozen. probably should have got a burger from circle k."}
{"text":"Literally the worst place. The workers are always assholes and upset. It'll ruin your whole mood. Stay away."}
{"text":"This place is DISGUSTING!!! The dining room has ZERO clean tables, trash on the ground, ketchup all over the counter, chairs moved in places they shouldn't be, trash overflowing! GROSS!   This entire restaurant needs to be replaced! The employees walk around like they are zombies, they aren't friendly! Except the girl that took our order, she was the best part of the entire visit! The food was cold, the fries were half cooked and over leaded with salt! I should have left before we even ordered.   Worse service ever when needing a refill! We are done here! NEVER COMING BACK! Read your reviews and fix your place before the health district comes and shuts you down!! Yuck!"}
{"text":"I believe the reason why they have a drive thru is that customers don't want to get out of the car. Most of us are always in a hurry and we need a quick bite to eat.  So I  was going through the drive thru as I always do, get to the speaker box, and told that sorry it would be quicker to come inside because we are going through a shift change @ 4 pm in the afternoon???   Don't you think if I wanted to come inside, that I would ??? Hmmmmm  I just drove away, I guess I caught them at a bad time and a frosty and small fry just might be too much of an order during a shift change !!  Sorry to bother you Wendy & Staff !!"}
{"text":"Forgot my cheese for my sandwiches, but didnt forget to charge me! Then when I decided to stand up for all those out there who have been shorted their order, they were closed! You win this round, Wendys. 2 stars for my 2 missing cheeses."}
{"text":"Tired from our mission to check out camping gear at REI, we repaired to Wendy's.  It was before the lunch rush, so it was practically empty. Off-peak visits are the best.  They guy who took our order was questionably cheerful, i.e., so friendly you wonder what's up.  He was the manager.  If I ran Wendy's I'd put this kid in charge of training employees how to be nice to customers.  Maybe he was so happy because the corporate turmoil at Wendy's has finally been settled. Arby's bought them out. I don't think highly of Arby's, so I'm skeptical that forthcoming changes at Wendy's will be good.  This Wendy's appears to be recently remodeled.  I know it's been here for years but it's like new.  I like their chili and baked potatoes. The great thing about Wendy's:  They always ask you if you want cheese on your chili and so on.  Other places aren't as courteous.  Panda Express, for example, will never offer soy sauce, hot mustard, or anything.  You have to ask.    The manager put me in such a good mood that I accepted his suggestion for an ice cream concoction. It was delicious whatever it was."}
{"text":"I come here often it's close to work. Every time I come here I get great service everyone is really friendly. My orders are always fresh and fast. I like Wendy's to begin with but the service makes it that much better."}
{"text":"The management is quite lame and lazy and the food was really cold. I am mot coming back."}
{"text":"Too horrible to waste my time writing a lengthy thoughtful review. As usual, at this location, they got my order wrong. Not at all surprising considering the experience. Woman on speaker so inattentive/dumb it was like a \"who's on first\" conversation. When I tried to clarify with guy working the window, he just interrupted repeatedly to complain about broken, choppy headset equipment and bad management that won't fix things in a timely fashion. Enough said."}
{"text":"I don't usually rate fast food but I visited this Wendy's today and was pleasantly surprised . The service was excellent. The manager walked around asking people how their meals were. He even brought out more sauce for the couple next to us.  The only thing I noticed was the floor area around the Coke machine (the one that you can get a hundred different combination of soft drinks) was wet & dirty from spills. I guess that comes from getting so many options.   I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"This Wendy doesn't stick out any more than other location, nor does it suck more than any other location.   It's just in the middle.  More often than not, they are very good with the their customer service. Only once was I served cold fries and had I not been through the drive thru, I would have went back and asked them to replace them.   It's good fast food, at decent prices."}
{"text":"Same famous hamburgers and fries as all the other Wendy's. Clean, fast, affordable."}
{"text":"The food here is just as good as any other Wendy's. The drive thru is on steroids. They usually are holding the bag out the drive up window before I can pull up to it after ordering. It is too fast. I feel like I'm the hold up when paying."}
{"text":"Same famous hamburgers and fries as all the other Wendy's. However, this location has had more issues with timeliness than any other one that I have been to. Many times I've come by for lunch and the drive-thru is pack and not moving. Then I go inside and it's the same thing. Once I rolled the dice and tried my luck. 18 minutes later, I finally got my chili and fries. Go if there is no line, but if there is one, something's up and it won't be pretty."}
{"text":"I was disgusted by the flies infestation I just asked my money back I didn't even eat there"}
{"text":"Don't usually review fast food joints, unless I find something interesting to write about.  Anyway, Wendy's is not a fast food of choice for me, and until my most recent visit yesterday, I probably have not been to a Wendy's in at least 20 years.  But I was coming back from an appointment, and wanted to grab something fast to snack on before heading over to the Splendor in the Glass Pre Party event at Whole Foods, so I stopped by this Wendy's.  I ordered a few items off of their value menu, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was as far as dollar menu items go.  The Double Stack (I wasn't sure if that was pancakes or burger, and had to asked the cashier) was good and, well, cheap!  Spicy Chicken Sandwich - spicy, not too dried, pretty good.  5 pieces Chicken Nuggets - tiny morsels of flavor, that I can totally snack on while I read.  Being so closed to where I live now, this might just be a nearby fast food place that I will hit up when I need a quick snack in the middle of the night.  Cleanliness - 3/5  Not dirty or super clean. Location - Lakes area 5/5 for me. Food - 3.5/5 For fast food, it is decent. Parking - 3/5  Small lot, but plenty of parking nearby if it gets crowded, especially at night after the bank closes."}
{"text":"Waited for about five minutes to be waited on. Two other people were waiting for food. That's all the people that were there. They finally got their food and I was able to place my order. It seemed like the grill was off and they kept restarting it, because it was another five plus minutes until I received my food. Then, as I am eating my hamburger, I notice it is still pretty pink inside. That's a pretty risky situation, to eat undercooked ground beef. I took it back, got my refund and vowed to myself never to step foot in that Wendy's again. The service has been going downward for years, there. Do yourself a favor and pick another fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Normally, this is my go-to on my way home from a late night at work. Normally, they get everything right, with the exception of the occasional missing sauce. Tonight, however, they screwed the pooch.  I ordered a 4 for $4 meal with a Jr. Bacon cheeseburger AND one extra JBC (that's two sandwiches).  Imagine my surprise when I arrive home to discover only one sandwich. I check the bill, and sure enough, I was charged for two JBCs. To add insult to injury, when I opened the sandwich, I discovered a double cheeseburger. So not only can the staff not count, they apparently can't tell the various sandwiches apart. Morons. From now on, I'm apparently going to have to thoroughly check my order before leaving."}
{"text":"Did the freaking cover of ya'lls salt shaker fall off during the process!? My god! I needed a gallon of water just to get through the night.   I'm not an avid fast food customer but when I do indulge I have 2 places. Taco bell an Wendy's. HUGE disappointment. I'm going to assume for the better because I'll never go back again. My lips are still burning from trying to take down a finger-full of frys. Can you say heart attack!?"}
{"text":"This is not the best Wendy's in the world.  The ONLY reason I go here is because it is the one closest to where I work and sometimes you just need a baked potato and chili.  Every time I've gotten fries here, they are cold and taste like they were cooked the day before.  The workers always seem to be confused and can't ever get an order right.  No mayo apparently means put the whole jar on the sandwich.   The other reviewers are correct in that the area surrounding the restaurant is not the best and you do need to be very careful.  There always seems to be somebody loitering around the parking lot. I would never, ever think about going here at night or alone."}
{"text":"I know it's supposed to be fast food, but this place is always chaos. It takes forever to get your order and good luck if it's correct. I was there today and the place was a mess, sticky drinks spilled all over the counter, the ketchup station, and of course the drink station.  While I was waiting on my food, a young man came up with a broom and started sweeping right where the food was being made for orders. He could have made better use of his time by wiping down the counter tops and getting the sticky goo off the floor.  Sadly, this location was just remodeled within the past year. I won't even go into the staff.  They seem to be in a permanent state of confusion."}
{"text":"Since I work within a half mile, I ate here at least once a week and the food is most always very good and the service is better than most, I don't know that I will return.  I almost always get my food to go, so I didn't think anything about my order a couple of weeks ago other than the fact that  the were not as \"together\" from the order takers (it took 2 to complete my order) to the kitchen help.  I could hear a lot of back & forth from the kitchen and there seemed to be an air of confusion all the way around. I usually go arount 11:15, so they weren't busy, but there were a couple of  men in suits back & forth and a woman who seemed to be in charge, but  it seemed she might have been the cause of the confusion.    I ordered the southwest salad to go and when I got back to the office, I opened the container of chili and was surprised to find nothing but some ground beef, several beans (no more than 4) and plain water.  Nothing resembled chili in the least.   All the other ingredients had been left out!  I ate the salad without the chili, and when I finished I called the 800 # on the receipt and told of my experience.  I was told that I would get a call back within 24 hours. I've not received it yet, so I can assume they could  care less.   I've wondered if anyone else ordered chili and complained?  Will I go back here?  Maybe, maybe not.  But I'll always check my chili before I leave."}
{"text":"Use extreme caution eating here!!! I was here last night with my boyfriend and we both saw one of the employees eating out of several different fry cups that were supposed to be handed out to customers - and later I found a hair in my fries!! Disgusting and I will not be back here until this employee is removed. Also, whenever we come here we usually order separately, but it seems like the employees just assume the order I place is our entire order, because after I order they walk away and my boyfriend is left waiting twenty minutes or more to even order because they ignore him after they're done taking my order (or vice versa if he orders first) terrible service and literally no reason to go back and deal with that."}
{"text":"a huge fan of Wendy's, as it is one of the few \"fast food\" places with a decent tasting chicken sandwich, even better now that they have the jalapeno fresco sandwich, which is to DIE for, complimented with the jalapeno poutine makes for a lip burning good time. I was a skeptic at first, cause I didn't think it would be hot at all, but its so deliciously hot that its keeping me coming back, and making Wendy's my primary go to for a quick bite to eat.  very VERY happy that this location is close to home. lots of parking, staff are friendly, location is very clean.  it loses a point because there's been a couple of times where they haven't been open due to either a staff shortage or a power outage."}
{"text":"short and sweet  great food(very hot and fresh to order)  great staff  clean location  lots of parking  sets the standard for a Wendy's location.  I wish the Wendy's in my neighborhood was this good"}
{"text":"Sad.  Brand new facility.   Filthy floors.  Windows dirty.  Franchise owner should be ashamed.  No better on cleanliness than the old building next door."}
{"text":"It is a fine fast food salad.  Always pretty fresh and just a nice light alternative.  They have the berry salads - seasonally - and I really enjoy those.  I like that they serve Coke not Pepsi and sometimes a spicy chicken combo is just what you want."}
{"text":"We used to have a Wendy's down the street and it was perfect for those nights when you didn't want to cook.  It closed and one of the \"bertos\" burrito places but I digress.  The dollar menu is great ans the choice of fries or salad ia nice.  I also love love love the full size salads.  I miss our old close one but we'll often go for a quick dinner - just further"}
{"text":"Staff here acts like they're doing you a favor by giving you your order.  Charleston and Ft Apache is much better."}
{"text":"After the several months they took to remodel you would think their food would be better.  The hamburger was very dry, the fries were soggy, and the tables were dirty.  I am very disappointed in what I just experienced and will not return.  They did not even put the new tables together correctly so they can be pushed together.  Something is seriously wrong with this place and not worth any person's time."}
{"text":"I like Wendy's but absolutely HATE this one. My girlfriend lives down the street so I used to stop here often. Not once have they put everything in the bag that I order. You get up to the window and they hand you your drink and 10 minutes later the food so your drink is nice and watered down.... everytime without fail. Fuck this place, go down the street to Panda"}
{"text":"The food was typical of a Wendy's (I got the GJBC meal). However, the service was subpar. We went through the drive thru and ended up with a small meal when we wanted the large. We were relatively sure we specified that we wanted a large, but even if we did not, the employee never asked us if we wanted a large meal. Also, when handing us our drinks through the window, it tilted so much that the cap definitely could've fell off."}
{"text":"Not a bad Wendy's; probably the best fast food joint in a quarter-mile radius."}
{"text":"Why is it when you request No Cheese no one listens? I stated no cheese but I guess they got confused! Please see picture. You just can't get good quality food unless you cook it yourself!"}
{"text":"Not really sure what these negative reviews are about...I have never had a bad situation, bad food, a messed up order, or unfriendly service at this location! I have been coming to this Wendy's location at least once a month for the last 7 years and I know that although their employees change, neither their service nor their friendliness has declined. Wendy's is exactly what it is: fast food. I can tell you that their food is always made fresh and they never forget the simple things like ketchup if I ask for it, the sauces I ask for, the straws, the spoon or the napkin. This place is going to get 5 stars because it is over the top friendly, nice, and clean as compared to every other fast food restaurant. They get the job done: they feed you, fill you up and do it with a smile."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I'm rating Wendy's so low because I love this place. The place itself has pretty good fast food, but DONT use the drive thru if you don't have 20 mins. Tons of people left the drive thru behind me and I spent about 20 mins in the drive thru line at lunch time. It seems like the staff was low and it shouldn't be around lunch time. Either go inside or don't go if you don't have a lot of free time. On the bright side, the staff gave everyone 50% off for waiting so long."}
{"text":"This Wendy's is REALLY SLOW at getting food out. The food is pretty standard for Wendy's, but the service is SUPER SLOW. Also, this tends to be the dinner spot for a lot of the homeless from around the area- so carry some loose change."}
{"text":"Wendy's is pretty solid for good for when you want fast food that won't immediately make you wanna die. This spot is pretty quick and its on par with other Wendy's."}
{"text":"My rule of thumb lately is not to review fast food locations unless they meet following criteria. Service is outstanding or food is amazing. Or my service was horrible etc. I am writing this review in hope management sees this, cause this will freak out alot of people. I ordered some stuff to go. I got burgers and a raspberry tea witch sounded good honestly. The burgers where average bacon was burnt like deep fryer bacon. That wasn't the fries where cold. And the topper I started drinking the drink on the way home witch is like 5 mins even less depending on traffic stop lights sigh -- I will leave those for another story. The drink tasted good however I started noticing hard chunks of something I think maybe mix or something however you can tell there pods with a string attached normally needing to be blended longer so not to leave these is a cup. Espic a white cup that shows up. I dont have food poisoning or any of those signs. However when you see this me being from Phoenix I tend to freak out espic not knowing what I ingested, so I hope management can see this. I do not need any type of reimbursement just letting company know."}
{"text":"Great Wendy's! Bathroom has more than one stall. They forgot my free fristy with my keychain thingy but they always do - no biggie. Make sure you get the gross fast food! It's their specialty! They do a great job at it!"}
{"text":"Wendy's! They have Wendy's things! They have really cheap food or other weird more expensive food that isn't quite delicious. You all know what wendy's is! I am at this wendy's all the dang time! They food is ready pretty quick! Like sometimes almost comically quick, like 15 seconds. The lady there during the day with the brown hair and glasses???? Super nice. Nice employees. Place seems pretty clean. They re-did the bathroom... I think the bathroom even has a purse hook! They have a mottled stone look to the walls and floor so it always looks clean whether it is or not - but it looks clean.   I get value fries and 4 pc spicy nuggets with honey mustard and a water (and a free frosty cause i have a special keychain thang) because I am being cheap as I am saving for something special. Hubs and I split it and it costs $2.12 and we are on our way. I mean, should anyone eat more than half of two value priced items anyway? Wendy's! dont go here! Cook your own food from fresh real ingredients. They did have an advertisement for all-you-can-eat-chilli - not sure what that is about, and currently they have a jalapeno and ghost pepper limited thing goin' on. Frosty was on point when I stopped there on May 11th.   Entryway has no ventilation and is 70 cubit feet of uber hotness. Take note as you walk in and think of me. I'll be the one laughing - you'll be the one sweating. Dont worry... now you are safely inside the restaurant and fries await."}
{"text":"Went to Wendy's tonight for dinner and ordered chili and when I get home it is half filled. So Arizona passes a vote now owners have to pay more per hour then what these people are worth as the cannot even fill a bowl full."}
{"text":"Placed a order last night in drive thru get home order all wrong missing items and this I was over charged but could not tell as they did not give me my recite  I even ask them is everything there he said yes.  This is the second time in a week they have done this to me. I  have been a loyal customer ad this is on the way home from work fir me i guess time to go somewhere else  the owner has some huge issues and no clue what is going on. I would drive by this one save the stress of a wrong order"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this Wendy's for about 2 years and this the first time they messed up my order. I went in today to let them know that I got the wrong order yesterday and they said they can't do anything about it because I did not bring the food back. I work in an inbound call center and can not make outbound calls. I told her that and she said I can't do anything for me. I will never eat at this Wendy's again terrible way to treat a long time customer."}
{"text":"One star because I have to and it was a fast service, however, Stephen was very rude while taking my order via drive-thru, his tone was inappropriate, he lacks customer service skills, he kept repeating; \"is that all?\" After every item I ordered. I asked for a jr bacon cheese burger combo, instead of saying \"we don't offer that in a combo, but will u like to order a drink and fries?\" He said; \"that's not a combo\"! They didn't greet nor thank me at the window when I paid, apparently they don't appreciate theirs jobs and lack customer service training."}
{"text":"The slowest Wendy's I've ever been to!! It took me 35 minutes to get my food. That is absolutely unacceptable for fast food!"}
{"text":"Now I see why they have 2 stars. They need to get the act together. 2nd time I have gone here and gotten a different total from the order screen to the window.  Won't come back to this Wendy's again. Update: Called because when I got home I realized I only had half salads instead of full. Joe provided the proper customer service and is replacing both salads. I wish the manager at the window had provided this."}
{"text":"If you want to sit in a drive through for 20 minutes and be treated terribly by teenagers, this is the place to go  *12/24 update* All of the above remains true. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Pull up to the drive-through and ask for a second. No response, no big deal some people just don't have manners. Pull up to the drive-through window and I'm handed a cup of red fruit punch that has more on the outside of the cup than it does on the inside. That is just what I want red fruit punch all over the tan interior of my car. Asked the girl to wipe the cup off, you would've thought I asked her to shoot her dog. Get my items MINUS 2 things that I paid for. This is the worst Wendy's ever. I would not return."}
{"text":"This Wendy's may look nice but the workers there are rude asf. I asked for the same order as my friend and instead of barbecue sauce I asked for ranch and one of the workers taking my order had a rude remark and said \"oh so it's not the same order?\". After driving away I looked in the bag and they gave me barbecue sauce."}
{"text":"Who doesn't breakfast available on Saturday mornings? Apparently this place. Try to grab breakfast on my way to work this morning. I went to the drive through and another couple parked, an employee was outside told the couple that they weren't open yet. I happen to overhear since he didn't bother to come and tell me. Just FYI people work on Saturday too and they want breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here a few times good food and everything only thing about it is the wierd parking lot it dosnt have street access you have to go down the industrial park to get into it but other than that foods quality Wendy's and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"I go here because it's the closet one... every time I ask for extra honey mustard, the last THREE times we've gone they always forget!! How hard is it to take a few and out the in? I understand that it can sometimes be busy but it hasn't been each time we've gone.. next time PLEASE remember the honey mustard?  I work in food service. Not that hard."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here, but I've also never taken the drive thru.  I thought it was common knowledge that the drivethru everywhere is slower than going inside and ordering, plus you get to save on your gas mileage.  Any way, this place is great with it's little fireplace and TVs and WiFi.  Inside everything is modern and automated which is cool, and I've always received my food very quickly.  I recommend for any fast food place, to go inside and order.  You may also meet a nice person!"}
{"text":"I have only ever ordered the spicy chicken sandwich until today. Do not waist time and order Siracha spicy chicken one. The flavor was great but not spicy at all. Because they add onions and bacon and only put tiny dab of Siracha on it, not spicy. Siracha is also mixed with mayo or something because it is not Orange as it was on my sandwich. Sauce is really red."}
{"text":"Ha!  Same as above... as far as quick and dirty fast food... Wendy's is my go to place.  But like the comment above, I have never had so many incorrect orders as this location.  I've even sent notes to Wendy's corporate about this location.   I find the burgers WAAAAY better at Wendy's vs. McDonald's... but again, the base minimum is that they get the order correct.    C'mon guys... pay attention!"}
{"text":"My mother and I went to the drive through and ordered an asiago ranch grilled chicken sandwich with no tomatoes. I didn't think that was that hard of an order, but they gave me a fried chicken sandwich with no ranch, and tomatoes and an order of cold fries. My mom and I both got food poisoning from the chicken and it made me vomit 6 times. I will never be back here again."}
{"text":"This is the worst wendys probably ever,  it's the only place open on my lunch break and I typically spend 2/3 Of my break here waiting in the drive thru for simple orders and some of the employees are kind of rude and act like it's such an inconvenience to serve me. And they forgot all my sauces today and a spoon for my frosty when I specifically requested all those things"}
{"text":"I haven't had fast food this bad in a long time.   We ordered a $4 combo with burger, french fries, chicken nuggets and a drink. We paid a little extra to replace the regular soda with root beer float. Since we got it to go, I didn't know how bad it was until I opened the bag. The sandwich is small and flat, french fries were either burn up or old. It was completely soak in oil. Chicken nuggets are burn and tasteless. Ok....I was thinking ...well they can't mess up on root beer float. I was wrong. The soda was so flat there was no carbon in it. And the vanilla ice-cream....it is also tasteless.   I will have to say that the staffs at the drive thru was very friendly. Neverthelsss, the quality of food was so bad I will most definitely never come back here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the special chicken Jalpeno fresco Amazing sums it up. The restaurant is clean, and service is also great, located in a small plaza with limited parking."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Wendy's EVER. The drive-thru will take you anywhere between 10-20 minutes. Even if there's only 1 or 2 cars in front of you."}
{"text":"Remember everyone who writes reviews about these places, it is \"fast food\".  That being said I always rate it based on restrooms, cleanliness, employees, and food.  Food should be last because you choose to go to a given fast food chain and you knew what you were getting into.  Alright, enough ranting about fast food reviews... The location is clean and the employees were friendly as well as the food was up to par.  Fast food places have to go out of their way to be a 1 or 5 star review which I don't think I have ever had, but this is above average than most fast food locations."}
{"text":"I will start off this review as I feel like people need to be reminded this is a fast food restaurant.  Only 5 star I would give is if it was exceptional.  My visit was very pleasant and I have no complaints, but we only went in to order and then left.  They had an LCD board that notified patrons the status of their order.  Very cool feature"}
{"text":"I am updating my review simply because of the general manager Brenda and her crew today. We had allready tried the Jalapeño Fresca Chicken Sandwich so we wanted to try it as a double burger. We understand that customization at a chain restaurant might be difficult and it was bit the general manager Brenda stepped in and made it all right. This was way above and beyond expectations so Brenda... you erned  your store an extra star."}
{"text":"It's an airport. This means all food is expensive and slightly lower quality than what you usually want to receive when paying a premium."}
{"text":"This was the worst fast food experience ever.... We struggled to even place our order.... It took forever to get our food... When we did, nothing was right. We were missing 2 sandwiches, 1 order of fries, 2 people that got fries got like 7 or 8 fries in their bag, and the sandwiches we got were made wrong. It was a pain to get it right... and other customers in the store had similar issues."}
{"text":"I decided on a late night to go into the Wendy's drive-thru for a quick burger, I proceeded into the drive-thru at 11:59 with 1 car in front of me already ordering so I waited. I get to the intercom when it was my turn to order and the server tells me they close at 12 and cannot serve me even though I got into the drive-thru before they were closed. This bothered me a little but not enough for me to stop going completely. Tonight i used the drive-thru once again. I ordered a JBC, I payed I got my food and went home. To my surprise I open my bag and find a container that has a burger in the middle surrounded by lettuce. They completely left out the bun. I will never go to Wendy's again."}
{"text":"This is the closest Wendy's to my place of work. So I am here more often than I would like( I have recently found a better location). This location has the normal Wendy's spread we all know and love. But now with adventure tied to it!  The ups? The staff is quick, friendly and present. The lines are never crazy, so if your order is simple it will be correct and fresh.  The downs? The bathroom is never clean. I have seen far to many sketchy characters (including a crying hooker hiding from a cop outside) that I now only really go through the drive through. If your order is off by just a simple \"no onion\" expect to get something completely different than what you ordered. For example : I would love a grilled chicken sandwich with no tomato(receives a Jr bacon cheeseburger)."}
