{"text":"I see from the awards on their website that they used to be good. They also used to be called Brouxnellie's Diner which leads me to believe there was a change of ownership. Sadly they haven' won an award since 2004 and frankly it looks kind of sad still bragging about awards that are over 7 years old.

The service is unbelievably slow, slower then you would even think possible. I ordered a club sandwich and it took 45 mins to be brought to my table. They were dead and the entire place was empty. My gf had to send her food back twice before they finally go it right.

The entire floor and all surfaces in the place seem to have this stickiness to it which is very off putting. Do they clean with actual soap or just warm water?

I know a lot of people in town think this place is good but personally I think they used to be good and people are just giving them too much credit."}
{"text":"Cockroach invested!!! So nasty. My chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was green! Don't waste your money, time or health here!"}
{"text":"Went here looking for a new favorite brunch restaurant, and walked away knowing we would probably never return.  

I mean, okay.  I get the whole laid back diner atmosphere, and most of the time, I dig it.  This place really does the whole cutesy diner thing well, and the atmosphere is sunny and open and kinda great.  

With that said, being a casual diner on a Sunday mid-morning for brunch doesn't mean you can ignore your table.  Which our server did, for long stretches of time, particularly the times that are the most important: when we want to order our food.  We waited, and waited, and waited, and looked around, and waited, and she was nowhere.  So that sucked.  

The food was...food.  My husband ordered the corned beef hash, and it was straight from a can.  I mean, we know what Hormel corned beef hash looks like when we see it, and that's exactly what came slopped onto his plate.  He asked for his eggs poached, and they were WAY overdone - rock hard yolks and rubbery whites.  Gross.  Plus, the plate was TINY.  It didn't even look like they gave him the whole can of hash.

I ordered the eggs and hash browns and both were under-seasoned and mostly unappetizing.  The eggs looked like...remember when you used to go to church potlucks when you were little and there would be a giant catering dish full of rubbery scrambled eggs that were yellow-ish and looked like something that might've, at one time, been an egg?  That's what showed up on my plate.  Yech.  

I will say, their pancakes were good.  I think if you're planning to go there for brunch, you should probably stick to the pancake side of the menu (which, by the way, is just a bunch of crumpled pieces of paper stapled together, but whatever).  My friend got the bananas foster pancakes and they were amazing. 

So, I dunno.  I guess you can try this place out if you're not that interested in good service or great food and all you're looking for is lunch or something.  They do have six different kinds of hot sauce on the table, so there was that."}
{"text":"This is a fun, small-town diner with a good selection and enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been so disappointed to see the service levels at DeBroux's go down each time we visit, while the prices continue to go up. The last time we were there, it took forever to get our food, my daughter's meal was forgotten, and everything was meh at best. There are better places in Oregon to eat, and we'll be going there from now on."}
{"text":"DeBroux's is your average diner type food. People seem to give it a trashing in reviews but I have never had a bad experience there. The shakes are particularly good. Try the butterscotch shake, it's actually more of a caramel shake despite its name. The sweet potato fries are also good. Overall it's nice place to go when your looking for a burger."}
{"text":"Our company just ordered 16 box lunches from Greg at DeBroux's and had them delivered.  Greg came when he said he would be here and everything was delicious.  The attention to detail with the box lunches was great - each box labeled with our names, napkin and utensils in each one, and everything packaged really nicely.  The sandwiches and fruit are definitely fresh.  We definitely want to order from here again!  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We keep giving this place a chance, and finally, they have worn us out. We went there on a Saturday night with our toddler.  The tables were 3/4 full, and I swear every single person who was working there was under the age of 17.  No disrespect to teenagers, but there was no visible manager or person running the place and you could definitely tell.  It took A FULL HOUR to get food on our table, and we ordered simple things.  Our toddler was going nuts by the time the food got there.

No matter what you order, it is sub par food.  Horrible service.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Good food and large menu selection.  Lots to choose from.  Friendly service, but always very, very slow."}
{"text":"Hash browns are cooked with awful tasting oil (maybe corn oil?).  Service is very slow.  Omelet had no taste at all.  Prices are way too high, but then again, even if it was free I would not return."}
{"text":"Wow, back in the days they used to have great food and great service. My favorite was the Cajun Chicken Sandwich, it was the best!! Lately the quality of food sucks and service is even worse!! A while back I use to see the owner help out and involved with customers. I just ordered a Cajun Chicken sandwich and it taste terrible, nothing like the sandwiches they use to make.. Sorry guys, but I'm surprised you guys have survived that long. Either go back to the old ways and produce quality and tasteful food or you might not have clients for long.. I used to love your place and thought that you had the best chicken sandwiches in this state. Sorry to see such good talent degrade itself:(:("}
{"text":"Used to be Brouxnellies.  Wasn't good then and not now.  We thought we would give them another chance since the ownership change and nothing had improved.  The last two times we went there we had the server completely forget to submit our order and couldn't even  apologize and the second time half our order never arrived.  

The main problem is that the owner is not there and service is left up the the teenage servers."}
{"text":"I seriously can't understand how this place is still in business. Food safety is nonexistent--talk to some former employees about the disgusting basement and cockroach infestation. 
Every six months I get lazy about making breakfast and would think, \"Oh, it couldn't be as bad as I remember.\" Every time, it really is that bad. 
Try some different businesses in Oregon/Brooklyn area for breakfast."}
{"text":"If you like good food this place works.  Service is fast and freindly.  The malts are awsome."}
{"text":"We went here for Restaurant week and were very disappointed. The menu descriptions were fabulous, but the food was sub-par and not worth $25. 

The chicken was served in a gummy gravy sauce with fresh-from-the-freezer roasted potatoes and a not-so-fresh Caesar salad). The molten cake was the highlight of a meal that probably should have cost only $20 or less. The pork dinner my BF had wasn't much better -- chewy pork served with some soggy waffles and breaded chicken wings that came off the Sysco truck and were covered in BBQ sauce. I felt like we were up-charged for the dinner because it was Restaurant Week, especially compared to what entrees normally cost at the restaurant. We left $70 poorer (we also had a drink each and left a good tip -- it wasn't the waitress's fault the food was bad) and unsatisfied. If we are in Oregon again for dinner, we'll try the Senor Peppers next door -- the place was packed. The diner was not. That should have been our first clue."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, food was delivered fast, fresh & hot.   Staff (Especially our server Kayla) was friendly and attentive.  Omelets had fresh ingredients and were very flavorful.   Prices were the only drawback ... We will definatley return to try other menu selections.

Thank you!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon about 2pm I made plans to attempt what is to my knowledge, Oregon's only formal eating contest of any kind. Its known as the Debroux Man vs Food Challenge. I called ahead to let them know I would be coming so it would be ready when I got seated. My brother tapped the whole thing so I had proof of the feat if I did in fact finish in the 20 minute time limit. All in all after what had been over 2 years since coming back home to Oregon, WI due to my work in Missouri, this was a pleasent and filling welcome home at venue of which has been in operations since I started high school many moons ago. If your looking for classic American/Wisconsin diner food then this is your go to location for sure. See this video clip below for the real deal yourself.

{"text":"This restaurant catered a breakfast I attended a while back and I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  Thanks DeBroux's.  I plan to stop by and eat in sometime soon.  We shall see how well you do on the \"in house\" test."}
{"text":"Someone told us we couldn't miss this place on a trip to Madison. I beg to differ. Food was average at best. I was hoping for a great slice of pie but there were only 4 varieties available by the slice and they looked like they were purchased from a grocery store. 

Service was good and staff was friendly but the food won't allow me a return visit."}
{"text":"On my first visit here two years ago I gave them 5 Stars (under the name Brouxnellies Diner & Catering - it's still there to read) and have been wanting to come back ever since.

What a disappointment!

We went far out of our way to go here. I was craving for the lamb burger I had last time and was talking the place up about how they have a local meat purveyor and so on. 

When we walked in it looked like a high school cafeteria in terms of cleanliness with unbused tables and a messy counter (you can easily see behind the counter when you walk in - bad idea). We asked to sit outside and was assisted by a very helpful host. She brought menus and drinks and kept assuring us the waitress would be right along. She never arrived.

I looked at the menu and noticed a couple of things: First, no lamb burger. But, that happens. Next, the menu has little stickers all over with price changes and additional charges for things like bacon on the burger. Very amateurish. All the staff looked like high schoolers, not an adult to be found. This left me wondering what is going on in the kitchen, especially after a less than impressive dining area. Finally, the prices for some of the burgers were around $10.00 (give or take with additional charges). I would rather go to Culver's and spend half that if they don't have anything to differentiate themselves with.

So, with non-existant service, a fast food restaurant staffing level, limited menu and prices that don't match the value, we left without ordering and regretted that we did not trust the other Yelp reviews.

Sad."}
{"text":"Tonight our food was GREAT! Baked fish came in 3 neat pieces, wrapprd in spices and baked to perfection. This came with coleslaw and a side order which I chose salad. The greens were fresh. My husbands southwestern omelet was always very good. service was great tonight!"}
{"text":"We have been to DeBroux's a few times now and each time is better than the last! Small town feel with a big time taste, the food is delicious and the service is great. No waiting to be seated and friendly and attentive service. My boyfriend wanted something he thought was on the Menu, but it wasn't and instead of saying \"no we don't have that\" he explained to the Server what we wanted and the Owner actually cooked up his version of it himself  for him and it was awesome!!!  I highly recommend eating at DeBroux's, you won't be disappointed."}
