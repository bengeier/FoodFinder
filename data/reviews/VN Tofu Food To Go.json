{"text":"This review is based on their fried tofu and not their business. I bought their fried tofu in Super G mart. It is a big Asian grocery store and I came upon VN Tofu ready made fried tofu in the produce section. It is very good and comes in a take out container. It's convenient for me to pick it up this way instead. I bet their tofu is even better freshly made and ordered at their location."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  Any time I see the expansion of the Vietnamese food community, my stomach leaps a little.  This place is a tofu place that makes tofu dishes to go.  On a weekday lunch, I picked up tofu spring rolls and tofu pudding.  You order at the register and the food is made in the back.

The tofu spring rolls lacked a little pizzazz.  It had iceberg lettuce, mint, bean sprouts, vermicelli noodles and was served with hoison peanut butter sauce.  The spring rolls could be spruced up with some picked carrots and/or diakon, garlic chives, or cucumber.  Vegetarian doesn't have to be so bland. 

On to what I really loved about this place.  I love the tofu pudding.  I hadn't had any in soooo long.  Don't be fooled.  This is a real treat, don't be turned off by the idea of a tofu dessert.  The texture is creamy and the ginger sugary syrup is divine (sweet and spicy - like me).  I would come back just to have this again. 

Just be warned, there were two of us there on a weekday and it took a good 15 minutes to get my food, not like the Socal food to go places."}
{"text":"Ok, I'm hoping to upgrade this review to a 5 star soon but for now... just wasn't that impressed.

The good:

-Everything is vegan which is win win win in my world. 
-They make their tofu on site. 
-While I waited for my order there were several non-vegs coming in to check out the place.See people, tofu isn't scary. 
-Prices are low for huge portions, really two meals in one plate
-Pretty quick services


The meh:
-The store front needs some help. There was only a card table with some random magazines, a counter and a cooler in the front. It's just not very inviting. 
-The food was just ok. Not great. I ordered the lemongras tofu with pepper based on their recommendations and it was just lacking something. But, one dish isn't really fair to a place so I'll be going back. 
-Hours. I first tried to go on a Thursday and they're closed. It's also hard for me to make it over their way afterwork before they close during the week. 

All in all, I hope it improves a bit, prices stay low and we start a tofu revolution in Charlotte!"}
