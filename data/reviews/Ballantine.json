{"text":"Ballentine was a great Happy Hour location until recently: now one has to ask for the beers on HH, one has to ask for the HH menu, one has to specify s/he is ordering from the HH menu...it gets to be a lot of work to save a buck, and.the food is not worth the hassle.  Waitresses with attitude who are unwilling to offer a current/accurate beer list?  No, we won't be going back, and we were Wednesday night regulars. Lots of other good choices on the block. 

The 1899 just in back (same owners) is a better choice: laid back atmosphere, good juke box, and no attitude."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Ohio. Dry aged Ribeye is outstanding. Ask for chef special and let them dazzle you with flavors. This is a can't miss place in Ohio"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a few craft beers on St. Patricks day and couldn't believe how busy this place was considering the two Irish pubs across the street.  The bar was busy but i managed to grab a seat.  I was quickly greeted by the guy bartender who gave me a few samples of their beers that I havent tried before. He was knowledgeable about the breweries and the beers. The girl bartender was very pleasant also. She also recommended some of the food to try.

While I was there Irish Bagpipers came through and played some of their music.  Was slightly loud, but understandable considering the small size of the bar and the large amount of members of the band.  Food and drinks were great.  The other guests were all friendly as well.  Great environment!

I will return to this place again.  It was a great experience and will recommend to my friends and colleagues."}
{"text":"I went to Ballantine for the first time in years.  Most of the reviews here seem to be incredibly positive and fairly formulaic... I am not sure if they genuine as they seem too similar in tone and wording.  

I got off work early and wanted to try happy hour food before I went home.  I got to Ballantine at about 4:30 p.m. and sat at the bar.  There were a few people in the restaurant but the staff was clearly getting geared up for the night because no one ever greeted me even though about 5 workers walked by me on both sides of the bar many times.

After about 10 minutes, the bartender asked if I needed a menu, which I did. I heard the happy hour food was  good and reasonably priced, so i decided to have the 'Plain Burger' ($5.00) cooked medium-well and a soft drink ($2.75). I don't drink very often and was not in the mood for beer even though they have quite a selection on tap.  The bartender asked if I wanted fries or a salad for $2 more. I opted for the fries.

It took them quite a while to get the food out as they were mostly bustling around to continue getting the bar and kitchen ready for an apparently busy night to come.  The burger was cooked perfectly and tasted fine (about 5 out of 10....nothing special).  The fries were very hot and fine too.  

My only real problem was that the service was close to non-existent.  No one ever asked me if the meal was ok or if I wanted anything else.  The busy bartender walked back and forth many times and ignored my empty glass.  I tried to get her attention but she was always in the middle of talking or doing something without looking at the customers at the bar.  I did not really feel in the mood to demand basic attention and just wanted to get out of there.

Finally, I asked for the check and the bartender asked if I wanted a refill or anything else to eat.  I declined, paid, and left.

SUMMARY:  

1.  The happy hour food is ok, not great.  I saw entrees from the main menu and they did look amazing.

2.  Service during happy hour is terrible.

3.  Although there were many WIFI connections, none of them worked.  The bartender said only one of them works, and that one connection was \"resetting\".  I was there for an hour and there was no WIFI.

4.  With so many other options for food in Willoughby and Mentor, I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a tough one...  I really like the feel of this place overall, great set up. The open kitchen, large bar, and tables by the open front windows were really nice. 

Food: 
Fianc√©e had the Pat Burger with fries. Cooked medium rare as ordered. Very flavorful, but a bit overpriced for what you got. Only complaint on this was the bun. A little steam or quick hit on the grill would have done wonders for the bun. Clearly store bought and dry.  Would have been really good had the bun not thrown it all off. 

I had the 14 oz grass fed strip with asparagus side and gorgonzola cream sauce. The sauce was excellent; highlight of the meal. I would liked it to have been incorporated into the dish, but it instead was served on the side. The asparagus was very bland. I think it was steamed and put on the plate. No seasoning at all. 

The steak was a very nice cut of meat with good quality. The inside was cooked perfectly medium rare, but it was lacking any kind of crust on the outside. The chef also neglected to render the large area of fat found on all strip steaks. What a mistake this was.  This area of the steak remains inedible  when you neglect to hit it with a high heat source. Not only would it have helped with the presentation and appearance of the meat, but it would have done wonders for the flavor as well.  Pretty disappointed with my entree.

Drinks: Good beer selection. All drafts $5
I wanted to end with a little after dinner drink. Two sippers of Grand Marnier. The bartender carefully free poured what looked like under 1 oz each. The kicker; $8.50 a piece. $17 for 2 oz of Grand Marnier? 

This place really has a great thought, however, there was a serious lack of execution. Maybe it was because it was a Sunday night? I will consider coming back to try happy hour, but I don't think I will be coming in to spend my money on dinner anytime soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the scallops. For $28 I got 3 medium/small scallops over a bed of salty rice. Scallops were crispy and chewy. Others got the salmon which was a small portion, shrimp linguine was in a small little bowl and the French fries were crispy and burned. For the price of this place $$$$ you barely get any food at subpar taste. Wouldn't come back and the kitchen was slow."}
{"text":"\"Great craft brew selection. Wood fired pizza. Nice facility and awesome service. I go out of my way to visit here. 5 stars aren't really enough!!\""}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection, cool vibes, you could get lost here for hours and solve all of the worlds problems.  $5 dollar drafts allows you to sample a variety of drinks without breaking the budget."}
{"text":"First visit on 12/05/2015.....I couldn't resist hearing the music so I decided to check it out....nice spot to bring your friends and have a good time, dance, and of course drink!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love Ballantine. Here's why; I can get some amazing sushi, and a lovely (affordable) glass of wine. My husband can get a fantastic burger, and an interesting beer on draught. This is my go-to, local pub. I gave it 4 stars because the typical Willoughby crowd is usually there."}
{"text":"We went here for the 2nd time a few months ago and it was a different experience the the 1st time. They do not try to accommodate their customers. We had a coupon that we wanted to use, but they put so many stipulations on it when we asked about it, and even when the waitress gave a frustrated look and went to the manager, we were still told we could not use it. All of this for $6 - I can find someplace to eat that knows customer service,"}
{"text":"Really good food. Service a little slow but not too bad."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and always wonder why I bother. The food wavers between average and poor and the cocktails are weak and generally uninteresting.  More of a hangout for the trendy crowd than a real food experience."}
{"text":"Nice interior.  Some of the tables were pushed back so people could dance because there was a DJ.  The DJ was fairly good and almost everyone there was dancing.  Got drinks right away because they weren't very busy.  Bartender was friendly and drinks were good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and both times were good experiences. Great steak and a very good pizza. Full bar with lots of beer choices. Good service and cozy/classy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Hit on by the manager very unprofessional the restroom was filthy and had clogged toilets.. had to have my drink replaced twice because the glass was so dirty!!! My food was very very salty not edible wow yuck.. don't hit on your patrons!!! Just trying to have a nice evening with my friends for his bday and felt very uncomfortable.. never going back!!! So disappointed! Do not go here.. don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Um, this is a place I will not be returning to. I went here last Friday night and was super excited to try this place out. I had heard great things about their beer selection etc. To start off, I feel like the look and feel of this place masks the true quality of it - and not in a good way. We were seated immediately but it took a few minutes for our server to get to us. I have to say, their beer list is quite impressive. I had the Breckinridge Vanilla Porter and \"B\" had the Arrogant Bastard Ale. Both were tasty. It took about a good 15 minutes for them to get to our table though. 
For food, I had the Penne Pesto with grilled chicken and \"B\" ordered the Delmonico steak. They were $16 and $30 respectively. Now, for a $16 plate of pasta, I don't expect it to be swimming in oil and have barely any pesto flavor and a couple pieces of rubbery chicken thrown on top. I didn't end up finishing it. \"B\" said his steak was great but the side was a big hunk of broccoli in a bowl with no seasoning whatsoever and soggy fries. I would also expect for a $30 plate, you would get some excellent seasoning and some damn good sides but I guess not. We did have a lot of trouble getting our server's attention while cashing out as well. After realizing that her area of tables wasn't that large, I couldn't understand why. 
I also feel their menu is very disjointed, small, and not diverse at all. In saying that, I mean their sandwich section consists of one burger and a chicken sandwich; their entrees consist of 2 steak dishes, about 3 chicken dishes and 2 pasta dishes, and I think they had 2 entree salads. 
We were hugely disappointed with Ballantine just because our expectations were so high. I definitely expected more when spending that much money."}
{"text":"I wasn't there for the alcohol, but my friend had a Margarita that he enjoyed.  They had a wide selection of fancy beer, that might interest some. I was a starving Gluten Free Veggie and there because it was the most interesting sounding restaurant that popped up on my Gluten Free Yelp search.

Our server was polite, careful, and informative.  I had their Gluten Free pasta dish.  It was delicious.  Penne pasta, a number of sliced veggies, including sun dried tomatoes in a tasty cream sauce.

My companion had sushi that he reported was the best he'd had since leaving California. He let the server choose for him and had a happy surprise with the crab/wasabi rolls that he wouldn't have picked for himself but reported was his favorite of all the choices.

Desert was a happy surprise.  There were two choices in the Gluten Free category.  I went with the Triple Chocolate.  I was good but not fantastic.

The only real disappointment of the meal was the coffee.  They didn't have espresso so I went with regular coffee with cream.  The cream they provided was sweetened. It tasted almost like those fake creamer that try to make your coffee taste like an Irish coffee, but only manage to make it taste strange.   

As others have reported it was a bit pricy, but the food was good and I find that most places that carry Gluten Free food usually are.

We were there in mid-afternoon.  There were TV's showing the Ohio State football game, but they were not blasting and it was easy to ignore them and carry on a conversation  If you are there for the game and some pub grub, sit in the bar and I am sure you will have a good time."}
{"text":"It's an okay place - it is hard to get any service or move around when they are even slightly busy.  There is always a varied crowd in Ballantine at night- it is either really sophisticated young(ish) adults, Snookie/Paulie D's or young people covered in tattoos and piercings (for Tuesday's indie rock night).  I can go with either crowd, generally, but this place just seems so... cold? 

The vegetarian pizza and burgers are pretty good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have them again.  The back patio (shared with 1899) is a good place to meet new people and smoke a cigarette in a nice environment (as opposed to the front sidewalk on the corner)."}
{"text":"Haven't had the chance to dine here yet, but I'll tell you what - Ballantine has the best bathrooms in Downtown Willoughby. 

Stone walls
Separated urinals
Stand alone stall
Two sinks
Paper towels - stocked
Soap - stocked

There's even a shelf in front of the urinals to put your drink!
10/10 would pee here again."}
{"text":"Went to ballentine for dinner the other night, I've been reading the reviews and i feel with reading some of these and seeing you need to go to other restaurants is false. The staff is great the food is great and the manager couldn't have been more helpful. I would definitely recommend it and go back. They seem to have a positive vibe going on in the restaurant. I will be returning"}
{"text":"I went here for a girls night out a few months ago, and it was OK. Our waitress was really good, but the place was super loud so it was hard to hear her at times. I ordered the pretzel chicken, which, in my mind, was perfect because we were gonna be drinking that night - so a good source of protein with a side of mashed potatoes. Overall, it was good, but the chicken was kind of dry - which was a turn off. The table also ordered mixed drinks, which were delicious. Later on the night, we came back for the DJ and dancing - and that was a ton of fun."}
{"text":"This is my favortie restaurant in downtown willoughby. The best food, awesome drink selection, but the reason I did not vote 5 stars is because of the service. I enjoy a few of the servers in the establishment, but there is some very cocky people that work here. I have noticed that at some times during the evening of a bar/restaurant, a worker may feel the need to act in a manner to set the standards. Yet, the saying still goes no matter what time of the day it is, it's all about the customer. The best thing this place has going for it, is the beer and food, besides that I dislike."}
{"text":"Well - I really never was able to taste the food. They took my reservation for Christmas Eve dinner and called me today - 12/13 and said \"I'm sorry but we're actually closed.\" OK that's great, but now it's too late to get reservations anywhere. I tried a couple of days ago because I wanted to add more people and it said they were booked. Thank you very much for leaving me STUCK!!!! It took you 2 weeks to figure out you were closed on Christmas Eve. Great organization. I wouldn't even want to try your food if you are that disorganized."}
{"text":"OK, the parking in the region isn't great, but the food here is amazing. I HIGHLY suggest you try the sushi nacho's. They are truly awesome. The drink menu is solid and almost all of the other food offerings appear to be pretty amazing as well. Do yourself a favor and try this place."}
{"text":"$2 for a glass of ice is a little ridiculous! 

Had the Pat LaFrieda burger, it was good but really greasy. Wife had the Pad Thai, it was mediocre at best. 

The atmosphere is super trendy and makes for a great vibe. Service was great, very aware and attentive. 

All and all, nothing special...good bar good at best...pricey!"}
{"text":"I stopped in because I live just down the street near Lakeshore Blvd.  I just wanted to get something to eat because I was starved. The menu was quite expensive so I figured I would go with the $10 hamburger. What a mistake. It was at best a 4 ounce burger that was ruined by loading it with basil and what looked like a salad covered with what looked like Thousand Island dressing.  All I can say is yuk.  The fries were solid grease and also loaded with basil or whatever the herbs were that the burger was covered with.  To say it was awful would be a compliment. I thought I could eat anything. I ate it because I was starved and did not want to waste $10 and go somewhere else.  I should have. The stench of the spice that did not belong on or near a burger permeated me and my clothes. It was terrible. Even the soda was totally flat. The waiter reluctantly took it off my check. Not his fault. He was as nice as could be. I did not complain to him about the horrible food because I just couldnt do it.  If I ever smell that smell that permeated everything again I know I will puke.  Just writing this makes me ill. 
     It is difficult to believe any business would sell something as terrible as this. If it was just plain without the horrible grease laden weirdly spiced fries it would have been edible.  This was not. One of the most horrible meals I have had in 68 years of being alive and I have had some bad ones. If they want to sell burgers stick to normal ones and change the grease in the deep fryer every so often. Usually bars have decent food. Not this one. Do not eat here. You will not like it. I will limit my comments to the burgers. I did not try the other stuff and do not plan to."}
{"text":"Ballantine reminds me of something that could make a go on East 4th. Instead, its located in what Stefanie C. calls DTW (which I am using from now on!). Ballantine is sophisticated and casual at the same time. Its menu is upscale pub grub (a Cleveland theme, for sure) which they have named \"gastropub.\" To be honest, and I always am, I am not sure their menu really lives up to the gastropub category. I think the bar is set pretty high when it comes to pub grub in this town, and I don't know that Ballantine has that inventive of a menu. Their menu is still great, even if it isn't inventive. Not everything needs to be inventive. 

Most important thing to know: Beer. They have around 50 on tap and almost 100 on their list. Now, that is impressive. 

DTW is the \"going out spot\" for all the young folks in Lake County and surrounding areas, so the bar will fill as the night goes on."}
{"text":"Finally getting around to reviewing tho place.  Let me put bluntly. Dining here was one of the few times I seriously wondered how unacceptable it would be to lick my plate. Parking in downtown Willoby sucks, but the food makes you forget about parking. It was one of the first real dinners my wife and I got to enjoy without having to rush home for our son. My sis was watching him overnight.
    So we try this place on a whim. No prior knowledge of it at all. It just looked cool.
I love it when things work out well. This place was cool, lots of craft beers. I had their cranberry BBQ ribs with fresh rosemary fries.... I don't even know how to describe it. Maybe plate licking worthy? Service was great dinner was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"You know what?  We had a great dinner here.  The Firecracker sushi roll was delicious, super fresh and packed with flavor.  I loved it.  The pierogies and sausage with caramelized onions were awesome.  The wedge salad wasn't good.  I like spicy food but the dressing was overly spicy for no reason and without a mention of it on the menu. My hubby doesn't do spicy, and so he didn't like it at all.  Everyone else at the table ordered steaks and said they were good. Service was good.  I have wanted to go here for a while and I am glad we finally went. We will definitely go back. We were still talking about it the next day."}
{"text":"Ballantine, you do not impress me. It had been about 2 years since I gave you a try.. You added more Asian items... But took away the sauce with your fries.  I ordered the sticky ribs, but the plum sauce was overpowering. Your only redeeming quality was the Rosemary and garlic laden fries. Service was slow, somewhat inattentive and the wine list was subpar. You're going to have to do more to lure me back to your bar."}
{"text":"The restaraunt was nice, clean, and comfortable.  

The service was a bit of a let down, but I'm pretty sure it was just our waitress Natalee.  The rest of the staff was on top of things and they paid more attention to us and that's the only thing that saved the 3rd star.  

First, we ordered drinks.  I specifically asked for a lemon slice with my HefeWeizen beer (It's a German thing).  Drinks came, no lemon.  I asked again when we ordered an appetizer and dinner.  She walked away, placed the order, then disappeared.  I finally went to the bar and got the lemon myself.  When she arrived with the appetizers, she saw the saucer of lemon slices and said, \"Oh, good, you got some!\" 

We started out with the crab cakes.  Very tasty.  Nice citrus sauce and plenty of chunky crab.  

For the entree we both had the seafood arrabiata.  Lobster, shrimp and scallops in a spicy red pepper sauce served on linguine.  Very good.  

Throughout the dinner, we placed the empy plates, empty glasses (hoping to get another drink) at the end of the table so it was very easy to see.  She would just blow right by and never stopped to ask us if we needed anything.  We had to flag her down to get service.

If it wasn't for the waitress forgetting just about everything we asked for, this would have been a 4 star dinner."}
{"text":"We went late on a Tuesday night to take advantage of their website-advertised 9 to 11pm Happy Hour.  We were OK with a later dinner since we had some errands to do beforehand, etc.

We get seated and the waiter looks at us like we have 4 heads when we ask if it is Happy Hour (assuming that it is) at 9:02pm.  The answer, \"no, that only goes til 6\".  Bummer.  Then I notify him the website says 4 to 6 AND 9 to 11.  He thinks that is odd since they close at 10.  

We order a few beers and he takes our order.  I see on the printed menu their two Happy Hour times (M-F) as 4 to 6pm and 9 to 11pm.  Response?  \"Yeah I guess that's an error, we're only open til 10.\"

That put a damper on the experience.  We got two appetizers--a sushi order and the chicken dip-both excellent.  Our entrees were both burgers--also quite good.  The food and beers save this rating to 3-stars.  I don't know if we'll be back--we might but Ballantine got knocked down a few notches, and it seems to be a trend from others feedback as well.  Not sure if it's new management or what.

Come on guys, update your website and menu."}
{"text":"I have been goin to Ballantine for many years now and I have to say it is one of my favorite restaurants in the area. One of my favorite dishes that they had was the pretzel chicken, it was amazing. I had come back a month later and the menu had changed. They do have an entree that is delicious and fought my eye, it was the chicken cutlet(as close to my pretzel chicken as I am going to get). Another reason why I Love Ballantine is because it opens me up to try new beers, I believe they are the only restaurant in the downtown Willoughby area that has amazing rotating craft draft beers, not to mention they have the IPAlooza every February with the whole month filled with delicious craft beers just for the members of the ipalooza(and pretty sweet hoodies). I have nothing but an amazing experience when I go their from the staff to the food down to the beers. If anyone is looking for great tasting beer and food Ballantine is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night around 7:00, I was greeted by the most rude condescending hostess My wife and I have ever encountered. After being dismissed, we left and had a great meal at BJ's by mall. I doubt we will ever return. Even though we are Willoughby residents and dine out several times a week."}
{"text":"Ballantine is my go-to place when I want good wine, a good meal and fantastic service. And it's even a place my 17-year-old daughter loves (and she's pretty picky). 
My personal favorites -- the salmon, roasted brussel sprouts, the scallop appetizer over fresh corn and bacon bits (YUM!) 
Hubby, who makes pizza for a living, can be caught ordering their pizza and he loves it. 
However, I would advise against getting the bruschetta unless you're looking for a huge hunk of bread. 
Tuesdays are half off bottles of wine - and it's a great deal.
I love sitting by the giant open windows in the summer -- almost like eating outside. 
Interesting fact, if you don't finish a bottle wine, you can have the wait staff cork it and you can take it home with you. 
I usually make a reservation on Fridays and Saturdays. 
Sad thing: They're not open for lunch. :("}
{"text":"Lots of sushi options and discount night was Monday! I had a burger too that was good but nothing too extra special tasting, though I beleive they offer grass fed beef (I had a turkey burger). Appetizer menu is what I would've liked to try. Kinda a dark feel to the place good for a date probably not to celebrate a family birthday. Lots of drink options."}
{"text":"Went there for the 1st time a few months back.  Their prices are a little high but the food presentation was nice and the taste was even better! The chocolate martini was decadent! seating was close to your neighbor.  If you are over 250 pounds you will feel squished as my company had expressed that evening.  They have a really cool feature in that bar.....The front windows come out or slide open!! So, if you sit by the windows near the sidewalk you have this bistro outdoor zzz feel.  Unique! I would choose to eat there if I was going to be bar hopping in Willoughby that night."}
{"text":"Everything I had here food wise was great. Staff was great as well. Its just a bit of a drive for me being in Cleveland. I wish either I was closer or the place was closer itself. Seems like they have a lot of beers for all you drunk bozos."}
{"text":"Stopped in this past weekend grabbed a seat at the bar and enjoyed a few very yummy appetizers. The staff was prompt and the food was good. So if your ever in DTW check them out."}
{"text":"After checking out the Willoughby area, we decided this place had a very nice feel to it looking from the outside and decided to check it out. It's seems like one of those gastro-pub place with good food and good beer selection. 
Unfortunately, the food was not up to our standard. The service was also really slow that day. We waited for about 15 minutes after we ordered for their bread to come out. And then another maybe 25 minutes for the food to come out. This is probably one of the slowest service.

My boyfriend ordered their aged steak and I ordered a pesto penne. The steak was A-OK (using the Yelp word). Nothing was wrong with it but it definitely wasn't outstanding. The cost of the steak wasn't any cheaper than a nice restaurant. My pesto penne was the same - it had some good ingredients, but they did not do a good job with the sauce. A pesto sauce should not be like water. As a result, a lot of the pesto flavor didn't get into the penne, so it tasted somewhat bland.

When it comes to paying, our waitress was also taking forever. I understand they're busy, but that's still quite slow for a busy restaurant. Highly doubt I'll go back again unless they have some cheap special."}
{"text":"This bar is a great place to meet up with friends.  The drinks are a bit more pricey than other bars around, but generally you can get a table or bar stool so you don't have to stand around.  The bartenders are friendly and it does not generally take long to get a drink.  I would definately recommend it to anyone looking for a chill place to hang out in downtown Willoughby.

I have only eaten food there once, and it was a pizza.  It was delicious and for the price, not a bad size."}
{"text":"Ballantine is probably the best bar in the DTW. They will actually serve you, for one, and they have some really great things to eat and drink. 

The \"shroom\" pizza I had was very tasty. I wouldn't order that if you're planning on making out with anyone later on though, very garlicky. 

There are so many great beer choices here that it's actually a bit hard to choose. So you should probably try all of them. 

The bartenders are probably not the best. Mostly because they don't know a friggin' thing about any of the glorious beer they are serving. I think they should! I know that I got a completely different beer than the one I actually ordered at least once... but that was okay because it was good and not anything produced by Miller or Budweiser. But they get points for actually being attentive and realizing that we were there. I'm sad that I missed the whipped cream show. Bummer. 

Something worth noting, I noticed that they offer more than one gluten-free beer option. 

Really, the only bad thing about Ballantine is that as the hour grows later, the clientele gets more Jersey Shore. And the music gets worse. My sex was not on fire. 

So yeah, Ballantine is way cooler in the early evening and you should probably drink up before Snookie and her crew show up."}
{"text":"Hours of trying to shop for living room furniture with the husband, right before we came here, had us believing one thing: we're just opposites who attract- what he hates, I love and what I hate, he loves.. This was until we tasted the pasta here- worst pasta ever. The terribleness of the pasta brought us together again lol... so I really can't be too disappointed with them after all...

Ordered the \"Glut\"ton's pasta: pasta, Zuchini, Squash, Tomato, asparagus, Goat cheese cream, arugula-pesto drizzle...mmm.... the idea of it had me anticipating deliciousness...I mean, it's pasta, and it's goat cheese... Impossible to screw that up right? Wrong! The pasta was literally uncooked when it came. They took it back graciously when I complained and brought it back: still chewy the second time around ( didn't have the heart to send it back again...). The goat cheese sauce was average at best...To be fair they did not charge us for the pasta... and the cocktails were good. Really good. Hubby ordered Lobster stuffed Salmon ( weekly special) which was delectable as well....  Oh and the Bacon Wrapped Scallops... Amazing.

Service:polite, not overtly friendly. I feel that the staff handled the Saturday night bustle really well.

Ambiance: very Park Slope-y. Busy, loud, and crowded. Perfect if you are out with friends or a casual date. I wouldn't go here for a special occasion dinner.

Also, they DO NOT DO LUNCH anymore. Had driven all the way here a week ago, only to find upside down chairs on tables...."}
{"text":"The wings are stellar, but they ran out last time we were there! No matter. The onion rings are light and crispy like tempura. Try them with a side of wing sauce and some Tabasco. The BBQ burger was not bad, but you can't expect much buying pulled pork in the north country. Go with the pizza and some craft beers. The crowd? Real good."}
{"text":"My husband and I were doing some errands and decided to go out for dinner in Willoughby, knowing there were lots of options ... But, having no reservations at 8:00 on a Saturday night, those options narrowed down - fast!

We avoided the line up waiting for valet in the WBC lot and finally found a space in one of the free public lots. We decided to check out Ballentines - it looked like a more upscale pub with happy people in the seats near the windows. We were told it would be 25 - 30 min for a table, so we put our name in and grabbed a spot standing at the bar. The bartender was the best part of the evening - quick, friendly and helpful - it was too loud to hear her name (and I asked), but she was great.

After about 20 minutes, we were able to get seats at the bar, and no more than 5 minutes later, one of the hosts came to suggest that we eat at the bar since it would be at least another 30 minutes for a table ... since we were getting great service and enjoying his WBC Gutterpup and my Lambic, we decided to stay put. He offered nothing - no thanks, no free app - nothing - just ambled away to scratch one future customer off his list. Our heroine bartender apologized, ran the specials list and gave us a fee round. Again, perfect service.

By now, the evening bar crowd was starting to fill in and patrons were reaching - and yelling - over us to get drink service. So we passed on apps and definitely ruled out the 30 dollar steaks - so we tried the wood fired pizza. We could see the oven and everything looked primed for a great crispy 'za ... Not even close! The margharita pizza came wallowing in gooey, oily standard pizza mozzarella cheese with pale pink Roma tomato slices and 9 shreds (I counted) of basil ... not the beautiful mounds of meltingly wonderful fresh mozzarella that should have been there, no piquant tomato taste ... It was DULL and the dough was average. And it cost more than the marvels they serve at Bar Cento! Baaad. Same for my husband's pepperoni with red peppers - what looked like jarred roasted red peppers dominated the dough. We both needed fresh pepper and salt to generate any recognizable flavor. Really disappointing.

Go for the beers - the look of the place and the prices demand better food."}
{"text":"Great selection of microbrews!  A good mix of both East and West Coast brews from some of my favorite breweries such as Dogfish and Bell's, as well as Belgian beers.  Good happy hour food menu as well including corn dogs, pizza, and mac n cheese.  Probably crowded on weekends, but a great place to hang out on weeknights as well."}
{"text":"Good Beer Selection expect a good selection of craft beer. Food is okay and probably better than I would have expected.
Had dinner tonight with a friend and we were both satisfied with our meal; our service; and the ambiance of the place. All were pretty good and I find more to like than not.
We split a crab cake for an app and I must say it was very, tasty. Perhaps the most crab I ever had in a crab cake but the overall flavors were really good.
My Caesar salad could have used a little more punch to it. I like a lot more anchovies flavor i mine, and in fact I would like an anchovy or tow on top. The romaine was very fresh, cold and crisp. Liked that part.
I had the Prosciutto Asiago Chicken on polenta accompanied by Squash & Zucchini. My take - chicken was cooked nicely and the prosciutto and good flavor. The asiago came through nicely and really set the entree apart. The polenta had good taste but was a little dry, but the Squash & Zucchini was really outstanding. Full of flavor, fresh, moist. Just top notch."}
{"text":"Went in for pre-dinner drinks.

Got ignored by bartender for 10 minutes (at 6:30 pm!)

Bartender then acknowledge I was alive and told me she had to help someone else first.  That someone was another bartender she was chatting with.

Left and went to Oliver Twist.  Got jumped on for service there. 

Go spit in the wind, Ballentine."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great sushi...and very fresh. You can't go here and not try the beer flights, burgers, pasta, and hell everything on the menu is good and fresh."}
{"text":"Oh, Ballantine, I don't know what to make of you! I think you could really shine if you didn't stretch yourself quite so thin in a misguided attempt at being trendy. It's nice that you're trying to branch out with your menu, but Asian fusion is clearly not your speciality, and I really think you need to work on perfecting a handful of specific dishes before overrunning your menu with mediocrely prepared options. (Those sushi nachos, though? Those were fab. Why can't everything on your menu be so yummy?!)

Service was absolutely terrible the evening we went as well! We visited on half-price sushi night, and as soon as we sat down my sister (a Ballantine veteran) asked the waitress if there was a wait on the sushi should we choose to partake, as the chefs can get quite backed up due to the deal. The waitress told us no, everything was running on schedule, but then added with a bit of attitude that sushi *does* take a while to prepare, as if we were uncultured dolts who had never heard of this mysterious delicacy before. Um, sushi actually doesn't take that long if you know what you're doing and there aren't a million orders up. I'd venture a guess that it's probably one of the quicker things to make on the menu. Definitely faster than a steak!

Our waitress continued to be pretty terrible. She dropped off our appetizer, but didn't bring any plates or silverware, and then disappeared! We had to flag another server down. After I asked for a water she vanished once again. After waiting ten minutes we had to flag down the same alternate waitress as before, who I assume gave our girl a bit of a talking to as she finally showed up, somewhat apologetic. \"Oh, right, I told you I was going to bring you a water, didn't I?\" It's not like Ballantine is a big place. Not that hard to keep track of your table!

Food, with the exception of the sushi nachos (Seriously, I LOVED those things, and they're the reason for three stars instead of two.) was mediocre. I got two sushi rolls and they tasted like something you'd pick up at the grocery store. I didn't try my brother-in-law's pad thai, but it looked watery and strange, not like any pad thai I've ever seen. Seriously disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. No more pierogies, no more lobster mac. Garlic knots had no garlic. The hand held brisket with alabama bbq was more like pot roast on a bun with coleslaw. Meat did not taste like it had been seasoned with anything. Very bland."}
{"text":"I've been on a bit of a Ballatine kick this summer. I might be biased because I worked there the first couple summers when it opened but I think it's a great pick in DT Willoughby.

The food is decent, but the best part is really the atmosphere and beer selection. I love the open windows that face the street. It's fun to place to have drinks with friends and split some appetizers. Try the Belgian fries.

I don't usually hang out here very late so I don't know about the supposed d-bags and bad music that seem to happen after a certain hour. I guess you have to figure out if that's true for yourself....ha?"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and highly recommend it.  

On Friday night, my friend and I wanted to go to dinner close to where I live so I said \"Ok.  Ballantine's.\"  (There isn't much choice in Willoughby unless you want to go to Panini's or the Willoughby Brewing Company.) 

The valet guy was very nice.  Also, no wait, but the place was crowded.  Our server (James [I EVEN REMEMBER HIS NAME, HE WAS SO GOOD]) was so helpful and, quite frankly, wonderful.  I asked him if he had a certain type of beer and he said he didn't, but offered two others I would like instead.  He knew his stuff.  

We ordered three different bruschettas for appetizers.  They were taking SO LONG.  My friend was getting annoyed.  They finally arrived, and James and (what I can assume is the GM) arrived, apologizing for the tardiness of the apps, and offering a round on the house.  They left and my friend said \"you know, that makes all the difference to me!  The service can be excellent but without the GM apologizing, I wouldnt give him a great tip but now, I would give that guy anything!\"  

The bruschetta was fantastic.  Yum.  Then came the entrees.  I had the salmon special.  IT WAS SO GOOD.  Like, really, really good.  My friend asked how it was and I said \"OMG.  This is magnificent.\"  I ate every last bite of it that I could scrape onto my fork.  He got the Flippin Good Burger.  I asked \"how is it?\"  He said he would actually like more onions on it (vegetables is what he called it) and said the fries were really good.  Against every fiber of his being and saying what I thought I would never hear him say: \"I think you need to write a YELP review about this place.  This is REALLY good.\"  

The only reason for four stars and not five is while our table was a pretty good table, it was really drafty, and we did wait a while for those apps and then to order entrees.  That said, I would highly recommend James and come back to Ballantine's again."}
{"text":"You get the feeling the chef at Ballantine is trying to do something a little more than the standard brewpub/burger place.  On the night we went, he has made his own ketchup. The food here is good, chef is clearly reaching for something more, even if he doesn't succeed you have to admire the effort.

For the record, the food was good, it all seemed to need a little tweaking, for example, homemade ketchup was a bit bland, my rib with thai style sauce had a thin sauce that fell off the ribs, so you couldn't really taste much of it. 

The restaurant does has a really long beer list and best of all, raspberry lambic on tap!!! as well as some other tasty brews. The restuarnat is beautiful, dark wood and open/screened windows to the street. This can be an issue if there are as many bikers at night as there sometimes are in Willoughby as it can be kind of loud. Still, it seems like a fun place, the servers wear vintage style bowling shirts and the menu changes daily. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"I'm from the west/ south side of Cleveland so I very rarely get a chance to try anything on the east side so I was excited to go here with some friends over the weekend. I had looked at the menu ahead of time and thought so many things sounded good on it. I had a hard time deciding that day, but ended up going with the Bangkok Peanut chicken bowl. This ended up being a good choice and was very filling. I thought it lacked a ton of flavor but it was good. My friends I was with all ordered different things- build your own pizza, pretzel chicken, and house pad thai. Everyone said their meals were really good. The service was good, we were seated right away (but had a reservation) and the drink menu was good. We were having a girls night out so we also returned later at night when this place turned into a club like atmosphere with a DJ. We actually ended up spending most of our night here and it was a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Ballentines. Met some friends for a birthday dinner, server was exceptional. Started with lobster nachos -delish! I ordered Pad Thai, the others ordered ribeye and filet. Pad Thai was good, not fantastic, but wasn't disappointed. My friend ordered a medium rare ribeye, she thought it was too well done. Our server was extremely gracious and took the steak back, brought back a new ribeye, which my friend cut in, & declared it was too rare (eye roll). Then manager came by to check and offered to cook the steak himself, which he did. I couldn't have asked for better service and we all had a great time! I would definitely go back again - and get the lobster nacho's and a ribeye!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place. The last visit was no exception. We had the Ballantine roll and spicy tuna roll to start. We really enjoyed the Ballantine roll, different and flavorful. For an entree we got the lamb special and a side of fries to split. For $26 we were not expecting much on the lamb, but it was 3 large bone in pieces served medium rare - it was glorious. I liked the polenta and goat cheese it was served over too. The malt vinegar aioli that was served with the fries was yummy as well. They have a fantastic beer selection and my Moscow mule was one of the best I've ever had - the ginger beer made the drink. And our drinks came really fast, zero wait time. Our server was on top of her game.  We will continue to frequent this place anytime we're in downtown Willoughby."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with the husband and he was always bragging about this place because you can get drinks, steak and sushi all in the same place.  

We went and shared a steak and sushi.  Both were wonderful and had an amazing meal!

Our server was also very nice and accomodating."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and excellent service. We had several different things from the menu, including the sushi special and lamb burger. They were perfect! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was fantastic, the food not so much. I ordered sushi, and it just didn't wow me or taste especially fresh. Granted, I have been spoiled the past few months with California sushi fresh from the ocean, so I may be a bit of a snob. The service was fine, drinks were appropriately alcoholic, and I had a nice time. But to pay so much money on food ($80ish), I expected to really like it!"}
{"text":"Ballantine is a tasteful gastropub in the quaint town of Willoughby. I've stopped a couple times to try their amazing selection of micro beers. They also make an outstanding house hamburger! 

The service was friendly and there is ample parking on the street. 

A great place to stop!"}
{"text":"Decided on this place because my boyfriend had a good experience last time he ate here, but something must have changed...new ownership or new management??

Staff clearly did not care about their jobs. First impression, I asked that we be sat somewhere warmer but we were relocated somewhere even colder, despite the fact there were plenty of warmer tables away from the window completely open. I had to leave the table in the middle of the meal and heat up by their fireplace in the back where they had sat zero people (??) It seemed to me they cared more about showing the street they were \"busy\" then making people comfortable.

You would think for the moderately high prices that their food, drinks, and service would reflect that quality, but unfortunately this was not the case. 

First was the drinks. We ordered a sidecar and a new york sour. Sidecar was the only decent thing about this meal. The New York Sour came out looking like cranberry juice and tasted strange. We asked the server what was in the drink and she said \"some cabernet\"...as in red wine. The cocktail only lists bulleit rye, fresh lemon, and simple syrup in the ingredients, I said. She replied \"Oh, do you not like it??\" As if we were from another planet. 

Then comes the food. We ordered the mussels and the endive salad to start. The mussels were not bad, just ok, but the salad was very disappointing. Tasted completely bland and maybe had 2 pecans on the whole thing. Leaves were very large and difficult to eat too. I'm usually a big fan of salad in any form. 

We split the fish of the day, sea bass, but could not believe how bland that was also. Sea bass is hard to mess up, but they managed to succeed in making it bad. It was swimming in oil and had no flavor. Sea bass is a fatty fish with buttery flavor, it doesn't need extra oil...it needs seasoning. The broccoli we got as the side lists \"garlic, chilies\" as it's seasoning, but the broccoli came out completely unseasoned, no flavor, no garlic or chilies. 

The bill was $72 and nearly everything was subpar or awful. Their menu descriptions are completely inaccurate. Do yourselves a favor and go to Willoughby Brewery right across the street instead, save yourself a terrible experience and save yourself some money at the same time. This place is not worth it."}
{"text":"Who's sex is on fire? 
Belgian drafts served by hambones. 
Cigarette butt toss. 

The first line is in reference to Ballantine's theme song by Kings of Leon. At one point, the song was played twice in the span of 10 minutes. If this song is on heaven's playlist, I'd rather burn in hell. The rest of the tunes didn't impress either. Progressively through the night they actually got worse until eventually morphing into a soundtrack more appropriate for a gay dance club than a brewpub.  

The second line refers to the staff. I just expected the bartenders to offer a little more knowledge and expertize about the extensive craft beer offerings. Instead, the bartenders appeared to be imported from BW3's. 

The third and final line is in reference to a near fatal encounter of friendly fire upon leaving Ballantine. Outside, droves of chain smokers catch a buzz. One drunken blonde in particular chose my leg as target practice. My last memory was a glowing ember of carcinogenic proportions heading straight towards my denim covered half. It was unavoidable. I was a casualty. Ouch."}
{"text":"This spot is really a 3.5 type trendy restaurant in downtown Willoughby. Friendly servers and cool decor with bar, long tables or booths, all good for group seating. I liked how the garage windows could be open on a nice day. Bar tvs for the game. We showed our room card for a free appetizer as instructed by our hotel, but server said that was old promo, was a lil put off because we had a party of 6 they got the business due to a real promo flyer, so they could just honor it.. Oh well, they had a happy hour that had a good variety so we ordered our food, a mix of regular items and happy hour. 

We ordered a firecracker roll to share as appetizer. Due to kitchen call in we sat there for an hour with no food, we were starving. Bummed that they didn't make the pizza or adjust to bring other items out where they had help? Just not creative problem solvers at all here. Finally a manager apologized and got us some tasty wontons with cheesy chicken dip w/ sirracha that was some service recovery, or really just free app we should have received any way. Most of the food was really good when it finally arrived, some items are interesting but not very good. They have a huge menu so you can find something for everyone, huge beer selection and full bar."}
{"text":"Food is good, and the beer selection is large (for this area) but limited; the management has a very obvious raging boner for IPAs...branch out a bit."}
{"text":"Before Gordon Elliot did Doornock Dinners and Tyler Florence did Food 911 there was Sara Moulton Cooking Live and my favorite (of all time) Two Fat Ladies.  They were the best.  Drank, smoked during the whole show and made real food with butter and sass.  This place reminds me of them, but with a Hungarian feel.  Schnitzel, chicken livers and paprikash.  All homemade.  So heavy ya need a nap and take a huge dump after.  I came here for a birthday celebration last year and loved it.  Very similar to a few places in Slavic Village but way more polished.  Here ya have to deal with finding parking or be a tool and valet.  If it were on the West Side I would come more often.  Red Chimney and Seven Roses are closer for me...and I can still buy rocks just up the block!  

L√≥nak n√©gy a l√°ba, m√©gis megbotlik."}
{"text":"Upscale bar with good sushi and nice pad tai. Doesn t replace your normal Thai place of course but cool setting and good to watch games."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fantastic. The service was perfect from our server Katie, to the kitchen staff, all the way to the busser! The sushi was delicious as were our main courses. I would highly recommend this place to anyone! If you're looking for a great meal or a large craft beer selection this is a place you should check out!"}
{"text":"My review is definitely in need of a revision.

I went to Ballantine last week to celebrate my mother's birthday and had an excellent VEGAN meal. Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus! And you can find vegan food in good old Downtown Willoughby.

I started off my meal with an avocado roll and a cucumber roll. You can tell that the sushi is made in house and it tasted fresh. I could have eaten about 10 more rolls. They were that good.

Then for my meal, I had vegan lasagna with a tofu ricotta cheese. Sounds weird if you're not a vegan, but you'd never be able to tell the difference between tofu cheese and the real deal in this dish. It was full of fresh veggies and a zesty sauce and was really satisfying. 

I washed all of my grub down with a Moscow Mule or 5. Served in a copper mug, it tasted as it should. 

There were a couple other vegan items on the menu that sounded interesting and I'd love to go back for more sushi. They just launched a new menu in late August 2014, so if you haven't been to Ballentine in awhile, it's worth a visit again."}
{"text":"Decent food and hit or miss service. Definitely not a place high on my list anymore for dinner. They do have a pretty nice draft selection though! 

The last few times I have visited for a drink, there hasn't been a huge crowd. Starting to think it's just the general DT Willoughby area..."}
{"text":"Ballantine was on my list of places to try in this area for a long time. We decided to go for New Year's Eve. I was very excited but I heard some mixed reviews. The wait staff was very friendly. The ambiance was nice. We ordered the special for the holiday. Our first course was Artichoke Toast. It was a piece of artichoke on a crouton with \"prosciutto\" (pretty sure it was bologna) Ew. The salad appetizer was a head of romaine chopped in half with cherry tomatoes and little balls of mozzarella thrown on top with some sort of gross balsamic dressing. The main courses (steak and scallops) were decent but left a lot to be desired.. they also charge about $40 for a $5.99 bottle of wine. This place has a nice presentation but as far as flavor and quality goes, it's not worth it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The Ballantine roll is to die for!  I would give a 5 star but the bar service usually leaves me wanting more. I don't like having to ask for refills one what seem like slow nights."}
{"text":"We always loved going here,but since they rebranded the food has not been the same. We were there the other night and we had  bad service and the food was not that good. They did have the  best sushi around  but not any more"}
{"text":"My family and I had a great experience here.  Service was great food was awsome and l thought it was nice that dave the manager went to every table to make sure everything was ok.  I will defiantly be back and I do recommend ballantine.  P.S.  best sushi in town"}
{"text":"Spicy tuna roll was great, awesome beer selection.  Also ordered the lobster nachos which were just ok, and the steak appetizer, which was awful. Oily and flavorless.. For the price I expected much more."}
{"text":"So here's my update on Ballantine...

After my negative review that I wrote in October, the manager (a friend of mine) sent me a message apologizing for the incident.  He also mentioned that he had fired the bouncer who was acting like an ass that night.

The only problem is that he didn't fire that bouncer.  He continues to work at this bar, and he's still up to the same old tricks.  A few weeks ago a friend of mine saw him hitting on some younger girl.  My friend went up to the girl and told her that the bouncer was an asshole.  Her reply was that 2 other people had already told her the same thing!

He's over 40.  He's got a wife and kids apparently, and that doesn't stop him.  He also works at Fitworks.  So be aware that he may try to solicit business from you when he should be cleaning tables and keeping the peace.  

Enjoy your Ballantine experience people!  :)"}
{"text":"Avoid the $28 scallops. Three scallops that when stacked are approximately the size of 1.25 'normal' scallops.  Willoughby isn't New York City."}
{"text":"Yummy food.   Swanky steakhouse feel.  I got the ribeye medium rare and it was quite tastey with the mushroom sauce.   Limited wine selection but the wines I had (Malbec and Cab) were very acceptable.  Wide range of food options.  Everything from Burgers, pastas, steaks, SUSHI!, lobster nachos.... something for everyone.   A touch overpriced for overall. Slur in my opinion but I certainly enjoyed my meal and my dinning experience."}
{"text":"Seems like all my fellow Elite's on Yelp have nailed the review on Ballantine's.  I personally have been coming to Ballantine's for over 3 years off and on both for food and fun.  The food itself has made some changes about 2.5 years ago and has been going pretty strong since.  Their happy hour apps at that bar are well worth it, beer selection is fantastic, and even the martinis are poured appropriately if you know what I mean.

As for fun, its the typical Willoughby late night crowd, 21-31 yr old booze hungry people looking for the usual late night hook-up, not really here for the ambiance, just here because it appears that 'classier' girls hang out at Ballantine's.  Regardless, to each their own right!, no biggie because I'm usually closer to home by the time all this action starts so I enjoy Ballantine's for what it has to offer as a hip \"gastropub\" type venue between the hours of 5 and 10.

Overall, I do like Willoughby, enjoy the small town feel, and love the potential for great food, but just hope that the late night partying doesn't take away from the realness of Downtown Willoughby and what all the owners take pride in.  

Added kudos for the 1899 pub being part of the Ballantine family."}
{"text":"We've been to Ballantine several times - mostly because some friends of ours live close and always want to go there. They have an excellent beer selection, true. But for me, that's only part of the story. I feel a lot of restaurant/bars get an un-earned pass sometimes just because they have lots of beers on tap. Ok, props where props are due, but you're not automatically awesome just based on the beer. Ballantine, however, stands on its own feet. 

The food is pretty good, with a little something for everyone. How about grilled scallops or perhaps the sausage platter (Sconnie love) for an appetizer? They have wood-fired pizzas which are good.  Aged beef cuts are Ballantine's signature and they are very good, if a bit more pricey than your average 'gastropub' fare. But they are the real deal (35 day aging, inventive flavor combintions, rubs, etc.) And they are LARGE cuts too. 

Good food, many many beers. Try it out if you're in the area for dinner."}
{"text":"Trendy place. Craft beers are very good. freshly made sushi is excellent. packed on weekends. Service here is also excellent, even when it is busy. Ate here during a Cavs Finals game, and the crowd was extremely lout ( understandably ) , but normally that is not the case. I've been here twice, while they are packed, and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have frequented this bar many times on the weekends and seems to be the meeting place before going to other bars in downtown Willoughby.  The ultra-lounge atmosphere of the restaurant could very well fit into the downtown scene of any major city.  The bar curates a great selection of rotating draft micro-beers so there is always something new to try out.  The setting is equipped with a beautiful golden illuminated bar and trendy pictures on the wall.  Props to the person in charge of the music as there is always a good danceable playlist that does not have one top forty hit on it.

So why the low score?  The service on the weekends.  The bar gets easily crowded on weekends and it appears they are always one bar tender too short to handle patrons well.  And don't be fooled by the atmosphere because the bar can attract some very low-brow crowds. 

A night at Ballentine's could be hit or miss"}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and good beer list, but the food is not up to par.

As I said, the beer list is good, but it has also been better. I enjoyed it more when they had more of a belgian influence. In my recent visit, it was mostly american craft beer focused with only a few imports.

I've been there a number of times in the past, but rarely eaten dinner. I mostly get appetizers and drinks. They used to have a solid happy hour menu with the mussels and fries being my favorite. Those are now gone.

In my recent visit, I choose to order a full dinner. It's an eclectic menu with items that are all over the place. They have sushi, wood fired pizza, noodle dishes, burgers and high end steaks. At first glance, it looks like they are trying too hard to be trendy. I enjoy fusion, but this menu went too far. Surf and turf sushi? No thanks. I decided to stick to something a little more classic.

I ordered the pad thai. The description was that of a typical pad thai, the result was not. It was supposed to have peanuts, fresh chilies, egg, chicken, shrimp, etc. What came out was overcooked noodles, soupy sauce, runny egg, red peppers? and no peanuts. I will say that the shrimp was tasty and cooked to perfection. I've had pad thai out of a box from the grocery store, off of a food truck and from many thai restaurants. It's always been a pretty safe dish for me. I don't know what this was, but it was not pad thai. I sent it back.

I ended up splitting the pizza my wife ordered. The crust was great, but the sauce, cheese and toppings were just okay.

The service wasn't bad, although I will say that the manager never bothered to stop by after I sent back my food.

I will be back for drinks and maybe appetizers, but not dinner. Based on the quality of the food, I'll probably avoid their sushi. Why shouldn't I? There are two solid sushi restaurants in walking distance.

If I owned this place, I'd refocus on what I'm good at and stop trying so hard to have trendy food."}
{"text":"When I'm in DTW and don't wanna get smashed or really rage but want to enjoy a cocktail with normal people who aren't going bonkers this is the place to go!   They have amazing food too!  My fav is coming on a perfect weather night when the patio doors are wide open to savor beautiful historic downtown Willoughby Ohio!"}
{"text":"Worst, bitchiest bartenders ever. Go somewhere else. There's plenty of other places to go within walking distance with significantly better service."}
{"text":"Ouch, definite buzz kill during my b-day festivities. After midnight this place turns into a west 6th asshole hangout. Not recommended for people who have mortgages now. I can't understand how such a classy, progressive spot devolves within an hour into a neanderthug hell hole. I know it's easy revenue, but the potential for a door shuttering violent incident is too great. Kick the damn kids out!"}
{"text":"First time coming here with my girlfriend and this place is phenomenal. Atmosphere is great and the decor is something different. I got a pizza and it was probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had. The salad I got was fresh and the ginger dressing was something out of this word. COME HERE AND EAT"}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection on tap! However, if you have questions about the selection, the bartenders don't seem to be the most knowledgeable. On the bright side, they are pretty to look at, so there's that. 

I had already eaten before stopping by, but the food looked pretty appetizing. The place has valet parking in the back along with the brewery and the other restaurants on that side of the street."}
{"text":"My friend and I recently went to Ballantine for a quick lunch. We both had a veggie burger and asparagus. Overall the food was ok. I was honestly expecting more from what I had heard of the place. The portion size was great but I think the burger lacked a lot of flavor. A decent meal and the staff was kind, courteous and prompt. 

Nothing too exciting to write about. I'll probably stop back to see what else is going on in there but for the price I expected more."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times since it originally opened. The food's always been average, so I never really made it a 'go-to' establishment. I live close to downtown Willoughby so I pass by here all the time. I've been shocked at how crowded it is every time, so I just had to go back. It's now one of my favorite DTW restaurants!

Our server, Nicole, was outstanding. She made us feel like we were the only ones in the place. I was being very picky about my beer choice, and she had no problem bringing me different samples. We started dinner off with a spicy spicy salmon roll. I'm usually a little hesitant to order sushi from a non-traditional restaurant, but this was really good. The salmon had that 'melt in your mouth' flavor and consistency. One of my dining companions ordered the rainbow roll and I couldn't get over the size of it! I will definitely be back when I have a sushi craving.

Our meals were top notch. I ordered the scallops and scampi. It came on top of pork fried rice. Originally, I was sceptic of the pork fried rice being paired with shellfish. The chunks of pork in the rice tasted like they were candied. So delicious! 

Another person at the table ordered the bone in pork chop that was on special. I can't really tell you how it tasted because it was devoured before I could ask for a bite! I'm guessing it was good.

Downtown Willoughby is becoming a hotspot for visitors. When looking for a place to dine, Ballantine is it hands down.  I'm so happy that I live less than a mile from here!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for after dinner drinks on a Saturday evening. We were seated and waited in immediately. Our server was very attentive. I had a Bellini, the drink itself was pretty good, however, it came out filled to the rim which in turn made it spill a little making the glass and table sticky.....nothing that a little water didn't fix.

After 10 pm the place turns into more of a club/lounge atmosphere. The ambiance was nice and this a place I would go back to."}
