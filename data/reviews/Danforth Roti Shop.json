{"text":"Awesome place. Best roti and jerk chicken. Have been going here for years and have never been disappointed. Service is fast and staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Good soca music. Want to try the curry conch. Most rotis 8$. Doubles 1.50$ like most places has sea moss on the menu but they are always out!
 
Chicken curry roti is pretty good, but it is usually a safe bet.

Only one table for seating so take out oriented."}
{"text":"Just went in to get a few Roti Skins I got the Pea. Was making roti at home just needed skins. They are Amazing very tasty & I'm going back to try some of the food. Love supporting the small establishments. A few in line ahead ordering lots of food so I'm going back. Looks like I found my New take out place."}
{"text":"I don't have anything to compare this to so I may change this later.  I had the chicken curry roti plus 1 extra veggie filling.  My friend had 3 veggie roti (chickpeas, pumpkin and spinach).  We did eat in at  1 of the tables, more of a take out place."}
{"text":"Was craving some good curry goat and walked in off of Danforth ave,stood there for almost 5 mins waiting for someone to say hi be right there..they glanced over without a word and left me standing there,so i left.  Found another good place half a block away,too bad for them they are out the money and any future business."}
{"text":"I usually always get the doubles here. They're always very friendly, and the doubles are really tasty, and they put a good amount of spice in them. Will have to try some of the other stuff sometime if it's as good as the doubles this might become one of my fav caribbean places."}
{"text":"Today is my last time going here. Yeah their food is fine. But I ordered a small curry chicken and rice to pick up. When I saw the size I asked if I could pay extra and get a large instead. The lady said she it was extra work and she would have to charge me for the two containers. Seriously? She then told me I was free to buy food from somewhere else.

I didn't move to Toronto to get typical lazy, greedy Trinidad service. I'll take my money elsewhere to a place that actually cares about their reputation"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I normally don't come here because I never liked the food before but apparently there's a new cook or something and the food is so flavourful now. As with all west Indian restaurants, be prepared for things running out or having a bunch of stuff on the menu that aren't available to order. 

There is one table with three chairs so needless to say this is not really a place to dine in but none the toys worth a try. I got the curry shrimp with rice and peas and I enjoyed it very much. My only complaint would be that you should get more than four pieces of shrimp. 

The cashier was also pretty nice and helpful so I'd come here again."}
{"text":"I get the boneless goat roti and it is always delicious. I enjoy the doubles as well."}
{"text":"Tasty doubles and friendly service.  It's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken roti for lunch.  Was pretty good.  Nothing to write home about but definitely palatable.  Satisfying and reasonably priced but that's all."}
{"text":"Very declious authentic trini roti. I've had several things on the menu. The curry chicken is very good. Well seasoned. The paratha is also very delicious almost taste like the good stuff back in Trinidad. The beef roti is also very delicious. My favorite, very mouth watering and filling. I love that they also sell peardrax here too one of the best drinks of life."}
{"text":"Each time I go, I am charged differently for the same types of food ordered. They seem to be more forgiving towards people from their ethnicity. When I go with friends from a similar background, portions are more generous and the cost is less. It's quite magical!

Food is hit or miss. Sometimes it's great and other times, not so much (not very fresh).

Ordered doubles a few times and they were so soggy. Only once when I ordered doubles were they crispy on the outside and even on the in.

The place is so small that dining in isn't very comfortable nor convenient. Better to do take out.

There are far better places along the Danforth for rotis and curry. It's infrequently that I visit this joint, for obvious reasons."}
{"text":"Excellent take out food.  Great customer service.  The little things matter a lot.  Try the curry chicken roti with pumkin (A+)."}
