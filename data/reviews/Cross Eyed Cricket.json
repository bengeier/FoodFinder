{"text":"Went for an early dinner tonight and had great service and food. Happy to have a new place to eat nearby. Loved the TV's around the bar and the huge one in the middle. I'll have to go again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great Wings and Fries.  Nice place, I wish their mixed drinks were larger. I'm glad Vistancia has a Neighborhood Place."}
{"text":"Thank God there's a new restaurant in Vistancia!  They just opened this week, so patience and tolerance is necessary while they work out their s#!t. It's a big open (loud) restaurant with a huge bar, tables (no booths), pool tables, shuffleboard, darts, golf game, TVs, etc.  Good customer service and free (unsecure) WiFi.  I predict this place will be packed with dads during Suns season."}
{"text":"Great improvement on service! The food has been good every time. We live within feet of the front door so we had high hopes. The first couple weeks were rocky but now it's on point. Our server Carly was professional and prompt. Great job cross Eyed Cricket!"}
{"text":"Great new place in Vistancia! Stopped in for a quick drink. Staff was friendly, atmosphere was casual. Love the HUGE wall screen tv for the games. Definitely going to become the neighborhood hangout."}
{"text":"This place has been open for a little over a week. They are still getting used to things and were out of something so they couldn't make the rubens until the truck came.   We had the zucchini for an appetizer. My friend had the Old-timer (cheeseburger) with onion rings. I had the nachos with chili on the side. I'm picky about chili (hence having it on the side) and it was pretty tasty-had a little sweetness to it. Salsa and guacamole were good. Also, they use the good kind of chips. I would order it again.   Beer was cold (very important). I think it can always be colder though.   We were going to order dessert but they said they didn't have that yet. She said the are slowly adding stuff to the menu (that's why the menu is a piece of paper) to get everyone used to it. Eventually they will be adding desserts. They are thinking of doing a fried PB&J as one but are open to suggestions.   Service was awesome!   I will definitely be back and can't wait to sit out on the huge patio (with TV) during the winter."}
{"text":"Took father in law in yesterday for Fathers Day and was told it was a family friendly new restaurant in our neighborhood after stopping by few weeks ago.   This is not the case in the slightest-nothing about this restaurant aside from shuffle board is kid friendly. There is not a kids menu; we were told they have it on the computer but not on the menus that are printed (white paper staples together) yet, not even crayons for kids to color while waiting for food.   We were in this restaurant for a total of one hour and fifty minutes which may or may not seem long to some folks however we did not order alcohol and had to wait for over THIRTY minutes to just have our debit card run to pay. The food was less than desirable to include: over well & rubbery burgers, cheese on items asked for no cheese, waiting on fries for over 15 minutes and the list could go on. When this was brought to the attention of our server the reply was simply, \"I told them no cheese\". We placed our order and waited close to 35 minutes to receive our food which would not have been horrible aside from our server having only one other table as we came in at opening time. There were THREE families and sat down, waited and left due to not being greeted and served while we were there even after one of them held up the paper menus and waived them around for service.   Completely deflated by experience and witness to our service than what was advertised. Hoping this place can turn around and target the audience intended soon or we had a fluke of a visit."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great location. Food is also very good and fresh. Will be a great place to watch football and hockey this fall. Bartenders are also very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hopefully the owners will get their act together... shouldn't open a restaurant until staff is trained and menus are not printed on copy paper. Tonic water was flat. Will try them again in a month, hopefully I can update my rating to a 4 or 5."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings unfortunately....I know they're new and I expect kinks, but bad food and drinks is just bad food and drinks. That's the staple to keep people coming back for more. Service was average, nothing extraordinary but everyone was working hard. Place was busy on a Tuesday night. We ordered zucchini as an appetizer and the texture of the zucchini was weird. Almost chewy? I ordered the margarita which had very little alcohol if any. Wouldn't get either again. Main course our table had fish tacos and chicken tenders. Fish tacos were fishy tasting but the chicken tenders and fries were good. All in all, not sure we'd crave to go back but I do wish them success. It's nice to get some new business out here."}
{"text":"Woo Hoo!!!! Live music in Vistancia!!! Great food and lots of fun!!! I recommend the Buffalo Chicken Wrap - it was delicious!!!! I'll definitely be back!!!  Josh Roy and Ted Kenyon are a great duo!!!"}
{"text":"First impressions are so important . I am hopeful they will not take the lack of choice for granted . My first experience was disappointing .  I am giving some grace and will return in 30 days at which point I will re evaluate my review ."}
{"text":"It's nice to have another eating establishment in Vistancia, but lacks comfort and warm neighborhood appeal. Seating is tables and chairs (no booths), darts, pool and plenty of sports playing on multiple tv's. Menu is brief, no kids menu at this time (which will hopefully change with such a large clientele of families).  Service is ok, orders come out at different times, sometimes incorrect.  Drinks are good (kudos bartender) and food is good. The Porky Pig sandwich is exceptional, and the reason I will return. Outside of that, it's a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant in vistancia, moved into the old American Grill 71 empty space. If it was not for the chairs and tables when you walk in you would think it is a gray low light warehouse. They could have brightened it up, even for a sports bar. No atmosphere.   The food: great attempt of heating and frying pre made , pre bought frozen appetizers and entrees. The waitress mentioned that menu was temporary till they work out all the grand opening problems and they got their grove. I think what they need is a cook that can cook!  I will let them get their grove, I will be back in a few weeks and try again. Hope they can improve. If they can't. I see them going out in a year just like American Grill 71 and Blue Agave before them."}
