{"text":"While walking around Montreal, we found this place to drink some coffee and eat some crepes with the boys.  Looks nice from outside.  The crepes they sold as organic, nothing taste like a crepe.   Very little chocolate spread, couple of strawberries and 2-3 thin slices of banana.  We paid $85 something for 4 crepes, and 2 coffee and 1 soft drink.  I asked whipped cream on top and they charged $3 for each whipped cream topping.

I highly NOT recommend this place.  And another weird thing is, they put a old fancy sofa and dining table, and out a sign \"reserved\" on them.  Very small place, people are looking where to sit and drink coffee or tea, the owners use \"bait-and-switch\" tactic.  At 2 pm who will reserve a dining table of 8 and a sofa of 3.  Its their showing off.  Again this place a tourist trap because it is so close to Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica they think they can sell anything whatever the price it is.   Shame on you!"}

Specially the smoke salmon bagels

{"text":"Excellent pastries!! Served with fresh fruit slices on the side. Have to try the Homemade Baklava!!! Not too sweet. Berry cheesecake. Coffee and tea. Glacé     
Parisian ambience. Most of all, very warm and friendly husband-wife owners. !!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to pit stop as we waited for the Aura show at the Basilica of Notre Dame. They have pastries, coffee, sweet crepes, savory crepes, gelato, and regular drinks. I decided to get the milk chocolate crepe and it was amazing. And to pair with it? An iced latte. Both were delicious. 

To top it off, the place is quite quaint and has this old, castle-like feeling to it. Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Perfect."}
