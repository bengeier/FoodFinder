{"text":"Amazing little gem in Bay Village. We had stopped in for Sunday Brunch and sat outside within their nicely decorated patio. The food was amazingly fresh and so good. I got the breakfast nan and ordered corn beef hash on the side. While my wife got crab cake benedicts. I'm surprised no one really knows about this place yet. We loved it and will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by on a Friday night to have dinner on the patio. It was just lovely!  The chief had created two amazing specials that evening, which my wife and I both ordered.  I chose the salmon. The salmon was topped with a strawberry chutney and served over purée sweet potatoes with a side of asparagus.  (a very good flavor combination!) My wife had the scallops severed over Angel hair pasta top off with pesto.  Portion of each meal was really good size for the price. Love this place and will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed cocktails, apps and dinner here. Lobster bisque was great, and the local greens salad was both delicious and large enough to share. Salmon over Sweet potato purée, was delicious also. The scallops with potato gratin and basil aoli were excellent. We were able to sit outside on a nice Friday evening which was great. Our sever was perfect, too. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Have enjoyed lunch and Sunday brunch several times. Love the brunch because the menu includes egg dishes, favorites like an awesome french toast, sandwiches,  salads and desserts. Something for everyone! Ambiance is modern. Service is excellent. Lovely little patio."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Atmosphere aesthetically cold and physically cold and not comforting. We've had brunch here twice and both times very delicious. Place should have line out the door. Need to redecorate, take the table cloths off the tables and not have their wait staff dress so formal. Guaranteed you'd have more customers. Would have given it a 5 star rating of atmosphere was better."}
{"text":"What a nice reward for trying something completely new and different. My wife and I try new spots or try to, every Friday to kick off the weekend. After finding the moosehead had caught fire and was closed down the evening before, we opted to try this little bistro that we've seen many times but never stopped at. We were in extra casual attire but the place leans to the. Over side. Wine glasses on the tables with silverware on linen napkins. We realized this upon walk up but pushed on and found we were the only table inside. There were others on the patio but we had the place to ourselves. The entrees can be upwards of 25-35 for steaks and seafood but we were feeling more like a burger and some sides. Wifey ordered the burger with fries, while I went for a seasonal salad and a lobster bisque, only available on fridays. And we split it all. The bisque was king here this fortnight, but the burger was ridiculously good as well. The salad was not to be meddled with either, and could easily have taken the title at any other establishment if it weren't for the sheer palette bursting flavors of the bisque and burger. The service was spot on too as you would expect it to be with almost no one in attendance. They have nightly specials, like burger nights with a beer for very cheap, like $6. I think that's Monday's. They have gyro's too on Wednesday's I think. Would be great if they can stick around for awhile, I've heard this spot has changed hands a few times over the years. No reason it should now, the food is top notch for date nights.  Found it somewhat intriguing there was no salt and pepper on any of the tables. That hardly merits the deduction of a star, considering everything was seasoned to perfection!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and out-dated food for people ages 60+.  Fig and goat cheese flat bread was sickeningly sweet. Scallops were placed in a soggy sauce with no sear on the outside."}
{"text":"My mother and I ate here a few weeks back, and all I can say is this place is a gem!  It was a quiet night, with only one other couple dining.  Such a shame that it was not more busy, as I want this place to succeed!!!  My mom had the mini osso buco and a side salad - so tasty and the salad, which was huge!!! We shared this, as it really is quite large. I enjoyed the pork loin alot, and the cherry reduction was spot on.  Our service was great, and the owner took the time to chat with us and thank us for visiting.  My mom has been back twice, and I plan on going for a burger this week, as I hear they are fantastic.  Give this place a try.  You will be happy!"}
{"text":"Had a blissful experience here! Definitely not what you would expect from the outside. The patio is wonderful and service was fantastic! My waiter was super attentive and very helpful! Cocktails were made properly (by the book to a T) and the food was so flavorful and very well plated. Wonderful hidden gem! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Closed for business at 9:40pm on a Thursday. Place might not be in business any more..."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times, and the food has been fabulous each time.  Service is great, Valerie has been wonderful.  The food does take time to arrive, but we've not been pressed for time.  Also allows for more leisurely vino/beer sipping and time for catching up."}
{"text":"Very nice, quaint restaurant in lovely Bay Village! They have a nice patio and lovely bar and restaurant area as well. My husband and I stopped in on Friday and were so happy we did. I had an excellent lobster bisque and my husband had the scallop appetizer which was also excellent. Our main dishes were also beautifully prepared! We will back and you should try it as well, especially if you're a fellow bay villager!! Support our community!! Service was also excellent!! Thanks"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by friends and I'll definitely be returning. Went on Wednesday night for the $6 burger special and it was fantastic. One of the best burgers that I've ever had. Very fresh. Toasted bun. Came with some great handmade chips. A very filling meal. Can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu! Neighborhood gem and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I have been twice for a late lunch. First time the food was great but took close to 30 minutes to come out for 4 sandwiches. We were still impressed with the food and service so gave it another try today. We called ahead to order so we wouldn't run into timing issues again. This worked out well as the food was ready very shortly after we arrived. However, the portions on the salads (arugula and salmon Caesar) were rather small considering the price and just weren't as good as what we had last visit. The biggest problem we had was that when we asked for a glass of iced tea to go, we were told it would be $0.70 each in order to cover the cost of the cup and lid. Mind you, we had each spent close to $20 for lunch, so to be nickel and dimed for a to-go cup seems pretty outrageous. Yes it's not that much money but that is such poor customer service. Very tacky, especially since we only got a small coffee cup to-go. Very likely will not be back."}
{"text":"Went out to connect with friends for dinner. Made reservations for 6 people at 583 Bistro in Bay Village.  What a hidden gem!  This place was simply awesome!  Easy to find with lots of parking.  Inside as well designed and decorated.  Food was amazing. The group ordered off both the happy hour and regular menu for drinks and food.  Drinks were spot on. Food was amazing. Honestly some of the best food I have had in a long time. Everything was perfectly fresh, carefully made and presented. Very upscale casual food.  We will definitely spread the word about 583 Bistro and return!  If you are looking for great food at a great place, be sure to choose here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight, a Friday evening to have a glass of wine on their patio. We had not stopped in prior to and were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. It is quaint, clean and comfortable inside and the patio is equally inviting.   Rachel, our server, was attentive and accommodating. Prices were fair and after reviewing the menu we decided to get the Big Dipper platter (hummus & baba). Food was great and we hope to be back very soon."}
