{"text":"The owner is super nice!!!!!!!! The food is wonderful~ Love it. Hope i can go there again. BTW, I had bean curd knife sliced noodle."}
{"text":"Humble, simple, and close to the authentic. Would go back again if craving beef brisket noodle soup or wontons."}
{"text":"cheap and tasty taiwanese food.  knife cut noodles is a specialty.  chef/owner will make vegetarian versions upon request."}
{"text":"Very good taiwanese food and the lady is always very friendly. I love their beef noodles soup. The service might be slow compared to other restaurant but they made almost every dish upon order. Don't go there if you are in rush. I also loved their home cookies. The price is more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Among my circle of friends we call this place the 'slow noodle' ever since it was introduced to me as such. Why slow noodle? Because if you're in a rush, no point coming here..  I like to diversify, but every time I come here I get the same thing: the flat noodles with the smoked tofu, extra spicy.. Amazing for vegans like me! I'm sure their other dishes are just as amazing, but not ready to try them just yet...  To minimize the wait, I call in my order ahead of time.  And she is always eager to give me her homemade dessert: those butter cookies that break up in the paper bag. I smile and humbly accept them, then focus on the pleasure of devouring my noodles and tofu..  I definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love the food at this place specially the wonton soup. They don't use MSG (Monosodium Glutamate) which in my book is a big plus. The place is a very simple and friendly. The menu is on the wall when you enter the place and the place is run by a charming old lady"}
{"text":"Great Restaurant, Amazing prices, great staff!!  This is an excellent hole in the wall restaurant. I am going to preface this review by saying that if you want excellent food, but dont care about the ambiance, then this is the place for you. If however you are trying to impress someone, or looking for a more fancy deco type place, this isn't it. It is a no frills asian restaurant where the focus is on the food, and not on the decoration  Overall, the food was excellent, with VERY affordable prices.  I got the hot and sour soup which was delicious, filled with lots of tofu and quite flavourful ($3.99). My friend got the homestyle noodles, which was a large portion of noodles with minced port and vegetables ($7.99). The food was delicious, and NOT GREASY which is rare for many asian places. We were there for a while, and whatever came out of the kitchen just looked delicious.   The service was also excellent. It is a family run operation, and the cute lade (sister-in law of the owner) was super friendly and helpful when ordering. She was also quite good about refilling the tea and whatnot.   I would definitely return to try the other stuff  Summary:    Food 5/5   Service 5/5   Decorations 3/5"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow, but the owner was very friendly and the food was good. She explained that they do not use any MSG and that they make their own noodles. Portions were generous and the soups were not salty."}
{"text":"There isn't very many taiwanese restaurants in town and this one is my favorite restaurant to go to. Even though they don't have bubble tea ( like typical taiwanese snack places do), the food there is like a slow home cooked meal. From first entering the door, you get the welcoming by this very nice Asian lady that smiles all the time!   Don't get me started with the food, the food here is amazing. They have a good chicken leg on rice, beef noodle soup and many others that I have tried.   If you're in a rush to get a quick dinner, this is not the place to be. They really do take the time to cook your meal really well. It's a family owned business and I recommend everyone get to know the people who work at the restaurant. They are genuinely nice people!  Options to pay include cash and debit. The tip option is automatic of 50 cents. Anyone who does end up paying debit, I recommend you have cash cause she'll say that 50 cents is enough tip."}
{"text":"Love this place, very friendly women that runs it, always saying xie xie (thank you). They make home made noodles and dumplings. Noodles are some of the best Ive ever had, thick and chewy just how I like it. My favourite dishes are Twice cooked chicken or pork with noodles, Won ton noodle soup, Coriander chicken with noodles and they make a nice taiwanese pancake. Prices are good as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"One of the first thing the restaurant cook and main waitress tells us as she hands us the menu is \"Real soup no MSG\". Well, she might have put some MSG as her \"signature\" dish the Wonton and Noodle soup lacked flavour and depth. Even worse, her soup base was so bland it made the few leaves of floating lettuce taste like stale vegetables. As for the dumpling, they were slightly overcooked and could have used some seasoning. Noodles had the perfect ratio outer firmness to internal softness."}
{"text":"I came in because my belly was begging  for a wonton soup to ward off the cold. I sort of got overwhelmed by the wall menu and ordered a noodle in roasted chicken thigh soup instead. What I GOT was actually a bowl of hot soup and noodles perfumed with coriander and generously festooned with bite-sized chunks of crunchy lettuce.  Annnnnd... a side of the umami-est roasted leg and thigh of chicken that I've tasted in months.  Plus tea. Plus cookies.  All for $10.00. Crazy!!  So, for a little hole in the wall and admittedly tired looking restaurant,  you can expect excellent value for your lunch dollar."}
{"text":"Very friendly service, food is delicious home-made, inexpensive, and generally great. I'll definitely be returning there often!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat on a budget at this family restaurant. Cheap, good and homemade.   You'll often see the grandmother chopping broccoli of cauliflower on her lap with a cleaver. Quite interesting to watch.  Everything on the menu is a hit, although the homemade wonton soup with noodles is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Good old Taiwanese grandma style cooking. Prices are very affordable. Place looks pretty worn down but that is part of its rustic charm.   The taste is not very consistent as the beef soup broth can range from mild to a little bit more strongly flavored. But it always tastes pretty good.The noodles tastes handmade so there is more of a mouth feel to them. The chicken leg tastes amazing but is a little pricey at $5 per leg. You will feel very full and satisfied with just a beef noodle bowl and chicken leg."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a quick bite to eat, craving some wonton noodle soup. I had bookmarked this place reading some other reviews, but then realized I had been here before. Almost 20 years ago. It's a faint memory now, so I can't remember if it was the same name and same people working here, yet it wouldn't surprise me. The decor since has been spruced up, but the menu seems to be pretty much intact. It was sparsely populated, maybe 7 people total.  \"I'll take a wonton noodle soup please.\"  \"Spicy or no spicy?\"  I wanted some old school wonton love, so \"Not spicy, please.\"  \"OK, no spicy. No MSG in soup!\"  \"Oh, that's great, thanks!\"  \"No MSG!!\"  I waited what seemed to be almost too long for my bowl of soup, but considering that *everything* is homemade, I'm willing to give it a pass. I did my daily Duolingo. Checked into Yelp. Checked the weather.  Then, realizing the error of having a restaurant in silence (it isn't), they turned on the music.  What follows was a veritable cavalcade of the who's who of church hymns of the Protestant faith. For better or for worse, I made a living for many years as a church musician, and, for better or for worse, I *always* pay attention to the background music people play in restaurants. Rarely is it a blessing, it's usually a curse, sometimes it's Kryptonite. Like today.  They had some sort of compilation of hymns, arranged for piano and violin, and just rattled off one well worn workhorse after another. It turned into a inescapable game of identifying them as quickly as possible. In total, I got about 2/3 of them. It was more than a distraction.  ..... \"Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee: How great Thou art....\"  Finally, the wonton noodles arrive. Everything is handmade, more home cooked than home *and* cook combined. Hand made cook hand home made cooked NO MSG.  The broth was almost like oyster sauce with water. Not very interesting, not much more than a medium to keep everything warm, sadly. No MSG.  As per Andrew C.'s review of 6/1/2016, wontons were more like dumplings. Dare I say, nay, more like PILLOWS. Texture wise, there were some off-putting Unidentified Crunchy Objects in the filling (UCOs), but flavour-wise, not bad.  Also, lettuce as a topping. *Cooked lettuce*.  I can only imagine what it's like to deal with two hungry children, particularly ones that eat their body weight in food every day. Some days, perhaps my poor Chinese mother didn't have enough time to do the grocery shopping, so our vegetable dish for dinner would consist of boiled lettuce. Motherf***ing lettuce. With a plate of oyster sauce. The water from the lettuce would turn the oyster sauce into something of a broth-like consistence. My sister and I ate it, grudgingly, while complaining. I feel guilty now for being such a bitch.  .... \"O sometimes it causes me to tremble! tremble! tremble! Were you there when they crucified my Lord?\" ....  The noodles were handpulled, so there's that. But noodles without a good broth become wet dough-strings in brown water. Accompanied with cooked lettuce. Romaine, I think. In a broth that tastes vaguely of oyster sauce. And guilt.  There's a small plate of almond cookies. These definitely look home made. You can still see the dimples made from the hands and fingers that made them. Like the way a sculptor creates life from the basest clay. I don't usually like them, because they tend to be too sweet, and crumble in your mouth into dust. These are definitely not too sweet, perhaps not sweet enough. But they do not disappoint in the crumbly, dusty category.  I finish my meal. I'm chock full of pork pillows. And wet dough-strings. I rise up from my seat to pay.  \"OK thank you! Broth, no MSG!!\"  Cooked lettuce.  \"Yes, thank you.\" I had over a 20, and get my change. I imagine the tip jar is like the collection plate, and I hand over my perfunctory %15 tith... tip.  Cooked. Lettuce.  ... \"Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home!\" ...."}
{"text":"Very affordable Taiwanese place. I usually get a beef dumpling soup to start ($2.99! and has about 6 well-sized dumplings) followed by a cold noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce, julienned cucumbers and chicken. Pretty much everything is tasty, just takes some getting used to if you don't usually eat Taiwanese. I also like that every dish incorporates veggies (don't be surprised if you get steamed broccoli and carrots on your plate!). The owners, especially the main lady who serves, are just so so sweet. She says \"thank you\" a million times while you're there :) She also makes a mean shortbread cookie, one of which you get at the end of your meal. The only downside is because it's such a small operation and they make your order from scratch, it takes a crazy long time to get your food usually. Expect about 30, sometimes 40 minute wait. I don't mind usually, but I will say this factor keeps me from going more regularly, since I don't always have the time/not in the mood to make a casual dinner a good 1.5 hour affair."}
{"text":"The service was good and their food tastes very homemade. My friend ordered a chicken leg and fried dumplings. On the picture it looked like a big piece, but actually she only got a drumstick for $5. The drumstick was a bit cold and burnt on one side. The fried dumplings (guo tie) weren't really what we expected, they were more like small rolls got fried and were not like the dumplings I've ever seen. The chicken slices cold noodles I ordered had way to much sauce and I felt really heavy after eating them."}
{"text":"I have been eating there since I was in elementary school (now I am 20 time flies :'D) and nothing has changed: the food, the people, and the decor are still the same. The food is really like home made food, not greasy at all and the portions are fair. I love their chicken leg on rice, braised pork on rice, and wonton soup. - wonton soup: the wontons are huge, almost like dumplings. They have noodles in their wonton soup as well. The soup is tasty and doesn't overpower the wontons. Super cheap price I would say for that much food. - braised pork with rice: I like the fact that they put a lot of vegetables in the dish, just to balance the meat and vegetable ratio. The pork is a tiny bit dry but it tasted good in general. As said before, it is a super satisfying meal for $8.99. I love the fact that after eating there I don't feel like I have eaten in a restaurant, because it feels super home made and healthy (with all the vegetables). Big shout out to the home made cookies that they are giving for free. I have been obsessed with them since I was little and I still am. They are really simple cookies but taste so freaking good. I even asked for the recipe, but she is just using normal ingredients I don't know why they taste so amazing."}
{"text":"Simple but tasty. The staff are incredibly friendly and the vegetables are always fresh. They make their noodles from scratch and have three different options for the way they prepare tofu. Really nice, calm atmosphere. Also very affordable! One of my favourite downtown spots."}
{"text":"The positives: the food is cheap and good, the ladies working there are nice/friendly. However there is no air conditioning or fans so on a hot and humid summer day it's unbearable in the restaurant.   I got the G - wonton soup with noodles (c$8.99). Portion size was ample. Noodles appear to be hand pulled in house. Soup broth taste was OK but nothing special. The wontons were different but delicious. They are definitely homemade and lool more like dumplings than wontons, which is fine. Also there seemed to be 6-8 of them in my bowl which is ample in my opinion.  I debated if I should get just the wonton soup for c$4.99 (w/o noodles). Probably should have gotten it since the noodles were not worth the additional c$4. Also there is American green kale in the noodles - never seen that before.   Service is slow given limited number of workers."}
{"text":"When I think of Wonton soup I immediately think about this place. Run by a senior lady, she puts all her magic to prepare everything themselves at the place, wontons and noodles are made by them, they taste so natural and fresh. The soup is amazing, all the ingredients are so fresh, love it.   The place itself isn't something fancy, more like a traditional one where people living in the area stop to gather and grab something to eat, probably most of them students. But you will get the family treatment, a warm welcome, a smile and the feeling that grandma is taking care of you. While waiting for the food, you will be offered green tea."}
{"text":"One of my favourite hidden gems. Mommas hand made noodles, I suggest home style beef or one of their soups. Payment is cash but you will smile as you close your bill.  Food:  9/10 Service:  8/10 - missing utensils, delayed service made me miss happy hour Price:  7/10 Atmosphere:  7/10 - TVs had nothing on, could of at least had the hockey game on mute"}
{"text":"Where have you been all my life? I just found this place though I passed by it a million times, I finally made it in. And it..... was amazing. This basically feels like you're in the dining room of a Chinese mama and they make your dumplings by hand when you order. Did you hear me, made when you order dumplings. Now, I was in a rush I only had 15 minutes between meetings, so I just tried a $5 bowl of 5 wontons and I really enjoyed it. Four stars, you ask... Well I need to go back and try more things and then maybe my review will change to 5 stars. But for now this is a definite must try if you're into wontons and if especially you like restaurants where you feel like a mama or papa is cooking for you. The quaintness of the two Chinese ladies in the kitchen whipping up these amazing wontons is most definitely part of the experience... But you got to like that. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They were very sweet but we got three dishes and none of them were good. The beef dishes tasted really hamburger-y. Dumplings with peanut sauce are always good but not here."}
{"text":"Food is overly light-seasoned. Maybe that's the Taiwan flavour? Great service, clean and spacious place."}
{"text":"Really homey Taiwanese food, with an emphasis on freshness, designed to be a bit healthier than your usual Chinese food.  This place is run by the nicest people. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, it's not fancy at all, but it's a nice place to grab very home-made kind of Chinese food, that's like something a mom/aunt/grandma would make. Plus the prices are very reasonable.  They tell you right off the bat that there's a bit of a wait because they make your food fresh, to order, but the wait isn't really long at all, unless they're packed that night. They make healthier versions of Taiwanese food. For example, their stewed pork rice is made with leaner ground pork, instead of traditional pork belly, and they include a lot of vegetables on the side (without skimping on the meat). I also enjoy their wontons. Because they don't use msg and they don't oversaturate everything with salt, the flavours are more subtle but in my opinion, still very good.  I often come here when I'm in town, especially when I don't want to wait in line at Ganadara!"}
