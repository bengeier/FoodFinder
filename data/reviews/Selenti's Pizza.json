{"text":"I was tired of soggy crust pizza from marcos dominos and pizza hut so i tried selentis in lorain. I was blown away by how good it is. The crust is cooked throughly; its crunchy and delicious. When entering their restaurant i also noticed its clean; the floors counter top etc, this is a big plus for me. I just found my new fav pizza joint in lorain. Tried the large deluxe and taco pizza and was not disappointed; also got bags of cookies while waiting and are also very good."}
{"text":"Selenti's always brings so much happiness to mind , I grew up on the west side and have always enjoyed the nights growing up when my parents would order selenti's! I'm in DC now , but I just told my mother to plan on making a trip back out to Lorain when I visit in October. A true local business and delicious pizza joint ! I wouldn't take my business anywhere else for pizza in the lorain county area."}
{"text":"Pizza.  It's written in my DNA...

THE UP-SIDE:  At three months old, I was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that requires a constant influx of pizza pie to keep me alive.  Selenti's offers your standard pizza shop selection, along with some Italian dinner choices.  The pizza is always good, and the fried eggplant slices work surprisingly well as a pizza topping.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  The other dinner selections are... inconsistent.  I've had some good pasta from them and some that was just so-so.  

THE SUM-IT-UP:  Look, it's a neighborhood pizza place that makes good pizza, and occasionally offers some other solid choices.  This isn't high-end, but it is definitely one of the nicer pizza shops in the area, with some good pizza.  

...and \"good\" is all I require to stave off my genetic, pizza deficiency disorder.  :-)"}
{"text":"great, dependable neighborhood pizza joint. Super for \"I don't want to cook tonight\" nights. Our go to pizza place. Thrilled that they are still serving the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I moved to Lorain almost 2 years ago, this place I see every day and always wanted to try! It's amazing! Nice and crisp, yummy, definitely a fan for life!"}
{"text":"Omg....haven't had Selenti's pizza since '76!!
It was excellent today, THE BEST dough, can't wait to try their sub sandwiches. Ok, I was weak and bought Rich's, the owner, homemade chocolate chip cookies. YUMMY, u must try them, I'm not a \"cookie\" person, but Selenti's has converted me. Great food! And an absolutely wonderful menu!"}
{"text":"There are many pizza places in Lorain, Ohio. Thankfully we have quite a few independently owned pizza joints so we don't have to suffer through the typical, cookie-cutter chains. Selenti's is definitely my favorite small-town pizza joint located in Lorain. Their pizza is delish! I am a huge fan of getting their breaded eggplant as a topping. 

If you call in an order to pick up the average wait time is 30 minutes. Their prices are very reasonable and the service is always pleasant and helpful. Selenti's is strictly a to-go pizza place as they do not have a dining room. Located on a very well-lit portion of Oberlin Avenue. I know their location may be a turn off to some folks, but I have never had any safety issues at this location and am never afraid to go get my pizza after-dark. Well-lit parking is located right outside their front door on the southbound side of Oberlin Avenue. 

Give them a shot! Selenti's Pizza will not let you down!!!"}
{"text":"I work close to here so it's convenient to stop in for lunch and get the piece of pizza slices they offer them for two dollars a piece or two for 3.50. I love the homemade cookies and brownies too and usually end up buying a bag of chips to go with my pizza! When I get back to work everybody wants my pizza!"}
{"text":"The sauce here is garbage. Who the heck puts fistfulls of onion in pizza sauce?  Combine that with rude staff and the risk of rape you run if you pick up your pizza and Selenti pizza is a no go. This place is not worth spit."}
{"text":"Been going to Selenti's since 1981 and have never been disappointed until last Friday 12/19.  Had people to the house and we got a few Ham, Cheese and Pepperoni subs.  The subs were nowhere near the quality that they have been in the past.  The amount of the ingredients seemed to have been reduced by over half and the bun seems as though it was under baked.  Sadly after over 30 years of doing business with Selenti's I doubt if I will be going back as it was that disappointing."}
