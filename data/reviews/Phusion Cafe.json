{"text":"waited for 40 minutes. food was average and bubble tea was too sweet. Dining space is too small and parking is difficult to find during peak hours."}
{"text":"So nice on a cold winter day. I was not sure what to expect as I had not tried Taiwanese food before. Very comforting food with a uniquely different taste and presentation. Clevelanders are lucky to have this kind of  food diversity. Service is with a smile and prices are more than reasonable. I am excited to try the menu on future visits."}
{"text":"Love their beef noodle and braised pork over rice!! Yum!! Everything on the menu are very reasonably priced. They also have amazing bubble milk tea!!! Great food, great price. They also deliver. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"5 stars for having good affordable Taiwanese food in Cleveland.  Got Beef Noodle Soup, Salt and Pepper Pork, Fried Chicken with Basil, and Bamboo with Soy Bean Sauce.  The place has a hole in the wall type ambiance, but I think that is part of the charm. Got boba tea towards closing time and tapioca were inconsistent.  Definitely a significant departure from the normal Cleveland Asian food mold and worth a visit."}
{"text":"Excellent beef soup noodles. Delicious, rich-tasting broth. I never expected to get such authentic Taiwanese style niu rou mian in Cleveland! The scallion pancakes and pot stickers and three cup chicken were also delicious. The Hakka stir fry, with dried tofu strips, celery, and squid, was also tasty--but probably less to the taste of most diners. 

Very pleasant and helpful service as well. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food and service prices are very good. Only draw back is the dining room could be a little more desirable. However the food more than makes up for the lack of ambience."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here like 4 times now and I've loved it every time ! We did pick up tonight instead of delivery and it was so cute ! The staff was very friendly and efficient ! Love this place"}
{"text":"My favorite is braised pork with rice and egg, and the fry pot sticker. Good portion and reasonable price. Only thing I wish it could be better/improved is the ambience of the place."}
{"text":"It's a must visit place in Cleveland!!! The food here is as good as those Taiwanese restaurant in LA!! We ordered Hakka slats, chicken legs rice, large intestine, and salty crisp chicken. Everything is perfect:)"}
{"text":"Best Taiwanese food in CLE 
Great food great service
Love this place the service here is really awesome. They are really nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"very good taste and very good service?strongly recommend the bubble tea and pork rice."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious here. I have been in Cleveland for half year, and this is the best place to eat"}
{"text":"Finally, a Taiwanese place in Cleveland! Giving it four stars instead of five only because the service was on the slow side and I think some of the dishes did trend towards the salty side. I bought the lu rou fan (pork belly with rice), which I really don't think you can find anywhere else in the city. It tasted authentic and was well-priced. My friend ordered the spicy fish filet, which was definitely quite salty. The bamboo with garlic sauce was surprisingly tasty, as the bamboo was sautéed well (and believe me, I usually hate bamboo) and the sauce was very flavorful. Even if you don't like bamboo, I might consider this dish.

Overall, while the food trended towards salty, this is a pretty authentic Taiwanese food experience that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had the Taiwanese sausage fried rice and I loved it. The seasoning was perfect. Not too salty and had just great flavor in it. Can't remember what my friends got but they all looked yummy. Will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"On our way to Superior Pho when we saw signs for Taiwanese Beef Noodle soup--had never heard of Phusion Cafe (perhaps b/c we always enter for Pho in the back?).  Had to try it, since my wife had visited Taiwan and wanted to compare.  For us, the immediate draw was the Taiwanese selection of menu items.

The food: My wife loved the Beef Noodle soup--hearty and delicious, even with the regular (not homemade) noodles.  We also ordered the pot stickers--and these we DID take the homemade over the standard.  They were large and delicious.  For $1 more, you get 6 if you get the homemade and 7 if you just order the regular.  We also looked on to other tables near us and the variety of dishes looked just as pleasing as ours.  Crowd was a mix of students and others who, like us, were in the building for Pho and found this gem instead.  Great, different flavors.  Only the Asia Town Center can compete with such a variety of cuisines in one building.

The service: Here's where we think they could improve.  The staff and our server were delightful and eager to please.  But they seemed a little green at basic service organization.  I still think this place deserves 5 stars and have complete confidence the staff will get more organized.  There seemed to be miscommunication between the staff handling take-out orders and serving sitting customers.

Also, I would recommend all servers be able to explain the very unique Taiwanese dishes (both prep and flavors)--they feature \"Hakka-style\" Taiwanese dishes but our server seemed unsure what that meant.  If that's your featured dish in your menu, you should be able to talk it up and sell it.  

No one \"wanders\" into the 3030 Superior building...everyone entering this most nondescript building is there b/c they know amazing food is inside.
Especially b/c this little eatery is now competing with 2 additional \"Asian\" restaurants in the building, I'd keep emphasizing your Taiwanese dishes and very sweet, pleasant service.

Put your homemade noodle and dumpling options on the menu, too!
We'll be back--glad to have your food in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Very excited about this new openning! Authentic Taiwanese food -- the food quality easily beats the popular Taiwanese restaurants.

Convenient parking and easy highway access as well."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Taiwanese place and found Phusion Cafe!! I am a noodle enthusiast and the handmade beef noodle soup was amazing! Great flavor and color! Also got the Crab Rangoon which turned out to be excellent and a great appetizer. If you're in Cleveland give this gem a shot!"}
{"text":"Great food, and service, thanks! Tasted fresh and will be back soon !"}
{"text":"Delicious Taiwanese food, just like in Taiwan!   Very friendly and attentive staff.

Tip - ask for the handmade fried dumplings (???? Shug?ng ji?n jio), they're not on the printed menu, just a sign in Chinese on the wall.   Who knows what other secret treasures await!"}
{"text":"Overrated. We got several dishes one of which was pork and squid. There were no squid to be found in that dish at all. All four of our dishes liked the same which should not be the case. The flavored were just ok. I've eaten in Hong Kong and Singapore. Have had much better even locally. I may come back to try a soup noodle."}
{"text":"I've been twice both times it was awesome. Fast and very friendly staff. I love the setup. Food is great too."}
{"text":"Have gotten take out several times this summer.   Everything we have tried has been very good, and the portions are huge for the price.   Only thing we did not really enjoy was a tofu-based entrée (because they were out of pork that night).  Not great.   Otherwise, the Beef Satay is excellent, as are any number of options you can try."}
{"text":"Literally threw it all out after taking one bite out of it each. Can taste the cheap oil that permeates the food. ordered the mapa tofu, general tso, and vegetable roll. Tasted so gross even with a starving stomach"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant!!! The food is delicious and service very nice. Suitable for students and families! Will come here again"}
{"text":"ZERO stars!!! We ordered delivery that was over an hour late and our order was wrong (included shrimp, which my friend was allergic to).  We called to complain and the manager was really rude!   The food that was right did not taste very good.  NEVER again!"}
{"text":"A little taste of home. 
We tried the scallion pancake, beef noodle soup, stir fried cabbage, and minced meat with rice. They were all delicious!"}
{"text":"My friend and stopped there for lunch.  We ordered a popcorn chicken, porkchop with rice and noodle with mushroom.  We considered order a jasmine green milk tea to share ( since it is too heavy for lunch).  The owner came out and told us that they can prepare hot or cold according on what we want, he also split the bubble tea for us.  The green tea was nice, no too sweet.

We didn't have to wait long for our lunch.  The popcorn chicken was great, crispy and tasty; it was quite big portion for appitizer.  My noodle soup had a nice aroma smell and taste delicious.  However, it was so big and I cannot finish it.  My friend had porkchop on rice and the pork was crispy and tasty.

The service was good, they packed the food for us to go.  The price was so affordable.   I will defitnitely go back to try another dish."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant with a couple seats. The owners are so friendly and cute- they're so welcoming and it's pretty hard to see that these days. 

Popcorn chicken is good! Potions are pretty big and crispy. 
I don't recommend getting the beef noodles- it's a bit bland and it just tastes like eating plain noodles.. but maybe I didn't wait enough for the flavor to soak in?"}
{"text":"Great little, under appreciated restaurant.  The peddler noodles were somewhat plain and more like a soup than noodles with sauce.  The spicy beef noodle soup was spot on.  The original bubble tea was also very good."}
{"text":"Really great food. Reminds me of my mom's cooking! Well spiced and a menu nice selection. I only wish they had better explanations of each dish since I'm not able to read Chinese. That said, we will be back - often :)"}
{"text":"Tried this out tonight,  not sure we have the same flavors in mind but,  not the worst ever. 
General Tso 's chicken: Very fatty dark meat,  unable to eat about 1/3of out. Asked for mild and got what I ordered. The sauce was just kind of bland and tasted a bit burnt.

Fried rice (side) : Decent  but,  no vegetables at all.

Teriaki chicken stix: Came deep fried,  no sauce on it with a shot of Siracha sauce,  not at all appetizing.  I drowned it in the Generals sauce just to try it,  still very tough threw out two sticks to Co worker. 

Crab Rangoon : Everybody has their own recipe  and we do not see eye to eye on this one.  Sweet yet filled with diced onions,  specs of imitation crab.  Not horrible. 

Overall I don't believe that I will order here again. But,  the food was not horrible our overall bad just not for me.  I'm accustomed to Fairlawn House Of Hunan or Main Wok."}
{"text":"Very good food. Pretty authentic taste, noodles and dumplings were made in house, fair portions. My parents approved, and they normally don't give a ish about anything."}
{"text":"Went back for bubble tea and ended up ordering food too. Had the pickle pork intestine...  I was told I was the first American customer to order it. The dish tasted much better than I thought it would. I really like the pickle.

The service was really good too! Safe to say the Phusion Cafe will be a regular stop for me whenever I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been there three times and I'm pretty satisfied with this place each time. I tried to order different things to see if every dish is good. They all are delicious. I ordered Taiwanese sausage fried rice, squid with satay sauce, and mix vegetables with garlic. They made me miss home. People and the services are very nice too. Recommend."}
{"text":"I came back here with a big group of friends to try more food. First off, the service here is pretty lousy. I don't think it's necessarily a function of apathy or incompetence, but rather that they are understaffed for the unexpected popularity they are now enjoying. So people looking for waiter/waitress jobs, please apply for this place haha. We had to ask for utensils, bowls, cups, water multiple times. My friend's appetizer came out last after all the entrees, two other dishes were really late, etc. Also, they forgot to include the tax on our bill, so they gave us another bill for the tax. Unfortunately, I realized after we left (calculated it myself) that they definitely overcharged us for tax, maybe close to 2x the actual amount. By then it was too late to go back and my party definitely didn't care. 

Onto the food: 

Beef noodle soup - excellent, like before
??? (braised pork rice) - definitely wary about this one considering how bad China Sea Express screwed it up but...wow it was really good! Got the egg and taste just right
Hakka dried bean curd - I thought the bean curd itself was a tad bland
Hakka squid and pork - this was the favorite dish of a couple of my friends, I thought it was very good, could have used more squid though. It has bean curd too, just a heads up, in case you don't want too many bean curd dishes haha. 
??? (three cup chicken) - another Taiwanese dish, this involves a sauce with 1:1:1 ratio of soy sauce, sesame oil, and cooking wine, + basil. The sauce was very good, but a couple of the pieces of chicken had no meat, just fat and connective tissue. I personally like this dish with a stronger basil flavor (i.e. more leaves), but that's just me. Overall pretty good
Singapore rice noodle (??) - I've never had ?? with such a strong curry flavor, definitely unique. I guess in the end I liked it
Salt and pepper fish - no issues here, though I've heard it's pretty hard to screw this dish up 

So in summary...
No self-respecting self-labeled \"Taiwanese\" restaurant should screw up beef noodle soup or braised pork rice, and this one nails those two dishes convincingly. The other food is overall very good as well, and good prices. Service needs a lot of work, and hopefully this will improve with time. Maybe avoid Phusion Cafe during the weekend dinner rush for now. 

I think I'll be back for the beef noodle soup and/or braised pork rice, and definitely once they start trying any Taiwanese street food and breakfast."}
{"text":"My whole family LOVES this place! The food and service and amazing. The second time we came the waitress remembered us immediately and was great, she even remembered the table we sat at! My daughter hasn't stopped talking about this restaurant for weeks and constantly asks to go back because she loves the food so much. Our favorite dishes that we're tried so far are the Hakka style tofu and the eggplant with garlic sauce but everything is really good. My husband and son are huge fans of the five spice duck. This restaurant has quickly become our favorite restaurant in Cleveland."}

{"text":"The stewed pork belly here is really fantastic. Probably the best thing on the menu. If they could figure out their myriad service issues (including customer names on the tickets would be a great first step if they still haven't started doing that), they would be in really great shape. 

Overall, solid Asian food for an area that needs it."}
{"text":"The boss is really Taiwanese and the food is very local Taiwanese food. You Must go to the Phusion Cafe if you want to try real Taiwanese food, such as beef noodle, fry pork chop and three cap chicken. Those are so delicious and famous food in Taiwan."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find a new Phusion Cafe location in the Uptown/University Circle area!

This is a small cafe right across the street from the Cleveland Institute of Art, serving Taiwanese-style Night Market food (I.e. popcorn chicken, fried meats and ribs, egg rolls, scallion pancakes, potstickers, etc) as well as main course dishes like noodle soups, rice bowls, and sandwiches/crepes. They also provide what seems like unlimited combos of boba - just take a look at that elegantly organized menu written on the wall! 

Set up like a true night market stall, this cafe can seat around 16 people (perhaps 20 if you squish). Prices are reasonable - most noodles are less than $10, and most appetizers are less than $6. If you go for the Hakka style meats, those are about $13. There are so many things to try, so don't be shy about asking the owner for some recommendations or peeking over at what the table next to you is eating. 

For starters, I recommend trying the Taiwanese popcorn chicken for a good crunch (red sauce could maybe use an extra spice kick), and the Beef Noodle soup, with a Passion Fruit Bubble Tea (+lychee jelly) to balance the savory with sweet. From there, adventure on with your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Excellent tofu dishes. Loved the dish with pickled vegetables and beef. The teriyaki chicken was more expected faire, but still delicious. Bubble tea is good. Don't get the seaweed salad. It wasn't the best. But the service was extremely nice. Our server knew the menu extremely well and steered us towards excellent choices. Big servings -- we had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day -- and it's a nice place to go and share. I wish there was a 4.5 option, because it was excellent."}
{"text":"Five visits, two stars.  Here why:

First visit - the owner was here and greeted us.  He went over in detail how he gets locally sourced meats and uses organic ingredients.  Sounded great. I ordered the Hakka Tofu and was extremely impressed.  I loved everything about this place.  Gave it a 5 star review on Yelp that night.

Second visit - I liked my dish so much I came back a few days later and ordered it for takeout.  While I am waiting they offered me some hot tea (this is important for the fifth visit).  I asked if they charged for that and they said no because they always give hot tea.  Got the Hakka Tofu home and immediately noticed it didn't have all those tasty basil leaves in it like before.  It wasn't horrible but didn't taste nearly as good as the first time.

Third visit - dined in and ordered my Hakka Tofu again and mentioned how the last time I got it for takeout and it didn't have the basil leaves.  They apologized and made me a plate.  The leaves were there but it was so extremely salty it was difficult to enjoy.  I am a saltaholic and this was too much for me.

Fourth visit - yes still coming back even though the last two times were disappointing.   Ordered the Hakka Tofu and while I am waiting the waitress asks if I want water or hot tea.  I ask if the tea is extra and she says no and we will always offer you tea.  This time the Hakka Tofu was every bit as good as it was on my first visit.  I love this place again.

Fifth visit - it went so well last time I am back.  I ordered my Hakka Tofu.  It took a few times because the waiter did not understand English.  I pointed to the item on the menu and he want back to place the order.  As he came to the table with water I asked if I could have hot tea.  Didn't quite understand at first but finally got it and said he thinks it's extra.  I mentioned to him that every time I ate there it was offered for free.  He apologized and let me know it was his first day and he would check.  A few minutes later an old European lady who spoke less English than he did brings the tea and I asked her if it was extra.  She didn't understand at first and finally said yes it was extra.  I let her know it had always been offered for free.  She just walked away. 

That was it.  I got my coat and left.  Didn't even wait for my meal.  

This place has the potential to be the best Asian restaurant in Cleveland.  If you manage to time it just right and show up when the owner is there you will love this place.  If he's not there just leave.  The place is poorly run and the food sucks if he's not there.  What a shame..."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! My mom grew up in Taiwan so I ate a lot of Taiwanese food as a kid. It is so nice to be able to have this cuisine in Cleveland now. If you are unfamiliar with Taiwanese food, let the waitress make some recommendations and start with that (for example braised pork over rice or beef noodle soup). Those are really standard Taiwanese dishes. The restaurant is operated by a husband and wife team; the wife waits the tables and she is so sweet! She remembered that I speak Chinese (badly) and always speaks to me in Chinese now, which is really nice :) go check this place out with an open mind! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Hakka style sautéed pork and squid
Scallion pancake
Three cups chicken
Ginger beef
Pork with preserved vegetables are great!"}
{"text":"$8 delivery charge. Beware.  They don't mention it at all over the phone which is illegal and try to screw you when they show up at the house. DON'T ORDER DELIVERY or don't even give them any business to a shady establishment like this. They just called just now saying , oh sorry that was a mistake after i told them i am gonna put this on yelp. Trying to screw people over.  What a joke. 
You guys need to be out of business"}
{"text":"came back here several times since my initial 4 star review and one time we saw bugs crawling on the separating half wall. Never came back since and never will. this place just doesnt give a clean feel. Please update and clean your restaurant.

This place has good food at times and can potentially be one of the better asian restaurants in the area if they manage it right."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and good authentic Chinese food. Sustained me for a couple weeks before exams. The tea part of the bubble tea is great and better than the other options in Uptown. However, the boba is consistently hard. 
Would not recommend the smoothies though--they have an odd blender like metallic taste."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my family to try this hot new place that everyone has been talking about. I've been dying for a place that serves classic Taiwanese food in Cleveland.  Overall I was pleased but not blown away. 

The good: really nice owners, wonderful beef noodle soup (some of the best I've had), deeeeelicious boba tea, generous with the rice, great prices, good service.  Loved the very traditional pork belly with pickled vegetables.  

The bad: definitely very whole in the wall decor, which appears to still be under construction.  Didn't like the tilapia in the salt and pepper fish, it was muddy tasting. The 3 cup chicken would have been delicious if it had been more strongly flavored or perhaps more salty. 

I definitely plan to come back to try more dishes, I suspect that there is much more to discover here. Get the beef noodle soup- you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Yesterday I ate the Noodles with Soybean paste (????and it was very delicious. The noodles were a perfect texture and the sauce was not too dry or too oily.  The service was prompt and my waitress was very friendly. She was attentive and was quick to fulfill all my requests. 

The next time I come I will bring some of my friends and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I am baffled by the good reviews. We got food to go. No sauces for meals, no condiments at all. The beef noodle I got tasted old and was VERY greasy. The meat was all gristle. Never again."}
{"text":"Good clean food, you won't be disappointed. Start off with the popcorn chicken, best you'll have around here. The sesame chicken was amazing, so was the braised pork"}
{"text":"The owner is always welcoming and nice. Their food is absolutely well above average considering the price. Food is usually ready instantly which is very convenient for lunch during weekdays."}
{"text":"My brother and I really liked the Taiwanese sausage fried rice, and he boba tea was really sweet, so I really liked this place overall, and the crispy chicken was really good."}
{"text":"The service was great and they really treat customers here like guests they want to make sure are taken care of. The menu is extremely extensive and definitely has something for everyone. The food is fairly priced and tasted fantastic. We had egg rolls, scallion pancake, tofu BBQ, and general tao's. Not only were the portions plentiful, but we had to bring some of it home with us. 

Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for too long for a restaurant in Cleveland that serves authentic Taiwanese food and I am so glad this place open up. I tried their three cup chicken, beef noodle soup, soy paste noodles, and a stir fry dish. Everything was satisfactory and the portions are good. Maybe I am used to super authentic Taiwanese food, somehow I feel there could be more flavor to the three cup chicken and the beef noodle soup. Other than that the food really is quite Taiwanese and I'd definitely go back many more times! Good price as well. 

Con: Make sure you are very clear when you order food, the waitress got our food wrong couple times and forgot to put down what we ordered the 2 times I went."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Cleveland, and by far the best places to get some Taiwanese cuisine. Great amount of food for the price. I had the fish in chili oil, eggplant, and pork belly. Will be coming again to have more!"}
{"text":"Finally an authentic Taiwanese restaurant in town!!! We walked in the restaurant at around 8:50 pm and they still let us in which is awesome 'cause we were STARVING. We ordered ??? (three cup chicken) and ????beef in satay sauce) and both were really good. We love the sauce of the chicken (a little too much bone for me to handle) and the beef is just soft and tender. Price is very reasonable and dishes are very homie style. Will definitely be back soon to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"A small place that my mom and I had seen a few times but we'd always been distracted by the Korean restaurant and Superior Pho. 

I love this place! The owner is so friendly, and he was very helpful and hospitable. The food came out pretty quickly, and it was all so good. We ordered the beef noodle soup and the pork chop noodles. My mom makes a mean beef noodle soup, and this was definitely on par with hers. The meat was super tender, the soup was very flavorful. The handmade noodles are so, so good, and even though it costs a tiny bit more, I highly recommend it -- it's so worth it. I loved the pork chop noodle soup too! The pork chop wasn't breaded before it was deep fried, which I always like more than the breaded and then deep fried approach. The noodle soup that went with it was very simple and complemented the pork well. 

Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????lala????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Cleveland, I hate you.

Let me explain. Five years ago, I was warned by someone that decent Asian food did, in fact, exist in Cleveland, but there was only one good one of each cuisine (i.e. one good Korean, one good Chinese, one good Vietnamese, etc.) When I moved here five years ago, I found that statement to a little exaggerated, but somewhat accurate. It was really depressing, because I grew up in an area where crab rangoon and egg foo young and chop suey were as foreign as the foreign language movies section as my local library.

Over the years, Cleveland got more Chinese restaurants. Legit ones. In fact, now, I can claim that there are 4-5 Chinese restaurants I frequent in Asiatown, all different subtypes of Chinese cuisine. 

So why do I hate Cleveland? I'm moving in two weeks. Just as more and more great Asian restaurants pop up in Cleveland....thanks.

So after seeing the strong reviews on Yelp, I had to go check out this place myself. The name doesn't exactly inspire confidence (ehhhh...fusion food...). Like others have mentioned, the space is a little odd, as though the restaurant is in the lobby of a building and you need to walk through it to get to the other end. There are about 8 tables, plus others on the other side of this \"wall\" that I'm not sure whether it's is part of the restaurant. It's a mom-and-pop restaurant, which I love supporting. I overheard one of the chefs/waitresses saying she was helping her brother out at the store. Awesome.

Got a beef noodle soup (?????) and a regular milk tea (??). Steaming hot and huge portions--I almost couldn't finish it and I'm a pretty big eater. At least 5 large pieces of braised beef and lots of bok choy that was fresh and crisp, not soggy or wilted. Noodles were abundant and chewy, but not house-made. The soup was on point, definitely one of the best I've had. Taiwanese-style beef noodle soup is basically my favorite dish in the world. Even the green onions were fragrant and crisp! (this restaurant should use them and make green onion pancakes!!) You know that if I'm praising something as silly as green onions that this place must be awesome.

The milk tea was all right. Maybe it's because I waited until the ice melted so it was a bit diluted. But you know what that means?

Means I have to go back again before I move. :D"}
{"text":"The food is so tasty! I usually order my favorite from them, the salt and pepper fish, but I love their noodle dishes as well! It's been a while since I've been to Taiwan but this always makes me feel like I'm back there! The boss is super nice as well!"}
{"text":"Rough, real rough. Had to talk the lady through the pick up order. Ok, maybe she's having a bad day, is rattled and has language differences. Then we get there she has our food in hand but instead of handing it over she puts it down walks 8ft over to the register where we are and we pay. She doesn't tell us it's our food. We're waiting and waiting. She asks can I help you? Oh so the bag you set away from us is our food? Alright. I get home and the spring rolls are instead deep fried egg rolls. The steamed pot stickers are bad. The dough is falling apart, wet and taste off. Wonton soup fine, egg rolls subpar. It's only a 9 dollar meal but why is everything so wrong with it?"}
{"text":"Super awesome place! One of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland! Last time I ordered ??? and ?????. When the food came into my mouth, it is really enjoyable. Surely I will come often."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Cleveland had Taiwanese food... Not Thai food, Taiwanese.  There may have been others, but the one I remember was in the complex where Han's skewer shop is now.  You could get Taiwanese beef noodles and other things, but it wasn't always open, and ... obviously it's gone.

Fast forward, the team that used to run the Chinese shop near playhouse Square opened a new location in the same complex as Superior Pho.  

How did I find this out?  

Well, my brother and I were off to get some Pho, and we saw... PHUSION CAFE.  What on earth?

THere's nothing at all in the title that suggests what it might be fusing - but a glance at the menu indicated that there were a lot of Taiwanese dishes - which warranted a much closer look.

How close?

Well, two people ordered 4 entrees -

Hakka style dried bean curd
Taiwanese beef noodle
Taiwanese sausage fried rice
Braised bean curd. 

All were good, authentic, and, with exception of the braised bean curd, unavailable at other venues in Cleveland.  The bean curds were very fresh - and the braised version was very crispy on the surface, something that isn't always managed correctly.  Ideally, it should be moist within, with only the surface seared.  They know what they're doing.

I'm half Hakka, so getting the dried bean curd sauté was also quite a treat.

Fried rice and noodles are standard fare, but well executed.

So - how do you spread the word?

Get a party together... 

The next day, a party of 28 descended upon Phusion Cafe, and they served buffet style Taiwanese Beef Noodles, Beef Sauce Rice (This sounds nasty, but is actually divine.) Hakka styled pork belly (Divine)... actually let's do this dish by dish.

Beef Sauce +Rice
This is essentially mince-meat sauce that's got flavor to die for.  You put it on your carb of choice, and eat until your belly decides to either expand, or burst - either way, you keep eating.  For all of those with a weakness for carbs+meatsauce, try using Quinoa instead.  I love this combo.

Hakka Pork Belly - (MeiCaiKouRou/?????
Another tremendous Hakka dish seasoned with Chinese Mustards and soy sauce that is stewed until the flavors permeate deeply, leaving the gastronomist oh-so-much to taste and savor.

Had fish cakes, beef noodles and a number of other dishes on the menu, all of which were satisfying.

On the down side:
The space is odd, since it forms almost an antechamber for the rest of the building - walking through one restaurant to get to another is a bit different.  I also don't know what the decor will ultimately look like, but the current setup remains unusual.

Interesting tidbit-
They have a brunch menu that looks positively hipster with bulgar wheats, yogurts and the like.  Haven't tried it, but maybe this is the fusion.

Another interesting tidbit -
Word is, they will start serving Taiwanese Breakfast during weekends.
That's HOT.

Word to the wise:
If you come here, I suggest a deep foray into the Taiwanese dishes.  It's their specialty, and for now, it's a cleveland Monopoly.

Play ball!"}
{"text":"Great start to a new Taiwanese (not Thai) cafe! To me, it feels like home.

My hubs and I were so happy to find this place. It's our roots, you know. We were so happy that we went back 2 days in a row! 

It's currently really the only Taiwanese-style restaurant in Cleveland! 

We tried:
- Hakka style pork and squid with vegetables
- Beef noodle soup (!!! on point)
- Mei Cai Ko Rou (stewed fatty pork belly)

The flavor is on point and it reminds us of home. The beef noodle soup is a must try. EDIT: Hakka style pork and squid is FAST becoming a favorite. Everything else was great too! Other dishes that we've tried - salt & pepper pork - not oily with perfect tenderness.

In addition, it was VERY affordable. 

Finally, they have TEN REN TEA! It's a legit tea shop in Taiwan. The Phusian Cafe owners are friends with the Ten Ren folks in Taiwan, so their milk tea is a must try. (Their fruity ones are more sugary, fyi...)

As for environment, the place has just opened up and it's more cafe style/casual. I loved that they were playing R&B/soul/hip hop. One of the Taiwanese restaurant owners used to cook soul food :D 

We can't wait to go back. If you're looking for something new for Asian food - try Phusian Cafe!"}
{"text":"Took two hours to get here bland gave me the wrong change back and said there's nothing they can do. Rude and unprofessional to top it all off."}
{"text":"Very authentic Taiwanese food. Worthy to try. Taiwanese beef noddle soup is the best. Beef is tender, broth is tasty."}
{"text":"What an experience... 
The service was truly awful. I will not lie, they did try their best to be accommodating, but failed miserably. I waited over half an hour for my salmon soba, where there were four employees in total who could not get to it. The whole waiting time consisted of each employee mentioning the words salmon soba on average of 4x PER PERSON. It was interesting to see how other people who came in after myself, retrieved their orders quickly. I also ordered the scallion pancake which came out in a timely manner. I enjoyed eating this while waiting for my entree to come out. After my salmon soba arrived, one of the cooks asked if I wanted sauce for my scallion pancake which I was already finishing up. He apologized, but at that point and time there was nothing that could be done. I have no idea as to why it took so long for my bubble tea to be made, another employee waited until the last minute to make me one which only took her two minutes to make. I had the strawberry bubble tea, which I did not enjoy (but I am particular about my bubble tea). 
Other notes: seating is rough as they're are two long tables available with one small circle table by the restroom, so for those not comfortable with sitting next to a stranger, maybe this place is not for you. Water is self-serving and available (no ice, just water). They also ran out of chopsticks.. 
I would only come back for the scallion pancake, I did really enjoy that."}
{"text":"We ordered several different dishes to be delivered to our hotel and felt safe in doing so after reading the reviews which sounded pretty good.  Unfortunately, it looks like we should have ordered elsewhere.  Our $50+ order was delivered to the wrong hotel even though the name and address was clearly shown on the receipt.  Even after notifying the delivery person and Phusion Cafe of the delivery error, our food was not picked up to be brought to us.  By the time our hotel retrieved our order from where it had been delivered, the food was cold and leaking from the flimsy styrofoam containers.  Phusion Cafe said the manager would be calling us to discuss the situation, and we're hoping to hear from him/her soon because in addition to the delivery fiasco, the food was tasteless, lacked in any Asian flavor whatsoever, and some of the shrimp batter was uncooked.   Phusion Cafe, we hope to hear from you soon regarding this disappointing and unbelievable situation..."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this place.  Amazing place to get not-overly-greasy versions of your favorite Americanized Chinese foods, plus great interpretations of more authentic Taiwanese takeout items.  

I had the popcorn chicken, fried potstickers and the General Tso's chicken.  TIP: ask for the General Tso's \"really crispy\" or extra crispy...it comes out with the texture of the popcorn chicken, and then you can add extra sauce as you choose.   This is how I avoided getting whole bites of nothing but gross bread/fat, as often happens at other places.   AND, since you're bound to have leftovers, this texture is more conducive to reheating...I'm currently eating some General Tso's the day after buying it, and it didn't get gross in the microwave at all.  WOO."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers, you did it again!

Very modest place, a sort of neighborhood-ish kinda restaurant but with all the ingredients to make it a gem. I was hungry for noodles so I ordered the Taiwanese Noodle Soup with Beef. The bowl was big, everything tasted fresh and yummy. The beef was tender and delicious while the vegetables, noodles and spices blended in perfectly. Very reasonable, it's hard to find value like this out there. This was my first visit but will not be my last. Thank you Phusion Cafe for the great service as well."}
{"text":"Best Taiwanese food I've had so far in the US. Glad to find this gem in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Definitely the most authentic Taiwanese food in the region!!! The taste was just the same as my Taiwanese friend made! Will come again when I am back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Just fantastic: fresh, simple, inexpensive, and delicious. Great service, menu has photos of everything, very helpful.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to some good Taiwanese food, after reading these reviews. Unfortunately, the service was very slow and the food all tasted very mediocre. Nothing made me go \"wow I want to come back here!\". We got 3 dishes from the Taiwanese specialty menu and a some noodles."}
{"text":"I've been to Phusion's neighboring restaurant, Superior Pho, lots of times.  Also visited it's sister restaurant Phuel Café, downtown, but this was my first visit to Phusion Casfe, and I was not at all disappointed.  I visited for lunch and based on Yelp reviews, I knew that I had to order the braised pork dish over rice.  I entered the restaurant, and was seated.  I was given a Taiwanese menu as well as a American menu with pictures.  The waitress was super friendly in making sure that I was familiar with the dishes offered.  My entrée arrived a short time later.  The portion was huge.  The pork was tasty, nicely seasoned.  A first for me was the soy marinated boiled egg.  The egg was warm, just the right amount of saltiness from the soy, and a great accompaniment to the entrée.  I also had a shrimp egg roll, which was typical, nothing special.  I will absolutely return to Phusion Café."}
{"text":"I lived in Taiwan for two years and I had been CRAVING beef noodle soup like I would get in Taipei. So I ordered it at Phusion and it was top notch. Just like I was back in Taiwan. I recommend ordering it a little spicy for the full effect. I also ordered some Boba Tea to go and that was great too. I'll definitely be back for their cold noodles and hand-made scallion pancake. :)"}
{"text":"The food there is so authentic , I have had so many Hakka food before but the Hakka style food there is so original and it is one of a kind. We ordered Hakka prom ribs and Hakka style sautéed pork and squid , Hakka rice noodle , they were soooooo delicious . Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Finally some real Chinese food in town!!! It's a little bit expensive. I love the stewed pork belly!"}
{"text":"this place really has that home grown feel.
when you come here, don't expect to be eating some take out general tso's. that actually is on the menu, but prob won't be what you're expecting.
my family and i come here for all the vegetarian offerings. tofu this and tofu that. mmmmm...
a little bit inconsistent with the saltiness level but overall pretty delicious.
are they gonna start having taiwanese breakfast or what??? :D"}
{"text":"Awesome real Taiwanese fair. Great depth of flavors and many traditional favorites. It's a real treat to have this restaurant in Cleveland. One of my four goto Asian places in town. Try the pork noodle soup and add vinager for a great source taste. 

Three cups chicken is great also. If you don't like the bones, they will prepare them without. 

A must try!!!"}
{"text":"I got the squid and meatball soup with noodles. Definitely a solid choice on a cold day. The noodles are homemade and the soup has a well rounded flavor that has a little kick to it. For only $7.95 definitely worth a shot if your in the area."}
{"text":"I'll start off by being honest and saying that I was really surprised that Cleveland has decent Taiwanese food. My friends and I shared the pork with preserved vegetables(????) and popcorn chicken with basil (???). They were both prepared differently than what I'm used to but it was still good. I ordered the beef noodle soup(?????) and it was really good. I haven't had a good beef noodle soup in awhile and it definitely hit the spot (especially since it was really cold outside). My friends ordered braised pork with rice (???) and the peddler noodles (?????) and were both satisfied with their dishes as well. I would say that the peddler noodles could come in a larger bowl since my friend struggled to mix everything together. I'll probably want to come again if I'm visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to buffalo, NY. Reasonable prices, quick service, and friendly server. I loved the crunchiness and bit of chewiness in the popcorn chicken. Braised pork rice was delicious. Mango bubble tea was a bit too sweet, but the milk tea was the right amount. Yes, I'd come back."}
{"text":"Best bubble tea in Cleveland. The owner and the employees are very friendly. Totally worth the 20 minute ride."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????!??????????????????????????????!??"}
{"text":"Decent food for good price. Tried the popcorn chicken and the stewed pork belly rice bowl. The Taiwanese-styled popcorn chicken was tasty, but could have used more fresh basil. The stewed pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth tender, but the flavor was a bit mild for me. Definitely am glad this is now an option in Uptown, and can see myself coming back again!
The cafe itself, unfortunately, is very small. I'd be prepared to squeeze in for a spot or opt for ordering food to go."}
{"text":"I really like the decor and the service was very quick. Everyone was very nice and helpful. I had the five-spice duck (It was written on the chalkboard and in a written part of the menu, not sure if it's always available) and milk tea (my new favorite thing in the world). I also split the beef meatball soup with my mom. The duck is amazing, but beware: it has bones. It had all different pieces, wings, neck, and what-have you. Such a great flavor! The milk tea was fantastic, and the homemade chili oil is hot but very very good. The soup was stellar, the broth has such a deep umami flavor. It could be a meal in itself.

I don't know much about Taiwanese food, but I really love this place after one visit."}
{"text":"Doc: Unfortunately we never know when or where good Bubble Tea is going to strike.
Marty: (Pulls up the page for Phusion Cafe) We do now.
Doc: Great Scott! This is it! If we could somehow harness this Bubble Tea. Channel it into the Boba Capacitor. It just might work.
Marty: Whoa, this Bubble Tea is heavy, Doc.
Doc: Marty, next Saturday night, we're sending you Back... to the Phusion!

What to get: Any of their Bubble Teas, but order it less sweet unless it's the Milk Tea.
What not to get: ConPhused by their menu. It's pretty basic. Like your boyfriend.

How to improve: Add Brown Sugar Milk Tea to the menu!

There is some ConPhusion about what good Bubble Tea is and how important lovely service is. I'm big into Bubble Tea and I don't care too much about service as long as they get my order right. But for what it's worth, the younger girl working here (maybe the daughter of the owners?) is so friendly it hurts. Literally I get shooting pains up and down my groin area (both sides) from her obsene in-your-face bubble-tea-providing friendliness.

As for the tea itself, it might be the best Bubble Tea in the CLE, but that really isn't saying much at all because this city does not have the excellent options of nearby Pittsburgh or even Rochester, and don't get me started on the bubble tea heavens of Cali, NYC, Toronto or Houston.

It is really nice though, particularly by Cleveland standards. The milk tea is pretty basic and bland but then so is your boyfriend. It tastes good and that's what matters (unlike your boyfriend).

I've also had the Taro and Lychee which were both a bit too sweet, but can be ordered with less ice - so I suggest you do so. They were really good, though, although again - I have yet to find anything here that would make me rush back and knock over customers to demand to be served my favourite bubble tea instantly. Because that is totally my usual type of behaviour. Especially when I'm around your boyfriend.

But really, you won't get better Bubble Tea in Cleveland (I've tried them all), and the service is wonderful (if the younger girl is there, especially), so stop by Phusion and end the ConPhusion about who has The Land's best BT.

I mean, ConPhusios liked it, so it must be good. Anyway I have to go. I have to catch a lightning bolt at the clock tower so I can go back to the Phusion."}
{"text":"I'm thrilled this place is open, great taiwanese food! I would recommend the beef noodle soup, pork with preserved vegetable, and salt/pepper chicken."}
{"text":"The boss is so kind, the food is delicious that makes me miss my hometown I will come back again"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Most of our dishes were tasty. The beef in satay sauce was a little bland. Over all good experience"}
{"text":"Delicious bubble tea. Authentic Taiwanese cuisine. So sad I don't live closer. I would come here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place and had been talking about it for days. We were sorely disappointed. The bubble tea was ok but everything else about our experience was dismal. The place is way too small and the layout confusing. There are way too many options. They're trying to do way too much. I got the General Tso's tofu rice dish. Tasted ok but so over sauced that I couldn't finish the rice. The other dish was a pork belly rice meal. The rice was dry and caked and we were very unpleasantly surprised by a huge chunk of what seems to be ginger disguised as pork. Not to mention it's expensive for what it is. I wouldn't have paid even half of the price of each dish for what I got. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is really solid Taiwanese food. I like their emphasis on street food and small eats, which means that multiple items can be ordered for a full meal. Both the beef noodle soup and peddler noodles were heavy on taste and very satisfying. The broth of the former was rich and the beef was tender. The peddler noodle was more of a dry noodle with a layer of sauce on the bottom, and it mixed really well with the braised ground meat on the top. 

The setup of the inside location was a bit unconventional, but it worked. The waitress was really friendly and checked up on us enough times. Finally, the bubble tea was made well, with the right amount of sweetness and not too watery. Apparently the owners know the people associated with Ten Ren, which explains the bubble tea."}
{"text":"Have to go and try out their menu! it's really tasty and inexpensive. We went in past 9pm and they stayed open for us as well! I had the beef noodle soup as recommended by many ppl on yelp...and it was a big portion of yummyness! I couldn't finish so I gave some to my fiance. Another bonus....the servers are very sweet...they shared what their popular items were and gave us free tea:)"}
{"text":"Got the 3 cup chicken and a matcha bubble tea. Both were delicious. The boba they use in the tea is softer than I've ever tasted (in a good way). 

The owner is super nice too. I asked him why he doesn't really have many signs up since it made the place hard to find. He said it's because they share the building with other restaurants and he doesn't want to take their business. So yea, if you can't find it they share a building with a pho place and a Korean place"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  I ordered the pork belly with rice and the popcorn chicken appetizer.  Everything was well prepared and brought out quickly.   Waitress guided us on food selection to ensure that we would be satisfied. 
We drive between Philadelphia and Detroit on a regular basis...  it has been decided that we are going to stop here and eat whenever we are passing through Ohio."}
{"text":"I am so happy that authentic Chinese food is obtainable within walking distance now. I've been here twice, got the braised pork with rice and stew pork belly with rice. Both dishes were good, although I could use for more meat and less rice. They give a ridiculously large amount of rice. Also, this place is small but both times I was able to find a table. People also don't tend to stay long so you probably wouldn't have to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We tried the popcorn chicken, I've never eaten something like that before. Its definitely something worth trying. Bang for the buck. 
We also tried the \"three cups chicken\". It was very flavorful. I would definitely recommend it. Both these dishes have so much meat in them that it would suffice for two people to dine there in addition to boxing a little for home."}
{"text":"I love the food there in their old store. This one is just like that. But space is not enough. But still good for a take out"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Asian food you can get in Cleveland! They have everything ranging from tradition to modern Asian style food. Inside, the customer is greeted by great staff and a relaxing atmosphere great for the whole family. The food is without a doubt 5 star at a great price. A must go restaurant in the greater Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Sad to report that the quality of dishes have gone downhill. My insider sources told me that this place keeps change chefs all the time.

The scallion pancake was burnt outside and undercooked inside. Not to mention what used t be the magical crispness is no longer.

The \"pork steak\" appetizer ??? has become \"katsu Don\" style, heavily breaded. 

Beef noodle soup only had 3 little pieces of beef. The soup base is different too (for the worse).

I'd still come, but I don't believe I'll come as often as I used to."}
{"text":"I'm so glad this area has been converted into a new place to eat! Before it used to be a shady bar, and an area to avoid. Now the aromas cannot keep us away! Good authentic Taiwanese food with friendly service, what more can you ask for when you have these essentials. Since it was a cold day, most of us ordered the traditional beef noodle soup. The beef was very tender, which I was super happy about. The flavor of the soup base was also quite good, and not diluted down. Sadly, I've noticed other restaurants that do this to save money, lets hope they keep this dish the way it is right now- no changes need to be made! Some friends also ordered the eggplant and pork over rice dishes. Everyone seemed happy happy happy, so the food was prepared well! I of course also had to have their  boba, and was very happy with their milk tea. I think it might be my new stop whenever I'm craving for boba; hopefully they have custard etc for the drinks in the near future! For my first visit I was quite happy with the food, service, and prices. I must return to try all their Hakka dishes, being Hakka Chinese myself! The portions are quite filling for me, which is why I could not order more to try during this first visit. Great new place for CLE!"}
{"text":"You Yelpers had me really pumped for this place, but I didn't see what all of the commotion was about. I was not happy with the service, and the food was okay.

Let me start out with the basics. We were confused as to finding the place and when we got inside were were still confused on how and where to sit. For first timers: grab your menus at the door for extra time to look, or wait until you're seated for who-knows-how-long to get a menu (the people behind us had to wait about 10 minutes). walk around the strip of counter until you get someone's attention to seat you. We waited a little while for someone to come take our drink orders and then even longer for her to come back so we could order food. Actually, she took 2 tables orders before ours that arrived later than us... We almost left. I think the only reason the waitress came over was because we started pulling our wallets out to pay for the drinks.

When ordering our food, our questions were handled very well. I had a peach iced tea which was very peach-y but delicious. Not yummy enough to suck down but slowly sip. I say this because you know service is bad when you finish your drink and all the ice in it well before you get your food...

The waitress came over to tell us the kitchen was very busy but there was only one other table waiting for food besides us.

I had ordered a vegetable egg roll and vegetable mei fen (both vegetarian items). Another person in my group ordered the vegetable egg roll too, and both of them were served burnt and lacked flavor inside. Then, I was served the wrong entree and it was served to me before anyone else got their food. I was served the lo mein instead of mei fen. It was ok- barely any veggies were viable in it so I didn't see the point in having to pay extra for vegetables. My friends got orange chicken and said it was very good."}
{"text":"Phusion Cafe is a fairly new restaurant inside the 3030 Superior Ave. building that houses several different businesses. 

This is no frills, cozy dining room shop serving tasty food with friendly staff. I tried their Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup and it was delicious and quite authentic. The broth was rich and the beef was tender and savory. The noodles appears home-made but I couldn't be sure. The bowl also had some greens which accompanied the noodle and broth well.

I had the Pork Chop over rice to-go and found it a little disappointing. The pork chop was tender but the seasoning was unbalanced. They served it with half a hard boiled egg and some pickled vegetables. I think I was expecting something similar to a Vietnamese Pork Chop and rice, which it clearly wasn't. 

Overall, I will definitely return for another meal because there are other dishes that I'd love to try there."}
{"text":"I ordered from them on Grubhub. It took over 90-minutes for them to get here, and by then I had to go to a meeting and couldn't eat it. I asked for a refund, but no dice. I will not order with them again."}
{"text":"As far as I know, this and China Sea by CSU are the only Taiwanese restaurants in the northeast Ohio area. Phusion Cafe definitely delivers, with the trademark Taiwanese staples of three cup chicken, Taiwanese sausage fried rice, and Peddler noodles. Above all else, Phusion Cafe has by far the best bubble tea in Cleveland, which is to be expected considering their tea is based on TenRen Tea Time's recipes. I particularly love the lychee bubble tea, which has a very strong natural fruit flavor to it. This is THE place I go to, to satisfy my cravings for Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"Pork belly stew is the best I've found in the US. It might be a bit too greasy to some people if you are not used to greasy Chinese dishes though."}
{"text":"Why hello again, yelp.  I figured it was about time that I reviewed this place.  I was told that this was an offshoot of China Sea by CSU - run by some of the same people.  

OVERALL: 
I've been here a couple of times already.  First of all I am very, very happy that a Taiwanese cafe has come to Cleveland!  This place is not the best, but for Cleveland it's pretty good!  Try the braised pork over rice and the beef noodle soup.  The simplified Chinese does throw me off a bit.  They do not use simplified Chinese characters in Taiwan. 

SPECIFIC DISHES (best to worst):
- Braised pork with rice (rou zhao fan) - It's pretty simple - minced pork meat poured over rice as a sauce.  It's pretty authentic, but I did wish the proportion of meat to rice was greater.
- Salt and pepper fish (jiao yan yu pian) - Chunks of fried fish with salt and pepper, this was flavored perfectly! 
- Beef noodle soup (niu rou mian) - Somewhat spicy, but not overwhelming.  Beef and noodles were both on the spot.
- Pork chop over rice (zhu pa fan) - Expected the pork chop to be fried, and for the rice to have some minced pork sauce as well, so this dish felt kind of bare.  Flavored fine though.
- Taiwan peddler noodle (tai nan dan zi mian) - It was not bad, but I'm used to this dish having a tea egg, and also this one had too much vinegar and not much soup.
- They also have the Ten Ren bubble tea (I haven't tried it, but I'm guessing it's probably similar to that at China Sea).  And yes, there is a rumor that they will start serving breakfast.  We'll see if I upgrade my review a bit in the future!

SERVICE:
It's okay.  They seem a little new at this; they would bring the food without utensils; and once they forgot to bring one of our two dishes and it took them a couple of minutes with us staring at them for them to realize."}
{"text":"Oftentimes restaraunts which offer delivery need to nonetheless be visited at least once in order to understand their fundamental essence. Something is inherently lost when one merely samples the cuisine and is not able to become immersed in the decor, and/or entertained by the wait staff. This is not the case with Phusion. This spectacular (and affordable!) east side Thaiwanese cafe has been able to distill its healthy character into a few swiftly delivered clamshell take-out containers with ease and authority. The tangy sweet and sour soup,  sesame tofu, and eggplant with thyme conspire to take you on a rich, zippy, veg-heavy tour of the kitchen in which they were prepared as well as the countries from which their flavors were foraged. The creators of this cafe stress maintaining a \"proper\" ph balance in order to stay healthy, and strive to help one attain such a balance by layering their meals with just the right amount of acidic and alkaline foods. They've apparently done copious research, combining ingredients and mixing recipes from far and wide to create their dishes. And while your reviewer is admittedly no dietician, let it be said that the chefs at Phusion have apparently succeeded in creating generously-portioned meals which feel balanced and flavorful and super filling, but with no troubling post-meal bloat to speak of. The eggplant is soft, but not squishy. The tofu is crispy, but not tough. And the hot and sour soup...well you'll have to just try it for yourself. Providing the perfect family meal on a cool fall night when Netflix and the sofa call, for Clevelanders--Phusion is a must."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this place a four because I feel as though the quality and taste of the food was very authentic. So much in fact that it tastes like my moms cooking, and she lived in southern Taiwan until she was about 25 years old. Dishes tried: Beef Noodle Soup. Braised Pork Belly with Preserved Veggies. (\"What she order?\") Fish Fillet. Black Milk Bubble Tea. 

However, keep in mind that I've been in Taiwan and have eaten the most drool-worthy, dream-inducing, taste bud-exploding dishes. This place does not compare to the real deal. It is more of a home cooked taste. Now, that's a good thing because it means it is made with love and care. However, in my life it is also a bad thing because I can literally stay at home and eat the same food. I likely won't be making a trek to Cleveland solely to eat here. If I'm in the area though, I'd keep it in mind. Especially since the manager/owner gentleman was extremely friendly, and the servers were very kind.


p.s. The tea was good, but the bubbles need a little extra OOMPH in my opinion."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine lived in Taiwan for about 10 years, and she approves of the unique (to Cleveland) Taiwanese fare here. The space is pretty basic, but the owners are proud of what they're doing, and they are making some great dishes that you just can't get anywhere else in town. Authentic and delicious."}
{"text":"We always order ??? and ????They're always good! And tea is good too with bubbles."}
{"text":"?????.
Accidentally run into this place while I'm looking for pho. This place is doing very good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is the same restaurant as the Superior rd one, but they are quite different. I used to love the food at Phusion Cafe on superior rd so I was pretty excited this new store. However, things have changed. I visited and got beef noodle soup and fried chicken. The beef was kinda hard to chew, soup was not flavored right (very bland taste, plus there's a hint of vinegar in the soup), and noodle was definitely way too soft. Fried chicken was okay, but a little bit over cooked. After all, it's good that there are new food options around campus, and the owner was very kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"Horrible service with the worst management I've ever seen.  Waited 30 minutes for burnt food and then still forgot my drink and the \"owner\" -Johnny- claims I received it but I never did and he wanted to debate me about it."}
{"text":"The beef noodle soup is awesome!!!! So authentic
????????????

Noodle is chewy and the soup base flavorful with hint of tomato and savor of beef stew. The pickled vegetables garnished on top makes the noodle even more chewy! The baby Bokchoy is soaked with soup base as well!!

The basil Eggplant dish is also very good! Has many vegetables and instead of being greasy and sweet, the basil and onions make it really refreshing!!"}
{"text":"Had a bubble tea craving as we drove through Cleveland. I'm so happy we decided to stop at this location based off other Yelp recommendations. Super easy to get to, no traffic, easy to get back into I-90 after. Jasmine bubble tea was spectacular as well as the traditional. Service was great, loved reading the menu and checking out the food. We will be back to eat next time!!!"}
{"text":"The beef noodle soup was meaty and tasty but one dimensional. I enjoyed the street noodles much better. Service is friendly but can be slow."}
{"text":"Tried this place for delivery to my hotel twice now and I've enjoyed each time.

If you are into traditional Chinese food over breaded Kung pow chicken stuff, I think this is your place to go downtown.

The pork belly is as good as I hoped it would be."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch after our trip to the Asian Store. I found Phusion on Yelp, of course. The place has street parking only from what we could see. Considering it's only 10 degrees in Cleveland today, we weren't out looking for a lot. The place is very small and part of a few shared businesses in the building. Look for the red awning over the door or you may pass it up. We asked our hostess what was really good. She told us the beef noodle soup. We both got that, a scallion pancake & a shrimp egg roll each. Everything was outstanding. The soup had a wonderful broth and the bits of pickled radish really made it pop. The egg rolls were stuffed with shrimp and really good and the scallion pancake was not greasy and had great flavor. I look forward to coming back to Phusion to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food! 

Ordered delivery 5pm on a workday and the food was here in 30 mins. Wow! 

Don't miss out on their Popcorn Chicken!"}
{"text":"Great place for Taiwanese food. The handmade noodles in Beef noodles were amazing, chewy and very authentic. Also tried the popcorn chicken, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I had the popcorn chicken, peddler soup, and the three cup chicken. I didn't take pictures because I wanted to eat, not do I photo shot. The hot sauce is mouth numbing and addictive. The staff is friendly and attentive. I had an outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Really good food. Tried salty tang yuen soup, stir fry pork and squid Hakka style. Taiwan fried chicken. Very home style cooking. Sesame tofu. Will come again for beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"A great little Chinese place in Cleveland, adding Taiwanese into the mix of Chinese foods we can get here."}
{"text":"We ordered a lot of different food from here during our visit:
- beef noodle soup with handmade noodles: Amazing flavors, really tender meat, and noodles were really chewy and fresh. It was awesome. They also gave us some house-made spicy sauce, and that spicy sauce was really spicy! But it was really flavorful and delicious. 5 stars
- pork chop noodles: I ordered this with handmade noodles too, but there was some miscommunication and we got the normal noodles. They tasted really soft and not very good at all. The pork chop was okay, but the breading was really thick. They put some meat sauce on top of it though, which makes it much more tasty. The pork itself isn't very flavorful, and the breading is a bit thick. 3 stars.
- pork chop rice: Pork chop was the same as with the noodle. As far as the rice goes, it was just a bowl-turned-upside-down of white rice, no sauce on it. My dad ended up scooping some of the beef noodle soup to put on the rice so there was flavor on it. Not sure why they didn't put any of the minced meat on top of the rice. 3 stars.
- scallion pancake: It was really thin and pretty hard, not fluffy at all. It wasn't very flavorful either, and there was definitely a bunch of oil on it. Not too big a fan to be honest. 3 stars
- popcorn chicken: Chicken was okay as far as flavor goes, but there could have been more flavor. It was heavily friend so it was really crispy on the outside. Breading was also somewhat thick, pretty average. 3 stars
- matcha bubble tea, no sugar no ice: Powder alert! Upon the first sip, I knew it was powder. It was sweet even without sugar, and I could very clearly taste the powder. Coming from the Bay Area, I know what quality bubble tea tastes like, and this was not it. We got the bubbles on the side because we were going to take this home to my sister, but she didn't like it either. The bubbles were pretty hard on the inside and the powdery tea did not do it any good. We ended up dumping it because nobody in our family wanted to drink it. Also, the waitress didn't ask us what size we wanted, and she automatically gave us a large size. Not a fan. 1 star

TL;DR: 
Get the beef noodle soup with handmade noodles. Everything else is mediocre. Service is friendly though; the owner came around to chat with us a bit and he was quite friendly. Pretty awesome. Good portions for the cheap price too, hooray!"}
{"text":"It tastes just like the real Taiwanese food.... I ordered three times already within one month. XD. Will keep having my meals from there :)"}
{"text":"So let me start by saying- I have no frame of reference for Taiwanese food. I'm from Cleveland, and from what I hear, this is Cleveland's first Taiwanese restaurant-- so I've got nothing to compare it to. 
That said, I've been here twice now, and I really like it!
The first time, I was in a big party, and honestly, a little overwhelmed. I ordered beef noodle soup, because it had been recommended to me. I loved it. Really great flavor, and such a warming comforting food. I also had milk tea bubble tea, which was very tasty!
I just went again, though. My friend and I got there kind of late- close to 8. So it was just us and 1 other table. We chatted with the owner for a bit, who gave us lots of recommendations and described a lot of the menu items to us. He is obviously very proud of the quality of the food and his restaurant. We ended up ordering the handmade dumplings, pan fried-- seriously so delicious! Dipped in soy sauce, vinegar, and their house made hot oil! Yum. We had beef noodle soup again, which was like I remembered. And I got \"three cups\" chicken. The owner had mentioned that this is traditionally served with bones in. So that's how I ordered it. A little trickier to eat, but it had a really great and unique flavor. It was cooked with fennel, whole pieces of ginger root, and basil, in a savory sauce. I thought it was really great, and unlike anything I've ever eaten.
Our server was really sweet- she checked on us often, and we made nice conversation. After we were done, she brought us some crab rangoon as a treat! so nice!
If I were you, I'd definitely give Phusion a try! It is very casual, with really reasonable prices. The service is great, and the food is very comforting."}
{"text":"Stopped in and had some Sa Jiang Mian and some of the popcorn chicken. The Sa Jiang Mian was pretty good but the popcorn chicken was just average. The breading was kind of like a panko breading you would find on Japanese food and I was pretty disappointed they didn't use the traditional Five Spice Powder that you normally find on Taiwanese popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Very good, authentic Taiwanese/Chinese food. I usually get the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and popcorn chicken. Pricing is good, serving sizes are medium. They also have bubble tea, I've had matcha and coffee. Definitely one of my go-to places. Same building as Superior Pho and Ha Ahn, kind of sketchy location, shares bathrooms with the other restaurants which are not the cleanest."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch solely based off of the reviews here. I don't know what I did wrong, but this place was pretty disappointing. I have never had Taiwanese so I wanted to try something new and ordered the \"Three Cups\" chicken because the waitress recommended it. My coworker ordered the \"Beef with Szechuan Pickle\". Huge portions, but the food was cold,  tasted so plain, and needed the spicy sauce they serve with it to give it any kind of flavor. We had a hot tea each, and the Crab Rangoons as an app. The bill came out to $38. We were not impressed and probably will not come back. Could have went to Superior Pho for less money and way better food."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. The staff here so friendly. Really nice and authentic Chinese food. Chicken tender rich my favorite."}
{"text":"Impressive. Tasty. Random location but good.

After hearing fellow yelper Ferdinand and yelper Joyce rave about this place this past weekend, we decided to give it a try.. With them with us, of course (well it was opposite, they invited us!).

I had been wondering about this restaurant- ironically, I get facials next door and have been hearing them make noise for the last couple of months.. So truly happy they're open now!

Located in the middle of the superior Asia plaza (behind superior pho, and literally in the middle) is Phusion Cafe. It's definitely cafe style, but with legit Taiwanese food.

We tried a multitude of dishes-the three cup chicken,  salt and pepper pork, ground pork with rice, pork with veggies, and my fave- beef noodle soup. I particularly liked their beef noodle soup the best- it wasn't oily, wasn't too sweet, but was just right. Overall it was good. I was satisfied. Overall every single dish was cooked well and was good- I really have no complaints. 

They also use TenRen tea (oh I missed it) for their milk tea. Mmmmmm....

If you're looking for a legit Taiwanese food place to eat, you got to check out Phusion Cafe. It's in a random location, but it's definitely worth the stop- good prices, good food, and super nice people who own the restaurant- I'm happy it's in CLE!"}
{"text":"Great Taiwanese food in CLE! 

Recommended items are braised or stewed pork with rice, handmade potstickers, Sichuan green beans, popcorn chicken, green onion pancake, beef noodle soup, any Hakka stir fry, Peddler noodles, eggplant, any stir fried vegetable. 

Service is fantastic. Support this business!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times, each time with a different group of friends. Overall, I think the price was pretty reasonable. But their business doesn't seem to be that good recently compare to when it first started, maybe because of their location- it was kinda in the hallway. I would recommend their fried squid, fried fish fillet, popcorn chicken, three cup chicken ( used to be meh but recently we ordered it again and I was pretty happy with the improvement), and braised ground pork over rice. Check in on Yelp saves you $1 for over $10 spending!"}
{"text":"We went here with our family after a gymnastics meet for \"Chinese\" noodles.  The service was excellent and she recommended an assortment of plates served family style. The food and boba tea was delicious!! Highly recommend for authentic food in a casual environment. Happy we found the place, thanks to Yelp!"}
{"text":"I was really excited about this place. Their peddlers noodle soup was really good, especially for 7 bucks. Paired it with a large lychee bubble tea and lychee jelly. Soo good!"}
{"text":"So excited to find a good Taiwanese restaurant in Cleveland! I was in town visiting a friend and we had just come back from a long weekend at Cedar Point. Being from Houston and having frequented Taiwan several times, we were craving a soothing, hot bowl of beef noodle soup. We arrived around 815pm (closes at 9pm) and were seated right away. 

My friends got the beef noodle soup, and I got the pork and pickled radish noodle soup. Both were excellent - the broth was so flavorful. The broth was definitely on par with that in the noodle soups I've had in the Houston Chinatown. The only complaints I could think of were the noodles (I wish they were thicker and/or homemade) and the beef was a bit bland (but it was super tender). We also got some bubble tea - tea was yum but the actual tapioca was pretty overcooked.

If I lived in Cleveland, I'd frequent this place very often....great, authentic Taiwanese cafe with super nice owners and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It's a rare thing when I want to try almost everything on a menu. And what a menu! It's extensive and features lots of traditional Taiwanese entrees, soups, noodles and appetizers. Prices are very reasonable and we ended up picking 8 or 9 dishes for just the 4 of us! Their tea selection was great! The teas are a bit pricier but delicious. 

The waitress was really nice and polite. Service here was a little hard to understand as two seemingly random customers seemed to be bussing our plates back and forth but it was hard to tell if they were working or not...

Location is small but even included a parking lot. I love that about Cleveland Chinatown. Taste, variety = fantastic! Would definitely recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! ??? is awesome? highly recommend?"}
{"text":"Phusion is a tiny restaurant but does delivery and take-outs, too. This place features plenty of authentic Taiwanese food and regional tastes. Although there's not much you can explore around this place, it is a good place for a more relaxed lunch. To my surprise, this place has very good service compared to many other Asian restaurants. But even though it's a cafe, their bubble milk teas are not that good."}
{"text":"Ok, Phusion, after just one visit, I can honestly say that I love you. Can we get together every day? I wish that I was a student at Case or CIA, so that I'd be close enough that we could make our union official and a reality! This is so not your typical American type of restaurant, which is a very good thing in my book, but might be off putting to some. 

First off, you need to know that Phusion is tiny and cramped, seating just 17. We came at night on a Friday and were the only ones there, but I imagine this could be a problem during lunch hour. The open kitchen is microscopic and nearly every horizontal surface is loaded with stacked items and ingredients. 

The food they put out is delicious! We had:

+Beef soup (with rice noodles). Fatty meat, a pickled vegetable of some sort (bitter melon, maybe?), bok choy, cabbage and a flavorful broth. The broth was VERY tasty. 
+BBQ tofu, which came with broccoli and a humongous mountain of rice. This could easily be two or more meals for someone.
+Scallion pancakes. A bit doughy, but still tasty. Even better with the accompanying sauce. 
*Homemade hot sauce, which was sitting out in a little bowl on each table. I don't know what was in this, but it seemed to have chunks of garlic in it and was incredible!

While this was a delightful initial sampling, there are so many other options I'd like to try, so Will definitely be going back in the near future. Probably not every day, as I'd like, but hopefully soon. 

P.S. Are you a tea drinker? They also had a few different boxes of Chinese teas for sale, which could be convenient for those that can't make it down to Asian Town to stock up. 

By the way, parking is available in a metered lot at the corner of E 115th, just half a block away. They deliver, too, if you're close enough! Call to place an order."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. We stumbled upon it by accident. We were on our way into Superior Pho and it turned out they were closed for the day. One of the employees at Superior Pho actually referred us to this place. We had one of their soups with homemade noodles, the scallion pancakes, the braised pork, literally everything is good. You really can't make a bad choice. The employees are extremely friendly and the prices are way lower than you would expect. I now order delivery from here pretty often."}
{"text":"Yummy Taiwanese food. 

Only complaint, they need to get a heater during the colder months. 

Service was very friendly and informative.

Will go back when warmer and get the milk tea!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Asain Fusion places in Greater Cleveland."}
{"text":"It's an odd little restaurant that makes you wonder if you're at the right place as you walk in. But the owners are super courteous, they recognize that confused look, and quickly usher you into the dining space. 

You can see the menu I posted in the pictures, an appropriate variety of things to choose from.  They also use ten ren tea for their milk tea beverages, kind of reminds me of all the great places back in LA. The Cleveland Asian food scene is getting much better these days with a good variety to consider.

Food:
Salt and pepper pork: It was over-fried, dried out.  The meat lost its texture.  The seasoning was good, but left me disappointed.

Schechwan string beans: Well done with a good level of spice that most everyone would be able to tolerate.  Hard to mess this up.

Taro & Pork: This item was not on the menu, but the owner recommended it so we went with it.  Not bad, but not great.  Lacked a little bit of seasoning.

In general, I went with great expectations based on reviews.  I think maybe I didn't try the best items and they likely deserve another shot.  But based on what I already tried, I think I would choose to order all the same items from other pre-existing restaurants.  Their beef noodle looks really good... should try that next time.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"We had popcorn chicken, Hakka Style Tofu, chicken tender with rice, ham fried rice for dinner. Taste great!:) will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I'm liking this restaurant's concept. The menu is extensive and mostly comprised of inexpensive appetizer-like dishes that you can share with a small group. 

I first ordered the Taiwanese popcorn chicken and while I have had better elsewhere, it wasn't bad at all. The portion size is reasonable for the cost. I then tried the scallion pancakes which needed more flavor so I used a sweet red sauce that was provided to dip it in. I enjoyed the fried dumplings the most. The wrapper was thicker than what I am used to but I actually enjoyed that aspect of it. 

Yes, this place is quite small, but most people order to go anyways so I don't think getting a table will be a problem if you plan on dining in. Phusion is a good place to go if you're not too hungry and just want some small bites, but don't expect anything amazing."}
{"text":"My friend and I found this place by accident when we were trying to find a bubble tea place. I really like how the tea and the milk here blend together. The bubble from the store is soft, firm and fun to chews. Not only does the bubble tea taste so great, the store owner and employees are extremely considerate too. For example they would gives me more bubbles and make my tea sweeter for my taste. Their food look great and taste even better. 
For anyone that love bubble tea and great food, this place is definitely a must go to and not expensive either."}
{"text":"I've been holding off writing a review for this place for quite a while now. About a year actually, although it wasn't because I hadn't tried it. In fact, I've visited this restaurant several times in the past year, but I could never give it the review I truly wanted to. 

First off, let me just say that I have such admiration for the owner of this restaurant. Did you know that he owns not just one, but three restaurants in Cleveland? Each with a different menu and concept? Yet every time I stop in Phusion, there he is at the front, greeting people, cashing them out, asking how their food was, humble as can be. This guy is pure immigrant work ethic and it just fills my heart with happiness for his business success thus far.

That being said, the first few times... okay the first several times I came in here, the service (aside from that via the owner) was just poor. It wasn't bad in the sense that the servers were rude or impatient, they were just poor servers. They were awkward, they acted like they had never worked in a restaurant before, and they didn't sell the product to me. This is what made it hard for me to, as I said, give this place the review I wanted to. There was always just something a little off about it.... until now. The last two times I've stopped in, there has been the sweetest, kindest, friendliest girl working there (I'm sorry I wish I knew her name!). She is very knowledgeable about the menu, and was able to offer suggestions to my friend who had never been. She is engaging without hovering, and goes above and beyond to give great customer service. This is what I've been waiting for all along! Now onto the food....

The food is true Taiwanese delight. I haven't tried a ton of dishes on their menu, but those I have tried have been not what I expected at all, and this is a great thing. You see, oftentimes I have an expectation going into Chinese restaurants that they will offer something only vaguely Chinese, modified for American palettes, and I leave feeling oh so dismayed. This place however, is authentic Hakka cuisine. Each dish I've had reminds me of a street food stand, and not in a bad way, but in the sense that it tastes so homemade, so pure to the intent, that you have no doubt as to what they intended the dish to be. Take for example the potstickers. Now, normally you order potstickers, and you get these measly little pockets with filling that has no resemblance to anything you could identify. The potstickers here however, are giant doughy pillows filled with juicy meat that leaves you to discern whether you should keep chowing down or wait for the giant clouds of steam to escape (personally, I'm never that patient). I also want to give a shoutout to the beef noodle soup... it's rich, it's full of tender chunks of beef, and to top it off they offer hand pulled noodles leaving you so satisfied and full. Finally, you can't leave here without getting some of their bubble tea! It's pretty sweet, but they use Ten Ren tea, not powder, so you get a lot of flavor and the fruit ones are so refreshing on a hot day. 

Phew. I feel better now I was able to properly review this place. Now just fingers crossed they can keep up the good service!"}
