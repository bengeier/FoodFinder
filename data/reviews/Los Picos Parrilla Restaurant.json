{"text":"An hour and a half to serve four people mediocre food? I think not. The mole sauce was delicious, but just putting chicken wings to swim in it on your plate does not make it suitable. The chimis were less than good, with absolutely NO seasonings for the meat. It should have been delicious, but honestly it was a let down. The food was mediocre (if not lacking) and the service was awful. Service was slow to pick up after people left, never asked if we wanted refills (after an hour and a half! really?) and honestly needed work. Along with all of the food. Only a few chips and out of the bottle salsa for starters? No thanks.   Next time, I'll just drive all the way to Phoenix for some Mi Patio! Honestly, the only thing worth the money is the menudo. I won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"Rude waitress looked at my family with disdain and said in a annoyed tone, \"Sit wherever. \"  We sat down patiently for 10 minutes without service.  Sadly we wasted our time and left."}
{"text":"I love there tacos. The rice is not like your ordinary. It is delicious and the retried beans are made from scratch. They are not salty like most places. I have found my new fav."}
{"text":"I come here for the pozole or menudo most Saturdays.   Recommend both of these two food items!"}
{"text":"So very good!  Been eatting hear for years. I love their tacos.  And the seafood soup"}
{"text":"This restaurant alone was worth the flight from Indiana hours earlier.   I seldom get to spend time in AZ and the food available at places like this is one of the things that draws me into the cities when I do have a rare work and/or pleasure stay in the Southwest.  This is the real deal down from the genuine waitress open to uninhibited conversation to the very bold and fresh preparation of flavors you just cannot find in the Midwest.   We tried: 1) Pollo en Mole Poblano (Chicken with Puebla-Style Mole Sauce).  Chicken on the bone slow cooked and falling apart with a very bold, moderately spicy and chocolaty rich Puebla Mole sauce, very tasty beans and saffron accented rice.  This meal was $12, as are all of their dinner choices on the back of the menu.     2) Fajitas de pollo.  We didn't want to miss out good fajitas (and we did not).  Nicely herbed, lightly prepared with a minimal amount of oil, and not a minute overcooked (very rare in Indiana.... where chicken needs to be tough most of the time).  Fresh, light, and well balanced.  The included side of guac was truly excellent.  Again, $12 well spent.  3) Chips & Salsa.  Chips were not hot, which is of course a let down.  Even if the chips were not just made, they can still be reheated provided they haven't dried out.  Heat up those chips (the oils taste better)!  The salsa was redeeming.  A true fresh, bold chipotle salsa (which I would preferred to have had more heat, yet still delicious) and a great complementary flavor to have on the table.    4) Margaritas.  Blended, real ingredients.  Mildly sweet and wonderfully fresh.  Great tasting tequila for a $6 (16 ounces?) beverage.    On these travels I'm always prepared to be let down by a bad pick; this place was an excellent choice and when I'm around here again I will be scheduling a time to enjoy a sit down at Los Picos Parrilla.  Yum."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like (and may be) a reclaimed fast food joint.  But on the inside, it seem like you're in Mexico! The menu is not entirely unique, but everything seems fresh and home made.  The tortas are exquisite, and the cheese and potato soup and albondigas are my favorite in town.  Add to this a friendly staff (mostly family) and wonderful freshly made sangria and other mixed drinks, and you can't go wrong.  Beer is served with iced mugs,and chips and salsa, both homemade, are plentiful."}
{"text":"Best ceviche I've ever had is at Los Picos! Their chips and salsa are addictive. Their margaritas are amazing and fresh(ie not the bottled mix). Last but not least, their enchiladas(both red and white) are delicious. I highly recommend this place as affordable and delicious!  I have posted most of the photos of the place and know the layout pretty well. Definitely a small place, but not too small(I'd say intimate is a good way to describe it). A party of 25 would fit just fine. Maybe more since there is also outdoor seating(two tables). Staff is wonderful and place is quite cleanly. What more can I say? Go there, and enjoy what so many already do."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for good pozole. We did a search and found this nice Mexican food restaurant. Our waitress, was Ofelia. She was very nice and friendly. The service was great. The food was also great and my wife is hard to please. If she's pleased, then I'm pleased."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall mexican restaurant has been around for years! Authentic mexican food is delish!! Breakfast plates are all soo good! Especially their all you can eat menudo or pozole! I love their stuffed green chile shredded beef chilaca style for appetizer mmmm!!! Can't go wrong with any chimichangas!!! My fav is the 2 green chile shredded beef enchiladas with rice n beans. Rice isn't red though but it is still delish! All their soups are amazing. As for dinner the carne asada plate and mixed fajitas are money!"}
{"text":"I actually went to this place after reading Yelp reviews! My friends were very impressed with the ambiance, service and the margaritas! I thoroughly enjoyed the feel of the restaurant and was definitely impressed with the service as well. I ordered the huevos rancheros papas y queso burro. It wasn't the best breakfast burrito I've ever had but my friend got a dish made with cactus and it was VERY good! I had never experienced such a unique food as cacti and it was awesome! Definitely something I will have again!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was very authentic! And the beer was very cold...It's a hidden gem! You must try it!"}
{"text":"this place has great food but service is extremely slowwwwww! if you have all day to wait to eat or get cashed out come here!"}
{"text":"Not the prettiest place in the world, but food is excellent! Great margarita, wonderful fare. The menu is simple and so is the food. Sometime the simplistic things are the most enjoyable in life!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday for menudo and my husband had their egg and potatoes burrito for himself. The burrito alone was over priced and it was quite small. Two menudo plates and a plate with just a burrito, two hochata drinks and a limonada(limonade) came out to a little over $35. The menudo was bland and the services was awful. I had to keep waiting for the waitress so I could have limes and bread rolls for our menudo. It was not that busy, ether. It seemed like the kitchen was having some issues too. They serve big portions of the menudo and it is all you can eat...if you can get them to serve you another plate! I'll try them again for lunch and see if the time of day changes the type of service. I've had better menudo at Filibertos and I'm Mexican! You're better off going to Ranch Market in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This is a Geat!  small find for anybody looking for a great Mexican restaurant. They are munudo is outstanding. The bloody Mary's outstanding. They have recently added some outside seating. This is a perfect time of year to enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"I love coming here to eat. A true little gem for some legit food made with love. Pozole and menudo served whenever and you can order all you can eat!"}
{"text":"The food is Delicious but only certain server have good hospitality i was there on Sunday brought a big crowd everyone's was enjoying the music man the lady told him to stop playing because we where roudy all we was doing is singing with him that was rude why would you have music there for. I spent around 80 wich is my normal spending at that place only for me I could imagine the rest of my friends that came with me. now i know we not welcome"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in az PERIOD!!!!!! Closest thing to me grandmas cooking. Looks run down but this place is killer."}
{"text":"I adore this tiny, yet charming, family run spot!  It is just a speck on the road and doesn't look like much, but there are treasures to be discovered inside.  You can't go wrong with the beef taco, rice and beans combo plate or try the more traditional tio pancho pork items.  They're always super busy on weekend mornings.  Try their huevos rancheros with green sauce . . . you'll be licking the plate.  I have had pretty much everything on the menu and they haven't disappointed yet.  Oh and they seriously make the best margs in town.  No sweet and sour mix here, just fresh squeezed citrus deliciousness and their sangria is mighty fine too!"}
{"text":"Really good Mexican food, check. Cold beers, check. Good margs, check! A little scary outside, sure but my friends that's where you will always find the best Mexican food!"}
{"text":"excellent food. I had a couple chicken tacos that were very flavorful and tender chicken.  perfect home made shells. good refried beans and rice. the best mexican food I have had - Anywhere!  pico de gallo and the guacamole is awesome. Meg had quesadila which she liked.   one bar stool (being from wisconsin, never saw that before).  visited at 6:30 on friday night and only two other diners.  suprised it was empty. little uncomfortable atmosphere. staff could be more friendly we felt like strangers walking into someones private residence. but good food!"}
{"text":"Decided to return to this place a second time on Sunday. It was a true test of patience. Our waitress was horrible. She Took our order and brought our drinks and never returned. We had to flag down other waitresses to see if they could refill our drinks and chips. The food has great taste but the service unacceptable. When they finally Brought our lunch entrees to our table they forgot the tortillas. Nobody bothered to ask if we had everything we needed. Again we were waiting to order more drinks. Finally had to get up and go to the counter to ask for our tortillas. No salsa refills (more like cilantro water) It's a shame because the food truly is good and flavorful but the lack of service isn't a gamble I'll take again."}
{"text":"Great posole - and the kids love their bean and cheese burritos. That's all we have eaten no need to venture further on the menu. Great hangover food. The staff is always very friendly!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and the food is great too!  Our server was very friendly and she was attentive even though she was the hostess/waitress/bartender/busser all in one.  First off - the salsa is authentic and reminds me of my family's salsa.  It is somewhat mild, but with just enough kick for everyone to enjoy.  The Margaritas are AWESOME!  They are made with hand squeezed juices and good tequila.  I had a regular lime rita, but my friends had strawberry blended ritas and they were also superb. For dinner I ordered a \"Burro\" (burrito) with their signature tiopancho pork.  The pork is to die for - it's super tender and flavorful with whatever they marinade it in.  I couldn't stop eating it.  One of my friends got a tiopancho pork chimichanga which she said was awesome, and my other friend got carne asada and bean burrito with a side of rice.  The rice is a saffron rice, I really liked it.  It's subtle, but a great addition to the meal.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone living or visiting the area.    2 thumbs up!  I would like to taste their breakfast items and pozole before giving 5 stars, but it is very close to 5 stars based solely on the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Amazing service,  chips and salsa are homemade and fabulous.  The food is delicious,  drinks are cold.  Menudo is the best,  been coming here for years and it always tastes perfect.  I don't like the meat,  they are kind and serve only hominy without issues!  I love this place.  And the musician is a bonus!!!!"}
{"text":"Well we drove across town to try this place because of the good reviews. First of all I LOVE hole in the wall Mexican places and I have been to a lot. I am from Denver and pretty much grew up on Colorado Mexican. We spent six years in Southern Cali, and about two years in Arizona. The food is just very,different then Colorado and with that said I want to rate this place on the low end of the scale. If the chips and salsa would have been decent I probably would have left a bit happier. The chips were cold, thick and flavorless, the salsa was a very thin not so great as well. There were 5 adults in our party, everyone got something different. I was not impressed by any of it. I ordered a chimichanga at the recommendation of the server and it was not good at all.  I got it \"enchalada\" style for two more dollars and it had about a spoonful under it, not enchalada style at all and for $12.00 I was like seriously wishing we were anywhere else then there. The waitress was very friendly and brought me a side of sauce but the best thing about this place is you get a giant Coke with refills. My husband and daughter had a margarita and they were decent but for just under a hundred bucks I was pissed all the way home lol!, If your ever in Colorado hit the Santiago's, and see how we make our Mexican :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and been happy with the food every time. This is one of those old buildings on university that has been around forever. Don't be scared off. They are gonna be good.... This time I ordered some posole and had it delivered...the broth was awesome and they were generous with their meat. It's just a Great Food!! *My order was actually originally delivered to me missing an item. I called the restaurant and she rectified it right away. the driver came back with the right food and lots of apologies. I will be going back not only for their yummy food but also their customer service.* thank you!!"}
{"text":"I took Dora, Diego, Boots and Swiper here for menudo and pozolé. Delicioso! Yum yum yum yum yum!  ....but really though...when people ask me if I want Mexican food...this is the only place that comes to mind.  EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican Food! This is truly a wonderful family owned restaurant with fresh food that is amazing. Please don't go here if you are in a hurry or if you are a person that wants the dinning establishment to be in pristine condition, you won't be satisfied. This is a down to earth, homily vibe and the food is really good! I can't wait to go again. My wife and I both had Chimichangas, covered in green sauce with sour cream and guacamole, then also with a side of rice and beens. We didn't want the meal to end!"}
{"text":"Ok I've been coming here for about 20 years now and generally always order Posole.  Tonight was no exception.  I hadn't been here in 2.5 years after a mildly bad experience.  Not much has changed, everything looks the same.  Had an absolute angel for a waitress tonight, don't know her name, very cute, sweet, kind.  The Posole as I always remember needed a little kick to make it taste better.  My angel of a waitress brought some chile pequin and it made it right.  Huge fan, hard to beat, nice to come here when they're not crazy busy.  A slow Monday night certainly fit the bill.  Much Love and Respect.  The entire menu is good, I'm just a huge fan of good Posole having grown up loving it..."}
{"text":"Nice surprise!  Even more surprised when friends walked in.  The food is great. Go after the sun goes down it was over 100 outside and a little too warm for my comfort inside."}
{"text":"Awesome never ending chips. Jamaica aka Sorrel drink is great. The Chimichanga is Amazing!"}
{"text":"The service here sucks, it is very slow and they won't even come to ask if you are doing ok. The only reason they are getting a 4 is because the menudo is so good and their pieces are reasonable. They don't have coke products which is extremely disappointing. It is a small place so if they are busy expect to wait but the food is good and that's the only reason why I will come back."}
{"text":"The food was good. What turned me off was one of the waitresses took the left over chips from a customers table and put it back in the chip bin  Also the service was bad not once did she come and ask us for a refill on our drinks or to see if we needed anything else. We will go back for the food but be sure we will not tip if we have bad service again. Those young girls need to take a class in customer service."}
{"text":"This place was amazing their margaritas were better than any ive ever had and were made fresh to order , none of that premixed stuff here. We also ordered chicharones which is something we had never tried before and I have to say that too was great. The staff was very friendly and even joked around with us."}
{"text":"Starts off with homemade chips and salsa. Margaritas on the rocks or blended, absolutely amazing. Anything you order is made fresh with quality ingredients and authentic recipes. The ambiance is perfect, the music performer completes this family owned gold mine. This is a must. We moved to north Phoenix and STILL make the drive to come enjoy this place. This family deserves a lot. They work hard and put out an amazing product and experience. We are glad to support their business and tell EVERYONE about it. Get the steak fajitas!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but not super fantastic. I like it here because it's a small place with pretty authentic Mexican food. A bit overpriced due to the a la carte and additional toppings. Not a big deal though. All the ingredients are fresh and simple. House made sauces and salsas. Only thing that really sucks is the service. There's only one girl every time we go. She's very nice but not fast @ all. Nice server, super slow service. Don't expect a speedy lunch."}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh how many way can I say Yummy!! I'm in Az. on vacation and this has been the best authentic Mexican food I've had since I've been here and quite honestly my meal rated in my top 3 Mexican meals ever.  This is the place to try something you have never had before because it will undoubtedly be amazing.  I ordered Noplitos En Chili Colorado off the favorites section of the menu and I would order it again. It had prickly pear cactus and potatoes, pork in a red chili. It was not spicy and was so amazing. I shared it with my table and everyone loved it.  The rest of the people I was with ate tacos and they were beautiful. You could tell the shells were homemade and ingredients were fresh. Everyone was happy we stopped here to eat.  The restaurant was small and clean and had a feeling of being ran by a family that stuck to traditional recipes and cared about your experience.  I will return upon my next trip to Az."}
{"text":"Missed it the first time I drove by, it's a small place, maybe a dozen tables; a real mom and pop type place.  GIANT goblets of margarita and sangria for $7. brilliant.  Authentic mexican foodstuffs at the best prices I've ever seen.  Great place to drink or eat, will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Far from being a good tasty meal.  Well where do I start do I start? Do I start with the waitress who has an attitude? do I start with the owner that's almost falling over cause he's drunk or the poor quality bad tasting food.   Upon walking into the restaurant most of the tables were covered with dirty dishes drinks and food. No big deal I thought. But when it takes 5 minutes to get a table cleaned off so you can sit down that kind of become the problem.  So we get a table cleaned off like I said. And the waitress has a huge attitude like we're being an inconvenience I guess I thought she was having a bad night. So she asked us what do we want to have to drink and we order our drinks. So she brings out a basket of chips and salsa the chips taste over to expand the salsa taste like store bought. You know how to salsa that's from the store has kind of a metallic process taste. That's what this salsa tasted like. To me that's not a good sign. So about 5 minutes have passed and she takes our order. I got the chimichanga with shredded beef and my fiance also got a chimi Changa with carne asada and she got it wet with red sauce. We also got a plain quesadilla for our daughter.  What about 5-10 minutes has passed we still haven't gotten our drinks. My 5 year old says out very loud Dad where are our drinks I am thirsty at this point I am wondering the same thing. So very tall man who is dressed very nicely is working behind the counter by the bar area and you can tell he is very intoxicated. I asked him if we can get our drinks and we finally get our drinks after I have to get up and he apologizes for spitting and talking and slurring his words.  So we have drinks and we finally get our food. The chimichangas were presented very well and they look fantastic but looks can be deceiving. I cut my chimichanga in half and take a bite of my food. And was very disappointed. The meat tasted like it was cooked in a crock pot with just water and it also tasted like recycled meat, you know meat that is a day or two old. The other thing was I would think my food was come out with beans and rice but it was just a chimichanga. Also the quesadilla was just a quesadilla there was no beans or rice with it. So I had to order beans and rice for everybody cuz we want beans and rice with our food. My fiance who was pregnant took a couple bites and she said let's just go.  I go to pay for our food and it comes out to $71 and I think to myself I didn't order any alcohol or anything. So basically I paid $71 for s***** food s***** service and watching a drunk guy fall on tables what trying to clean them which you never did and all the tables were still dirty when we left. So to all these people saying this is great fantastic Mexican food or authentic Mexican food I say to you you stop lying to yourself and everyone else. A frozen burrito probably would have been better than the food we had. We ended up going to a roach coach and getting some killer street tacos"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The outside of the restaurant looks a little old but the food is great. Reminds me of old Mexico. The only difference is that the bathroom works here."}
{"text":"Good little Mexican restaurant. I got the #3 combo with chicken which was a great meal. Their rice is the best Mexican rice I have ever had!! The kitchen was a little slow and the restaurant was not that busy. Our server was good and attentive. I would recommend this place, and give 4 stars if the meal was a little quick, especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, the reason why I gave this restaurant a 3 stars because the lack of server, they should considering hiring more waitresses for faster services. Overall the food is great but the wait can take from 30-45 mins for your food due to only having one waitress."}
{"text":"i checked in here and it kept popping up on my yelp. i was like \"I NEVER WENT THERE! HOW DARE YELP TELL ME OTHERWISE! YOU DON'T KNOW ME!\"   well, i went through some of the pictures and now i remember. i did pick up a to-go order. i had the green chile beef.  very different from other green chile i've had but it was good. obviously it was unmemorable or i have early stages of dementia. either or."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have become regulars at this place because of how fun it is. It's casual, small, and the food is really tasty. I suggest the shrimp torta or the chicken tacos with rice and beans. Mmm-mmm. I'm considering going there now that I am writing this review!  It is a small place, so it may be ideal for groups of 4 or 5 or less.   Don't be intimidated by the neighborhood/what it looks like outside, I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun at Los Picos! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"First eating here and I gotta say the chips and salsa best I've had in Long while and the albóndiga soup was very good"}
{"text":"I also only chose this place based on its high reviews on Yelp. Now I have been to several Mexican restaurants and I have to say this place is not bad at all. I mean its not excellent but pretty good overall. The rice and beans were tasteless but the tacos I had were delicious and the chips and salsa were great. I could drink beers and eat their chips & salsa all night.   The service was awesome, I never had to ask for a refill or more salsa or wait for anything. I was a little cautious because of its location and the way it looked outside but I am glad I tried it out.   Friendly, Good food and very affordable!!!"}
{"text":"Service was not so great, it seems like they are not too well organized for how busy they get. However, the menudo was really good! After I tasted the food, I guess some of the wait was worth it."}
{"text":"Was recommended to us by the hotel we were staying in while visiting Phoenix. Best Mexican I've ever had. Very authentic and tasty.  Place is super cute and quaint. Every time I'm in Phoenix I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The outside is a bit scary looking and very run down.  Inside is cute and the service is good.  Ordered fresh brewed tea, bean and cheese burrito and guacamole.  All were DELICIOUS!  The chips and salsa were just okay... but free!"}
{"text":"I was recommended here by a friend from Phoenix. This place is cozy, has charm, and simple Mexican food that tastes great. I was surprised to see plenty of seating on a Monday afternoon when the lunch rush is usually on. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"By far the best tasting home made Mexican food in the valley. The flour tortillas are huge, the menudo is fresh and fantastic, and the pork tacos are delectable. They fresh squeez a glass of orange juice upon order, and the make the best Cheladas beers! Very small and quaint. If you want food quick go to Taco Bell. If you want authentic great tasting food, Los Picos"}
{"text":"menudo menudo menudo...no I am not talking about the 80s Latin group but this hidden restaurant on University. To be honest I would have have stopped had my friend not took me there.  Small place about 12 tables inside. I almost felt like I was at my aunts house waiting for her to bring me food. Sunday menudo red or white!"}
{"text":"Don't judge a book by its cover. This is a happening little place. Pretty nice on the inside."}
{"text":"This morning I told my mom let's try this place that had great reviews. It was my first time there. The place was pack, which I told my mom must be good but not what I expected or thought. As we walked in no one greeted us. We stand there wondering if someone would seat us. I saw a table and sat there. As I looked around I saw 2 waitresses busy waiting tables and one behind the bar. One of those waitresses brought us menu and asked if would like drinks. She brought back our drinks and took our order. As we waited patiently 30 minutes. My mom mentioned no one offered us chips n salsa. I asked a waitress and she asked, \"no ones brought you guys chips and salsa?\" She immediately went and got us some. After we were done with the chips n salsa and drinks, my mom wanted to leave because we waited to long for our food. Just as my mom wanted to leave they brought out our food, 47 minutes later. Normally the time we waited would have been expected if we order a steak but we ordered Menudo which usually is ready and immediately to serve but I did not know why there was a delay or slow. The food was tasteful but they lack customer service and need more staff to help keep this restaurant in float. If you're going to eat make sure you don't go hungry because you'll be waiting for a long time to be served."}
{"text":"The place is great. The staff is friendly and attentive. I get the all you can eat pozole all the time. I recommend this place to all family and friends."}
{"text":"I ordered the pozole and my girlfriend had the beans and cheese burrito it was delicious you have to come check out this little place."}
{"text":"Menudo sucks omg taste like juanitas can menudo but less flavor and salt no to mention super hard hamony ruined my dinner thanks"}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to lay down a star reduction for this place, unfortunately.  Had breakfast there Sunday 2-20-11.  With tip, came to $11.  Went with the protein punch, the \"Carne Asada Platter\" with two fried eggs.  I was hoping for some \"seasoned\" carne asada, which most places give you these days.  This was just a short, skinny section of over-cooked flank steak.  VERY tough.  Hard to cut with a sharp knife and hard to chew up.  Eggs and re-fried beans were nothing special.  Beans basically tasteless.  The one semi-bright spot was the salsa served with chips before the food came out.  It was good.  Not excellent, not VERY good, just....Good.  I'm gonna have to say this place is hovering between \"slightly below average\" and \"average.\"  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious! Been here 3 times in 3 months and never been disappointed. The restaurant seats 40 at max, cozy and not tacky. To start,  their margaritas and sangria are possibly the best I've ever had. Whether you choose a specialty of the house, soup or other entree you won't be disappointed. Each meal is prepared in a manner that completely satisfies your palate. Their guacamole and cerviche appetizers are plentiful, tasty and a perfect way to start your meal. One of these next times in I'll have to save room for dessert. This place is definitely a hidden jewel in the East Valley. Go and then thank the chef for a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"Food was average & the service was below average.  Our waitress forgot several items and just didn't seem to care.  Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have now been to los picos 4 times, always in the afternoon and never have I been disappointed with the food or service. Yes the food can take awhile but this is not Chipotle, the food is made just for you and the cocktails are fantastic, especially the house sangria.   Obviously because it is west mesa its not the greatest of locations but good authentic mexican food is not easily obtained in the Phoenix area. Ironic, I know.  I highly recommend the mole chicken and the carne asada dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Not pretty and I wish they would invest but it is clean and has a friendly staff. Food is fresh and excellent!"}
{"text":"Went for the all you can eat menudo.. Extremely dissapointed our bowls were full of hominy and very little meat. Service was poor and with a bad attitude. I hate giving bad reviews but i hate getting ripped off even more. We do not recommend this place at all wish i could give it a zero rating."}
{"text":"Visiting from California, I read all the good reviews. Family had asada & eggs, chicken taco, arozo con pollo. All well made, so glad to eat good home cooked Mexican."}
{"text":"The worst place to eat,,, the menudo is pure maiz,,, corn only no meat, I paid $11.00 for a plate and it says on the manu,,, all you can eat...corn only,,, never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! If you like agua de tamarindo this in the best I've ever tasted! The atmosphere is super friendly. The food is worth any wait!!"}
{"text":"Terrific place. Everything was delicious, very good. The Albontigas was muy bueno as was the pork and very good service!"}
{"text":"First time & will be our last time. The good: The waitress was nice & the food did not take long to arrive.  The bad: My daughter would not even eat her bean burrito because when she cut it all the beans flooded out of it resulting in a dark brown puddle on her plate. My husband said his first 2 bites of his chimichanga were good but the rest had a different kind of meat which he was not impressed with. My bean tostada had the same beans as my daughter's burrito & had more lettuce than anything else. The women's restroom had a big metal breaker box at eye level that had DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE written on it with a black marker... The front window had a fly swatter laying on the sill.  There was a fly circling our food. There was a large tear with stuffing showing on the cushion of the booth we were seated in."}
{"text":"The week I moved to Arizona I went here twice! This really is as good as it gets. I will definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"shitty ass service, really good food. Takes forever for them to assist you and even drinks. Won't even mention the wait for the food"}
{"text":"Good local Mexican spot in Mesa. My friend lives right down the street so we went on Fri night for takeout & I was really impressed. The food was relatively inexpensive & delicious. I got the carne asada burrito -- fresh & tasty. They don't seem to have a menu posted anywhere online or a website so we had to go in to place a to-go order. Wait for food was 10-15 minutes (so we got a margarita while waiting!). I will definitely come back when in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is a litle gem in Mesa, Az. Went looking for a place that sells menudo. This place has some nice fresh menudo. Got the white menudo... it came with lemon, cilantro and all the rest of the condiments  needed for  bowl of do. It was about 6 bucks (typical price) Also ordered the green chile breakfast burrito. It was great and reminded me of childhood. The only thing I didn't like was that the menudo was lacking in tripe and PIcos should have  other types of burritos on the menu. It would be nice to see a breakfast burrito that has egg, pinto beans, bacon, potatoes (or fries), pico,  and queso."}
{"text":"As a life long Phoenix resident/Mexican food fan, this is my favorite place of all time.  It's a tiny, family owned hole in the wall for sure, but I have never had anything here that wasn't above average.  When I take out of town visitors here, they ask to go back on subsequent visits, without fail."}
{"text":"Menudo and bolillo! I would give 5, but this is all I have ever had. Many many times. Did I mention all you can eat? Hell yea!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in the Phoenix area. It is a total hole in the wall place. Don't let that scare you off!  Their margaritas are wonderful, rice and beans are awesome, and their chicken enchiladas suizas rock! I alternate between that and their pork \"special.\" 1 star knocked off for slow service."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place! Gracious owners with a charming, nice atmosphere. The posole here is the best around. A local staple that is easy to overlook, I grew up down the street but just never went to eat there. I recently ate here for the first time, and now I keep craving and going back for that posole. Seriously delicious! Good cervezas and margaritas, too. It's a perfect midday lunch spot."}
{"text":"Our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley. Freshest margaritas around, be prepared to wait a few minutes for them to squeeze the various citrus fruits.  Salsa is fantastic.  I think their posole is the best in town.  The conchinita pibil and mole are amazing. The place is alive with regulars, particularly on weekends.  The waitstaff is great."}
{"text":"Feels like we went to Abolitas but we get to each eat something different. Watching all the food come out made us wish we could eat more. I had the chicken fajitas and they were very flavorful. I could taste the spices as well as the meat, onions and peppers. My husband had the chili relleno and it was awesome. Perfectly cooked. I like my salsa a little chunkier but we will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I came here the first time with two girlfriends and there was one other set of patrons in the restaurant. There was no music and it was dead silent. So awkward. We left. I returned later and there were more people and some ambience. The food was okay, the meals were about what you can expect for the area, but the chorizo dip is amazing. From that night on we just order the dip to go."}
{"text":"This was the first meal we enjoyed when moving to Arizona and it really sealed the deal. The food was incredible. The best Mexican my party had ever had. I enjoyed the signature dish as recommendation of the waitress and was extremely pleased. The guac was out of this world. You couldn't be disappointed coming here. Must visit."}
{"text":"This a little family owned and operated business, which i love. I went here with my wife, she had the shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada combo and i had the carne asada chimichanga. For drinks my wife ordered lemon water and i had asked for a coke cause i seen a drink coke sign, but they dont serve coke only pepsi. So luckily i drink both, my wife had asked if they can make her cheese enchilada with shredded beef also and they said yes. When our drinks came they where huge, i think maybe 32 oz glasses. The food came outand everything looked good except when my wife cut open the enchiladas and it was plain cheese. Now usually my wife would complain but she said it was fine and would let the waitress know so they wont charge us extra. When we seen the waitress coming over we was gunna tell her but then she sat down at a table which had a bowl there since we walked in. I told my wife to wait cause the waitress was eatting and looked like she had been trying to eat since we went in. In the end we both agreed that the food was as expected pleasant and we will go back but to try their menudo."}
{"text":"Perfect hole in the wall Mexican food restaurant! Quint,authentic, family owned, just the perfect atmosphere.Great Margaritas! which is always what breaks or makes a Mexican restaurant for me. My friends and I split some awesome oysters which i was apprehensive about at first, just because this place really is the definition of 'hole in the wall,' but they turned out to be great... then again it was my first experience eating oysters... We all ordered burritos which were also very good, I love a place that isn't afraid to use dark meat chicken. I mean why do restaurants always advertise white meat chicken anyways?  that's what usually steers me away from ever ordering chicken in the first place! For sure gotta come back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Albóndiga soup was bomb. Ordered to go and ended up wishing I would of ate in. 32 ounces of homemade awesomeness, for $9 and change it also came with salsa and chips oh and your choice of tortillas."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning and it was busy. Not so busy I had to wait for a table, but busy enough for an authentic atmosphere. My friend and I both had menudo. Mine was white and so delicious! Ingredients were fresh and the place smells amazing. Not 5 stars bc the service was really slow. My menudo sat on the counter for maybe 19 min before it came to my table"}
{"text":"We chose this place based on high Yelp reviews for dinner before our girls night out. Looks like a hole in the wall place in a sorta sketchy area but I felt safe in a group.  This was a two man show on Saturday night. The hostess/waitress/bartender/cashier was awesome and the cook has serious skills!  The margaritas were $7 and made from fresh fruits and great quality tequila...best margaritas I've had in a long time...and not the sugary syrupy kind! Everyone's dinners were perfect and the homemade chips and salsa were delish. I highly recommend this place...I will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here after one of the people at the hotel I was staying at suggested it.  Best suggestion ever!  Have the carne asada.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"the service is a bit slow, but worth the wait the staff is helpful.  The wife and i go for Menudo on Sundays it is delicious.  can't rave enough about it.  go early because sitting is limited and it gets packed quick."}
{"text":"I was craving menudo so of course I consult Yelp. I call several places and choose this place because it's close to home. But I found that they actually have some awesome menudo! They have an all you can eat deal for 9.99 or the single bowl for 8.99. The single bowl is huge but you might as well get the all you can eat deal just in case... Because did I mention it's awesome?!? The place looks divey but ckean which means the food will most likely be good. The girl was friendly and the were several tables filled... All good signs.  I will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"We come here alot!!! All you can eat Menudo!! Kids get the eggs, beans and tortillas. They don't order off the kids menu... Too small for 6 and 9 year olds. I got the chorizo and bean dip!!! Delicious"}
{"text":"I'm from California where you can find The best Mexican outside of Mexico of course. Once in a while I have to travel to AZ for work and I make it a point to eat at Los Picos. I love their shrimp with garlic! everything I've had here is good. I read some of the comments about there not being good Mex food in AZ, well NOW you DO! Try it out, don't be intimidated by the locale, these folks are authentic. Provecho!!"}
{"text":"Really cute little place.  Hubby and I shared a green chili chimi, (Delicious beef green chili.  I always base how well I like a place based on the green chili. ) saffron rice and refried beans (just like from my childhood). We didn't take anything home and we were both satisfactorily full without being stuffed.  I liked the heat of the salsa. The only downside was the chips were slightly over cooked (just kept me from stuffing myself before the meal came which wasn't such a bad thing :)."}
{"text":"I love this place, it's been here for years and is a cozy, intimate, authentic family owned Mexican restaurant. I used to come here years ago and was disappointed when I thought they had closed down. I was so excited to be back in the old neighborhood and see I was wrong and they were still open. Something that really surprised me was that the prices are still really good. I think they have went up a dollar or so in the years since I visited last. And believe me those are a few years back, my kids were babies and my oldest is 14. So, one of the dishes I always loved was the Mojo de Ajo. And I have to say it was just as good as I remember. One of the things I love about this place is their signature Mexican seafood dishes which I think are some of the best in the valley. Another great dish is  the A La Plancha.  It was nice to see the matriarch of this family owned business doing so well, she's still just as nice as I remember her."}
{"text":"The menudo here is perfect. It's been many years that I have had menudo that tasted this good. We had both the red and the white. Both were spot on. Served with Bolio rolls that were toasted just right. The best menudo experience in the metropolitan Phoenix area. The staff was friendly and attentive. The guitar player sang for us which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Mexican restaurant in AZ. Phenomenal staff, super friendly and quick. And the FOOD. The quality of this restaurant is unmatched. It's so authentic and delicious. There is truly no Mexican food as fresh and tasty as Los Picos."}
{"text":"Los Picos is one of our favorite Authentic Mexican restaurants. We recommend the los Borachos shrimp dish and the chicken burros enchilada style.  The margaritas are absolutely wonderful because they are made with fresh fruit. These margaritas are magic in the making!"}
{"text":"Best pozole in town! I go every chance I get. Everyone is extremely hospitable and The chips and salsa are great."}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Our first visit to an 'authentic' mexican restaurant and we are in heaven! The ceviche is to die for, along with everything else we had! Our server, Odelia (sp) was as sweet a pie..even hugged us on our way out! YUM, YUM, YUM"}
{"text":"Don't order the  steak fajitas .I've had more meat stuck between my teeth from a Big Mac than that was given to me on my plate !"}
{"text":"Not too happy with our experience today.  I was really craving some menudo and had been here one time before with decent results, so I thought this was a good choice.  I remember service was slow before, but it was during the week and we were about the only people there.  Well Sunday was even worse.  Dirty tables all over the place and don't even really acknowledge that your there anyway.  They really don't seem to care about service, hoping their food will make up for it.  That fell very flat too today unfortunately. Don't think we will be returning to Los Picos."}
{"text":"Was visiting for spring training from orange county where we have a number of mom-and-pop Mexican joints. Although this place was fairly crowded for a Sunday morning and was highly recommended, my breakfast was very mediocre. At best. First, took forever to get anyone's attention so I eventually went to the register and got my own menu. Then, took another 15 minutes to get chips, salsa and a drink. Finally it took another another 30 minutes to get served the worst version of huevos rancheros I've ever had. Eggs were undercooked and the sauce was thin and tasteless. I would have added the  house salsa (which was actually not bad) to jack it up, but I could not get the waitresses attention to get more as I was only given about three or 4 tablespoons to begin with. Washer down, I also ordered a beer with tomato juice. Maybe this is an acquired taste, but after two sips I wasn't able to choke down anymore. I don't know if this was supposed to be tomato juice but to me it tasted like beer mixed with catchup. Overall just a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place looks very cute inside, but, unfortunately, the food just wasn't that great when I went here for lunch today with a friend. The chips and salsa weren't very good, the chips were stale and the salsa wasn't very flavorful. I ordered a burro with the pork, that someone raved about, but thought it was just ok, a little dry and kind of boring in flavor. My friend got a beef burro combo and the beef was extremely dry and was super peppery, not so good. Also, the rice was bland.... Finally, the service was slow and a bit awkward... like the waitress came and asked us about drinks and then brought the drinks all without giving us a menu... kind of strange.  I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Wow, this might be my new favorite food and happy hour spot. Which is odd, seeing that it's really nice here compared to most of the Mexican food joints I frequent.  Too often, those look like they're in a constant state of construction or disrepair. Anyway, the exterior looks like a small, quaint house with maybe 6-7 parking spots. Inside, there's various tables, booths and a bar to sit at. The corner booth we sat at had a copper table top and looked great.   This might be one of the best margaritas I've had. It's fresh and squeezed, not like the premix stuff you get at most places. They also had draft beer and other mixed drinks. I only had a small bit of the Carne Asada but it tasted fantastic. I definitely am coming back here with a date sometime."}
{"text":"I find some of these reviews quite funny, this is a very intimate authentic Mexican food restaurant. I've never had an issue with the staff.   You have to be understanding when it comes to small businesses like this. When they have such amazing food and only the family is running it. It will take a little for them to help you.   The food is made right where you can see it. Fresh as can be. Unlike macyos or Tia rosas. You have real authentic Mexican food.   If you're expecting to get in and out quickly on a Sunday... You're mistaken. They're menudo is the best in AZ (which has been said by maaaaaaany). Sunday morning is when they make it, so don't expect to get quick seating and you're food right out.   If you're impatient and can't appreciate real authentic Mexican food then go elsewhere. Because us locals don't mind enjoying some chips and salsa and waiting a little longer than normal for some good food."}
{"text":"Very good food. This is where I take family and friends when they come to town.  The #6 enchiladas suizas is the best and I always get the shrimp. The sauce is great in everything and I cover my plate with it.   Every Chimi is great especially the seafood one.   I have been going here with my father in law for the past four years. This year they changes the portion sizes, doubling everything on the plate. We quickly increased our attendance. He goes every Sunday for the menudo.   My F. In L. also introduced me to their pozole. It has this incredible tioponcho pork, with their signature rub. The bowl is huge and it is served with tortillas and fresh chopped cabbage onions and limes.  My wife loves the pork quesadilla, also tioponcho."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful. From the outside it looks like a total dive/whole in the wall and it kind of is but the food and service will make me come back twice this week alone.   I miss Mexican food so this is wonderful!!  I had the #3, taco and cheese enchilada plate which ended up being too much food after drinking one delicious margarita (which they use natural fruit juice instead of sour mix) so if citrus is an issue for you, avoid them.  Otherwise it is very tasty and natural.  They also give you a bowl of chips and salsa, complimentary. For 3 of us with drinks, the meal was $65, not bad at all. I will come back again and again...maybe for lunch too!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and always had a great meal!  Love their salsa bar.  The green lime/guac sauce was a big hit"}
{"text":"Ofelia is the best !! was in town found this place on yelp wow  great Mexican food went there for dinner both nights shrimp burritos shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Overall. Nice & quiet .... & food was good :-)   Parking was a bit confusing ...  But once I found it ..  All was ok.     I would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Omg! The best Mexican restaurant I have had so far! Love how inviting and cozy the place is. Everything we ordered was delicious. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place yes the food is amazing I've posted before it's an amazing great hole in the wall because it's true this is definitely some of the best Mexican food and go figure I'm not even Mexican and Colombian"}
