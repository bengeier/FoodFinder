{"text":"I've been going to Croagh Patrick's for a long time now, and I've got to say that this is one bar in the Downtown Willoughby area where anyone can go, pull up a stool and have a pint and meet someone friendly to talk to. All of the barstaff are eager to serve and quick on the tap. If you're looking for a more relaxed drinking experience and wish to stay away from the hubub of the mainstreet bars, Croagh's is your best bet."}
{"text":"Great food, Great Bartenders, As friendly a place as it gets.  I live in St. Louis but come to Willoughby Ohio once a month, and stopping here for a bite and a thirst quencher is a must.  Bobby, Seamus and McPat are the best."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to get something to eat and a beer after working out at the Y down the street.  Super nice crowd of locals that were having fun throwing darts and drinking on a Thursday night.  My sandwich was really tasty and I had good conversations with a few locals at the bar.    One of the girls I was talking to that frequents the bar often told me that if you want to seat on Friday you have to be in the bar by four and if you want to table you need to be there by six or you'll be standing the entire time.  Overall a really cool experience I'll be back."}
{"text":"If your looking for a local Irish Pub, check this place out. The menu selections look limited, but worry not almost everything they make is great. I highly suggest the Irish Egg Rolls. This is a very modern Irish p[ace with a combo of Irish pub rock and American juke box playing . The seating is nice and very homey and the staff is amazingly friendly. If you don't want just another forgettable experience come here for a pub worth remembering."}
{"text":"Simple menu, great beer options, and a friendly bartender.  Craggy Bogland's is an Irish themed pub we found right across the street from the regal movie theatre off Euclid in Willoughby. From the moment you walk into the dimly lit bar, it screams Irish pub. My only beef is that aside from some corned beef items, there really isn't any Irish fare. The beer made up for not having sheperds pie, I was extremely happy to find a season fat heads called hop juju on the bottle list. We went for the Outlaw burger which comes with onion straws, bacon, bbq sauce and cheese. It came out with a ton of perfectly cooked hand cut fries and did not disappoint.  I would definitely come back for dinner and a brew before a movie."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch for the first time with 2 other coworkers. It is a very small pub with plenty of tvs and ample seating.  The service was fast and friendly, it looked like they had a very nice beer selection with good prices but we could not enjoy them since we had to go back to work.   Drink orders were taken right away followed by are food orders. I ordered celtic egg rolls and the big and saucy, my coworkers ordered a patty melt and a Reuben.  The food was out promptly probably about 15 to 20 min for everything.  My egg rolls were the star for me nice and crispy plenty of cornbeef and kraut filling with a good portion of russian dressing. ( one of my coworkers tried one and said he would have ordered those and not the patty melt, which he enjoyed but said the sandwich portion was small and it was.)  As far as my burger it was perfectly cooked and well seasoned and the bun was nicely toasted.  I do feel it was small also for a \"big and saucy\" with two patties and unfortunately lacked that good amount of there special sauce, i had to use ketchup.  The fries were nice and crispy not your typical fry more of a shoe string fry, they were very good but definitely could have used a fork to eat them.  My coworker that got the Reuben said there was almost no russian dressing on it and had to use mustard to give it some tang.  Overall it was a good experience, food was slightly underwhelming even for the price but still flavorful just needs alittle love. Service was great and friendly, hopefully next time i go i can explore the beer selection.  Food 3 stars service 4.5 stars so 4 overall, if they get the food dialed in definitely could be a 5 star contender."}
{"text":"not too authentic as the last reviewers stated. i'd like to know if they've ever really been to Ireland....."}
{"text":"Might of found a new watering hole out on the east side. This place was awesome because it's more of an old school Irish pub.   Family owned joint, very quaint, and good Irish/old school tunes. Bartender and the staff members were extremely friendly (family owned). Struck up a good conversation with the bartender and some of the locals as we were waiting for our food.   Not a huge menu selection although the food was very good. Try one of their burgers or their corned beef sandwich. Hand cut fries were the bomb.  Good selection of beers including seasonals. Handshake from the bartender on the way out. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries. Very limited menu, but good. The wait staff was a bit slow and seemed to take care of the bar, and not the people sitting in the booths/tables. I'd give it another go as the person I was with was really rather a jerk and unpleasant may have colored my experience."}
{"text":"This is a bar owned and operated by a friend of ours that graduated with us from high school. I believe his brothers are also owners which keeps he family feel in the place. This is a true Irish pub and they still believe in buy backs which is very cool. Kevin loves to announce toasts and offers UFC fights, etc to draw the crowds. When I am visiting town I always make a stop in so we can get a group of us together and turn up a few like we did when we were younger and all together. After a few we start to think we are those same young guys again which makes the night even crazier! A lot of regulars at this place so everyone is friendly and makes my visits enjoyable. I look forward to my visit next month!"}
{"text":"Decent little place to have a few drinks!  The staff was very friendly and didn't make my husband and me feel out of place being the only people there who didn't know everyone in the room.  My only request: keep playing the Irish music!  It was nice to hear it in the background--- we can go to ANY (and *sadly*  almost EVERY) other bar and hear Nickleback, Lady Gag-gag and all the other trash called \"pop music\"."}
{"text":"I rarely, if ever, like Irish bars. It's not because I have anything against you Mick's or anything. And I don't like to generalize but many Irish-American pubs are all the same. Celtic knots on the walls, shamrocks splattered all over the place, digital countdowns to St. Patty's Day, leprechaun puke on the floor.   But any way, I really like Croagh Patrick's. It's got a really chill vibe. Great lighting, cool people, and more beer to choose from than just Guinness and Smithwick's. Friendly bartenders that actually pay attention to you -- and like Alison T. mentioned, they will call you by name and even remember you next time. Very cozy and relaxing kind of place. I may have to hang here more often.   Don't ask me about the food because I drank my dinner. But, I hear it's pretty damn good from some reliable food snobs that frequent the place."}
{"text":"So, I'm not Irish, and I've never been to Ireland, but I'm pretty good at drinking beer - and this is a great place to do it.    It's not too big - probably 10 or 15 barstools and seating for 30 max - and can turn into a packed, standing-room-only party later in the evenings, particularly on weekends or days with major sporting events.  It's a great place to catch a quiet drink and really good homemade food on a Saturday afternoon though, and can be surprisingly family-friendly during off-peak hours.    The guys behind the bar are friendly and personable, and even if it's your first time there they'll get to know you by name.  They have a great selection of bottled beers and a few Irish standards on tap.  If you're hungry, you can't go wrong with the Reuben.  Not ready to tackle a huge sandwich?  Then try the corned beef eggrolls - yum!"}
{"text":"Not 5/5 because I didn't order food.   Stopped in late night last week to grab a beer.  Beer was reasonable, music was good, maybe slightly too loud.  It was difficult to keep a conversation, but that's my personal preference.    Owner came up to say hi and to see if we needed anything, Class act,   Small place, but super Irish, would stop in here again for a beer and maybe this time try their food!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood Irish pub that I only wish was in my neighborhood. That would make it perfect, but I gave it 5 stars anyway.   There were plenty of TVs in view from any seat. There was a live 5 member band playing that had a bluegrass folk type style. The volume was pleasant. You could still carry on a conversation with out yelling and the talent was enjoyable.  Upon grabbing a seat at the bar we were promptly welcomed by the barkeep with a hand shake and introduction. Throughout our visit, he carried on conversation and interacted with every patron making us feel all like family even encouraging us to interact with each other. The environment was very social and welcoming. The place was clean, the pours were generous enough and the pricing spot on.   The craft beer by the bottle list was extensive plus there were a few on tap along with the usuals. There was an impressive selection of flavored liquors as well as multiple distilleries represented in their selection.   The menu focused on corned beef, potatoes and burgers with a couple specials on the blackboard. The food is all made from scratch. Very impressive! We tried the Irish egg rolls and one of the burgers with fresh cut fries. For bar food, it was excellent with good flavor. Everything we saw coming out of the kitchen smelled and looked fresh and tasty.   We had two craft beers, four rocks pours of whiskey, the egg rolls and burger with fries for $51 including tax. The value and vibe will bring us back!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat in pubs as I defer my appetite for food in exchange for drink when I'm out on the piss, so I cannot weigh in on the food at \"Croagh Pat's\" yet, but perhaps in the future. As it stands, this is a great pub to get your drink on. It is a \"cozy\" atmosphere, which tends to make for a better experience than other bars in the area as you are nudged ever so slightly into the time honored Irish (and English) tradition of \"being merry\", which can be loosely translated as \"socializing.\" Prepare to walk into this pub a and be greeted rather than simply acknowledged. You will not find that at another pub in Willoughby-sad to say. The bartenders are attentive and are eager to secure your patronage in forthcoming visits...that happens in a family run pub like this.        A previous reviewer claims to have problems with the pub's 'authenticity'... I must say I have been on the piss at several Irish bars across the world, in the UK, Germany, Spain, Dubai, Thailand, Turkey and about a dozen airports. There are always some people who will have problems with an Irish pub's \"authenticity\", when in reality, these people would not be pleased unless the bar has 5 alcoholics dressed in green imported straight from Belfast, heavy Northern Ireland accent in tow, a bar wench with bright red hair and freckles, and a cobblestone parking lot outside with a heavy wooden door. But alas, these things are not what makes a pub an \"Irish Pub\" All an Irish Pub is is simply a place where friends meet and troubles are left at the door, that happens to serve a good pint. Calling into question the 'validity of authenticity' by questioning if the proprietors (who happen to be Irish-American) have ever been to Ireland is pretty ridiculous. Next time you want to complain about this, step into my shoes and drink at an \"authentic\" Irish bar in Dubai and get your pint served by a Pakistani who couldn't point Ireland out on a map.  If you're done complaining and you want a good pint, go see the boys at Croagh Pat's and they'll sort you out."}
{"text":"Like the Anti Nowhere Leage \"For You\" song goes:  \"For you   Well I'll be your soldier   For you   I'll bury friends   For you   Well I'll be your saviour   For you   I'll play and pretend \"  That's how I feel about this little pub buried amongst suburban strip mall hell.  Every time I come here I have strong drink, good conversation (with bartenders that ACTUALLY chat with customers) and good pub grub.  Always lots of regulars and a couple of random drunks, yuppies and people meeting on clandestine hookups.  If dark but just dark enough to make everyone look a lot better looking.  I hate to break it to folks but corned beef is not Irish, its Jewish and this is in my top 3 favorite corned beef I've had this side of Dublin, er' New Yorks Lower East Side.  Jukebox has corny Irish music and pop music but hey this IS the suburbs after all.  It cant all be Charley And The Bhoys and The Nips can it?        feicfidh mé ar ball thú"}
{"text":"Boy, the Croagh's first review for Yelp.  So much to say but I really want to keep it simple.  This is an Irish Pub at its finest.  Rated #1 in 2009 and looking like a repeat.  I truly enjoy the atmosphere that the owners provide.  Kevin, McPat, Bobbie, Seamus, and the rest of the crew are just great.  Come in for food, fun, or to watch the game.  Don't be afraid to ask about the dice game either.  I'm in!!  Food is wonderful for this little pub.  The corned beef is top notch, daily specials never falter, burgers are big and tasty, and they even have 'hot nuts'.    You'll hear some recent music along with a little blast from the past and of course Irish drinking tunes.  There's also a juke so don't be afraid to put your own spin on entertainment.  Come in for a Guinness or a Smithwicks; specials are run for most of the major sports games even all college games on Saturday.  I feel like I should be getting paid to advertise this place.  Be out on the look for their new place opening in downtown Willoughby."}
{"text":"fantastic taco tuesday special, $1 per taco, each comes with beef, letuce,cheese,sour cream and alittle spicy taco sauce. hard or soft, both are great, ask for extra taco sauce on the side for an extra kick"}
{"text":"Wonderful establishment. Food is amazing.  I recommend the egg rolls.  Sooooo good with their homemade Russian dressing! Gnocchi tots are a go to favorite.  You can't go wrong with any of the menu options here!"}
{"text":"Best Irish Pub in the World! Hands Down! Family owned and operated w people who care about their customers! Handshakes and smiles always and the pub food is great!!"}
{"text":"A great little local Irish bar with exceptional pub food. Come here, eat, drink, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic bar in Cleveland Ohio ask for Santa or Justin Bobby they're amazing they will make your trip to that pub the best trip and best day of your life I promise you."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is most awesome no matter what you order. Burgers, wings, corned beef. They have the best! Happy hour pricing is unbeatable, and their coolers produce the coldest beer allowed by law. To top it off, the bartenders are super friendly and attentive."}
