{"text":"Le restaurant est petit et un peu vieux mais la nourriture est vraiment excellent. Par contre, il ne sont pas capable d'accommoder les demandes de leur clients. Par exemple, j'ai demander d'enlever les olives de ma sauce, ce qui m'a été refusé car la sauce était faite d'avance. Un collègue a demandé de changer un ingrédient pour un autre et ça lui a été refusé aussi. Pas capable d'avoir du pain a l'ail avec mes pâtes non plus. Malgré se désagrément, les plats sont super et les portions généreuses! Je recommande."}
{"text":"Neighborhood pizza joint that's been here forever!! Tuesday nite dinner during hockey playoffs and still had room, though noisier and quite spirited (Go Habs Go!!). Half liter of house red, piccata limone for the better half and Franco pizza for me. Amazing service, grey tasting food, still one if the best restos in the area. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Very generous on the toppings. And I only took the traditional pepperoni and cheese, but also added some sweet sweet italian sausage. Service was good. Food was delicious. Referred by TSN90s Tony Marinaro and this guy knows his stuff. Give it a shot and you'll score a good meal or two. Go Habs Go!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Easily one of the best in Montreal. (Tried the cadanese)

Disgusting Pasta. It tasted cheap and the sauce tasted as if it was out of a can. 
(Tried the fetuccini with tomato sauce and Italian sausage)

I recommend avoiding the pasta and simply going for the pizza."}
{"text":"Elio's,wow were do i start.i am 49 years old and I've been coming here for 40 years.that says it all.Amazing pizza,sauce wow so good always take a jar home with me.every time i come to Elio's its like coming home.hello to all the family...love this place"}
{"text":"My go to place for picky eaters, nobody ever complained about the food here, never had a bad meal here! 
Hands down THE best:
-lasagna !
-tortolinis
-pizza !
-FETTUCCINI CARBONNARA!!!!
-manicotis 
-soups (if u go over lunch!)

I would go everyday if I could afford a 17$ lunch everyday. ! 

I love Elio I always buy their to go sauce and pastas to take care of my craving when I'm home!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious.  They know how to make there crust hearty, yet light and we'll cooked underneath.  One thing though, if you do not like Tomato sauce with a bit of a kick, you may be disappointed.  Choose other pizzas without red sauce.  Oh, and bring an appetite because the portions are family hungry man size.  Excellent Pizza for the aficionados of traditional* style pizza.  If your Italian, or like spicy foods, there Pizza Sauce  is on the spicy side.  Crust is the key.  Depending on the time of the day, they are most of the time flexible with modifying your pizza toppings.  Take out or Eating in, you Simply CAN'T go wrong at Elio's...  A lot of Restaurants can't say that any more.  They treat you right, and for the money it's simply one of the best bangs for the buck."}
{"text":"Authetic Family resto, place is full of Italians.
If you love their sauce, you'll love all their dishes."}
{"text":"Best Lasagna I've ever had! Pizza's amazing too! To be truthful I've been going here for years and I've never been disappointed. Friendly atmosphere, fast service, large portions. Always busy, so expect to wait a bit if you arrive after 5:30pm."}
{"text":"I attended this pizzeria with friends last week. Even though it was a Wednesday, the restaurant, quiet at first, quickly became a loud and bustling place.

We were waited on by a slightly irritated looking man. Pasta, pizza, and other carbs were in the menu the waiter dropped on the table.

The rumor is that this Italian restaurant is one run by \"authentic\" Italians. The thin-crust pizza is delicious, and the toppings are light. I had the equivalent of their Table D'Hote, which came with a soup. They brought buns out for everyone. In the end, they brought us a crispy dessert that came with the table d'Hote.

I had ordered a soft drink, and then, when I requested a second one at the end of the evening, they charged me for both. So buyer beware! ;-)  There are no refills here.

I don't think I would come here alone. I think I would feel like I was irritating them by my presence. In a group, the irritation would be diffused over the crowd... which is safer.

I saw children there, and couples, and very large groups. Our food didn't take long to prepare. The price for a pizza (table d'hote) was 20$. Considering how the pizza was a full pizza, this seemed decent for a sit-down place. With drinks, tips and taxes, though, this meal turned into a 33$ affair.

I don't think I would go back, though, with a young family. It would add up quite quickly."}
{"text":"La pizza est savoureuse mais évitez à tout prix les plats de pâtes trop cuites et trop salées qui donneront à votre estomac quelques moments de travail intense. Loin d'être un resto mémorable et aucune envie d'y revenir"}
{"text":"Good value for your money although not always consistent in the food quality. This is not a place to impress your date, it's very casual. I have been coming here ever since it was just a hole in the wall and will keep coming back. Trust me, you will not leave this place hungry because of the generous portions."}
{"text":"What does it take for a restaurant like Elio to lose interest in their customers??? I used to be a fan of this place.  I had not visited the said address for about 2 years, and now the quality of the food, the cleanliness, even the house wine has left a very bad taste in my mouth... I ordered the pescatore pastas and I couldn't even engulf 6 bites: the shrimps (even the smaller ones) were tougher than rubber, the clams felt like they had not been rinsed, the linguini was over-cooked... both my glasses of water and wine were filthy.  No one asked me why I could not finish my meal, and were acting like they could not care less about my surprised expression at the table... I was simply stunned. And so disapointed to have lost what used to be one of my favorite italian eateries of all time.  I left bummed and hungry."}
{"text":"L'endroit peut être pas mal bruyant mais c'est toujours un plaisir d'y manger en famille... même si le service est parfois ordinaire. Les pâtes sont super bonnes bien que trop salées. Sur place, je suis un fan fini des pizzas à pâte fine. À emporter, les pizzas - medium à environ 15 dollars ou large à environ 20 dollars - sont toujours gagnantes pour un souper avec des amis."}
{"text":"A lot of people will argue about which restaurant is better, Elio or Napoletana. I'm a big fan of both and they each have their own styles. I tend to prefer the quiet and more remote location of Elio, including the fact that it looks like an authentic old fashioned Italian restaurant, somewhat forgotten with time, in the sense that it is situated in an area of La Petite Patrie which has not been frequented by the hipsters (yet). I also love that right across the street is old Catelli pasta factory building. 

There's been a bad wrap about this place concerning the service from waiters but personally I've never had any issues. I'm the type of client who will never return to a location if I come across any snobbish attitude and Elio is a place I continue to frequent. I have always been served courteously. 

I haven't tried everything on their menu but their pizza is delicious and I can say that I've never had a better carbonara!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food.
Great friendly staff.
I would definitely recommend this restaurant, but if you're a big group I would definitely reserve since the line tends to get big in the evening."}
{"text":"Jeudi soir mes amies et moi ne sachant pas trop où aller avons décider de souper ici pour ses prix raisonnable et la variétés des plats disponible ici. Nous sommes arrivé vers 8h30 sans réservation , avons été placés immédiatement . 

Le serveur nous a amené une corbeille avec du pain chaud, mais semblait beaucoup plus intéressé au match de hockey des canadiens qu'a ses clients. 

Nous avons commander nos plats, sont arrivés tout de même assez vite. Le veau a la milanaise avec les pâtes du jours , l'on a le choix de la sauce que ce soit à la viande, rosé ou au tomates. Mes amies ont toutes les deux prix la tables d'hôtes plats principal osso bucco qui a leurs dire était excellent. Pour ma part j'ai adoré la viande croustillante à souhait , les pâtes étant bonne sans plus j'aurais aimé un peu de verdure avec l'assiettes et surtout du VRAI fromage parmesan pour un restaurant authentique c'est un must.

Pour conclure très bonne viande de très bonne portion et un prix plus que respectable. Je n'ai mis que 2 * car le service était très banal j'avais l'impression de déranger le serveur il nous à amener les factures sans nous le demander, ni nous offrir un dessert ou un café  c'est empressé de nous faire payer et a commencer a parler très fort à nos côtés. Le message était clair.

Mis à part le service bon restau je reviendrais sûrement pour leurs pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing italien food, amazing pizza ( all dress and sea food pizza are my all time favorite). The service is amazing as well. The owner Frank is really friendly!!"}
{"text":"Wow excellent resto , nous avons un meeting de vente et bravo service , repas ambiance, merci a notre VP d'avoir prit ce resto"}
{"text":"Peu recommandable.  Nous y avons été en groupe de 4 un midi et le serveur a pris plus dune heure pour nous servir.  La nourriture est arrivée froide et la soupe était tiède.

Le service a été très mauvais et aucune compensation nous a été offerte.

Je déconseille aux gens d'y aller sur l'heure du dîner"}
{"text":"Gargantuan portions, ok service and the decor is stuck in the 80's.

But the food is what matters to me.
The pizza-ghetti is a 10\" pizza and a full pound of pasta, so much meat in their abondaza. For about $14, it's enough for 2 people, or 3.
I wish I could say the dough is that heavenly dough dreams are made of, but it's pretty generic, sort of like the square pizzas sold in supermarkets. But when it's fresh, it's good.

Their steaks are ridiculously cheap and did I mention the portions.

This place is located in front of a city bus depot and there is a courthouse and a large office tower a block away, so that could explain why they're always packed most of the time.   

The location might seem a bit isolated, but so many plusses in it's favor (private parking lot) and it's one block away from both Beaubien and Rosemont Metro."}
{"text":"I had a delicious greasy pepperoni pizza with cannolis for dessert. Don't expect anything too fancy inside but you won't be disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"My folks grew up going to Elio's - so it's been around a LONG time, and is still owned by Elio's family. Luckily for me, my parents shared this gem of a restaurant with me  years ago :)

So first, don't expect fancy decor because I don't think they've redecorated since they opened the restaurant 30 years ago. This is a really traditional, family-style restaurant with no bells and whistles. The focus is on the FOOD. If you get there past 5pm on a weekend, you can expect a line-up.  That said, you can call ahead to order takeout.

In my opinion, Elio makes the best pizza in town. They're not cheap on the toppings, and I find their all-dressed to be a well-rounded mix of pepperoni, bell pepper, mushrooms and cheese. The crust is perfect - not too thick. I also appreciate that their crust is never wet like some places!  Their pasta dishes are equally good, with my favorite being the cavatelli. I'm not sure if they make their own pasta but if not, the guy they get it from does a real good job of giving me that illusion!  Elio's sauce is so good that I never leave the resto without buying a jar or two. Yup, Elio stocks the front fridge with sauce and a few pastas for those of us who want to bring some home. 

Elio offers a few different pastas and sauces that you can 'mix and match' if you like. They are very generous with their portions, so you'll leave there with a Buddha belly and quite possibly, a doggy bag. As well, their prices are super affordable. 

What are you waiting for? GO!"}
{"text":"Went there recently with friends for dinner and was shocked by the lack of service all around. The music was loud and out of date. I left with getting my meal. I will never go back here ever. again."}
{"text":"Elio's is another reliable staple that appears to be close enough to Petite Italie, or Little Italy.  It's a little west of the main arteries and in a more gruff looking area, but it has been there a long time.  It came recommended.

As for whether or not it is authentically Italian, it is!  Interacting with the waiters will soon enough confirm that.  The other thing is that this is almost more of a pizzeria that happens to be an Italian restaurant, rather than the other way around.  That said, their Italian fare is respectable.  The main pasta dish itself was better than the accompaniments.  

As to why they're not getting a 4, it's for a couple of reasons.  The more a la carte nature of the menu kicked up the price a little more than was expected.  It wasn't overpriced but, collectively, it wasn't a good value, either.  Also, echoing what others have said, the service by the waiters wasn't the best and mirrored what you might see in southern Italy - brusque, punchy, humorous, casual, quick, and indifferent, making you wonder if they just got off the boat last week.

If in Petite Italie or thereabouts, I would default to Tre Marie, which is more of a restaurant than a pizzeria.  Having eaten at Tre Marie twice over the years, I still dream about it.  I hope they still make mouth watering meals.

Let me end with a quip about these guys, much like there was a quip about the Pope and sexual matters decades ago which went: \"If he no play da game, he no make-a da rules.\"  For Elio's, I'd say, \"If dey no watch-a da hockey, dey pay-a more attention and do a betta job.\"  But ok, I get it - \"Go Canadiens!\""}
{"text":"Elio pizzeria is definately a must go to place if you are looking for great wood oven pizza. There is a reason why this resto has been around for so long and is always super busy. The service is super warm and Frank the manager really does make his customers feel at home. The resto has recently undergone major renovations and the decor is now truly awesome and trendy. It also now has TV's so great for watching sports. I definately recommend this place for small family parties, birthday parties or friend's get to together as they have affordable group menu options @ 32$ / person or 37$/person which includes choice of 3 entrees, choice of main dish and includes coffee, dessert and soft drinks! Quality of food is great from the pizza's to the pasta's ....their wonderful dishes will keep you coming back for more!  They also have live musicians Friday and Saturday nights playing tradional italian music."}
{"text":"The pros = the pizza & the big portions

Cons= arrogant owner and poor service.
            also pasta is too salty"}
{"text":"I love that this is one of the Italian restaurants that everyone knows. There is usually a wait if you're a big table but 2 people rent a problem. Staff is friendly but rough around the edges. I understood the stress though because it was a full house. They're calamari was basic and nothing worth mentioning. Batter was lacking in seasoning but crunch was definitely there. I order their meat lover pizza and one of my biggest pet peeves is if the sauce and cheese doesn't reach the edges of the pizza. I need a pizza that can hold the toppings, stays crispy on the bottom and has a good crust. I didn't think the thin crust pizza was able to hold the toppings and honestly the flavours were lacking. I was expecting more from such a well known restaurant. I would go back to try other things."}
{"text":"The food has been great for years and the prices are overall fair but the service is something of an acquired taste...it comes off as someone is doing you a favor of serving you....no smiles to be seen...everything is impersonal and mechanical.the place does look great since the renos."}
{"text":"Very casual,always very crowded in the evenings, you have to get in line and wait for your turn to be seated,should a spot come up and it's your turn. The decor probably has never been changed since the 50's, the noise and wait staff hustling and bustling level is high. As for the food,I've only ever had their all dressed pizza,of which I am not a fan,but must say, this one was very good. Crust not too thick,not soggy and the pepperoni not greasy or spicy. I did not feel that I could relax and enjoy my meal,as all the wait staff shouting and running back and forth made me feel rushed and pressured to finish and leave, so that other customers still waiting in line could have a table."}
{"text":"Consistently tasty and affordable food AND within walking distance of anywhere in the plateau. I recommend the pizza/pasta combo. Portions are big enough to share. Wish they had a delivery service though."}
{"text":"Great food and the hospitality was fantastic. They treated us like family. The owner came over and talked with us a couple of times. We were treated really good."}
{"text":"Pour notre repas dominical nous avons choisi ce restaurant car nous avions une grosse envie de pizza ! Bien nous en a pris car le choix a été largement validé.

Nous avons pris chacun la table d'hôte qui donne droit à une entrée, une multitude de plat et un cannoli en dessert.
Au niveau des plats il y avait le choix et cela oscillait entre 18 et 25$ suivant si vous preniez par exemple une pizza ou des plats plus cuisinés (osso buco, crevettes, ...).

J'ai pris pour ma part une pizza all dressed en pâte épaisse (10') qui était vraiment délicieuse, garnie abondamment et avec des bons ingrédients.
Laura avait pris une pizza à pâte fine (arugola) avec roquette, parmesan et tomate cerise. Supers pizzas.
Ils peuvent aussi vous proposer une sauce piquante faite maison très bonne, n'hésitez pas à la demande au serveur ;-)

Nous avions tellement mangé qu'au final nous avons pris le cannoli à emporter pour le soir et il était tout à fait bon même après avoir passé l'après midi dans un sac à dos à 28 degrés et après de long km en vélo :-)

Au niveau du cadre il n'y a rien d'exceptionnel à l'intérieur, nous étions tranquillement en terrasse et nous avons pu profiter de notre repas au calme et à température parfaite. En prime nous avons eux le droit à un \"arrivage\" de motards avec de superbes Harley qui venaient manger !

Concernant le budget avec la tables d'hôte je ne trouve pas prix dispendieux, les prix sinon sont dans la moyenne.

Ce fut une bonne expérience et je pense que nous y retournerons et nous pourrons le conseiller à nos amis. La prochaine fois on essayera de tester autre chose bien que les pizzas soient bonnes :)"}
{"text":"One of my classic, affordable, comfort food spots in the area. I like to sit on the patio in the summer, dip the fresh lovely rolls in the homemade giardinera, order massive plates of pasta and pizzas to share and take home glorious quantities of leftovers. I've always found the service here enjoyable, they start out brusque but warm up to you over the course of the meal if you have a friendly rapport, and end up fairly hilarious and super kind. Like any good Italian family meal, or so I imagine. =)"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over 40 years. Every time I come to Montreal, this place is on my list to eat,  just love their food, especially the pizza. I've noticed the place had just been renovated, the waiters and waitresses are really nice and love the new look of the restaurant. This is a hidden gem on bellechasse street. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the kind of old-fashioned Italian restaurant that I love!  Brightly lit, well-worn menus with lots of options, 1920's building and decor and friendly and attentive service.

The pizza was first rate as was an order of spaghetti carbonara (prepared in the correct manner without cream).  Osso bucco was tender and toothsome and starters of grilled shrimp and bruschetta were both terrific.  They were 86 on a couple of choices but that is only a paean to their evident popularity.  Great cappuccino too,

Dinner for four without dessert but with a bottle of house wine (a very decent red Abruzzese selection, BTW) and with espresso/cappuccino came to only 128.50 and we were stuffed.

We look froward to returning on our next visit to Montreal"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said? I love this place. My go to place for amazing pizza and pasta! I never ever had a bad meal here. 

It's loud, proud and Italian! For large groups reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"Another old-school Montréal institution. The kind of place where they don't care much for food cost and just slap so much toppings on a pie that the pizza will likely defeat you. They also have lighter pizza like the sausage and spinach pizza which was awesome. Then there's the ravioli. Nothing fancy here, just damn tasty cheesy HOMEMADE ravioli. Which they sell by the bag, worth the walk just to get those back home.

The service is rushed and dry but who cares, you go there to grub for lunch, shoot the shit and get out."}
{"text":"After a trip in Italy, I've become a not-so big fan of local (Montreal) Italian food because I found it does not provide good value for the money (compared to Italy), but I was extremely pleased with Elio Pizzeria. Phone reservation went without a hitch and the tables were ready as expected. The service was lively, prompt and efficient. The food portions were impressively large (entrees, as well as the pizza-pasta combo). The food was delicious. The dining room was clean and modest. The prices were better than I expected for the portion sizes. Elio Pizzeria is easily accessibly via Metro. Again, I'm genuinely impressed and now a big fan of this place for groups of friends."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this review with saying that I like Elio's escalope de veau à la milanaise so much that I thought about it every single day the week after I went there. It was a dream meal for me, this crispy breaded pan fried veal with spaghetti in tomato sauce. It's like a kids' meal in an adult portion. 

It did took us awhile to get seated. When we got there, around 7.30pm on a Saturday evening, the place was in full swing and the manager was teaching his son tricks and tips to handle the pressure. We started with bread and it was served warm, which for me is a real plus plus. Then came the calamari, which was good on its own (though a tad oily), but was absolutely fantastic when dipped into the accompanying tomato sauce. It was a very unique taste, this tomato sauce, and it reminded me of the tomato sauce I had at a greek restaurant recently. And finally the superstar of the night for me, the veal, just made that evening better and better. For dessert, we had a canoli, which was also unbelievably good, even though by this time my stomach was already screaming, \"Enough is enough!\"

I will go back 1000 times and recommend everybody who likes their genuine, family run Italian restaurants to give this place a try."}
{"text":"Service was so so. Food average italian. The pizzas are ok. Pastas are good. Nothing special sorry."}
{"text":"Un grand classique du quartier. La nourriture goûte souvent comme à la casa di nonna le dimanche après-midi. Je dis souvent, parce que des fois le goût n'y est pas, il manque de quelque chose. Le midi par exemple c'est moins bon, plus gras que d'habitude. Mais c'est quand même meilleur que ben d'autres resto italien. On y va dans un esprit de partage, les portions sont généreuses, tellement abordables et il faut gouter à plusieurs plats. La pizza à la roquette et la salade maison peuplent mes rêves parfois, c'est comme un bec en pincette de grand-maman italienne, doux, réconfortant pis un peu piquant!"}
