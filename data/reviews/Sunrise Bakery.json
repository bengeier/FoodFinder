{"text":"Sunrise is alive and well.  They have been offering hot breakfast and lunch sandwiches this summer.  Lemon bars are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Donuts were a bit above average, but I have had better. I would go here over Dunkin Donuts. The woman that waited on me was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Love this bakery the owner always has her family helping her i love the customer service here the baked goods are soooo good i cant believe they are ALL Fresh! And homemade!"}
{"text":"Decent doughnut. Kinda pricey.  Just bought a dozen at 8:45 a.m.  Not a bad selection. All the standards. Crullers, Jelly filled, frosted...blah blah. Nothing real fancy nothing out of the ordinary either.  The decor looks like it hasn't been changed in 50 years but that's whatever.  The price was a little higher than expected.  $10 for 12 donuts (yeah not even the bakers dozen) and they really taste/feel like they were made last night.  Not, because it's dark out and most people are sleeping at 2-3 a.m., that sort of last night.  Like they made them around 11 p.m. last night.  They aren't horrible. They aren't great.  They would be really good if they were fresh...but they weren't.  So, the search for a good local doughnut continues.  These are much better than DD's light, tiny, not much to them, doughnuts.  And I would bet money that the folks here only use PC's (let alone smartphones) to check their AOL. And a Web presence?? (you're joking right?)"}
{"text":"Not an exaggeration they have the best doughnuts I have ever had, but get there early because they go fast.  I also find the ladies working there in the morning are so friendly."}
{"text":"From homemade breads and pastries to specialty doughnuts, Sunrise Bakery is a normal Sunday morning stop. The kids are always impressed with the great creative doughnuts and you can't go wrong with fresh breads!"}
{"text":"Mary Jo, one of the owners was very friendly while assisting us in our selection of her bakery products. I write this as I partake in a wonderfully crumbly coffee cake. How could anyone compare this to Dunkin Donuts (as a previous poster had submitted)? I'd come back in a New York minute if I didn't live so far away."}
