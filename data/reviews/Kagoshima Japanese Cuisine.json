{"text":"Great Sushi and friendly Chef. Lovely price / performance."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Purely Chinese run but still pretty good sushi. Their salad dressing is pretty good, not gingery like most places. The best thing is that this place opens late!"}
{"text":"I have tried Japanese food from all over. This place is quite good. Not only is the service quick and friendly here but the food is truely delightful. Its not a fast food place so, if you plan to go here take your time. Great for groups. Delish!"}
