{"text":"The restaurant has only been open for a month and a half. I had the Americano Pizza which was very good. Service was good. It doesn't seem to be open many hours during the week. I think this restaurant is affected by foot traffic on the street. Probably better marketing would bring in more clientele"}
{"text":"The BEST pizza in Markham! Their pasta is also amazing, I highly recommend the penne arrabiata. I've had penne arrabiata in many restaurants, and theirs is by far the best.   The service is always warm and welcoming, it has a very friendly down to earth atmosphere. Prices are reasonable, especially for such delicious traditional food.   This is one of my top restaurants. I've moved away from Markham, but whenever I com back Unionville House will be one of the must go to restaurants with family and friends."}
{"text":"Athena D said it all! And beat me to the punch! How I love getting those first to review badges...  Unionville Mainstreet is a great place to go, winter or summer, to browse the shops, grab a bite and drink in some of that old Unionville charm! The Med House is a great place because it offers something a little different than most of the places on the main drag!  GREAT food, exceptional service, and all super fresh. I love me some fresh bread, and man did they deliver! Even for the picky eater, I had a tasty (and not everwhelming) chicken kebab and yummy greek salad. They have TONS to order from, and one of the best parts is the cozy family feel of the decor."}
