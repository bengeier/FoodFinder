{"text":"Elegant chocolate that are great for holiday gifts or bringing home something special for someone special..... chocolate will never taste the same after you've an 18 piece signature box that offer one of each of their featured flavors...the burnt Carmel and maple pecan are just made to perfection....something everyone can enjoy"}
{"text":"What a beautiful shop! The custom roasted coffee and coffee creations are amazing, especially the fruity pebble latte! 

I ordered boxes of chocolates for client gifts which were so well received because of the beautiful presentation and most delicious chocolates and macaroons!

The pastries, macaroons and chocolates are there some of the best I have had. Definitely make a point to try this!"}
{"text":"So I didn't actually buy from them, but my boss gave me a box of their chocolate's that she had. Let me tell you when opening the box I got a pleasant surprise. These are seriously the coolest/cutest chocolates I've ever see in my life.  Now we know looks aren't everything, but also these chocolates are probably the best chocolate's I've ate in my life.  There is such favor with each chocolate and I love how they are the most obscure flavors like thai spice and the chai one! 
They're freakin' delicious, that's all I gotta say."}
{"text":"Delicious horchata latte on ice, Amanda is on point with the horchata. The chocolates look amazing, each a work of art with no neglect on flavor. Definitely a fabulous chocolate perfect for gifting on any occasion sure to impress, but affordable enough to satisfy a passing sweet tooth. 
     We stopped in for a cool refreshing reprieve from the heat, and were welcomed with a friendly, casual, but still top notch customer service from the crew.  Seems like a great group of chocolatiers who love what they do. Thankfully they do offer shipping as I was concerned these delicious works of art would never have survived the rest of the day in the heat. The shop was also prepared to package my purchase in a bed of ice, which I was surprised but glad to hear. If you're just stopping by, you will be able take them all the way home without worry. 
     I'm thoroughly impressed and glad to hear the do business online. As a DC native I will definitely be wanting these beautiful chocolates again.  
      5/5 on all counts, customer service, quality, flavor, and value."}
{"text":"Purchased a bunch of these boxes as Christmas gifts this year. Everyone loves them. We even had a couple of boxes leftover for ourselves. Each chocolate had an exciting flavor and melts so deliciously in your mouth. They're worth the price! Beauty and flavor and nice packaging. Best chocolates I've ever had! Gift recipients agree!"}
{"text":"Head Turning Delicious

I brought a box of 18 to a Thanksgiving dinner. It was a huge hit! The chocolates are so beautiful and wrapped so nicely that we went around the table in a ritualistic manner choosing which ones to try first. They are all equally as wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm sad about some of the reviews about the service -- c'mon guys -- this is a local business without all the fancy schmancy stuff... I just tried the chocolate for the first time and bought the biggest most expensive box from the Artisan Food Guild location on 7th Street.  Yes, it's hard to find; and yes, it's pricey, but so far, this is the finest chocolate I've ever found in Phoenix or almost any city for that matter.  The ingredients are pristine, the chocolates look like the pictures -- so they are like pieces of beautiful art.  There are no preservatives, no chemicals, no refined anything, and only pure and delicious perfect and wonderful beautiful and carefully designed confections. I think the fact that these are a little difficult to get your hands on makes them a little more intriguing -- though I hope that I can jump over to Artisan Food Guild and get them again... I'm going to give a box or two as gifts.  If you try them, you will not be sorry -- be patient folks... this is a magical chocolate maker for sure -- it may be a while before this chocolate maker can make enough for everyone."}
{"text":"Chocolates are to die for, but someone seriously update the damn address . The correct address is 9014 N 23rd Ave #14, Phoenix, AZ 85021 and the owner is a super helpful guy who went out of his way to help me out with my order. The chocolates itself, like I said are phenomenal."}
{"text":"XO Confections is absolutely amazing!! They have the BEST customer service. The quality of their coffee and chocolates is ONE OF A KIND! I order several boxes of chocolates for my doctors and they are always packaged perfectly and my doctors are very impressed by the quality and the taste. Their coffee is a dream come true--it not only gives you that caffeine boost you need, but tastes delicious! I highly recommend stopping by XO Confections store in Oldtown, Scottsdale, you will be more than pleased!! Great job XO, excited to be a frequent flyer at your new store! Thanks for being so great!"}
{"text":"OMG...not only are their chocolates beautiful they are delicious!  Jason and his staff are very friendly and know how to create delectable confections."}
{"text":"These were a hit for Father's Day... I'm looking forward to you expanding your vegan flavors ... hopefully it's something you are considering!"}
{"text":"This review isn't on the chocolate, but on the lack of service and misinformation. My sister and I found this place on Yelp and wanted to buy some cool chocolate for our mom. The address on Yelp seemed weird, so we called the number to confirm, but no answer. We cross-checked the address on the official site and it matched up, so we decided to make the drive. After 25 minutes of driving we ended up in the middle of a residential area. NO businesses. What the heck? We called the number again and still no answer. We went back on the website and it said there's some vendor locations, but we were a little too frustrated to bother driving 45 minutes out to a vendor location after the first location proved to be nothing. 

Come on man, keep your info updated or at least answer your phone. I'll update my review if I ever get around to trying the chocolate, which I was really looking forward to!"}
{"text":"I had received XO chocolates as a gift before stopping by their store, so I already knew their chocolates are incredible!! My favorite is their Lord Bergamot chocolate that is Earl Grey flavored.  I didn't realize their storefront is much more than just a chocolatier location! 

They serve nitro cold brew coffee, tons of pastries and of course their chocolates. I sampled a bit of their banana cream pie and ended up ordering one to go. It was so light and creamy, and not too sweet. I also ordered a 6-pack of macaroons that came in an awesome little gift box.

Their packaging is very sleek and makes their products very giftable. The interior of the store was very clean and chic as well. 

I had a great experience at XO -- the staff is very friendly! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful. The hipsters that run the place are super knowledgeable and friendly. The chocolates are phenomenal and gorgeous. Little pieces of art for your mouth. I had the oceana chocolate and the Venezuelan. The dark chocolate in the Venezuelan was 73% but not at all bitter, in fact it was soft and creamy. Daaaannngerous. If you're a chocolate girl this is the spot.

Perfect place to stop for a lovely decadent treat -beautiful pastries and lattes- and a coffee for a girls date or a mother daughter stop or just a Magic lovely yum spot. 

They ship internationally. Perfect gift."}
{"text":"I didn't eat a single chocolate- but i gave my sister-in-law who is a world class expert in tobacco cessation AND chocolate and a more than a leetle bit picky about her bon-bons and she loved them- $ in the bank this are!"}
{"text":"I got these as a gift shipped to me from Arizona. I have never seen such beautiful chocolates.  Not only do they taste delicious, they look too beautiful to eat. I took my time with each bite to savor the flavor.  I read that the chocolates do not contain unnatural preservatives and do not use artificial flavors. I definitely recommend buying these chocolates.  They would be great as a gift or to serve to your guests. Whoever you give it to will definitely enjoy them!  You can order them and have them shipped to wherever which is great news considering I live in Chicago."}
{"text":"I must say I will never enjoy Russell Stover or See's or Cerreta's again. W Xocolatl has introduced to me the BEST chocolate I have savored this side of the Mississippi. Only they use stunning presentation that makes these morsels ALMOST too neat to eat. Only they employ superb quality and unique flavors that keep me up at night pondering my favorite. Perhaps it was the white chocolate with a banana-almond praline? Nonono, it's the Cinnamon Spice with Thai chili flakes. Okay, definitely that, but the new summer collection has Earl Grey, rum, lavender, or scotch infused confections too good to pass up. You won't even need to try more than a couple varieties to realize why I've given it five stars. 

If you can't make it to their location, they're distributing to some coffee shops in the north valley, but hopefully they can expand in every direction once they get settled in. I need my fix."}
{"text":"Bought these chocolates for my employees two years ago and they were a sensation!!!  Now, I am buying for a vendor who has gone out the way to help in an implementation -vendors give us gifts, we don't give them, but this vendor deserves Xocolatl!  AND, I have mostly new staff, so soon they will be getting a gift, too!  Last time the comments were consistent that these were just too beautiful to eat...but when they took a bite, they were soon gone!  Too delicious not to eat!"}
{"text":"Beautiful artistic gems, each one.
The highest quality confections combined with beautiful artistry.
Treat yourself next time you see them, they are worth every cent.
I found them at a Scottsdale Art Festival."}
{"text":"I've known the company for a little bit because I help out with the store they sell them in. These chocolates are hand crafted and truly beautiful. The owner, who has a military background is truly obsessed with perfection and it shows not only in their products, but also their packaging, their printed material, and their bow-ties. Inside and out, these chocolates are not only glistening, but they taste like their name intends. Each box holds an info box which shows all of the flavors.

I buy Wasser's chocolates for either close friends, people I like or people I'll never see again and give them a bit of Arizona magic. Though it is a bit pricey, I think the handmade expertise that Jason and his team puts into crafting each chocolate box is worth it."}
{"text":"I just had these chocolates at The Ultimate Women's Expo. I have to say that they are beautiful AND delicious! I love the look of them, so elegant! These would make a great gift!"}
{"text":"Superfine chocolate. Artful and delicious. They look almost too good to eat! Their $10 box of 4 chocolates makes a great little gift. 

I ordered several boxes online for presents which arrived very well-packaged within just a few days. These black boxes of chocolates had an impressive presentation with a gray satin ribbon and black tissue paper. I kept one of them to try, and they're quite filling but damn, I wish I bought a bigger box for myself! The chocolates are so perfect-looking with vivid colors, sheen, and designs I've never seen on anything edible with flavor combinations that are so effing good. 

My box happened to have Bananas Foster with a real banana/rum/brown sugar semisoft center in a bright yellow \"white\" chocolate shell, Cinnamon Pecan with a soft almond/pecan marzipan inside, Single Malt Scotch filled with a smooth 12-year-old scotch infused ganache, and Venezuelan Noir of 73% dark chocolate ganache. Some of my favorite people are getting this for Christmas from yours truly."}
{"text":"The one star is assigned because I have tried to become a customer however after calling twice (and leaving a message once, last Monday and not receiving a return call), I am scratching this place off my list. 

The address listed on 17th Avenue is a private residence and the address provided on 7th St. is affiliated with \"Artisan Food Guild Community Market.\" Unfortunately the pin guides you to the 17th Street address. The is no 9 - 5 hours there of which I am aware, but like I mentioned, a phone call back could have clarified and made us a happy customer as the chocolates look delicious. 

I'm giving up though."}
{"text":"Closed during business hours. Not picking up the phone. Drove 50 miles.  Recommend apparently calling them to see if they are actually there before bothering to head there.  We come into Phoenix rarely.  Very disappointed.

Apparently the address in Phoenix is not their store.   Raised from 1 star to three for calling to tell but still 2 stars down for inaccurate information on yelp."}
{"text":"What amazing chocolate truffles, gourmet, hand-crafted. Also friendly people, upscale and yet relaxed environment, and incredible sweets and coffees. The creative flavor combinations are incredible!"}
{"text":"Specialty coffee: The Horchata Latte is phemon! Special-Tea: The Uh-Huh Honey is delish! Can't go wrong with ANY of the chocolates! And the staff is beyond amazing. Super friendly. Can't wait to come back when I visit the Southwest again!"}
