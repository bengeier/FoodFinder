{"text":"Definitely will go back for the pizza alone!

Mira Kuru is not really an Italian-Japanese fusion restaurant; the menu mostly separates the Italian & Japanese dishes, with only a small number of fusion items. There are plenty of vegetarian dishes to go with the fish and meat. I decided to go with the Italian & let my dining partner do the Japanese side. We both ended up happy, although with some qualifications. 

I am on a minestrone kick recently, so that was my starter, and it was ok. Unfortunately, they perched the large piece of toast (sun dried tomato & herbs, I think) on the side of the large & deep soup plate, so it was pretty soggy from the soup slopping up the sides as it was carried up the stairs. Not an attractive dish, but an ample one, fairly fresh tasting. 

Pizza is very good! Neither thin nor really thick, the bottom was crisp even once it had been sitting for a while. I went with the margherita, and will happily order again. Good sauce, tasty slice, and a good value at $12 for the small. I took the remainder home. 

My partner had the rainbow roll and several pieces of nigiri. He found the fish very fresh & the roll (with real crab) very flavourful. The rice did not hold together, however. 

Service was a bit spotty but not terrible. 

Website says the happy hour special is $5 wine, but we were told it was actually $4 pints (20 oz. proper pints, in fact). Yet my $9 glass of wine was billed at $4. Not sure if that was because I mentioned the soggy toast (although I said I was not complaining or asking for any compensation. You think they would tell me if they were comping me, right?) Anyway, yay for affordable booze!

Sadly, not accessible, as they have a lot of stairs."}
{"text":"I love this place we have been here twice so far and neither time was a disappointment!! Pizza is a must every visit! Sausage and Mexican pizza were so good. The second time had the bento box which was a lot of food for a very decent price. A whole variety of different Japanese/Italian cuisine which are two of my most favourite foods, so who can go wrong really?! It is not 100% fusion though and I've seen other reviews about the place trying to find an identity however this place has definitely came a long way from what was here before and I can tell the owners must have spend a lot on the decor, overall it is a great environment, it's elegant. My favourite spot is the booth for sure I love that huge window! Food presentation is beautiful, service was great, I can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"came here with a group of friend, the service was bad to be honest, but the food makeup for it i guess. I would give a 4 star if it wasn't the service we got that night when we go to this place"}
{"text":"A Japanese-Italian fusion restaurant with  a great happy hour, some interesting flavour combinations, and a nice uncrowded patio. First off, where else on 17th Ave can you sit on a patio and get a 20oz. pint of beer (rotating, but we've had Wild Rose Velvet Fog and Guinness), or 6oz. pours of good red and white wine for $4?! Real fruit margaritas are $5, all of this from 3-7pm.

This isn't just a watering hole though. The sushi is very carefully prepared and presented, and at a nice price point for the quality. One fusion item we've had is the perogies and karaage chicken, an interesting twist on the ever popular chicken & waffles trend. The chicken bites were was moist, with a crispy exterior. The perogies were clearly house made, with a nice and tender lightly pan-fried dough envelope around the fluffy potato-cheese filling. The drizzled sauces were slightly spicy and sweet, and the crossover green onion accoutrement brought the two cultures together.

The tonkotsu was straight up Japanese, and while the broth was good, it wasn't the best we've had in town. The noodles were good (my wife thought they were slightly overcooked though), but the sliced pork was disappointingly lean and overcooked compared to a lot of great char siu at other ramen shops around town. While the hard cooked smoked egg was interesting to look at, I'd have preferred a soft yolk preparation, or even a jellied onsen egg.

MiraKuru: take advantage of happy hour and the patio, go for the sushi and the fusion, skip the tonkotsu unless you like hard eggs and lean pork."}
{"text":"Let me start off with the punchline: I am DELIGHTED to have high quality sushi mere blocks away! The fish was tender and flavorful, and generously cut, for a very reasonable price. My only niggles here would be the rainbow roll, which was delicious and huge, had a tad too much goop on the inside, and coupled with the rice's annoying inability to stick well, made for messy eating. But, once shoveled into my mouth, delightful!

Billed as \"Italian-Japanese Fusion\" its more a case of dueling sides of the menu (the trifold style menu they use reinforces this impression). All of the food I tasted was delicious though. My partner tried the Italian side, and let me sample a slice of her pizza. It is fantastic: crust perfectly done, flavourful, sauce with a sharp tomato taste (will be great to try with summer tomatoes in peak condition), cheese nice if a bit too much.

The place itself seems to be trying to find an identity. I mentioned the conflicting menu, but the decor too is struggling to find itself. The textured white walls and dark wood trim and furnishings from its days as Galla are still around, but now featuring wall hangings reinforcing the Italian side as they boldly declare \"pasta! spaghetti! meatballs!\". Large flatscreens have hockey on around the place so the fine dining also suggests bar. The lovely wine cellar is on display but the wines on offer probably should be drank sooner rather than held for multiple years. And reasonably loud pop/dance tunes add the final touch of incongruity to the scene. Service seems still pretty new, one server was pretty excited by the smells of all of the food coming onto the floor. For some reason we wound up with two different condiment trays--also beware, the soy sauce dispensers have a bit of a dribbling problem.

Still, the food is excellent, the chef well pedigreed, and I wish it good fortune for its future on 17th ave. I for one will be back for more (the ossobuco demands a try next I think)."}
{"text":"Interesting ideas. Execution leaves something to be desired.
The regular sushi and Italian dishes were good - the baked brie was especially excellent - but the fusion food was not well thought out at all. Udon Carbonara, while good flavours, was like eating glue texture wise - udon and cream sauce are not a good combination. The Fusion stew had so much clam juice in it that it was nearly inedible.
And the service was really, really slow, especially considering we were the only table in the joint on a Tuesday night. Poor value for the money. Not terrible, but I definitely wouldn't chose to eat there again.
At least the renovations look really nice?"}
{"text":"Thank you Lexi for a fantastic meal and dining experience. We can't wit for you to be 21 and go to Vegas. You have been an awesome server."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 6. Got here just before the rush hour at about 7 pm. Our food (main entrees) didn't get here till 9 pm. Service is slow and downright atrocious. Server was overwhelmed. Food was underwhelming. Got the udon carbonara. It was just chewy gravy mess. 

This isn't a fusion restaurant like Carino. Basically, they have a Japanese menu and an Italian menu. Very few actual fusion dishes. 

I think people come here because all other places are too busy. I anticipate this place will be out of business in a year."}
{"text":"Went with a couple other people. We started with Edamame beans, which were good. Myself and my Hubby ordered Italian - spaghetti with meatballs and Caesar salad. The spaghetti itself was fine, however the meatballs were not seasoned well and a little over done. My salad had a bit too much dressing and was actually quite salty - mediocre at best. My friend ordered the California roll, and had good things to say, other than it didn't hold together very well (she had to shove the whole piece in her mouth). The waiter/service was okay - he was dressed in a sports shirt, and slightly abrasive - but he made a sangria for my friend which was not on the menu. 
I'm also not a huge fan of it being a \"fusion\" restaurant, and a bar, and a club? They were advertising a DJ for the evening. However, maybe other people enjoy that. 

Overall, experience and food was meh - probably won't return."}
{"text":"I ended up at MiraKuru on a whim one night as I was walking by looking for a place to eat on 17th avenue. We took a little time to think over our food orders and ordered drinks in the meantime. The drinks were overly sweet & not particularly memorable. We then ordered a few appetizers in place of an entree as we wanted to sample a few things. Then, we waited. Our server didn't come over to ask if we wanted more drinks or to explain any kind of delay on our food. The restaurant had a larger party and a few other tables but nothing a professional restaurant of that size shouldn't be able to handle. The waitresses leaned up against the bar facing the bar when they weren't busy and made no effort to interact with us. Finely, after waiting more than 45 minutes for miso soup, some sort of chicken appetizer and tempura, we decided it wasn't worth a minute more waiting. I walked up to a different waitress as mine was still MIA and let her know we wanted our bill. She was able to magically conjur up our chicken from the kitchen with in seconds but we already had our coats on and were out the door. MiraKura = waitresses with very poor customer service skills, and glacially slow service. I can't tell you if the food is any good, but I can tell you I'm never going back."}
{"text":"Have to say this place is pretty dynamic.  Italian/Sushi/Lounge/Restaurant/Bar/Patio, take your pick!  Regarding the food, I've tried much of the menu, and haven't been disappointed yet.  There is a lot of choice, and the service was always very reasonable.  I recommend the Five Alarm Roll (love Jalapeños and Sushi), the Teriyaki Glazed Salmon with Kimchi Rice and Soy Bok Choy (Kimchi may not be Japanese, but damn it's good), and the crab croquette, LOVE THIS PLACE.  

Come to think of it, I haven't tried their desserts ..... but after following them on Instagram, I have another reason to go back and try something new!"}
{"text":"First Time here- had a nice patio atmosphere. Waiter was very helpful in helping us decide what to order/ we ended up getting the burger with onions and mushrooms-which was pretty good. Will be back to try other stuff"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend to try both: italian and japanese food. We ordered the italian pizza, which personally I loved it, and the dynamite roll, with prawn and wasabi mayo. The food was very good! The service excellent! I definitely come back!"}
{"text":"MiraKuRu, which means Miracle, is exactly what the food turned out to be, A Japanese/Italian restaurant, what a mix, I have been waiting for this place to open, with the Master Chef, SEKIHATA  KATSUYUKI and his experience from different parts of the world, working in some of the finest restaurants. He brings new flavors, fresh ingredients, and an amazing presentation. So after I saw that they had a soft opening, I took my family for dinner on a Sunday night. We were greeted and seated in the booth facing the front of the restaurant and also 17th Ave. I ordered miso soup, and soy ginger marinated chicken for appetizers, then came the mains: MiraKuru Roll, with Prawns,avocado,mango, tuna, cucumber, salmon, himachi, scallop. It's definitely the \"Feature Roll\". I also had the Dynamite Roll w/ prawn tempura, wasabi mayo, and citrus teriyaki sauce. WoW! My kids tried the Teriyaki BBQ, and Chicken Nanban, both need serious explanations, but I won't because they need to be Tasted and Enjoyed! We ended the night with Italian, we had the Tiramisu which was lovely, home made with love! And to Top it all off, the value for portion was great, I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Interesting addition to the Calgary food scene. Menu is varied and lots of selection. Ordered a few different appies; would recommend the crab croquettes and mussels. Overall food was above average and service is great. Would be back!"}
{"text":"Being my third time here I expected decent food and service but it definitely wasn't. To start, the menu has significantly shrunk down in choices front Entrees from Japan. Also, previously my fav roll was dynamite but the rice was very mushy. Service wasn't terrible but could've been much better as the server didn't seem to care much about us  

DONT SIGN UP FOR THE SKIPTHELINE APP PROMO. it was advertised as if you sign up with their code you would get $10 off your bill. However it wasn't your current bill; it had to be food ordered through the app. 

Overall, bye bye Mirakuru. NOT coming back for sure."}
