{"text":"Went in to order a pizza the last week before they closed for winter.  Owner was eating in dining room with staff and was incredibly friendly.  Pizza was fantastic!  Important: Cash only.

Located right in North Park, next to bike shop and across from batting cages"}
{"text":"We love this place. Very casual and very fresh ingredients. I have traveled to over 150 countries and have had pizza in every country that served it. The pizza from Tomato Pie is my favorite Pizza on this globe"}
{"text":"Tomato Pie is an incredible locally owned restaurant....they grow their vegetables and herbs behind the restaurant....literally. We watched them pick our basil and Swiss chard for our order. Had the grilled cauliflower with kale and quinoa, and the greens and beans. All so unbelievably fresh, beautiful flavor combinations.....simple yet perfect. Also had pizza, which is great as well....next time I will order something more complex from their small but interesting menu. If you can make cauliflower and kale taste magnificent.....what else can you do? Go to Tomato Pie.....foodies won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner last night after a bike ride between 7:30 and 8 and were informed that they were out of Pizza and Chicken.  We are not very picky and our main draw there was the Kale and Cauliflower dish, so we stayed.  That being said...how do you run of of your main draw pizza and chicken?  My guess is that people are coming over to Tomato Pie after being informed that OTB across the lake has a 1.5 hour wait and the owners of TP have not adjusted to the increased business.  

Like many others on this list, I agree that the food is pretty good, but the service is spotty and environment is a little run down.  The servers are mostly attentive but clearly stretched with tables and not well trained.  The front patio is charming but if you have to sit in the dinning room or back patio, you definitely feel like you are in a dive.  This adds some charm to the patio but little charm to the dinning and back patio.  With some TLC this place could be great.  We regularly use the park and would frequent more often however, the inconsistency limits our visits. 

I want this place to win. It is in a great location and is the perfect menu for a quick stop after a bike or run. It has so much potential, you just don't know what you will get visit to visit."}
{"text":"I love the pizzas here! Fresh ingredients, happy waitresses, and a relaxed atmosphere... This is one of my favorite summer spots. Seat yourself outside and bring your own wine!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service is sucks. They don't take cards for payment. It is BYOB though so that's cool. Get the pizza!"}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant to go to during the summer months! It's BYOB which is pretty cool. The food is good and the atmosphere is nice because it's in the park."}
{"text":"We've been patrons for years. And were pleasantly, absolutely surprised with the new menu! Rico uses the freshest grown herbs from his garden and prepares dishes to order. Still BYOB too. Enjoy and \"mangia\" \"mangia\"! Caveat: Visit before he closes for the season."}
{"text":"Tomato Pie was recommended to me by a patient - he raved about the pizza! Raved enough that I quickly added it to my restaurant list of places to try. Due to only being open for the summer season, I was only able to try it now. And it did not disappoint! 

I arrived and had to wait in line for patio seating as the night was absolutely exquisite. Plants and umbrellas enclose the patio area, making it feel cozy and private. Our waitress was quick to serve us our drinks and take our orders. The prices appear to be on the higher side based on the appearance of the restaurant; however after watching other guests receive their meals, the portion sizes are very generous and could easily be split between two individuals. My friend and I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza to share and we did not leave a crumb behind! The two of us ate the entire thing - the cheese was so melty, the pepperoni small and greasy, and the sauce so fresh and flavorful! And the crust? Just perfect! Thin, with a light crisp along the edge. Needless to say, we were delighted with our choice and I would love to go back and try out some of the salad options that they have to offer. 

Things to keep in mind: cash only, BYOB, and the parking lot is very small - so be prepared to wait for spot if the restaurant is as busy as it was tonight, or park in the overflow by the bike rental. I highly recommend checking this locally own pizza joint out!"}
{"text":"Slow as molasses service, the servers do not help each other out at all, even walking by your EMPTY glass of water as they refill their customers glasses 4 feet away.  Menu is extremely limited.  Parking is very hard to come by.  Bring your own dressing when you go here because they only have vinaigrette, no kidding, nothing else.  Hello but how hard it is to buy a few other types when you order from your distributor."}
{"text":"Came for lunch. I loved the atmosphere.  We chose the back patio and had a nice view of the garden where a portion of the vegetables an herbs are grown. Just beat the lunch rush and glad we did. They filled up fast. I will return to try the penne with leek next time."}
{"text":"Great pizzas! Steak sandwich kind of fatty.  Flat bread awesome.  No credit cards which stinks because then this is not a place you can drop in on, you have to plan for so you have cash on you.  Owner grows own herbs out back so it's always very fresh!  Kinda dumpy but the owner must like it that way or he would change."}
{"text":"The food here tastes incredibly fresh!  I think this is because they gorw fresh ingredients in the garden.  You can sit inside, inside a covered porch, and outside.  We love to stop by here while enjoying North Park.  The staff is always nice and very quick.  

Place is BYOB, which is a +."}
{"text":"Great BYOB spot right in North Park. A medium pizza is the perfect size to split between two people."}
{"text":"Great little spot for Italian food. Byob. No reservations or call ahead and the hours are hard to remember. But when you get a table, it's worth it. Especially outside in the summer. Great pizza and pasta. They do take out too.

Check it out, it's well worth it."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY - which is kind of annoying in many ways.  

I love their bruschetta - though it's a bit pricey for a tiny portion.  I always go with their classic margarita pizza with extra cheese and I bring it home and just add extra basil from my garden.  You can tell the freshness of the ingredients they use.

I don't really like to eat there.. it's kind of a hole in a wall joint and it's stuffy to eat inside the place."}
{"text":"There are so many great places to eat around here, why would you choose one which only takes cash, on a busy corner, with incredibly slow service? 

Cash only? In this century? Seriously? Even in Africa I can usually pay for dinner using a credit card. 

The two staffers working here seemed to be very dedicated, especially the young woman, but the business is clearly understaffed. There's even a large sign outside saying that they need staff, so this must be a permanent situation for them. Why not just pay the staff a little more, be nice to them, and don't have the turnover? Your customers will probably enjoy your product faster and, unlike me, look forward to coming back. 

The pizza, by the way, isn't too bad."}
{"text":"This is a unique, cozy Italian place to grab lunch or dinner.  You can bring your own wine or beer.  The outside eating area is surrounded by carefully tended flowers, herbs, and a dwarf fruit tree barrier shaped into a divider to hide the neighboring business.  We have gone here for many years and usually get the pizza made with fresh tomatoes and lots of fresh basil.  The cook uses herbs and vegetables from a garden growing out back.  We have always had good service.  If you go during traditional lunch and dinner hours, expect a wait because this secret has not been well kept!

Don't visit this restaurant if you're expecting the efficiency of a chain restaurant.  You will see customers chatting and laughing over a glass of wine - not checking their phones. Everything here is homemade and worth the wait.  Enjoy the experience and the outdoors!"}
{"text":"This is the real thing-- friendly, welcoming people with genuine roots in Italy and a life remade in America in one generation . The menu is easy to look over quickly but read the description of each dish: this is a kitchen that cares about the quality of every single ingredient . Italian classics like penne primavera but also dishes with a more middle eastern accent: dates with ch√®vre and mint. Even the beet salad has toasted cashews sprouted watermelon seeds and fresh blueberries. Thank goodness for places like these for people who don't consider chain restaurants an option. Perfect ten."}
{"text":"I love this little dive.  Yes it is a dive.  Disjointed and small, but that is what makes it charming.  Cash only, but lick the plate tomato basil sauce, I can't get enough if it, and the crusty rolls are always served hot!  The menu is not very extensive, but everything is fresh.  There is an area outside to eat, in the back in a breezeway, and inside. The owner Rico is a cool guy.  Only reason not 5 star is that it is cash only, and not open all year."}
{"text":"Tomato Pie is a busy little restaurant just outside of north park in McCandless Township. This place has me constantly scratching my head as the food is quite good. The fresh ingredients (I think they may grow some of their produce) make for a wonderfully delicious pizza. The outdoor seating and BYOB makes for a great spot for a summertime meal.  

My criticisms are that the hours are not very good, I think they close at 8PM, the parking is difficult, the building needs improvement, and I've never had what I would consider good service.   

I live less than a mile away from Tomato Pie and would like to make this place a regular spot for a casual meal.  Unfortunately I can't rely on this restaurant as a comfortable go-to.

I recommend simply picking up their Depositano pie and either eating at home or at a nearby shelter in the park."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and have been a loyal customer for years. All the herbs for the food are grown here, and you can find them among the flower beds and barrels surrounding the patio. 

The ambiance is adorable and quaint, which makes me love \"TPC\" even more. It helps that I've met the owner a couple of times and he seemed like a genuinely nice person. I am all about giving my money to nice people with solid businesses. Most importantly here, everything tastes REAL and FRESH. 

You can't go wrong with one of their specialty pies and a custom topping or two of your own. I've recommended this place many times and will do so again. Looking forward to my next visit. Yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took our dogs to north park to enjoy the evening. We decided to get dinner as well and found found this place nearby. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza for take out and good thing my wife had cash since this place is cash only. When I arrived for pick up it was fairly crowded and had some nice outdoor seating to enjoy the weather. 

The pizza itself was ok. The pepperoni was a little tastier than most and had a good portion of cheese. I thought the sauce was a little lacking and light but other than that it was a very good meal to eat outside at north park. 

I would definitely come here again if I'm at north park and looking for pizza and have cash! The pizza was solid and the outdoor seating makes this an attractive place to come to."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!

Eh I went there with my gf on a double date because she had heard good things about it from other people. We sat on the back patio which was kinda dumpy. Actually, the entire place is kinda dumpy except for the front patio. The place is usually packed when I pass by so its beyond me why they don't spend a little money on the place. 3 of us ordered waters and the fourth orders a pop which was given to her in can form. The waters were taken from a Gatorade type cooler that you see at most sports events... 

So to begin with, I am displeased with the lack of infrastructure or sheer quality of the building. Maybe its because I am a tech junkie and wish everything was top of the line, but still, don't give me water out of a cooler.

The only saving grace of this place was the pizza. We ordered a regular with pepperoni and the other was a tomato pie. Both were very good, except the tomato pie pizza had a very thin crust that could have used a little fluffing.

Overall, the building/utilities suck, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Extremely slow, poor service all the way around. Disorganized staff. We waited over an hour for our food, which came out at different times and was so far spread out that none of us ate at the same time. When we asked to speak with the owner it took him over ten minutes to appear and he was extremely nonchalant about our entire experience. Needless to say, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Great local homegrown Italian spot! They grow most of their own produce right on the property. Everything feels homemade and authentic here. It's really nice to sit outside on the flower covered patio ?"}
{"text":"Slow service, good food, decent spot.

Living in the North Hills we try desperately to find places near us instead of just going into the city to eat out.  Tomato Pie Cafe looked like a cozy little place and has some decent reviews.  Apparently they also grow a good amount of their herbs and vegetables.  A plus, but not exactly feasible when visiting in late April.   

The place is small and because of this you'd expect good service.  Not true, slow, almost painfully slow was our experience.  

Onto the food.  We got a feta, spinach, tomato pie.  The crust was good, not wood fired or great, but good.  The sauce tasted fresh and wasn't overdone.  The toppings were fresh, but not garden fresh as advertised.  The feta was decent.  

Bottom line:  I could make this pizza at home on the grill better and not have to put up with the painfully slow service."}
{"text":"My parents were in from Florida because of Irma and they wanted to go to Tomato Pie. We were lucky to secure a table but that was also when our luck ran out. We ordered 3 soft drinks and were told they don't have any soft drinks anymore. Our choices were plain water or canned San Pellegrino water. So we asked for 3 waters. The waitress asked if we wanted lemon and we answered yes and ice too please. She responded they didn't have any ice. Seriously.. no ice. They weren't out of ice. They just don't have ice for customers. By now we were shaking our heads. We received our salads and asked for our rolls. The waitress brought them and when she placed them on the table she said they had no butter either. NO soft drinks. NO ice. NO butter. No thank you. We won't be back. SMH."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend after we walked around north park. We split a pizza and a salad.  Everything tasted homemade, home grown and fresh.  This place is worth the stop. 

Just remember to bring cash.  It's a cash only establishment.   It wasn't too pricey.  We ate for $30 and that includes the tip. 

It's a small place, servers are friendly.  It's definitely a take your time, enjoy the meal, and don't come if you're in a rush type of establishment.  I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an institution for the locals of the North Hills and I always intend to visit, but rarely follow through.  I first visited close to a decade ago and remember having a truly sublime linguine with this pink leek sauce and intended to see how it stacked up a decade later.  I got the chance to re-visit this last week on a gorgeous weekday late afternoon and it was packed.  Now, let me preface this review by saying I had extremely high expectations as I have found that whenever the \"tomatoe pie cafe\" comes up in casual conversation it is typically accompanied with plenty of \"oohs and ahhs\".  So, I'll ask you in advance for your patience if parts of this review seem overly critical.  I entered the main building area which quite frankly seems a bit dungeon like (definitely sit outside or in the screened area in the back) with the low ceilings and dark lighting.  I wasn't quite sure the protocol, so I was looking for help from the server who I made eye contact with darting around... After a few minutes another customer who must have noticed my \"doe in the headlights\" look was nice enough to tell me its seat yourself, so I did find a table, but without chairs.  So, I wandered around for a bit asking diners if they had any extra seats until I found two for myself and my girlfriend.  Annie was outside on the phone and thankfully was spared this ackward start.  I sat down.  She came in and had a seat we waited...and waited...The same server who had certainly noticed my bumbling still did not come over.  Annie starting to notice the steam coming out of my ears and was quick enough to ask another server (a lovely young gal) if we could sit outside and if she would clear a table and minutes later we were on the back deck enjoying the sunlight and while only steps away from the dungeon and poor service felt worlds away from the initial experience.  The waitress brings us a corkscrew for the bottle of wine and gives us a menu.  The menu is relatively small, which is fine for a spot like this.  They focus primarily on a few pasta dishes, a couple appetizers, maybe a sandwich or two and their pizza.  Incidentally, if you are a fan of Rico's in the NH this is owned by him or one of his sons.  I've always found this restaurant family very gracious and definitely ingredient driven.  We decide to order the garlic bread and tomato/mozzarella salad as appetizers.  The appetizers arrive relatively quickly and I'm very pleased with the garlic bread.  It's warm and \"garlicky\" with a light sprinkling of parmasen cheese served on great quality multigrain or wheat bread.  The tomatoe/mozz. salad was a bit of a miss for me.  I don't eat lettuce, so this is my standard type of salad and while it is a simple dish, it can be really good or really meh', sadly this was the latter.  The tomatoe had really no flavor.  I know the owner has a garden and probably grew this himself, but perhaps it wasn't quite ripe or something, but I wasn't pleased with the quality.  I also didn't like the fact that it was not sliced,but instead quartered.  This doesn't seem to make sense in serving with sliced mozzarella.  The mozzarrella itself was pretty good quality and served correctly at room temperature and a pretty healthy portion.  The dish itself wasn't seasoned at all as far as I could tell and probably would have benefited from a little olive oil and balsamic.  As a note of contrast Friday I was at dinner with clients at the Carlton and order the same dish and it was served with perfectly ripe tomatoes, good quality cheese, some basil a splash of olive oil and aged balsamic.  It was also seasoned with this great hawaiian rock salt (granted it was more than double the cost of Tomatoe Pie).  Annie ordered a pepperoni pizza.  It was good.  About medium crust, plenty of cheese good quality pepperoni.  It was perfectly acceptable, but nothing that would warrant a special trip.  Now, the penne with leek sauce this dish would warrant a drive to North Park.  This is their signature dish and I can see why.  The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente' and the leek sauce is bursting with flavor while stil being light and delicate.  It's a cream based sauce that is sprinkled with sun dried tomatoes and obviously a generous portion of leeks.  Given the current economy I certainly appreciate good value and I do have to say that this was a pretty good meal and a good bargain at $27.90 (not including tip) for the whole meal.  I mean the penne and leeks were only $9.  I usually end up paying more than that at Panera.  I also really like the BYOB.  I will be back again and certainly look for the blonde friendly waitress, sit outside and stick to their signature items."}
{"text":"If you like tomatoes then this is the place to go. The tomato pie is great. This place is BYOB which is nice. They close at 9pm in the summer and have weird hours during the week. I think they are closed Sunday's and Monday's. The nice thing is if you eat in the evening and have your own alcohol you can stay and drink after they close. The staff just leaves. So it's nice if you are hanging out with your friends. This place is only accepts cash so hit the ATM beforehand. The closest is PNC about 2 miles away by Giant Eagle."}
