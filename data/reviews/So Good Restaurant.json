{"text":"This place is fantastic. Being from Hong Kong, So Good makes me extremely nostalgic of my home city as it has insanely good food and drinks for very reasonable prices. 

For instance: you can get the classic beef stir-fry with thick rice noodles + iced milk tea + Chinese-style soup for $7. 

The portions are generous and high quality, plus that Chinese-style soup is exactly how my parents make it at home! 

Plus: they have many different menus for you to choose from, such as \"All Day Breakfast\" or \"Afternoon Tea\" which special prices. You can't beat this place!"}
{"text":"So good is a hk style restaurant, their food are just like the ones in hk and delicious. The services are pretty good and fast, food are pretty cheap in general. I recommend to come here for dinner since their dinner dishes are more tasty. But I really don't like how untidy and dirty this place is, especially the fish tank at the door."}
{"text":"I came here for early dinner since I have a class in the evening.  The decor was kind of a old fashion Chinese HK afternoon tea type with uncomfortable booth chair with vinyl.  The price is quite reasonable though.  I got my bbq pork and bak choy with rice noodle for $5.50 plus tax (afternoon tea set was still available).  There is also an accompanying beverage.  The service was quick, but she was quite stone face, maybe she had a long day.  I waited for 10 minutes for the food after ordering which was quite reasonable.  I would come back since the food does not seem to contain msg.  I would usually have a slight thirst after msg food, but I felt fine after eating here.  Not bad overall."}
{"text":"If you want cheap, decent not overly oily/salted Hong Kong style food, here is the place for you."}
{"text":"This time was definitely WAY better than my last review.

Food is still good. But service and drinks have finally worked themselves out. 

Looks like they finally got another helping hand. They used to only have two ladies, now it's three. 

Drinks arrived before the food, and everything was in a timely manner. 

(Also, check out the cherry blossom tree in that parking lot!!)"}
{"text":"default restaurant for my family and myself. we come here every weekend, and sometimes for dinner during the week as well. very good prices, and the food is really similar to the way it's prepared and cooked in hong kong. the lunch sets include the usual buttered toast, fried eggs, noodles in soup and a drink. really simple but delicious. i've also tried their baked spaghetti with black pepper sauce and chicken cutlet, which i think has a great portion size, and is very good for it's price. they also allow free changes to sauces, which i personally really like. recommended!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was here, but they have some super dedicated patrons. My aunt's friend comes almost every day for dinner. To be honest, I'm skeptical when people I don't know make food recommendations for me, but this one turned out surprisingly well.

Allison Y was right when she said that the ambiance of this place is as Hong Kong cafe as it gets. It's literally like being transported back to Hong Kong. I loved it. It's a no-frills kinda place. Your hot tea gets served in a plastic cup. They've got the Chinese stirfry dinner dishes, as well as some standouts like lamb and bean curd sheet hot pot (seasonal), water spinach with preserved bean curd and pepper threads, and an assortment of sizzling pots. They've also got all the classic Hong Kong cafe dishes.

For $7.50, I got a baked pork chop in tomato sauce on fried rice and it was one of the best I've had in a while. No cheese, but definitely baked, seeing the char on top. There was like two good-sized pork chop's worth of meat on my rice. They were also surprisingly juicy. The tomato sauce was standard, which is great in my opinion. I like my tomato sauce the Chinese way. Sweet, almost ketchupy, and not too much like real tomatoes. That's my comfort food right there. The fried rice base wasn't super eggy, but enough that I really can't complain. All in all, a super satisfying dish at a fantastic price.

I also tried their pineapple bun with butter. We're talking almost a centimeter's worth of butter in the middle of a hot pineapple bun. The top of that bun was nice and sweet and crumbly, and surprisingly, it didn't feel like I was biting into a huge chunk of butter. It wasn't super sweet, but it was a nice way to end my meal.

I have a feeling this is going to be one of those places that Grandpa doesn't like (not fancy enough for him even though the food is good), but one of the places that I love (because I'm a sucker for cheap, good food.)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and the food was yummy. This is a typical traditional hong kong style resturant with baked rice and stir fry dishes. Their portions and prices are good. We ordered the black pepper sauce with ox tongue with rice and it was yummy. Their sauce is similar to the black pepper sauce in hong kong. I also got the fresh beef sandwich with the bread toasted and it was also really yummy. The sandwich was $3.75 and it included a drink. The rice was $7.99 and it also included a drink and soup. The food came out hot and fresh. I believe their lunch menu changes every other week so they might not have the same lunch items next week."}
{"text":"Like many fellow Yelpers have said, this place gives you that home style kind of feeling. Although it's not the cleanest, and lacks in decor, their food is decent. I've never had a time where I found their dishes to be too salty, so I guess that's a good sign. They offer HK style favourites such as milk tea, baked rice, fried noodles with beef. Their service can be a hit or a miss, especially when it gets a tad busier. Overall, it's worth a try if you're looking for a decent HK Style meal in the area."}
{"text":"The food itself was good but the cleanliness could be better.  They have a stench of cooking grease and the floor looked greasy.  For the food price point I am not to complain much.  I had the udon with Satay beef and eggs to go with it. Simple comfort hk food."}
{"text":"I like this place, mostly for nostalgia and comfort food purposes. It's like it's been transported from Hong Kong somewhere and placed in a unassuming brown strip mall in Richmond Hill. Don't expect fancy furnishings, but everything is serviceable and the waiter is quick. There is even the ever-present TV playing whatever is interesting in the media lately. 

 The food is surprisingly good, with solid dinner dishes like the sweet and sour pork, half chicken and veggies. The set meals are pretty much like ordering the individual dishes on their own but it comes with soup and rice. Good proportions for the price and perfect for when you just need a home-cooked style meal. An added bonus is that none of the food is overly greasy, salty, MSGed or swimming in sauces."}
{"text":"The ambiance is the first thing I notice.  This is, hands down, as Hong Kong cafe as it gets.  I felt like I stood right in a little neighborhood cafe in a villa in Kowloon somewhere.  I asked my brother if it looked like the \"Nice and Cheap\" caf√© (???) in our old neighborhood, and he nodded.  For those who are not used a HK dive, please be forewarned that you will probably be taken back by it.  The furniture can really be better.  I suspect someone have imported the 2 big, round tables from Asia to here, as I can't imagine any manufacturer in N and S America will make these, or this style of table as a matter of fact.

It was late afternoon, so we ordered a bunch of stuff from the afternoon tea (???) menu.  The stir fried noodle had \"wok air\", and resembled the right color of an authentic one in Hong Kong.  My mom complained not having enough beef.  Her dish not mine, so I took her words. The few chicken/beef/fish fillet on rice/spaghetti orders were reasonably portioned, with adequate amount of meat and vegetables. (The meat and vegetables were lumped on the side, so I could see others portion easily).  Everything tasted reasonable.

Services was fast and to the point.  I wouldn't say it was warm and friendly, though.  This kind of sucks the charm out of the place.  Aren't villa neighborhood joints supposed to be friendly?  

Do I like this place?  For late afternoon tea, the food vs value is a bit off.  But my brother referred this place to me.  He said the dinner food was good.  I think I will return to try the dinner."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is easy to miss if you're not looking and the inside isn't very nice to look at but the food is good and the prices are great for what you get. 

I've only came here a couple times with my mom and grandma but both times have been good. Tried their steamed chicken, ground pork with green beans, baked pork chop with rice and baked fish with rice. The portions are good and their afternoon tea is a good deal (soup, main, and tea). 

If you're in the mood for some cheap good Chinese food then you should def try this place."}
{"text":"So good eh? It's not that noticeable of a restaurant, but my dad caught a glimpse of it when we drove down Leslie one day. The only reason we considered stopping here is cause of the \"So\", that being my last name. No, seriously.

The decorations of this restaurant is practically at zero. It's about as bland as a new house with no paint, and it's also quite a narrow restaurant compared to other HK style cafes I've been to. I won't judge in terms of decorations as I rather have good food and bad decorations than good decorations and bad food. Unfortunately, the food didn't fair any better.

The satay beef noodles was not very good. The noodle (ho fan) was way too thick and poor quality, and the strangest thing was we were never given a spoon for the soup base or to hold the noodles together, cause many simply fell apart. In fact I was so pissed off to the point I only ate half the dish even though I wasn't even full.

Service was also not the best, simply due to a lack of service. We had to seat ourselves, and the only time I saw waitresses was when we ordered, when they delivered the food/drinks, and giving us the bill. We tried to ask for a spoon, but nobody came to serve us after we got our food.

Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Not much to say actually. It's a standard HK diner, a bit run-down in terms of d√©cor compared to other places. As the other Yelper said, it is a very family vibe... reminds me of the typical family HK diners in the streets of HK. It's near Leslie and Highway 7, but situated in a more office/industrial like plaza where there's not much other food places (compared to a bit further down the road with Times Square etc). Despite it being Saturday around noon, this place was still quite full surprisingly - maybe regulars?

Menu offerings are what is expected of HK diners. Portions are good, and food quality is not bad (but I wouldn't say it's 'so good'). The HK milk tea deserves a thumbs up though!"}
{"text":"I'm sick of having too much MSG in other restaurants. I feeling like eating homemade dishes here."}
{"text":"So Good Restaurant is open for breakfast lunch and dinner.  But I've only gone for breakfast/brunch.  Prices are low, so don't expect super high calibre dining, but it's decent cooked food.  One thing that diners may have to get over is the appearance of the place.  I've seen Yelp reviews say that the restaurant is not clean.  Thats not true.  The place is a bit older but it's not dirty.  I've eaten in restaurants that have stickier table tops in Toronto.

As we typically go for breakfast/brunch, we tend to order off of their all day menu.  It usually consists of eggs and toast, noodle soup with some protein, and coffee/tea for around $6.  The day that I took the pictures, I ordered pork & preserved veggies with vermicelli with scrambled eggs & toast.  The hubby ordered chicken wings & instant noodles with fried eggs & toast.  Friends ordered luncheon meat on instant noodles with fried eggs & toast, and beef brisket on rice noodle.  Portions were decent sized, and taste is what you typically expect at a Hong Kong style cafe.  Usually when you order instant noodles, the prices of the dishes are higher, but it was quite low here.  The milk tae is pretty decent as well  And service was friendly.  A rare find at a Chinese restaurant.  Since then I have frequented So Good Restaurant quite a few times.  I thought I'd share this place with my parents.  Turns out they've been coming for years!"}
{"text":"So Good Restaurant definitely has a family vibe.

I still remember the days when I used to hang around my mother's store after school and do my homework and wait for her to get off. Here a handful of kids hanging around, watching cartoon on their laptops and playing games.

Deco here is simple, service is fast and friendly.

Afternoon Tea Specials from 2:00 pm to 5:30 pm priced from $2.75 and up

Beef Brisket with Noodle and Drink ($4.75) is a all day special so great if you want to have a cheap/light lunch.

Nothing fancy as So Good but is just Good enough for a fast meal!"}
{"text":"A simple Hong Kong restaurant. The price was very reasonable and the milk tea was great. Lunch combo can be 10 dollars include everything, soup/drink/tax"}
{"text":"Kinda looks sketchy but its actually pretty good for its price. I would say it's slightly better than other nearby Hong Kong style restaurants while be slightly cheaper.  Just like other reviewers has mentioned, it's been here for years but it seems to just skip under everyone's radar. Maybe it's due its location? 

Will I come back? Definitely yes; but would it replace my other go to Hong Kong cafes? Probably not."}
{"text":"Not bad. Service was not that great. We sat down as a group of 5. When the soup came, there were no bowls or utensils so we had to ask. The waitress came and only gave us 3 sets of bowls and spoons.. Once again there were 5 of us.

As we were eating we noticed we never got water either, so we asked for 5. Once again, she gave us 3.. So we asked for another 2 and she forgot. The set drinks also never came till the end which was quite weird because we wouldve liked it or expected it to come during the meal.

Overall 3/5. Food was good and not salty, but service was lacking."}
