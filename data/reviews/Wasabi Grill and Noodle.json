{"text":"Had a chicken and shrimp combo. Rarely do I not finish my meal... This was so bad it went straight to trash. You're much better off with other places in the same food court."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for lunch as it doesn't appear they have any vegetarian options, however I came by at breakfast to grab an egg'n'cheese toasted sandwich. It's super quick and it's only $2. I love that you can watch them fry the egg on the teppanyaki grill, and it's the only place around the area that I know of that doesn't microwave their eggs. Yay!

I always think it's weird to see Asian restaurants serving western foods, but they do have an egg and bacon noodle soup!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a breakfast sandwich and there were a couple of orders ahead of us. It took 20 minutes to get my order. I expect faster service than this in a food court. The sandwich itself was quite tasty."}
