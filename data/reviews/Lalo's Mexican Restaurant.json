{"text":"This is easily my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison, WI. I have been eating here once or twice per week since they opened and have not come anywhere near getting tired of the amazing food. This family owned spot goes above and beyond to deliver not only food that will leave you wishing you had bigger stomach, but an overall warm and pleasant dining experience. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would :) 

Tonight I got one of my personal favorite dishes, the tilapia dinner. Tilapia, grilled onions, and green peppers smothered in cheese, served with rice, beans, and six (6) fresh, hot tortillas (corn or flour-your choice). Every bite was an explosion of savory flavors. This is no small meal, but despite being full, the last bite was bittersweet knowing there was no more to enjoy.


Do yourself a favor and visit Lalo's as soon as you can. 


Oh by the way, every Tuesday is Taco Tuesdays with $1.50 tacos!!"}
{"text":"Ate here today and was impressed with the food, which was fresh and delicious and authentic. One of the best Mexican restaurants I have tried in the Madison area. I had a taco with pork al pastor, a tamale that had a green sauce on it, and rice and beans. All was very good."}
{"text":"Tacos are quick, fresh and always perfect. Everything on the menu has been delicious. So happy this restaurant came to the neighborhood, owners and staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Wow! Great addition to the Madison Mexican food scene. 
Arrival was easy, parking was a little challenging since the lot is a little small. 
Chips and salsa were absolutely delicious. The salsas where both very fresh, spicy, and flavorful. Often I'm turned off by hot flavors because they just feel hot and burn, not so for the salsa!
The only real muss of the meal was the guacamole. Maybe needed to warm up a bit, a bit more onion, salt or cilantro. Whatever was missing made it a slight disappointment until we had the idea to add some of the salsa to the guac. This sacrilege paid off! 
I had the carne asada dinner and my husband had the verde burrito with asada. They were both large portions with lots of meat. The corn tortillas for mine were the best I've had since California food trucks. Yum! And lots of them, which was great. I did order a margarita, which was fine, less syrupy sweet than the mix you buy at the supermarket. 
Overall, a definite new favorite with great family service."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out last night. We both loved our food; he ordered the Milanesa, and I ordered the chimichanga. The staff was friendly, and one of the co-owners stopped by to ask how we liked out meals. He also showed us the additional space in back, which can be reserved for baby showers and the like. The decor is simple, but tasteful. We are very happy with everything and we are planning to return again!"}
{"text":"We decided to try it out since it's nearby and we love Mexican food. We will be back!! Super nice people and great food at reasonable prices. I had cheese enchiladas mole and my husband had tacos. Everything tasted authentic and even our margaritas were made with fresh lime juice! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to this side of town!  An authentic Mexican restaurant.  If you like Taqueria Guadalajara, you will enjoy this. We had the Flautas with rice and beans and the Lalo's special which was a plate filled with grilled steak, beans, rice, cactus, chorizo, grilled green onions, potatoes, salsa, and served with tortillas.  It was excellent!  We will be coming back again so we can try more from the menu!  This may become my favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"I want with 4 friends. We had fajitas, chimichangas, burritos, and Echilladas Verdes. Everything was tasty without being too hot, fresh, and well presented for a good price. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is again one of those times I wish I could give 3.5 stars. I hate to break the 3 review streak of 5 stars but I left disappointed. 

Lalo's is an authentic mexican restaurant conveniently located on the west side of Madison. There is a fun story that was in the news paper about this place and it set the expectations high.  I was really thrilled to try this place given the limited availability of real Mexican food on the west side.

We liked the decor, compliments to the owner for all of his hard work as he did all the remodeling himself.

When seated we were provided with chips and salsa. Both salsas were spicy. We werent given water 10 minutes until after the chips and salsa and there was nothing to clear the hot mouth. Wait staff were no where to be seen.

We ordered flautas and a chimichanga. There was an issue with ordering in that there was a language barrier between us and the waitress. Our food allergies didnt seem to be well communicated. The food was above average and authentic. It is made fresh to order and meat is not prepared in advanced. Rice and beans were good as well.

We ordered flan for dessert and this didnt live up to expectations. It didnt have an appropriate consistency and did not have any of the classic sauce. 

I think the service needs to be worked on and there could be some improvements. I would still recommend it to a friend and will come back my self as I think the issues Ive stated are just growing pains of being a new restaurant. Hopefully I'll be able to change the review and a more enthusiastic yes."}
{"text":"Went to Lalo's for the first time today - it was great! Got the enchiladas verdes and was very impressed. I grew up in California and this place did not disappoint. The portions were perfect - not skimpy, but not overwhelming - and the flavors were \"authentic\" (to my American tastebuds!). My husband got the mole with veggies and he loved it too. Great for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went here for some takeout.  Waited forever for my order.  When I got home with my order, I learned that they totally screwed up 2 of the 3 entres  and didn't give me my appetizer.  Food was marginal at best.  0 stars more appropriate. The tostada had no cheese on it and broccoli and cauliflower who does that?! That is not Mexican at all. The portions were so small. I felt like I was eating air. Just horrible!"}
{"text":"This is a small, cute place to grab some decent Mexican food! I have chicken fajitas and they were just ok. No spices or marinade, just plain fajitas but they were tasty enough. I had a chicken gordita as well and that was DELISH. The shell tasted homemade and the caramelized onions were a nice touch. My partner got a steak chimichanga and that was good. The wrap was a little greasy, and chewy in some spots, but tasty enough. All in all, it was a good place but nothing special."}
{"text":"Not overly impressed. Service was just adequate. Margaritas were way too colorful -- looked like far too much artificial dye in the mixer and tasted just okay. Food was also okay but nothing too rave about. Better Mexican cuisine available elsewhere in madison."}
{"text":"New Mexican joint. Ran by to check it out...looks like they are still working on putting place together. But the food was DELICIOUS! Authentic Mexican food...staff was friendly. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here because the reviews on yelp were so good, and we were craving some authentic Hispanic food. Unfortunately, we were both disappointed with the quality. Beans tasted like they were straight from a can and the enchiladas were mediocre. Not much flavor. The margaritas tasted like they were tequila with generic margarita mix. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just for the tacos and spicy green salsa I want to give 5 stars. It was one of the best I have had in Madison. I am deducting a star for the rest of dishes we tried- Steak Sopas, Huevos Rancheros, chimichanga. The chimichanga was too oily. Our plate still had plenty of oil not strained. I have had better Rancheros. It lacked salsa on top. 

The green salsa was so good.. we had to buy a cup to take home. The service was very pleasant. It was a true family run restaurant. When ever I crave for tacos, I know have a new place to come to!!!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and love trying new restaurants and always stay away from chains as I like to support local owners. This place was cute, cheap and right across from campus so I'm sure they do a decent business.

I ordered the queso and surf n turf burrito (I think that's what it was called..?). The queso was...weird. It was a white cheese like I've had everywhere else, but it had a weird flavor. I couldn't quite figure out what it was. I still ate most of it but wouldn't get it again. The burrito was decent. It was big but not much surf or turf in it. The pieces of shrimp and steak that I did find were delightful, just wish there was a little more."}
{"text":"Granted it was busy just after 6:00 on a Thursday, I didnt think it was so vusy to warrant such a long wait, prob 20 minutes to get our food.when we did get it, half the meal was warm, the other cold. Good reviews so we went, I'm fiving them the benefit of doubt with a 3.

BTW..the staff was excellent, constantly stopping by to see if there was anything we needed while we waited for the food."}
{"text":"Ordered take out of 3 tacos on their $1.50 taco tuesday ended up getting charged $7 and change.  There was no salsa provided and one little wedge of lime in the box. The only redeeming quality was that the taco was warm. Very disappointing experience"}
{"text":"A fairly good, quick place. Restaurant is small but charming. The location is in a nice area that seemed to lack many other authentic restaurants. I very much enjoyed the enchiladas(verde sauce+cheese). Chips + Salsa were win and featured a hot and mild salsa. Prices were fair for portion sizes. No complaints."}
{"text":"It was good. I had a steak burrito and the portions are small compared to Laredo's and Aranda's Deforest.  The fajitas looked good though, maybe next time...."}
{"text":"I finally got to visit this new place and really liked it. The is  food spiced a little different than some of the other places and has some zip to it.  They have those silly but good, multi-colored chips and two sauces that come with the meals. The sauces are homemade and good as well. There is a full bar here so you can get a drink if you want but the food comes so fast than you wouldn't have time to drink a beer. I was here with a friend at lunch time and we were out of there in about 30 minutes. Not rushed, it's just that the food comes fast. Wait staff was efficient but not overly friendly as tends to be the case with places like this. Maybe a language issue, who knows . It doesn't make any difference we got what we ordered and loved the food."}
{"text":"I hate giving mediocre ratings to mom and pop type restaurants but this one does not impress. We went for lunch and spend $24 with tip for two plates and one soda. The complimentary chips were like something your can buy at any grocery store and the dips were same older stuff. The beans and rice sides were good, the beans had a buttery flavor. The iceberg shredded lettuce was non nutritional and bland. The tamales were good, the flautas smaller than I am accoustomed to. All in all a c experience. I had heard good things so we were disappointed."}
{"text":"We got their enchiladas verdes with chicken and chimichangas with a side of chips and guac for take-out. Given the lack of good Mexican food joints in the greater Madison area, it felt pretty good to come across this gem that recently opened up.

Both entrees were absolutely on point in flavor and tremendously filling for a good price point. The guacamole was spicy and delicious, and the portion size was super generous. Don't be afraid to load up the guac on each chip!

Very good first impression so far. Willing to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Perfectly adequate mexican food, perfectly adequate service.  My mole fanatic friend gives the mole 3/5."}
{"text":"I like this place! It's not fancy but the food is very good. Service was good, margarita's good, and the salsa was so good, a member of my group got some to go! 

We met one of the owner's, Oscar - very friendly and helpful. He was helping to wait tables and filling in where needed. We ordered 2 different fajitas and got so much we took it home and ate it for lunch. I don't normally care for Flan but we gave it a try and I thought it was great. Not like I'd had in other places. 

I crave food from here about every 10 days and will keep coming back. I haven't tried the food to go but will in the future."}
{"text":"I'll start with the positive. Chips and salsa super good! Nice menu. Service was fast the staff seemed friendly. The rest of my experience just so so I want to like it but I wasn't impressed. Basic layout and feel of the place not my favorite. Especially compared to other Mexican restaurants on the west side. I got pork pastor taco, beef gordita and rice and beans with a margarita to drink. Large margarita is good large size but I needed more ice. The taco was ok. The gordita was so disappointing. The beef was good. But the shell not good to me and no lettuce or tomato or anything just beef cheese and a not so great shell. May have been some beans in there. Rice and beans were enjoyable. My friend got the enchiladas suizas she said they were ok. Maybe other things on the menu taste better the other reviews seem really positive but this  wouldn't be my first choice for Mexican."}
{"text":"Came here for a late afternoon lunch and left a fan.  The menu lists the typical Mexican offerings (enchildas, tortas, burritos, tacos, etc) and I opted for the 3 taco dinner plate (complete with rice and refried beans).  Each table also receives complementary chips and two different salsas (red-mild and green-spicy).  Both were excellent.  For my protein, I selected tongue, steak and pastor.  The tacos come taqueria style with cilantro and onion and were all delicious.  The tongue was tender but still had a good bite to it while the pastor was flavorful from the marinade it was in.  Service was friendly and quick.
The inside isn't much to look at but if they continue to churn out quality food, I will be definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Tacos, tacos, tacos!  Best pastor in Madison hands down. Get the pastor and you will be happy!"}
{"text":"Delicious, delicious. I've lived right next to this place for months and finally decided to try it. You get salsas and chips at the table (both options are spicy, but one will make your mouth burn and your eyes water). I wished it was more tomato-y salsa instead of sauces. Ordered the enchiladas verdes and chimichangas and two margaritas. The food was good, though a bit bland. Adding some of those spicy salsa sauces came in handy. The margaritas were delicious, but not very large (we ordered the large). Total amount was just over $40, with tip, for two people. Not bad! We'll be going again, but probably won't be making it our go-to for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Super authentic food & environment! I would recommend the chorizo tacos to anyone stopping by. The portions can be kind of large, but the tacos are normal-sized. The vide is very chill, and there are guaranteed to be smells from heaven wafting into you booth, begging the question: \"what are they having?\" I for one (self certified spice MASTER after conquering a bag of hot Cheetos) found the spice to be perfect! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican bites!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a gem.  It was fabulous to feel like I was eating real food that was well thought out and attractively displayed.  It was far superior to the usual Mexican fare.  It felt more like you had been invited over for dinner to someone's home, especially when the family/ owners sat down at a table near us to have their evening meal during a slow period.
I had the carna assada with onions which was very flavorful.  It was served with a side of cactus and a grilled pepper in addition to rice and beans.  My husband had the Lalo's Special which he couldn't stop talking about.  Our daughter ordered tacos with rice and beans.  My husband took a bite of her taco and just said, \"wow.\"
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, but especially those who love real food and a cozy setting."}
{"text":"WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.  Great atmosphere.  Wonderful service.  Extraordinary food.  We really enjoyed the place.  We will be back!  He and I both had a great time.  We wanted a little more seasoning to the chicken.  Salt,  Pepper,  Lime.  But everything was very very tasty and wonderful.  I hope it stays a long time.  My fiance and I enjoyed our night out.  We even told the staff how much we appreciated our experience.  Really good."}
{"text":"Best Mexican for your $ in Madison. Free chips and very good salsa. Authentic and delicious. Best nachos I've had in town. I would have given 5 stars, but if you order for pick-up the quality drops."}
{"text":"Well, well, well Wisconsin, I see you've produced another delicious, authentic Mexican restaurant. We were going to a movie in Hilldale and wanted to sip on a marg and dive into some chips and salsa beforehand. When I did a search for \"Mexican\" on google maps, it came up with Chipotle and Qdoba... which I mean, are fine, but the options around Hilldale seem to be limited to American/bar food/some Asian variations.

This restaurant happened to be celebrating their 1st anniversary so margaritas were $1.50 off and some new menu items were 25% off. There was also a mariachi kind of musician DJ'ing music, and he was offering free shots of tequila for the guests to \"relax and enjoy\" their evenings. Hah. It was a fun environment, and I could tell the employees liked each other.

The two variations of salsa were delicious, but what is preventing me from the full 5 stars is that the chips were \"eh.\" They didn't seem homemade, and they were bland. And, the waitress took three reminders to bring us water along with our margs, but she was really nice about it and didn't seem annoyed by our requests.

I'll definitely go back if we're on that side of town, and I would also make a special trip out there again if I'm craving Mexican."}
{"text":"More authentic than most Mexican places around town here (even the \"legit\" ones). Be sure to visit on weekends for pozole."}
{"text":"Not all Mexican food is created equal--and Lalo's is here to prove it. Staff is friendly, chips are served with a mild red salsa and crazy spicy green salsa that is impressive but beware. The star of the evening was the grilled fish tacos, which were awesomely seasoned and topped with caramelized onions and cilantro. Do yourself a favor and try them, seriously. Great Mexican bottled beer selection to boot."}
{"text":"I've been to Lalo's three times, and really want to love it, but they are going in the wrong direction.  The first time, shortly after they opened, the food was great, as was the service.  On that visit, in addition to our orders, the owner brought out tamales for us to sample.  The second time, our experience was good, but not exceptional, but service was attentive.  On our most recent trip, we saw our server when the order was taken, when salsa and chips came, when the food was delivered, and when the bill was presented.  No check-in on quality or food satisfaction.  My friend's chile relleno was undercooked - it took a steak knife to cut it.  There was one chile relleno, a small portion of unexceptional Mexican rice, and a shmear of beans.  My fajitas were gristly and dry.  I am sorry that I no longer love Lalo's.  There are enough authentic Mexican restaurants in town that Lalo's needs to be better than mediocre."}
{"text":"Friendly family-run Mexican restaurant that's a nice addition in Madison.  Your complimentary chips come with two tasty salsas, one of which is delighfully hot.  The menu's not large, but there's plenty of choice, and folks keep checking in to make sure you're enjoying the food. So far we've tried the nachos, the enchiladas verdes and the fajitas and we liked everything."}
{"text":"Great food but slow service. Check this place out when you've got some time to spare. The food is worth the wait. Reasonable pricing too."}
{"text":"We went here a couple of days ago to give it a try.  Not terrific.  First, it was busy (which is fine) so we were sat in the back/lower end.  Four of the fluorescent lights were flickering on and off.  Very, very annoying and unpleasant.  Gave the entire place an incredibly cheap, sleazy feeling.  Waitstaff were fine.  Salsas brought out with the chips were pretty good; one very spicy the other quite mild, so something for everyone.  Our food however was less than stellar.  Very bland in fact.

I had the Lalos fajitas.  Steak was riddled with gristle and fat.  No flavor to it at all.  The chicken was also fatty and flavorless.  Fajitas are served with corn tortillas.  I can't stand corn tortillas, but these were especially bland and bad, not to mention ridiculously small.  You can get a couple of strips of meat, an onion or pepper on it, forget getting sour cream or guac on it.  Incredibly ridiculous choice.  Should be flour, and should be three times the size at least.

My daughter had the beef chimichanga.  The beef is just hamburger, also bland and no seasoning.  On all dishes the rice and refried beans were flavorless and frankly could not compare to canned varieties found at Woodmans or HyVee.

My wife's order was brought out sans avocado, and it took forever to get it.  My mother's dish was bland and room temperature when delivered.

Lalo's has a lot of work to do.  I cannot understand how there can be so many good reviews.  It is clear that people do not know what authentic, good-tasting Mexican food tastes like.  If you want something that will knock your socks off, go to El Pastor on Park St.  They set the bar for this town."}
