{"text":"Sushi was nice, fresh fish of a good quality, but, a bit pricey and the service was a little hit and miss. Took about 20 minutes to bring our drinks which was rather long when we calculated about one server for every table ! All in all though, perfectly fine for a quick meal if you are near by, but I wouldn't go out of your way."}
{"text":"Very good value.  They have a 4 course \"table d'hote\" for about $20 pp.  Also, the service by the older Japanese ladies was quite good... they care."}
{"text":"Whoever went to japan should never go to this restaurant again!  if you've never been to japan and if you are happy with this restaurant, i feel so miserable for you.  very slow service and ignore customers until Japanese OLD women waitress and an old woman manager feel good to serve. If we ask something, \"busy\". \"not now\" \" so slow now\" they just make excise.  Don't expect service. Not 100 % Japanese service. They speak non-educational Japanese language. I feel so embarrassed to hear so rude Japanese language.   If you go, that's less than fast food restaurant service.  Old Japanese females waitress are working not efficiently. They work as old style. That's why most Japanese living in montreal hate going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is an above average Chinese/Japanese fast food spot located in the 5th Street Arcade.   If you go to a mall and get Asian food there and like it, then you'll love this place. It is far better than any other fast food Chinese/Japanese place that I can find in a mall-like setting.  Don't go in thinking you're going to be blown away by their food and expect to get something like you would from an actual sit down sushi bar or some other fancy place. This place is what it is, simple food at an affordable price, which is great for lunch.  For 5.99 I get my favorite dish, the Chicken Teriyaki. The servings are huge. I can almost finish one entire dish in a sitting, and I'm not a light eater. :)  For lunch, I tell everyone to go there if they want some good food for lunch at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great restaurant hidden in the 5th St. Arcade. I didn't realize it has been downtown for 10 years now. But, that sounds about right.  No matter what I get from their menu, it is constantly good, & I have tried pretty much everything outside the sushi.  Today, I tried something new - their shrimp & broccoli. They had to make it fresh since it wasn't on their regular daily set-up. But, it was quick & right. (I requested no carrots.) Highly recommend to anyone who wants a quick bite downtown at lunchtime."}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki chicken. Perhaps I ordered the wrong item because is was swimming in teriyaki sauce and was just overwhelming for me.  The rice and veggies were just ok. Nothing special.  I would try this place again just a different dish."}
{"text":"What makes this place so great? It's the only affordable Asian restaurant I'm aware of that doesn't use 'mystery meat.' They actually use fresh chicken, steak and shrimp and cook it up right in front of you. I haven't tried their sushi yet, because I'm so stuck on the hibachi lunch special. You get a protein or two (if you do a combo) and then you can get fried or white rice and veggies (tons of onions, some mushrooms and some other things). I always get the chicken terriaki with fried rice and veggies and it's $6, for a huge portion. They give you a ton of food, definitely enough to share in my opinion. The steak, shrimp and combo's are more, but they are also good and worth the price. Do yourself a favor and try this place if you are a hibachi fan."}
{"text":"We were craving Sushi and after checking what was open for lunch, we remembered our old favorite haunt in the Golden Square Mile near Holts.  But I've never been to the new location on Drummond.  I was happy they still had the Samurai Bento box lunch special.  A good variety of sushi, sashimi, and tempura along with a starter miso soup, a salad, and a green tea ice cream dessert.  It was exactly what I needed. Service was very quick/efficient and the food was really good.  I like the new place, but it could look a little disheveled on first appearances.    I definitely liked the lunch special and left the restaurant feeling packed."}
{"text":"Out sightseeing before the cavs game and we stopped in the arcade food court for lunch. The food was cheap and filling. Nothing great and definitely nothing bad. I would eat here again but I don't think this spot will ever be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Sakura is a nice restaurant with friendly staff, good decor, and efficient cleanliness. However, to me, the food is only a bit above, if not, average; and the higher price does not match the quality of the food I was expecting.  The miso soup is way too salty and hardly meet the basics of a good miso soup with ingredients and the quality of the miso they use. The sushi rolls taste pretty standard and not as special as I had thought when noticing the value on the menu. I wouldn't say it is a disappointment but definitely there are other Japanese restaurant in Montreal where you can get better authentic sushi and japanese cuisine for a more reasonable price.   The restaurant does have a nice ambience and I really do hope they increase the quality, the variety, and the specialty of the food. Then perhaps I would give it another chance sometimes in the future."}
{"text":"The crowd in this one is mostly Japanese--which is the first good sign. So are the staff and the ever-important sushi master. Not cheap, but genuine Japanese food experience.  The place is big but quite dark though. Not a single window."}
{"text":"Its St. Patrick's Day in Montreal.   There are plenty of cool Irish Pubs all over the place in Montreal. Walking through the city there are green shirts...shamrock hats....shamrock sunglasses and even Irish Spring reps handing out liquid soap everywhere!    Where does our team end up for dinner?  Sakura.  Was I disappointed, you bet your Guiness butt I was!!!  So, deep breath, we walk in the door and are met with a darling interior.  Serene, wait staff in authentic Obi garments and lo and behold a GREEN buddah in the corner next to the water feature. (rubbed his belly for luck)  Seated in a private area, after removing our shoes, the low table was minimalist in presentation...very nice.  On to the food...sake, sake and more sake.  (not green)  Soup - wonderful Miso and a great beef consume Salad - artistic in presentation-crisp greens, cukes, tomatoes and a swash of sesame dressing Sushi - you name it we had it.  For me the salmon, mackerel and tuna were the best I've had.  There were a few rolls including tempura soft-shell crab, avocado and spicy tuna as well as a bit of sashimi with a lovely ponzu sauce.  Feeling like an Arctic seal who was able to feed without predator interference.........we were stuffed!  Finished the evening with a bit of red bean ice cream and orange sherbert...we all left satisfied with our dining experience.  Did I miss my regular Irish festivities?  Yes, but there is always 2010"}
{"text":"I first heard of Sakura in a gastronomical guide book. It was presented as an almost legendary restaurant, boasting of 43 years of history. It was founded at a time when the average Montrealer had very little knowledge of authentic Japanese food, which is why Sakura feels both old school and Westernized. Among its most unique and traditionnal features, however, is the kaiseki, a multi-course dinner where each dish follows a sequence where esthetics and balance are at play.   The guide book mentioned that among famous patrons of the restaurant was Prime Minister Trudeau senior. Apparently, young Justin Trudeau had also enjoyed his family meals there, as he recently cited Sakura as one of his favorite spots in Montreal. At the center of this restaurant is \"Mamasan\", the owner, a gracious lady rumored never to take a day off. When I first visited the place with friends 3 years ago, she was indeed there, overseeing the dining room. The dinner service was pleasant and courteous, and the room quiet and intimate. The food was nicely prepared and presented. We had a great meal. My colleagues and I visited the place for lunch three times since then. The \"special of the day\" was my favorite pick, as it was both affordable and delicious.   Our last visit (May 2016), however, was perplexing. I ordered the special of the day, which was a tuna bowl. The food came after quite a long wait, and, well, the tuna wasn't fresh. The meat had been breaded and fried, then soaked in sauce until it was mushy. It wasn't very Japanese, which was embarassing because we were welcoming a Japanese professor (he had ordered the same dish). I wondered if there had been some change in the kitchen. Mamasan was nowhere in sight.   I've been fond of Sakura in the past, but I'm not so sure now."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic sushi and tempura! We had the 50$ omakase menu which filled me up and is great value! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place whenever I'm in Montreal. Not the cheapest sushi in town, but definitely some of the best.   The Kamikaze rolls are out of this world and practically the size of hockey pucks compared to the standard size sushi rolls everywhere else. Their Sashimi is also really fresh, and service is very friendly.   They have super quick take out as well."}
{"text":"Great, delicious Japanese food. They are generous with their food portions. They are located in the food court. I try come here once a week. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Sakura is basically mall food. Sure they do \"hibachi\" style meals in the vein of Benihana at an affordable price (even with the steak and yum-yum sauces), but ultimately the food just didn't taste like anything special.  I got the chicken teriyaki, which comes with a buttload of rice and a side of veggies (which was really just stir fried zucchini). Definitely filling, but again, nothing special. I appreciate that everything is cooked hot and fresh in front of you, but they certainly are not the only fast food place in the area to do that.  If we're really going to compare it to other Asian mall joints, Sakura doesn't really stand out. I'd still go to Sakkio Japan and the like over this any day."}
{"text":"I was first introduced this restaurant back during my Undergrad years and while I was taking a Japanese class as a credit filler. This is apparently the only restaurant (though there are more - check out Aka-Fuji in Verdun or Kazu in DT) where the owners are Japanese. The clientele are generally Japanese which is a good sign.  However, this is where the buck stops for me. The sushi is of good quality, but it is quite traditional. You will not find the fusion rolls, or deep friend somethings here. The service is ok and the restaurant is clean. (BTW it is now located in the former El Morroco Restaurant). The decor is a mix of Japanese and a bit of Moroccan in the entrance, so it makes for a odd mix.  The food is ok, the price is above average, so if you are looking for a better experience, it may be better to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Arrived a half hour before they closed and they were very accommodating and patient. Had the sushi and sashimi combo which came with miso soup, tempura appetizer, and ice cream for desert. The food was great, and more than filled me up. The price was very reasonable considering everything I got. May stop in again for lunch tomorrow, definitely pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"A superior Japanese restaurant.  The menu is normal - few surprises here.  (Except at the upper end where they offer a few lobster dishes).  What makes things work is the high quality of the raw ingredients  and the execution not to waste same.  Notably the teriyaki beef uses a much better cut of beef than I have had in Japanese restaurants elsewhere in North America.  My tablemate reports that her salmon was a better piece of fish than the farmed nonsense that gets called salmon where we come from.  (Not all the ingredients were super-ingredients. The shrimp we had were stringy and bland.)  Better raw ingredients. Better dishes.   Much better than the Japanese I get at home."}
{"text":"Just yuk. Truly. Fishy. Warm. Dark mystery fish. Threw half out."}
{"text":"This restaurant moved from rue de la Montagne perhaps about 1-2 years back, and I find that this new place looks brighter and cleaner.    We've been here several times as a family, and have always found the service to be excellent.  This is a kid-friendly place.  The servers are attentive to our and the kids' needs.  The sushi, handrolls and tempura etc are fresh and meet our expectations for a Japanese restaurant.  In addition, what's truly unique here is its Sukiyaki!  This is the Japanese hotpot - with finely-sliced beef cooked quickly in simmering Japanese sauce and dipped in raw egg (optional).  Yum!  Just the thing for a cold / snowy day in Montreal!  This is typically a dinner dish, but we asked for it at lunch on a freezing day, they could whip it out in no time.  I believe the cost is around $70 for two.  There is a generous helping of sliced beef and fresh vegetables.  I haven't been able to find another Japanese restaurant in Montreal which serves Sukiyaki.    Considering how street parking can be a nightmare at Montreal, one other great thing about this restaurant is its free parking.  Yep, FREE.  You park at the parking lots in the compound outside the restaurant, and obtain a placard from the restaurant to display on your dashboard.  We were just told about this new arrangement in Dec 2013.   So overall, this is a great family restaurant, and there are more secluded spots in the restaurant where it would be more conducive for a business dinner / lunch."}
{"text":"Note that this restaurant was formerly on Mountain, but has moved to 3450 Drummond, above Sherbrooke, in 2012.  It is now hidden away at the bottom of an apartment building.  Before the move this was one of my favorite sushi restaurants, particularly because of it's traditional Japanese style and cuisine.  I am really not a fan on the various rolls and Vietnamese \"creations\" (including California and other rolls) that are called \"sushi\" these days because I find them to be the club sandwiches of the sushi trade.    As of early 2013 the menu is still biased towards traditional Japanese sushi, with a real old-school itamae-class chef behind the bar.  The freshness appearance of the plates, and speed of the service, however, is not as good as it once was and I am not inclined to award the place as many starts as before.  I am hoping they will get things better under control in their new (more obscure) location and bring the place back up to the standard I remember.  The decor remains quite traditional and the staff wear traditional Japanese garb and treat their patrons in a classic style, but the overall feel of the place is less polished and exclusive than one would expect at an upper-end restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent-value sushi, nigiri and soft shell crab tempura. Will definitely be back to Sakura next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The rice looked so delicious, but it ended up being so dry.  No egg in it.  The chicken in the Chicken Teriyaki is pretty delicious.  My wife loved the shrimp.  She really loved the spring rolls, just what you would expect from a mall restaurant.   Nothing to write home about.  I really wish they had Beef and Broccoli, but it may not have been as good either.  :(  But if you are staying in the hotel it will be fine for you."}
{"text":"Good food, they're not shady with their portion sizes either. The staff laughs and talks with you and makes sure your order is correct. There is a wait when you order sushi or California rolls. But it's totally worth it. It's always made fresh every day and you can see them cut the avocado, and which I've had bad at other locations but never this one. You can tell they take pride in their food/job. I eat here for lunch maybe 2 times a week and it's always sushi/California roll. It's my go to light lunch."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! We went there for New Years Eve dinner with 3 generations of family, all who enjoyed the meal. The tempura was delicious, lightly battered and crisp with soft shell crab. The sushi course was delicious, perfect sushi rice and fresh fish. The main course was a steamed half lobster with ponzu sauce for dipping. The service was so friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get. Their plates looked like miniature samples, very deceiving taste wise, presentation and price wise. I really don't recommend this place unless you're under -40 and starving outside their door."}
{"text":"I think there are only two words to describe what is Sakura, value & chaos. Sakura is located in a tiny little spot in the middle of the 5th Street Arcade downtown. I love the location because of the small shop atmosphere  in the Arcade and the wide mix of people who frequent the building, plus it's close to my work. Sakura is in the tiny \"food court\" of the building and is really a gem. I bring up \"Chaos\" to describe Sakura because that's what your experience is like when waiting in line for your food. 3 ethnic Asian guys are running the place, 1 cooking, 1 preparing to go boxes and the other guy taking orders and grabbing drinks. The typical person comes here for the \"hibachi\" style meal of Chicken, Steak, Shrimp or Veggie Teriyaki. The prices are wonderful ranging from $5.99 to $6.75 for an entrée. They do serve sushi and combo meals but I tend to stick with one of the main four.   The line is always a pain in the butt at lunchtime (I have been there a handful of times between 12 and 130) and it is always busy during these times. You wait and once your order is taken it is almost becomes a no holds bar death match to get in another line and fight for your food. I've seen it look like a Royal Rumble on one particular occasion. Eventually someone will get you your food but sometimes it is a struggle.   The food though! You get a fresh protein with a heaping side of white or fried rice and veggies (lots of onions, zucchini and mushrooms). Oh and that YUM YUM sauce to add really makes this meal fantastic and filling. Don't get me wrong it's not better than say a top hibachi place but for $5.99 how the hell can you beat that. What can I say I enjoy the food, the line is a pain but well worth in my opinion the best VALUE lunch spot downtown."}
{"text":"This restaurant was chosen because my dining companion loves sushi. He rated it as 4 stars, i am rating as 3 stars because i was annoyed with how slow the service was... given the restaurant was not that busy.  There were private rooms, with screens and also a sushi bar area. It looks like this restaurant could seat a large number of people.    We ordered the sushi \"love boat\", appropriately themed specials for Valentine's Day.  This special came with a variety of sushi and tempura as well as lychee cocktails. The sushi seemed fresh and was presented in a lively manner.  Nagiri was also flavorful. We had green tea ice cream for dessert.   For me the real star of the show was the lychee cocktail and the lychee saki. yum!"}
{"text":"Good food. Very fresh fish, and I am usually extremely picky with my sushi, but I was completely satisfied.   The ONLY reason I am not giving this place five stars is because of the price. $38 for one avocado roll, two pieces of sushi salmon, and one specialty roll? If you're on a budget, not the place for you. If your parents are in town and want to take you out somewhere, it is."}
{"text":"Sakura is a small takeout place in the Colonial Arcade with two separate but adjoining counters - one for your basic food court style Chinese, and the other for freshly-prepared hibachi dishes and sushi.  I have not had the sushi or Chinese (neither of which, unfortunately, look appealing), so my review is based solely on the yummy hibachi food.    Upon ordering, you have a choice of meats (chicken, steak, shrimp or veggies), with shrimp, I think, being the most expensive at $6.75.  You also have your choice of steamed or Chinese fried rice. Steamed, in my opinion, is the only way to go here, lest you upset the delicate harmony of flavors once you add all the different sauces. The sauces! I'll get back to that in a minute...  So once you're paid up and you choose your options,a friendly hibachi guy will throw a generous portion of your chosen protein and veggies (onions, zucchini, mushrooms) onto the superhot grill, tossing everything together while occasionally adding a big pat from this giant cone of butter that hangs out next to the grill. When the food is almost done, a very tasty teriyaki sauce and sesame seeds are added to the stirfry.  There are several condiments available, and I have found my perfect combination - two little tubs of the meat sauce (a sweet soy sauce w/ ginger and garlic), a tub of seafood sauce (creamy horseradish sauce) and one tub of crushed chili pepper in chili oil. I toss those sauces with the steamed rice and veggies and it is just...perfect!  Ideally, you will have a friend with you to split the order - I have never finished a whole one by myself, and I am definitely not a light eater!!  BTW, another plus: one of the only Arcade (either Colonial or Hyatt Regency) food vendors (I think Vincenzas is the only other one) that is not cash only... Sometimes, I just don't have time to walk to my bank to get cash, so being able to use plastic for a fast and cheap lunch is great!"}
{"text":"Sakura has Chinese and Japanese dishes. Great prices: sushi rolls for as low as $4.50 and hibachi dishes for less than $10.  I haven't had a poor experience yet - great spot to pick up lunch if you work downtown!"}
{"text":"Good, authentic, Japanese restaurant. The hostess and waitresses are in traditional Japanese garments and kimonos. The miso soup was excellent, the sushi was solid, but no crazy, hip rolls, or anything like that. Prices were a little too high for me, so I don't think i'd repeat the experience"}
