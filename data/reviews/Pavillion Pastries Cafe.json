{"text":"I am a downtown gal, and going to the Main Street subway was like a whole other  pedestrian-unfriendly world. It is Saturday afternoon and many stores are closed. The Pavilion seems out of place here - a nice artsy little caf√© in the middle of whatever.   I told the cashier it was my first time there, and asked what chocolatey thing she would recommend. She suggested a brownie which was great. Moist, with a line of melty chocolate gooeyness in the middle. Comfy Church-pew type seating, not too busy.   Service was friendly and fast, everything was clean. We stayed for 45 minutes in the small space and no one tried to hurry us along. I wouldn't travel for it, but would visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped here to grab a latte to try somewhere new. Service was extremely slow (understaffed?) and the coffee was so awful I had to throw it out. Same price as Starbucks very poor quality. You can get the same menu across the street at Tim Hortons which would be better quality and better price."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located right outside of Main Street Station. After finishing a late lunch and craving sweets, a friend and I stopped by for dessert for our subway ride back to downtown Toronto. The cafe was filled with a delicious aroma of baked goods ranging from cookies to banana bread to brownies and cakes. I was curious about this one particular sweet which I believe is called loukoumades, a Greek doughnut ($3.75/12pcs) sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon, yum! I was even offered a free sample before deciding I wanted a full dozen - score! The best way I can describe what it's similar to would be a honey cruller timbit or just any fried donut hole soaked in a honey or sugar syrup. If you've ever had Turkish lokma, tulumba or Indian gulab jamun, I highly recommend giving this a try!! It's so incredibly delicious.    There is very minimal seating so I wouldn't recommend going as a large group but this place seems perfect for when you want to catch up on some work or start a good read! They serve coffee and tea too! And have free wifi. Will most definitely be back for a dozen more of their doughnuts!   Server was extremely helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Church St location: friendly, welcoming, and very reasonably priced. I never feel rushed and I love the big windows. The Vietnamese coffee is great."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.. average... coffee good.  Old rustic design. Every minutes people coming in and out.. its just right beside the main station... easy to see."}
{"text":"This is such an awesome place cause it's quit An clean An the owner is super awesome An totally friendly"}
{"text":"Good place. Bagels are very good. Address is wrong, it is on Main Street , near subway."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times as it is next to my subway station.  The owner is a very nice person. But when he isn't there the service is spotty and not consistent like the coffee.  To be honest if it wasn't the only coffee shop by the subway I would never go back."}
{"text":"The service was really nice. I've been here twice so far. I love the honey balls and their mochachino! My friends and I just sat there and talked even after we finished our foods and drinks. I'm so glad they didn't kick us out or anything. I would like to go back again and try the other menu items! Also the price was super good! For the quality of the things I was getting, the price was fantastic! Its a quiet place so I think its fine if a child comes in but they probably can't stay there."}
{"text":"Been Stoppin' in here for about 3 years now. Nice little place, good coffee and they always have more than enough fresh pastries to sugar your lips to. Friendly quiet and just a stones throw from Main Subway station. This has proven a good thing when you just missed that bus and have a 20 minute wait for the next one. Gives more than enough time to walk over and grab something."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  Pavillion Pastries Cafe is located near Main Subway Station so it is convenient to pick up an early morning coffee. Americano ($1.69) was decent!  However,  Galaktobouriko ($3.50)  was disappointing. The phyllo was soggy, the filling was dry and hard... Yelp friend, thanks so much for finishing that!   The staff was super nice even gave me a free sample of Loukoumades which was fresh and just have the perfect level of sweetness!  Pavillion Pastries Cafe is a good neighbourhood cafe but not worth a special trip."}
