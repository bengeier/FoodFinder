{"text":"Wonderful neighboorhood café ! Beautifully decorated, this cozy place will charm you by its simplicity. The staff is all smiles and very inviting. Almost felt I was dinning at a friend's house. The food and crepes are wonderful. Not pretentious at all. I had the eggs benedictine which I really enjoyed. The pommes dauphine were surprisingly good. Very affordable, I will definitely be back. I recommend!"}
{"text":"We were here while on a mini vacation. From the outside, this restaurant is small and does not have much advertisement on the outside, and it was a little confusing to enter since there is a huge vegan restaurant right next to it, but once we got in, it was well worth it! The food was unique, beautiful in its presentation and absolutely delicious. We were there with a party of 6 people and everyone found something on the menu to suit their taste. The staff was very attentive, knowledgeable and polite. The crepes are available in buckwheat flour option, which are delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch while in town for a friend's wedding and we were very impressed. Delicious savory buckwheat crepes (gluten free ) and for $5 you can add on fruit, yogurt, potatoes and coffee which was all fantastic. Instead of the home fries we were expecting, they brought out three deep fried mashed potato nuggets of pure delight! Fruit was freshly chopped and not just a pile of melon. Coffee was great as well as the service. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Lovely little cafe. I stopped by for lunch. The crepe was tasty and filling. You can choose from the menu or create your own. I just added chicken to the goat cheese, honey, spinach, and walnut crepe.   The service was wonderful! Our server was so nice and patient, and of course, attentive."}
{"text":"Leurs galettes sont savoureuses! On nous accueille toujours avec sourire et bonne humeur."}
{"text":"A fabulous little restaurant on Mont-Royal offers great service and exceptional food with origin from Bretagne, France. Melt in your mouth, the food is delicious and well presented. Try their egg benedict! It's a must on the plateau!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Best eggs Benedict I have ever had! Servers were friendly and coffee is fresh. Nice open window with a sight of local art. Potato puffs or whatever they are called are superb! Would totally recommend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ce petit resto de quartier propose un petit déjeuner ou un lunch sympathique dans un environnement sans prétention.   J'ai essayé les crosmesquis au jambon,  fromage et champignons.  Miam petites bouchées de bonheur.  Puis, j'ai choisi la galette de sarrasin au jambon fromage béchamel et j'ai été agréablement surprise par la côte 'crunchy' de la galette très goûteuse.  Pour finir,  j'ai complété avec une traditionnelle crêpe au sucre qui était vraiment parfaite. Mon menu était sur la table d'hôte et le prix était vraiment raisonnable.   Joli décor,  service courtois et bons petits plats,  ce restaurant vous procurera un moment de détente et un ventre très satisfait."}
{"text":"Came on Sunday for brunch. Very friendly staff and the food was beautifully presented and delicious. A good variety of Benedicts and a huge choices of crepes.   I'm a huge smoked salmon fan so opted for the salmon Benedict. They also have a scallops Benedict with baby spinach...wish I have 2 stomachs.   The salmon Benedict comes with asparagus and capers. The hollandaise sauce was really fresh tasting and yummy. Very lemony. The look is beautiful and tasted great too. The asparagus were a bit over cooked but still good overall in the dish.   Breakfast comes with mini fruit salad, yogurt and the most delicious croquettes. Piping out and perfectly crispy on the outside and so creamy on the inside.   Pretty quiet place too, not blasting lout music and the crowd is mellow. Definitely would recommend to come here for breakfast brunch and lunch!  Everything looks good from other tables too."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast or brunch spot.  Coffee is very good.  The servings are very appropriate.  Great eggs benedictine and really good crepes and galletes.  Would def come again."}
{"text":"This place was pretty empty on a Saturday morning during prime brunch hour. I think the word lukewarm describes my experience pretty much as accurately as possible. Everything from the hollandaise sauce on my eggs Benedict to the coffee and tea served with my meal was luke warm.   They start the meal off with a fruit salad and yogurt. The yogurt is plain so veers into the sour side. Then I got my eggs Benedict with prosciutto and blue cheese. Pungent is the best way to describe that dish. Be warned, only order it if you truly love the smell and taste of sock.   In general the place is quiet and brightly lit from natural sunlight but the nice decor didn't make up for the lackluster meal."}
{"text":"Un bon resto, une carte variée et une ambiance sympathique. Je recommande la poutine raclette est originale, raffinée et très savoureuse. L'endroit est agreable et les proprietaires chaleureux, ils ne manqueront pas de faire en sorte que vous passez un bon repas. Les galettes sont tres fines, dans l'ensemble on sent la qualité des produits et l'attention portée sur les plats. Le rapport qualité-prix est excellent, on sort de Pausez vous repus et avec l'envie d'y retourner au plus vite!"}
{"text":"I used to live just a few blocks from this \"new\" crepes joint...I miss it! Sit by the window and people watch les plateauiens (a.k.a) ppl living on the plateau! It's one of the best crepes spot in Montreal and it deserves to be known as such.  Try the salted Sarasin (buckwheat) crepes - they are crispy and buttery and hit the spot every time...my favourite is the goat cheese with honey and walnut. Smiling service. If they could have organic crepes option, I'd definitely give 5 star. The decor is nice and simple - perhaps it needs a touch of art and personality to make it a very unique place? That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The portions are quite large and the price is very affordable as well. I will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Les patates !!! Elles sont parfaites. Et quand les patates sont parfaites, le reste l'ait ! Vraiment adoré l'endroit. Je vous le conseille fortement ! Miiiiiam"}
{"text":"This brunch place is good, but I find the food a bit bland. Everything I tried lacked a bit of flavor. However, it seems healthier than other places. I love that they give yogurt as a side.   The place is very small and get easily get crowded during the weekend. The staff is nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Voilà c'est le lieu où j'ai découvert les ufs bénédictines, quelques temps après mon arrivée à Montréal. Depuis, j'en ai mangé a d'autres endroits et en fait ce sont certainement celles que je préfère. La sauce est tellement goûteuse, onctueuse, ..  J'ai été séduite par les pommes dauphines qui viennent en accompagnement des ufs bénédictines... comme un goût d'enfance. Un vrai délice! C'est vrai que les premières fois que j'y suis allée c'était très calme, toujours de la place. Ce dimanche, c'était plein et on a attendu pour avoir une table (bon pas longtemps hein genre 5mins). Je me dis que c'est bien, ce resto commence à être reconnu dans le quartier mais aussi que ce sera certainement plus dur d'y aller prochainement... Tant pis! Je leur souhaite beaucoup de réussite! Vive les pommes dauphines, Vive Pause & vous!!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Had lunch there and looking forward to trying breakfast. They were kid friendly: welcomed us with our stroller, and there was another young kid in there too. The bathroom is large enough for having a changing table: that would be a nice improvement. I'm planning to go back."}
{"text":"Great place for eggs Benedict at a very decent price. Our group of six tried both the classic Benedict and salmon Benedict. The salmon was apparently a bit dull but I personally enjoyed the classic. Hollandaise sauce had just the right balance. The service was also great. If you want good brunch without the long lines, this is a good bet."}
{"text":"Amazing gluten free buckwheat crepes. One of my favorite eateries in Montreal. We ended up eating here 3 times during our week here. Such a treat for someone who is gluten free."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! It seemed a little silly of me to order eggs benedict at a creperie with so many creative and delicious options, but I am very glad i did! The best eggs benny ive ever had, and thats saying quite a lot ( i eat a lot of eggs benny :P). The staff are very attentive and are  looking to please. Very clean and modern, look gives out the perfect vibe for a nice relaxing breakfast/ or whatever meal youre eating. I will definitely be back and highly recommend going!"}
{"text":"Un endroit comme je les aime. Pas de chichis et de la nourriture excellente. Passer pile poile pendant l'anniversaire, des plats proposés en promo. On s'est laissé tenter par les ufs bénédictines au canard. Servi avec des petits cromesquis fait maison. Autant vous dire que j'étais à deux pas de demander un supplément ! Petit fromage blanc et des fruits avec un café. J'y retournerais sans hésiter. Pour un brunch ou un repas sur le pouce le midi c'est parfait."}
{"text":"Cette petite place de crêpes et brunchs est super bien située sur l'avenue Mont Royal, pas loin du métro Mont Royal et de bornes Bixi l'été Les galettes sont super bonnes, le service très agréable, l'endroit est tout plein de charme, bref, on y est bien accueilli et on s'y sent bien! Les desserts aussi sont excellents, dignes de grands pâtissiers aux prix vraiment abordables! L'été, il y a un comptoir qui donne sur la rue, sympa pour observer les gens se balader :) Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Service exemplaire, plats bien pensés et originaux, bon mélange de saveurs et de textures. Un petit joyau à découvrir qui a ouvert ses portes depuis peu. Avec l'offre anémique en restaurants de brunch dans cette partie de la rue, c'est maintenant un incontournable pour moi."}
{"text":"Soooo much yum! Fresh ingredients, creative crepes, friendly service, and delicious food make this place the perfect brunch spot. Much love for the potato cheese croquette hash browns that came with the fruit, yogurt and potato add on to my crepe. I loved my buckwheat crepe! Big portions - come hungry!"}
{"text":"We had a great brunch in Pause et Vous during our trip to Montreal. The food was great, the presentation was amazing and the service was outstanding!  I read about eggs Benedict with duck in MTL blog that's why we came to the restaurant to try them. As promised- the eggs were super delicious. My friend had a crepe with blue cheese and pears- it was good but a little too heavy because of the cheese. Both breakfast options came with coffee, yogurt, potatoes and fruit - it was simply delicious and beautiful!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedictine was great. The fried mashed potato that comes with breakfast combo is a must try. Excellent service from cute staff. Lovely ambiance. Would love to come back to try their crepe."}
{"text":"J'ai pas mal hésité entre 4 et 5, pour une seule raison : la poutine revisitée raclette. Dire que j'aimais pas ça... et me voilà à chercher s'ils ne peuvent pas me la livrer !! Des pommes dauchines maison, avec proscuitto et fromage raclette... MIAM !  Pour le reste, oeufs béné classiques, bons et efficaces ! Ce qui est top aussi, c'est la petite présentation pour les pommes de terre, fruits et fromage blanc. Très agréable ! Comme ailleurs (quand c'est bon !), mais présentation une coche au-dessus... un petit gout de reviens-y, pour tester leurs salades =)"}
{"text":"I decided to try the place after hearing about it and wasn't disappointed.  I had the Benedict Eggs with duck, it was very good. The hollandaise sauce was exquisite.  The staff was nice, atmosphere relatively calm."}
{"text":"Petit resto qui gagne à être connu! Je m'y suis rendue un samedi vers 10 h 30 pour un brunch, et j'ai été plus que satisfaite. La sélection de galettes au sarrasin et de crêpes sucrées est étourdissante, et vraiment alléchante! On peut les choisir en formule déjeuner complet, avec un café, des pommes dauphines maisons, du yogourt et des fruits. C'est parfait, on est bien remplis! Le service est excellent, à essayer."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! But a sad egg story...  My boyfriend and I both ordered the smoked salmon eggs Benedict. The dish came with a side of yoghurt, potato croquettes, and small fruit salad; a bit like an entrée. We were also given free coffee or tea. All included in the dish we ordered (good deal for ~$16)!  Now, the eggs Benedict. The portions of salmon were generous, hollandaise sauce was great, and asparagus added to the taste, but the eggs...! The  poached eggs were overcooked. I was hoping to see the yolk flowing on the plate while cutting the egg, but it didn't happen. A bummer!  We then told the server that the eggs were overcooked, and she asked us whether we wanted new eggs. However, we did not bother ordering new eggs since we would have to wait again and it would be a waste of food. Bottom line of the story: the service was friendly, but the eggs were a turn off.  Would I go there again? Yes, why not give it one more try."}
{"text":"Nothing great about this place. Hours suck  Are open at worst times and not late at night. If you have nothing better to dingo here. It's a small Ricky dink place bad decoration with a mediocre product that also includes there coffee"}
{"text":"Had an early supper here. Everything was good, however.....I did not like the crepes. They were bland and dry. Maybe a bad batch, but I was unimpressed. The rest however was good.  Staff was extremely friendly and the place was clean and nice."}
{"text":"When the line at L'Avenue was too long to contemplate waiting in on a freezing rainy morning, we walked around Mont Royal until we found a place with no line and a table open under the window. My partner's Benedict was awesome, but my build-your-own potato/brie/mushroom crepe was less than stellar-- the potatoes were in huge chunks rather than slices and appeared to have been boiled rather than pan-cooked, and there wasn't nearly enough brie to balance out the dryness of the potatoes. However, the service was great, and I was too hungry to be too picky. And the coffee was great."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes and their mimosas have cider instead of champagne but it tasted really good! Sweet and savory crepes. The place is small and we had to wait a little while for service. They're not very fast there but they're super friendly!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Understated but great, friendly service. Eggs Benedict with gruyere cheese were amazing as was the buckwheat crepe. Recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this but I was truly disappointed.  Hollandaise sauce is hot hot butter, fresh yolks and lemon juice whisked together into the most delicious and velvety sauce ever. I have no idea what Pause et Vous's sauce was, but it wasn't REAL Hollandaise. Even though the eggs were cooked well, and the ham, and the cheese, it was a real bummer for this Eggs Benedict fan. The rest was ok.  My wife ordered a crepe that she said was adequate. Nothing stood out for us. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Les oeufs bénédictines sont bons, j'ai adoré celui au fromage bleu, prosciutto et noix de grenoble !  Le vrai gros plus de cette place est sans conteste les pommes dauphine maison qui sont justes délicieuses. Elles sont exécutées parfaitement. De plus récemment on peut les transformer en poutine ! MIAM MIAM :)  Le service est sympathique, il s'agit d'une belle découverte sur l'avenue Mont Royal. je le recommande à tous mes amis fan de brunch car cela vaut le coup.Il est possible de réserver pour être sûr d'avoir sa place en arrivant :)"}
{"text":"Expérience très mitigée : l'endroit, le service et les pommes dauphines maison sont un plus, mais la crêpe au chèvre avec une mini tranche de chèvre posée sur un tas de salade et une galette nature...non ! J'aimerais y retourner mais je choisirai un autre plat."}
{"text":"I was wandering around aimlessly with a gf, looking for a place to eat. We stopped and checked out this place... it was completely empty on a sunday morning (ehhhhh bad sign???) but we decided to give it a shot anyway. OMG I'm so glad we did. Food was really good. Staff were wonderful. Prices are good. I would definitely suggest this place to friends & family!"}
{"text":"The eggs Benedict is incredible get it with the ham and you won't regret it!!!!! You need to come here and enjoy the food. The ambiance is also very fun and fresh.   Do use there lavatory as its like an acid trip. The coolest place I've been in quite sometime."}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch at Pause & Vous a couple of days ago and we both enjoyed the experience.   Located in the heart of the Plateau, the small restaurant serves buckwheat crepes, eggs, classic crepes, poutine and desserts. We had delicious benedictine eggs, accompanied by a side of fresh yogurt, fruits and three pommes dauphines (potato balls). The meal felt whole and was well balanced seasoning-wise.  The service was courteous and attentive, and the prices were fair, perhaps even a bit of a steal considering the quality of the food provided.  We liked it and recommend it wholeheartedly!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch during our stay in Montreal. It's a quaint place with minimalist furniture and really cool paper ribbons hanging from the ceiling. The ambience was very chill and relaxed, and the staff made us feel welcome.   I ordered the galette with goat cheese (can't remember the exact name), but it was so delicious and filling! The galette came with a cup of fruit and yogurt, as well as 3 croquettes - all just as yummy.   If I lived here, I'd definitely stop by this place to have a meal and study or read."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience here. I went yesterday ( on a Wednesday ) around 11:45 am. The waitress took our order, and then 20 minutes later she came back and said she lost the paper with our order and took it all over again. It took another 20 minutes to get our coffees. It took 1 hour to get our food, which was cold. First, my eggs Benedict with smoked salmon came, without the smoked salmon. Then, she took it back. It came back 2 minutes later with the salmon on it. My friend sat there without food. Mine was cold and mediocre. Next, my fruit bowl arrived. Another 5 minutes later my friends plate arrived. I was missing my potatoes. I asked for them. It took another 10 minutes. I was now finished my meal, and as I'm sure you would guess, I was quite annoyed. I told her to forget about the potatoes and we left very disappointed about our experience. There are WAY better options. No need to try this place."}
{"text":"Très certainement l'un des meilleurs endroits pour manger des crêpes à Montréal! Et un grand plus pour leurs pommes dauphines faites maison qui sont tout simplement excellentes! Je conseille fortement! Venez vous \"pauser\"!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 08/2016 - NOW UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT (they seem nice)   The good thing about crêpes/galettes, is that you can eat them day or night. The good thing about Pause et Vous, is that they make this a reality.   The space is cozy and welcoming, and the owners are delightful. As for the food, it's absolutely delicious. The crêpes are superb, with the perfect combination of classic and unique flavour combos. On the weekends, they also make really tasty eggs Benedict. Oh, and their pomme de terre dauphine are some of the best potatoes I've ever tasted.   Bonus: their galettes are made with buckwheat, so they're good to eat if you're gluten-free!   Oh, and if you're in a rush, you can get crêpes to-go! 5/5. Would crêpe again."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a disappointment coming here this morning. The crepes were really that fresh, and I saw the kitchen staff using the microwave. I ordered their crepe normande which is caramelized apples with salted caramel and almonds. But instead I was served mixed fruit with caramel and almonds. I could've and should've asked why my order changed, but I couldn't hassle with it.   Unfortunately we won't be back."}
{"text":"Les plats du brunch sont très originaux pour sortir des oeufs classiques. Le gout et le service était au rendez vous. Inconvénient : nous étions 8 personnes et cette place est plutôt petite donc l'attente a été longue."}
{"text":"We trusted the 4 star rating and came here to have a real crepe experience but were totally disappointed by the quality of the two crepes we ordered. They were too thick and didn't really smell fresh. The service was good however."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place. Service is very friendly but the food is ok. I tried the galette and the eggs Benedict on two occasions. Both were OK but nothing fancy."}
