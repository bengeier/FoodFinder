{"text":"I forgot all about Lee's sandwiches after coming here. I especially love their baguettes and affordable prices. There's not much to say other than amazing banh mi and great for if you need a quick but filling bite. Try their omelette banh mi!"}
{"text":"Love these sandwiches.     A very good value to boot!    Great bread.   Very pleasant help on my last few visits.    All my sons friends liked them when we provided lunch for them."}
{"text":"Very good baguettes.  I always get number 1.  And the Vietnamese coffee is really good."}
{"text":"Good clean Vietnamese Banh Mi sandwiches! A tad pricy but worth it. I especially like the bread/baguette used as it is crispy but not hard (doesn't scratch the roof of your mouth).

I also enjoy their meat filled puff pastries. Will need to come back and try their other fresh food."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches and the smoothies. Prices are very reasonable.

I've had both the chicken and one of the pork sandwiches. I really liked them both. The mango smoothie was so wonderful, cold, sweet and delicious. So many things there I want too try, so sad they are not on my side of town. I stop there every time I go to Mekong market."}
{"text":"Called in and they messed up my order by giving me someone else's order. That's a minus one star to begin with. Another two stars are deducted from their taste isn't even authentic and tasty. I've been to many Banh mi sandwich places and this one doesn't even compare to the ones I usually go to based on price. This place is also overpriced which is why I gave it two stars. The grilled pork and beef was very dry and bland. The special sandwich didn't taste good either. Overall very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love the # 5  grilled chicken Vietnamese sandwhich. The avacado smoothie is tasty as well. Havent tried anything else yet, but the food is tasty. Also very friendly service!"}
{"text":"Grilled beef is where it's at! love these sandwiches. I've tried them all"}
{"text":"The best Baguettes in town, delicious Vietnamese sandwiches and now they make delicious American sandwiches with Boar's Head meats and cheeses.  I love the Big Italian with Salami, Pepperoni, Ham, and Provolone.  They have a big Breakfast Sandwich with Eggs, Bacon, Ham or Sausage.  They now take credit cards which is convenient and the folks are friendly and nice. They have added Coke soft drinks and China Mist iced tea."}
{"text":"Great price, fresh baked bread and YUM! That's my opinion, take or leave it."}
{"text":"A sandwich place that ran out of bread midday! That's definitely a first and especially since they are next door to Mekong market which is filled with different types of breads."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for pork sandwiches. But the beef stew is also incredible like nothing I've had before. It is a family recipe and a must to try."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their sandwiches a very hot and fresh. The staff is very friendly. The very best place for Vietnamese sandwiches."}
{"text":"i got the grill chicken it was ok, a little dry. im giving this a two star because the price doesn't even match. it's a dollar more than the pic on here. i think it's too pricey for something that's pretty basic and nothing special. i usually pay 2.50/3 dollars for it and there would be more fillings. the ratio between carbs and fillings didn't match up."}
{"text":"The first time here I got a number two added some soy sauce with a drink. The price was great atmosphere was good and clean and friendly. 5/22/15 Second visit I tried the number 11 with sardines who would have thought but this place is good. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Finally a Vietnamese sandwich in Arizona. This place is still new and I only saw 2 people working. The wait wasn't bad. I ordered a #7 BBQ pork sandwich. It was good. I like the bread and the sandwich was perfect size. The price is not bad. Drink and sandwich for a cheap price. This is better than eating fast food joint. I would recommend this to a friend."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, very clean facilities, and the bread is out of this world good! (#2 is the best sandwich imo) Everyone who works there is very friendly, overall awesome place!"}
{"text":"This was my first at this Mekong sandwich the place was very nice and pleasing. The front cashier was very helpful and caring about what I want to order. The food was exceptional great especially the grill pork sandwich. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent bahn mi! I had the grilled beef, my husband had the special, and my 2 year old had the grilled chicken w/o jalapeño. Bread was toasty and crunchy on the outside, but soft and airy on the inside. Everything was nicely seasoned and proportioned. Also ordered the avocado boba and condensed milk iced coffee. Everything was delicious and the guy was really nice. Our new happy place."}
{"text":"This isn't exactly a \"fair\" interview.  And I really have a problem with people, who write reviews that have nothing to do with the business (like giving them 1 star because you came off hours and they were closed). But in this case, I think the following information is important for potential consumers to know:

 I didn't really get to try their sandwiches, because once you enter the place, there's sign in the corner -- not very obvious and nowhere mentioned on the door or window before entering -- stating it's a CASH ONLY business.  At $2.50 - $3.50 a sandwich --- and that's pretty much all they do --- I can understand why taking credit cards would be an issue  (most people don't know how expensive those transactions are for companies).  However, many businesses get around that by imposing a charge for transactions under, say, $10.  Or they won't take credit or debit cards under a certain total.  But to completely ban debit/credit cards in the 21st Century is not only anachronistic and inconvenient, it's unsafe for all involved (mainly the consumer, who now has to carry cash around).  Honestly, the last time I had actual cash in my pocket was when I was in Mexico earlier this year.  I can't remember the last time I've had US bills in my pocket while home.  It just doesn't pay to risk losing money or having it stolen.

For that reason, and that reason alone, I'm writing this review.  There ARE ATM machines nearby where you can withdraw cash; but since I'm not a customer of Chase Bank, I won't pay their fees to withdraw money plus a non-network ATM fee from Wells Fargo.  And I certainly won't use a non-affiliated, stand alone ATM machine in a mall.  Waaaay too risky.

Sorry, but I think it a bit unreasonable in this day and age to exclude customers based on a common payment method.  Being we were out here all the way from Goodyear, we easily would have bought enough to offset your fees and, if necessary, gladly would have paid a surcharge to use our cards and try your sandwiches."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches. #1 is delicious but I wish there was more cha lua."}
{"text":"I'm familiar with the authentic Banh Mi sandwiches sold in San Jose, so my standards are pretty high.  With that said, although the filling was pretty good at Mekond Sandwiches, I was very impressed by the in-house freshly baked baguettes used to contain the fillings of one's choosing.  If I could make one suggestion, if the bar-b-que meat was hot, and not lukewarm, the sandwich would be more delicious."}
{"text":"I'm going here again for lunch today. Maybe it's a good thing I don't live closer because I'd be in every day!
Don't leave without trying the #1"}
{"text":"Today, Emily, the nice young woman at the counter, encouraged me to try what she called her specialty - a smoothy drink- and also recommended their #2 sandwich. Both were very good. The #2 sandwich was very tasty! I am a creature of habit and usually order the same items, but I am so glad Emily introduced me to these 2 new things!"}
{"text":"Fresh bread, excellent service. 
We love the combination of vietnamese grilled meat and the pickled veggies and spicy jalapeño. 
For a hungry couple get 2 sandwiches each! We like the beef, pork, and jambon pate.
Bring cash- else you have to use the atm in the plaza. Sandwiches are super cheap $3.50 :-) for excellent quality!
I can't wait to try their cafe drinks too ...."}
{"text":"Amazing taste and quality food. They give great portions as well for such a small price. If you're stuck on what to get, try the #1 Mekong special. I tried it once and now it's the only one I ever order, so good!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Food was fresh and very friendly service. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a tasty meal to enjoy at any time during the day!"}
{"text":"I had high high hopes for this place. We ordered two different sandwiches -- the BBQ Pork and the Vietnamese Ham w/ Pate -- but the baguettes had a chewy exterior (supposed to be crispy outside and soft inside) with the ingredients in the sandwich leaving a bad after taste. I had to throw mine away but my husband forced himself to eat his as he does not like to waste food. I have since moved from Phoenix to Houston and will be on the hunt for better Banh Mi!"}
{"text":"The Bahn Mi is so good and they will make it very spicy if you like. I had the pulled pork one and it was excellent. I am glad to find a place since im from the east coast and it was easy in the city to find Vietnamese food there. One other thing, their thai tea has boa in it and I love it!! Have a taste also of the soup variation of the Bahn Mi its great. I go now every time I shop at Mekong Market."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Been a long time since I had a real Banh Mi. I had the special, jambon, and meatball and all were fantastic. Definitely going back soon"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Bahn Mi place. We had pork and sardine sandwiches, but they also have tofu for vegetarians. I can't say enough about how delicious the sandwiches are here. Fresh bread, not too crusty, a light smear of pate, pickled and fresh veggies plus your filling of choice. Too good!!  A sweet milk iced coffee makes the meal complete. Can't wait to return and try another kind of filling."}
{"text":"The best banh mi in AZ. I come here atleast once a week! :) and there customer service is great! They have a very fast service so you don't have to wait long."}
{"text":"Had the grilled pork banh mi and the Honeydew Smoothie. Both were bomb diggity!! Under $3.50 for that sandwich is a steal! Very clean and pleasant staff. Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"O-M-G! I love me some bahn mi and this place did not disappoint. We recently moved to Gilbert from San Diego, so I have been on a quest to find delicious Asian food here. I ordered the grilled chicken, my litmus test for bahn mi. Veggies were crunchy, bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, generous helping of chicken and lots of jalapenos. I pulled a few jalapenos off as I am a bit of a wuss when it comes to spicy, but still ate more than I would have expected because the whole sandwich just works so well the way that it is served. I took home extra loaves of bread for the family, too, at a few bucks for 4 loaves. Totally worth the drive!!"}
{"text":"So I got the #1, which was the original - along with a Thai tea with boba. I cannot even begin to tell you how perfect the bread was. Imagine the most perfect crunch every time you take a bite. And then - all the veggies! I'm not a huge veggie fan when it comes to sandwiches but I decided to trust my gut and go with the way it comes. Boy am I glad I did! The pickled carrots mixed with the cucumber and cilantro - along with the meat (which is simply an ingredient, not the focal point) - creates one of the best sandwich experiences you'll have. Even if you don't \"love\" one of the ingredients, get it the way it comes! I don't really like cilantro... but this sandwich wouldn't be good without it. I know that sounds odd but trust me. It creates a perfect harmony that may be interrupted if you leave one out. Enough rambling, back to eating!"}
{"text":"I've come to this place a few times and I've always thought of it as just another sandwich place... UNTIL I tried their grilled beef!!! Ugh sooooo goooooood. This is the best frigging place!!!! Try it out, you'll never want to leave!!"}
{"text":"On point! So far the best bahn mi joint i can find in  Phoenix.  The bread is perfect, fresh ingredients and delicious meats. I've had grilled chicken, pork, and beef.... All very tasty. As legit as you can get."}
{"text":"Solid Bahn Mi joint. Surprisingly low prices but definitely does not cut corners on taste! Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"My first time ever having a Vietnamese banh mi sandwich and wow, this stuff is good! First of all, friendly service. As for the food, the baguette bread is great--warm, crispy outside, soft inside, and the veggies are an exciting combination of savor and spice. I tried the Chinese-style BBQ Pork sandwich, the grilled beef and the vegetarian. All were delicious, but the BBQ pork was my favorite."}
{"text":"We were here from out of town because it is near the Banner Desert hospital and we were quite impressed with the #1 Mekong sandwich! We started out with two and ending up ordering 6 more to share with family and to eat for dinner later! They bake their bread fresh and with having the main meat and veggies, they add this other yellow sauce for flavor that just makes this sandwich the perfect quick bite! I commend them on their fresh baked bread because in Utah, I do not see that they do that! Best banh mi I've ever had, even compared to Lee's Sandwiches and to a little joint I like to go to in San Diego. Give this place a try, your taste buds will THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I enjoy their sandwiches very much and go back whenever I get a chance. I prefer their milk tea over other places in the mekong plaza. The employees are super friendly and you usually have your food in under 5 minutes. It's totally worth the wait if it takes a bit longer. Try one of the meat pastries if you have to sit for a bit."}
{"text":"Fabulous Ban Mi sandwiches!
I purchased 3 char siu or Chinese BBQ pork sandwiches on delicious on-site baked baguettes. Thinly sliced BBQ pork is coupled with pickled radish and carrots, cilantro, mayonnaise, cucumber and jalapeno is a winning combination for about $4 each. My only regret is not trying the lemongrass beef and the Mekong Special with head cheese.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Visited this place on Saturday after running around all afternoon. We had just visited my grandmother at a hospital in Mesa so I figured I'd stop by for a sandwich because I was having some major cravings for a banh mi. My fiance on the other hand, was not too happy that I wanted to stop at a sandwich shop 12 miles away from the hospital but \"happy wife, happy life\", right?

It was very quiet when we arrived but it was sometime after 2:30 p.m. and that's usually a very quiet time for restaurants anyway since it's between lunch and dinner. 

I went with the #3 grilled beef banh mi and my fiance went with #1 Mekong special. Probably waited 10 minutes for our sandwiches. I was pleasantly pleased with my sandwich but wished it had more pate on it. My fiance wasn't hungry so I saved his to eat the next day but he did say it surprisingly was good. 

We'll be back because we frequent Mekong Plaza but since we live in Scottsdale, it won't be that often."}
{"text":"This place is soooo much better than Lee's. I say that only because Lee's is pretty skimpy on the meat and Mekong does just the right amount. All the ingredients seem to be super fresh. The place is clean and the people there are nice. Some times it takes a while but I am willing to wait a few more minutes for a great sandwich. I still want to try their bo kho. Looks delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sandwiches anywhere. Try the #2...so good. I strongly recommend the #14...beef stew. Oh my goodness...!!!?"}
{"text":"Better than Lee's but they've got some work to do. They take way too long for a few sandwiches.  I asked if their che xoi nuoc (ginger dessert with mochi, mung bean balls) was hot and she told me yes, it was just made. Instead, it was cold and the coconut milk wouldn't dissolve! I don't like being lied to when it comes to food I order. Still, it was actually pretty good and I'd recommend it for some authentic Vietnamese che. The sandwich itself was ok. The bread seemed a little stale. Should be perfectly crispy on the outside, fluffy and chewy on the inside. They should probably toast the bread if it's been sitting out for a while.  Also, one of the guys working there was a little spastic. He kept calling out random sandwich orders when they were ready. The other lady had to tell him to read the receipts and labels before calling out orders? Weird. I'll come back to try a few more sandwiches and keep y'all posted."}
{"text":"This place is too good. Secretly it's the best place to buy baguettes in the valley. Past that the sandwiches are fire, and they have fair prices. 

The thing that throws them over the top are the slushes. Do I know what a slush is? 
No.
My passion fruit slush was great, and continues to be great every week. This place is great."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Tried it twice.  Got a special combo (my favorite at lees) and the first couple bites were delicious but the third bite was very... Strange.  Got scared and threw it out.  I had also ordered an iced coffee.  They only filled it up 3/4 of the way (???) and it was just okay.   Went back craving a pork pastry and was super excited because they were really big and First bite: fine.  Second bite: that weird taste again- almost like rotten meat.  I spit it out in my hand :( and threw out the rest.  I'm not saying that they serve old meat, maybe it's some weird spice that they use that I'm not used to, but I definitely learned my lesson and won't be returning.  Disappointing because I was so excited to have a banh mi place so close to me."}
{"text":"OK let's start with the one positive....yes they do bake their own banh mi so a fresh baked viet baguette which is always a plus in my book.  I observed that they make their sandwiches like that cheap ass frugal \"subway style\".  2 slices of head cheese and 2 slices of cha lua.  Little filla and NO thrilla!  So if you have a small appetite than it's perfect for you.  If your looking for a hearty banh mi....Mekong ain't going to cut the mustard or should I say pâté which they also charge for an extra shmear.  Right of course they do!  

They charge extra for even a few extra slivers of pickled carrots and daikon!  WTH is there is there like a shortage in AZ or something!  I have never ever been charged for extra pickled veggies on my banh mi ever!!!!!   

Overall it's a mediocre sandwich.  Given the limited options for banh mi in AZ.  It should take care of your bm fix and I'd return to try their bánh bao ONLY and the pate chaud ONLY when I'm back in the desert."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite spots in Mekong Plaza. So far I have tried two sandwiches here and they are quite good. The Grilled Chicken sandwich was really good and I enjoyed the lemongrass flavor. As for the BBQ Pork sandwich it was just okay, maybe I was just expecting more though. The people running the shop seem very friendly and there's plenty of seating inside. I like to come here for a quick meal and the prices are very reasonable for the sandwiches.

If you like Vietnamese sandwiches (Banh Mi) definitely give this place a try. I was born and raised in California and the sandwiches here rival some that I have had in San Jose."}
{"text":"One of the best Banh Mi place coming from a Vietnamese, the price is reasonable and I love their hours since they open early I can get breakfast early, the bread is always fresh crispy on the out side but soft on the inside perfect texture."}
{"text":"Great place we found on Yelp.  We are so glad to have found this sandwich specialty shop.  It's in a plaza with other Vietnamese shops that I will check out, as well. The store is clean, modern, and the staff is very friendly!!!"}
{"text":"In front of the immaculate Mekong Plaza (think Asian mall) is this awesome sandwich place. The bread is fresh and delicious. The sandwiches are better than most other sub shops probably because of the bread. Traditional Vietnamese Bahn Mi those sandwiches and American favorites too for those who want something normal (with amazing bread). My favorite is the #1 pork belly, a sliced steamed bun, French pâté and maybe six other ingredients. I haven't tried them but it seems really popular for treats like smoothies, slushies, and Vietnamese coffee. Then work it off walking around the trinket shop in Mekong Plaza."}
{"text":"I know the owner way before he opened this business, and I'm so glad that he finally operated a Banh Mi location where only 7mins away from ASU Tempe. Now they even offer American style sandwiches, adding on to the awesomeness that this place already had. I will try the American sandwiches later, but for now Im still sticking with my oriental instinct. 

The bread is so crunchy but soft, along with the variety of side choices. You can choose from grilled chicken to jambon combo and everything is just perfect. I love how they are being concerned about putting veggies and onion garnish on the side when you decide to order togo. Great choice! That way I won't have to accidentally cook the fresh stuff when reheating. 

Also, when you are in a rush you can always call in to place an order first prior to picking up. I have tried so far nearly the whole menu, but not yet the drink options since the store next door already stole my heart for their bomb boba :) I did try Che Thai from their dessert offers, but the portion was too much I could not finish it. I guess I should only keep up with the sandwiches. 5 stars for sanwiches, 4.5 stars for dessert portion."}
{"text":"This place replaces Lee's sandwiches as the best banh minh in my opinion. Its banh mi are soft and crunchy unlike Lee's sandwiches nowadays that are harder to bite. 
Often, when you come early in the morning, they have a day old banh mi left over from the day before and sell for a cheaper price. I would usually buy these one day old as a saving stock when I make curry or beef stew to dip in. 
I personally like the grilled beef banh mi (banh mi thit nuong) over other variety because it has a Vietnamese texture to the meat. It consists of grilled beef, cilantro, green chile, cucumber, pickled carrot and radish, paté, buttered mayonnaise, and of course, the freshly baked baguette. 
The price is not bad and so much better than those from Subways. I totally recommend this place. I have been a loyal customer after being disappointed from Lee's sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is good. Inexpensive, good quality and fresh food. I do recommend that they put more toppings on some of their sandwiches because once and a while they would skim out on my sandwich."}
{"text":"For a Vietnamese sandwich place in AZ, they deserve 5 stars.  The place is clean and the lady in front is super nice despite being swamped and running around like crazy. Their banh mi's are delicious and the baguette is fresh and perfectly masters the crunch on outside soft on inside concept.  The bread dissolves as you bite into it.  Like most banh mi's the combo of all the main flavors and textures together make it amazing - salty meat of choice, sweet and sour pickled carrots, crunchy cucumber and cilantro, must-have pate, and fresh jalapeños give it the final kick. Beet part is they only cost $4!  Been here a few times but never tried their sides. Will have to try them next time especially the sticky rice and meat pastry."}
{"text":"Best French Bread ever & best Banh Mi! My family owns a Vietnamese/French restaurant for over 35 years in St. Paul, MN & makes the best Banh Mi in town but when I tried Mekong's, I seriously was in heaven!!! I always stop here after getting off the plane before heading home to Sun City!!!"}
{"text":"Drive past every sandwich shop you regularly visit and head sraight to Mekong Sandwiches. You will not be disapointed. You will also keep coming back for more, more, and more!"}
{"text":"Very nice service to pick up a boba drink to go.  Unfortunately the boba was dry in the middle."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The owner is very friendly, always smiling. They offer banh mi sandwiches, American subs, spring rolls, meat pies, as well as smoothies, boba tea, and Vietnamese coffee. I haven't had the American subs but everything else is delicious! Many choices of sandwiches from egg, stew, BBQ pork, grilled beef, meatballs, ect. The baguettes are freshly made in store; soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. Cheap, fast, delicious food."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm even close to this amazing place, I stop in for a #1 Special Banh Mi to go. I always eat most of it right there, with extra sriracha & nuoc cham (mandatory!). Even as I'm walking out, I want more, and on the way home, I berate myself for not buying many more #1's to go! The #1 is so good, that I haven't even tried the many other versions. At $4.15, you CANNOT go wrong!"}
{"text":"I love there sandwiches and the staff is nice but damn people clean your restaurant tabletops aren't bad the table base and floors filthy windows and trim need a good cleaning as well ."}
{"text":"Owner acknowledged and apologized. Great customer service! The random closures won't happen anymore- was family issues."}
{"text":"I really like their sandwiches, actually crave them. Sometimes I drive 30 - 40 minutes just to go there. The bread is amazing, very similar to German rolls. I had sandwiched from other Asian sandwich places but you will find the best ones here. My Favorite: Grilled Pork with extra meat."}
{"text":"We tried this place after remembering that this new sandwich shop had opened.  We are glad that a Vietnamese sandwich shop is now closer to home.  The other reviews said they had a long wait so I was expecting it,  but there was no wait at all.  Maybe 2 minutes at the most.  That was a pleasant surprise.  We were the only ones there also. 

I had the sliced pork sandwich. #7.  I liked the way the meat was seasoned.  The veggies tasted fresh.

Wife had the Mekong special.  #11. We tried each other's sandwich. She liked hers better and I like mine better.  The difference between us is I like to taste the meat in the sandwich I eat.  She is happy with tasting veggies. 

I would definitely come here again and recommend it."}
{"text":"Totally obsessed with the place. We usually get at #1 or #2 with a Taro boba . Emily is amazingly sweet and always greets me. The staff is great and the sandwiches are fresh! And the bread is sinful. I go weekly"}
{"text":"So happy to have Mekong Sandwiches close to where I shop once a week. Best bahn mi and iced Vietnamese coffee ever. Aloha!"}
{"text":"Make sure you ask what comes on your sandwich.  The menu board doesn't accurately describe the contents. Gentleman was less than helpful claiming if I didn't want the ingredient that I didn't know was on my sandwich I should have told him. First issue here. The American sandwiches are great."}
{"text":"WOW, excellent bahn mi! This is literally the best bahn mi I have ever tasted.  The bread is the absolute perfect light, crispy texture and the pate, pork, and filling is perfectly seasoned and proportioned.  I wish they had a location in Tucson because I was thinking about this sandwich for days. 

It saddens me to dock a star for their extremely filthy dining area. There was trash, crumbs, used napkins all over the floor and tables. They were also completely out of all their bubble tea flavors when I went."}
{"text":"I admit that I am a newbie to Vietnamese food. Heck, I've just finally adjusted to the spiciness of Mexican and Cajun food and just dipped my toes into the heat of Thai food, so it was with trepidation that I ventured into this shop next to the place where I had just had a Thai massage. 

I had the special of the day--beef stew ($4.10). It included a fresh baked French roll that was the size of an eight inch hoagie roll. Hallelujah! Come for these rolls if nothing else. The best French bread ever! You can buy just the rolls 5/$2.00! 

How about the beef stew? Well, there was 1 carrot the size of a golf ball and one potato the size of a golf ball on steroids. They were tender enough that my plastic spoon sliced through them OK. The beef was a large knot of beef, cartilage and collagen. I pulled the tender, flavorful beef off of the knot with my fingers. If the meat and veggies has been in bite sized pieces (and minus the knot of cartilage) this would have been a 5 star review. The broth was a huge departure from any American beef stew I have ever had. It was a thin, spicy broth--not a thick gravy. How spicy? My lips were tingling--but not numb. So I guess the spice level was just right for me. 

The store is very clean. Only tables and chairs for seating. The staff was very friendly and the person waiting on me had excellent English skills. Parking is close to the door. I plan on returning to try the Vietnamese grilled chicken breast sandwich ($3.60) or maybe the American ham, turkey, and Swiss sandwich ($4.95). I am also intrigued by the puff pastry meat pies (3/$5)."}
{"text":"Delicious 'til the final bite! The bread here is exactly what sandwich bread should be: fresh baked and fully supportive yet soft enough for a massive bite. My grilled chicken/lemongrass Bánh Mi Gà Nuóng was flavored just right. The pickled carrots, radish, cucumber, cilantro, and jalapeños were a perfect compliment to the chicken within the sandwich. I had the honeydew boba and it was a bit sweet for me...tho brother liked it just fine! Super happy after this meal!"}
{"text":"growing up in Perth Australia I have had my fair share of banh mi. I had the grilled pork and shredded pork with pork skins and it wasn't bad but I had banh mi thit (crispy pork belly) in the past and seems nothing can compare to that.  I just found the grilled pork to be too sweet and the shredded pork to have no flavor.  Might return but maybe I might just not have banh mi till I go back to perth"}
{"text":"This is my first FIVE STAR and I was kinda hesitant. It was my first time here, being the judgmental type I am I couldn't find nothing wrong with the place. Service was nice and fast. Price was cheap and accepted plastic. The #5 grilled chicken with lemongrass spread was delicious! Chicken was actually marinated and spread was sweet and tasty. The bread is what made me fall in love, it was so soft! If you have eaten Vietnamese sandwiches the bread is so hard it cuts your pilate; not here! Viet Coffee was amazing! I suggest this place."}
{"text":"I love the Banh Gio (Vietnamese Rice and Pork Pyramid Dumplings) here.  It tastes so wholesome and fresh.  Best in town.  But you have to get here early on Saturday mornings to get it because it sells out so fast.

Their Goi Du Du (Green Papaya Salad) is pretty good too.

Nem (fermented pork) here is very good as well.

Update: Good News!! It looks like Banh Gio is available throughout the week now."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches! We had the #1, complete with head cheese, pork belly, etc. and everything was perfect - the bread was just as it should be (light crunchy crust, soft, rich, fluffy center), lots of crisp veggies, and great mixture of meats. 

Place is no frills, dirt cheap, and the food is great! 

My biggest issue is, I can't hardly resist going for the dim sum or the Pho at all the other great places in the plaza."}
{"text":"I love me a good Bahn Mi Sandwich and I'm glad I found a new place to satisfy my sandwich cravings. If you like Lee's sandwich you'll love this place even better. Prices are around $4 for the sandwich and you can choose to make it a combo which includes a drink & 10% discount. You can choose boba milk tea, smoothies or soda with your combo meal.
I ordered the Mekong Special #1 which included ham, steamed pork, pate, pork belly and head cheese. I absolutely devoured my sandwich! The bread is made fresh and I loved that it was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  That made eating my sandwich more enjoyable because the sandwiches as Lee's always hurt the roof of my mouth because the bread was to hard. I also appreciate that they stuff the sandwich with more meat and pickled vegetables! Overall the service was good, the food came out fast and the food tastes great :) Also they accept cards which I appreciate since I never carry cash with me!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem I can't believe there are only 36 reviews of this place to date!  I ordered a grilled pork banh mi and it was delicious--perfect, really.  The bread (baked fresh on premises) was crusty and soft, the grilled meat flavorful, the vegetables crisp and sweet and tart, and the sauce yummy.  The customer service was great and the restaurant was bright and clean.  I can't wait to go back.  I will be craving those sandwiches until I return."}
{"text":"Wow! I have seen this place around these past few weeks and finally got around to trying this place. I got the Bo Nuong (grilled beef sandwich) and to my surprise, this was the best sandwich I have ever put in my mouth. The beef was perfectly cooked with the right amount of seasoning and lemongrass. The bread was crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I advise anyone who is in the Mekong shopping center to visit this place when hungry."}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast, the wait time is kinda long. freshly baked bread and clean kitchen! thats what I'm looking for when I go into an Asian restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm disappointed in this place.  My Banh Mi was anything but decent.  With a bread baking machine that looks like a time machine you'd think this place would blow your mind.  

Sigh!  In the end, I feel like their Banh Mi is very new school.  Doesn't have that strong pungent smell like most Vietnamese sandwiches.  The taste was pretty plain since there wasn't a lot of protein.  I got a lot of the pickled carrots and fresh cilantro, but that's about it.  The bread was decent at best.  My Vietnamese coffee was okay, but very small portions.  

In the end, I'm sad to say I wasn't impressed even though I had high hopes for this place.  I'll give it another run when I'm in need of Banh Mi or coffee. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Easily became one of my favorites. Faster service than before. Great staff. Clean and casual atmosphere. If you want something cheap, fast and tasty - this is the spot. I personally like the Jambon and their Pate so. I have yet to try their other sandwiches. It's hard to venture out when you find your favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm an International student and back then I was in my country, I ate a lot of good Sandwiches. The sandwiches over here are authentic, delivious and very affordable. I'm glad that I found a place like this. Feel like in Vietnam. Should give it a try. I got the number 10, the grilled beef with lemon grass. Very good
Bring cash because they have had the credit card system"}
{"text":"Freshly baked Vietnamese baguettes, the foundation for a fantastic sandwich.  Fill it with bbq pork, ham, pork belly, with pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, onions, and a sweet mayonnaise dressing, and on that tender chewy bread becomes something even more amazing!  At $4 this is such a great option.

My favorite is the #1, also really liked the #10 and the #6.  I also like to grab a couple extra loaves of bread to take home. they're that good."}
{"text":"Very good Ban Mi, although the selection is somewhat limited. There's always a varied assortment of sides and desserts to make up for that though. 

Very friendly staff even when language is a bit of a barrier. 

Highly recommend... Even the Sardine sandwich is good!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best banh mi sandwich I've ever had! I could live off the freshly baked bread alone...like a fluffy, crunchy cloud.  I had the number 2 and now wish I had ordered two more.  Friendly, helpful service, clean bathroom..all around A+!"}
{"text":"Make sure to call before driving the distance. Apparently they close earlier than stated sometimes. We got here at 7:05 (closing tome said 7:30pm) and they were \"open\" but kitchen was closed. Considering the long drive it took to get here, it was super disappointing. Always call!"}
{"text":"Mekong Sandwiches is one of those little gems that you can only hope to find a few times while hunting for food. The inside of the place smells delicious, like freshly baked bread and freshly cooked meat. The menu is simple but terrific, you can't go wrong with any of the options. Personally I love the pork and beef bahn mi and beef stew. One of the best parts about this place however is the staff. The lady who I've seen behind the counter the most often is incredibly sweet. One time she gave my parents and I a small bowl of stew to try free of charge!! So if you're looking for reasonably priced delicious food I'd come here for sure!"}
{"text":"I would be giving them 5 stars but they won't serve \"American\" (their term not mine) sandwiches anymore. Now I have to go elsewhere for my husband. That makes me sad. I love the picked veggies and their meat is delicious. But they need to be flexible. Ham, turkey, roast beef, and cheese in America is expected at a sandwich shop; every sandwich shop. They use to serve it."}
{"text":"Far superior to Subway plus it's owned by a sweet Vietnamese family who take pride in their business. Sandwiches are always consistently great. And the baguettes are so tasty!  They even remember what we order every time!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, never had a Vietnamese sandwhich before. I would go to American sandwhich spots, man this was a big surprise. Carrots... Really on a sandwhich. Let me tell you, it works. I was really surprise, all the flavors on my first bite was really good, fresh baked bread and ingredients. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place as first time try out beef BBQ sandwich. My daughter ordered pork BBQ. Both are good. Thank you \"Vy\" the nice cashier girl recommended us the best choIce. Really Nice Service"}
{"text":"Was looking for a Vietnamese food delivery on Postmates when I ran across this place. It's hard to find one that also has sandwiches that serve what was my first love with head cheese and pate on the perfect bread. This restaurant does a pretty good job. Also, since it was delivery, I appreciated the vegetables were not on the sandwich but in a separate little baggie. Delicious."}
{"text":"Super legit banh mi sandwiches. I missed the banh mi from back in LA. This really hit the mark. I was super surprised that it tasted so good. I was reminded of the sandwiches from LA when I took the first bite. The cafe sua da was really tasty as well. AND the prices were pretty similar to ones back in LA, not too expensive. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Hands down the best banh mi IMO, and I've had a lot of them.  The freshly baked bread is outstanding, the perfect touch.  The only disappointment....I live too far away to get over here more.  Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"I'm rather disappointed with my latest visit. I got two different sandwiches--the grilled chicken and the BBQ pork--but honestly, I probably wouldn't have known which was which without the sticker on the wrapper. I was immediately skeptical because of how light each of the sandwiches felt when I took them out of the bag. And the reason for that became immediately apparent: There was hardly any meat on either sandwich, and what little meat there was appeared to be deli meat. That's OK if I'm going to Subway, but I have different expectations for banh mi.

That said, the service has been friendly and quick both times I've been here. The bread is nice, fresh, and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The vegetables are all fresh. The restaurant is clean.

I had high hopes for this place. I think this was my last visit."}
{"text":"Greeted as I walked in.  Reviewed the menu and choose #5 Chicken Banh Mi.  Service is quick and staff are pleasant.  The bread is crisp and ingredients fresh.  The ingredients are the typical of choice of meat, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro and jalapeños.  I would have liked a few more of those pickled veggies but all in all it was a good sandwich.  The price is very reasonable. The place is very clean and there are several tables to eat at. Staff are very grateful that you come in.

Back at Mekong Plaza for some shopping.  Stopped for a Bánh mì sandwich.  I wanted #5 chicken Bánh mì and they were out of chicken.  Bummer.  Got # 9, the vegetarian which consists of pickled carrots, cucumber, fried tofu, fried yam and cilantro.  Quite yummy and quick service.  The bread was crunchy yet soft on the inside.  Plenty of parking available.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I'm from Dallas, TX and we have some pretty great hole-in-the-wall banh mi joints there. I've visited Phoenix a couple times and Mekong Sandwiches probably has the BEST banh mi in the entire Phoenix area. I like to think of myself as a banh mi aficionado and usually no banh mi places from anywhere I visit out-of-town compares to back home but Mekong comes pretty darn close. 

It took a little less than 10 minutes to get our sandwiches and they even apologized which was honestly no big deal because that's not a long wait time at all. Their reasoning as to why it took \"so long\" was because the bread was not finished baking yet...which is a great reason to me! The great thing about Mekong is they bake their own bread and it just tastes so fresh! I ordered this to-go and ate it 4 hours later and I could STILL taste the freshness. I love the pate, buttery mayo, pickled vegetables, and the meats. There was a great balance of everything. Crunchy, sweet, savory, spicy...everything tasted wonderful. Great prices, too!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali so I'm quite the picky person about Vietnamese food, but this place definitely exceeded my expectations! I like it wayyyyy better than lees sandwich. Their bread isn't as hard and painful to bite. It's softer. Now some people might not like that because they prefer crunchy, but I always pop mine in the oven first because I like it warm. So voila problem solved and I've got a perfect crunchy soft banh mi ^__^ also they put a good amount of pate and butter, which lees doesn't do. And the amount of pickled veggies is perfect. They'll ask if you want it on the side and if you do they put it in a tiny ziploc bag for each individual banh mi. Which is nice when you want to order like 10 for your coworkers, they can each add in their own veggies without everyone coming in and out of the same ziploc. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Oh yum, yum, yum, yum, yum..  This is the best sandwich spot in Mesa!  The sandwiches and food here are to die for.  I went in a few days ago as a first time customer and the guy up front was super friendly and advised me on what was his favorite, which I promptly ordered.  The pork meatball sandwich was a perfect combination of spicy with a hint of sweet and yummy crunchy veggies.  I would definitely recommend ordering with extra veggies though because I personally feel like they make the sandwiches even better.  I've since come here a couple more times this week and have had a different meal each time.  Every time the service was friendly and fast and the food is simply delicious.  Definitely give this place a try.  You won't regret it!  Perfect on price and outstanding taste!"}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here minus the pate. I'm not a huge pate fan. The bread is the best way better than Lee's but the only down side is they are not open on Wednesday's."}
{"text":"Can't believe I didn't start eating here sooner! The sandwiches are bomb. You can order 2 for about less than $10. Come here if you want something quick and filling."}
{"text":"Best Bahn mi I have ever had in the states! The bread is so soft and crispy outside. I had number 2 and it was so yummy. The store is very big, quiet and clean, and the service was good. I also bought 2 baguettes and made sandwiches at home and it was fantastic. Baguette is $0.90."}
{"text":"The most affordable & flavorful food, and paired with friendly fast service and many menu options. Go for the #1 if you want to try a more traditional Vietnamese sandwich (Dac Biet) or if you want a really delicious marinated beef sandwich go for the #3. They're plenty of options. Their fresh baguette bread is to die for. Their coffee is also my absolute favorite in the valley. At $7.30 for a combo with a drink you can't beat Mekong Sandwiches for a quick lunch Togo."}
{"text":"You need to try the #1, it's amazing!  Make it a combo w/ the Honeydew Smoothie, add Boba."}
{"text":"Happy to have found a place outside of LA  for good Vietnamese sandwiches.  Bread is baked on site so it's fresh and tasty.  They are slightly smaller than we are used to, but you can't beat the price.  Only one sandwich is more than $4.  They also have smoothies, iced coffee, and flavored teas.  Sticky rice, puff pastries with meat and other treats round out the menu."}
{"text":"The bread is great. It's crispy in the outside and really fresh tasting. Great value. And it's right if the light rail."}
{"text":"I love banh mis and this place has the best ones I've had in Phoenix.
Service:
Fast
Some staff members aren't fluent English speakers but it's never been a problem for me. I've never had any wrong orders... even the difficult ones

Ambience: 
Very clean restaurant
TVs

Food: 
AWESOME.
The bread is super soft, but chewy on the outside and always freshly baked
The vegetables are incredibly fresh and there's a perfect amount of everything
Pate comes on pretty much all the sandwiches-I'm not the biggest fan but it's really good as far as pate goes
Meat: My favorite is the grilled pork and grilled chicken. Both are full of flavor and moist. I've found the barbecued pork to be dry (Char siu), the meatballs are mushy but I like the flavor, and the steak is a little bit chewy. That really is my only complaint... 

Drink: The avocado and taro smoothies are the absolute best I've ever had! And I've had every single boba drink on Dobson...

Price: The sandwiches are great deals. They run around $3.75 each. Which is amazing. Combos come with a smoothie or tea and are around 6-7$. I wish that the drinks alone were a tad cheaper (around $4) but I can't really complain because they're so good. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place. It's not perfect, but they're going to have the best banh mis and sandwiches in Mesa and Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are excellent here. Prices were raised slightly higher than what I had previously seen, but still a great deal. We got the #2 and #3. Both meats had tons of flavor and were great. I really liked the meat to veggie ratio - we could taste everything together and the sandwich wasn't overpowered by a single flavor. Bread was nice and fresh."}
{"text":"I specially love the Bánh Mì ?c Bit here. I have it like once everyweek. The bread is crispy and the combination of meat, butter and pate' is very tasty."}
{"text":"Best banh mi's in the east valley! Love walking in and smelling freshly baked bread. The ingredients are also fresh and the employees of the store are so pleasant. If you want to custom a sandwich to your liking, they are very helpful. Wish this was much closer to our house!"}
{"text":"I rarely do five stars but this place made me happy Super close to my work and great prices Inside is clean and modern And the bahn sandwiches are fresh and tasty Pickled goodness with Vietnamese meat on a fresh French roll And only four bucks for a 12in sandwich !"}
{"text":"Since my first experience, I've gone back 3 times. There is definitely a lack of turn-around time regarding the point of ordering and receiving your good. 
The place gets a few large orders, and if you are the unlucky one who gets stuck behind those orders, it is a test of patience. I still believe they need to improve their process regarding high order times. It is simply unacceptable..."}
{"text":"Stroll into this shop one morning waiting for Mekong Supermarket to open. The cashier was friendly and service was prompt. I order the #4 Pork Meatball and it was fabulous.  The sandwich itself is $3.85 and the meat was very tender and the bread was fresh.  Although they cost a bit more than Lee's Sandwiches, I would pay to eat better quality food, not to mention, they take credit cards unlike Lee's Sandwiches."}
{"text":"I first discovered bahn mi in Nebraska of all places. I was hooked from the first bite.  Since moving to Mesa last December I have been looking for a place that scratches the bahn mi itch. I've found the place.  Bread crisp crust and tender middle? Check.  Pickled veggies crunchy and flavorful? Check. Grilled meats seasoned and tender? Check. 
Under 5.00 for a huge sandwich? Not quite.  Slightly underfilled but just order extra fillings and be happy. I am every bite of every sandwich!"}
{"text":"I liked this place okay. Decent banh mi, pate chaud and ca phe sua da. The banh mi was flavorful, and the bread was nice. They put red onions in the banh mi, which was new for me but not a deal breaker. These banh mis were also a great size, so they run for a little more than the usual price. The pate chaud was flavorful as well, I wish it was a little more wet inside, usually the juice seeps through the inside of the pastry which is where the best flavor is. It was good though. Ca phe sua da was good. Just sweet enough and just strong enough. 

I would go back. The owner was really nice too. Definitely, worth a try."}
{"text":"Simply put, the food is outstanding. Sandwiches to die for on some amazing bread. I haven't had sandwich bread this good since I was in Europe last year. They make everything fresh. On the way to work today I grabbed 6 Puff Pastries. So flaky they were unreal. No I didn't eat them all.
I've had sandwiched there and some deserts. A few things look odd but try them. Things here are not what they seem and it's all delicious. The smoothies are so good. My treat today after having a tooth pulled. 
$3.75 for a sandwich and $7.50 for the combo. Amazing prices."}
{"text":"Very tasty sandwich (I had the grilled pork), it was fantastic. Incredible favors - foodie approved!
Fast and friendly service. Clean and spacious restaurant.
... And the kicker ... This 8\" sandwich cost less than a 6\" sub!!"}
{"text":"This is the best banh mi I've had in Arizona. Eating at Lee's pales in comparison to Mekong Sandwiches. Prices are so reasonable, they offer credit card, and the quality is so much higher.

The sandwiches hover below the $4 range, with an option to make it a combo meal which includes a drink for a 10% discount. I went with the #1 Mekong special. It included pork belly, ham, steamed pork, head cheese, and pate. It was absolutely delicious. The bread was freshly baked and had a light crisp crunch with a perfectly soft inner surface. The meats were flavorful and more plentiful than in a Lee's sandwich. I also tried the #3 grilled beef sandwich which had a flavorful marinade and was full of beef and vegetables.

Service was fast and friendly at the counter. There is a case of various Vietnamese goodies such as pate chaud and bamboo leaf wrapped sticky rice.

I also had an iced green milk tea which was overall refreshing but had a bit of a floral aftertaste which was weird to me.

So, if you're craving a sandwich you're can't go wrong with the sandwiches here."}
{"text":"Having recently moved from California and access to authentic Viet food in Little Saigon I was very pleasantly surprised to find this place. Ironically, my wife and I didn't order a sandwich. We went with one of our favorite dishes, bo kho (beef stew). It was spot on. The broth  was full of flavor, the beef was soft and tender, and the baguette was absolutely perfect. Baked fresh on the premises, the inside of the bread was soft and airy with a delicate crunch on the outside. Only issue is they skimp on the meat, so I don't recommend sharing like we did. When it's this good, get your own!"}
{"text":"Mekong Sandwiches makes their bread in house and fresh throughout the day. The taste of fresh, warm bread is evident. Overall, this place makes good sandwiches, but are slightly skimpy on the meats. Good place for a satisfying and cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place. I almost go there every other day. Unlike Bao said, I love their #1 Banh Mi. Maybe because I only have Lee's sandwich to compare with, which I think this place is waaay better then Lee's. I always order #1 and no bake (the bread is softer). Tried some other ones, still like #1 the best. 
I have bought these sandwiches to my friends and let them try it. They all got addicted to it like I do. Lol.
The only thing I wish they can change: they close at 7pm and 6pm on Mondays~Which means I can't have my #1 Banh Mi for dinner most of the time... sad..."}
{"text":"I judge bahn mi from BBQ pork and this place has the best I've found in the valley. Homemade bread /3.50$! Friggin right, I ate 3 in a row the other day and it was great and I'd do it again."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese sandwich with fresh baked bread that's crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Plenty of meat and flavors. Fast and amazing price. So much better than lee let's sandwich. I could have one everyday."}
{"text":"Great costumers service! As well as fast service! Deffinetly will return here again in the near future!"}
{"text":"We tried Mekong Sandwiches for the first time yesterday, and overall, I thought it was okay.  The prices were reasonable, and our customer service was friendly and fast.  The \"dining area\" (very few chairs or dine-in customers) and kitchen were clean.  However, I felt that the baguette could have been crispier.  The joy of the Vietnamese \"banh mi\" is the baguette, which should be crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  And I missed the wonderful bread aroma that usually greets you when you walk into any place serving fresh baguettes.  Also, we could have used a little bit more substance in the sandwiches, although the baguettes were a decent size.  I think since they are new and still adjusting to things, I would definitely come back and give them another chance.  But as it is, I would classify Mekong Sandwiches as average - I would eat here but probably wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my FAVORITE PLACES IN PHOENIX.  If you ever want a fresh sandwich,  this is the place to go.  Their freshly made bread is second to none! I love the great combination of ingredients in their sandwiches. 
In addition, Mekong has one of the BEST Boba Teas.  The light and fresh sandwich makes me feel less guilty when adding a fried spring roll and a Honey Dew Boba Milk tea to my meal. 
I feel no shame in coming here weekly to get my"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Had the #2 grilled pork. I'm in love. The fresh bread, grilled pork, wonderful sauce and the fresh crunchy vegetables. I'm a very big fan of Vietnamese iced coffee with the sweetened condensed milk. This place stood above so many others. I knew something was different so I asked, they use a hazelnut flavored coffee. What a difference. That was good iced coffee. I only come out this way maybe once a month for work but I'm going to remember this place from now on"}
{"text":"Never tried Banh Mi before coming here. I didn't know you could even reinvent the sandwich in such a way. You can't beat the price or the taste. Different layers of texture and flavor in a freshly baked baguette. I drive all the way from Scottsdale and order four at a time, 2 for me and 2 for my boyfriend"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese sandwich in Phoenix! The bread is fresh bake & stay hot. I had the number 1 on the menu & it wasn't disappoint me. This one is better than Lee Sandwich!"}
{"text":"Maybe over time I've eaten maybe a hundred of these sandwiches in different places by now. There are some great ones here.
There Mekong special banh mi is just that.  Delicious. 
Baking there own baguettes...that's special.
It's clean, there friendly and quick.
Never had a bad anything here. 
So why just 4 stars...nothing that they did. It's my hope of walking into heaven and having a Mekong Sandwich there.
Last words...pate, yes please."}
{"text":"I was expecting a normal experience.. You know, nothing super amazing cause I always compare it back to Cali. Not to be repetitive about my California roots but it's important when I judge Asian food.  Being from San Gabriel Valley I can certainly say I have had my fair share of banh mi sandwiches (there's one on every block down valley). My family loved to get them for everything from simple Saturday lunches to day long amusement park trips (Disneyland, yes we were the Asians that snuck banh mi in.. No shame :)). Ok sorry for the trip down memory lane. On to the food! My boyfriend got Op La (#1 with two over easy eggs, not on menu) this is his childhood favorite.. The excitement I saw on his face after he ordered and they actually knew what he was talking about. So as he sunk his teeth into the bread I can see his face light up ... Picture the scene from Ratatouille when Ego takes the bite into the dish and it flashes back into his childhood.. Yep! Cue same scene but replace with my boyfriend and his banh mi. He said \"omgosh I have never had such good Op La!!\" I didn't have as dramatic of a first bite but my taste buds were sure screaming of joy. I got the cold cut which is my personal favorite. It was verryyyy good. Their pâté yum! I don't want to over hype this place for you now... But I am definitely a banh mi veteran from my time in California. Good meat and the bread was crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside. This is definitely going to be our go to banh mi place. 

Tips: try adding an egg to your sandwich and try eating there instead of to go..keeps bread crunchy! 

My happy tummy says we will be back !"}
{"text":"The first time I came here the experience was very meh with a BBQ pork sandwich (Banh Mi Xa Xiu) that was in reality just a gamy porky mess with no char. It may also been because I waited 30 min to eat it but the sandwiches bread didn't really hold up to standards as well.

I normally wouldn't have came back but they sent out these great coupons that lured me back to try their other sandwiches. This time I vowed not to go cheap and paid the .25 cents more for the Grilled Pork Banh Mi. (Thit Nuong) This one was way better! Bread was fresh and crunchy, pork was juicy and with nice grill marks it was a winner. 

If pork isn't too your liking you can also get the grilled beef as these two tasted the best out of the three I tried. It tastes a little bit like Korean bbq sandwich in a way with nice greens and that butter mayo pate~"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised coming here and finding Banh Bao Chien Gion! It was warm, soft and just fried goodness!!! I believe it's pork, egg and sausage, in a Bao that's fried. Somehow it retains all the original flavor and is transformed to have better taste. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This place is now slightly better than Lee's Sandwiches, maybe just a tiny bit more expensive.  It's a solid sandwich, not the best banh mi that I've had, or the worst.  I typically use the grilled pork for my point of comparison for banh mi.  The pork here is fine, a little less fatty than Lee's, and the bread is crisp enough on the outside, decent tasting enough for bread.  Though the meat was better than Lee's, there was a distinct lack of pickled veggies.

I know banh mi isn't about overstuffing the sandwich, but just like Lee's, you get the sense that there's a distinct imbalance between the amount of bread and filling.

That being said, it's a cheap meal.  I would come back if I'm at Mekong Plaza and looking for something quick, and in the mood for a sandwich.  Tough competition with the food inside."}
{"text":"Great find in Mekong Plaza. Vietnam sandwiches on freshly baked baguettes. Very fast service and restaurant is bright and clean.  I had the #1 Mekong Special with pork and head cheese. hubby had #3 grilled Beef. Split both and was very satisfying. 

The combo includes a drink and you can choose from smoothie or boba ice tea or hot coffee.

Very affordable and good. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The good: Truly excellent flavors, very quick prep times, and a wonderful sense of freshness to the various options on the menu. The meat pastries are an excellent addition to a meal and the prices on milk teas are impressively competitive. Their sandwich & drink combo is a very solid value.

The bad: Very limited options if you're a vegetarian and the vast majority of the menu is beef or pork, with a single chicken option. I have to stress though, everything the do offer is high quality. 

The ugly: The dining area is pretty simple and utilitarian. Clean but not really a place for a date."}
{"text":"I had the #1 and I would say this is a safe bet for anyone trying banh mi for the first time. It's what comes to mind when someone asks me what a banh mi is. Crunchy but soft bread, pickled veggies, pâté, pork and cilantro. 

This place bakes their own bread fresh daily. Their sandwiches are simple but good. I'm giving this place 5 stars because they are good... not WONDERFUL, but they are consistent, quick and does the job for fulfilling a banh mi craving. 

They have a few tables and chairs set up like a casual deli would, but nothing fancy here. I usually order to go, so haven't ran into any problems with the dining area."}
{"text":"STK Ninjas! Quick bite before the night, and it was OH so right.
Drew senbon against my little ninja sister on this one.  Don't worry, Papa Ninja was the judge.

Chicken Lemongrass Banh Mi GA Nuong (So Meaty)
Sis says hers was better.

BBQ Pork, Banh mi xa xiu (Winner, winner, non-chicken dinner)
I says mine was better.

Pate Chaud ( Delish)
Little pork treasures with edible dough tips.  

Great coffee, smells like fresh baked bread upon entry, super clean and quiet and friendly staff.  Components that chalk up this great little shop.  Try out both Banh Mi and see which you think is the better.

There is also a vegetarian Banh Mi consisting of Tofu, Yam and pickled carrots, also amazing.  With that bread, it has savory, sweet, tang, squish and a slew of words that are sounds.

5 Ninja Stars, and Papa Ninja reluctantly agreed mine was the better!  Sorry sis!

{"text":"Best bahn mi in the valley! The staff is super nice and the service is fast. Yummy boba teas too."}
{"text":"Mekong Sandwiches is the perfect place for a quick bite to eat. My favorite thing about this shop is their Banh Mi has the traditional french roll baguette vs. Lee's Sandwiches baguette that is shaved down and hard to bite into. Their lunch combos are a great steal!  I got the grilled pork banh mi with the avocado drink special. What's really great is that they are not cash only, they just require $5 minimum for credit cards. The grilled pork was perfectly juicy and they prepared the sandwich on-the-spot with fresh veggies like cilantro and do chua (pickled veggies). My avocado smoothies was light and creamy, I would have preferred more avocado but it came in a large cup. I will stop by again to try more sandwiches. The only thing they are missing are pork buns, but there is a small deli area where you can get to-go items, just ask if you don't see something on the bar!"}
{"text":"Variety of different sandwiches for under $7 including a drink or a smoothie. 

Their bread is freshly made. I like that it's not hard to bite through. A little crunch on the outside and soft in the middle. 

I like the original Vietnamese sandwich. Has lots of filling in the sandwich, that won't leave you hungry."}
{"text":"Much better tasting and higher quality ingredients in their sandwiches and dessert drinks...Definitely beats their rivals like Lee's sandwiches. The staff here are always super friendly. They make you like you're family well if you become a regular that is. Love this place."}
{"text":"Dude. Dude. Dude dude dude.

Mekong Sandwiches and I didn't get off to a perfect start; my first visit, the bread was stale and really disappointing. But the service and the beverages and the sandwich fillings were so good I went back. And I've been back, and back, and I'm going to keep going back because every time afterward the banh mi have been totally on point: Crispy outside, airy inside, and an explosion of flavor in every bite.

If you've been to the worldwide banh mi leviathan over in Chandler, it's worth noting that Mekong Sandwiches has four very nice things their competitor doesn't:
1. Drinks are discounted when you buy a sandwich! Yay savings!
2. BO KHO. Delicious bo kho. If you're not feeling sandwichy, you can opt for stew and a tasty baguette.
3. Cucumbers. Banh mi is always superior with cucumber.
4. A schmear of pate is standard on all the sandwiches. And it's not oppressively liver-y."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches. All the ingredients are so fresh and the meat is delicious. My favorites are grilled beef and op la."}
{"text":"The best banh mi in the valley at the cheapest prices. Sandwiches are so bomb and the people that run it are so nice and friendly. The Thai tea and smoothies are so good! They are sell Pocky and other snacks. Don't pass this place by!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Found it on Yelp when I was in the area looking for something different and I was very pleased. The quality is exceptional! The flavors are awesome, I had the grilled beef sandwich, simply amazing."}
{"text":"Sign and yelp saying close at 7:30. I walked in at 7:05pm and there is a guy mopping and the usual guy that take orders tells me they are all closed for today. Horrible. Drove out here for nothing. They should update their signs and yelp if they changed closing time."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying Bahn Mi's are my favorite sandwiches ever. I've had a metric ton of bahn mi's in my lifetime. In almost every city I visit I seek them out like my life depends on it. For me- it does. So, in comparison to the Bahn Mi's of my past the sandwich I had from Mekong was pretty sub par. The meat- I had chicken and holy was it dry and under flavored. I also asked for double meat and there was hardly what I would consider a single serving of meat on this guy. Sadness. It was then stacked with standard pickled daikon and carrots, cucumber, cilantro, pate and mayo, and a weirdly large amount of red onion. All that was fine. The bread was good though- properly crunchy crust and nice and soft on the inside. The star of the sandwich should definitely be the meat- and Mekong disappointed me on that front. I'm sad cause I was hoping to find a go-to bahn mi joint in the area ."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bahn mi sandwich I've found in AZ!  

The very nice lady behind the counter asked me for feedback as it was my first time here. I normally don't do these types of things but after one bite of this sandwich I was blown away. Freshly baked (on site) bread, freshly grilled meat, pickled veggies, all the normal stuff came together for one amazing sandwich which I would have gladly paid $8 for... Good thing was with tax it cost me $4.16. Crazy!!! 

This is going to be my new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed,  I love this sandwich place. I wanted to give this place a 1 star, but I guess my complaint shouldn't really warrant a 1 star. I placed an order on the phone for pick up and they told me it would be ready in 10 minutes,  I arrived in 15 minutes for some buffer time. My order was not ready and they still had me wait 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Delicious! Enjoy a fresh, exotic and tasty meal in the Viennese restaurant. Perfect for the hot weather."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Dac Biet (special #11) - $3.50

A little bit too much butter or butter-like spread, but the overall sandwich tasted pretty good.  They are very generous on the meats and vegetables.  This place is a definite keeper."}
{"text":"This place is in the corner of this Asian shopping center.  I went to this area for some Taiwanese food, but was craving some boba tea and found it.

Although their bahn mi looks very good, and priced very reasonable.  I was way too full, so just had the boba tea.  I had ordered the taro milk tea that was made into a slushy....my usual.  I took it to go and enjoyed it when I got back to my hotel room.  The flavor was spot on, with the perfectly cooked boba that are not overly sticky or chewy.  Overall, I could have bought another if I was closer.

Definitely, one of the better boba drinks.

By the way, the lady working the front counter was very friendly as I didn't know what to order at first.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"While visiting the market and other stores around, me and a buddy grabbed a sandwich at this amazing sub shop. We got the special, had some kind of mystery meat in it, all kinds of fresh veggies, and by surprise! it was very tasty. Would like to explore more of the items in the store, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The bread is so fresh, the portions are so perfect and they are very nice and clean. I go here at least once a week, sometimes 3-4 times a week. 

The fact that they use fresh ingredients and greens is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I go here at least 2-3 times a week. It is across the street from work and half a block from my house. The sandwiches are top notch. I have tried all of their American style sandwiches and most of the Vietnamese styles as well. I just got done eating a #1 as a matter of fact. This place is great. I don't really have any experience with other Vietnamese sandwich shops but comparing it to other sandwich shops they are the best. The prices are great ($4 for a whole sandwich?!!!) and the quality is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome! Fresh bread, excellent sandwiches and fresh ingredients. I come here often. The service is also great. Very good attitude and smiles which makes all better!!"}
