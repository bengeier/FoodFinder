Hope next time when i come it will be top to the best.

two stars for the food!!"}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I first tried Hakata ramen when it first opened and was blown away by it. I'm not normally a ramen person, but Hakata has made me a believer. I've been to Sansotei and Kinton, and in my opinion Hakata is at least as good (Sansotei) if not better (Kinton). Other people I have brought to Hakata think the same.

So I was shocked to see that Hakata currently has an average rating of 2.5 stars. I've gone through the complaints and most seem to revolve around a couple things. 

- the portion size. The pictures are deceiving. The bowl looks small but I assure you I always leave feeling full, and I pack in more than the average person. I just ate at Kinton and I feel like the portion sizes are the same (I am comparing the two because they are neighbours in North York). 

- wait time - I've been 3-4 times now and have tried all the options except meat lovers. On average the wait time is about 10 minutes. The longest was 20 minutes. Not a huge deal. They were very busy that night. 

- broth / pork flavour. Reviews are mixed. All I can say is try it for yourself and you'll love it. 

Now for my review. In my opinion the black and red (spicy) tonkotsu broth are worth forking over the extra dollar for. The black is a delicious addition of sesame and garlic oil. The red comes with a spoonful of flavourful red paste on the side that you can add to your heart's content. 

The price is the same as any premium ramen place. $10.99 for basic, add $1 or so for extras. Again, Kinton has exactly the same prices, so those complaining are not people who have sampled anything above Aji-sen. 

The decor is great, as others have already mentioned, with Street Fighter art and a small collection of manga to read at the window. 

My hope is that everyone gives Hakata a fair chance. Don't be scared off by the negative reviews, this place is great."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the ramen. The broth was good for what it is but the type of noodles that they use was too thin for my liking. I have been to a lot of ramen joints in Vancouver and Toronto and this is at the bottom of my list. Also the chashu was majority all fat and very little meat. Maybe I got the bad batch but the quality of the food should be better for what they charge. I won't be coming back to try it again."}
{"text":"After more than a dozen visits I can say that this place consistently impresses me with their food quality and service which is why I felt obliged to update my review after visiting again last night. 

Their ramen is probably the best in TO even compared to non-Hakata style establishments. The tonkatsu broth is rich and not too salty; the chasu is cooked, seasoned and sliced just right; the noodles are always fresh and with the right amount of spring; and their side accompaniments just make their ramen shine even more. I like their ghost pepper side for an extra kick or rather a nice warm kick and their boiled egg was perfectly creamy and salted. 

Definitely check out the place if you are in the area but if you are looking for an authentic ramen experience it's well worth the trek up north as well."}
{"text":"ordered tonkotsu ramen n karake. soup was not as thick & portion was smaller than expected but overall tasted good. additional cost ($1-2) for toppings, green tea, ... and menu seem to lack variety. good price for icecream though. food 3/5 service 4.5/5"}
{"text":"This place consistently provides good food and good, friendly service. I absolutely love their black broth and their perfectly timed eggs. Plus, the artwork is amazing.

During one of my visits, they went over and above to accommodate my friend's baby."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had their lunch special for $13 you get a bowl of tonkotsu ramen and a rice dish. 

First I was just by myself so I sat at the bar table..wasn't too impress by the cleanness because there were alot of small insects that were crawling around..

I ordered the ramen and a karaage don and added the marinated egg for $1.5 

Ramen - The Noodles I opt for the thin and it was good, you can taste that it was al dente, which is what I like but the broth....IT WAS EXTREMELY OILY !! to the point it was shinny...which made it seem gross every time I took a sip of it but besides from it looking oily the taste over all was great. The meat that came along with it was paper thin and you get 2 slices

marinated egg- was done right I liked the taste which was not too salty and the yolk was not fully cooked

Karaage don..came with 3 pcs of chicken , rice, sauce, and mayo..I was surprised that this was good ! I can just order this next time alone without the ramen!

Over all for lunch + tips $18 is pretty expensive..I don't think I'll return and if I do I'll just order the Karaage done which is just $4.50"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, had to wait a bit for a table but wasn't too bad. The restaurant had a witty name and wittier paintings on the wall. Any street fighter fan would be tempted to steal the paintings.  I ordered the black garlic oil noodle, and can't say I liked it. The oil tasted like burnt garlic and ruined the whole bowl of soup... Should've gotten the original... The egg wasn't included and had to be ordered separately. It was a little too cooked for my taste.  Looked like it has a pretty good deal for weekday lunch special, though can't say I would be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I went with three of my friends and we all liked it. The hard wood layout and atmosphere of the place was unique and welcoming. The food was delicious. We ordered all their new entrees and liked each one as well as their pork belly ramens. The pork belly was the best pork belly I've ever had, it just melts in your mouth. If nothing else, go there for the pork belly! We will be back very soon"}
{"text":"Very flavourful broth (and not too salty!) , generous portions and toppings (compared to other joints in the area), reasonable price. Been coming here for a long time and the quality is pretty consistent. I really like their wavy noodle tonkatsu + karage. Service is great. Honestly surprised that the rating is not higher."}
{"text":"I visited with a bud after my sis told me about the Ramen SF wall art and ordered the karage and gyoza as apps and the red hot tonkotsu with wavy noodles.  Great tasting broth and the noodles firm and chewy as they should be. 

 The service was attentive and efficient, the place wonderfully busy and bustling (waited only 15 mins at 7:30pm on a Thursday when the place was full). Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"The noodles are delicious but the soup base has a tad too much MSG. Would come back if that improves. 

Service is good, the servers are attentive and makes you feel welcome. Customer service is so important these days and I feel it gets lost on a lot companies. This noodle shop does it right. The Japanese are more courteous."}
{"text":"Has a very authentic feel of a Japanese ramen house. The food of course is the real deal, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I come here once a week at least!"}
{"text":"One of the worst ramen ever. I have been to all the ramen shops in Toronto and this was a huge fail. The broth did not taste anything like Tonkatsu, it was missing that creamy richness that it is suppose to have The noodles were under cooked. The chashu was tasteless, all you can taste is the burnt bits that was done by the torch. The portion was extremely small and the price was greater than other ramen shops.

In addition to the ramen, I also had the fried chicken. It was pretty tasty. But then again you can't really go wrong with fried chicken. 

I give one star because its still no the worst ramen in Toronto. Its much better than niwatei, kenzo, and ajisen. But if you are looking for the best ramen that you can get I would suggest santouka or sansotei.

I would also give another star just for it's convenience if you live around Yonge and Sheppard area. I would actually give credit to the restaurant for having the best ramen in North York."}
{"text":"A new ramen shop has opened up in the Yonge/Sheppard area and we decided to pay them a visit!  By this date, they have been open for 4 days so I assumed that they would have fixed any issues that they would have by now.  I was wrong.

The restaurant is a play on the name of a move in the video game Street Fighter.  As such, they even have painting up that depict Street Fighter characters doing something with ramen (whether cooking or eating).

The prices are reasonable at $9.80 for the normal Tonkotsu ramen, add $1.00 for a soy based version of the tonkotsu or get one that is spicy.  We ordered the regular tonkotsu ramen and the spicy version of the same thing.  For reasons unknown to me, it took 30 minutes before we got our meal.  The restaurant barely holds 40 people, so I thought the orders would go by pretty quickly but I was wrong.

The dumplings seem like potstickers that I could buy frozen from a grocery store instead of hand-made on site.  The ramen was disappointing.  I'm not sure where they are imported from, but they are nothing special.  The soup base lacked flavor, and the two pieces of chashu that we got were VERY fatty.  My $1.00 meant that I got a spoonful of hot sauce with my tonkotsu.  They don't mix it in, isn't a different soup base, it is just the regular tonkotsu with a spoon of hot sauce!

We arrived at the restaurant at around 7:50pm which I thought was late, but we still had to wait around 10 minutes to be seated.  By the time we got our order (8:30pm), the restaurant was already sold out of ramen for the day.

Verdict: I would not recommend coming here and I don't see it lasting very long."}
{"text":"Broth was rich but a tad too oily. Charsu was amazing - fatty and nicely charred from a quick sear before they put it in the bowl.  

Had gone at 8:30 on a Friday night and we were the second last people in before they ran out of charsu. I overheard them saying that they had made 40kgs but ran out. No idea if that's a lot or not. 

Also had the karaage (delish!) and wings (good but rather small).

Service was super slooooow. Definitely the slowest ramen place I've ever been to. But it was tasty and close to home so I will be going again.... At least until that *other* ramen place opens at empress!"}
{"text":"I have tried most ramen places downtown and around and Hakata is my favorite  - very warm inside during summer but worth it - great portion size and add ons and good thick noodles"}
{"text":"I ordered the black tonkatsu ramen, it was not good. The broth didn't have any flavor. It didn't taste anything like ramen. I was really disappointed and would never come back."}
{"text":"One of the best ramen places in Toronto. Certainly the best in North York. Their soup is very authentic. Has really good flavor. A bit on the greasy side but it works for me. They r still working on expanding their menu so check out this place time to time cuz it's worth it."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Wish we have this in Phoenix AZ. What a treat! The broth was deliciously complementary to both the wavy and straight noodle options. Not as a big fan for fatty pork belly but every time I managed to finish everything in the bowl. Don't forget the extra noodle that you can order to finish off the broth ;-)"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times, and it always amazes me how CAPCOM hasn't sent this place a cease-and-desist letter or potential copyright-infringement for the artistic freedoms based on their Street Fighter art. But that's another story for another day on another site...

Restaurant size:
Cozy, about 6 tables for 2-4 patrons each and 2 bar-style bench tables. However, I've ever only seen the window-facing bar seating used, which can squeeze maybe 5-6 people. If you come here with more than 1 person and want to face each other, be prepared to wait a bit...

Food quality:
A fan of the black tonkotsu broth! But there could be a bit more meat and noodles, although there IS an option to get extra noodles or a noodles refill for $2. Is a pre-tax/tip black tonkotsu broth w/ extra noodle worth it? That's up to you to find out! If you're ultra hungry, pieces of karage and a tonkotsu ramen might not cut it for you...

Service:
Very friendly, helpful and accommodating servers! but please be patient as sometimes there may be miscommunication due to the music volume -OR- misunderstanding; you may need to explain certain terms more than once, or describe it with simpler English. 

Ramen arrives quickly after ordering!

Final thoughts:
If you'd like to marvel at the Street Fighter-inspired art while enjoying a quick bowl of ramen, you should consider coming in! If you're with a large group...you might want to reconsider -OR- LIVE XTREME AND COME IN!!!111"}
{"text":"Had a lunch today here at Shyo Ryu Ken.
Nice and clean little place with Eric Clapton's playing, sweet! Me and my wife sat on the corner where the comic books placed, quite a good idea to put some comic books to read while wait for the food.

I had the lunch menu, the tonkotsu ramen with karaage don, wifey had the red tonkotsu,which is a regular tonkotsu ramen with a spicy red sauce on the side, she said the sauce is delicious. The ramen is okay, the broth is very light but more to a bland side, but the meat is delicious with an amazing roasted flavor and some smokiness to it, sadly it's only 2 very small and thin pcs, please consider to add more of the meat, or slice it thicker, please please please.

The karaage don is quite the saving grace from the light and bland ramen broth. The chicken is moist, the teriyaki sauce is really good, sure can tell it's homemade, good job on the sauce!

Service is very friendly and fast, well, since it's not too busy, but it's very good. If they can improve the ramen broth flavor, this place could be a competition for the next door neighbor.."}
{"text":"One good place for ramen! The noodles are average but the soup is so thick and tasty, especially the Black Tonkotsu with black sesame oil almost covering the surface of the bowl added even more flavor to the already very delicious soup. 

The egg needs to be mentioned too. The yolk is cooked to perfect consistency and full of flavor inside out, how they do it, I have no idea......if I were to guess, smoked."}
{"text":"I go several times to a location to get an average score lol. Disappointed this time around, mainly because of the slow service. My meter's about to run out (paid for an hour) and the interior is hot, like the air con isn't working. The staff are friendly, and that's the only thing I could think of that was good for this visit.

I don't like hakata style that much, I think."}
{"text":"I personally really enjoyed the ramen soup there. It was  thick but NOT toooo salty! I usually request for low sodium, but most ramen houses just don't understand it.

This place probably leans on the expensive ends. They charge $1.5 for an egg where most other places would have half an egg already in their ramen. 

The pork is pretty nice too, it's not fried."}
{"text":"The waitress was super friendly, I went with few of my friends and I tried the hakata style ramen with their very juicy chashu which melts in your mouth. The broth of ramen was nice and thick and creamy and it goes very well with hakata style ramen. Noodle texture was thin but really goes well with the broth.   My friends liked it as well and will definitely come back for more!  I've been to other noodle houses but still prefer this one!"}
{"text":"Best ramyun in Toronto personally
Noodles are chewy big pieces of meat!! I come here all the time"}
{"text":"I am a fan small ramen houses and this place fits the bill quite nicely. It is a small but well run ramen joint in the Yonge Finch area. Their ramen is not too pricey but doesn't come with many toppings and an egg is an additional $1.50. I consider eggs kind of essential to a ramen so it kind of miffed me when it was an extra. I had the cold ramen which was perfect for a summer lunch. In the past I've also had the garlic ramen which I didn't love. 

I will say that the Takoyaki was delicious. I really want to come back to try other appetizers. they also have a lunch special for an appetizer and ramen for $13."}
{"text":"Been here couple times already. Their soup is really rich in flavor. Chasu pieces were so tender and had smokey flavor. Wait time was short - less than 5min on Sunday lunch hours. Service was quick. Portion was good. Price was decent. I will def return when I crave ramen."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite spot for Ramen in the city. The broth is phenomenal! It's all about the broth and the chashu here. 

The service is very slow, especially during peak hours. Expect to wait in line during the  lunch/dinner rush. The longest wait was a little over 30 minutes. 

If you can overlook the wait-time, I highly suggest this little place. The best ramen broth in the city!"}
{"text":"Hakata providing diffierent ramen type comes from Fukuoka, their soup is fresh and rich,  you will feel full after tasted it.
I am very impressed by their chashu as they using burner to butn a bit the rim of chashu so it comes much more smoky favor and crispy. I tried their blsck garlic oil ramen also nice as  its after taste is not too strong but nice enough.  Quality of noodle omis quite good too but i preferred kyouka's getting better chewy. Their prices is cheap too,  only abt $10  you can have a very nice quality ramen while $13 can have tsmen+ donburi+ snack in weekdays,  i must go back again for other dishes. Location is convenient enough on north york,  similar competitord all around,  ajisen ramen & kinton,  but none of them is in my list except Hakata,  if their interrior can be improve more will be much appreciate especially around the basement. This is the only thing i feel can be better lol."}
{"text":"Hakata Tonkatsu Ramen offers a variety of Tonkatsu (pork bone broth) based options with choices of either thin noodles or wavy egg noodles. (Extra noodles are an additional $2)

Relatively packed on Saturday lunch, we were seated by the bar within a few minutes. I tried out the basic Tonkatsu broth ($9.80) and for $13, you get seven pieces of Chasu instead of two. Quite a big price difference for a few more pieces in my opinion.

The Chasu is delicious, it is thinly sliced so the fat doesn't taste too overwhelming. The noodles are a bit undercooked, but I'm a fan of the texture. The only complaint I have is their soup base is not creamy enough compared to other Tonkatsu I had. The meal left me super thirsty as the soup can get salty as I worked on my bowl. 

I love the effort put into the decor and service is friendly and quick. They really just need to work on that soup base."}
{"text":"There's usually a long line here as the restaurant is very small. There's sometimes a line even before the place opens. The interior is all wood, which is pretty cute (reminds me of Moji). They allow you to pick between thick and thin noodles. There's only a few options and they're all variations of the original. 

I ordered a Hakata Tonkotsu ($9.80) with thin noodles and added a marinated egg ($1.50). The broth was way too salty for my liking. 

We ordered kaarage and takoyaki to share. The kaarage was just fried chicken, nothing special. I'm not a huge fan of takoyaki in general. It's like a tiny piece of octopus inside a pancake ball.

It's one of the better ramen places in Toronto, but it's still incomparable than Japan. I usually don't go for ramen in Toronto, but this little place could satisfy my ramen craving every now and then."}
{"text":"If I were to rank ramen places that I have tried in Toronto, I would put this as #2 (#1 being Santouka). The main reason why I like this place is because it's the main true ramen restaurant in the north end of the city. Everything else is located downtown. In the north this place is competing against Kenzo Ramen, Kinton Ramen and Ajisen Ramen.

This place is not easy to find with the bare eye. It's right on Yonge and McKee, next to the korean H-Mart and across from Owl of Minerva. It's a small mom and pop restaurant covered in all wood. 

I happen to go when it was not busy and in a middle of a snow storm. It seats around 30 people with a wide open view of the kitchen. The menu selection is limited but enough to accompany the common customer. There are 4 ramen  choices: Hakata Tonkatsu (simple miso ramen), Black Tonkatsu (miso with black garlic flavour), Red Hot Tonkatsu (a tad spicier with korean spicy paste), Chashu Tonkatsu (same as Hakata Tonkatsu but with extra pork belly). The appetizer selection are also scarce with the simple edamame, chicken wings, fried chicken and soy based tofu. 

The ramen was thinner and (in my opinion) fit better with the soup base they are serving. The other locations have the typical thick ramen which just becomes too heavy for the meal. The soup base was fair and not too salty, which is why I think Kinton was not listed on top of this place. They give you 4 pieces of pork belly for all the ramen bowls except for Chashu Tonkatsu where they give you another 4 pieces. The soft boiled egg is good but not included with the meal and the yoke is soft. I hate it when I go to places and the egg is hard and overcooked and even worst if the yoke is cooked. That pisses me off the most.

There was a special where if you order an appetizer you can receive a Sapporo draft for $3.80. 

Overall this place is quick, clean and simple. Portions are fair and so is the pricing.

Highly recommend this place... just do it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ramen at Hakata Shoryuken and I walked out wondering why it didn't have a higher rating on Yelp. I guess everyone has different tastes and criteria, so after reading other reviews in detail, it makes sense. For me, how the ramen tastes is the most important factor, with things like price and service affecting my overall impression.

I had whatever the \"normal\" standard ramen is, I guess the tonkatsu ramen with straight noodles, and I tasted the red tonkatsu ramen. I thought both were very good, the broth was very rich and tasted pretty salty but actually did not make me thirsty afterwards, which is typically how I judge how much sodium I've actually ingested. Noodles were springy with a nice texture. And the chashu had been finished with a torch or grill to give it a slight smoky flavour which I thought made it pretty distinct from all the other ramen places.

The food came out so quickly that I thought they had made a mistake and brought me someone else's ramen.

The two minor negatives I found were: 1) there are only two pieces of chashu by default - enough for me but not for the guys 2) the restaurant kind of smelled funky, like stale beer or something.

Overall though, the ramen was tasty and I like how quick the service was, and that's what I think this type of restaurant is all about."}
{"text":"I visited with my friends for a hearty meal of Japanese ramen.
I ordered the normal tonkotsu ramen with no additional toppings. The overall quality of the food was alright, but I felt the soup could have had more seasoning because it had subtle flavours compared to other ramen places. Two slices of chashu were alright but nothing out of the ordinary. Considering that the other places charges much more with more toppings, the price range is about the same. Just like all other places, the portion of food was underwhelming and I could finish two bowls if I was hungry.
The restaurant, including the bathroom, was clean and tidy. The service was rather slow but definitely friendly. It is really a 3.5-star, but I will rate 4-star for now. I would like to visit again and try their more expensive options with more toppings."}
{"text":"This little place on Yonge serves up average quality ramen. Interior decor is nice and the service is on point. Arriving at just the right hour before dinner time can avoid waiting at the door for tables. The food here is not bad by common standard, but certainly not the best ramen in this neighborhood. If you go for their original hakata ramen, the bland broth is not very inspiring. Their appetizers are more flavorful."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy store, love the wooden built of the restaurant. Really stands out and feels a bit authentic. They have mangas available to read if you're down for that too!

You get the option of straight (thin&traditional) or wavy (thick&chewy), personally recommend the wavy though.

$13.99 Chashu Lover (RECOMMEND) comes with 7 slices of pork belly in the ramen. 

$11.99 Black Tonkotsu Ramen (RECOMMEND) comes with black garlic oil and 2 slices of pork belly. 

Definitely add marinated egg for $1.5! Worth.

Karage (DO NOT RECOMMEND), comes with a decent portion but it's poorly flavoured. A big soggy too and not worth the price. 

In terms of uptown ramen, it's definitely one of the top contenders. But if you hit up downtown, it'll only be mediocre in comparison."}
{"text":"Had the tonkatsu pork ramen today with an egg as an added topping!  Very yummy and flavourful!  Pork was also very tender!  I also got the karage fried chicken as an app - but that was so so.  Not much flavour and felt like I was just chewing batter dipped in mayo.

Decor and atmosphere are pretty neat here - very small quaint place and I love the street fighter paintings!!

Overall a decent spot for high quality ramen - although a little pricier than most ramen spots.  You dooo get what you pay for though - would recommend this place even to ramen snobs!  :)"}
{"text":"Originally from VA, USA and my boyfriend, his little cousin, and I were looking for a quick bite but craving ramen...we ran into this location unexpectedly and were extremely impressed with their quality for such a quick service. We order red hot ramen and the regular ramen and both were absolutely delicious! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of my husband's favourite ramen place. As usual, he ordered a glass of Muskoka Mad Tom that has citrus flavour in the beer. For noodles, we ordered a Tan Tan Ramen. The presentation of the noodles looks pretty good. I found the soup thick and creamy and it has rich flavour. Even though we requested for less spicy, the soup is still bit spicy. Instead of having chasu in the noodle, it has lean pork with vegetables in the soup. It tastes so good that I wanted to keep on eating and finishing up the soup."}
{"text":"The karage don is really good. The soup base of hakata tonkotsu is pretty good (not as salty as other Japanese ramen places). However, their pork (in the soup) and the marinated egg are cold. I asked the server, he said they put them in the fridge. So it's not freshly made."}
{"text":"This is a small ramen shop run by a husband and wife.  I spoke to the chef and he hails from southern japan and sought to bring this flavour to his shop.  I have had ramen in several cities in Japan and this tastes authentic to me.  I did not find it too salty which is sometimes an issue.  I had the beef entree and the tofu entree as well and my wife and I really enjoyed the meal and thought about our visit to Japan!"}
{"text":"The ramen soup was rich, but flavour was very basic. Almost only saltiness when it came to flavour. I also found ridiculous to have to pay $1.50 extra just for eggs, which I feel is a basic vital part in a bowl of ramen. The noodle quality was great; it didn't grab any soup.

Overall I'm glad I tried, but I'm afraid won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Live in the hood and first time was not a pleasant experience but I've learned I really only enjoy the classic miso or tonkatsu ramens wherever I go. The tonkatsu broth ramen is richer than kintons down the street so it was pleasant drinking it. The meat was not fat enough for me however but they have some lunch special where u could pair up ramen and a don bowl for the same price.  

Would pop in again if I crave the ramens."}
{"text":"They had lots of Japanese manga for people like me to pretend read. They have a good lunch combo menu. If you're looking for a snack, get their karaage instead. I feel like they mispriced this by a couple bucks cause for $5 you get like almost a meal. Ramen is so so, they weren't too generous with any pork slices. 

It wasn't busy the times I went (weekday dinners and lunches). Quick service!"}
{"text":"This ramen shop is located on the southeast corner of Church Ave. and Yonge St., next to the H-Mart grocery store.  I ordered the Black Tonkotsu and it came with bean sprouts, negi, 2 thinly sliced chashu and kikurage but no egg which is $1.50 extra.  And looking at the additional toppings there doesn't seem to be any bamboo shoots available which are my fave.

The broth was flavourful, full bodied but tad oily and maybe a little too overly seasoned.  The wavy noodles were also a little too chewy almost undercooked (thin noodles are available as well), toppings were standard and there was a distinct bitter aftertaste to the broth, probably from the burnt garlic or something. Unfortunately there were just too many \"little\" inconsistencies which made for a lack lustre dining experience.

I wouldn't go out of my way for this very average ramen place, especially when there is a Sansotei at Byng/Yonge. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Location/Service
Along Yonge St, the restaurant is right beside the H-Mart (near Captain's Boil). 
Really like their interior - which has free comics for you to read (English versions) and a traditional Japanese feeling of wooden chairs and tables. 
Size is relatively small, fit around 20 people - so it can get pretty busy during peak hours. 
Staff were also friendly and easy to communicate. 

Food
Tried the beef tataki - which has around 6 slices. Beef is sliced thinly, fresh and good appetizer before the ramen. 
Ramen - ordered the Chasu with wavy long noodles. Love how there's 7 pieces of chasu for you eat, each is fatty but super delicious and cooked to the right level. The noodles were also good, not soggy and chewy. Broth was fresh to taste, not oily or overly heavy with flavor. 

Overall it's one of the better places to eat ramen in North York. I would like to try their other ramen to see if there's any difference."}
{"text":"It's our fav ramen place!! The ramen soup n the noodle is very close to what we had in japan. The pork chashu are very tender and melt in your mouth!! Staff are so friendly and the place it quite cozy and very clean!
Plus they got Sapporo on 
Check this place out If you want authentic Japanese taste:)"}
{"text":"My wife say this is authentic HAKATA ramen.  Me, I've never tried the REAL deal so I can't say if it was good.  For me it lacked something in the broth.  My wife is Japanese.... She knows what she talking about.  AUTHENTIC Hakata ramen lives here."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times in the past 3-4 years or so.  I live in the area so it makes it a closer option to go to, and typically you don't have to wait unlike some of the other ramen places.

Recently though, there's a lot of competition around with other ramen or chinese pull noodle places opening up south of Yonge/Finch.  

I'd put Hakata Shoryuken MUCH above the likes of Aji San Ramen or Kenzo, but I would put them below the likes of San So Tei and Santouka.  

You will not be disappointed here, but it's not the best bowl in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were intrigued by the Street Fighter theme of this place so we decided to give it a try. I had the Red Hot Tonkotsu Ramen and beef tataki on the side. The ramen is very rich and flavorful and I only used half of the red spicy sauce served with ramen so that I could really taste the broth. The  tataki was nothing special though so perhaps next time I'll stick to the ramen here. A good alternative to when you wanna try something other than the more popular ramen joints in the area."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo amazing. They have the best Kaarage that is not too much batter and a lot of meat!! The place is decorated in Street Fighter themed decor and the servers are amazing and kind. Highly recommend to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"This place was not the worst nor the best. As the name suggests the ramen style is from Hakata which is from Fukuoka region in Japan. I have to admit I'm not too familiar with this style of ramen but from what I am used to, I found the noodles a little starchy for my liking.  I ordered the hot ramen which is a spoon full of Korean hot bean paste that you can mix in with your ramen. I also ordered the fried chicken (karage) which was 6/10 in my books. I agree with Amanda C  that this place is better then ajisen ramen (one of the worst places to Goto) and put it at par with Kenzo ramen. But totally disagree with her opinion about Niwatei. Niwatei is the best IMO and does not charge you extra for egg and ginger where Hakata does."}
{"text":"This new spot uptown, that opened maybe a week before the kinton down the street. It is the real deal, BUT the portions are way too small even more me. They really only have one type of ramen, with the choice of 3 different broths. And the choice of triple meat, every thing else is an add on. Broth is good, I liked it, not as garlicky as kinton and still flavourful, the noodle is also on point, but those bowls got to go, and some thing adult size needs to replace them. Also the place is small ish but has a nice  authentic ramen joint feel. Hope to see them make it, I'm sure they will seeing as how there is only kinton down the street that's real Japanese ramen (unlike the 3 other Korean ramen spots)"}
{"text":"Great food, cozy ambience and a great owner! Ghost Pepper sauce was great! Can't say much else!"}
{"text":"Second time here and had the Spicy Red Hot Tonkotsu with wavy ramen. Gotta say it's quite delicious. 

The soup is very well seasoned and not at all that salty compared to Santouka on Dundas/Church.

The portion is decent for $10.80 and you can always add extra noodles for $2. 

Service was good. Would come back again to try the other soup base.

{"text":"Delicious ramen in North York! I've tried all the downtown ones this one might not be there yet but definitely an uptown gem! 

I've tried the Hakata Tonkotsu and the Black Tonkotsu, I think I still like the original one. Broth is rich sometimes too rich! Noodle is good. Chashu is very tender and not too fatty. Soup is very flavourful. The black Tonkotsu seems more garlicky sesame flavour and less pork flavour, broth not as rich. Nice warm homey atmosphere with friendly staff. Like this more than Kinton. Chicken wings really small. Will definitely come back for ramen!"}
{"text":"Decent service, very nice decor but the ramen was just okay. It was solid but it didn't blow my mind. However, I definitely have to give it props for being wayyy better than the Kinton Ramen down the street. Probably is the best solid ramen place in the finch area to be honest.
It's really more of a 3.5 than a 3 stars. I would come here again for my next ramen craving."}
{"text":"It is not the worst ramen in town, but it is bad.
--The broth is really thick and heavy. I even need to add water into the soup base to make it lighter. 
--The portion is smaller than other ramen places.
--The noodle was not perfectly good either.
--It is cash only for now, which is very inconvenient.

Overall, i don't think i will go back  again. It is very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for lunch today. Not too impressed with the quality of the food. We ordered one miso tonkotsu, the black garlic oil tonkotsu ramen and chicken karaage. The wavy noodles in one of the bowls was all clumped together (need to do a better job of separating during cooking) and the pork was overly fatty. The tonkotsu soup base was also very greasy in both bowls. I have had other to tonkotsu soup bases that does not have a good hick layer of oil on top. The chicken karaage pieces had chunks of chicken fat in it which was not too appetizing. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Get the wavy noodle.  It is the best.  In addition to the ramen that is always delicious, we always get the kaarage chicken and the tako wasa.  Both are great side dishes.  Turnover of tables is pretty quick so even if there is a line up, it goes by pretty fast.  I wish though that they had a better waiting area as it literally is the doorway.  I also like their frequent stamp card."}
{"text":"I've heard really good things about Hakata, and after checking their website and seeing $9.80 hakata tonkotsu ramen, decided to come here for dinner.

When you walk up to the restaurant, you'll see the distinct wooden design. Once you're in, you'll see a row of manga and other reading material available. Perhaps while you're waiting? Or maybe to use while you're slurping those noodles and flipping pages with oily fingers? Hopefully not the latter.

They've got some interesting artwork hanging on the walls of popular street fighter characters...holding bowls of ramen!

After looking at the menu, it looks like their website is outdated. The prices for ramen are only a dollar higher, but they should try to keep their main website updated, if anything. They also have new ramen bowls (compared to what's written on their website) such as a \"Red Hot Tonkotsu\" and a \"Cold Ramen\".

We ordered a Hakata Tonkotsu and a Cold Ramen with no extra toppings, both with wavy thick noodles. The bowls arrived within 10 minutes. I suppose this is a perfect opportunity to pick up some reading material while you're waiting for the food.

The Hakata Tonkotsu comes with two pieces of chashu, a handful of black mushroom,s green onions, and some noodles. The broth is quite tasty and not greasy at all; don't hesitate to empty the bowl. The chashu was round and thin, and somewhat chewy. Overall, there isn't much variety in flavour, so you might need to add some more toppings: the ramen became a bit bland after a few bites.

The cold ramen bowl is the same as the hakata, except it costs $2 more, and they use a vegetable broth. I didn't like this as much and would rather just go with the hakata. The broth is pretty important and I'd like a rich broth. It's not even a vegetarian dish, I'm not sure what the point is...I guess if you like a light vegetable broth?

I've heard from others that the amount of food you get here is \"much more than kinton or sansotei\", but I wouldn't say that's an accurate statement. At most, you get maybe a bit more, for pretty much the same price. The thick wavy noodles weren't particularly thick, and I'm kind of curious how thin the thin noodles are.

On the way down to the washrooms, you'll pass by the employee-only prep room, and it's really hot and stuffy down there, which results in an unpleasant stench emanating from the room. I'm not too concerned about cleanliness of the working conditions as long as they're passing health safety inspections, but it's not pleasant.

In terms of ramen, they're competing with sansotei, kinton, and menya fuji between Finch and North York Centre. And if you add chinese noodle soup to the mix, there's a lot of options. I'm feeling more Big Beef Bowl over this place."}
{"text":"Pretty average ramen in my opinion, but it is still better than the ramen franchise that starts with a \"k\" down the road. The chashu lovers ramen had a tasty broth. However, the chashu (bbq pork) slices were too thin. The seating was also a bit cramped. There was no where to put your coats or bags. The floors were also extremely slippery. I get its winter, but the restuarant should still do its due diligence to prevent customer injuries. Overall, an okay ramen shop to grab a quick bit, but definitely don't go out of your way for this."}
{"text":"2nd best Ramen place in Toronto, behind Santoka - but this place doesn't get the massive lineups, so it balances out with Santoka. They also earn points for the Nintendo street fighter theme!"}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend with some friends.   Pretty good place it not that many tables.   We were lucky and just beat the rush.

Staff here is really attentive and friendly.   Lots of good things to choose from.  I had the 7 PC of meat ramen dish.   Flavour was really good.     The fried chicken here is quite tasty and for the portion the $5 for this dish is more than worth it.   I was pretty full with what I ordered but for $2 you can refill the ramen; so that is exactly what I did.   I was so full when I finished as I could have timed my refill of ramen order better (think I sat to long and got full).   Still I have no regrets :).  Wish the egg came in the ramen, but you can always add on an egg. 

I would definately go back.   Love the street fighter wall art and their t-shirt uniforms are quite cute (street fighter related)."}
{"text":"Went there on a Wed night and got a seat right away. They specialize in hakkata style ramen which has thinner noodles. They have a traditional soup base,hot and a sesame flavored. The portions are but smaller than kinton and the amount of pork they give you is less as well.  Iordered the sesame soup base and The soup was well flavored and noodles were coupled well. We also ordered the fried chicken which was just avg. It wasn't as crunchy as other places I have tired and portions were small. 
I'd say this is better than kenzo,but not as good as kinton"}
{"text":"Had the Hakata Tonkatsu Ramen Lunch Combo with the Karage Rice. Overall the service was decent but the food was below par.

-Broth is way too rich
-The thin egg noodles didn't really go with the broth, the noodles were almost like the thin egg noodles at a Chinese restaurant 
-I admire them torching the Charsu for a little bit of a crisp but the fat that's on it needs to be cooked down more, besides the unappetizing richness there's a slight foul aftertaste from the meat and the broth (probably from not rinsing the meat properly)
-The broth taste off, taste more like the Chinese soups u get at the start of your meal for dinner except with more lard
-Karage was OK, the sauce that came with it was a decent
-Service was somewhat attentive
-They have some manga to read as well I think

Overall North York still has a poor selection for Ramen, Kinton still taste very bland and the service there is pretty terrible, I would probably consider the Korean Franchise Kenzo over this place but their style of ramen is different but at least enjoyable. The Chinese owners of Hakata should probably be more focused on the flavor of their food rather than just hoping their Japanese kitchen staff can pump out food like the competition. The Chinese front of the house should be a little bit more attentive and mindful as oppose to the owner checking up on us and filling up our waters.

All in all I still believe that Ryuu on Baldwin takes the crown for Ramen, because their pretty much the closes you're going to get to Tokyo, followed further down with perhaps Santouka and Raijin although they all use the same pork broth concentrate that Nishimoto supplies them.

Will I repeat? Maybe if they notify me that they greatly altered the recipe and completely control the lard levels so that when I left I didn't have to go to H-mart to find something to wash out all that fat that was clinging in my mouth. I hope for further improvement because I prefer their interior over Kinton by a good margin. Please improve the reputation of Chinese operated Japanese restaurants just like Inatei up in Markham, because at the moment I'm not impressed. Best of luck"}
{"text":"I like their noodles especially the black pork one. 100% made by Japanese. This is my 2nd visit, still very good!  My kids loves the dragon balls graphic novels there. I will visit here again for sure. U can have a free noodle when u collect 9 stamps. Easy to find parking at the rear streets around. Hope it helps."}
{"text":"I'm really not a big fan of ramen but if I had to choose a place, this would be it. I took these photos on my third visit and this was when I was really about to get a better perception of a multitude of factors - service, food, and atmosphere.
This was definitely an impulse meal. My friend would usually go to Ajisen down the street but I was dying to show him this place for a while. We came about 30 minutes to close and had doubts whether this place would still be open for food. Luckily, we found free parking on Yonge Street immediately (free after 10 pm I believe on weekdays). One thing I recall about this place is how diverse and friendly the staff were. There were about two other tables there at the same time as us. 
We ended up ordering Hakata Tonkatsu ($10) and Tantan Men ($13.5). We got a mix of thin noodles for the tonkatsu and thicker noodles for the tantan men. 
Our food arrived about 10 minutes later and still tasted amazing. Nothing was too salty, noodles were not too mushy. It was my first time trying the Tantan men and despite it being a heavy dish, I still wanted more. 
For the price and quality, this place is worth the try!"}
{"text":"Another ramen joint in North York! I was excited to try this relatively new place with my boyfriend since we live in the area and have pretty much been to all of the ramen places in town. I liked the ramen (a thinner noodle) and the flavour of the broth even though both are a bit different than other ramen places I have been to (i.e. Kinton Ramen nearby). The appetizers were quite reasonably priced. I found the service a bit slow, but I am sure they will improve over time given that they are fairly new. They also have bentobox magazines and manga for customers, which I thought was a nice touch. I wouldn't say that this would be my go-to ramen place, but would definitely return. They have some tough competition in this area, but worth giving a try!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday and was seated by the window for a table of one immediately. Although there were other customers in the restaurant, the service was always quick and the food was hot.

The restaurant itself isn't large and could fit approximately 30 people in total. I ordered their lunch special, which is available from 12-3 for $13.99. You get a set Hakata Tonkatsu ramen (topped with green onion, black mushrooms, two pieces of char siu, and bean sprouts) and a choice between either Fried Chicken with rice or more Char Siu with rice.

I ordered the fried chicken with rice and in about 5 minutes, my rice had come! It was a small portion with 3 pieces of chicken topped with Japanese mayonnaise, green onions, and chilli flakes. The rice was lightly soaked in sweet soy sauce. It was quite pleasant and THE  highlight of my meal! The Hakata Tonkatsu on the other hand, was not as great. The noodles were too tough and took a while to take in the heat from the broth. The broth was nothing spectacular and was very meh. I would've personally liked different toppings with my ramen (like corn for a hint of sweetness). The two pieces of meat were also quite standard.

I think I would have to come back only to order the rice... which was BOMB!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty similar to Sansotei. I've tried a lot of ramen shops this year and I don't see a notable difference with this one. I had the black tonkatsu ramen. I find Kinton's broth richer. This place is good too but I think Kinton wins. I think the \"blackness\" comes from something burnt. Which I thought tasted good but left a slight after taste. 

It's still very good. I would return but Kinton is my top choice. Prices are pretty standard for a ramen place."}
{"text":"Located within a 7 min walking distance from North York Centre, Hakata is a convenient place to grab ramen during or after a commute.  Inside, the capacity size is small, and table space is limited, but we were able to fit our group of 6 with ease during a Saturday evening.  There wasn't a line up and only a few people came in while we were there, so I would say it's safe to stay for an hour and not rush yourself with a quick ramen fix. 

I ordered the Karaage, Takoyaki, and Black Tonkatsu Ramen. Out of these, I would only recommend the ramen. The Karaage was bland and small in portion size, and the Takoyaki was chewier and less dressed than what I usually receive. Even the ramen itself was only passable. The broth was not salty, but, at the same time, had no wow factor to it to make it memorable. Additionally, the chasu slices were thin and delicious, making them the only toppings that we really liked since the remaining were mostly bean sprouts.  Finally, the noodles didn't really have any character to them, which was strange as often times the noodles are a key component to a hearty ramen dish. I don't mean to be harsh, but I really felt that the noodles were low in quality and ''straight from the package''. 

Other than its convenient location, I wouldn't be egging to go here for a second round.  If you're eager to fix a ramen craving in this area, then by all means go ahead!"}
{"text":"As ppl reviewed below, service is good, food wasnt... got the cha shu ramen lunch combo for $13. Also got chicken wings n pint of sapporo beer ($3.80... couldnt resist) ....  Broth in ramen was ok, thin noodles style ramen (not my thing - not what im used to when ordering ramen), cha shu and egg were cold...
Wings were interesting - half wings styles, deep fried but soft .. wasnt hard or wasnt soft. Wasnt sure what to make of it... the batter was kaarage style and flavorful. Would i come back? Probably not because so many better options, service was the best thing they have going on for them... id rate them 2.5 ... but yelp only has full star ratings..."}
{"text":"Despite the weather, I still love eating ramen!

Here at Hakata Ramen, the seating is pretty tight and tiny. I believe we sat at the only \"big\" table which seated 6 people.

Greeted with welcome in Japanese, we took our seat and looked at the menu. Personally, I really enjoyed the decor of Hakata Ramen because it looked really unique compared to some of the other ramen places that I've been.

To be frank, the menu didn't have a huge selection, as they specialize in Tonkotsu ramen with only slight variations of it. However, they do offer more toppings for extra cost, shown in the back of the menu. You can also choose to have wavy or straight noodles for your ramen:) !
They also serve Ghost Peppers here, if you're willing to try that. I saw a video of someone eating ghost peppers and I am terrified of what it does....

We ordered a karaage to share and that came last among all our ramen. I really liked it!! It was crispy on the outside but tender meat was chewy on the inside. It was also prepped fresh as it was pipping hot when we got it.
I believe one of the sauce was mayonnaise, but I'm not sure what the red one was.

This was the original Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen! It came with corn, green onion, bean sprout, black mushrooms and char siew/pork belly.

I ordered the Red Hot Tonkotsu Ramen which was roughly the same, except they have a special homemade spicy sauce/paste and chili added towards the dish. The paste is seen on the spoon given, in that huge lump. I tried the paste before mixing it, and it tasted really bitter and horrid...
But after mixing the paste with the broth and it tasted great:) !

Most of us got wavy noodles, but I got straight noodles instead. & I actually like the straight noodles better because it was more firm compared to the wavy.

Hakata Ramen was tended by 1 server when we were there. He had to take orders, clean up, attend to cash as well as serve us the noodles when the time calls for it. Surprisingly, he spoke pretty good Japanese as well because we overheard a customer who interacted with him in Japanese and their conversation was flowing smoothly.
I actually enjoyed my time at Hakata Ramen. The ramen filled me up nicely as my dinner, and the broth was quite tasteful as well. I kind of wish they had more ramen choices as they only had about 5 options and maybe 2 don choices in their menu.

Nevertheless, I still enjoyed my time here, but I don't recommend going in a huge group!"}
{"text":"This ramen place was mediocre compared to the Kinton Ramen in the area. I still think the best ramen joints are downtown such as Kinton on Baldwin and Santouka Ramen.

Ambience: felt more like a bar with wooden tables and walls. Was not busy at all on a Thursday night and I guess that speaks for itself as most of the ramen fans are at Kinton down the street.

Food: I ordered the original Hakkada Tonkatsu and my sister ordered the Black Tonkatsu (sesame garlic flavour). I asked for less sodium and oil since most of the reviews suggested it. The broth for the original Tonkatsu was pretty bland lacking flavour and didnt like the noodles very much as they were thin and seemed like wonton noodles. Prefer the traditional thick ramen noodles.

Service: pretty decent, the waitress was friendly when asked to explain the different types of soup bases.

Overall, it was a less than average experience so likely wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight, came at around 5:30 before it got busy. I decided to try something new and ordered the black tonkotsu ramen with wavy noodles. So glad I got ordered it because the black garlic oil made it extra flavourful! Our orders came out fairly quickly too!"}
{"text":"Drumroll... ramen round two today. If I can enter the Yelp level will be at a 4.5 stars. Today I can actually do a direct comparison between this and the santotei down the street. Both are good, but I enjoyed the pork more here as it was more torched and thinly sliced and feels like fatty. There is a choice between wavy and straight noodles. The wavy one is pretty interesting and chewy. The spicy paste comes separately on the spoon and if you want egg, you have to pay extra to add. Overall it's another different experience to ramen as I find the broth less greesy."}
{"text":"I usually go to Kinton Raman as it's closer but decided to try this place out. I had the chasu lover Raman with extra spicy sauce. I enjoyed this much more than at Kinton. The broth is thicker, and more flavourful. I also had the beef tataki and it was OK, but not great. I came for the Raman so I don't mind. I'll come again despite the extra 15min drive. Lastly, when you walk in and see the niwaka mask, you know this is the real deal hakata place."}
{"text":"Average ramen. Was overly salty and noodles were a bit hard, the broth was okay but felt like it lacked something. I think best ramen still goes to sansotei."}
{"text":"Usually I come here for the lunch combo which nets you a ramen and a rice bowl. This time around I went at dinner for an appetizer to share with my SO and the cha-shu lover ramen seeing as their cha-shu topping simply melts in your mouth.  While it lands in my top 10 of ramen shops in TO, I'm having a tough time deciding whether or not it lands in my top 5. Nevertheless, great noodles, great broth, divine meat and really nice owners (owned by a husband and wife duo)! I always consider coming here when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Actually came here for the 1st time 6 months ago with husband. Both regular and black tonkotsu were good. I got extra (wavy) noodle and I think it's a good idea not only if you're hungry but also get more out of the broth.

Nice people operating the shop, but service is really slow. Sometime I'm really not sure why cooking a bowl of noodle could take so long. The group of 3 next to our table couldn't stand waiting for the noodles anymore and just paid for their gyoza and left. I'm glad I didn't ordered sides like fried chicken or something. That might be another half hour of waiting.

Taste wise, it's good, broth could be less salty though. It's a good choice for the North York area. However, I prefer Raijin downtown.

So today, despite the slow service last time, I brought a friend to try this place.

Unfortunately, they close between 3-5pm :( Bummer. We should have just stop into Kinton on the way up Yonge."}
{"text":"The level of time and care taken in the preparation of the ramen is evident from the the presentation all the way to the last spoon full. The thick rich broth,  perfectly cooked egg and melt in your mouth pork belly are sure put a smile on your face. Optional side include things such as black garlic and GHOST PEPPER (which is a must if you love spicy food).

The girl running the front desk was very attentive and welcoming. She made sure were well looked after and are enjoying the ramen that her husband in the kitchen crafted. From our conversation we found out that15h go into making of this excellent broth. 

Excellent little shop."}
{"text":"Service: friendly and prompt

Atmosphere: though for any age, music, free anime comics to read...suggest trend is for younger crowd but everyone is welcome. Watch my mom eat while sitting over the speaker as they were playing Japanese pop was interesting. ..

Food: broth okay but a bit salty for my taste. Would have liked more meat...only got two (ultra thin) slices of pork; daughter didn't like it because it was too fatty (so I guess I got 4 slices); Noodles just okay...had better; fried chicken bits were good; dumplings tasted store bought vs home made

Would I come back...sure but wouldn't go out of my way...

Side note: we came early when it opened and was able to get a seat easily but it is a popular restaurant so that must speak volumes for what others think...  this was just my opinion..."}
{"text":"Their ramen broth is out of this world. So fresh and home made.... The roux of the broth it's amazing as it sticks to the noodles so well. My favorite is the chasu lover!!!! I can't get enough of the well caramelized chasu."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to trying Hakata Ramen for the past month after walking by numerous times and seeing it was filled with people. I went this past Friday around 4:30 and waited 30 minutes not realizing it closes at 3 pm after the lunch crowd and reopens at 5 pm for the dinner crowd.

We ordered the Black Tonkotsu ($10.80 plus tax), the Chasu Lover ($14.50 plus tax), the Tantan Men ($15.00 plus tax) and dumplings ($3.80 plus tax) as well as the Agedashi Tofu ($4.80 plus tax) as appetizers. I'm only going to review the items I had which was the Black Tonkotsu and the two appetizers.

The Black Tonkotsu ($10.80 plus tax) came with the option of straight thin noodles or wavy thick noodles which I had the latter. Overall it was good but definitely not great. The pork was tender and flavourful with the right amount of fat. The noodles were slightly undercooked and the broth was good but it was a bit too salty for my liking.

The dumplings (5 for $3.80 plus tax) were okay nothing special and tasted more steamed than pan fried.

The Agedashi Tofu ($4.80 plus tax) were cooked perfectly but a little too much ginger for my liking.

The service was good but the food came out a little slow since there was only one cook working at that particular time.

Overall, it's a decent place for ramen nothing special. Also it's a little higher priced than it's competitors."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here after my recent trip to Japan but it didn't disappoint. Sure it wasn't the best ramen that I've had (compared to ones in Japan) but pretty on par with the better ones in Toronto. I had the black tonkotsu with soft boiled egg, smoked chashu and the octopus wasabi. 

The broth of the ramen was thick and creamy without feeling like it was too fatty. It was packed with flavours, without being too salty. So good. The soft boiled egg was also made right with the center just a little gooey!

The smoked chashu did have a Smokey flavour but wasn't that different from the chashu in the ramen. I personally would skip on this next time. But next time, I'm going to get an octopus wasabi just to myself.  The octopus wasabi was much better than the one at Nome! It had such a strong wasabi flavour and I loved it (coming from a wasabi lover)."}
{"text":"The food is just OK, the service less so. The space is uncomfortable but I get the feeling that they're doing what they can (with the exception of the stools at the window, which are _seriously_ uncomfortable). I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen with wavy noodles and a marinated egg as well as the Karage Don. The food came out quickly, but the service wasn't good - I drained my small water glass in the first 2-3 minutes of being seated and never got a refill. The most excitement I saw from our server was when he got to speak Japanese to a group of three who ordered alcohol - since I came with one other person and didn't order drinks, maybe we weren't as exciting.

The Karage Don was a tiny, tiny portion. It's $5.80 which must be like a 200% markup, because it's maybe 2 cups of rice, three pieces of chicken, spices, sauce, mayo, and green onions. The mayo and rice were really unappealingly sweet and the green onions tasted a smidgen soapy, as though they hadn't been washed/rinsed properly. The ramen was SO SALTY. The egg was flavorful but actually unpleasant to eat because of the saltiness. I finished maybe half the ramen because it was just unrelentingly salty, overwhelming the other flavors. The noodles were pretty good.

Overall, I would not come back or recommend this place. Average, maybe slightly worse."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen, though a little on the salty side. The broth is a little thicker than what I prefer but still a solid place to go for ramen. The takoyaki is quite good as well, very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I will be back :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving Hakata Ramen Shoryuken 3 stars because it seems they're really new to the game and I expect that they'll improve over time.

I first discover Hakata about a month ago while walking by and immediately noticed the \"shoryuken\" silhouette synonymous with Ken of Street Fighter fame.  Obviously, being a Street Fighter and Ramen fan, I was definitely excited about a new ramen joint opening up in my now newly adopted 'hood.

I went on a crisp Toronto Saturday afternoon, and upon walking in I immediately gravitated towards the seats closest to their kitchen over looking the restaurant.  Upon sitting I was instantaneously given a ice cold water (nice), but was also asked what I would like, which was rather odd considering I had only sat down for all of 10 seconds and hadn't dug into their menu yet.

I went with their standard Hakata Tonkotsu ramen, which goes for $9.80.  I waited for what seemed to be 10 minutes, and was served with a cool looking slanted ramen bowl.

The broth wasn't as rich or creamy compared to other ramen places I've been to that offer tonkotsu, such as Santouka, Kinton, Raijin and its ramen brethren.  Needless to say, it felt that it was lacking in a bit of \"soulful flavour\" and \"love\" if you will compared to the aforementioned ramen joints. That or maybe a some more salt. I'm not a ramen expert, but it paled in comparison to others.

Other than that, much like others who reviewed Hakata, their portions seemed much skimpier compared to the other establishments.  I was still hungry afterwards, which is never the case compared to the other ramen restaurants.  Also, something which I felt a bit off was their lack of combos, which clearly would have been a great upsell opportunity for them.  Maybe a bit of an oversight on their part, and hopefully their correct it, as I didn't feel compelled to pay $5.50 for their chasu don.

As I said, I'm giving this place 3 stars in the hopes they'll read this and take our feedback seriously as this place definitely has potential.  With Kinton Ramen 4 opening up down the street, they've got a hustling to do in order to keep up with the incumbents."}
{"text":"I thought this place was average. The portions could have been larger.  You can pay $2 more for extra noodles, which most people would have to do.  The ramen itself was different than most ramen places around Toronto, it was thinner in size and smoother, I liked it. They only have a couple of ramens to choose from, I wish there was more variety. The plus side about this place was that the broth wasn't overly infused with MSG and you get 10% off if you hashtag them on social media."}
{"text":"Came here once on a Friday night with some gals and we had a pleasant experience. Service was quick, friendly, and food was delicious and very presentable. Definitely recommend the egg salad fried chicken any day!"}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant when they were renovating from the old fried Korean chicken place.  From the outside, it looks simple but open concept where you can see the kitchen.

The ramen is quite good with thick tasty soup and fatty pork.  I ordered the bowl with extra pork but found it was more than enough.    Surprisingly that the soup was thick since I told the waitress to make it less salty.

They are in for some competition with another ramen place opening up today.  I was shocked that they actually ran out of ramen on the same day the other place was opening.  Either business was really good during the day or they miscalculated for dinner service.  Usually they are really busy so they must do a better job estimating how much how much to prepare.  Money lost on today's dinner service.  Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Best ramen I have tried in Toronto. Not as oily as the popular places located downtown, and broth that has actual flavor. Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"Their lunch combo is really good price. Broth seems bit weak but when you got tired about too oily thick broth, you will love Shoryuken broth. I'm not sure it's me or the broth that changed. But one day, I felt the broth is strong enough, but other day was bit weak. Overall, I would love to go this place when I miss Ramen."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me by one of my Japanese friends. She told me that this restaurant is owed by Japanese and the food is authentic.. So I gave it a shot.

I ordered the tatamen and I loved it! It tastes really good with thick ramen and a lot of minced meat. 

The only cons is that their portions are not that big so you definitely want to add either toppings or appetizers.. At the end it costs approx $20 pp."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out this ramen place!
The interior is really cool, it's all wooden and.. you know, it's different. You'll definitely notice it in comparison to all the other generic restaurants.
Service is really friendly, they greet and thank you. They're also pretty efficient, although when I went, the store was only half full. Don't know how they'd handle on a busy day.

The menu is pretty small for the main courses (ramen) - there's normal hakata ramen, black hakata, red chili and charshu? I tried the black one, and omg the broth is delicious! So rich and black garlic oil... mmm. Definitely good for a cheat day. Not a huge fan of the ramen noodles itself though, they're really thin even though they are texturized. The servings are not huge like kinton and each bowl is $10-11 each and you can add extra toppings.
Beer and drinks are not priced badly.

Will return.. once in a while."}
{"text":"The Red Hot Tonkotsu was absolutely delicious, and their Karaage was juicy and tender. Also, can't go wrong with a Street Fighter-inspired theme! Next time I'm in Toronto I will definitely make a point to come back and try more from their menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in uptown Koreatown near North York Centre station. I came here with a couple of friends on a cold Winter night. It's not a big restaurant so there isn't a whole lot of seating. It wasn't busy when we arrived on a weekday evening and it was also getting close to closing time. I ordered their Chasu Lover Ramen which has several pieces of chasu. It was a very delicious, generous portions of meat. Noodles were good and the broth was quite nice and too salty. I would definitely recommend getting I also ordered the chicken karaage which was quite delicious and had a nice crispy batter to it. Staff are super friendly and service was great. Overall, a nice little gem in Koreatown. Highly recommend for your ramen fix if you're in the area. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For a ramen house is not so good, broth are not flavorful like the way ramen should, noodles are not home made (taste n consistency like curly angel hair pasta). BUT, chasu is extraordinary, melt in your mouth soft and nicely flavored, so the star is all for that chasu."}
{"text":"Great, speedy and friendly service!  Food was really good too.  Had the regular and spicy ramen with an egg on the side.  Cooked to perfection!  Really flavourful broth.  Can't believe I've missed this place all this time.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hakata is one of my favourite ramen places by far! The broth isn't too heavy and creamy like other Ramen places I've tried, where you feel all greasy and salty afte.  I always get the Hakata Tonkastu and Beef Tataki - def recommend it !"}
{"text":"I think I have tried every ramen place here in the GTA. I live downtown, so whenever I come up, I usually get Konjiki ramen. Today I thought, why not try this place for a change? 

I waited at the front door for at least 5 minutes with nobody coming to seat me. The restaurant was quite empty and so I thought it was quite weird. After I was seated, I looked at the menu which had quite a few different items. 

I got the original tonkotsu ramen with an extra egg for $1.50. My bowl came really fast, and it came with the order of the guy sitting next to me; he seems to have been there for a bit. 

The noodles (thin) were really floury (like touhenboku's noodles) and the broth was quite greasy. The two pieces of chashu are both belly meat and had lots of fat. The egg was cooked just right. The portion was bigger than what I'd usually get at kinton. 

Overall, it was an average, quick meal. But if I came back up here, I would probably go to konjiki."}
{"text":"Having lived in Japan for a year, I have a pretty high standard for Ramen places in Toronto since the amount of $ it cost for Ramen in this city is grossly over priced even when compared to Japan and their much higher living standard.  

I've been meaning to check out Hakata for almost 3 years and finally dropped in with my wife and ordered;

1. Shio Ramen
2. Gyoza
3. Mini Slow cooked / braised pork don

My #1 policy in all ramen places that i visit for the first time is to order the simplest bowl of Ramen, which in most cases would be Shio ramen.  I believe this is the perfect way to really evaluate the quality/taste of the original broth.  When you receive your bowl, don't attack the noodles right away but just grab a spoon and take in a spoonful of soup with your eyes closed.   This will explain much of the bowl of that ramen before you even dabble with the noodle.  If the broth is good, it can cover alot of other short coming such as lacking quality of noodles, and other toppings.  

First of all, Gyoza was frozen, pre-packaged ones.  I make gyoza from scratch from time to time so it was disappointing for me.  And the place isn't all that clean.  There is a corridor that leads to the back of the resto where the bathrooms are situated.  When you go to the bathroom, the kitchen is on the right hand side and you can see part of the kitchen and it is kinda filthy.  Also, the cook with super dirty aprin came out couple of times to serve food until additional evening server arrived and it wasn't pleasant especially after seeing the state of the kitchen was in on my way and back to/from the bathroom.

Then the mini-don came out. That was the best dish and it was slightly better than average.  Then finally the shio ramen came out. *game over music*.  Very disappointed with sub-par flavoured broth and soft/un-chewy noodles just did it for me and i will NOT return to Hakata.  IMO, Santouka / Ryus are top notch but still yet to have tried Isshin and Ryoji.  Kinton's way over-rated yet Sansotei was pretty decent.  I would rate Hakata to be at the very bottom of this roaster."}
{"text":"The broth is rich and full of flavour. However I found the noodles really hard. The amount of ingredients other than.noodles is minimal and the additions are expensive."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place with my date for a late night dinner. I found the interior very cute. There is a little corner with English and Japanese manga/magazines and ear the window there is cute step stools as chairs. Some people complained that the seating isn't very comfortable, but I found it fine. Granted, they were not super comfy but I had no complaints nor issues with it. 

My date ordered the chasu lover ($13) and I got the tonkotsu ramen + an egg ($9.80+$1.50) both with wavy noodles and an order of karage to share ($4.50). We both really enjoyed the ramen a lot!!!! The broth was a nice change from normal tonkotsu and it was a little richer but the bean sprouts cut through it very nicely. The karage was very good as well and I loved the spicy miso paste that went with it! It is not battered so it is lighter and had a very nice mouth feel. However, it was a little soggy."}
{"text":"They actually make pretty good ramen, place is small but clean. Parking is a bit tricky because you have to park on street and it's like $3 per hour for parking. I would recommend it to everyone who likes ramen tho."}
{"text":"?????????????????----??????????????????????12????11?45????d?lunch?????????????????????????????????????????????????d?????????????????????????????????????cash or debit."}
{"text":"Great Ramen place, the service is very friendly and quick. The tonkotsu is very good! They often have deals on Sapporo with the purchase of an app."}
{"text":"Was actually delicious--a little greasy/oily but nonetheless delicious. BUT, my wife and I both ended up with some food poisoning. 

About 2 hours after eating, my wife started throwing up and then my stomach started gurgling. I have it a little more time; maybe my wife was just sick for some reason. Then it was my turn. 

Really too bad. I wanted to like this place as tonkotsu ramen is one of my favourite dishes on the planet after having lived in Kanto for three years."}
{"text":"Mmmm fabulous ramen. The broth was very good and all the ingredients complimented one another. It's bit annoying at how you have to pay \"extra\" to add an egg or any other toppings and you only get 2 thinly slices of beef unless you want to pay more. Besides that, great ramen and nice wait staff! Overall, I'd visit again."}
{"text":"One of the lessor known spots for ramen in the GTA. I would recommend this place with those who enjoy Kinton + Sansotei. 

My usual order is a Hakata Tonkotsu ramen, which includes all your fixings (Chashu, noodles, green onions, black fungus), with an egg for an extra few dollars (this is not right). For those who are feeling extra hungry, the chashu lover offers 6 pcs of chashu. The broth is a clear winner as it is rich, umami, and creamy; everything you would expect with a classic ramen broth. 

What I enjoy, and choose to visit over the other popular chains, is the time to service and the sidemenu. My go-to shared plate would be the karaage. Good batter, chicken is both tender and juicy, and the mayo sauce is well balanced with heat and creaminess. 

Check it out for lunch specials or an evening happy hour as well."}
{"text":"On this fine, wet and windy weekend - I had a chance to check this ramen joint that I've had my eyes on ever since they were under construction. The Yonge/Finch area are full of eateries and Hakata is one of the latest ramen joints in the area.

The menu is simple, basic and features all of the popular ramen choices that were similar to the other ramen joints nearby.  For the evening, I had the red hot tonkatsu ramen.  The broth was thick and somewhat creamy, but despite the description of it being a spicy ramen, the miso hot sauce actually came in a spoonful with the ramen so you can decide how hot you want your ramen to be.  Such a simple thing, yet so ingenius!  Nursing a canker sore in my mouth, I could only tolerate a bit of spicyness at this time and it was a welcome feature to be able to control the level of spicyness.   

The soup was flavorful, and aromatic.  It was not overly salty in the beginning until you got to the bottom of the broth, just like other ramen joints.  The noodles were thin however, and unlike at some other ramen joints, you do not have a choice of what kind of noodles you can order.  My ramen came with 2 very thinly sliced pieces of pork belly, very thin that I thought they were like paper thin!  I was hoping for more without having to pay extra.  I've had ramen with thicker pieces of pork belly before at other ramen restaurants! 

We had also ordered a side of pan fried gyoza, which were very under cooked.  They tasted more like steamed than fried as they were very soft and mushy to bite into.  This could have been better, but at $3.50 for 5 pieces it is quite the value, if they could only fry it a little longer.

Despite it's flaws, I would come back at least to try the other items on the menu.  They have weekday specials such as $4.50 Sapporo on tap on Tuesdays to Thursdays with your order of ramen!

Service was quick and attentive, given the very small size of the restaurant, making it hard for the friendly staff to miss you wanting to get their attention.  Hakata is a fresh, welcoming addition to the Willowdale area!"}
{"text":"Just finished my ramen and am thoroughly satisfied. I had the black tonkotsu and I love garlic, so I really enjoyed it. Great pork. Fast service. Clean."}
{"text":"Overpriced for small ass portion.  I rather go buy a ramen from next store h mart and make it at home."}
{"text":"TLDR Version:  Serious hygiene issue.  Great atmosphere inside. Food itself is hit or miss depending on how burnt your meat is.

My first time here in Hakata Shoryuken Ramen.  The interior is amazing and provides a truly authentic experience.  So much wood everywhere, even the air conditioner evokes a sense of Japanese atmosphere.  

This place takes credit cards.  Has a lunch special for $13 every Monday to Friday from noon to 3 pm.  The lunch special consists of their regular Ramen and a choice of either Karage (fried chicken) rice or Chashu (thinly sliced pork belly) rice.

The size of both is good for its price.  

The ramen's broth is surprisingly not too salty, but it's thick and you can definitely taste the fat which gives the broth its flavour.  I didn't regret the choice of wavy noodles either.  Although the Chashu provided were only two pieces, not a satisfying prospect. 

The Chashu itself was burnt which significantly hurts the flavour as the carbonized taste overpowers the richness of the pork belly's flavour.

The Karage also was burnt, and similarly impacted negatively the taste.  More care must be put into these things as it does really mask the taste that dish is intended to have!

There wasn't much interaction with the waitress.  Aside from the food being brought to you, you do everything on your own.  There's even a pitcher of water for you to pour for yourself. 

Two red flags in my experience here.

First.  A customer knocked down the jar containing spoons and chopsticks onto the floor.  The waitress goes and puts the contents right back into the jar instead of taking it back to get it washed.  That's not a great feeling, knowing that customers later will be using spoons and chopstick that has been on the floor, where customers walked around god knows what.

Second.  Not even a greetings on the way in and a goodbye on the way out.  That's not really great customer service, especially when a restaurant is trying to replicate the Japanese experience.  My relatives in Japan would probably find this rude."}
{"text":"They are without a doubt the best tasting Hakata ramen in Toronto. Their soup base is really thick and delicious, part owner Takuma tells me their broth requires 15hrs to complete, and it certainly tastes like so. Their Chasu is absolutely amazing, much better than others around the same area. If you are around NY area, I truly recommend them without any hesitation."}
{"text":"Yum! I used to think I hated Ramen but I think that's just because my first and last ramen experience was at Ajisen. Don't go to Ajisen...come here instead.

The broth reminded me a lot of pork pone soup broth. It tastes just like pork bones, thick and marrow-ey. I think that's why it's so oily on top of the fatty chasu juices, but I don't mind it. I love me some grease!  

I got the chasu lovers. It was loooaded with mean for $13 bucks. If you want to add other stuff like kimchi (how Japanese of you...), egg (get the egg. trust meeee), sprouts, extra meat or noodles you do that once you order the basic ramen bowl.

There are 4 choices for bowls. Regular, black garlic oil, spicy, and regular with crazy amount of meat. In this order they increase in price. The egg was either $1.50 or $2 bucks but I definitely got two. They need a special machine/temperature or something to cook it according to my friend Eve W. so I wanted to take full advantage. I also got it spicy, which means it came with a spoon full of red pepper paste. On second thought, I should have probably brought my own from home to sneak it into the bowl...cuz it's a dollar extra.
The egg was amazing. The center is sooooooo gooey and soft and just ugh. I want to eat those eggs errydayyy fo lyfe. 

I also had the karaage (fried chicken). It was really soft and yummy, but small portion. It comes with a plop of mayo and a tiny plop of hot sauce, which I suspect is just red pepper paste. 

I would definitely come here again!! I may have gained 10lbs from that broth though, just fyi."}
{"text":"Quite easily the *thickest* and *creamiest* ramen broth. The setting is laid back and Street Fighter love abounds the walls. The only draw back is their limited buisness hours compared to other ramen places, but all the more reason to try them out if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"As someone who used to live in Japan for a whole four years and still pays regular visits to there despite settling down in TO, I find this Sho Ryu Ken Hataka Ramen place truly stands for its reputation and aspiration as one of the most genuine and hearty Japanese noodles restaurants in town. Having visited almost every single local Japanese noodles place, I cannot but marvel at Sho Ryu Ken's ability to renew the memory of my taste bud, which has been duly attuned since I was student in Oita, Japan, not far away from Hakata, Japan. I went to this place for the first time with three friends who all at one point of their lives, lived in Japan. After having tried our respective order, we were in full agreement that this ought to be ranked at least as a top 3 Japanese noodle place in the GTA. The particular one of my choice was the Chashu (bbq pork) noodle, the portion of which was considerably larger in comparison to other Ramen places (a plus of course). The soup base is Tonkotsu, which means pork bone and thus speaks for strong salty flavor and thickness. I topped it up with a seasoned egg (aji tama) and red ginger (which is not often offered at any other ramen place in own, but is a popular side order in Japan). Yet the most amazing thing about this ramen is its many slices of pork belly sitting on top. Richly seared, well-flavored and thinly cut, it was tender and succulent, definitely an unforgettable treat to my tongue, something which I thought I can only get to taste when in Japan, not any restaurant here in Toronto. After finishing everything, I couldn't help but order some more soup with a new bowl of noodle (kaetama). Although I'm not a big fan of high carbohydrate intake, yet for the sake of this Sho Ryu Ken's Chashu Ramen, I thought it was well worth it. If you are like me, who is into Japanese Ramen restaurant and is only enthusiastic to the most authentic type of Japanese noodle, why bother yourself with the perennially long waiting-line outside Kinton, which is just a few steps away, just come to Sho Ryu Ken for a real treat!"}
{"text":"Hakata Ramen is a boutique-sized ramen place with excellent service. 
The waitress who served us was very friendly :)

Shoryu Wings 4/5
I loved this! So much flavour - I'd prefer more meat but I guess this is how they want to marinate their wings.

Black Tonkotsu 3/5
The broth wasn't too oily - which we all preferred. I'd recommend this broth out of all the broths that were offered (I tried my friends' noodles hahaha)

Agedashi Tofu 3/5

Beef tataki 1/5
I didn't like this at all.. :S"}
{"text":"The broth is excellent, and with the availability of kaedama (extra noodles for $2), it's even better. I like getting the chasu lover with an egg, black garlic oil and ghost pepper on the side."}
{"text":"Can't miss this place. It's located on Yonge and Churchill/Church in North York. The store front is outfitted with wooden panels. I went for lunch on a weekday, it wasn't packed. Filled with students from the area? They have 6 seating along the window and regular tables that can seat 4. 

The ramen was alright. Didn't like how an egg is an add-on item. They are also skimpy on the chasu but it did melt in your mouth! Broth was pretty hearty as well! I had the regular tonkotsu and the base of the broth reminded me of the ramen I ate at ramen stadium in Fukuoka. However this place adds like soya sauce? The broth was way too dark. I guess every chef has their interpretation on ramen. Give this place a try, its definitely one of the better places in North York. But I don't think I'll return anytime soon because I prefer Kinton down the street more."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Hakata 'cause it was quite different from the other ramen I've had!

Hakata Tonkotsu - not too heavy. 
Tried thin noodles for the first time - pretty good and firm. The wavy noodles are not that thick either. 
Comes with 2 pieces flavorful cha siu, green onions, bean sprouts,  wood ear. No egg!

Red Hot Tonkotsu - comes with a spoon of hot sauce, added 1/2 and was quite red hot for me!!

Gyoza - juicy and flavorful with a thin soft wrapping 

Service was pretty friendly, but he forgot the extra noodles, either that or you're supposed to order it as a refill."}
{"text":"This is the best ramen places I have been to up north in uptown. I would rate it higher than Kinton, since its noodles are more cooked and the meat is more tender than Kinton's. What we got this time are Black Tonkotsu and Red Hot Tonkotsu. The ramen menu is small but they have a lot more appetizers. 

How I judge with my ramen are usually as follows:
1. Egg: 5/5
- The egg is nicely cooked, and the egg white has just enough chewiness but still remained extremely tender. The yolk is nice and runny, the edge of it is not solidified unlike a couple of restaurants I have been to before. 

2. Noodle: 4.5/5
- Now, the noodle they serve with the ramen is straight noodles. What this means is, it's intended to slide down your throat faster rather than the wrinkled noodles. The purpose of wrinkled noodles is to soak up more soup and is more flavourful (for example, like the ones they serve at Santouka).
- The noodles are more cooked than the ones they serve in Kinton, and slides nicely along with the soup down the throat. It is not as flavourful nor soft as the ones served in Santouka, but it gives enough chewiness that the wrinkled noodle does not have. 
- I personally am more of a wrinkled noodle fan, but I find the noodle here very nicely cooked and more \"as one\" than the ones I have had downtown. For straight noodles, it's gooooood. 

3. Meat: 10/5
- Yepp, you saw it right, 10/5. It is just simply amazing. The meat melts on the pallet due to the fatty richness it has, and it is really tender and the meat itself is not overly thin. 

4. Soup: 4/5
- The soup base is a little salty and greasy in my opinion. The soup is nice and rich, but salty to the taste. It is drinkable, but make sure you are drinking water at the same time. 

Appetizer: \"Age Dashi Tofu\": 3.5/5
- Think of this...as Takoyai but with Deep fried tofu. The sauce is amazing, and the dried bonito flakes are delicious. The tofu itself is a little bland, so you might want to dip it in the sauce when you eat it.

Service: 4/5
- Service was a little slow. But I don't blame the poor waiter/manager/cook. Yep, it's a 3-in-1 package we got. We went there before the dinner rush so the restaurant is quite dead (only one other table besides us), but we were not greeted when we entered until the guy looked up from his phone. The dinner service was rather fast so no complaints. 

Overall impression:
Food: 5/5
Service: 4/5

Will definitely go there again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I actually really like the food here, especially the ramens, beef tataki and karrage. 

However, they seem to always run out of food. Perhaps it's a sign they are really really good but if you go, go before 7:30 pm. Or you will probably get told 90 pct of the items  on the menu are sold out. 

Good service and cozy spot. Also, no parking. Don't park in the back because the spots are own by HMart and the servers will warn you, you may get ticketed or towed."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best Ramen in North York. I have tried most of the offerings in the GTA and this place is consistent and delicious. Soup is flavorful and noodles are nice and chewy. The cha siu is one of the best anywhere. This place is just a few steps from the bland Kinton where there is always a line up."}
{"text":"I love going out for ramen and this was definitely one of my favourites! My friend took me here as it was one of the ramen places from Japan and it was her favourite while she lived there so I was excited to try! 

Great service - we squeezed in at 2:30 when they were closing at 3pm to prep for dinner service but we didn't feel rushed or urged to leave at all though we left accordingly! They were really polite and let us eat at ease! Friendly server as well - my friend and I were fascinated by their tech for seating (long story) and he explained to us how it worked and such! My friend even had a nice conversation with him about Japan as he had stayed at her hometown when he had visited the country.

The food was really good too! I got the lunch menu and my friend got the tantan men and everything was really good! There's nothing better than delicious authentic made ramen from the heart! They have lots of topping choices as well so I felt excited to try different additions.

Love love loved this place. Will definitely be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"This ramen place is by far the worst I've been to in Toronto.  At first when I sat down and look at the chopstick and spoon, it was dirty.  I order the Hakata ramen.  Each additional topping is at least $1.5 extra.  The ramen doesn't even come with an egg or nori.  You have to pay extra for it.  I got the egg for $1.5 and it was over cooked.  The ramen came with 4 paper thin slices of cha siu.  The broth was rather plain and the noodles was average.  The food was dirty cuz after I finished, I was looking for washroom.  What a disappointment.  Hakata suppose to have one of the best ramen but this one is not Hakata ramen."}
{"text":"Hakata ramen really hit the spot when my wife and I had a ramen craving. We were a bit disappointed with our experience with kinton ramen (Markham location) and were pleasantly surprised by this place.

The ramen came out quick and hot, very decent sized portions and quite tasty. The noodles had a nice chew and bounce (am dante) and went well with the toppings. The cha shu was large and nicely seasoned with a light torched flavor, though a tad fattier then I would like. I ordered a soy egg on the side which was quite salty. It tasted like it was seasoned with heavy soy sauce, though presentation  wise it was well done. We also had the karage on the side which was excellent for the price point. Large juicy pieces, nice and crispy tough the side sauces were very \"meh\". It was like a side of korean hot pepper paste and some miracle whip, neither of which did much to enhance the flavor. It would have been nice if it was a wasabi mayo or mustard mayo.

The booth seating was actually excellent as well. Lots of space with everything we needed in front of us (jug of water, cutlery, napkins) and there was lots of space.

Overall a very pleasant experience, I would give it more a solid 3.5 then a 4, but still good none the less"}
{"text":"Pretty decent ramen with a great lunch combo and delicious pork chashiu, however I wouldn't recommend the beef tataki over here as it didn't seem fresh and reliable."}
{"text":"Small and cozy on the inside.

Chashu Lover $13 - comes with 7 thin slices of pork meat. The meat was soft and tender and very tasty. Added boiled egg for $1.50. Noodles were the thin type. I rather the noodles be a bit more thick. The broth was okay. Overall a pretty good ramen place.

Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"authentic interior & feel - light-hued wood all around with japanese decorations.  hakata tonkotsu ramen is good stuff.  creamy, salty, porky.  i got it with the original noodles which had a fun and chewy texture to them.  the roast pork slices are large and generous, and they have lots of fat which gives tons of flavour!  very affordable at $11.  i would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"Average ramen, soup base was too salty, most likely will not return. My bf ordered the red spicy one for $1 more and was given a spoonful of sauce that was more salty than spicy. It was quite disappointing.

We also ordered a beef tataki that came after my bf was done his bowl of ramen. It was good, nothing special, the plate was quite watery.

Service was excellent and place was clean. Kinton is down the street, I much prefer and recommend Kinton instead."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic ramen experience delivered with real care and attention, then this is the place.

The broth is thick and full of flavour. The egg is cooked perfectly, and the pork melts in your mouth. The optional ghost pepper topping added a nice kick!

Why settle for half assed ramen elsewhere when you can find this level of quality at a reasonable price! Best of all, there's parking across the street at metro."}
{"text":"Had the chasu lover... Honestly felt like i could ate another 3 more after having one. Super satisfying! They also offer a buy 9,  get one free loyalty club card. Definitely will be coming back again and trying the other dishes."}
{"text":"The good: $13 lunches are pretty good. Comes with a good portion of food....

The bad: but unfortunately the food here isn't great. First the karaage done. It wasn't too bad, but it wasn't the greatest dish either. Was not juicy, but at least it was hot and a bit fried. It did not have much of a taste to it (aside from the chicken taste). And the rice itself was meh. The ramen noodle itself was decent too. 

The ugly: however bad the karaage don was, the ramen here was worse. The soup was heavy (I didn't finish the broth which doesn't mean a good thing..) and the chashu was so fattening it actually made me cringe a bit (coming from a meat lover). 

Neutral: service itself was good, didn't have to wait for a table. Good location. I just didn't enjoy the broth and meat which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"My second time coming here since their grand opening so I believe its time to finally give me first review !

For dinner, I tried the black tonkatsu (around $12) and the tan tan men red spicy (around $14) and a side of katsudon with rice (around $5). Both with wavey ramen instead of straight 

Black Tonkatsu - This both came quite warm and I was expecting the wavey ramen to be abit thicker but it came in a thinner consistency than I am used to. The broth was definitely rich and there was not an overwhelming amount of bean sprouts which I am not a fan of seeing at the regular ramen joints nowaday. However, as I began eating this bowl.. I felt that the broth seemed to get a little too strong for my liking. Could not drink the soup after finishing the ramen unfortunately. The quality of the Cha siu was good but the 2 slices was not enough as it seemed that one of the slices seemed quite small so I guess I only got 1.5 slices of meat in this bowl. 

Tan Tan Men  - I was hoping that this bowl of ramen would be more spicy or at least had a bit of a kick in the broth but it was not spicy whatsoever (I am actually sensitive to spiciness). I've tried desperately adding the red chili pepper powders served on the side ....but it didnt help relief my spicy cravings. The flavour of the ground beef had a hint of sweet marinade and well garnished garlic flavour which I enjoyed. Unfortunately I was hoping for abit more in this bowl of ramen as the price of this was quite steep. Again the thickness and heaviness of the broth was too overwhelming to allow drinking afterwards. 
I felt quite thirsty after this meal. 

Katsudon - There was a total of 4 bit sized slightly larger than popcorn chicken katsus ontop of a bed of rice garnished with scallions and kupie mayo (amazing). The ratio between protein and rice was roughly 1/5 so I ended up eating rice with the remaining overpowering leftover soup which was not something I was expecting but it was alright.....certainly not worth the price of $5.5. The katsu was nicely cooked where the outside was crispy and the inside was still moist which I appreciated. 

Conclusion- Hakata has all the ingredients to become a strong contender in a competitive ramen neighbourhood in North York but I felt that they did not offer enough for the price that they charge ($40 after tax and tips). It is a shame to see less and less ramen joints offering the egg without extra charge. Nonetheless, the store was clean and the service was good. 

I hope they are prepared for more competition as more and more ramen joints are appearing every month. I am looking forward to seeing Sansotei Ramen come in this neighbourhood as they offer competitive fair price and portions for their meals. 

Please note that they do not accept Amex :("}
{"text":"Just dropped by for a quick dinner. My friend and I both ordered the original dish with an extra egg. It was so meh. A bit tasteless actually. The egg was def refrigerated as the yolk was hard and cold. Also ordered the chicken karage (sp?) and it was a bit too oily and bland for my taste. The servers were very sweet which I appreciated but I will not return as the food was nothing memorable."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Hakata Ramen is probably one of your best choices for ramen in North York, although I do know many who still go to Kinton just down the street. I've been to both places this past week, and I do think Kinton has a busier crowd compared to Hakata. Either way, they're both ramen places serving somewhat different styles of ramen.

Hakata has a nice Japanese feel with its exterior and interior, as shown by its bamboo decorations. The restaurant isn't that big, but that's normal with many of the ramen joints in the city. We were seated immediately and had menus on the table already when arrived.

I've visited Hakata once before, but held off on writing a review as I felt my lukewarm broth that time was a one-off experience. This time I decided to order a Hakata Tonkotsu with a beef tataki on the side. I noticed they added a thin ramen and wavy ramen option recently, and since I like my ramen chewy I decided to go with wavy ramen.

This place was a little slow in preparing your order, but eventually the beef tataki came first, followed by my bowl of ramen. The beef tataki was sliced very thin, so I definitely give the chef credit for perfecting that technique. The beef itself was very good as well as the ponzu sauce, and in some cases I wrapped the beef with the green onions inside.

As for the ramen, the attraction for this place was the chashu, and believe it or not the green onions. This place does not skimp out on its green onions, and the chashu, although thin cut, was still juicy and delicious. The broth, however, was not rich enough for my liking, and the wavy ramen was decent but not overwhelming (I like my ramen thicker and rounder...see Sansotei's thick ramen for the style I like). For $9.80, it is in the lower end of ramen prices, so I think 3 stars is a fair rating overall.

Service was overall very good, and it was easy to wave down a server when I needed service. For North York standards, Hakata does its job and I would return if I'm nearby, but there are better places out there in the city."}
{"text":"This is one of many ramen shops around the North York area. I've come by a couple of times for their lunch special, which lets you get a ramen and a small rice bowl for about $15 or so?

They offer a choice of thin or wavy noodles. The only issue I have is that the soup base is way too fat, and I've gotten stomach issues after eating it. The chicken karaage rice is also crunch and very flavourful, a great side dish to eat with the noodles, but it's a bit of a carb overload!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of this ramen restaurant.  The soy eggs were incredibly salty. I got the spicy Tonkotsu and I was not impressed by the broth. Maybe I need to try the other types? However, compared with other restaurants with a similar soup base, this would be my least favourite. We also ordered the fried chicken but it wasn't worth it because they provide very few and small pieces. 

The atmosphere is casual. Has a few window seats but the stools there are very high in comparison to the table. The service was typical, nothing out of the ordinary but not too slow either. I noticed that sometimes when the waitress is busy, the chef will bring out the bowls of noodles himself. That's good because then the noodles won't get cold and soak up all the broth.

All in all, I wasn't too impressed; however, maybe I just went on a bad day. I might decide to try this again since it's close to home."}
{"text":"Walked by Hakata a couple of times and always noticed there was a huge crowd there but no line ups like Kinton would have. Was curious about how it tasted, so we decided to go with Hakata instead of Kinton this time. The restaurant is small but it does have many tables with four seats and even some bar tables along the wall for people who want to eat alone. The decor looks very traditional with wooden boards nailed onto the walls. The service is really good at this restaurant and even though the waiter forgot to bring us water, when he noticed it, he immediately brought us water and gave us an apology. 

Our party of three ordered: 
Beef Tataki (~$5.00 forgot the exact price) - The beef was sliced super thin but it was still really good.
Pan-fried Dumplings (~$3.80 forgot the exact price)  - Really good, I recommend this dish. 
Hakata Tonkotsu ($9.80 according to their website) -  Ordered the straight noodle option. Really enjoyed the broth, it was super light and it wasn't heavy at all. Also ordered the extra noodles for $2. What was different about this place compared to Sansotei, Hokkaido, and Kinton is that they give you the extra noodles separately AFTER they give you the first bowl of ramen. I don't really like this because I don't want to have to add noodles while I'm eating the ramen to begin with. I would've appreciated if they added more noodles in my order before serving it to me. 
2 Black Tonkotsu ($10.80 each according to their website)  - My friends claimed that the broth was light but the black garlic oil really complemented the ramen. 

Overall, I had a good experience at Hakata, I would come again if I am ever in the area. The broth wasn't salty and I wasn't thirsty by the end of it, which I really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Nothing mindblowing but this place has pretty decent ramen. The atmosphere is casual with a couple of small tables and seats along the side of the wall.

I had originally wanted to try the Tantan ramen because it is made with sesame sauce but unfortinately it is only offered on Tues to Fri. The menu is not too extensive with only a few options to choose from so I decided to try the Black Tonkotsu ramen with wavy noodles (you can pick straight noodles which are the thin and traditional ones as well).

Overall the presentation of the ramen was okay. It came with two slices of chasu which were somewhat fatty yet tasty, soft, and flavourful. The broth could be creamier but it was still decent and not too salty. The texture of the wavy noodles was just right amount of thickness and chewiness.

The service was friendly and prompt.
Overall a decent, casual place to try if you are craving for a hot meal or just ramen in general"}
{"text":"Great food great ramen but with little portion. Can't feed myself enough with that amount of food. Service is great!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying to place after it's initial soft opening.  Hakata is probably my best bet for ramen in North York.

Pros:
Very good ramen
Good service

Cons:
Parking can be tough to find

I came to Hakata during it's soft opening weekend.  My thoughts at the time was that the ramen was just so so and the portions were rather small because of the bowls they were using.  They have since rectified both and I'm very happy for it.

Let's get right into the ramen shall we.  Hakata only does tonkotsu ramen.  They have a couple of varieties of it but they won't have your usual miso, shio, shoyu types you may see at other places.  That being said, they do a very good job at it.  The broth was very rich and not to salty at the end.  You have your choice between traditional thin noodles are thicker wavy noodles.  If you ask me, go with the thicker noodles.  You get two slices of chasiu pork with every order unless you get the chasiu lovers ramen which come with 7!!  The chasiu is thinly sliced so if you like your chasiu, you might want to order more of it.  We also ordered a karaage side dish which was very wonderfully done.  It was crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside.  

The service here was very good.  There was only one waitress when we came in on a saturday afternoon which was quite strange if you ask me.  However, the kitchen staff also were helping out and service was quite quick.  The staff were all pretty nice and friendly.  Going to ramen places with out little one can be quite tough but it was a very good experience and I will have no qualms about coming back with her in the future.

Being on Yonge Street, the parking can be quite tricky.  If all the spots are taken on Yonge Street, it can be quite difficult to find parking.  I have been told before there's parking in the back but there are only a couple of spots at most and some of them say reserved for the H mart next door.  We drove around a couple times before a spot opened on the street.

All in all, Hakata is my go to place for Ramen in North York.  The downtown ramen shops are still my fav, but having one near where I am helps as well."}
{"text":"I visited Hakata Ramen with a friend on a Sunday night. We arrived at around 6:30 p.m., and half of the tables were already occupied. This place is great for small groups of four people or less. In fact, they have a lot of tables for groups of four. When we arrived, all the tables for two were already taken, so we sat at the bar table. I thought the bar table would be pretty inconvenient, but there is a ledge in front of you where you could put your jacket and other belongings.

My friend and I didn't feel too adventurous, so we just decided to try the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (which was the cheapest ramen). I had the straight noodles option (thin noodles), and I thought that they were delicious. However, I actually prefer noodles with a chewier texture, so the wavy option (thicker noodles) would've probably been better. The reason I chose the straight noodles is because I prefer eating thinner noodles. However, I felt that the texture of the straight noodles was not really on par with the thin noodles that other restaurants in downtown Toronto offer. I was a bit disappointed that an egg was considered an extra $1.50. Even though the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen is cheaper than ramen from other restaurants, I would have preferred it if the egg was included. 

Overall, I liked the ramen regardless because the broth was very light. This is very uncommon for ramen restaurants since the broth is usually heavy, even given a light option (such as Kinton Ramen). Also, I felt like the meat melts in your mouth; the texture was amazing. If you're a big eater, you should order extra noodles though. I was not completely full after my meal.

The service was very good especially since the server came around often with a water jug. I almost never ran out of water before the server came back. In addition, the food came pretty quickly (around 10-15 minutes).

I would certainly come back to Hakata if I'm around this area of North York. However, I still prefer the ramen from the downtown Toronto locations more."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today as I was tired of Ajisen and boy am I pleased! First off the broth is very flavourful and not too salty. You can really taste layers of flavour. Secondly, the noodles are amazing. They're quite thin but super flavourful, they really soak up the flavour of the broth. Third- the meat!!!!! The meat, or pork belly, is absolutely amazing, delicious, and tender with a melt-in-your mouth consistency. Overall the ramen here is excellent. The staff are super friendly and one of the owners gave me a full history of ramen in Japan, she was so pleasant and kind. The prices are average, the appetizers are simple but yummy as well and they have a great deal with Sapporo beer. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place.   Located conveniently next to me, this is an quaint place that opened a few years ago.  The owner is actually the chef from Japan.   There is a big ryu inside there on the wall and japanese magazines inside.  Not sure if people actually read them.

I remember a few years ago when they opened, it was a total disappointment. The portions were small and the food was ok.

A few years later, I decided to give them another chance and I came back again.  This time, the ramen was amazing.  There is something great and amazing about the broth.

My usual order is the tonkotsu broth.  I measure how good the ramen is just by drinking the broth.  The broth is rich and tasteful.   I can tell that the chef put a lot of hours each day just to make the broth.   Absolutely delicious tonkotsu broth.   Others may disagree, but I like the ramen here.

The key to enjoying japanese ramen is to drink their broth when you finish the ramen.   Don't forget, the tonkotsu broth takes many hours to make.

I will be coming here again soon.  Love their tonkotsu ramen broth."}
{"text":"Maybe the worst Ramen place I have been to in a while.  If they don't know how to crisp up fried chicken,  make spicy Ramen spice,  make flavourful broth then how do they call themselves a Ramen shop and don't get me started on the chincy portions of poorly cooked noodles.  

I brought my buddy here as a thank you meal and I may now owe him two meals,  one as an apology for this one. 

One last classy touch,  this five star establishment thinks they can charge $7 for a half pint.  Imagine what they will charge once they learn how to cook.

If I could I would give this place negative stars."}
{"text":"Yummm!! Loved the ramen here! 
Opted for their standard ramen with wavy noodles and got the complementary egg when mentioning yelp. Really delicious
The broth was nice and rich, the noodles perfectly chewy, and the chashu has a yummy smoky flavour to it (even though I didn't order the smoky flavoured one??). 
The only thing I wish was different was the amount of chashu offered. They served the standard 2 pieces but they were sooooo thin so it hardly lasted me the whole meal. 
I did see a \"chashu lover\" menu item which apparently includes 7 pieces of chashu for $15 so I may just get that next time I'm feeling like splurging. 
My favourite spot for ramen in North York has been Sansotei so far but my great first experience will definitely have me back here as a regular!"}
{"text":"Sensotei was the standard in Toronto for me...until I try this place. We ordered the fried chicken nuggets and tofu for apps, and they do not disappoint. 
The tofu was mixed with vegetable before being deep fried. It was light, taste like chicken, and their house sauce just take it up a notch. The nuggets were so moist it was just prefect.
We have the regular Ramen, and the soup was just right. Rich in flavour but not salty at all. They got us the traditional Ramen by mistake but it was just fine. We will just have to come back to try the wavy ones. We don't mind at all."}
{"text":"Saw the sign hakata when i was walking by. A week later, I brought my japanese friend to see how authentic the ramen is. Sadly, the ramen was terrible. I chose the thick noodles with extra chashu. The chashu melted in the soup instead of my mouth due to how thin the slices are, and the likelihood it was expired. The soup base was full of msg, you can practically taste the chicken powder. The only redeeming feature was the noodles itself, and they were just mediocre. The marinated egg was bad as well and did not taste anything like it was supposed to.
The reason for 2 stars is mostly because the server was friendly enough, mostly talking to my friend since they were classmates. Still, this has got to be one of the worst ramen places in the GTA area."}
{"text":"I was craving for ramen one rainy Sunday afternoon and decided to try a new ramen spot in North York. While searching for one on Yelp, I stumbled on Hakata Shoryuken. 

Upon arriving there, my boyfriend and I were greeted by the waiter and we chose to sit by the windows. We ordered the fried chicken, red hot tonkotsu and hakata tonkotsu (both ramens with an egg) 

The fried chicken arrived first, they were crispy and sizzling hot. Mayo and spicy sauce were provided to give the chicken extra taste! Delicious, but was not a fan of the fried onions in them (I hate onions!). 

Next came our ramens, I got the red hot tonkotsu, and it smelled amazing. However, the egg did not look pleasing. It was sliced in half and while I was hoping for the yolk to come out slowly in liquid form after cutting it mid way through, I was set up for disappointment. The egg was overcooked and looked as if it had been sitting in the fridge overnight. The broth was good, and not too salty and oily. The spicy sauce made the broth taste even better because it added a little kick to it. Although I do wish it was a little bit more spicier. 
The waiter came over to check up on us once and asked if everything was okay. 

Overall, it satisfied my ramen craving, but would not add it to my favourites list."}
{"text":"There are no frills to this restaurant, but the food speaks for itself. The ramen is delicious. If you like spice, I highly recommend ordering the side of ghost peppers. Great ramen for a cold night."}
{"text":"Hakata Ramen Sho Ryu Ken (???) is a cute ramen shop on Yonge, right beside H-Mart. There is free parking just behind the restaurant and also free street parking after 9pm. The wooden interior and exterior of the restaurant gives me a very warm and welcome feeling :) Service is fantastic. You also get 10% off for your bowl of ramen (not your entire bill) when you post a picture on Facebook or Instagram with #hakatashoryuken.

I ordered the Black Tonkatsu (regular broth with black sesame garlic oil) with a creamy soft boiled egg for an additional of $1.50. The broth was very aromatic with the added oil, the noodles were made al dente and the pork belly was flavourful... but dang, only 2 thinnnnnn slices. The extra toppings on the menu were a bit overpriced IMO. The portion was perfect for a light eater like me, but my friend was still hungry afterwards. But the good news is that you can refill your bowl with extra noodles for $2.

The hot sake compliments well with the ramen. The sui gyoza you can skip. Oh mannn, the mochi ice cream was quite the disappointment. $2.50 for a small mochi that clearly came out of a frozen box. I could literally just walk over to H-Mart and buy a box myself. I'm a big dessert person... this actually ruin my experience at the end of my meal.

Overall, ramen was good but definitely skip the mochi. I think Hakata Ramen still has room for improvement. You have a great product here. Really need to stay competitive (with price, portion, unique broth) and shoryuken your competitors on Yonge Street to survive. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First impressions this place was amazing, but the more time I spent in there, I felt it was cheap and service was lacking. 

Staff makes you pay for everything, I had mentioned that I like my ramen with extra soup and the staff told me it would cost me $$.  Asked for tea and staff would say it's extra $$, everything was extra money. I felt they could have answered or catered customers differently or presented info differently.

But overall food was not that great it was okay. Because of the service, I would not come back. Broth was too thick. And salty"}
{"text":"Tender pork, good broth. Wave noodle is not as chewy as I thought, egg is a little salty. Got the spicy pork one. You can read books in the store while eating"}
{"text":"Very nice shop owened my former collegue, a Japanese guy and his wife~ very authetic ramen shop with reasonable price!!  I like it!!!"}
{"text":"Sho Ryu Ken Hakata Ramen might take it's name from a fiery punch technique from the Street Fighter series, but the experience itself is more like a tickle. The food here is bland;  fried chicken, shoryu wings, and their variants of hakata ramen. 

My party ordered the black hakata ramen, the hakata ramen, fried chicken, and the shoryu wings. The fried chicken we ordered came littered with scallions and a small heap of mayo. The fried chicken was burnt, with tinges of black on the batter. The scallions were raw and chopped thin, but they had a tough time staying on the fried chicken. The chefs made no effort to infuse the scallions into the mayo (a.k.a. stir the scallions into the mayo). It lacked flavour and effort. 5 bite sized pieces in total.

The shoryu wings were a little better because they came with hot sauce (the only redeeming thing). They used the exact same spices and batter as the fried chicken. I believe they butchered the wings so that they were split in half...disappointing as it sort of eliminates the purpose of ordering whole wings. In total, one order gives you 2.5 wings (5 halves of a whole wing).

My friend had the black tonkatsu ramen, which was probably one of the better dishes that night. It was heavy on the garlic flavour, but lacked any hints of sesame, salt, or pork. It overwhelmed everything else in the bowl. This was, again, due to the blandness of the food here. The hakata tonkatsu ramen wasn't any better. Yes, the pork broth was creamy - but again it lacked salt. The thin noodles were a nice highlight, but other ramen shops do it better. I was disappointed with the lack of toppings in the ramen as well - no egg, no seaweed, no corn. The pork chashu was a highlight - they blowtorch their pork here like other more popular ramen spots in Toronto.

Overall, the Hakata Ramen experience left us wanting more of everything. We had to go to another restaurant afterwards to satisfy our hunger on a cold fall night and our party had two people who I would consider light eaters. A really bad sign.

Since it's new, I do plan on giving Sho Ryu Ken another shot in a few months time. Maybe they still have some kinks to work out, but I don't plan on returning here in the near future after this first experience."}
{"text":"A cozy little authentic Japanese ramen place that I'll always choose out of the other places nearby. Stuff speaks Japanise. Food is always great and comes in large portions, nice waitresses, good prices and the best atomosphere in my opinion. Overall great experience so I love going here."}
{"text":"Stopped by around 10 for late late dinner.
I ordered the spicy tonkotsu and my cousin ordered the black garlic one.
Definitely lacking in noodle quantity and be careful not to put the entire spoonful of the spicy paste they give you because (I did without thinking because in NYC, it ends up just right) it ended up being a bit too seasoned. The eggs are a bit salty as well though broth was flavorful.

We also had takoyakis which were mostly skin and not enough filling. Still liked it, but could obviously be much better. 

The black garlic ramen was... interesting but I liked my spicy tonkotsu more. 
With a nice flavorful soup base and nice authentic decor, Hakata deserves 4-stars from me."}
{"text":"Ramen- 
Tried the original ramen, pork base soup, thin noodle. Very good! Light tasting, not too heavy but filling! Generous portion of pork, but you can always add extra. I ordered an extra egg on top! (I think it's a must!) but overall pretty good ramen. I would come back. Also ordered chicken karaage. Yummy too! Crunchy! A little chewy on the inside, could use a little bit more cooking time, but still great! Had some left overs. 

Service-
A little on the slow side. Not the best. But is okay!

Parking-
Out front. Paralllel or street parking. Pay machine. Be careful, cops ticket!"}
{"text":"I gave this 5 stars because of all the ramen restaurants in that area (against Kinton/Sansotei/Konjiki/etc...) this is the most balanced one in terms of what you got.

The broth isn't perfect but it's really rich and tastes good.  The noodles are arguably the best one of the bunch.  The value for the sides are amazing, the amount of excellent Karaage for example that you get for just under $5 is pretty insane compared to the competition. The staff are nice as well. 

The only downside is the dining area is pretty small so there will often be wait times depending on when you go.  But it'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment a few times ever since it's opened at yonge/finch. The black tonkatsu ramen was my favorite for the longest time until the chef told me that it's actually burnt garlic... My friends always tried to convince me that the black tonkatsu tasted like burnt... I was like no way, it has to be black sesame. So yea... ever since what the chef told me, I never went back.. not because their ramen doesn't taste good, don't get me wrong, the broth is amazing and it's less MSG-ee than most of the other ramen places in TO... but the burnt stuff was quite a turnoff.

I would recommend this place if you are a huge ramen fan, the broth is not bad and their side dishes are pretty good too. I would give the service 2.5 star, it's always under-staff there."}
{"text":"A small cozy place that is dimly lit with good service. The waitress tells you all the ingredients in the ramen, asking you if you're okay with them and she did check up on me once during my meal. The broth was tasty but I wasn't a big fan of the thin noodles. I find the portions to be a bit small as well compared to other ramen places."}
{"text":"Black Tonkatsu Ramen ($10.80, +$1.50 for the egg) and karaage on the side ($6.95). Don't mind the missing pieces, I ate a few before taking the pic...
The soup base was really flavorful, liked it! The ramen was super thin, nice and chewy. There were a lot of noodles, I couldn't finish it all. The ramen comes with only 2 thin slices of Cha shu and I couldn't believe it didn't come with the egg! There were actually decent amount of chicken karaage, lightly breaded and didn't taste heavy at all. It did however lack a bit of flavour. Was good but I felt like something was missing."}
{"text":"This is actually one of my favourite ramen to go place. The salty level is just right for me. Some are super salty and/or oily, but Shoryuken is just perfect in my opinion. I just love this place :D I will come back again and again~!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and good ramen! Kinton is down the street but although they focus on tonkotsu broth, I find the ramen chewy, and tasty.. Cooks are directly from Hokkaido as this ramen is quite tasty... Very authentic ramen..


They have a new ramen (on special) with ground pork instead of bbq pork and still this was delicious.... The hit tonkotsu base is spicy but very flavorful"}
{"text":"Best ramen I've had in Toronto for sure. Broth is thick and rich. Noodles are the right texture. Love it. Come here all the time."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last week with my wife and a friend. We had ramen and some wings. The same night at 4:00 am, I woke up and throw up with all the food I had, and became very sick for the next two days. I had no clean or not fresh food. Caution is advised.

Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Both visits to this ramen shop with my girlfriend it was curiously empty for a weekday dinner timeframe. I had the chashu lover with the smoked chashu substitution and extra marinated egg, with kaedama (I had anticipated I would need more, based on the smaller portions I had experienced from my very first visit). Broth here is flavourful, noodles with a great chew and bounce, and portions overall more generous than the first time (slight regret ordering the kaedama)! The chicken nanban was excellent, with perfectly executed crispy exterior (potato starch type crust) and succulent and flavourful interior, with a perfect egg-salad-like mayo based sauce. Perfect with a pint of Sapporo. If they made this into a don, I could eat it everyday. I'll have to come back more often."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, quick/attentive service, and absolutely love the name of this place. The food however, was fairly mediocre. 

The \"Red hot\" tonkotsu wasn't that hot at all. It was nice that the place served us a spoon filled with the chili-paste, so that we could adjust the spiciness level. However, after using the entire spoonful, the ramen was still pretty mild. The pork was quite tender and tasty, and definitely the best part of the meal. 

Like the ramen, the shoryu chicken wings were also much smaller than expected, though I suppose fair given the price. Every two wings (of the 6) were pretty much just one wing separated into two. That being said, the wings were well-spiced and tender.

I left this place still hungry, which is rare for me after having ramen - they can definitely increase their serving sizes to match some of their competitors.  As mentioned though, the service was quite good, and the Street Fighter theme was enjoyable."}
{"text":"Was back here again this winter and the broth was not as great as I remembered. Last time I had the black garlic version and this time i had the regular tonkotsu version with the he Karage donburi. It was good, but not amazing. 

My friend says this place is vouched for by all his japanese coworkers (he has a lot of them), but maybe my taste-buds are too westernized. 

Still great Japanese service though."}
{"text":"Returning customer... I enjoy their thick wavy noodles more than the thing. I get the chashu noodle as I enjoy more meat than the regular portions. I do find their black garlic noodle very flavourful and tasty. 

Try to get seated before 7pm, otherwise you're in for a pretty long wait. Place is usually pretty packed.

Don't order their wings.. it's just average. Get the kaarage instead."}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm a huge fan of Kinton Ramen, but Hakata Shoryuken offers its own unique ramen styles which left me quite happy. Definitely will be back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I am back AGAIN! Finally got a chance to try their lunch menu!! 

We had the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen with wavy noodles and Combo A which was the Karage Don. And let me tell you... O.M.G, the chicken was out of this world!!! One bite into this thing and a burst of wine flavour is released onto your tastebuds. This chicken was absolutely amazing. Sounds like an exaggeration but trust me, it's THAT damn good. The rice and its condiments was a perfect combo! Mayo, teriyaki sauce (I believe) green onions and seseme seed... you can taste each of these ingredient's aroma unravel the more you eat it. Best Don I've had yet, I must say.

The lunch combo is $13.99 and it is only offered on Tuesday-Friday from 12pm-3pm. It comes with a Hakata Tonkutsu Ramen with 3 Combo options: A)Karage Don, B) ChaShu Don and C) Rice with Gyoza. Great lunch deal between a friend or S/O or just yourself if you're a big eater... and there's nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Nice decor & good service.  A good neighbourhood ramen place.  Obviously this is not comparable to Sansotei or santouka.  But i think it is way better than Kinton down the block.  The broth is good and the ramen is nice.  My preference is thick noodle but they only offer thin ones.  Also the noodle doesn't come with egg and you can add it on for additional cost.  We've tried a few of their appetizer item like beef tartar, it is quite tasty.  Overall, this is a good place to go
to ease my ramen craving if I am not in downtown."}
{"text":"3.5/5
Good as usual, but a few improvements can definitely be made.

-For additional toppings, I wish they had raw grated garlic
-There was not enough soup for extra noodles
-The egg I got in my ramen was very cold egg and over marinated. It also brought down the overall temperature of the ramen
-The holes in the red pepper bottle is way too small for the peppers to come out
-I really hope they serve shichimi (seven spice) instead of the red pepper."}
{"text":"Hakata Tonkotsu ($9.80) + Soft Boiled Egg ($1.50) was good if one enjoys the rich and aromatic pork broth. 

The noodle is one of the thinnest I had but still well cooked with a nice chewiness. 

Service was painfully slow from taking my order to being served! I thought Ramen suppose to be \"fast\" food. So make sure you give yourself a lot of time even when the restaurant is not busy.

If you do have a bigger appetite, I strongly recommend the Chashu Lover ($13) and add $2 for extra noodle.

A little pricey for the portion but good for an occasional snack!"}
{"text":"The Tanten ramen's soup is too salty, and Chasu ramen was so bland. The pork was overly fat and the portions were tiny. Such low quality of flavour, authenticity and taste. I do not recommend coming here ever."}
{"text":"I loved this place. I had the black tonkotsu ramen - which had black sesame garlic oil in the regular broth. It gave it such flavour, and the broth was good and rich. I paid $9.80 for the ramen + $1.50 for the egg, which made it totally worth it. You can add other toppings as well for a cost. 

The service was great, they did check up on me a couple of times after I got my meal. And it's got a cool atmosphere, even has some eating space along counters which reminded me of Japan. 

I'll probably comeback and get in on their Tuesday - Thursday appetizer + pint deal ($3. 50 Sapporo pint with purchase of an appetizer). 

If you're in the area, so check this place out. I'll be returning soon."}

A few days ago, I came here to have a quick lunch before heading out. I was really craving ramen. 

The restaurant was fairly busy at lunchtime. Had to wait a couple of minutes before sitting, but the waitress handed a menu to look at while waiting. 
The restaurant is fairly small, however well decorated with paintings of 3 characters from Street Fighter. 

I ordered the hakata tonkotsu with less oil and less salt -- I'm not a fan for salty and oily soups. 

Shoryuken's menu is very limited; much smaller selection as compared to Sansotei or Santouka. The price on each bowl is also higher than other ramen shops, about $10 per bowl (excludes egg, bean sprouts, etc.); the ramen comes with only seaweed and chashu. Ramen at other places are about $8-$9. Also, the size of the bowls are small. I was about 70% full after sharing an appetizer with my hubby and having a bowl of ramen for myself. I wish they could up the portions. 

However, the taste of the soup and chashu is to die for. The broth tasted so rich, with the aroma of chashu, a hint of salt and just the right amount of oil. The chashu wasn't too fatty and was made delicious with the right amount of oil. At other ramen shops, I can barely finish 2 slices of the chashu and rarely ever finish the broth because it is so oily.

A downside to this restaurant is that the kitchen can be slow. My hubby and I waited for about 35 mins to get our food (lunchtime at 1pm). 

Conclusion:
Hands down, the best broth and chashu I have had so far at any ramen shop. Worth paying a little more for the quality. :)
Would recommend (but make sure you have time to spare)."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this place.

The last time I went here was for lunch on a Wednesday and I'd definitely recommend going to this place for their lunch special during the week which I believe runs to about 3 pm from Mon-Thursday. What you get with the special is your choice of a bowl of Ramen, and either the Karage don or the Cha shiu don. I usually go for the Karage as the Ramen I usually choose already has Cha Siu on it -- it runs for under $15 bucks before tax and definitely fills you up!

Have a look at the photos and you'll see what I mean!"}

{"text":"Right off the bat what you will notice as soon as you walk in is the amount of peace compared to other places. I could actually have a conversation without any noise . Small, cozy spot with a great hearty broth full of flavor without the saltiness and bloat. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The apps were nothing to rave about the dumplings were cold. Service was friendly. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"this place is great .. beats Kinton & Ajisen that are also in the hood.  Broth may be too salty to some but I think it's delicious."}
{"text":"service 5/5 always polite & very friendly

{"text":"Damn, right as I sat down inside the restaurant and saw the Street Fighter art on the wall, it took me back to my childhood playing street fighter on my cousin's Sega Dreamcast. Lots of nostalgia was brought back to my friends and I while eating here.

We had a party of 9 and had called earlier in the day trying to make reservations and was told they couldn't do that - no wonder, this place is quite small! There's about 6 small tables and seating along the front store window. I wouldn't recommend coming here with more than a group of 4! (We were lucky to get a table for 9 though, we showed up at 7pm on a Friday night and managed to grab a bunch of tables and put them together which took up half the restaurant already).

Enough about the space inside this place, on to the ramen. Most of us got their regular tonkotsu ramen with wavy noodles (which are thicker and chewier). I love that they give a good variety of add-ons, I added sweet corn to mine! Broth was flavourful and portions were decent. The price I paid was definitely justified. 

Come when you're not in a rush and sit down and grab one of their mangas to read too! They have a a bunch of books lying around for your perusal."}
{"text":"Cozy spot along Yonge. The Red Hot Tonkatsu was a good size, noodles were cooked to perfection however the broth was very salty. Overall was a good experience, but I prefer Sansotei just up the street."}
{"text":"Went here two days in a row. Service is consistent. Their cha shew pork was awesome it looks very fatty and likely going to reduce your life expectancy but they made it in such a way that it does not taste like you're eating a glob of fat.

The ambiance is sort of traditional with low key Street Fighter themes especiallty on the board probably because of the Sho Ryu Ken name.  There's also some comics on the side for you to peruse if you actually have time in your limited lunch hours.

There is less people here than the other, other ramen shop just south of my office and Ajisen which looked pricey.  Probably because it is further from the subway stop, but bonus for me since I don't have to deal with the lunch crowds.

Their noodles are known as \"Hakata\" style as per the name of the restaurant.  So it's not your typical curly ramen.  I would describe the noodles as akin to straight angel hair pasta that is a bit al dente.  The second time I was there the noodles seem a bit better.  One of the cashiers told me that they will eventually bring the more normal curly noodles that I am used to in Niwatei.  Also even though it seems like angel hair pasta, it is still a long ways over than Ajisen's spaghetti noodles.

The broth is a bit thicker than what I am used to.  However, I can still drink it down to the bottom of the bowl.  So it feels a bit heavier in the end.

The price is just right for the area at about $13 a bowl for the cha shew lover, but their combos are very weird in that you get ramen with a (not quite small) rice bowl.  It's like their trying to carbo load the customers.  The first time I went there I just split the karage don/ramen combo with a coworker who does not eat pork related food.

The one star drop was primarily because of their lack of a proper combo.  I think if they had a $13 chashew lover ramen with egg then it would make a proper deal and a more fulfilling ramen, but adding an extra $$ for the egg was just way overboard.

This place would likely be my regular ramen place during my contract primarily because of the location and cost, plus on on my way back south to the office/subway, I can always stop by L'Opera for some light dessert aka Guava Berry."}
{"text":"What I really admired about Hakata's Tonkotsu ramen was the light broth, which was \"just right\" in saltiness. Moreover, their pork chasu was quite delicate but very savory. Meanwhile, their karaage is one of the best I've had so far (a MUST have). Whether you're eating for one or a small group, Hakata Ramen gives you a cozy, authentic ambience with a unique street fighter (yes the videogame) theme. Another great way to warm up during the cold weather."}
{"text":"The milk based pork bone broth is the best. Not too spicy, hearty serving of noodles and meat along with vegetable seasonings.

Came to dine at 630 pm on a Monday, definitely a good time to go because there is no line up! 

They don't have too many different ramen styles but the choices are spot on and tasty. 

Reasonably priced as well. My rating is 4/5!"}
{"text":"Located on Yonge near Church Ave in North York, this place serves up delicious bowls of ramen. I've gone numerous times and the ramen is definitely satisfying on a cold winter's day. They also have a lunch special which is of good value as you get to choose a small rice bowl (with either pork or kaarage) and a bowl of ramen. My go to order here is the black tonkotsu ramen - delicious and satisfying!

Service is friendly and attentive, the space is warm and inviting, and the hot bowls of ramen keep you warm on cold days."}
{"text":"Named after a famous uppercut move from one of my favourite games growing up. Newly opened Sho Ryu Ken Hakata Ramen is a step up from your usual franchised Japanese Ramen. 

Warm wooden interior, great hospitable service, and extremely savoury Ramen. Until I had this Ramen, I dreamed only of the days where I had similar quality ramen in LA. 

This Ramen will surprise you. There are only main bowls to choose from. Each come with seriously the most incredibly soft melt in your mouth sliced pork. The broth is rich and flavourful. 

I also ordered the fried chicken which was amazing in its own right. 

My only issue which really isn't one is the large amount of oil in the broth. But that I'm sure can be reduce by just asking. 

I recommend this to anyone who loves Authentic Japanese ramen.
