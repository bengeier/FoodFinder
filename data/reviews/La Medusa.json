{"text":"It is terrible management/customer service when a restuarant allows customers to book reservations for New Years Eve dinner, then decides to be closed for New Years Eve but doesn't have the decency to call/email the customer and let them know. We had our day planned around our dinner plans, which we had made almost a month in advance. We had gotten all ready and arrived at the restuarant to find it dark with locked doors at 830 pm. What a terrible thing to do, especially on New Years Eve...but a great way to lose customers."}
{"text":"Meatball is exceptional, and I would argue that it and the pizza are best in class. Great ambiance and exceptional service. I'll be back every time I find myself in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Yes. Only because we never got a chance to eat here. Seems we showed up at 5:00pm (opening time) and was turned away because even though the restaurant was empty, it was Hockey night and unless we had reservations for dinner they didn't have room for us. Seems it is a big deal with this place. We left and had an over the top amazing dinner at \"BIS\" on the next street. So glad \"there was no room at the Inn.\""}
{"text":"Great food but feel owner is a crook and charged too much money, He had decided to make his own menu for my two friends and I and stuck us with a 400 hundred dollar tab."}
{"text":"A great Italian gem in Montreal! I had the gnocchi and a salad and loved every bite! The service was amazing and we never had to wait for the waiters, someone was already there to help. They surprised us with some delicious gelato in the end. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very  small Italian restaurant.Traditional Northern Italian cooking - excellent veal. Good wine list. 

 Friendly staff. Close to Bell Centre and Sheraton Hotel on René-Lévesque."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had in my life. We were ignored while the owner was entertaining friends of his that were drunk and obnoxious."}
{"text":"This is a very solid Italian place within walking distance of hotel row on Sherbrooke.  It was quiet on the Wednesday night that I went, so the only noise to be heard was the baffling musical selection - American 80s pop.  Bobby Brown's My Prerogative and She Blinded Me With Science kept me company through my salad course.

Despite this, I had a nice time from top to bottom.  The service was prompt and friendly, the portions were small but flavorful (hats off for excellent and tender veal), and the top floor allowed for people watching.  My one complaint is that if you ask for water, you're getting bottled flat water, so make sure to go hydrated.

You don't need to dress to the nines, but I'd recommend jeans, a polo and nice shoes at the minimum.  It's worth a trip if you're staying nearby."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had to carb load on our pre race night and the other Italian place I'd read about was booked so I made a reservation here.  Turns out I didn't really need one for 8:30 pm on a Saturday night.  The place wasn't that busy.  

The atmosphere was very comfortable and intimate.  We were seated downstairs at a corner table.  I liked that the Medusa logo was casually placed through out(including on the glasses) the restaurant.  It had a European decor to it with a modern twist.  80s music played in the background all night and I loved it!  Michael Jackson's Billy Jean and She Bop by Cindi Lauper totally made my night!  There was also some Richard Marx in there.  Ok.  

Our wait staff was very attentive.  No water glass went empty.  Orders were taken promptly.  We got bread and the little pizza appetizer quickly.  Our salads were a good size.  I found mine quite filling.  I had the cucumber & tomato salad and my daughter had the caesar salad.  For my meal I had the Cannelloni alla Romana, which was typical cannelloni.  I found it to be delicious and filling as well.  My daughter got Spaghetti à la Gorgy, which is spaghetti, prosciutto and peas with a creamy white sauce.  Not what she expected, but she did really enjoy it.  It was a huge serving and far too much for her to eat.  Thank goodness for take out containers!  

My only issue was after a nice meal I love a little something sweet.  We wanted to split something, but they only offered gelato from next door.  I had drank a lot of water and the temps were a little cool in the restaurant so gelato was the last thing I wanted.  They did give my daughter a scoop for free and I tried a small bite.  It was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I ordered the eggplant parmigiana as an app - the sauce was incredible, and the dish would have been exceptional, but it was cold! (The sauce was hot). I also ordered the salad with radicchio and other greens, two large grilled shrimp, avocado, and grilled asparagus. It was large and delicious. My husband had pasta bolognese, which was good. Pasta was cooked just right.

The service was a bit odd. The first server, possibly an owner?, seemed put out by my selections (app + salad, which turned out to be huge) and request for lemon, which I always request. He insisted the salad had a dressing, it did and was nice, made even tastier by the addition of the lemon, lol. He asked where were from when I asked for the lemon. Just an odd dude. Other servers were nice enough."}
{"text":"Been going here for the pst 5 years.  Familly run business (two brothers) do a great job making their guests feel welcomed.  Love the new renovations - super comfortable chairs wide tables - great for a business lunch or support with the family.   I always start with an off menu item - a sort of lasagna in chicken broth omg delicious!  Then anything else in the menu is always done to perfection - on this visit I had the veal saltimboca and was not disappointed.   The mixed plate (half bottle) of gelato - I couldn't decide which one i liked better."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and amazing service. Highly recommended. We had Capri Pizza, Caesar salad, spaghetti bolognese and the seafood pasta and everything was top notch. So glad we found it.

And the gelato for dessert was to die for."}
{"text":"I asked the hotel concierge for a place  nearby for wood fired pizza

\"Sir right next door\"

As soon as I sat down I could smell the truffle oil . A good sign

Well executed and perfect pizza was delivered to me within a few minutes and was cut into four ready for knife and fork eating

Knock back a mango Gelato and life is good on the patio

{"text":"Hmm, so many pros and cons, I'm conflicted.

First off, this place was DEAD on a Wednesday night. At the end of our meal I went downstairs to the ladies' room and saw they had many more tables down in a grotto-like area but still, only a few tables were full. We sat on the upper floor, overlooking the street. It was nice but they had talk radio blaring a depressing story about some kidnapped child. It really bothered me. I was just about to say something when our server brought us a complimentary pizza appetizer. Ok, a little better. shortly after the radio was changed to dated pop music. Random.

The server was a nice, quiet man. It must be a cultural thing but there are LONG PAUSES between courses with no checking in with us, which annoyed me. Anyway, he was very nice and friendly but still, there was no one there, I felt like he should have doted more? 

The food itself was delicious, though portions were very small. I left still feeling hungry. I had the chicken al limone which was rich and flavorful but tiny. Also pricey, I'm still unsure if there was any value to be had paying as much as we did.

I had a nice time here but maybe the experience would have been different on a different night/time. Ah well."}
{"text":"I have to say that my boyfriend and I were treated like monarchs when we visited Medusa. You would think this would actually incline one to repeat such a  flattering experience; but the in-authenticity of it all made me realize my experience would have been different if my boyfriend and I had been dressed differently. 

Dressed in business attire having come from the office, my boyfriend and I were welcomed by the owner of the establishment. True story: we were given complimentary appetizers for no apparent reason (not that I'm complaining about that part), and while we waited for our plates to arrive, the owner proceeded to give us a tour of the restaurant, and his other restaurant upstairs (Arlequino Pizzeria). He then proceeded to show us a private banquet room, where he explained that such a hall would be perfect for an engagement party (wink wink towards me) or even a business conference (nudge nudge towards the bf). He capped it off with some information on the priciest wines from his wine collection . He then accompanied us back to our seats as our meals were being placed on the table, and gave us complimentary promo bags. 

I wonder if we would have been doted on as much if we didn't appear to be wealthy young professionals."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian cuisine. Brought my wife and two girls for their first time, certainly not mine. They truly enjoyed the snails with tomato sauce, the beef carpaccio, lamp chop, seafood risotto and lasagna. Top it off with gelato, tiramisu and espresso and grappa. 

Salute."}
{"text":"When you look at this restaurant from the outside it looks like a small quant little place but when you go down its more like an endless maze.
But its wines make up for the charm this place has.
We were going to the Muse concert and time was limited. I rarely eat pasta  but being in an italian rest I had to try the lasagna. he told me its his moms secret recipe and we ordered the eggplant as a starter.
Since we were pressed or time everything came together. Eggplant was great and so was my lasagna which cam in a white wine sauce. never seen that before and I just loved it. I will go back just for that dish.
They got 5 stars as my wifes pasta was a little hard maybe under cook as we pressed them for time. But we still enjoyed it."}
