{"text":"I went to the Embassy Suites for a business workshop. I am not sure how the hotel rooms were, but I do know that the service at the American Bar and Grill located on the 5th floor was terrible. We received an hour for lunch, and it took them that long just to get us our food. When we did receive it, half the orders were wrong and only part of our group received their meal at the same time. It was the first time in my life that I sent the meal back and refused to pay. 

As for the hotel itself, it wasn't much better. The meeting room was sweltering even though the facilitator requested for the air conditioning to be turned up. Almost every stall in the bathrooms lacked toilet paper."}
{"text":"My brother and I road-tripped from Pittsburgh up to Cleveland to see \"Spinal Tap:  Unplugged & Unwigged\".  We booked a two bedroom, two bathroom suite at the Embassy Suites.  American Bar & Grill is actually the hotel's restaurant.  We didn't have time to go searching for a restaurant before the show, so we ate here.

It's pretty much your typical hotel eatery.  Not great, but not bad.  It's not really worth going out of your way to eat here.  Food here ranges from $8.00 to $9.00 for sandwiches and $15.00  to $20.00 for entrees.  I had a cajun chicken sandwich that was pretty good, but about the same I'd get anywhere.  In short, it fills the bill if you don't have time to look for another place."}
{"text":"Stayed at the embassy suites while in Cleveland and ate here for dinner.  It was surprisingly very good!  I had the tomato soup which was one of the best tomato soup I've ever had.  It had a hint of spiciness without being overwhelming, and it wasn't too heavy.  I also had the almond chicken salad and the ingredients were all fresh!  Five stars!"}
