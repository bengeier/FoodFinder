{"text":"Not sure, how this place received any good reviews. The service was bad, as well as, the food. It took a while to be seated, even though there were plenty of empty tables.  I ordered the BBQ pork and Duck, the meat smelled really rancid. I was so disgusted. I informed the waiter that the food was bad, he didn't offer a refund, just the bill to pay. Beware of this place."}
{"text":"Nice food (noodle soup and mongolian beef) for reasonable price. Service ia good, but limited English. Oh well, you go here for the good food at cheap prices!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this diner.  Perhaps a little hard to find.  Well worth the search.  Dumplings are delicious with both a sweet soy and pepper sauce.  Clams w/black bean sauce, not too salty.  Rice a simple item, cooked perfectly to accompany the Mongolian beef.  Baby bok choy (greens) also nice and crunchy.    The service was excellent, friendly and includes WiFi.    They may not be busy but I believe they are very new (2 months).  I do hope they are still here when I return next year.  I know they weren't here last year."}
{"text":"Noodles are overdone.  Soup base and sauce has no flavor.  Not worth the money. Extremely overpriced for less than mediocre dish."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because at least one of our dishes turned out to be OK. I ordered Pad Thai and my wife got the noodle soup. The noodle soup was fine, but Pad Thai was just bland. I got a Boba tea, which cost about $5 or so, but we ended up with a $38 bill with only 2 dishes that cost only $12 each at most, so I guess they actually charged for the water that we asked when we were waiting for our orders. This is the fun part: when we were ready to pay and leave, the owner actually demanded that we pay by cash. I know some small places can decline credit card or charge a small fee if a purchase is under $10, but common guys, it was almost $40. I would not come back to this place."}
{"text":"Decent place, decent food friendly service. Like it, will be back when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Sorry to say this place was pretty bad...the noddles are like the ramen noodles but I think the ones in a cup would taste better! I ordered the wonton noodle soup and was surprised they had shrimp in them. Maybe they were shrimp dumplings tossed in soup. The soup itself had no flavor..my mom got duck and wonton soup mixed. The duck was full of fat and bones. I would not come back."}
{"text":"This place is no bueno.  There was only two other people eating. We ordered the spring rolls appetizer and that came in AFTER our main dishes.  The fried rice was so bland and NO flavor.  The chow mein seemed so cheap and had too much oil and not enough flavor.  The customer service was not the best either.  I asked for spoons and forks and just gave me forks, they dont really listen.  Overall, I will not come back here again, ill just try china max right around the corner."}
{"text":"Authentic chinese food. Good price too. We will be back. ?????????the lady was friendly. Wish we found this place sooner."}
{"text":"The GPS location is a bit off. This place is not on the side of Harley Davidson . It's in the market square that the China Max and Chilles are located. The main entries are $10 to $12 range, which is very reasonable for the strip location. The food is custom cooked (vs. Panda Express) and is quite good for the price."}
{"text":"Mike is by far the funniest server here. Gteat experience and fun time. Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was really delicious. Was hesitant at first because of all the previous reviews, but I'm glad we came in today. It was practically empty except for some dudes that were in there giving the workers a hard time (they left shortly after my group walked in).   First off their menu choices are small but you can always have them make your soup or noodles how you want.   I had the tofu and mixed veggies (very delicious). The chicken soup with mixed veggies (perfect when you don't want to feel bloated). The general Tao chicken was by far what had us amazed (it was the first dish out). We had the fried dumplings (simple but a lot of flavor). My cousins got the chicken lo lein and the yang chow fried rice.    Most importantly the staff was very attentive to us. It's like any other restaurant. If you're nice to the employees they're nice to you. Don't hesitate to ask them to make a dish in a different way than they have it on the menu.   Price was cheap for being on the strip. Most definitely coming back when I visit Las Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambience. The sesame ball as a starter was great to have. The service is quick as well."}
{"text":"Should have checked the reviews first. This is a bad restaurant. First, they are inside Paris yet don't recognize status. But after sitting at table and ordering food I can't recommend at all. We asked for an extra plate since we were sharing rice- we never got it. The food is not good. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"It is late at night, i ordered small hot pot soup which cost $14.95 for two people. The server brought out a small pot with seafood n napa cabbage. The soup wasnt hot enough and fishy. The bill come out $21.80 which included $5.60 service charged. So ridiculous . we own 6 restaurants and event 18% gratuity still wont be that much. Consider last time n never come back. Thanks"}
{"text":"Only came in here because my mom wanted some hot soup. They questioned when we came in 3 ppl but ordered only 2 dishes and they tried to ask me to order more. When i tip based on the bill, they said usually 3 ppl tip more but that's ok!?! Food was ok. Will nevet come back"}
{"text":"Don't bother!  I can't even began to describe how poor the service was. Food was no better. Staff was all very young and they clearly had never been trained."}
{"text":"Just happened to pass by and thought we'd try it out, and glad we did. Dumplings taste great if you're will to spend a little more for quality food. Waiters are happy to explain dishes and what pairs well with each other. Would happily come back any time, it's definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"(This was originally posted under Ru Yi Noodle House, which I believe is the same cuz that's translated from its Chinese name) WARNING! DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE! DISHONEST AND BAD SERVICE! ??????????? I usually do not rant on Yelp. But people should be alert of this kind of shitty service and not give your money away.   We visited on Dec 20th evening, I wasn't even planning to eat here, just walking pass-by and saw the board outside says milk bubble tea in Chinese. It was late in the evening, and a bit chilly so I decided to get a cup of warm bubble tea.   5 minutes after I ordered a hot milk tea with bubble, I couldn't believe I was still engaged in conversation with the owner. It goes like this:  Me: I want a hot milk tea. Owner: Do you want bubbles? Me: Yes. Owner: Do you want it hot or cold? Me: Hot, do you serve hot? Owner: Well, you know most people usually prefer cold milk tea, since it's better experience.. Me: (interrupts) so do you make it hot? Owner: If you insist, I can make it hot..but most people want it cold you know. Do you want bubbles? Me: Yes. How much is it?(taking my money out) Owner: it's 75cents extra with bubbles, so 5.75 without bubble, and 6.5 with bubbles. Me: (not happy with this overpriced tea, but it's tourism area, so i put my money on the table), ok, i want a hot milk tea with bubbles. Owner: so you still want it hot?  Back to where we began!! And while conversing, some customers entered, so this owner just left in the middle of our conversation and turned to attend those new customers who apparently wanted to dine(so potentially worth more money than me), i've never experienced server this rude. Btw, the restaurant was pretty much empty. They had at least 3 servers out including the owner, so he didn't have to attend to those customers.  Meanwhile, another server who was pouring tea (yes they do have a hot teapot I saw that) behind the counter, asked the owner what I wanted in Chinese. I can understand them the whole time, it basically went \"ok, what does she want? she wants milk tea, hot\"(very impatiently). I asked my last question: \"so will you serve hot milk tea or not??\", owner again murmured: \"Well, you know most people usually prefer cold milk tea, since it's better experience..but if you insist i can make hot\". OMFGGGG, it's a matter of 6 dollars, if you can not offer what you say you can, just DON'T SAY YOU OFFER IT!   So 15 minutes of unpleasant conversations and wait later, I stormed out without milk tea.  And did I mention that on their milk tea menu on the wall, there was no price at all?? Obviously they like to charge whatever price they have for ya. It's a shame that they try to fool tourists especially Chinese tourists. I didn't pay anything in the end, but I believe other reviewers were right about them adding extra for tip. Of course they will.  ?????????????????????????strip?????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I walked into this place because I wanted some dumplings! When you say that you're a dumpling house, I just kinda assumed that there would be a bit more dim sum.   That was not a correct assumption. While I ended up getting some pork dumplings (pot stickers) my friends were hungry and got eggrolls and soups. They said their soups were just whatever, but my dumplings were good. Just wish I had more verity to choose from.   The boba however was quite unfortunate as it had more ice than anything else. Also our service was a little weird with dishes coming out very quickly and extremely late. We were asked for orders before we even got menus, and it took a while to get our missing silverware sets.   With so many other options close by I dont anticipate stopping in here again."}
{"text":"Great appetizers, sake is very strong which is good lol and service was fast and friendly. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"authentic chinese without having to go to chinatown. staff speaks little english but very nice and trys very hard to be helpful. had the wonton noodle soup, mapo tofu and kung pao chicken. all very good. mapo tofu has that tingling Scechwan style spice. interior is nothing special, just think chinatown. restaurant is only few months new so they're still getting the hang of it. they must of read the review of really salty food because ours were slightly on the bland side."}
{"text":"The food and service was great! I found this place when I was checking in to the hotel. The decorations of this place looked so cool. I wanted to try what type of food they had. Luckily my parents and I enjoyed this place to eat. I got dim sum, dumplings, noodle soup, Shanghai noodles, and tea. It was all good ! Towards the end,  they kept on walking around and checking if we finished or paid yet. The place was half empty so it just made us feel uncomfortable at the end of our meal. Then they circled the suggested tip, it felt a little forceful to give a tip."}
{"text":"Stay away.   Terrible service. Maybe ten people in the restaurant. And they couldn't get the orders out in a timely manner. One lady waited an hour for soup. Our group of seven got orders one at a time in a span of forty minutes and they forgot part of our order. Another couple just wanted to leave.   This was Murphys Law at its worst."}
{"text":"Very generic and overpriced food and service was bad...I asked for a cup of white rice and the dimsum lady kept pointing at different other food and then finally decided that I was asking for some sauce so I gave up. How do you serve at an Asian restaurant without at least knowing what rice is!? So I asked the waiter and waited 15 min and twice he said it was coming. White rice in an Asian restaurant should be like water...readily available. Finally, I asked another waitress and she gave it to me right away but my food was cold already."}
{"text":"This place was very average. I went here with my family as I was getting sick of the constant burger, pizza and hotdog, I wish I hadn't it was a massive waste. The food was very average and tasted quite bland, the soup dumplings dos not have that pork flavour you look for and the Cha Sui noodle soup tastes like water. On top of that they put on a service tax of 15% when they gave us no service at all and when we questioned it they laughed at us.  Very disappointed I don't know how this can last on the strip.  The place is wheelchair accessible but I wouldn't suggest going here."}
{"text":"This place spoiled our dinning experience in Vegas. It was so hot in Vegas and happened to stop by here and it should be a warning sign when all the staff including the cook from the restaurant coming out to talk us in. We ordered a scallion pancake, stir fried noodle, mix mushroom with seafood and a soup cook vegetable. The seafood pancake is ok but only a little of scallion. The noodle and vegetables were so salty that were unbearable to eat!! We actually used water to wash it down!!!!! The sauce is so thick that is look like jello. I wish yelp could allow me to give a zero star to this place. This place also charge us $2.95 for water. I had never write so badly about a restaurant. I wish I had gone to panda express instead of this junk."}
{"text":"Restaurant was deserted. Almost didn't go in but did after 10mins of peeping in bc didn't want to spend too much money. Had to keep calling waitress for napkins, to order, for drinks. Came here with 6ppl total. Ordered 5 dishes to share. All we tasted was salt. A bit too oily, too. Seemed like a family business that is too comfortable like at home and not like a restaurant environment. Better off going to Panda Express bc it's good and you don't have to pay tips for bad service."}
{"text":"The vibe of the restaurant was a very fast paced setting. We ordered our entrees and 5 minutes later we were approached by a cart filled with dumplings, small plates and exotic foods. We picked what we wanted and boom... our appetizers were there. My party enjoyed their food to the fullest, not leaving much waste behind. One of the better Asian cuisines I've been too! Must check them out, especially if you're staying at Paris."}
{"text":"This place is not bad.. Rather its a little hole in the wall spot to visit when in the Vegas Strip. I'm not too fond of fast-food, and Vegas seems to be cluttered with those sort of options. I enjoy piping hot Asian food, and that is what I found in this little Chinese restaurant. It seems a bit lonely and run down. But once you enter, you're greeted warmly by the servers. Their werent that many people inside, but it didnt really matter to me. I went ahead and ordered the crispy scallion pancakes, hot milk tea, and pad thai with tofu.  The best item from my order was the scallion pancakes. They were crisp, hot and fresh. It's more of an appetizer item, but scallion pancakes have always been a favorite of mine so I was pleased by their appeal and flavor. I already knew that ordering pad thai at a Chinese restaurant was not the best idea, but luckily it wasnt too bad. The flavor was not authentic, but it still tasted fresh. The tofu was soft and crisp, and the noodles were tender. I would give it 3 stars. The Chinese style hot milk tea did not taste good at all! I would give that beverage a 1 star. I am a big fan of milk tea, but this drink did not deliver the taste that i was craving. They also have tapioca here, but im glad I did not order that. I'm not too sure if it would have been any good.   Anyway, the menu is quite large. I was hoping their would be a vegetarian option for dumplings, but their wasnt. This place doesnt have the best food on the strip, but its not awful either. I would maybe try other items off the menu if I were to visit again. Nothing to write home about. Just hot food without all the junk."}
{"text":"It's actually pretty good for how inexpensive the prices were. Although they do not have a large menu, they had a good range of selections. Walking along the strip or even driving by it, you could easily miss it. It's in a marketplace of restaurants and vendors close to Polo Towers and the Travelodge.  After eating finely the two days prior on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided as a group to stroll the marketplace (which was steps away from our hotel --the Polo Towers) and see what we wanted to eat that wouldn't cost a lot, and couldn't drive anyway because none of us could legally do that at the time, if you catch my drift.  There weren't too many patrons inside so service wasn't slow for us. There's a good number of tables and seats here as well as a wall mural of photos depicting food around the world. The 6 of us sat down, ordered food, and received food in a timely fashion. We were out of there in 15mins and didn't feel rushed...except that it was almost time for the Walking Dead episode to come on..  I ordered the miso ramen. I've had better noodles in San Diego but the broth was nice. No MSG present (I'm sensitive to MSG so I'll know), and really satisfies me. Others in my group got a roasted duck and BBQ pork bowl (roasted duck has bones so beware), roasted duck and wontons soup,  as well as shrimp fried rice which had full shrimps tossed in.  Not bad compared to other eateries on the strip and doesn't hurt my wallet."}
{"text":"I'm a noodle and dumpling lover! Awesome dumplings and beef  hand pulled fresh noodles, is a must in vegas!!!!   Bad location though"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a quick and tasty meal, especially when dining alone or on a business trip. The dim sum is for sure the best way to go at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service! Ordered noodles and Hainan chicken over rice. Good place to visit in the hotel for lunch. Overall, nice experience!"}
{"text":"Not too bad for a joint in the corner. We came in near closing time and each got a dish. BBQ Pork and Duck w/rice, BBQ Pork and Wonton Noodle, Beef Noodle Soup, and Pan fried dumplings.  The price was decent for being on the strip. In houston beef noodle is around $5-6 over here its doubled. Same goes for the 6 dumplings that cost around $7.  However the food was good, nothing was left except on my plate they did give me a ton of rice. The duck was well seasoned as was the bbq pork. The dumplings skin was nicely fried and thick enough to provide a chew. Also the sauce was tasty!"}
{"text":"Csme for some rice and chicken with ginger sauce! I am so excited to try something new. Work dinner/ breakfast. Whatever it is you  want to call it. We are doing the do. Let's get it!!!"}
