{"text":"I had a good overall experience at Hudson's - except the food. I like to try foods that seem a bit unique to the restaurant and opted for the \"PB&J Burger\". It seemed super unique but also a bit odd. So I asked my server, and she said \"people who love PB love this burger\".

I love peanut butter. But this burger was disgusting. The jam/bacon sauce was revolting and the peanut butter just overpowered the whole thing. Take it off the menu. 

I will say that my mate tried another burger, BBQ, bacon and cheese. He thoroughly enjoyed it. 

The server was good and the atmosphere was good...but the PB&J has to go."}
{"text":"I loved Gerry's (and miss it), so I vowed never to set foot in Hudson's.  Well, a couple weeks ago a friend asked me to meet her there...I was so disappointed!  The interior looks nice enough (dark wood paneling and canadiana-kitsch art) but it was full of drunk yuppie bros and I was not feeling the vibe at all.   The music ranged from shit I could get behind (Gnarls Barkley) to completely inane (soulDecision?!) and at 9pm when I got there, was so loud I had to yell over it.  There were tonnes of tvs all turned to the same thing--sports!  The menu was fairly comprehensive, some dishes with cute local names, but kind of expensive and not very friendly to this vegetarian! I ended up getting some 11.00 potato skins but paying that much for 6 wedges was kind of a rip-off, though they tasted fine.

I convinced my friend to hoof it out of there and we headed over to the hop-in-brew for a much nicer scene.  what a relief!"}
{"text":"It's a taste of downtown in the suburbs. The Crowfoot location has the same level of polish as the downtown version.

The food and drink selection is above average for a pub and the Flames game day specials make for a reasonably priced wing night. There are plenty of TVs and the service has always been good when I've been there."}
{"text":"Their home brew, Bale House, is my new brew!  Thanks for the suggestion of the Maple Bacon wings!!  Yum"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly, quick service, even during busy times!

Delicious beer, 6.25 for a pint

HUGE nacho servings, overall good food, a little higher priced that ordinary pubs but good!

Some booths have private tvs - excellent!

Attractive interior.

Overall setting - very easy to spend hours and hours drinking your way across Canada :)"}
{"text":"Normally I am a big fan of Hudson's. The food is good and reasonably priced. Never had an issue with service at any location. 
That being said DON'T BOTHER COMING HERE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. I'm not sure if it's just this location or all of them, but they're trying to pretend they're a nightclub on Saturdays. The music was insanely loud due to their \"live dj\" who played the worst music I've ever heard. Even yelling to my my friend sitting directly across from me, we could barely hear each other. Pretty frustrating experience considering they are well known as a good pub atmosphere."}
{"text":"Tried to go to Hudsons tonight (Friday approx 11pm) as I have heard great things. Walked over with a Palm Bay and threw the can away approximately half a city block from the line. After reaching the front of the line the bouncer humiliated me by saying I needed to go back for the can as he would be forced to fish for it later. Once I brought him the can he had told my friends I would not be \"allowed to enter having drank in public\". I was exhibiting no signs of intoxication, was not on Hudsons property, and was causing no havoc warranting being barred from a pub and humiliated in front of friends and strangers. After leaving with my friends, I learned it was empty inside and probably for the best that we made it somewhere else for midnight on a Friday."}
{"text":"Great Staff; very, very attentive.  Manager is always accommodating (switch the TV to my favorite game).

The bad news...always out of my faves and they just advised that they stopped serving Trad from Big Rock!!

Have to go finish the afternoon of Stamps v Eskimos at Shanks after we only had one round.

They used to play audio for games (i.e. Labor Day Classic!), but this is no longer my favorite place.  I think it started to stray when pints dropped from 18oz to 16.5...really?  Who is in charge now?"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night to watch the hockey game (Go Canucks GO!)
 :-)
We luckily snagged one of the last tables and settled in with beers and food. Service was good, despite it being so busy! Food was decent, typical pub food. 

And then, after the game....a dance floor appears where our table once was! We finished our beers on the patio (great patio for a beer on a summer's eve...I will definitely be back patio season), and then headed inside to get our groove on for a bit. The music was great, too and soon the dance floor was full. 

Good times at Hudson's!"}
{"text":"We were thirsty and hungry and decided to give Hudson's another try. It wasn't that busy on a Monday night. There seemed to be a lot of staff.  We grabbed a table and a server came around to the two tables next to us. She never greeted or said anything to us. We waited and waited. We then went up to the bartender to see if there was anyone serving where we were sitting. The bartender went around the corner. A few minutes later, great the server seemed to be coming around. She stopped again to check on the other two tables and continued on her way again without acknowledging us. We had to leave as we couldn't get anyone to serve us. I eat out 3-4 times a week in various restaurants. I guess maybe because I was older than 20 they didn't want to serve me."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night for a quick bite and quickly realized that Hudsons is busy for a reason and it's definitely not for the food. The quality and portion sizes are sub-par, to put it nicely. I ordered the quesadillas ($11) and opted for the add-on side of fries ($2). I figured a $13 quesadilla with fries has got to be pretty good...and a safe bet at a pub. I was SO wrong. My order came out and i actually had to ask the server if that was what it normally looked like.  I counted about 10 french fries and the quesadilla was slightly larger than the size of a DVD, cut into four. It tasted like something I would've thrown together in my college days when I was living off $5 a day. Not inedible, but not something you would ever willingly pay someone to make for you. My fiance had the chicken spinach salad which was pretty standard and he seemed to enjoy it (hence the generous two-star rating). We noticed that most of the diners were having wings or burgers if they were having food at all, so maybe those are the things to order here. Service was mediocre except our server charged the wrong bill to my credit card and then overcharged me for our drinks -  she was really nice though. For vegetarians, the only options on the menu would be Provolone Sticks, Fries or Yam Fries, literally."}
{"text":"We visit here often the service has always been great. I too would like a better beer selection. Food has been good every time this is a comfortable place for an afternoon beer or few."}
{"text":"8 TV's and there all on the same Sporting event. Smh for a Sports Bar and known Hockey, Baseball and Football on you think there would be a Variety. Had 1 Beer which was Cold and Nice Waitress"}
{"text":"What a joke, same old generic food you get at every other chain restaurant. $15 for fish and chips and left as hungry as I came. What's with these places, they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on    Construction and the only thing they do well are chicken wings. I must be getting old."}
{"text":"Just like her big sister downtown, Hudson's Shawnessy attracts a rowdy crowd looking to have fun and pick up - at least on the weekends. While the average age of the patrons downtown is around 25, this venue seems to attract a fairly young crowd from middle to upper-middle class families living in the south. I've witnessed at least 30 18th birthdays at Hudson's Shawnessy.

During the week, it's not so bad. They have very good wings. Wing night is on Wednesdays. But if you're looking for a place to hang out on the weekends, don't come here. I paid  visit on a Thursday night looking for a chill place to have a beer and I was greeted with a drunk blond girl trying to fight the bouncer. It's a disaster pretending to be a nightclub.

Some people like it, some people don't. I come here because it's convenient, but I try to avoid it on weekends."}
{"text":"Not impressed! I had called Hudsons to book a table for my birthday a while back. The gentleman that answered the phone took down my information, and told me he would call me back soon to confirm my reservation. A few days pass, and I still haven't heard back from them. So I decided to call and see what was going on. Well, they apparently not only had no record of my reservation, they told me they are booked solid for the month! I told them that the gentleman I talked to said there was availability, to which the girl who answered laughed and told me tough luck. Clearly they couldn't care less about having my business as they are popular. But, I really didn't appreciate how they responded to the situation, as it could've been handled way better. There was no \"sorry\", nothing was done. Sometimes there are miscommunications, but they can be dealt with in a positive manner. Hudsons had no interest in rectifying the situation. I actually was telling a friend about it, and she told me the same thing happened to her! Oh well, I went elsewhere and still had a great time. Doubt I'll be venturing back to Hudsons anytime soon."}
{"text":"Second time visiting this location and both times have been extremely disappointed by he quality of the pub food. Service overall is ok. As a sports venue it is a good place but the pod is definitely not a differentiator."}
{"text":"The music was so loud it made my teeth vibrate. Never ever going back. I'll be deaf for a week! Couldn't hear myself think, never mind have a conversation with anyone. Its not a night club! I don't care how good the food is or isn't - in fact it hasn't even arrived yet! We checked the decibels with an app on an iphone and it was over 90dB which is in the range of hearing damage. The staff need to be wearing hearing protection."}
{"text":"You know what? This place isn't THAT bad. The wings are pretty decent, with lots of flavors. But on wing nights, they are not fresh. They sit under the heat lamp. The beers on tap have improved to include some local brews, such as Big Rock. But they don't go bold enough and include really exotic bottles like Alley Kat or any type of imported kristallweizen (if you like rickards white, good god, try a real weiss bier). The TVs are really lame; distracting. This place also has several CCTVs that loops with all their promos. They then put this on ALL tvs when there is no poker/NHLclassic/etc on TV, which is well intentioned but extremely stupid imo... just turn them off and stop trying to market everything...maybe the experience of talking to other people is an experience onto itself. The servers are just outright clueless and are a bit snide. We asked for some scotch and she had NO idea which scotch was available. Being Canadians, we just conceded to the mediocrity: \"ok, whatever well scotch you got.\" But she didn't know what well scotch was. She was unwilling to find help, or just admit that scotch (or basic bar argot) isn't her forte. Eventually, we went to the bar, asked the bartender to pour some J+B in a shot glass as per our request for three of the people at our table, and then have that server bring it up to us. Eventually this was done. It tasted like well tequila due to the poorly cleaned shot glass. Being Canadians, we bitched to the bouncer in passing about this (instead of actually complaining directly) while going out for a smoke, so he got the manager to comp all six of  us a round. +1 star for this place.

The interior reminds me of this Canadian theme bar I went to in Tokyo. Logically, one can assume this place is really an authentic foreign Canadian theme bar in Calgary. Regardless, this place in Tokyo was very contrived and had nothing on the walls but souvenirs, empty oil cans, miscellaneous kitsch, and photos of British migrants stealing our resources then taxing us without any type of representation, first wave feminists finding something to ruin, and colonial thugs standing proudly atop a conquered Native. You know, things that comprise Canada's proud heritage.. Hudson's is the same. Believe it or not, it is possible to decorate an interior in a Canadian fashion without kitsch on the walls. Look at the grad lounge at the UofC, local510, or the entire W Montreal.

If I could suggest somewhere for non-Canadians to have a good Canadian meal and experience, I'd tell them to go a block south to District. Way fresher and way more unique. But Hudson's isn't that bad of a place to change it up for us locals wanting to wine and dine in a place that resembles the garage of the sub-sub-urban home we never had.

TIP: Cheap wings on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Very busy night Saturday ! Honestly not my type of place. Very loud and unable to converse beyond shouting.

Waitress was very slow to serve. We waited over 20 minutes to order a drink aqnd she was not quick to come back. Indeed we orderd from another waitress who was not handling our area.Perhaps inexperience  or understaffed, not sure? But in a places like this the wait staff should get that the empty glasses get no tips. 

Chicken teriyaky salad was decent, though.

There was a very fast turn around of clients, again not what I would expect from a taphouse crowd.If service is good and clients are satified, they should be sticking around for a 2 to 5 hour shift. So why were there empty tables every 40 minutes?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while on a business trip.  Place was nice, food was good, I got a bacon cheddar burger which I choose chilli as a side, and a pepsi.  $15 plus tip.  A bit pricey compared to burgers in the US but it was tasty so no complaints."}
{"text":"A very good place to go with friends for some drinks! On the weekends it has a club atmosphere so it's really two venues in one depending on what you're in the mood for! The staff are friendly and an asset to the business. The food is also good! Cozy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We used to hit up the Hudson's downtown location quite often, but the novelty wore off after a while.

When we heard this location was finely opened, we figured we'd try it out - it was close to home anyways! After our conference (it was a Wednesday) we thought we could have a wing night here.

Parking is definitely a challenge - this location is at a strip mall with a small lot. We arrived around 4 so it wasn't too bad. However when we left, the lot was packed and there were people parked at the Rona across the street and coming over (Guarantee that Rona's \"parking police\" will be monitoring their lot around the clock the near future) 

Happy hour was on - YAYYYYYY, wing specials weren't till 6 - BOOOOOOOOOO
However, it was $4 off starters so we could still have some relatively cheap food. I went with the spicy sesame wings, my girlfriend got the sticky peanut and spicy wings and my boyfriend got the beef & cheddar mini burgers with a side of onion wings.

Food came out quick! Our wings were coated nicely with sauce - not dumped on like other places. And the burger and onion rings looked tasty - and they were!

We were never left empty handed with drinks and were checked on frequently even when the dinner rush started up.

I think their food is decently priced and the quality of the food and service are awesome - I think our love affair with Hudson's has been rekindled :)"}
{"text":"Nothing good to say ... Never ever go here .Management didn't do anything about service or the food.  You couldn't pay me to go here . hope this place goes bankrupt."}
{"text":"Just came from Hudsons south. Walked in and took a prominent table right in front of the doors to the patio. Waited 15 minutes before the gaggle of waitress figured out who's table it was. Finally one of them came out of the kitchen looking really pissed and said \"what do you want\". We gave our drink orders. At 5 minutes to 6pm (end of happy hour) I asked for another beer on happy hour prices. She took her time getting to the bar and then promptly walked by saying \"you just missed it\". I wasn't happy!
We ordered the fish and chips which in the past times we have gone there was very good, The fish is usually cooked well and the chips fresh. This time the fish were little chunks of what looked like leftover pieces they dredged up from the bottom of the package. The chips were stale and tasteless.The price charged for these plates was $17.50, way too much.
On top of all that the people beside us were loudly talking about dirty sex and where they liked to be licked!
This bar/pub has really gone down hill in the last couple of years and it's going to take me a long time to go back."}
{"text":"This one of my fave pub/club? Though quite expensive its quite understandable due to its location. Such a beautiful venue and always a great time. I'm not sure if its because of the place or the people you're with but it's a great place all in all. 

One of my favorites here is the patio open during summer times yet if you decide to stay in, its always okay. Theres bunch of tvs and a lot to see since the bar is literally in the middle of everything. And theres a small dance floor in the corner which I think is great it doesn't intrude to the ones who just wanted to talk and spend good time together. Friendly staff. The food though nothing special and the price is just reasonable. Not much to say or comment on.

When it gets way tooo too crowded, thats where everything pretty much falls apart. The music gets loud and loud or initially is already loud, therefore conversations becomes nearly imposible. Beautiful place though!"}
{"text":"Went there for a few beers and a bite with my girlfriend last week. The tables were full so we got the first beer at the bar. We tried their own beer which was on special. It wasn't great to be honest. Then we got a table. While the service was slow the waitress was friendly . We started with the pepperoni bites which were good. Nice & spicy! I got the beef dip which was tasty ( they use good beef) and my girl got some kind of sandwich which she said wasn't so good. Then she got a Caesar and I got a pint of Keith's. The Keith's was pretty bad I have to say. Tasted stale. Then my girlfriend said \"try my Caesar\". It was made from tomato juice NOT Clamato juice. I was quite shocked by this and she was kinda mad. I gave 3 stars but think 2.5 would have been more fair. She would have given it 1 star but my beef dip was good so I upped the stars to 3. She won't go again."}
{"text":"finally decided to give it a try, lots of tv's comfortable seating and quiet enough you can talk to friends.  Fast service, friendly staff.  Had appetizers and food,  both were served quick and came to the table hot. have good specials and found on their website if you sign up for thier emails, you get a free appetizer.  very good we will be back..  South Calgary Shawnessy Location,  Macleod Trail & 162nd ave,  Shares lot with Empire Theatre's,  parking is fun to find."}
{"text":"Hudson in the south is the greatest pub ever. there staff is amazing they put smiles on all faces. there all so welcoming and hommie!!!! This is my husband and I's go to place on the nights we wanna let loose and have a couple beers and laughs. great place to go to meet fun locals and make friends. there isnt any better place then hudsons south!. loveeee iittttt!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for Wednesday wing night which starts at 6:00pm. Good selection of pub food and beer with nightly drink specials. Service was good. The place wasnt overly busy but it has been on other occasions when the Flames are playing. Good value for money at this central location with ok parking a block away."}
{"text":"It was my 21st birthday and I decided to book at Hudson's for a Friday evening. I followed the process on their website and filled out the request forms for a celebration booking at their location. I immediately received an automated email saying they had received my request and I would hear from someone shortly to confirm my reservation. 

A week went by, and I never got a phone call. So I called two days before the event to see if anyone had gotten my request, I got on the phone with a really nice guy named James who was very helpful, and told me that my reservation hadn't been made, but he could book me in himself without needing to consult the people who check the emails. 

This is my first complaint, why have an online system at all if you're not going to stay on top of it? It's unfair that customers who are trying to book an event which will bring business to their establishment should have to jump through hoops to make it happen. 

James booked me a table and a \"birthday celebration package\" without issue, and I'm appreciative of his effort! 

We arrived that evening and the table and everything was set up just perfectly. We enjoyed the first hour or so of our evening, with about 15 of us at the table. That is until an older gentleman came and sat down at my reserved table and asked if he could sit there... I very politely told him we actually had friends sitting there who would be back any second. He told me he would move as soon as they came back, so I said it would be fine. 

The next thing that happened between myself (21 y/o female) and him (40 y/o male), was he spotted someone's receipt on the table, and me, not knowing this man, I asked him if he could please leave it alone as it was my friends and she needed it for her personal records. I picked it up off the table and he immediately reached across and snatched it out of my hands and said something I couldn't hear. 

My boyfriend seeing my frustration came and sat down next to me to make sure that the situation was under control, and this man immediately started getting aggressive with him and threatening him. Saying things like \"I have 3 assault charges and I'm not scared of you\" or \"let's take this outside little man\" also, \"I'll fight you right f'ing now\" my boyfriend is also a 22 y/o male, who never once entertained this mans aggressive behaviour. 

Then, another man joined the conversation, while his friend, threatened my boyfriend as well as other males in the party sitting near by. I went and got a male staff member to try and diffuse the situation, who quickly pointed out his manager was already involved. And his manager was standing next to the man who was threatening my boyfriend and friends (again, twice our age) letting this all happen and even arguing with us saying we were in the wrong by not letting him sit with us. Which I profusely said I had no issue with. It was the aggressive behaviour I was appalled by. 

The first man who was uttering threats was escorted away from the table, while my boyfriend continued to talk with the manager. My boyfriend blatantly asked him if the original man was a manager or owner or someone with power within the company, assuming he must be if he would be allowed to bully a group of customers with no consequence. The manager just said to him, \"he hangs around here and is worth millions\", with no further comment on it. 

The manager then proceeds to turn to me, and tell me that this whole situation could have been avoided if I had just let him sit down and pay the bill he snatched out of my hands earlier. To which I replied, that his friend had never mentioned anything about paying bills, and that would not have absolved the situation anyways. It was the simple fact that, he sat down as an uninvited and completely rude interruption to our evening. But still, there was the manager arguing with a customer on her birthday, about her apparently poor behaviour. I was obviously shocked and horrified to find out that even though I was a paying customer who brought upwards of 15 people with me to his business, each paying over $60 each that night, that I could still be talked down to and made to find fault in. 

Needless to say, my birthday evening was completely ruined by an absolutely inebriated man, and his friend (also manager apparently), and was not made right when the manager sent over a round of shots for the table trying to fix things. It was more so insulting than anything.

And lastly, that our waitress, Jillian, would have the audacity, to whisper to my boyfriend, when half our party had already paid and left because they were horrified and justifiably pissed off about the evening's events, \"Don't walkout on the bill\"....

To end my rant, this whole establishment is completely unprofessional, and does not treat their customers with any sort of respect. The fact that a manager would stand by while a belligerent friend of his would get in my boyfriends face and scream at me is insanity."}
{"text":"It was Saturday and what do you do when everyone is busy but you still want to have a beer and a bite to eat? My idea was to hit up Hudson's near my humble abode. 

I strolled over around 6:30 and was quite happy with the two joyful hostesses. They smiled and just said \"Come in and sit wherever you like!\" There was no judgment, none of the \"is your party waiting?\" or the \"oh, you're alone?\" looks. It was nice considering my last experience going to a pub alone. 

I sat at the bar and was greeted by another sweet gal; she explained the specials and gave me time to look over the menu.

Afterwards one of the guys working behind the bar came over and took my drink order while I perused the food menu.  I must say however, I was greatly disappointed by the selection of beer! Wasn't this supposed to be a \"Canadian tap house\"? Where were all the great local beers and further all the imports? 

After I made my commitment to ordering the beef mini burgers I gave out my order to the same person (I didn't actually get his name, but wish I did so I wouldn't have to keep typing out \"that guy\") mostly because I wanted to give him a shout out. Not only did he have great bartending skills but he was also great at keeping everyone company around the bar and keeping up will all conversations, ours included. It made me feel a bit more welcomed and relaxed since sometimes I feel awkward sitting at the bar alone.  

On one further note about the service, let me just say everyone seemed to be on the ball and pleasant. It was a nice atmosphere to be around people that enjoyed working in hospitality.  
Now, food time... My first thought when my mini burgers (or sliders) arrived was \"they're so cute I don't even want to eat them!\" the presentation was great and I got them in a fast time frame. The one thing I didn't like though was that the burgers were quite greasy, while biting into them I noticed that grease would drip out in every bite... The fries that came with were the standard pub fries you expect. 

It started to get really busy around 8:30-9:00PM, all the tables and stools were full and it was getting loud with the flames game and everything. So my solo trip at Hudson's was finished. But I am definitely going to come back again with friends or by myself - just next time i will try something less beefy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Hudson's!!! We are semi regulars there. The staff there are soooo friendly and nice, and they even know what we are drinking before we sit down and they serve it promptly. The food there is typical pub food but it's delicious!!! They have specials everyday. I highly recommend this establishment!!!"}
{"text":"This Is a great local pub in Crowfoot. I remember their grand opening and waiting in line for Free wings for a year... Yeah... that was awesome! 

Been a regular ever since because their wings are really good and unique tasty flavours too. Overall, food is actually great for a pub and I tend to get their spicy shrimp salad... Amazing! 

Good place for lunch and business meetings in the area. Sometimes the coffee shops are packed and Hudsons has lots of booths to sit and chat about work."}
{"text":"great food/beverage specials!

definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I like the Shawnessy Hudsons better than this one. This one has a weird layout. And is smaller. But whatever, I still go. Why, you ask. Well, you'll have to read the rest of the review and get to the end to find out. 

There is a massive lineup every weekend! Its ridiculous! I hate lineups, so I usually go around 7 or 8. The music is always so damn loud its impossible to talk to the person sitting right next to you without yelling so much that you're hoarse by the time you leave the pub. But you know what I gotta say? They do have a great atmosphere. Everyone always looks like they're SO HAPPY to be there and they're having SUCH A GREAT TIME DUDE!

The service is always good - the waitresses are friendly and on top of their game, even though the place is packed like sardines in a can.

Why do I go there? I got gift certificates to use up. QUITE a few of them. And they all expire end of this year. So there is a good chance I'll end up here this weekend. If you're there too, come say hi. I'll buy you a beer.

{"text":"Some girlfriends of mine set up a double birthday party there for myself and another friend.  They had reserved us a booth.  Upon arrival we decided it was not in a great spot(right next to the dance floor and not big enough), so the manager moved us to a big back corner booth.  He also gave both us birthday girls each a $30 gift card for and a round of shooters for all that were in attendance with us at that time, which was about 10 of us.  

I've been to Hudson's a few times and I always have fun there.  I like the pub atmosphere with the option of going dancing if you choose... although if you leave it to super late it's like dancing in  a sardine can.  The dance floor is pretty tiny for how big the place is.  

If you plan to go there, go before 9/9:30 or you're more than likely waiting in line up.  I've never seen that place not busy.  Even one Monday night I was out for food with a friend and it was still rather busy.  No line up, but busy.  A number of the Stampeders players were out that night for food and drinks.  Its was fun watching the grown men sitting next to us ack like a bunch of groupies.  

I've never not had a good time at Hudson's and my birthday party was a very memorable night!"}
{"text":"K, its another of those suburban bars which are probably HOTSPOTS for suburbians. Or not. I don't know, but heck, there is always a lineup outside if you happen to get there after 9:30pm. Which is rather strange because once you finally get in, you realize that almost half the bar is empty. I'M ON TO YOUR MARKETING PLOY, HUDSONS! HAH!

The service has always been pretty good. Waitresses are helpful, and offer answers if you ask them questions. Infact, you should go on Thursdays because most beer and wine are $4 per glass. That's a pretty sweeeeeet deeeal! 

The food is nothing to write home about. Nothing at all. I have had better pub grub at other pubs. The cooks here are perfectly nice guys, but maybe they need to change their menu. Oh but their wings are GREAT! 

The music is a bit too loud for any kind of conversation. So clearly, this is a place to go, get smashed, and probably hook up. In fact, every time I'm there, I see several make-out sessions happening in several corners of the bar. One of my favourite things at Hudsons, other than the cheap-ish drinks on Thursdays is the personal TVs you get at every booth. Ya man!

I avoid busy nights (Wednesday, Friday and Saturday) just because I'm not a fan of crowds so I'm normally there on a Sunday for dinner.  The prairie top sirloin steak dinner is absolutely delicious! Only once did it not come out prepared as I like it, but they were quick to get me a new meal and comp'd my dinner as well :) that wasn't necessary but the great service and attitude I receive is what keeps me coming back! Keep up the great service and great food Hudson's!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Friendly atmosphere. Highly recommend the Loaded French onion dip. Erin was awesome.!!!!"}
{"text":"We went out with friends for drinks and wings (they chose the place this time) on a Thurs night at 730pm and we had a great time!
Initially it was very loud inside, the games were blasting from the TVS and the last table in the place that we scored had a speaker right above it. Yes, I lost my voice over the course of the night but we had so many laughs it was worth it. It quieted down a bit a little later on.
The service was amazing for an hour or so until our waitress was off duty - so we paid our tab and were ignored after that until we flagged someone else down.
No complaints about the wings really - they were half price and had about 10 flavors to choose from. I highly recommend the Ancho Chipotle and also the Maple Whiskey BBQ wings. Very good. 
Ooh, and so was the salt and pepper wing that I tried. 
And the hot wing...  yummy! 
The wings were smaller but still meaty, fresh and not overcooked as you find at other places that are just cranking them out. 
The drinks were half off too on some beers and all wines except for the most expensive red and white on the menu. I was very happy with my 5oz glasses of sweet German white to go with the wings. 
Our table killed 6 baskets (1 pound of wings = 10 wings or so) and then we ordered a basket of fries after that. They were so good! We were told that the kitchen changed to red skin potatoes which just make for a darker, tastier fry, skins on! The tables next to me got nachos and the platters were huge and looked sooo good! Next time...
For as many people as there were in this place, it was very clean and the bar-like decor was modern and pleasant to the eye. My friend also said the washrooms were surprisingly clean!
We have stayed away from here for 2 years since we moved the area for seemingly no good reason! Now that we know how awesome it is for just kicking back with friends, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Hudsons has introduced a new menu.  They definately kicked it up a notch or two.  Gone are the baskets of knifes and forks and condiments, less pub more casual dining.  The new Smoked Meat Sandwiche on Marbled Rye was amazing, just the perfect match especially with the new yam fries.  Can't wait to go back and see what else is up my alley."}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, went on wing night and there wings were very yummy. Great place to watch a Flames game. The staff was friendly but service was very slow, took forever to get my first beer."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service is unreasonably slow. We've stopped coming here before movies/concerts because we're guaranteed to be late as a result of the slow service.
Though the service is slow, it is friendly."}
{"text":"Came to Hudsons on a Wednesday night, same day I arrived in Calgary to meet with some friends for wing night and apparently, Wing's are big in Calgary on Wednesday. Wing Wednesdays at Hudsons is $0.25 wings! WHERE DO YOU FIND THAT IN LA? Even Buffalo Wild Wings on Tuesday nights for Wing Tuesdays is $0.55 per wing! So as my buddy and I are waiting for more friend, our friendly, Stampede themed waitress asked us about drinks and I ordered a pint of Alexander Keiths (because we don't have that in the States and I had it at a Blue Jay game). After that beer I was getting a little hungrier and I ordered some wings (orders of 10) and because I am in Canada, I had to represent so I got the Maple BBQ sauced ones, and it was pretty delicious a tad on the sweeter side. I then ordered a local Calgary beer for my second drink a Wild Rose Raspberry Ale and it was a nice beer, different from ShockTop Raspberry that it wasn't as flavorful but it was really light, clean, natural tasting and full of natural raspberry taste. Then ordered 20 more wings and 10 of them I got Honey Garlic and 10 of them Ancho Chipotle. For the Honey Garlic wings I didn't really taste the garlic just tasted the honey and it was STI-ICK-Y, the Ancho Chipotle was nice in that it wasn't too spicy had a nice smokiness to it probably from the ancho or chipotle or both, and it had a nice slight kick to it. My last drink of the night is another Canadian beer from the Maritimes, in New Brunswick... this beer reminds me of a Sea Dog Blue Paw and it was tasting a bit like Dimetapp at first but I enjoyed t towards the end. During the night, apparently there was an explosion at SHAW (internet, cable, phone service provider) so the credit card machines were down at the time, but the waitresses handled it awesomely and resorted back to carbon copy ruling the credit card which I have not seen in ages! The waitresses were pretty responsive to our needs and brought us a bucket for utensils and wet naps and we could even use the bucket for the bones of the wings. I really enjoyed this Hudstons and will definitely be returning.

**The wings here are great as in their not overly breaded unlike some other places, in fact their not breaded at all but super crispy**"}
{"text":"A good local pub in Shawnessy - it's nice to have more pub-style restaurants for us suburbanites!  

Hudson's has a great Canadiana atmosphere, overall good selection of beers and wines, and a decent menu.  The majority of the meanu is true pub-style fare - don't expect a lot of healthy eats here!  So naturally I had to indulge in the Lobster Grilled Cheese...because I can't say No to lobster OR grilled cheese!  And every bite was delicious! 

I would come back - Hudson's has a good vibe and nice patio as well for sunny summer days."}
{"text":"I don't know how long THIS location has been here, but I know when the downtown Calgary location was set to open, I remember hearing so much buzz about it, I expected something really amazing. I talked to friends from Edmonton, where they already had a few locations, and they made it sound like this was the bar to end all bars and it was going to be the best thing to ever hit Calgary. 

I still haven't been to the downtown location, but after seeing this one I can only describe it with one word... MEH.

Not only did I not see anything that really blew me away, I found myself incredibly underwhelmed. In most regards this place was \"just another bar\" - the wood on the counters and tables was nice, seemed probably new, and the decor was probably a bit nicer than average (though still no serious advantage) everything else I experienced was bland at best, when it wasn't all out negative.

First of all, before we even got in to sit down, we were being advertised to. The space where a lot of comparable establishments would have someone greeting you and helping you find a table was instead filled by a woman who (without so much as a \"Hi\" or \"How are you?\") was thrusting fliers at people for some challenge they were doing that week across the chain where, if you eat a certain number of hot wings under a certain time limit, you get entered in a draw to win a trip to Toronto. Granted, you still paid for the wings, and from the number of people I WITNESSED trying this, just in the half hour or so we were there, I can guarentee they drummed up more than enough food revenue to have covered a much bigger and more exciting prize. Furthermore, it seemed the conversation I was having with the young lady I was there with was being interrupted every 5 minutes (or sometimes less) by a staff member feeling the need to call the attention of the entire establishment to the fact that another patron was entering the challenge (and then again a few minutes later when 3-4 staff members would gather around the table and start counting down the seconds to when the time limit would expire). This was incredibly annoying, and detracted from our talk so much we ended up leaving much earlier than we'd planned and heading over to the Starbucks in the Chapters nearby.

Even while we were there I found the prices higher than average, and the bartending to be highly inconsistent (my first drink was mixed incredibly weak, while the second was so strong i was cringing with every sip). We were GOING to order food, but it took less than 10 minutes for us to decide (due to the distractions) that we weren't going to be there long enough to bother, so I can't speak to that aspect.

All in all, I can safely say I doubt a second visit would be as annoying, once this whole challenge was done with, but I really didn't see anything that made me terribly excited to come back, either. Perhaps someday I'll check out the downtown location and see if it's any better, but this one certainly didn't live up to the hype I was given.

{"text":"First thing's first: don't come here on a Sunday if you don't like football. Period. No questions asked.

My date and I made that mistake, walking in at about 2pm on a Sunday for a late lunch, and we could barely hear ourselves thing, let alone eachother talk, and it wasn't even all that busy. It was ALL coming from the TVs playing the game. 

The service wasn't terrible, but far less than stellar as every visit seemed to take at least twice as long as it should have for a place with this ammount of people.. In fact, after dropping off the check, the server disappeared long enough for us to finish our drinks, get out jackets back on and sit for just short of 10 minutes waiting before we finally decided we had to get going to make the movie we were heading to and went up to the bar - only to have 2 bartenders completely ignore us. It wasn't until a guy in a suit who'd come around twice to ask us how everything tasted (I assume he was a manager) finally saw us that we were able to pay and leave.

The food was good... I've had much better, but for slightly higher-aiming pubfare (I had Bob & Doug's Club and my date had the Avacado and Bacon Burger) it was acceptable.

All in all it was okay for a lunch on a Sunday, but if I were in the area again I'd rather cross the street and head to The Keg or Tony Roma's than come back."}
{"text":"Great food Great beer Amazing service! I highly recommend visiting this location. The pub is very clean and has that old wooden pub feel. All around had an amazing experience there if I could give it 10 stars I would. I started off with their Coconut chicken curry soup which was amazing and served with garlic bread. Then i had the Three Sisters Sliders and a side of awesome Quebec style poutine (im from montreal so it passed the test) which were great as well and washed that all down with a pint of Lumber Jack lager. Then had a skillet cookie with a vanilla bean scoop of ice-cream and caramel drizzle to top off my meal and I left very happy."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here on a busy Friday night.  The hostesses were very pleasant and helped us find a table(it was a half hour wait, but we seated ourselves at the bar and were promptly served beer and Strongbow ciders).   Once we were at our table, we ordered five kinds of wings(crunchy peanut, honey garlic, salt and pepper, not so hot, whisky barbecue).  Our server was friendly, efficient and amazing(she kept track of all our drink and food orders without writing anything down)!   The wings were delicious, and so were the sweet potato fries.  Chicken quesadillas were pretty ordinary.     
       However, it was very noisy.  The music was playing at full blast and you have to shout at each other to have a conversation.  Parking is also a bit of a challenge.  The best thing you can do is wait for someone to leave and just muscle in..."}
{"text":"I go here for drinks and to eat sometimes and have always had consistently good service. Nothing extremely memorable but my expectations are met. Waitresses have always been friendly and attentive. The food is better than I expect for pub food and they have a good selection of beer. Prices are on par."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We here last night for a few drinks and some dinner. Our food was very good, but when it came to paying for our drinks and food afterwards the waitress decides she wants to enter her own tip percentage before handing me the machine! She made my decision for me? I called her out asking why would you enter your on tip on my card? She told me that it was a girlfriend which was a complete lie!ill go back and be sure to tip zero next time :) very unprofessional, service was terrible! I also work in the food industry this is my first time ever seeing a waitress do that."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Everyone on earth seems to love this place right now. I dislike how busy it gets late at night, but that's not really a bad thing now is it?! 

The food and service are average for a pub. I don't typically think \"LETS GO TO HUDSONS\", unless someone else I know will be going there!"}
{"text":"**This review rating is subject for me being there when Hudsons isn't in club-mode (aka late night)**

I've always enjoyed Hudsons locations as they usually have great food for fairly cheap prices. This location did not disappoint me and had great wait staff that were very friendly and outgoing. There was lots of room in the place, so our large party group was easily seated in the back area of the bar. We were able to socialize in a relatively average level of background noise so we could still talk.

Fast forward to a couple of hours later, we're asked to move to the front of the pub so that they could close the back. This was a bad sign. Cue club mode. I had spent enough time at other Hudsons to know that you should leave when it's converting to club mode but it's normally not as bad as this location. The way this Hudsons is laid out, you cannot continue conversation at that point. Just pack up and head out.

Come to Hudsons for lunch, supper, or early night drinks but plan to head somewhere else before it gets too late."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of the Hudsons chain and I'm glad to see them in Calgary as well as Edmonton.

The Shawnessy location lives up to the reputation that Hudsons has established in my eyes. The food was delicious (we had a poutine and some mini-burgers) and the various drink choices are always interesting. It was a nice day so we fortunately had the experience of sitting out on the patio. Although it was a Stampede weekend, it was still quite busy and we still received great service. All of the staff were very nice.

If you like good traditional Canadian food (steaks, burgers, etc.) then head over to Hudsons and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good food & you can't beat a great selection of beer also! The honey mustard served with the chicken strips is amazingly tasty & the onion rings are some of the best in town. If you want great service sit in Maddi's section!"}
{"text":"Finally a pub with a bit more class than.... some of the others in the area (we all know where I'm talking about) I often visit Hudsons after a tough day at work, and the food NEVER dissapoints. The service is great as well! For sure worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Hudson's ofers a large space, jammed with tables and big screen tv's on top of cold drinks and okay food as far as I know. That's all I wanted last night when I went in there. I had my jersey on and I was going to support my team while having a few drinks with friends. With indifferent expectations, I ordered the quesadilla for a little in between beer snacks. I feel like I've been throwing this around a lot lately, but it was seriously the Best Quesadilla I have ever eaten. Large fresh slices of tomato and avacado with corn, black beans, cilantro and nice chunks of juicy chicken. I didn't eat that MF'er with a drop of salsa or sour cream either,  I liked it so much.

Black beans have really stepped up their game on my pallet lately. Way to go Hudson's."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night while visiting Calgary for the weekend.  Our friends we were with insisted that we show up early to avoid a long line and i'm glad we did because we got right in. This place had a great crowd mostly 20-30. There is a small dance floor with awesome music. The bar staff was friendly and quick with the drinks. Overall had a great time here 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Yes it's a bit loud, yes the speakers are poor, the people frat like loud, but the beer is cheap and tastes great, not to mention cold...

Had a shepards pie yesterday and the steak sandwich today and loved them both along with a 4.00 pint wow! 

Some may say the portions are small, but hey, we all eat too much and these are just right in my books! Not mention the prices are good too.

If I am back this way I will be here!"}
{"text":"Stopped here randomly during a walk for lunch.

Sitting at the bar, I received quick service and had the beer sampler which was very good. 

I ordered the steak, which was on special. Medium rare, the best temperature. I'm generally very iffy when ordering steak, as it's screwed up 90% of the time I do. I took that chance.

Well, it was terrific. Juicy, delicious and perfectly cooked. I went at the thing like a hungry lion. 

The atmosphere is good, the service is great and the steak is yummy. Cows are going to be hiding in fear now that I know where to get great slabs of them."}
{"text":"I stay away from Hudsons after 7 when the teenagers start popping up as it becomes a nightclub atmosphere at night, however I don't mind it during the day.  I'll average out my rating between both visits as the first time wasn't very good but this time was great.

Their summer specials were an interesting mix of Stampede/summer inspired dishes.  I locked my eyes on an item when I noticed mac and cheese bacon sandwich.  No! You're messing with me aren't you, Hudsons?  Turns out they weren't.  It was piled with macaroni and REAL cheddar cheese and slices of bacon.  The bread was browned nicely and the sandwich was very good.  I was impressed by how filling it was.  I washed it down with a drink that was a bit girly but delicious called the John Candy.  The service was great and I was happy that our server was also the cutest there.  BONUS!

I'll definitely stop by again before summer's end."}
{"text":"Very good experience here, food was up quick and was great portions size. Had the fish and chips and the cob salad. Was more than enough for two. Place is loud as said in another review but it was also packed on a Wed night. Natasha was our sever and did a great job!"}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night so the place was in full club mode. Therefore didn't get a chance to try the food. 

It was fine for what it was. The DJ was good. I felt old, but the crowd was good and I just stayed out of their way and enjoyed my drinks with my friends."}
{"text":"Honestly had low expectations but it was BUMPING. Went there on a Friday night, lots of good throwbacks but some questionable choices on songs."}
{"text":"We order food from this location via Skip the Dishes super regularly and it never disappoints. Never. We have a newborn at home and have been living on take out and let me tell you, Hudson's is our go to! The peanut butter burger is the bomb. My partner prefers the Canadian burger and we both love the buffalo chicken dip."}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to try the fare here at Hudsons due to a corporate function.  We had their cheap wings - honey garlic and salt and pepper - and a huge platter of nachos.  The wings were not bad.  Comes with a ranch dip.  The nachos were just OK.  It looks like a huge pizza of nachos.  The only thing I didn't like was that the dips were not brought out with the nachos so we had to wait for a bit.  Meanwhile the nachos got cool.  Didn't taste right then.  

Then we ordered our lunch items.  I had their Top sirloin steak, rare with double steamed brocolli, sauteed mushrooms, sweet potato fries and aioli.  It was not bad.  The meat was not seasoned enough for me and had to dip in HP sauce.  

I didn't order any alcohol so I can't comment on that.

The wait staff was kinda attentive especially when it came to drinks.

Lots of TVs for sports events.  Lots of Canadiana hung on the walls all over the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with an old university friend for some pub food and beer! Tonight (Tuesday) was east coast night meaning fish and chips (a few bucks off) and shrimp basket ($2.50 for 12 shrimp) a steal was great! TV's had sports on. I was more tired tha. Hungry so I had the shrimp basket plus a Caesar salad. I asked the waitress if the Caesar was overly garlicky and she stated \"not really\". Shrimp was great but Caesar was pretty strong garlic. Maybe that's my fault for ordering but oh we'll. One other small suggestion is the smell of stale beer plus unpleasant smell was not overpowering but definitely noticeable! Price of food was decent! Beer price average! Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure that I should be reviewing Hudson's, since I don't know how representative my feelings about this place are.  I had a throughly mediocre time here, but if I were to judge from the fact that there was already a lengthy line to get in at 9:30p, and still a line at 1:00a, then I have to admit that this place apparently resonates with a lot of people.

In any case, Hudson's is currently Calgary's resto-pub hotspot, with a thriving happy hour and an even more thriving night-out scene on weekends (and possibly during the week) .  The food is typical pub fare, the drinks are priced at a small premium, and the crowd is 20-35, 97% white, and 98% drunk.  The dance floor is small, and the music was poorly selected and even more poorly mixed (think bad frat party) on the Friday night that I was there.

If this were my kind of scene, I might rave about Hudson's.  As it is, though, I find it unimaginative, dull, and an unwanted throwback to my university days."}
{"text":"Went to Hudsons for a midweek lunch, since it is so close to the office.  Service was great, seated quickly and visited by the kitchen manager halfway though the meal \"just making sure we were happy\". Food was fair, but I have to say that I am not their target demographic.

Ordered the hot dog, cause I love Hot dogs, and because everything else on the menu just seemed like too much. (it seems every place with in walking distance of my beltline office is geared for 250 lb man appetites, and expense account budgets. Seriously, just because Earl's has decided to audaciously raise prices and lower quality, why must everyone else?)

So...I should have read the description more carefully.  Deep fried all beef battered wiener, beer mustard (tasted like cheese sauce from a pump), bacon jalapenos and fresh tomatoes. Really? Nothing was wrong, it was all fresh and tasty enough separately, but I just did not understand nor enjoy it all together. 

Next time, I will walk further and hopefully find a hot dog stand.

Sigh"}
{"text":"The service is good. The Canadian themed menu is funny and tasty and the patio is fantastic. It's away from the traffic and has the sun all afternoon. Great place for a weekday beer and lunch."}
{"text":"I've been to Hudson's south mostly only on Flames night and the odd Friday. For the most part I enjoy myself there. I've found the staff to be very friendly and for the most part prompt. The food is pretty decent and it's priced pretty much the same as anywhere else. On weekends the crowd is a little younger so I tend to stay away but it still is a good time. If you're in the deep south, I would recommend Hudson's as one of your top 3 choices.

{"text":"The absolute worst. Server took over 10 mins to  initially approach us, took another 15 minutes to get the first round. Food came within 30 mins (not bad for a busy Thursday evening) but was bland and overall quality did not match price. We had to chase down a server to get another round....honestly an all around bad experience. Seemed like nobody cared about how we felt (4 women in our late 20's- early 30's)"}
{"text":"This place is jumping! Good menu but the kitchen is hella slow when the place is busy.  We waited an hour tonight for wings and the game wasn't even on yet.  Better go to Rips or Jack Astors instead."}
{"text":"I love this bar! I moved to Calgary couple months ago, and since the first time I visit Hudsons it was a good experience. Food is delicious, they have a great variety of beer and my favorite part...the service is great! 
 I sometimes just go for a beer at the bar alone and the girls at the bar are very friendly. I highly recommend this place! 
Oh! And btw their blackboard at the entrance is really funny, it really makes me laugh all the time!"}
{"text":"The menu didn't appeal to my appetite too much. 

But....the Spicy sesame wings were good. Good size, came out hot, and was not dry. 

The Shrimp special looked good too. 

Grapefruit beer and blueberry beer was good 

Super busy due to hockey game last night. 
Ok for once in awhile...."}
{"text":"Its a great chill bar to relax and enjoy a beer with friends. They have free wifi, the service staff are great (shout out to Ami, who remembered what I drank the last time I was there), the beer is cold and reasonably priced with a good selection on tap.

Parking is a challenge sometimes and don't even think of trying to park in the adjacent natural foods place, because it has a wannabee rent-a-cop who will hunt you down during busy times. Better to just park across the street at Rona/Lowes if necessary and play Frogger with the busy traffic when crossing the street.

The food is decent pub grub. Nothing award winning but gets the job done well."}
{"text":"Hudsons is always a great atmosphere. Customer service on point. Food is good quality and price. They do special promo for birthdays which is really nice. Love it here"}
{"text":"Had my first Hudson's experience today. Absolutely loved it!!! I ordered the PB&J burger and something just didn't taste right after a few bites. I'm sure it was my own taste buds. Anyway, they went above and beyond to correct it. Was sooo impressed by their customer service. I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  The service was okay at first but dropped off over the course of the night.  The TVs were way too loud.  Conversation was next to impossible.  Some annoying announcer kept talking (even louder than the TVs) every 20 minutes or so.  It sounded like Lynch from X92.9.  He was annoying, so it wouldn't surprise me if it was.

I probably wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"My husband and his co-workers booked Hudson's for a birthday celebration !
Three of them were having birthdays that week and based on YELP reviews, Hudson's seemed like a good spot.
The table that was reserved had balloons on it and the three birthday guests received 30$ gift cards! What is cooler than that!!
The service was actually really  great and there was trivia and prizes based on the Flames and the Jets (who were playing that night on all the tvs)
There wasn't a bad spot in the house to watch the game, and the big screen in the back was super clear and awesome.  
Little chicks in referee outfits went around getting everyone to fill out a little form to guess who would score the first goal for the Flames- too fun.
I ordered the maple syrup and bacon poutine.  Ohhhh boyyyyy.  My arteries were clogged and I'm pretty sure my heart stopped, but I was in heaven.  Cheese, warm maple syrup and yummy fresh fries with crispy bacon pieces.  Aaaa ouuuuu gaaaaaa!  I will definitely be going back for wings and another game night.  Don't know if I'll head there on a Fri or Sat night though as a line was forming when we left :S"}
{"text":"I have only been here twice but both times we had excellent service and good food.  Last time we went was on wing night and as expected they were busy but that didn't effect their service.  We had a very knowledgeable and helpful server who assisted me in choosing the sauce for my wings.  We also had about 5 others servers come over and make sure we had what we needed.  Someone was always refilling our drinks and our food come out fairly quickly considering how busy they were.  The only  thing I could say they should improve on is their hostesses.  They were not friendly and were actually a little rude when we joked with them."}
{"text":"Starting off by saying I will likely update this to a 5, but for now the only food I had during their Friday happy hour prices were the wings (2 plates of hot, one plate of the maple rub) - coupled with way too many vodka/sodas.

I walked in thinking that even if not that great I would will it to be great because it is across the street from my building and would likely come here often.  I was quite surprised as to how large it was but at the same time feeling warm - probably all the wood and level of lighting.  Plenty of TVs for sports, and seemed like they had a long list of beers to choose.  Sat in the back and the hostess was super cool about changing one of the screens from hockey (a hanging offense, but my Mets were playing game 3 of World Series) to the baseball game.  The waitress, Annie, was amazing - quick to suggest specials, types of wings, letting us know which liquor was included in the special and just a general overall friendliness I've come to expect in Canada.

The rest of the menu items were very intriguing, will be back soon for some heavier fare and my expectations are high."}
{"text":"The chicken tenders were very good.  A tad overdone but that is better than the alternative.  The onion rings and pretzel breading was wonderful but the honey mustard was what made the dish.  The atmosphere was good.  Not too wild, but this could be because of it being a Sunday evening.  Previous reviews had us hesitant, but I'm glad we proceeded.  Maddi was our waitress and she did great."}
{"text":"Hmm... such a strange concept of a place.  It appears to be a nice pub with good drinks and a nice menu.  However, stay long enough and the place transforms into a hipster dance floor of tiny proportions.   Those who were there to sit and chat and drink get their ears blasted by the speakers for the small dance floor.  It becomes unbearable.   

Hudson's needs to find an identity and stop trying to be both a pub AND a club."}
