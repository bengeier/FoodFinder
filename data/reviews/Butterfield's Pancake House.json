{"text":"Fab.U.Lous. Best scrambles eggs. Fluffy and tasty. Servings so large teenage athletes had leftovers. Been to Scrambled, US Egg, and we all vote Butterfields. The orange juice is absolutely delicious. Everyone was so nice despite the packed place, and they were fast too. Try it, they won't disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  We had never been here, but read the good reviews.  I had 2 eggs with 3 link sausages, 2 pancakes and fruit.  I expected the usual under ripe melon or orange slice, but this had a small cup with 5 types of ripe fresh fruit--delicious.  My sister had the spinach and gruyere crepes--yummy.  The coffee is very good with individual pots of cream, and the service was very attentive.  Your coffee cup will never be empty here since, and you can watch them squeeze your fresh orange juice."}
{"text":"french toast is to die for and the gravy is down right yummy the only reason im giving this place 4 and not 5 is because the service could be better but I understand its crowded"}
{"text":"First time eating  here and it was tasty. We had a little bit of a wait because of its popularity but were seated within 5-10 minutes of coming in. Pancake=delicious!
I had the corned beef skillet and my friend had the California scrambler... sweet server and an overall great experience."}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast favorites, excellent service and clean restrooms (one of my benchmarks for attentive business owners)

Protein cakes and turkey bacon...yum!  My lady enjoyed the feta omelet and side order or fruit."}
{"text":"The food was okay and I didn't have the pancakes but I ordered a orange juice when I sat down and it ended up costing more than $5. 

On the plus side the lamps looked like waffles."}
{"text":"there is usually a long line of fine folks waiting tor tables at butterfield's. the food and service are worth the wait. perfect pancakes, superb smoothies, and close to hotels/lamps plus/scottsdale porsche."}
{"text":"My friend told me about this place. And after going there I have totally found a new awesome breakfast place. 

I always get an omelette and every omelette on their menu is great. Plus one of the biggest things for me is that they have Gluten Free Pancakes!!!!  Which are Heavenly. 

The service is always great. Very attentive staff, but not too much. I have never felt rushed or like I was being pestered. 

Food comes out speedy fast. and is always perfect to order. You can't go wrong going to Butterfield's. They are GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Ths place is fantastic.  We eat out about 5 times a week.  We go for the breakfast so I can't say about lunch.  The hostesses' are always smiling and friendly.  The waitstaff are prompt to your table and listen to what you order.  The Veggie hash is fantastic, I get it almost everytiime we go.  It has sweet potatoes, potatoes, corn, and brussel sprouts topped with 2 eggs any style.  Pancakes are also a great choice.  Coffee is hot, deliscious and your cup is never left empty. They make their ownl freshly squeezed orange juice.The place is always spotless.  The wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"We have heard about this place for quite a while. Given the friend reviews and the look of the building, one would think it was more of an upscale breakfast joint. Instead we were greeted to a large open restaurant that was very loud and with what seemed like a group of robot teenagers running the place. The sense of urgency (to be seated, take order, etc) was there (as they rushed us through every bit of our visit) but with no individuality or customer service. Autopilot. 

First, we are shown to a table that is not ready for us and we are left standing in the middle of the dining room. Very awkward. Then the waitress asks us what we would like to drink. Coffee for him, coffee for me and.....had to get her to stop the robot talk (and almost flag her down as she walked away) so I could order an OJ. Since it was our 1st time, we took a bit of time to decide what to eat. The open menu on the table with my face buried in it should have been the first clue I wasn't ready to order. But the robot-server came by 3 times ready to write everything down; and I mean everything, spelled out and repeated as she wrote. Wow... 

The food was OK. A little on the bland side, but tasty. The chorizo was very flavorful and the sausage gravy was excellent. The menu is extensive with something for everyone - French toast, crepes, pancakes, skillets, specialties and more). The food came out very fast which was good because we were hungry! 

Maybe my expectations were too high in general. I truly thought this place would have been nicer. If I want my check delivered to me in the middle of my meal, I would have eaten at Denny's. I was shocked and surprised."}
{"text":"Love their healthy options! It's nice to not to feel like you're making a compromise when you want / have to eat right. 

Waits on the weekends are lengthy, but I know when I'm looking for a tasty, non-gimmiky breakfast, I look for the line."}
{"text":"First, let me say how \" GREAT\" William, the server is ! He is amazing!!! This guy is
the \"best\"!!! The food is great, I recommend the apple Dutch babe it is wonderful! Only had one bad experience and it wasn't the restaurant's fault. This woman opens up a bottle of nail polish and starts painting her nails! Really ?!! Are you that inconsiderate?! This is a restaurant, not a nail salon and please try to remember your not at home!!!"}
{"text":"Butterfield's is in my neighborhood.   Have been a customer from almost their first day open. Rock solid breakfast. Lots of regulars there. All of the standards plus a few greats (the bacon skillet with poached eggs on top is a good one!) I have had breakfast at \"Butterball's\" (as my teenagers affectionally refer to it) probably in excess of 50 times.  If you are a hater, go somewhere else, more room for those of us who love good service, a smile and a breakfast that is as fit or fattening as you desire.  I have had just about everything on the menu, including lunch, and my only complaint is their coffee.  A bit bitter.  Love, love, love the OJ.  On Sundays, get there early before the post-church crowd...."}
{"text":"I had heard much about Butterfields in the past, words of scrumpchious eats and fresh brewed coffee, spoken with a glint in the eye and a smile from ear to ear. Endless tales of their impectible service and outstanding food, and after meeting a collegue of mine one early morning at this \"legendary\" spot, I can say with all certainty that what I heard does not do this wonderful establishment justice.

Walking in I was greeted with a warm smile by the hostess, while I'm never an easy riser, all displeasure with leaving my warm bed to face the day was gone when in no more than 5 minutes I was sat at a comfortable booth with a hot coffee in my hands, and my order on the way.

I ordered the Whole Hog Skillet and this glorious hot breakfast was on my table before I could finish my first cup of coffee. Speedy service with warm smiles and bright attitudes, I already felt that after this harty delicious meal I could handle anything the day had to throw at me. I knew I would need to visit this wonderland of breafast foods again, and since then each time has been greater than the last. Don't miss this incredible spot."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Especially the Mexicana omelette and the wild berry bliss pancake. The service was above and beyond."}
{"text":"I just love this place. 

Breakfast is always amazing and the fresh squeezed orange juice is so yummy. I wish the juice was a tad bit cheaper cause I would buy one everyday!

The pancakes are to die for! The only thing I didn't like was the eggs...I think they add water which makes them really fluffy! It's not bad but the texture grosses me out but I won't be dinging any stars because that's just my personal problem! 

If your in the area check this place out just make sure you go early or you have time to wait!"}
{"text":"Hadn't had the chance to make it back here in a while, but I'm glad I did. I just had one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. It was made up of traditional items, but just done very well. A Latte that rivaled any other in town and traditional Eggs Benedict. The potatoes that accompanied my dish were new, and they were awesome. Thanks for another great meal."}
{"text":"A less sketchy Denny's. The Baby Apple Pancake came out piping hot and delicious and the omelets are soooo fluffy! I don't even understand how they get them so light and airy! I really liked the food, even the cinnamon raisin toast came out hot and sliced thick. 

I like all the orange trees, I'm guessing they are fake but I'll investigate more next time.

This could get five stars from me but they played 4, count them, FOUR Nickelback songs in the time that I was dining, which was just way too much whiny sadness for my pancake feast."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great traditional breakfast food and reasonable prices! My fianc√© and I frequent this restaurant at least 2-3 times a month and are never disappointed. Portion sizes are big, services is good and fast and their quality of food is home cooked food. The only negative thing is this place is Very Popular and they are only open from like 6am to 3p and no matter what day or what time it is this place is buzzing and busy. Wait times can be a little long (max we've wait for up to 5 people is 15-20mins) and they don't take reservations or put your name on the list with out your whole party being present. BUT that is fine with me because that keeps the tables turning and people happy! I highly recommend you go here if your craving an amazing breakfast!!! Great food, reasonable prices and good service deserves to be recognized these days. Seems like more and more customer serves and restaurant quality is on a huge decline and it's very refreshing to find a great place."}
{"text":"When my wife's friend mentioned she would be choosing Butterfield's for her Saturday morning brunch, I figured the place would be decent. After several visits, I can honestly say I hope I never go to another breakfast restaurant. 

When you arrive at the restaurant, be prepared for a wait. The bigger the party, the longer the wait so I always recommend traveling in small groups or calling ahead (note: I haven't the slightest clue if they will even allow you to do so but it's worth a shot). Weekends will have the longest wait (obviously) however the time spent waiting makes the food even better.

On the most important topic, I have to say that I had an amazing omelet served with hash browns and pancakes. I had to do a double take on the omelet because of the shear size of it. No joke, it must have been 4 inches tall. My first omelet was graced with bacon and two types of cheese. With an omelet like this, the add-ins are not scarce. You can almost guarantee that each mouthful will be filled with all your choices. I know my mouth was. They have fresh squeezed orange juice and plenty of other tasty beverages available. 

I can't wait to return to try out other menu items. I recommend this place to all family/friends who visit my family for a great breakfast. Just be sure to get there early!"}
{"text":"We are updating our review to give Butterfield's and Yelp 5 stars.   We had given a one star review to express our concern that the servings of the delicious Swedish pancakes had shrunk substantially.  Shortly after we posted the review, the serving size returned to the original hearty serving.  We are back at Butterfield's and happy customers.  Thank you to Butterfield's for bring responsive to your customers. Kudos to Yelp.  It works !"}
{"text":"Great coffee, omelette and fresh orange juice. The only negative are the oversized sausages, too thick."}
{"text":"Mmm veggie hash. Mmm squeezed-on-site orange juice. Butterfields is a wee bit pricey but doesn't keep us from coming back. I am an eggs benedict freak and I can't review without saying.. if you love eggs benedict, these are just so-so. Fruit bowl is nice and huge and can be split between four easily, the waffles look amazing, but the veggie hash really isthe star of the show here for me. Rich (veggies, yes!), filling comfort food with two eggs on top.. over easy... oh my god yum.

Bacon waffle? How did I miss that? That, I have to have ;)"}
{"text":"So disappointed the Baked Apple Pancake is gone. My husband & I would make the 2 hr drive for it as we had nothing like it at the local restaurants. I even called the restaurant to see if they would still make it even tho not on the menu. The answer was an emphatic  \"no\". Will not be going back. You can get the usual breakfast items everywhere, ie. pancakes, omelets, etc. but the Baked Apple Pancake was unique."}
{"text":"Butterfields is a culinary masterpiece that has impressed my family and I over and over again. With an amazing price range and the best service I've had in years, anyone coming to this great family friendly  establishment will have a visit to talk about. My family and I actually have made Butterfields a weekly tradition, and the servers are always fast and do their job with a smile on their face. The food shows up incredibly fast, and the pancakes are to die for. I'll definitely be returning to Butterfields sometime soon, and I know it'll be worth the visit.

{"text":"Finally...a place that'll satisfy my pancake cravings!  

Maybe it was a fluke but we were seated in 10-15 minutes on a Sunday morning and our food came out surprisingly fast.  I had the S'moreo cookie cakes and they were delicious.  The pancakes were light, fluffy, not too sweet, and the amount of oreo cookie crumbles in the batter was perfect!  I also had a side of the corned beef hash to offset the sweetness of the pancakes and it was so-so.  My husband had the country benny and that was really good too (especially since the white country gravy was not too heavy).  We have to recommend the OJ as well. 

All in all, the breakfast we had was a great start to our day.  I can't wait to come back and try their other pancakes and waffles."}
{"text":"Rule #1 Do not go on Saturday or Sunday mornings- its insanely busy and crowded. But once again who has time to do a full breakfast during the week? 
Anyhow stopped by this place a few weeks ago with a good friend to have some brunch. The Fresh OJ was lovely, my friend went on some random eating binge which scared me. From omelet to toast to pancakes- Carb Deprivation possibly? I guess she really enjoyed her breakfast.
I had some Florentine hash brown with grilled chicken and poached eggs (PERFECT POACHED EGGS) was quite lovely. I did have a debate between Belgian waffles- and Benedict sandwiches. Its nice if your starving in the morning and want to have a hot meal waiting for you while you chat along with your friends/family/random stranger. 

I've been in the mood for a Belgian waffle but I keep forgetting to go back, odd. Now I find it hard to ever go back to my college buddy IHOP, this place is more than a few steps ahead !"}
{"text":"Great strawberry shortcake pancakes, hashbrowns, and eggs combined with efficient service, and a friendly atmosphere.  Highly recommend this place for breakfast - it closes pretty early."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the portions are Huge! They use very fresh ingredients and offer a wide variety of dishes. You might find yourself waiting in line on a Sunday morning but it is well worth it"}
{"text":"Super simple: great food, service and crazy fast. They are pretty amazing. I always get the gluten free. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! My husband and I shared the California scrambler and upgraded to the banana cream pancake. The portions were enough to feed both of us and our two little kids! It was delicious. We also tried the orange juice, which was definitely fresh squeezed, but so over priced for how much you get that we won't get it again."}
{"text":"Lets see. Our food came out super fast. They bring you   a water craft which i really like. Place looks like it has recently been renovated. The hash browns are more like potatoe slices which is fine since they were super crispy. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"What ever great comments you've heard; it's better than that.  Never ceases to amaze me.  And ditto on 8/17/16!
Enjoyed with my son as he completed his week at Brophy."}
{"text":"The California scramble was amazing
. The 2 times I have been there my servers were really friendly and efficient. Great place for a family breakfast. The only problem is because it is so good it's really hard to get in on Sunday morning ."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I had the multi-grain pancakes and shared a side of corned beef hash. Man, you never see corned-beef hash these days.

It's great! The lines are long and deep with lots of S'dale peeps, but if you can stand that -- it's worth the wait. I also love that they have sugar-free syrup on the tables."}
{"text":"This is the least favorite place for breakfast as they make you wait and wait. They only give you a vibrator if you have all your party. They are like  \"The Soup Natzi\". When I finally got called in and my son was in the bathroom they denied us a seating and when we asked again to be seated they said: \"No breakfast for you\"... It was funny and sad to see a business acting in such an arrogant way towards their customers. We left gladly across the street to \"The US Egg\" with no wait, better food and better service."}
{"text":"My kids beg to go to Butterfields! We live close. The service is always AWESOME! I have been there at east 100 times and only had bad service once, and it was only bad because the server was overwhelmed but he was so kind I forgave it. Plus the kids get balloons. The only downfall here is the OJ is way overpriced. It is like they are buying organic greenhouse hydroponic oranges or something! Other than that its awesome"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast in Central Scottsdale! They pump out the food sooooo fast and its sooooo good! Very good menu with tons of options!"}
{"text":"Love, love this place. We've been here several times and every time the food has been wonderful. There can be a bit if a wait but it's worth it. My husband loves the Dutch baby pancake - not many places have them and you have to allow for 30 minutes for it to cook, but it's delicious. I've had eggs and sausage: the eggs are light and fluffy and very good. The sausage is good too, and the hash browns are fresh and more like thinly sliced fried potatoes than a grated potato square you might get other places. I've also had the blueberry pancakes - so addictive and I appreciate that the blueberries are in the compote as well as inside the batter. The Buffalo chicken wrap that I tried yesterday was the best I've ever had. The wrap/tortilla was fresh and not too thick; the lettuce, tomato and cheese were all fresh, and the chicken was flavorful and seasoned just right with the hot sauce. Usually the hot sauce is poured in and drops out when you eat it, but this one had the hot sauce applied to the chicken before it was added to the wrap, which makes for a much cleaner and more welcome eating experience. Oh, and it came with house-made potato chips and ranch dipping sauce - also yum!"}
{"text":"Searching for a truly fluffy omelette in Phoenix, of the sort that can be had seemingly everywhere in Chicagoland's many pancake houses and always-open Greek diners, has been a bit of a challenge. So far, there's the Original Pancake House and Butterfield's, both located in Scottsdale, which is not surprising since Butterfield's is part of the Chicago suburban chain of the same name. This is a proper breakfast where we come from: a lofty pillow of aerated egg, in which is mixed your usual fixings, sliced potato hash browns round out the meal with toast and lashings of coffee. The same goes for the very crisp, perfectly turned out waffles. Service is attentive and polite and despite the geriatric vibe things are quite bustling and loud here. As a single diner was seated within 5-10m on a Saturday (there is no counter here) around 8:30AM. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Orange juice was to die forrrrr!!!! My husband got the Dutch baby and we shared the veggie skillet hash with 2 cinnamon rolls pancakes. Everything was very good. The eggs that came on top of the hash were nothing special. I thought that the hash browns were going to be normal sheds but they were more like potato chips. Anyway, definitely get the orange juice. It's worth the cost."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! Big portions, quick service after a long wait. Super clean, great food and very consistent. Good location, better than it;s sister location Butter's."}
{"text":"Generally I prefer local mom-n-pop restaurants, but this chain puts out some consistently good grub.
I'm a scrambled eggs guy, and nothing's more unpleasant at breakfast than rubbery, overcooked eggs, but I must admit, Butterfields has the fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever found (I can't even reproduce them at home). The potatoes are sliced like thick potato chips and browned on the flat top, and the bacon is pretty good too. I haven't tried their espresso drinks, but their coffee is smooth and strong- just the way I like it, and they'll bring out full-fat cream if you want to lighten it up. Some of their pancake options are closer to dessert than breakfast, but worth a try if you have a massive sweet tooth.
Now the downside: Don't wait until you're hungry to get a meal on the weekend, because this place is BUSY, and you could be waiting an hour to get a seat. However, even when they're that busy, the food comes out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This place is as magical as Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy... But it's better because it's real. Best breakfast I've ever had, possibly best service I've ever had too. Quick, friendly, and DELICIOUS. I can't recommend this place highly enough. Cathy was our server and she was fantastic. Butterfields is a place of whimsy and wonder. I've dreamt of the day I could return here and now that it has happened I couldn't be happier. Do yourself a favor and visit Butterfields. You will learn that you didn't know what breakfast was until now. No more IHOP or Denny's for you. You belong to the Butterfields clan now."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. The pancakes were delicious and I ordered the special egg Mexican dish which was delicious it came with fruit. Came there on a Sunday was a little bit of a wait about 20 minutes it was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"All around great place. Love when you can leave a restaurant with zero complaints. Doesn't happen too often!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving it a 4 because I will absolutely need to go back 10 more times to try everything else on the menu before I can give it 100 % !!! (And the fact that we don't have one here where we live :-(

This place was a wonderful find !!

Originally, on Saturday morning we drove over to Butterfields... saw the long wait ( 10:30 am ) and decided we wanted to get on the road too our destination more than we wanted to try this place out ... So, we headed up north & stopped @ OVER EASY off Bell st.

That was our mistake !! ... We wont be making again ... I posted my review already for there !!

So, really wanting to try this place I convinced my husband to stay in town for breakfast instead of leaving at the crack of dawn ... since it was a holiday weekend and traffic can be a nightmare ... SOOOOOOOOOOO happy we did !!! :-)

Breakfast is one of my favorite meals ... and I'm looking for fresh , delicious , quality ingredients ... whatever I decide to have ... and Butterfield's did not disappoint !!!

My husband got the Whole Hog Scrambler ... WOW !! The mushrooms ... onions ...bacon .... fresh eggs !!! Everything was just so fresh and delicious !!!

And of course me with my sweet tooth ... had to get the berry pancakes with mascarpone ....... I'm still dreaming about them !!!! :-)

Loved the fresh squeezed OJ .. and they had to go cups for taking our coffee to go for the long drive home !!! 

The waitress over charged us for the berry cakes on the bill , as she originally put in berry CREPES .. which are about 75 cents more... but I didn't even ask for her to correct it when we paid because the food was definitely worth the extra change !!! 

WE will definitely return when we are in town !!! THANKS BUTTERFIELD'S FOR A GREAT BREAKFAST !!!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably well run (always a surplus of servers with coffee pot in hand), delicious, fresh food always and great service from Angie (I always ask for her.  SPOT on), Novi, wonderful and couldn't be sweeter!, and all the rest.  So well trained and OH, I forgot to mention the place is brightly, happily decorated and impeccably clean! You won't go wrong, at least I haven't in at least 6-8 visits to either this location or the Butter's in Hayden.  It's the place I talk about all the time for their efficient service and squeaky cleanliness.  Kudos to  Chris, the manager who's always their when I am and runs a happy tight ship."}
{"text":"I had my first visit at butterfields Scottsdale. 

 I witnessed the manager berate a busboy in the front of a busy house while the poor busboy was working frantically.  

I was so shocked!!  This all happened right at the table in Front of us. 

I actually asked him why he didn't wait until the employee was in back.  He started arguing with me at the register.  
He yelled what business is it of mine  and told me to leave.  

I told him that yelling at his employee in the middle of the resteraunt and right next to my table did ruin my meal.  

He didnt care nor did he even comprehend that yelling at an employee in front of house is idiotic for any manager to do. 

  I will never be back and will let everyone  I know here in Scottsdale about the ordeal I witnessed .  

The Manager was Ted and refuse to give me his last name. 

 This guy needs an ego check and to tell a customer to leave is a horrific  way to do business.

  I own my own business and have been in a director /VP role for over 30 years and I have never witness anything like this nor have I been told to leave by a manager..

I gave it 2 stars just for the sweet waitress and the ok food.  There is too much good competition here in Scottsdale/phoenix area to put up with a nasty manager  at a resteraunt.

Edit: Upon  reading other reviews (not recommended section)  I am not the first person that the manager was rude and condescending to. The seems to be a major point with customers here.


Update 7/16/15: I sent an email  on the Chicago  corporate site soon after my review.  They have yet to contact the me.
  I guess they really don't care how the manager treats his customers. (or his employees)."}
{"text":"Butterfield's is superb! Absolutely prompt, friendly and attentive service paired with great quality food... we go there often - mostly for breakfast - and the speed with which a server appears, brings your drinks and then the food is astounding! I have never had an order prepared incorrectly, and the staff from the time you enter to the time you leave is just great!
If you have people visiting, please bring them to Butterfield's for a real first rate breakfast!"}
{"text":"While vacationing in Scottsdale, AZ had the pleasure of dining at the Butterfield Restaurant. Service was superb.  Very delightful staff.  Food was exquisite for a breakfast restaurant. I had a hash browns skillet with spicy sausage and the most fluffy pancakes ever. My wife had a three eggs omelet. Very good breakfast. Next time in Scottdale, AZ this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Honestly, Butterfields (and Butters, for that matter) is the definitive breakfast restaurant. The food is top notch and consistent, as is the service. They strive to have your food to you within seven minutes of you sitting down, and I've seldom seen them miss that window even at peak hours. 

Pricing is more than reasonable. You're looking at a dollar or two more than a place like iHop or Dennys, and the food and service are in completely different league.

Both Butterfields and Butters have arguably achieved the status of being a tourist destination. They're one of the places that absolutely everybody has heard of, and people visiting Scottsdale almost always make it point to visit. 

While I won't claim to speak to the full merits of everything that goes into making an operation of this class, I will make one statement. The owners Chris, Teddy and George all understand a concept that is lost on many. When you run an establishment of this caliber you're no longer merely in the restaurant business, you're in the hospitality business. Pay attention to any truly great business, they all share one core quality - they all make it a point to make you feel as if you have just found a second home. 

As a customer, I have felt as if I was special since the day I walked in. The trick, of course, is that they are able to create that effect for every customer that walks in the door. Judging by how packed this place always is, it's safe to say that the full extent of the experience Butterfields creates is not lost on many."}
{"text":"This place has amazing breakfast! Their waffles were incredible and the food comes super fast! Definitely best to go during the weekdays if you can, weekends tend to be a while from open to closing but worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I had the chicken salad with walnuts and bacon and avocado. It was one of the best salads I've had. When any staff member would walk by they always had a smile on their face (the men waiters more than the women.) We didn't have to wait long for our food. The restaurant looked clean."}
{"text":"I can't believe people like this place. I think the Good Egg was better. I waited at least 25 minutes, and it built up my expectations. So i was clearly disappointed when i went. How is this rated one of the top breakfast places...I guess that says a lot for scottsdale"}
{"text":"If you have more then 2 people in your party then you run out of luck getting table at this place.4 times i went with my kids and each time i was told to wait 20 minutes to get a table.First 3 times we waited 55 minutes each time.Last time after an hour of waiting i was told by idiotic hostess that i have to wait another 15 minutes.That must have been a really good joke.More then hour of waiting.Why any parents would go thru this crap.This place is not that good.I don't think their pancakes are made out of gold.I know for sure their service is bad.I thought 4 times is more then enough chances to give any business to be treated like shit."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Veggie Hash is a great vegan meal if you hold the poached eggs. It would be perfect with fresh cracked pepper and pink himalayan salt. Still haven't tried the pancakes. I'm stuck on the hash!"}
{"text":"My grandfather's favorite meal is breakfast, so I think I've been to every breakfast joint in Scottsdale.  Butterfield's is better than most, but not the best I've ever had. I do, however, wish I could give them five stars for service alone. 

Look at the menu and you'll see its very similar to The Original Pancake House, but I found the food wasn't as good.  I live in Dallas and at our Original you can taste the fresh cream, butter, high quality vegetables, and rich cheeses in every bite of your meal.  I didn't find this at Butterfield's.  It  reminds me of a cross between IHOP and The Original.  Our party ordered Blueberry Pancakes, Feta and Tomoato Scramblers and Banana Nut French Toast.  Again the best way to describe it all was good but not great.

The service however was excellent!!  When you walk in you can definitely tell that Butterfield's is a chain restaurant and that the staff is very \"on message.\"  However their demeanor doesn't come across as fake or annoying, but rather friendly and pleasant.  Often at breakfast joints you get distracted and hurried service.  Not the case here, the service was personal and efficient.  They didn't do anything in particular to \"wow\" me, I just got the impression that the restaurant operates that way every day."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great.  And wow, some of these reviewers have no idea how restaurants work and are way too picky with their food.  Food here is great, the pancakes are delicious, the eggs omelets are amazing, the stuffed strawberry french toast was really good!  Yes, I tried all these from the group I was with.  As for me, I had the waffles and some sides.  The management knows what they are doing and you know what a good sign of that is?  Check the line out the door.  You know what else that means?  The food is great.  I had a great experience with the restaurant and the service was very good considering how busy they get.  And to top it off, their fresh squeezed orange juice takes it over the top.  Only places that can compete with this place is in SD.  Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious as always, but I don't know how anyone can say the place is fast and efficient.  Any weekend any time the wait to get a table is very long.  We waited an hour today, after being told \"35-45 minutes, probably less\", with 2 hungry kids, watching, literally, everyone in the waiting area taken ahead of us, as well as several smaller parties that came in way after us taken ahead of us.  Here's a hint:  you can push 2 tables together.  There's a lot of great places to eat breakfast in town, an hour wait simply isn't worth it for a basic breakfast, albeit a very good one.  Only coming back on week days from now on."}
{"text":"Today I had a grey time love the food but I would suggest a to go box gust for a adult meal and ther food is to good"}
{"text":"Holy huge portions. Food was awesome and cooked perfectly. Service staff were all friendly and helpful. Very clean place with a cool vibe especially for a breakfast joint. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always great breakfast here. Omelets are the best. They're huge and always perfectly done. Wait staff is always friendly and attentive.  My go to breakfast place"}
{"text":"Sunday morning brunch...wait time to be expected. Little noisy but not bad. Krista, our server, was outstanding. Saw that they had New Mexico Green Chili sauce so I ordered the Hog Skillet drenched in the Green Chili Sauce. The sauce could have been a little spicier but still very flavorful. I had the Wildberry Bliss pancake as the side. It came with fresh fruit and was stuffed with a cream cheese filling that was a delightful surprise. 

Highly recommended and I'll be back."}
{"text":"My first time at Butterfields was on a weekday and they were quite busy!  I ordered a skillet that came with potatoes and pancakes.  It was way too much food.  I substituted chicken sausage for the chorizo and they up-charged me!!!  That didn't sit very well.  I'd rather pay a reasonalbe price for less food, than a high price for a portion that took 3 days to finish, with an upcharge."}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to 5 stars. Food was delicious, service was excellent, and the prices were great for the amount of food. But it's also crazy popular and lines start early. We got there at 7:30am on a Friday and were seated right away. By the time we left at 8:30, there were probably 25 people waiting.  I would say it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD. I only have pancakes or waffles or toast for breakfast and this place nailed it all. Not to mention their coffee is served with REAL cream (or at least it tasted as such). Was visiting for the weekend and the food was so great that we ate here both mornings.. this is something I've only done once before at a small trattoria in Rome. Wait was not too bad and the pancakes were perfect size. They even allowed me to customize my order a bit more than was on the menu, as I got wheat chocolate chips pancakes."}
{"text":"Had the rudest experience at butterfields recently (they also own butters). We went for brunch and were told \"move away from the reception desk,\" I countered with \"where should we stand as there's a huge crowd sitting and standing in the waiting area.\" The manager got rude, nasty and abusive saying that I should \"be quiet or I'll throw you out.\" When I complained to another manager he said we had just met the owner and although he's heard the same  complaints before there was nothing he could do. WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN! Why give your money to such a rude owner? There's too many other great places in town!"}
{"text":"Visiting from SoCal. Husband's favorite meal is breakfast. Butterfield's passed the test. He had the Mexicana, I had the California, kids had the Grilled Cheese Sandwich and the Mickey Mouse Pancakes. Not one crumb was left on anyone's plate. Service was VERY good. Can't wait to return to Arizona. Butterfield's will definitely be on the itinerary..."}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service. Their eggs benedict is the best I have had so far in the valley and they make good omelets too. Expect to wait if you come on the weekend."}
{"text":"My new breakfast spot. This place is the real deal, the food is outstanding and so is the service. Try the cheese grits."}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal! Mexicana omelet is a must if you like a little kick in your breakfast. Service was the only thing preventing this rating from 5 stars. Waitress was nice, but not top notch."}
{"text":"We continue to go back to Butterfield's over other nearby breakfast joints. Gotta love me a basic breakfast cooked perfectly the way I like it. The throngs of people waiting at all times is an indicator of the quality of food delivered. Fortunately they're all happy, friendly and in a great mood because they're going to eat breakfast! 

Upgrade to five stars because I know what to expect, a wait, diner atmosphere, competent service, dependable food, and Butterfield's always delivers."}
{"text":"Butterfields never disappoints. This is by far the best breakfast in Scottsdale. I usually get the veggie omelette. I don't know how they get their omelettes so fluffy. It's melt in your mouth goodness. The food always comes out in time and is warm. My favorite dish is the wild berry waffle. This is definitely one for sharing. I've gone other places where they serve cold eggs. The servers are very courteous, the restaurant is clean and beautiful. The only downside is that you will be waiting long if you come in on a Saturday morning. However, that's a sign of a great establishment."}
{"text":"NEVER GOING BACK... 
What do you mean no more Dutch Baby Pancake??  
We drove over 50 miles to go to one of our favorite breakfast places & as a treat we always order the Dutch Baby Pancake. 
After waiting 30 minutes for a table we brushed off by the waitress after asking to order this BUTTERFIELD'S SPECIAL... 
\"Oh we don't serve THAT anymore...\"  
We were so shocked that we thought she was kidding!!  
After going back & forth, we kept asking why & she just left & sent over the asst manager. 
He simply stated they were constantly getting burned & made a management decision to discontinue the BUTTERFIELD'S TRADITION!!!  
For Christ sake they have a half page write up in the Arizona Republic boasting about their specialized Dutch Baby Pancakes!!!  
When we stated we'd NEVER had a burnt one nor had we ever remembered having to wait any extraordinary time for the cooks to make another one... always within 15 minutes of ordering we would get it, without fanfare!!  
This Asst. Mgr was so indifferent to our complaint that one of my kids said, \"I guess we'll have to go to the Original Pancake House to get this pancake\".  
Then the Asst. Mgr piped up & shot down this comment by saying, \"Oh, but their food is terrible & I've heard, VERY UNCLEAN!!\"  
I was stunned!!  
Neither my wife or I could think of anything to say to that & the asst mgr then turned & left. 
I cannot believe a professional restaurant manager would stoop to such tactics... we've been to the Original Pancake House & LOVE their food, especially their swedish pancakes. 
The Dutch Baby is a bit better at Butterfield's but to have the audacity to speak of another competitor restaurant as being UNCLEAN, is unforgiveable... we never found this restaurant in any less than stellar cleanliness!! 
I'm sure the Original Pancake House would not be very happy to hear of this assistant manager slandering their restaurant!!  
Upon leaving we asked the hostess just when was the dutch baby pancake discontinued? 
She immediately went & got the General Manager.  
He was of little additional help, other than clarifying & contradicting his OWN Asst. Manager!! 
He said the pancake was taken off the menu just 6 days prior to us coming. When we said that we heard this was because the Dutch Baby's were getting burned & waste... we said, \"Maybe you need to get a good cook!\"  
He looked at us puzzled & said, \"They weren't burned... it just takes too long to make!!\"  
WHAT??... NEEDLESS TO SAY... I WON\"T BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first choice for breakfast. Huge menu. Quality food, fresh squeezed juice. Big restaurant, nice decor and very clean."}
{"text":"Found this outstanding restaurant on Yelp!  Great breakfast,  great service,  and atmosphere!  I tried the Banana Cream Cakes and fresh squeezed OJ.  The Cakes have graham crackers and caramel drizzled on them and the OJ was superlative. I will certainly be a repeat customer.  You will not be disappointed if you go!"}
{"text":"This is for sure one of the best breakfast spots in town! They are always slammed with customers and are at a great location in Scottsdale! There food selection is good and their food is always fresh! Their orange juice is freshly squeezed as well. If you are hungry for breakfast this is the place to go! Love it!"}
{"text":"Legit! Word to the wise weekends very busy but so is any good breakfast place in the valley on weekends. I had the California scrambler & Oreo s'mores pancakes and it was really good. They are the same company as butter's pancake cafe which I also went to and they had the same menu. You will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I craved Butterfield's all the time when I was pregnant. I've always received good service and the breakfast food is exceptional. The eggs are so fluffy, the banana bread french toast is amazing, and the fresh orange juice is to die for. I hate long wait times and huge crowds so I avoided Saturday's and Sunday's unless I went no later than 7:00am. Go during the week if you can't stand the weekend wait. They open at 6:00am."}
{"text":"Butterfield's Blows.

My hubby and I were in Scottsdale for a wedding, and this place was highly recommended to us. When we got there, there were so many people waiting outside that we were sure we were in for a treat! Oh were we wrong! First of all, the wait was twice as long as they said it would be, and when we finally went and bugged the hostess, she said they had already paged us. Rather than apologizing, she made it out to be our fault, although we'd been clutching the stupid vibrator the whole time.

It was super busy, so I was willing to overlook that, and also the fact that our waitress never even slowed down or made eye contact while serving us... IF the food had been good. But it wasn't at all. I had the worst hash browns I've ever had in my life. They were dripping in oil, but oddly had no flavor at all. How hard is it to make hash browns? The California egg scramble was passable, but nothing special either. The blueberry pancakes tasted just like Denny's or IHOPS. Fine, but so not worth the hype, long wait, and extra price tag.

Basically, the food was NO DIFFERENT than a breakfast chain like IHOP or Denny's. And you don't need to wait an hour there. I guess a bonus is that unlike Denny's, you can leave Butterfield's without smelling like cooking grease. That's about it."}
{"text":"Overall I like the location and the food.  Pricing is ok and quality /quantity is good.  I did find the management to be rude and quite cocky.  I guess when you do not have much competition you can be that way.
Major complaint is they do not have internet access.  When I asked about access, they told me this is a breakfast place not a business meeting location.  Ironically the majority of the times I have eaten at Butterfield's it has been with a business colleague.  I now drive down the road to Paradise Bakery for my business breakfasts."}
{"text":"********The noise level on Sunday, was unacceptable.**********

I defy you, to hear a single word, your table mate(s) say.
Not the place..... if you want conversation.......between bites.

YOU'LL revisit your youth on Sunday .... remember those Rock Concerts ??? 

*********My first time here on a Sunday .... and MY LAST !!! ***********

Monday thru Friday, you can hear yourself think.
Saturday, I have no idea.
Sunday, the noise ambiance is on the verge, of being pain-full.

The food was A-OK..... 4 stars
The service was also ..... 4 stars

THE ONE STAR IS FOR THE NOSIEST RESTAURANT, I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED."}
{"text":"Get here early or just be prepared to wait it out...

The line seems to be never ending at this spot, but you know that's a good thing when you're talking about a restaurant in Scottsdale where there are so many to choose from.  

Food is always great, no surprises there, otherwise there wouldn't be that line.  Regular favorites like omelets and scrambles are done as you'd expect, only probably better.  

Atmosphere is ok, as it's just a regular American restaurant.  It's like an upscale Denny's inside.  

If you're not in the mood for waiting, I would suggest heading elsewhere.  But if you're not in a rush and want some really good food, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Eating here for years now- hands down best breakfast in Arizona and anywhere else actually.  This is good food with great service.  Love this place so much.

Watch out because lineup to get in can take a long time because it is so awesome."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service! The one place that does breakfast right, from pancakes to omelettes."}
{"text":"Always great service, they have it down, food comes out fast every time and prepared right every time if not they correct it without question. Great coffee too and always with the wait for a table."}
{"text":"Nice gluten free options,  amazing orange juice,  visiting from Florida but if lived in area I would make this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SERIOUS!!! My third time back in a month. This time I took a friend of mine and we have now made a pact to go once a month. 

The food is so good that I have to try something new every time I go.  This time I had the Bacon Belgium Waffle. If you love bacon you'll love this one. It's filled with bacon and comes with a bacon on top. 

My friend had the Banana Nut Bread French Toast. We were both shocked that it was actually banana nut bread!! And some very good banana nut bread prior to it being dipped and thrown on a cook top. 

Now...my friend and I like to eat and wanted to try more than one item so we shared 2 eggs over medium with Canadian bacon and English muffin. Plain dish but still delish. I also heard the cheese grits were in point so I had a side of those. If you like your grits with lots of cheesy and not lumpy then you must try them here. I must say I've never had grits so cheesy, thick and creamy. 

As always my son had his Mickey Mouse pancakes. This time with chocolate chips and whipped cream and a side of bacon."}
{"text":"Always on a search for a good breakfast.  When I think breakfast, I think country restaurants that cater to farmers and ranchers - where the next meal might be a late dinner.  Three or four plates to hold all the food, and a 70 year old waitress that calls everybody \"honey\" or \"sweetheart\".  And hash browns that are home-made, not frozen, with a choice of different gravies. This is not one of those restaurants. 

Butterfield's, to me, is very similar to other franchised breakfast chains.  The food is better than a Denny's or IHOP, and there is a little larger selection.  In fact, the menu is massive, and I'm sure anyone could find something that would pique their interest.  But the most memorable thing about my breakfast here was the fresh squeezed orange juice, which was delicious.

It is huge restaurant and plenty of room for seating.  Both times that I was here was early on a weekday morning, so there was no line.  We have heard from others that on weekends the line is lengthy, but we never have had to wait.  And the service was great.

Other than that, the food at our table, and we had four people eating, was uninspiring and average.  We had pancakes, waffles, omelettes, a scramble, bacon, ham, sausage, almost a taste of everything. And nothing stood out.  

So I will keep looking.  I know in a metropolitan area as big as Phoenix, there has to be a country restaurant specializing in breakfasts.  And when I find it, I'll let everyone know."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Non-greasy and delicious food. Clean and inviting atmosphere. Reasonable prices. We ate here three days out of our four day vacation! The fresh orange juice and always refilled coffee are musts."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by stating that I live on the west side and this place is a good 45 min drive.  A friend of ours invited us to breakfast on a Saturday morning for her birthday so we decided to check it out.  We like to try new places, preferably closer to home, so why not. Our table ordered a variety of food with several picky eaters and everyone agreed it was one of the beast breakfast spots we have ever tried.  The omelets where so soft and fluffy I would swear they cooked them in a steam bath.  The hash browns are more like home fries and are normally very crispy.  The french toast was soft and the pancakes were fluffy.  I would actually make the drive to eat here again.  Unfortunately, the rest of the city knows about this place as well so getting their early is key."}
{"text":"5 star food and service!!  This is a picture of their outstanding cinnamon bun pancake! And they scramble their eggs to a light consistency that is out of this world."}
{"text":"Finally, after months of wanting to try this place we stopped today for breakfast and I must say it was fantastic. They have a big menu, so I had a hard time choosing. While I really wanted to try the French toast or waffles, I also didn't want all the sugar and carbs ...so I opted for the veggie omlet, which came with harsh browns and a side of pancakes. I upgraded to blueberry pancakes. I felt the portions were huge, but appropriate for the price. Mine was excellent! Dave had the apple cinnamon baked pancake...which I had to try...and it was really good. Also, our service was excellent...I was in desperate need of coffee and she kept my cup filled. I will definitely be back to try some other specialty items."}
{"text":"I told the manager that the difference between Butterfields and a breakfast place was the difference between a chef and a fry cook! Always a great meal. Always worth the wait!  Good service, great food!"}
{"text":"Very busy on a weekend morning - a good sign.  Short wait, a result of an efficient operation - this place is well run.
I ordered the Apple Cinnamon French Toast.  This was topped with their touted \"cinnamon-apple compote.\"  It was tasty, but only contained exactly 3 pieces of apple.  Not acceptable.
If you like grits made with heavy cream, you'll like their grits.  
Hash browns are made fresh, but they are overly greasy.
Portions are modest but not stingy.
Service was rather suffocating.  I don't need attention after every third bite."}
{"text":"Will may be the best server I've ever had in any restaurant, ever!!!  Always smiling and happy. He made a great meal into a wonderful experience. Thanks, Will!"}
{"text":"The food was really great. My wife ordered a chocolate chip waffle and bacon on the side, I ordered a classic waffle and bacon and eggs on the side. Waffles were super tasty. The speed of service (from first being seated, to having our food, to paying and leaving) was incredible. The wait time (approximately 30 minutes, at noon on a Sunday) prior to being seated was a mild set back, but nothing major. Overall, a great experience and great food."}
{"text":"I came here to mainly try the Dutch Baby and it was absolutely great. The service was good. The buttermilk pancake was alright but a place that serves that Dutch Baby dish gotta get 5 stars any time."}
{"text":"Not just a breakfast place.  Have had lunch there a few times and it was fantastic.  The absolute BEST prime rib french dip anywhere!  The meat is so tender it melts in your mouth.

Very friendly wait staff and fast service.  Have never had to wait for a table.  This has become one of my very favorite restaurants.   Will try breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Will was an amazing server! He was so full of energy and seemed happy to help us out. He made the experience better, I would return just to have him as a server."}
{"text":"Love this place! All of their breakfast entrees are solid across the board - you really cant wrong ordering anything. Pancakes and omelets are outstanding and equally important, they are consistent - tastes great every time and this has been our regular breakfast stop for well over a year now. Just like any quality breakfast joint, you really need to get there early to avoid the rush otherwise, be prepared to wait and while."}
{"text":"This restrant is so unique . The egg are as fluffy as a cloud . I have went here since I was a young kid . It is a kid friendly place ,and  I have one complaint they need another location ."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, but on this latest visit, I ordered an omelette. Wow! This was the lightest, fluffiest omelette I've ever tasted. Just out-of-this-world good! The breakfast potatoes served with it were okay, but not nearly as superb as the entree. I'm told their pancakes are amazing, too. You can't go wrong with this place for breakfast, brunch or lunch. But be willing to wait at least a few minutes to be seated; a lot of other people have discovered how great it is."}
{"text":"Went into butter fields today and had an outstanding skillet with a side of pancakes. They were able to take flavors, and enhance them to a whole another level. Even the hot chocolate came towered with whipped cream, and this place truly shocked me on how delicious breakfast food can be. I truly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Everything is good here from the pancakes to the omelets to the hash. I think everyone realizes how good it is too because there is always a 45 minute wait to get in on the weekend...go early and expect to wait, but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is awesome. Killer eggs benedict, fresh OJ, and their pancakes are awesome. Really fast service too. Only down side is the long wait, but hey it's expected."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed OJ...yum!

Food rating gets 3 stars, but I am giving 4 because I like the atmoshpere and staff is consistently friendly. I cannot count how many times I have eaten here. Surprisingly with all the awesome restaurants we have in Phoenix, and particularly Scottsdale, we are seriously lacking in the breakfast department. Not a lot of options for a good breakfast that isn't a big chain.

I always get the German Pancakes, \"The Dutch Baby\" (as long as I have time to wait the 20 min extra for cook time for them), they are quite delicious if you love lemon and butter as I do. Bacon is really good and consistent. Everything else to me is average. Omelet's are good, pancakes are okay...coffee is pretty good and they use cream, my pet peeve is when restaurants give you milk for your coffee instead of cream.The Hash Browns are kind of bland to me. I am always a sucker for fresh squeezed OJ.

My 4 year old eats the chocolate chip pancakes pretty good and the 16 mos old likes the silver dollar pancakes he can eat by hand.

Nothing has been as good as the old JP's Pancakes before that changed ownership, so this is the next best if you are accommodating kids and are sick of IHOP.

Beware there is usually a wait of at least 20 minutes on weekends and when snowbirds come back in the fall."}
{"text":"Very crowded and almost didn't stop.  So glad we did.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table. Ordered the eggs rojo and a Denver omelet. Both entrees were fabulous!  The food was served quickly even though the place was packed. Our server Erin was attentive, friendly, and personable.  Definitely a great choice!"}
{"text":"Grapefruit served squeezed
A very fluffy pancake
What a great ham steak
--
Quality is guaranteed here."}
{"text":"We went on a busy weekend and the service was still fast and attentive. The Dutch Baby (dutch baked pancake) is perfect, try it with just the sugar and lemon. Everything was well made."}
{"text":"A great place for breakfast. Staff is professional and friendly , and the service is efficient. We loved the baked pancakes - one is called a Dutch baby, the other is an apple pie baby. The texture is very light, it tastes like a combination of a crepe and a light omelette. Very buttery but it adds to the charm of the dish."}
{"text":"my mom and i try to find a new restaurant everytime we get togetther for breakfast, and i must say, this is so far is my favorite! first of all, i really liked the atmosphere. it was clean and simple and very open layout. we also apreciated the open window to the kitchen so you can see your food cooking and know its clean back there. 
  another great thing about this place is the speedy service! we constantly got refills on our drinks and our food came out in a matter of minutes. we were shocked:) my mom got the southwestern scramble(im pretty sure thats what it was called) it was soooooo good w/ the cilantro and corn. mmmm weve never had eggs like that before! and i got the cheese blintzes. they tasted soo fresh and home-made! i cant wait to go back and try more yummy dishes! i also appreciate the portions, you get plenty of food but its not huge like most places now. it was just the right amount! and nothings greasy or heavy, which is nice too! i'm already recommending it to everyone even though its a drive from where i live but it is totally worth it!!!*****"}
{"text":"Best grits outside the south! Haven't had creamy real cooked grits in forever. 

Great manager picked up that I didn't like the rest of what I'd ordered and insisted on getting me something else! 

Thank you for feeding us so well."}
{"text":"I am very sparing in giving five stars, but have zero hesitation for Butterfield's. Staff was warm and friendly with quick service. Relaxing atmosphere, and the food was awesome. 

Pancakes perfectly met expectations - light, fluffy and not overly greasy (unlike like some chain restaurants that taste good but feel like a gut bomb after). 

The juice caught me off guard. I was expecting something from concentrate, but no, actual fresh squeezed juice.  And the eggs - wow. All these years I've thought 'you cant screw up scrambled eggs', but truth is everyone else only screws them up. These were surprisingly perfect: light, fluffy, moist and fall apart as son as they hit your tongue. 

To top it off they let you choose either fresh fruit or hashbrowns, so I went with the fruit. 

All five stars very deserved."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  Love their Berry Bliss Pancakes!  Love their egg dishes!  We go to this location every time visit the Scottsdale Mayo Clinic on Shea!  Yeay!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast food I've ever had. Only downside is there is always a wait but I guess that's a good thing."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Butterfields, and felt it should not go unnoticed.  Too many times - people are quick to complain, however this was truly amazing.  I went there to enjoy a birthday breakfast with my family - and I can't say enough that this choice was spot on.  

I was really surprised at how busy they were - I am not a huge fan of crowds so we went at 10:30 - a time I thought would be fairly slow.  Shockingly - they were super busy and I thought \"Oh no - this will take forever!\"  I WAS SO WRONG!   

We were seated fairly quickly and the hostess was as pleasant as could be.  It was obvious that our server was taking care of several tables - and looking around it was obvious that many were repeat clients.  There was a warm rapport as she quickly acknowledged each diner.   She was gracious, efficient and friendly - I believe her name was Angela.  She took our order and was quick to refill our coffee.   

I was also surprised to see the manager on duty (I believe Chris) stop by each table to ensure all was going well.  He offered a quick pleasant hello and sincere welcome to the restaurant.   The meal itself was a very tasty treat with my basted eggs perfectly cooked!  I now can see why this restaurant was so busy - everyone from start to finish was warm and engaging - and the food delicious!  I'm adding this to one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, everything is made from scratch, slow cooked grits, orange juice squeezed to order, quality ingredients. Got the nova smoked salmon and cream cheese scramble with grits and wheat pancakes. Delicious! This may be my new favorite breakfast place in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is amazing for breakfast. I was visiting on business and decided to try it before leaving Scottsdale. Had the Mexican omelet which was delish but way too big for one. If I lived here I would come every week!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best breakfast I've had in a long time. Definitely the best breakfast place I've found in the Phoenix area. Prices were reasonable, portions were huge, the service was great, and the food was fantastic!! I can't say enough good things about it. 
The Wildberry pancakes are awesome; the fruit was fresh and juicy, and the mascarpone inside is gooey and delicious. The pancakes themselves were fluffy and soft, pretty standard.
I got the Mexicana skillet which is spicy enough to be fun but not burn your mouth off. 
The unexpected standout: the grits!!! I love grits and I've eaten them a lot. These were truly the best I've ever had. They're fluffy, warm, flavorful, and creamy in the best way. Even if you don't think you like grits... try them!!! They're not grainy like most places I've tasted. So good. 
Also, the coffee was surprisingly tasty. I hate black coffee but I didn't even use a sugar packet here!

I'm coming back to try everything else."}
{"text":"We eat here on a regular basis.  A couple of the servers know us now.  There is always a wait in the mornings, but we don't care.  The food is much better than Good Egg and iHop.  Servers are great at taking care of you.  The service is so fast.

We always do breakfast.  1 thing that wasn't so good, was the oatmeal.  Was oatmeal paste.  You could tell it had been sitting too long and no one was adding water to it.  The other would be the cinnamon raisin bread.  They used to have the thick Texas style cinnamon raisin bread.  Not sure how much the cost difference is, but now it is just regular bread.  The thicker was so much better.

Everything else I have tried has been very tasty.  I do not always have the same thing.  I like to try something different.

Place is always clean.  Watch the bussers, they are great.  They clean the tables, as well as, under the table to get it ready for the next customer(s).  Are always on the floor taking away the dishes that customers are done with.  And they sometimes have to deliver food for the server. 

Everyone here works like a team.  Managers are not just sitting in the back somewhere.  They are on the floor helping to seat people, bring out food if needed, talking with customers.  We've even had the chef bring out food because the place was packed.

I have, and would recommend this place to everyone.  This isn't a place that you over hype, it's a nice place to go for breakfast/lunch with good food and great service.  

Smile and respect the server.  They are working hard and they appreciate someone who helps make their day when it is a crazy day."}
{"text":"Nice little place with great food. The waitress I had the first time I went was a little neglectful but they were pretty busy. The next time I went the serviced was much better."}
{"text":"Another great meal with \"Will\"  as our waiter!! I don't care if you have to drive 100 miles or wait a couple of hours, ask for \" Will\" and order the  Dutch baby, you won't be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in town you must go here! I had chocolate chip and banana pancakes and hot chocolate. They were out of this world delicious! There maybe a wait and it's totally worth it. The line moves fast. My husband said his meal was great as well. He had  the California scramble. The food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. In a good way. I hate writing them a good review because the line on Sunday is already long enough. Pancakes are amazing and fluffy. The eggs always come out right. This sounds simple but it's not the case for many valley restaurants. I will say it's usually busy and loud. Maybe not a choice if you want a quiet, relaxing spot. There are stairs inside to get to elevated seating areas so it doesn't all work for walkers or wheelchairs."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, and not greasy. WARNING They charge for ALL substitutions, which is rather off-putting. I I had the whole hog skillet, it was kind of on the small side. The service overall was very good."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  My husband and I have been in Scottsdale for over 3 weeks.  During that time we have eaten breakfast at Butterfield's almost every day.  It is by far the best run restaurant we have ever been to.  The service is fast and efficient.  The waiters and waitresses are all very friendly.  The food is outstanding.  Why go anywhere else?  Tomorrow we leave for home and we will miss Butterfield's terribly.  Please open one in Bethlehem, PA!"}
{"text":"Today I'm having the Irish Benny with a side of grits and like always great service have to come back and try the pancakes"}
{"text":"Awesome place for breakfast! 5 star service and food! The food is great! Pancakes are delicious! A local spot for sure and great place to bring visitors!"}
{"text":"Butterfields is the best breakfast in Phoenix! Where else do you get fresh squeezed orange juice with the juicer in the restaurant! Other breakfast places say their OJ is fresh squeezed because the bottle says so! It's NOT fresh squeezed! Only at Butterfields do you get great food and fresh squeezed orange juice. Butterfields is the best!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining here one morning during a recent trip to AZ. I could see why it was so popular, wonderful food at a great value. I tried the Veggie Skillet and asked the waitress if perhaps the cook could minimize the green pepper (not a big fan) and when I was served this lovely meal, there was a small bowl of perfectly cooked green peppers on the side. Everything we had was delicious. The Corned Beef Hash my sister ordered was homemade and NOT from a can, making me completely jealous that I hadn't ordered it as well. My son demolished the Silver Dollar pancakes he ordered, which never usually happens. 
We truly had an enjoyable meal and met the owner Chris, who was warm and hospitable. To me, the mark of great service is not only delivering what is promised, but surpassing expectations. Butterfields does this, along with with friendly and efficient service. Will definitely return whenever we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Never dissipated by the service or food here. Thank you Will for the outstanding service today."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened.  Food portions used to be humongous so it was worth the cost and the long waits.   But, today, the portions were noticeably smaller to my husband and kids!!  What was worse is how cold the food came out.  The pancakes, the eggs, the bacon.  Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Laid-back place, we did get there at 10:30am on a Wednesday, so not sure how busy it can get.

 I had the Mexican egg burrito. This thing is full of beauty and wonder. YUM! 

Nothing is like sitting with your family, having breakfast at a restaurant, and seeing the cooks behind the counter checking out the female patrons sitting. I MEAN REALLY??!  I'm a dude and understand it all, but come on man! This experience has ruined my experience at Butterfields. I'm giving it two stars because the burrito was really good, however, doubt I'll be back again because of what I saw. I don't even know what more to say."}
{"text":"love love LOVE this place! 

i went to the location in Illinois a couple years ago and came across the one here! was so excited to go bc i remember how delicious it was then and it definitely didn't disappoint this time either! 

FRESH SQUEEZED OJ! yummy!! have tried a few things on the menu that have been pretty average, but by far the best thing on the menu is the WILDBERRY CAKES! yummy, so delicious! their vanilla cream is apparently made in house and the entire concoction is absolutely divine! i'd go back just for those! also out of the lunch menu, i loved the southwest veggie wrap, it was also delicious, very flavorful, kept going back for more bites! oh and of course, you can never skip out on the latte if you go for breakfast!

they're very busy so every time i've gone, there's been a wait but not too bad. service is good, some busy days are a bit slow but nothing horribly bad."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the Phoenix metro area, IMHO. There was a small line at 9 a.m, but if your entire party arrives at once, you'll be seated sooner vs later. It was only a 5-10 min wait this morning. 

The menu says it take ~30 min for the pancakes, but it's quicker than that. I had the protein pancakes, which were hearty and delicious. 

But you must get the spinach and gruyere crepes! No exception.  Those are so good, you'll dream about them until the next time you can get them again. 

For a place with high turn out, it's very clean."}
{"text":"Don't you love those lazy morning that spill over into lazy afternoons, when you don't leave the house 'til around 11am, and your body still wants breakfast even though it's lunch time?

After catching a movie the wife and I flipped through my \"to try\" bookmarks and decided to give Butterfield's a spin. We had no idea we had another SOLID breakfast spot close to our side of town!

Even though it is a pancake house (such a delicious mortgage), we ordered the Mexicana omelette with jalape√±o jack cheese, and the Corned Beef Hash Skillet. The food came out FAST even though they were real busy, and being real hungry, we were real grateful. The Corned Beef Hash Skillet was real tasty... Had it been my order I would have asked for it to be extra well done, but my wife was more than happy with all the hash browns, green peppers, onions and ample amounts of hash and eggs. The omelette was stuffed with chorizo and fresh avocado, and was moist, fluffy and just spicy enough. On the side came a short stack of a couple pancakes, and after taking one bite I instantly regretted ordering an omelette (after all, it's not an omelette house, is it?). The pancakes were real cake-y, with crisp outsides, and next visit I'm definitely ordering a full stack of their specialty. I'm gonna be fat, and I'm gonna be happy, and I'm gonna be fat and happy!

I don't know why I overlooked this place for so long... There are really only a couple of decent breakfast spots in the North of the valley, and I think maybe I just discounted it as not being anything special. I also initially thought it was a chain like Baker's Square or something, but looking online I only see 4 locations throughout the US. Seriously, Butterfield's offers quick friendly service, SOLID food, and a big bang for your buck."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food, great service, reasonable prices. The banana nut french toast is my favorite thing in the menu. This place isnt for everyone though. If you LOVE finding stuff to complain about online, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Wow! The food was great and so was the service!   We arrived Saturday morning at 8:30, and it was predictably crowded, yet we were in and out so quickly. The server was friendly and helpful. 

My wife ordered French toast. It was tender, fluffy, and light.

I got salmon scrambled eggs. They were delicious. Perfectly balanced flavors. 

The bacon was smokey and good. Hard to beat,  infact."}
{"text":"Tasty food, packed fun place.  The service was perfect. Food presentation was very good, especially the pancakes!  Will be coming back, thank you!"}
{"text":"The Butterfields waffle Sunday made my jaw drop when I saw it. Pretty sure it was love at first sight.
So,  I've tried a few different items here, and have not been disappointed by anything. The OJ is good too. This is one the my preferred breakfast joints in Scottsdale, it's cozy, I usually get seated right away, and the service is friendly.  
Tip- I like the cheese blintzes"}
{"text":"Very good pancakes. A little to many people and therfore a lot of noise. But all over a good experience."}
{"text":"Everything is fresh including their potatoes ! Best breakfast ever ....We came back several  times during our stay. 15n to 30 mn wait time on the week end, not a problem at all."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good breakfast place.  I try to go during the week because the weekends are so crowded and noisy.  They have great coffee (and real cream, which you never find)."}
{"text":"Delicious. My favorite breakfast place of all-time. I would give it 5 stars except that I cannot stand screaming children or sketchy behind-the-scenes staff. I know that children in the equation is not the restaurant's fault (I blame the parents who think it's ok to bring small children to a public place then not supervise them), but it adds to the overall rating of my experience so I'm being honest. The staff is another story.... Surly and skulking in the corner are not cool when legit custies are trying to enjoy their meal.
 
My favorite menu items are here:
Veggie hash and Nova Lox platter
http://butterfieldsrestaurant.com/menu/arizona-breakfast.asp?show=specialties

Hopefully my next visit will be better. I can still taste my last one though, and it was delicious. :o9"}
{"text":"Great food, open early, super kid-friendly. Eggs rojo were good (not great) and I'd like more Mexican options (like chilaquiles) but the pancakes/french toast were a big hit."}
{"text":"I have never had breakfast this exceptional! ! The service is fast and professional. I recommend everything on the menu,  you just can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Butterfields was recommended to us as we made our first visit to the area and it didn't disappoint. 
  
  While the restaurant was at least half full, and it is quite large, we were visited promptly by our attendant who was very accommodating to our needs

 I ordered the veggie scramble and instead of a pancake asked for the blissful French toast, came as a half order and an up charge but it was SO worth it. The veggie scramble seemed to have more than 2 eggs, plenty of veggies, the potatoes were ok. They weren't flavored in the least and not all of them were like the \"hash\" being crispy. The French toast was amazing. Super nice and fluffy brioche bread with a decadent but not over powering mascarpone sauce and lightly warmed fruit.
 Hubby ordered the corned beef hash and again a very large serving PLUS the corned beef is made in house and was super flavorful with plenty plated. 

  Finally we also ordered lunch to go: the French dip which was not particularly flavorful, and the chicken Cobb which was plentiful with bacon but not so much the chicken which was also not seasoned. 

Breakfast A+ Lunch C Service A"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Butterfields often. I love the veggie hash! It is always awesome. The servers are always friendly and prompt. 
However, on this last visit, we were very annoyed at the other servers and managers. It seemed to be the time in the shift when the manager had cut down to just a couple of servers. We were sat and waited about 5 minutes to be greeted. We were fine with that, as we are both in the restaurant industry and could see that our server received several tables at once. It took a while to get out coffee and our order placed, but again we were fine with that since she was clearly busy. However, we could hear other tables getting upset at the lack of service, though they were to blind to realize their server was busy. My annoyance came about when I noticed the manager, 2 servers and 3 hostesses standing up front screwing around instead of helping the busy server. Would it be too much to ask to help your fellow employees by getting refills, running food, or doing anything to help? Apparently the manager is only there to chat with the hostesses half of his age. 
Aside from this, the food is always delicious and I would recommend this breakfast joint to anyone. I would also recommend some training on how to help your coworkers!"}
{"text":"My friend Ashley took me here for b-fast in the heat of the AZ summer on 6/6/10.

The place was like a good blind date.

I went expecting the worst with a contingency plan for everything and instead was left not wanting it to end!

This is a small family chain from chicago.  I think so many people from Chi town come to AZ that someone went home one time after being in AZ and told the owner to open one in AZ to service all the Bulls & Bears snowbirds!

I'm glad they did.

Look it's not high end french cuisine, but it's damn good family style food."}
{"text":"Their coffee and syrup were the highlight of my visit. The coffee is so good, and the creamer doesn't taste store-bought. They make their own syrup too!

I had the eggs with hash brown potatoes and sausage patties. I was not a fan of their eggs as it had a milky texture. The hash browns were like pan-fried potatoes, which is not what I imagine when I think of hash browns. The sausage patties were standard, and the pancakes were delicious! I've been wanting to go back here just for the coffee."}
{"text":"A must check out breakfast venue. I am unsure about weekends but we were here on a Tuesday morning, fairly crowded. We were seated immediatly upon entering. We ordered drinks and within seconds the server was at our table taking our breakfast order. Within 10 minutes everything was on our table. Hot and cooked to Order. Very clean establishment. Friendly service and food was cooked perfectly. Bottomless coffee. Will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Great place! Usually you'll have 15-20 minutes to kill, but it's worth the wait. Everything is delicious. Everyone is smiling. I love eating there. 

The strawberry Belgian waffle and apple pancake are both ridiculously awesome. The skillets are tasty too. We were there again today and Willie was our server - nicest guy ever."}
{"text":"This place rules.  I have eaten twice while visiting family in Snottsdale, and was blown away by the quality here.  I am surprised that I am the first reviewer.  Picture Original Pancake House (from whom many of the menu items ie Apple Pancake, German Pancake, etc were borrowed) but with higher quality ingredients, fresh squeezed juice, and killer coffee.  The kicker is they serve the coffee with heavy cream rather than half and half.  In the land of strip malls that is Scottsdale this place is a stand out.  Haven't tried the original outposts in Chicago's Western Suburbs but if I am ever forced to go back to Naperville I definitely will."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday brunch because I had read some good reviews so I thought it would be good.  Man was I wrong. The food to forever to get there the wait staff ignored us the whole time.  The food was cold the pancakes where stale and hard. The coffee was even bad. The worst part is when we complained they didn't even ask if we wanted the food remade or seemed to even care about the quality of the food.  Don't waist your time with this place."}
{"text":"Our 'go to' breakfast place.  Best coffee, best breakfast.  Constant service.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Just as good as we remember! We had to have brunch here while we were in town visiting for the weekend. Butterfield's is one of the fond memories we have of when we lived in AZ. We were pleasantly surprised to see an updated restaurant - they modernized it quite a bit and took down some dividers so it really brightens up the place. Not sure when they did this remodel as we haven't been back since we moved out of AZ three years ago...but it looks great. It's as busy as ever but we were smart and arrived at about 8:15am. We only had to wait about 10 minutes. If you arrive after 9am, be prepared to wait. We walked out about 9:30am and the crowd outside was growing by the minute. However, they have a large waiting area inside and out so that helps. Their food is just as good as we remember...we HAD to get a bacon waffle or it wouldn't have been the same. They are still on point with their coffee game - pouring us our first cups almost immediately after sitting down and never letting it get past half empty. My little one loved his pancakes and happily sat in his high chair nom nom noming away at them. Delicious! Thanks for still being around Butterfields...we look forward to more brunches whenever we visit AZ!"}
{"text":"Came here twice and both times we were seated quickly and the food arrive within 5 mins of ordering. The fresh squeezed oj was good the first time but the second time it tasted a little weird but I'll blame it on bad batch of oranges other than that the food was delicious"}
{"text":"At first I doubted my server, made me wait a bit. Girl who brought my food wouldn't get me tea. But as I was eating I started to feel sick. My server noticed I didn't eat and was concerned. She offered to take it back. It wasn't her fault, told her not needed.  I am happy of her awareness. I recently was at a very nice restaurant and my friend didn't like her food and the server could care less. Kudos to mine for caring!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing in every way possible. A busy Saturday morning with only a 10 minute wait! The food was top notch and far better than I expected. The staff was more than friendly and welcoming. We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I love you Butterfields, but I think I could love you more if you made the hostess stand a beverage bar while I wait. It would be awesome!"}
{"text":"Went for Breakfast the first time today. Had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated but a reasonable wait for the amount of people they had waiting. Once seated our waitress greeted us promptly had coffee and water within a couple of minutes. They have a very wide selection to choose from and it all sounds great. Our meal took a little while to come out but it was worth the wait. Everything was delicious and if I'm back in Scottsdale I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Awesome pancakes!!! Disappointed they didn't have shredded type hash browns, but what they have is still very good, regardless. 
Everyone in our group was very happy with what they ordered!! ***** 5 stars all the way... food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Really great for breakfast. Super yummy pancakes and good coffee. There is a wait sometimes but wait has never been more than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning, prior to a doctor's appointment. While I was assured that everything I ate was gluten-free, it definitely wasn't (tummy troubles began 10 minutes into my meal... I was hoping it was just indigestion, but symptoms turned they way they do when I've been \"glutened\"). 

They have gluten free waffles and pancakes on the regular menu, so I went in with high hopes. I asked about the hash browns and sausage links and were told they were GF. I ordered the GF pancakes (which come as a side to the two egg breakfast). The pancakes had a very strange aftertaste (almost like there was cheap, not-cooked-out, too much vanilla extract... it was strangely alcoholic) and I wasn't convinced of the texture (VERY spongey). The hash browns were meh, plus I think they were the culprit. They tasted frozen (there's a certain texture that fresh hash browns have, and frozen hash browns are always suspect as most frozen potato products are coated in flour to prevent sticking together). While the ingredient list may not have listed gluten, would someone have noticed if it just said flour, especially if it didn't say wheat? I just don't know. 

They were also out of any caffeinated black tea. For breakfast. At a breakfast joint. I ended up with a passable green tea, but it wasn't fabulous.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"My family loves Butterfield's!!!  If you're coming on a Saturday or Sunday morning, expect a wait, but once your order is in, the food comes out super fast.  Usually, I'll call in an order for pickup, and they tell me that the food will be ready in 5 to 10 minutes.  Sure enough, I get there 5 minutes later, and the bag is waiting behind the register for me ready to go!

Everything that I've ordered has been great.  I'm not claiming that it's the best breakfast restaurant in all the land, but it's definitely far above average with consistent quality with fast service.

If you like chorizo, consider the New Mexico Skillet, or if you're looking for something more delicate, try the Spinach and Gruyere Crepes.  When given the choice between Pancakes and toast as a side, don't be weird... get the pancakes. ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service all around. The portions were huge! The grapefruit juice we had was freshed squeezed. 
I highly recommend the cheese grits. They use cheddar and a touch of heavy cream...ah, heaven in a bowl! 
The wait was 45 minutes, but well worth the wait. Our server Will was very gracious and attentive. 
All in all, a very nice dining experience.
Best not to go on Mother's Day for obvious reasons, but if you're looking for a great brunch, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I can't think of anything negative to say about Butterfield's- they have everything down perfectly. The breakfast is awesome and there are a ton of choices. I have gotten many different things and you really can't go wrong. Plus, the service is great!

 It gets super busy in the mornings, any day of the week. There is a lot of seating and there always seems to be a wait, but they are pretty good about getting people through without feeling rushed. 

It's a great place to meet casually over breakfast. Try the orange juice, it's fresh squeezed and full of awesome."}
{"text":"First of all, the place was cranking at 10am on a Sunday, so you know that's good. We had a party of 13 so knew we would wait, but they said around 45 minutes and had us follow the wait on the No Wait app. Actually only ended up being 30 mins and worth the wait. 

The cinnamon roll pancakes were the bomb, chocolate chip waffle, Mexican omelette, banana creme pancakes all delicious. What a great find!!"}
{"text":"We ate at Butterfield's Pancake House for the first time this morning after seeing the restaurant listed in the Arizona Republic's List of Top 15 Phoenix Breakfast Restaurants. We were impressed and will definitely be back. I loved the Swedish pancakes, my favorite, and my husband was a big fan of the bacon and great freshly made hash browns. Our server, Angela, was awesome and personable, and we loved her. After reading the Yelp review from August 10, 2017 before posting mine, which alleges that an owner screamed obscenities at customers who had spilled a drink, I can only hope that the hard-working staff works so quickly because they are motivated by good management vs working in fear."}
{"text":"Food was good. Place was pleasant. Best part is the omelets and frenchtost.



Will go again"}
{"text":"The baked apple pancake took me back to being a kid. Amazing as good as I remember"}
{"text":"By far our favorite breakfast in the Valley. Of so many great places Butterfields has the best food, and best service. Every experience delivers the same consistent excellence!"}
{"text":"This place is very clean and neatly decorated. They have gluten free pancakes available, of more than one kind! That was a nice surprise because I miss ordering pancakes for breakfast. Service was a bit slow, but the place was busy at 1030 on a weekday and I wasn't in a hurry, so it wasn't a big deal. I would recommend this place if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, it is my favorite breakfast place. The service was awesome and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Can I just give 5 plus stars!!!!! Food is incredible & staff is friendly & quick. I am never disappointed here, I come twice a week, favorite.... Mexican omelette, fluffy w chorizo, avocado & cheese!!!! Seriously this is a must if you want a delicious filling breakfast."}
{"text":"had the california scrambler.  great food...lots of it!  the only thing was when i first walked in i asked if they had seating outside.  it was empty and clearly had a cool to go outside.  the hostess said no outside seating...just a waiting area.  what?!  after breakfast, we sat outside for quite awhile and it was full of people just waiting.  not sure why the establishment wouldn't take advantage of outside seating in AZ for additional business and customer satisfaction.  the wait time was 20 min. on a sunday morning at 9 a.m. and was right on time for seating."}
{"text":"My husband, my son and his fianc√©e go up there once or twice a year. I wish it was closer as we have moved to Maricopa (really bad move). Still, I will continue to go there and hopefully we'll be back living in the East Valley in a few years.

Their food is incredible. I love Butterfield's!"}
{"text":"We love the food here - every time we've gone here our breakfast has been delicious.  Pancakes especially....and the fresh squeezed orange juice.  Unfortunately we stopped going here some time ago since the wait is so ridiculously long."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite breakfast restaurants.   Whenever we are in the Phoenix area we make it a point to visit here at least once.   Not only do they have great food but the service is superb."}
{"text":"This is probably among my top favorite place for breakfast in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  The service was excellent and friendly.  Thought there would be a long wait time but on a Sunday at 10am for 4 people there was about a 10 to 20min wait which wasn't that bad.  

I got the California Scramble and it was delicious.  It came with hash brown potatoes and pancakes."}
{"text":"From what I can recall, I happened to enjoy our meal @ this joint. Though (if this is a reason to complain) it took me nearly 15 minutes to decide what I want to order...The menu is HUGE, I mean there must be 200 items and 1000's of combinations of those Items... This, in my opinion means that they can't focus on a few REALLY outstanding items. I can barely remember our service experience, which for me means it was forgettable. But the food was price OK for the area (north Scottsdale), and overall I would return, but with a big group this time as the pace is a little loud."}
{"text":"This is the only place where I will wait the 30-45 minutes to get seated.  The protein pancakes are so good and the omlets are cooked perfectly. They also have good coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice."}
{"text":"Awesome - love breakfast and this place is great. Love their Apple Pancake, but usually I order omelettes or just regular pancakes. They're omelettes are very fluffy and generous, and come with great sides. Pancakes are super fluffy too. I also really like the atmosphere, it's just a very homey, breakfast place - comfortable, not over done but not a hole in the wall either. It's always packed, so expect a wait for a table."}
{"text":"Visited my family in AZ this past weekend and we were looking for good breakfast spot. We found this place based on reviews and boy did it not disappoint.

Came on a Sunday during brunch hours and yes there was a crowd and yes we had to wait. Our party of 8 waited about 20 minutes before being seated but it was well worth it. 

They have an orange juicer right in the middle of the restaurant and it definitely made it tempting to try the juice. My one year old nephew had some juice and it was great to see him enjoying something without extra added sugar.

I ordered the Irish Eggs Benedict and it was hands down one of the best breakfast dishes I have EVER had!! Yummy corned beef hash with onions and the hollandaise sauce was on point. Best of all my yolk was runny in the middle just as they should be. Everyone at my table ordered different items and everyone seemed satisfied by the end of the meal. My five year old nephew finished his whole plate of chocolate chip pancakes!

I guess I am lucky in the sense that I didn't have to interact with the manager during my visit and our server was sweet and attentive. Will definitely return next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome breakfast!!!  Took about 10 mins to be seated but understandable, a lot of people waiting to be seated.  The place was packed but service was fast. Everyone that works here is very friendly and has very positive happy vibes. The staff was young and efficient.  I will definitely be back when I come to Scottsdale.  I loved this place!  Also the coffee is great!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Butterfield's since it opened a few years back. It has quickly become a family favorite, and I always order the same thing - it's hard to stray from sheer perfection! I build my own omelette consisting of ham, cheddar cheese, and mushrooms with hashbrowns on the side and a big ol' glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. This is the best omelette I've had in Phoenix/Scottsdale besides the Ritz Carlton - and let me tell you, I have had MANY ham and cheese omelettes :) 

However, I find it odd that they call themselves a pancake house. My family and I do not like their pancakes, nor have any friends that I have brought to this breakfast spot. They are crumbly and lack the buttermilk flavor that I look for in a perfect pancake. 

Overall, the omelette is SO good that I can easily forego the pancakes. The service has always been great and the food is delicious - this will continue to be a family favorite!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast there this morning , we had pancakes which were fluffy and tastety. Omelettes were very tasty with green chilli. Bacon and eggs were cooked just right..we will be heading there once again tomorrow."}
{"text":"So so good! Packed house today being a holiday, but only had to wait 20-25 minutes. The food was delish! Had the country Benedict and the berry french toast. I wish the berry French toast cake with some hash browns, but the dish was so good!"}
{"text":"Great food and service and everything is made fresh daily! Seriously fresh OJ and I love the coffee with cream and vanilla syrup :-)"}
{"text":"Menu has changed. My favorite item has been scrapped. MINUS STAR! But I tried their protein pancakes recently which I think they are knocking off of US Egg, and they were pretty damn good. Better than I remember their plain pancakes being. I still don't understand why orange juice is $5+ a glass. The coffee is still great but expensive as hell too so I drink my coffee before I go."}
{"text":"This I s a great  place to eat.Everone is so friendly and  food is good.Service  can't be any better.
MB"}
{"text":"BF brought me here for Birthday breakies. Yummy. Crepes were very tasty. 
I object to paying more for maple syrup vs crap table syrup so did not get waffles or pancakes, although they looked good. 
Service was prompt- the bussers were totally on it and pleasant. 
Great bacon that they were willing to so crispy (yum!) so I was a happy birthday girl. :)"}
{"text":"Good golly this place is delicious.
Yup, it's so good it made me say 'good golly.'  :-)

This is easily one of my favorite brunch spots in Scottsdale.

The wild berry pancakes are outrageously good.
As is the orange juice.
As are the scrambles.
YUM.  I want to go back right now.

Plus, service was very good.  Our waitress was friendly and quick.

The only thing I think could be improved is to add a system to \"call ahead\" to put your name on the wait list.  When you're hungry, it's frustrating to drive here and then wait 30 minutes like we did.

Honestly though, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oh Butterfield's how glad I am to have found you after my tried and true breakfast joint just packed and left me. 

The service is amazing, the food is super yummy and breakfast has never tasted better.  With so many choices and tons of space, there is never a long wait and the food is always high quality and top notch.  I'm pretty sure I'm in love."}
{"text":"From a recommendation of a friend, we tried Butterfield's Pancake House.  We arrived  with high expectations and weren't disappointed.  There was a bit a wait but is worth while if you have the time.   The Wildberry Bliss Cr√™pe for $ 8.95 satisfied my craving!  This french crepe stuffed with wildberry mascarpone, topped with vanilla cream, fresh wildberries & glaze is sweet and rich.  No low cal here!  The only mishap was after I informed my server that I have a nut allergy,  specifically ordered a dish that did not contain nuts and after being reassured by the server that  I could indulge in this dish, my crepes arrived with a couple of pecans on the side of my crepe.  \"They must have fallen off another dish while in the kitchen\", was my only reply.  Good thing my girlfriend and I saw it for I would have had to deal with an allergic reaction from this  slip up!!!

I forgot to mention that my Nancy M. enjoyed their gluten free pancakes."}
{"text":"I love butterfield's and my family and I go there every sunday to go eat breakfast. But the only problem is the girls that work up in the front are a little ignorant to people and for it being so early in the morning not a lot of people really want to deal with that. One time my mom asked the girl if she could borrow a pen the girl looked at her said she didn't have one yet they had a whole bunch of pens in a holder....gee..what great service. The waiters are great!!! they always are on top of their game and of course since we are regulars they love to talk to us. We have told them about the girls but I think this is a perfect way to put them on blast! If you are working at a place that considers great customer service (obviously everywhere) then fake a smile and put that nasty attitude away. Being rude is not good customer service. Other than that go to Butter Fields! they have the best food of course :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Butterfield's!!!  First local place to have Gluten Free pancakes over 5 years ago!!

Locally owned & operated, and the owners KNOW how to run a restaurant.  Always great, fast & efficient service AND all with good prices.  

They still have sliced hash browns (NOT gross skillet/diced potatoes).  Their skillets are soooo good!!!

They also have REAL maple syrup not artificial funk.  The best bacon too!!!  Great huge scrambles - the Popeye is awesome!

My whole family loves this place!  

There is normally a wait on weekends before 12:30, but they are efficient & fast -- normally only 10 - 25 minutes depending on size of group."}
{"text":"This was a great little spot. We stopped by this morning for a quick bite to eat. Apparently things were recently renovated inside and I appreciated the decor and set up. It was busy -- always a good sign!

The food came out quickly and our server was very friendly and attentive. We got an order of buttermilk pancakes and french toast, both were great and generous servings. We got an additional side of bacon and biscuits and gravy. I'm personally not a fan of sausage gravy so I didn't love that as much. 

Overall, things were fine and I left with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Good service, fast and very friendly. 
The protein pancakes were wonderful and the bacon crispy and perfect. 
Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Mmmmm....so yummy.  It's a breakfast place a few steps above The Good Egg.  When we walked up we saw lots of families and small groups waiting around for a table, which always worries me because I hate waiting.  Much to my delight the wait was only 15 minutes.  Our server was great, he was attentive and funny and made the experience quite enjoyable.  

I ordered their challah French toast (I cannot bring myself to call it \"holly bread\"...I'm sorry, I can't.  It just ain't right.) which was good but was missing a particular flavor that I couldn't put my finger on.  However being 2500 miles from the nearest NY diner I will take what I can get!  The home fries were very good, the perfect crunchiness and not too greasy.  It seemed as if most of the dishes came with a ton of options, for example my husband's (huge) \"scrambler\" also came with a side of pancakes.  My parents, my husband and I ate enough food to keep us full for the entire day!  The menu is pretty extensive and I'm interested in trying some of the other options, so I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS FREAKING AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! (No other elaboration is required. Get in your car and get down there!!)"}
{"text":"Oh my god! five stars only because of their waffles with bananas ice cream and caramel! to die for! I came here for vacation and i would go back to arizona for these waffles! I love the idea of breakfast and dessert. This restaurant was packed when we went. It was around 11-12 noon ish on a Sunday. The wait for 5 was about 30 minutes. Its funny though because i was standing right by the hostess stand and they kept telling everyone who came in the wait was 15 minutes. They told us that thats why we stayed to wait. It worked though we waited. If she had told us 30 mintues we probably would have left because we were hungry. If was pretty obvious though that the wait would be long the waiting room was packed (which is pretty big to begin with) and the outside was packed too. They also have good OJ. They make it themselves."}
{"text":"I have been to Butterfield's several times when visiting Scottsdale, and I can't think of anywhere else in the U.S. where I would rather have breakfast.  The service and food are consistently excellent.  

I usually order the same thing because it contains everything I want.  I get the California Scramble, made with EggBeaters.  This contains bacon, avocado, cheese, tomato, and order of perfectly-browned hash browns, and two pancakes.  Yummy!  

Also, I always have the iced tea.  It is perfect!  Come to find out, they use filtered water and they brew a batch about every fifteen minutes (the teamaster overheard me and my boyfriend discussing the tea and filled us in on the details.)  Ask for a to-go cup when you're ready to leave.  

Service is polite and quick.  No complaints here.

If you like breakfast, Butterfield's is a must-try when you're in Scottsdale.  They also have lunch/brunch menu, but I have never tried anything on it.  No need to when I have the perfect breakfast every time!"}
{"text":"Awesome!! This places rocks. My favorite breakfast I've had in a long long time. Service was incredible - got seated quickly, waitress right there to take our order quickly, and food came out amazingly fast given that it was a full house. I got a really tasty blueberry waffle, with scrambled eggs. Others got omelette and pancakes which were really tasty and fluffy.  Good coffee and fresh OJ to top it off.  It was a bit expensive ($42 for 3 people) but a nice treat out for breakfast. I wish they had these in CA."}
{"text":"Delicious! Your waistline will not thank you for coming here, but every other part of you will be ecstatic about the glorious, fattening fair. Pancakes are fluffy, the hash browns crispy, the sausages delicious, etc. I vote you go full force and get the Wildberry Bliss pancakes or French Toast, either stuffed with blueberries, layered with mascarpone cream (I would eat this on cardboard) and berry glaze with a side of berries. Go early on the weekends as it can be a wait."}
{"text":"Just had my first perfect experience. Starting with a text book greeting, prompt service, exciting menu options, helpful server with prompt and genuine concern, quality of food served was perfect. Wow, will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy cats. Never in my life have I had pancakes like these... I was on vacation in the Phoenix area and my friend and I didn't discover this place until towards the end of my trip but we made sure to fit in a second visit on my last day because we loved it so much (we went to Butters Cafe the 2nd time, same quality!). First I want to say our waiter was amazing, I wish I remembered his name because he was incredibly friendly and helpful. The first trip I ordered an omelete with home fries and a side of the cinnamon roll pancakes and a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice. Oh my.. The omelete was amazing but it was huge and so fluffy, once I tasted the pancakes I was too distracted and ended up taking 3/4 of the omelete home (it was still great when I reheated it later). I can't even describe these pancakes.. You know how they say no matter how much you exaggerate the Grand Canyon it still won't be enough? Well that's how I feel about these pancakes. They are unlike any pancake I've ever tried.. They are so fluffy and basically melt in your mouth and the icing/cinnamon drizzle are incredible. The second time we went I skipped the omelete just because of how big it was I didn't want to take up any space, I was there for more pancakes. The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious as well. I'm so bummed this restaurant is not here in Pittsburgh although it's probably good it's not because I would eat here several times a week. This will definitely be one of my first stops the next time I'm in AZ!"}
{"text":"Great Midwestern type breakfast dinner!  Fluffy pancakes and delicious fresh squeezed OJ!  They recently remodeled and the place looks great."}
{"text":"If you can get in...which is a huge pain given all the retirees who line up here at crack of dawn..I'd recommend it.  They have a great variety of breakfast options and I got the french toast which was delicious.  Service was very good as well. It is just too hard to get in and when you are hungry waiting 30 minutes not good.  If you don't mind the wait, I'd check it out."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had breakfast at Butterfield's for the first time. The food was delicious especially the pancakes and bacon!  Service was good too. I drank lots of coffee because that was surprisingly delicious. Definitely would recommend this restaurant for breakfast.  I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"Saturday morning woke up and family was craving good breakfast.  Being a little rough around the edges from a few too many cocktails Friday night decided to play it safe and go out for breakfast rather than cooking.  My youngest daughter wanted Butterfields (as she pronounces it BetterFelds but she's 3 so give her a break) so we headed over.

Got there about 9:30am and packed outside but didn't feel like going somewhere else.  They turn the tables really fast so only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Everything was delicious (as usual).  Definitely get a fresh squeezed OJ and try the pancakes.  If you are up for the 20-30 minute wait on the weekends  the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Great food, I ordered the corned beef skillet so 5 stars for that and their pancakes are where it's at! Coffee is among the best I've had and locally sourced, so +1 for local. The only critique I have is for the service and timeliness of our order. I think the service could have been more attentive, friendly and faster, in the servers defense, we were a party of 9. Overall experience was great, a solid 4 star."}
{"text":"Well it started off good...until the \"hostess\" skipped us for a seat.  She gave us a pager and told us it would be 5 to 10 minutes for a seat. Close to 20 minutes went by so I walked up to ask what the deal was, she looked clearly confused. She told me someone else had come up with the same pager number...how is that possible? She apologized, but cmon, seating people isn't rocket science....or is it? Apparently she wrote the wrong pager number next to my name....I spoke to the manager about it and he seemed to somewhat care half heartedly, But also implied \"I maybe had set my pager down somewhere and two dudes picked it up and took our place in line\"....first of all, how did I still have a pager when I walked up to the hostess stand? Secondly, I don't know who would set a pager down somewhere and forget about it if they're seriously waiting for a table! I had my Grandmother with me, wanted to take her to a nice Christmas Eve breakfast...the pager never left my hands! Me setting my pager down somewhere makes no sense and he's bogus for believing the hostess who fed him that lie...I guess 3 girls working the hostess stand isn't enough...Maybe they need 5 girls up there to make sure the job gets done properly...? I ordered the French toast, my grandmother had the eggs and bacon. We enjoyed our food. long story short, the food was good, our waitress was good, but the service left something to be desired..."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today all I can say is great, we have The Original Pancake House in California and the dutch baby was better here. I will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Everything went pretty well here this morning. We beat the rush of people who were waiting outside just after 9:30am and were seated quickly in a mostly full restaurant midweek. My vegetarian skillet dish was nicely put together with good hash browns under a nice fluffy two egg scramble. This was only $8.99 and was served with a choice of two pancakes or toast. The famous pancakes were good, but not fluffy, if you like them that way. Good, solid meal and you can't go wrong with most things you order or the very friendly service."}
{"text":"If you can get past the wait time (which can be long especially on the weekends) and the loudness, the food is fantastic!! Best pancakes, omlettes and potatoes! Baked potato omelet is my favorite! Recommended when people come to visit, I've never heard a complaint about the food!"}
{"text":"I frequent Butterfields often but this is first post. I walk every morning. My wife slept in on Mother's Day and met me there at 7:30. We split an omelette with side of pancakes. Omelette was perfect. Pancakes were even better. They were very busy but food came out quick and hot. Service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. One of my favorites for breakfast. It always seems to be busy and it's no surprise why. It's a noisy restaurant, but not annoyingly. It's just the sound of the kitchen working and people talking. There's definitely this busy diner vibe. Staff is always friendly and attentive, great customer service. 

The food is always amazing. I try corned beef hash everywhere and they have one of the best. Really can't beat corned beef hash mixed with runny egg (I get mine poached) and some hot sauce. For my side of pancakes I always upgrade to banana cream. So creamyyy. I've had other skillet and benedict dishes and other pancakes and none of them have disappointed. Nothing fancy on your plate. They keep it simple and they just make it really good."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  First time for the fam.  Was a bit of a wait but once seated food was fast & delicious!!!   We enjoyed watching the fresh oj making machine :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It was our first time and the manager visited our table and explained how most ingredients are locally sourced and how the food is made from scratch. He brought me a sample of their grits and black beans. The grits were fantastic and had the consistency and sweetness of tapioca pudding. Of course I need a nap from all of the carbs I just ingested, but the attention to detail makes their food stand out and will be added to our list of breakfast spots."}
{"text":"I love this place! My go to breakfast order is usually the wild berry crepes because it is AMAZING! But I've tried their chorizo omelette, their Banana Nut Cream French Toast, and the Sundae Banana Belgian Waffle and all I would have again without hesitation because they're all delicious!"}
{"text":"The girls here are flirts, have no sense of boundaries, and unapologetic. One of the employees who was not our waitress came by the table and complimented my boyfriend's tattoo and bent down to look at it. I told her I didn't appreciate her talking to him and all she said \"sorry I just like tattoos\" with a snotty attitude. Of course word travels fast and girls love to gossip. Eventually another girl who was not our waitress decided it was okay to also compliment his tattoo. Bet you girls wouldn't appreciate it if a girl did that your guy in front of you."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place! Their dutch pancakes... Its a baked pancake that should have its own honorary holiday. Their grits are incredibly creamy and addictive. The Cajun chicken sausage is well seasoned and cooked just right. Their pancakes are fluffy yet filling. Whoever makes the eggs, bravo! Over easy eggs are perfect. The scrambles and omelettes aren't over cooked. There is always a perfect filling to egg ration, you are able to enjoy every ingredient. 
The staff is always so kind and the waitresses I have had so far are both complete gems. Everyone I have shared this restaurant with have become fans. I haven't had a bad meal or experience here. I honestly don't think I ever will..."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant to Butters and every bit as good. The problem is that it's so good, the wait is usually a minimum of thirty minutes so don't be in a rush. This is a no fluff straight forward breakfast, but they do it right. 

I love the eggs Benedict and just a straight up eggs, bacon and potato combo. Fresh OJ is a must. They are best known for pancakes and waffles but I don't like sweets, so I can't comment. My kids love them though."}
{"text":"This place is Ahhhh.Maaaay.Zinnnng! We showed up around 9:45 and the wait was 20 minutes. If I could ever give anyone advice, it would be WAIT! This place is one of the best breakfast joints in the US! Will is an amazing waiter and his suggestions were on point."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about Butterfield's on Shea! While the food is beyond delicious and always delivered hot and fresh to your table (we go every weekend for a nice, leisurely breakfast), I write this review to acknowledge ESTHER - the amazing hostess and air traffic controller who essentially runs the front of the house. Esther is never flustered, despite the incredible pace at which this restaurant serves its frequently packed location. She is flashing hand signals to bus staff, flips her iPad around on her wrist to see which table is open next, and is in complete control of the dining room with that ever-present smile on her face. Walking into what seems like absolute chaos on the weekends for breakfast, Esther marks a very reassuring presence that you will be seated efficiently, greeted, and sent out the door with a warm goodbye. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Service was great and quick. Food was really good. Had the strawberries and cream waffle. Wife had the Mexican breakfast burrito. Great experience. Affordable as well."}
{"text":"The. Grits. Are. Spectacular. 

Full-fat and spectacular. 

Everything we ordered was good, but seriously, you must try the grits. We both had the regular grits -- I guess you can add cheese, but they're pretty perfect without them. And I say that as a real cheese lover. 

Friendly service, yummy food, and my coffee cup was constantly being topped off. Great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Love love love Butterfields.  From the orange juice to the omelettes to the pancakes & waffles to the panini sandwiches.  Awesome.  Our family loves Butterfields!!  Get there before 9 on the weekends though!!  ;)"}
{"text":"Had the eggs benedict and cheese grits. 

Both were good, but nothing out of the ordinary... 

I particularly liked that they had donut holes from Dunkin Donuts along with coffee in the waiting area....

While we didnt have to wait long, I definitely filled up on SEVERAL of the cinnamon, powdered sugar donut holes."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh squeezed orange juice, gluten free pancake & waffle options, friendly staff, clean, and a good option for a breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was packed on a Thursday morning at 10:30 am.  It was a short 10 min wait but I can't imagine how busy it probably gets on the weekends!
I have a chorizo skillet  that I am still dreaming about!  It was finely chopped chorizo full of flavor and topped with a fried egg over easy to perfection!  Coffee was very good and the sever kept coming with refills and to check on us if we needed anything. Would definitely return but hesitant to endure a long wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Wish we'd experienced this place sooner. Great atmosphere with an open dining plan. Had the veggie skillet with a shared banana French Toast. Excellent food; fresh, nothing overcooked or drowning in cheese or oil. Excellent portion sizes, wonderful, complementary sides, great emphasis on balanced ingredients."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food
-1 for the server: Our server was quite rude and short with us from the very first encounter. I don't know if it was because it was the holiday, but it just made our dining experience =/ 

I came on Monday (observation of New Years) and there was a 45 minute wait for our party of 6. There was quite the crowd outside of the restaurant, but the wait wasn't as long as I expected. The wait was well worth the food!

I can make a pretty damn good banana nut bread so I was quite skeptical of ordering the Banana bread french toast, but decided to get it looking at all the reviews about it. OMG it was by far the star of all the dishes we tried at our table. The banana bread was so moist and tasty. It comes with fresh slices of banana and pecans. It wasn't very sweet and it didn't need any syrups because the natural flavors were outstanding. SO GOOOD! 

Wildberry Crepes were also delicious. There was a perfect balance of tastes and textures from the mascarpone creme, berries and the crepe itself. Also, very light. It was very yumm.

If you are looking for savory breakfast, the New Mexico Skillet was great. Nice blend of chorizo sausage, onion, green peppers and avocado and hash browns and cheese w/ choice of eggs on top. The hash browns are fresh, crispy and very tastyyy."}
{"text":"Just another pancake house nothing spectacular about it. Quick service I must say and nice staff"}
{"text":"SO YUMMY!  I came in expecting an IHOP like experience, but with big, plentiful breakfast and lunch entr√©es of great quality, Butterfield's sure did impress me.

I had a two egg breakfast with bacon (yay they have my turkey bacon here). With my egg breakfast, two pancakes and a bowl of fruit too. That's a lot of food! It was all sooo good. The eggs were fluffy and perfectly cooked, bacon was nice and crispy but not burnt, super fresh fruit (melons, berries, and grapes), and of course their pancakes were delightful. I love me some good pancakes and Butterfield's pancakes are definitely top notch. They are on the smaller side but so sweet and fluffy. Add some butter and syrup, and MWAH! Perfection. I also tried a bite of my Dad's Denver omelette and it too was great.

We visited during the late morning on a weekday and it was packed. The short wait was definitely worth it. Service was friendly and attentive. Our food was made and delivered pretty fast. Prices were very fair. My meal was around $9 and the total for our table of three was less than $30. 

I wish we had Butterfield's in California. I would be visiting every week if it was! Definitely worth a visit if you're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow what an experience....made up my own omelette, and  upgrade my pancakes to their signature one, for $.99 more, and it was so worth it.....i will diffidently  go back there again...the wait was not long at all, .. I always notice this restaurant, when I went to the Harkins  Shea, and now I understand why there is always a long line to get in and eat...."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Pancakes...(mike drop). Need I really say more?"}
{"text":"Wow! Very clean and bright decor lends well to morning meals. EXCELLENT service - attentive, offered coffees to go at the end. Very interesting menu - classics and some interesting twists. Top notch food taste, quality, portions. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! Their food is absolutely delicious. This will be a must stop whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Had the spinach and gruyere crepes.. Out of this world!!  Best breakfast I have had in forever!!"}
{"text":"Two words:  Bacon.  Waffle.

That's all you need to know, honestly.  Just do it.  Right freaking now.  

Unless it's after 3pm, in which case you are SOL.  But all the true breakfast places are only open in the am, or 24 hours in my opinion, so that's a good sign..."}
{"text":"I didn't have room to eat everything on the menu that other Yelpers have enjoyed, or even everything that sounded good to me. But I will definitely be back because that fresh-squeezed orange juice is the best ever, and the banana nut bread French toast is not to be missed. My companion dove into the coffee, and she's hard to please. Nice staff, and the location right by the movie theater is so convenient."}
{"text":"There is a reason why you will probably have to wait for a table.  The place is very good!  The service was prompt, and unlike some others we never felt rushed.  Our order was delivered accurately (5 of us), and all at the same time.  Absolutely no complaints.  I don't usually give 5 stars, but Butterfields is close."}
{"text":"It's rated the #1 breakfast spot on Foursquare for a reason! The food was amazing. The Dutch baby pancake was unreal and they had so many great gluten free pancake options as well. The manager and waitstaff were very nice and even gave us a sample of the wildberry bliss crepes."}
{"text":"We have been going to Butterfield's since they opened.  We feel the changes that have been made may be somewhat healthier, but what the heck!  If we are going for breakfast, I want the things I don't have or make at home.  They have gotten rid of the wonderful crisp hash browns and replaced them with what I would call sliced potatoes that were somewhat cooked but definitely not crispy.  The Mickey Mouse pancake for the kids has lost the small fruit  that used to accompany that.  My granddaughter noticed it immediately, so we purchased a small bowl of strawberries.  I feel even the pancake batter has changed.  Coffee is still good.  We are on the prowl to find something that is as good as Butterfield's used to be.  This disappoints us greatly that they changed.  Coffee is still great!"}
{"text":"Overall not a bad breakfast place.  There's a few things that really stand out to me

First is the fresh squeezed orange juice.  It's hard to find fresh OJ around the valley.  Second is the look and feel of the place.  Very clean and open.

Ordered the salmon scrambler which is almost like an omelette but not quite.  Eggs came out just a tad over cooked, but the hash browns cooked perfectly and the pancakes nice and fluffy.

One thing I asked our waitress if they add any butter to the eggs, as I noticed almost like a buttery sheen on my plate.  (Trying to eat a little healthier). To my surprise there is a 1/2 ounce of butter added.  Now I know yummy taste always comes with a price but that has a way of adding calories really quick.

Will try the place again but only if they can hold the excess butter."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a huge variety of options for breakfast. The first time I had the baked potato omelette with buttermilk pancakes and it was very good. This time I ordered the protein pancakes and they were the best ones I've had in town. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice that you can watch them make and a cappuccino bar, which are big pluses. Be prepared to wait if you go on Saturday or Sunday, but it's worth it. The place is also loud so it's no ideal for meetings - at least on the weekends."}
{"text":"The place is very nice, the food is GREAT but they are a little pricey...."}
{"text":"Great food, great server, great atmosphere, and fast! We got pancakes, grits, omelet, and the southern benedict. Everything was great! Specially the pancakes - light and fluffy! Sam was our server and she was kind and directed us on what to get."}
{"text":"Alas, I hate to put an end to the string of five-star reviews for this establishment, but I had a rather mediocre first experience at the much-ballyhooed Butterfield's this morning.  

I'll start off with the good points.  I really liked the spinach scramble I ordered (I opted for the egg white sub), and the cheese grits I sampled were light and tasty.  The coffee was decent, although not up to that of, say, Breakfast Club (I believe they serve Illy) or even the private-label stuff at Wildflower.  (NB: The heavy cream served with the coffee was unnecessary.  Being a part-year Canadian, I think the best cream for coffee--if used at all--is the 18% mf coffee cream widely available in the Great North.  More flavorful than half-and-half, but not quite as sludgy as heavy cream.)

Now for the bad points that made it a two-star breakfast for me.  First, the pancakes: I paid extra for two multigrain cakes instead of the buttermilk and was horrified when I bit into one.  It seemed undercooked in that it was soggy and tasted of raw flour.  Undeterred by the setback, I had my BFF dining companion give me one of her buttermilk pancakes.  Better, but still none of the slightly crunchy bite that epitomizes that golden \"crust\" of a perfect pancake.  Being a throwaway starch side to the meal, I would have let the gross pancakes slide, but for God's sake, this place bills itself as a \"pancake house.\"

(Incidentally, if you're thinking there's no such thing as a tasty multigrain pancake, try the protein cakes U.S. Egg serves up.  The PCC Men's Grill will also whip up delicious ones to order.)

Second strike: Butterfield's \"maple syrup.\"  I've had plenty of maple syrup of all grades (interestingly, the cheaper/lower the quality of maple syrup, the stronger the maple flavor), and the stuff they put in their private-label bottles is the oddest-tasting maple syrup I've ever sampled.  If, however, you are a fan of ersatz syrups like Mrs. Butterworth's, by all means, stock up: customers can buy Butterfield's syrup to take home.

I end my review on a lighter note: those of you who know me also are familiar with my occasional lapses into East Coast snobbery when I ridicule the Midwest. (Four years in Chicago for college: I think I paid my dues.)  My friend Kerry, a proud Michiganian, always sticks up for her regional plot during these times.  Sitting at this restaurant, which apparently hails from the Chicagoland area, she mumbled, \"I hate to say this . . . I *really* hate to say this . . . but this place is so Midwestern.  Ugh.\"  Hearing this pejorative remark brightened me up and almost made up for the subpar pancakes.  Almost."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the food is delicious! They also have a cool design on the interior of the restaurant. I wish I would have found out about this place sooner. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Butterfield's because the average good comments here, but it was a horrible experience.
Waitress was friendly but forget the milk for our coffee. My hubby ordered the  Mexicana Omelet and I the wildberry bliss crepe. Both were NOT fresh made.     The omelet was dry and hard. The mascarpone inside the crepe was... horrible. Overall, both dishes were not warm enough.
I do NOT recommend this place. In our eyes, only good for people who just want to eat... for eating.
The upcoming days, we will return to Butters Pancake Cafe."}
{"text":"A group of us needed to find a last minute place to get breakfast and we randomly chose Butterfield's based on convenient location. We made a pretty good choice. The service was fast, efficient, friendly. The menu was extensive and well priced. One day, when I've given up on life, I plan to go back and order the oreo cookie pancakes.  They look amazing. They also look like they'll probably kill me."}
{"text":"The reviews are SPOT ON! This place is AWESOME! Excellent food, excellent customer service, kid friendly. I highly recommend coming here. We will be back for sure when we visit Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Best omelette I can find anywhere. Great crispy potatoes. Fantastic pancakes. Good coffee. Service is quick. I have been here many times and it has been my favorite breakfast place for some time. Very busy all the time, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to Sunday morning breakfast stops. We hand always had great service and great food. 

Though the wait is a bit extreme. Even closer to noon, it is still at the 45 min mark. 

I really like the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting breakfast! 
First time, and it was so  tasty. 
I ordered the gluten-free pancake with eggs and a black coffee.
My husband ordered the skillet with pancakes. 
We didn't converse during our breakfast, so that's how you know it was delicious! 
The place was packed, but we were in and out in 45 minutes. 
Restrooms were clean and service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast! Came on a Sunday morning when they were busy, but it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had my daughter and family visiting and had to bring them for breakfast! Once again Butterfields was wonderful! Everyone enjoyed the breakfasts they ordered. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast. It's easy to screw up. Even easier to make it a boring, forgettable meal.

If The Good Egg is the Coldplay of breakfast joints (see that review), Butterfield's is Reign in Blood era Slayer. 100% awesome.

The food is really good (example: California Scramble). The staff is attentive and mostly not annoying. The wait on weekends gets a little long, but who cares? You'll be glad you stuck around."}
{"text":"Excellent from beginning to end. Service 5 stars, Food 10 stars. Chicken Ceaser was amazing. Everything looked so good that it took awhile to decide what to order. Everyone in our party was pleased with their meals and we couldn't help but share plaWill definitely be back to try more of the menu options. Next time breakfast for sure."}
{"text":"its really no surprise that this place has GREAT buttermilk pancakes.

gonna makes this quick: came here for brunch with a friend and we shared the salmon & california scrambler.  both were pretty decent.  i liked the california scrambler better tho, it had more kick to it.

i was expecting a long line/wait for a saturday morning brunch, we were seated rather quickly.

i'll tell u this, it sure beats ihop or dennys."}
{"text":"All I have to say is WOW!!!! Our server was Sydney. She was super attentive, told us about the new menu items, an made some great recommendations! It was so nice to have a server who actually cared about her guests experience! We ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, and theminced ham an egg. Every thing was delicious!!! Me and my girlfriend are definetly making this out new breakfast spot!!!!"}
{"text":"They serve the most fantastic breakfasts. We had the strawberry crepes and omelette. 

The only problem was the service. I can appreciate that it's a super busy restaurant but service is still a huge part of dining out. Our issue was that we could not get coffee when we were first seated nor could we get anyone including the manager to get our ticket and pick up the credit card off the table for almost 15 minutes.

I will give it to them that the food was served hot.  I suppose that's enough for some."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast person but, sometime I'm craving breakfast food for lunch. This place is my favor breakfast place. Lucky Butterfield's is only a block away from my salon. Best Eggs Benedict I ever had, also their Crepes spinach, mushrooms & cheese with sos Bearnaise are awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time because of the reviews and also I was starving after my Drs  appointment; which was literally across the street. I'm not much of a pancake person for breakfast but love eggs Benedict. I ordered the classic benny and it was fabulous. Coffee was amazing, and the service excellent!! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"We discovered this place about a year ago or so. Very nice atmosphere with plenty of seating, but always packed ...even during the week. The first 3 times it was unbelievably good in every way 5 stars, except the typical hour plus wait(even during the week)sucked, but at that point- totally worth it. The app for seating makes it easier to know when it's time to be seated. 

The service was great, we had the same waitress who had reddish hair and she was lively and humorous. The coffee at that point, was the best coffee in any restaurant or coffee shop, I had ever had!  It was rich, strong, and very flavorful and they kept it coming. There were add'l servers who kept the coffee going for everyone. Being caffeine sensitive, I was about to jump out of my skin and still asked for a refill to go. It was soooo good. I asked one of the owners to put in a drive thru, just for the coffee.  If you are a coffee snob, you get it right? 
The food was excellent! I got the blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon and added OJ the 3 rd visit. After I heard the OJ was fresh squeezed, well you just have to get it, perfect OJ! 
The pancakes were hot, fresh, fluffy, large portion and yummy. Blueberries were also delish and packed in the cakes. The bacon was a smoky applewood, thick and chewy.  
My husband got the New Mexico Skillet (has Chorizo), it was also very good and I don't usually prefer that type of breakfast but I might have even ordered it as some point.  My husband got that skillet almost every time, the portion was a tad on the small side, especially considering portions on other items.  It has the option to come with plain pancakes, which were very tasty but could use added real vanilla extract. 
The 3rd time I ordered a California Scrambler no cheese, and it was massive! I ate about a third.  The omelet tasted like it was coated in real butter, way too much butter for me. I thought the scrambler was going to be a healthier choice, but I don't think it could have been.  Good to know. 
The last two times we went were late last summer, and were huge disappointments! The blueberry pancakes tasted cheaper like from a cheap mix and more chewy. The blueberries were noticeably less.  The bacon was overdone crispy. The coffee, it broke our hearts, was watered down and tasted very different. I didn't ask for even one refill.  We asked a server what happened and they seemed to avoid the question. It was a very ...very, sad day. The service was no longer on point, we had different servers though. We thought it must be a weird fluke. We gave it one more try. My husband got the plain pancakes, they were bland and tasted like cheap mix again. I tried the french toast, it was cool, super eggy and chewy.  Coffee was still watered down and different. Service was not as good either. We thought we had found the perfect breakfast place, and it slipped away. Ugh please bring the amazing coffee back and the food and service. We would go back if they reverted to their former amazing selves. 
We might give it a shot again since recent reviews seem better.  

FYI Butters is the same menu & same owners. But that restaurant's stuff slipped at that point too. Although way less of a wait and smaller restaurant. So heart breaking. Maybe the restaurants were going through a trying to cut costs phase."}
{"text":"I heard big things about Butterfield's, and the huge crowd and wait seemed to give credibility to the hype.  We waited about 20 minutes on a Monday morning, which is pretty long for a weekday.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict, which is my breakfast staple. I was disappointed as soon as my food arrived. The hollandaise didn't pass my visual test... too light in color, too runny looking. I took a bite and knew my instincts were correct. It had a \"grainy\" texture and was just ok. Hollandaise is the key to a good Benedict.  Anyone can serve an English muffin, Canadian bacon and poached eggs. Hollandaise is what requires a little magic. My hash browns were also a touch undercooked for my liking.

It was \"A-OK,\" but nothing more than that. 3 stars."}
{"text":"This place serves a good breakfast for a reasonable price with decent service. I think the egg dishes and pancakes are better than most breakfast places though I should add that this is not the best place ever. It is in the neighborhood (by extended Scottsdale standards) so when we go out for a regular breakfast we try here first. It is very popular so you can't count on getting in easily. Sometimes you can't even get to the door. Still, a good choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best OJ in town! Butterfield's has a great menu with plenty of great options from pancakes to omelettes and everything in between. Love the California scramble with hash browns  The cinnamon pancakes are a must if you have a sweet tooth! Come here for a hearty and fulfilling breakfast accompanied by awesome service and warming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow, what a busy place. We came here while visiting Scottsdale. We are always up for a good breakfast and it seemed that this was the appropriate restaurant to try. 

This place reminded us a bit of a great small pancake house in Anaheim, CA called the Original Pancake House. It is much bigger and modern, so it lacks charm, but the food is better than standard faire. With that said, the creativity is good in their menu selection, but poorly executed. I had the banana french toast and was a bit disappointed. The banana bread used was fine, but too dense for french toast. It hardly had any egg coating to truly classify it as french toast. 

They serve huge slices of raisin toast, but bigger is not necessarily better. Very dry and not flavorful. 

Eggs were fine, and the service was good. I would come here before going to IHOP, but I would seek a different small hole in the wall breakfast joint before rushing back here. Avoid the Sunday brunch hour patrons, unless you're prepared to wait an hour or so. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Met my girlfriend here for brunch last Sunday and loved it!

Huge menu selection, fresh ingredients, generous portions, and good service.  I had the whole wheat french toast and it was taaaasty.  I ate the whole huge plateful :o)  

The wait was long, but not unexpectedly so--especially for a Sunday.  Will definitely return to Butterfields--there were sooo many other things on the menu I'd like to try!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places in Scottsdale, AZ. They have a huge selection of breakfast items from egg Benedict, to scrambles, to many different pancake options! My personal favorite is the cinnamon swirl pancakes! They are insanely good! The staff are all super nice, friendly, and fast! Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is dependable. I mean, I'm just telling it like it is.

I've been here a handful of time. We always try and go early as otherwise you can get comfy on one of those benches and wait. And who wants to do that on an empty stomach.
That said, the wait its does tend to move on the quicker side.

I LOVE LOVE the Eggs Benedict here. They make their own Hollandaise sauce. The Florentine Benedict is a good option.

The service is always on par. We are not talking overly friendly 'let me be your best friend' type service. But they get the job done. And really I don't think my coffee cup has ever been close to half empty here. So all in all, it works.

The options for kids are great. Love those Mickey Mouse pancakes.

Everyone we always go to breakfast with here has great things to say as well.
I will say I feel satisfied after breakfast here. But not to the point where I want to throw it all up because I stuffed myself silly.

It's a winner."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I loved it, skillet with egg whites, bacon chicken, jack cheese, grits,raisen toast. The meal was wonderful. The service was great. It was a bit too noisy for me but since it was a holiday weekend that makes sense."}
{"text":"basically the same place as Butters. same menu, same quality. food is good but over-priced then have to pay extra for everything.
still a good option if you don't mind the cost and usually a 20-30 min wait."}
{"text":"This place is hopping on Sundays.  It's a big place that can seat a lot of people and there were a lot of people waiting to be seated.  We came at 9 a.m. and the wait time was only 10 minutes so that wasn't bad.  For breakfast I had the Popeye Scramble (egg whites) with hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The scramble took up 1/2 the plate and crispy hashbrowns took up the other half.  Who's complainin'?  I'm not!  The restaurant was nice & clean and the service was really good even with how busy they were.  The only drawback was the place was a little too noisy for me.  I mean it's Sunday, you have families coming to eat, you have to expect it I guess.  Would like to venture back and try the banana creme french toast."}
{"text":"I keep telling my husband I'm going to wake up early on a weekend and take him up here to have breakfast.  I haven't brought him yet, but I keep finding reasons to take myself up here.  I first ate at a Butterfield's years ago in the Chicago area, and love that we have one here.  I just wish we had one a little closer to home.  Get rid of a skeezy Denny's or something here in Chandler and put a Butterfield's in instead.  

The bacon is the best.  Thick, slightly smoky.  Just the best.  And I love that they get the hash browns, which I call home fries, nice and golden brown on the outside.  Just perfect to mix up all that egg yolky goodness with.  Like I said in my last review, I know they serve lots of great items here, but I will always come back just for the basic bacon, eggs, and taters because they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in around 11am on a Sunday morning and encountered around 30 people standing outside waiting. Fearing the worst, I inquired about a table for 2. Ten minutes later we were seated. I ordered the huevos rancheros and they were nothing short of spectacular. My wife had an avocado omelet which she loved. For only $26 bucks, it was a steal. Will definitely return in our next visit to scottsdale."}
{"text":"George and Ted Syregelas have quite the growing breakfast empire going in the Scottsdale area.  Between their flagship breakfast and lunch restaurant Butterfield's and their breakfast only concept Butters Cafe, they've got the Scottsdale breakfast crowd wrapped around their little fingers.  Granted it's pretty hard in the grand scheme of things to screw up breakfast compared to most meals of the day (though I've found a few in the past).  But like Butters, Butterfield's brings two characteristics that always earn a big thumbs up from me.  Quality and consistency.  Most of Butterfield's offerings are standard, while some push the envelope ever so slightly.  But even if the breakfast doesn't have a lot of pizzaz, I'll gladly come back for a good old fashioned meal done well.  Early morning on a Saturday, I had a hankering for a special kind of pancake.

You can find Butterfield's Scottsdale location on the north side Shea and 74th Street (just east of Scottsdale Road).  The location is quite large with seating for I'd guess upwards of 125 or so at max capacity.  One thing you'll catch right behind the hostess up front is the fresh squeezed orange juice being made constantly for all to see.  Its a good first impression to make to the diners and likely the reason their OJ is so wildly popular.  The menu (like Butters) boasts a pretty wide array of items including pancakes (obviously), omelettes, skillets, french toasts, benedicts, waffles, you know the drill.

Despite a fairly large dinner the night before I was surprisingly super hungry.  Good thing because there were a couple of full sized items that had my attention.  I love pancakes and since that's what they're famous for, I felt it obligatory to get one of those.  But it was actually one of their benedicts that I wanted most.  Actually it was more of a southern dish than anything.  The Country Benny reads (mostly) like your traditional biscuits and gravy.  This one with poached eggs and sausage on a biscuit with white gravy.  Plus a side of potatoes because, well, one must.  The pancake I was interested in wasn't a stack, oh no no.  I just wanted a single pancake.  A single baked pancake that is.  Whaaaaaat, you ask?  We're talking one of their Baby Apple baked pancakes.  Essentially a fluffy cast iron skillet pancake.  Admittedly I had no idea how big one of these was (more on that later), but I figured it must be fairly filling if they're only selling one at a time.  And of course a large glass of their fresh made OJ to wash it all down.  Total cost for everything including tax and tip came to about $35.

The OJ is as good as advertised.  Fresh, not a huge amount of pulp, but delicious without being overly tart.  The baked pancakes take about 30 minutes to make here, so I got my benedict first.  Great portion with plenty of that rich gravy to boot.  There's just something luscious about mixing poached egg yolk with gravy (or maybe that just me).  Biscuit was warm, flaky, and fluffy, and had nice big hunks of sausage.  Shortly after I finished the benedict dish, the pancake arrived.  And this thing is a monstrosity!  Took up dam near the whole plate and was quite literally the size of a cake.  Had to be at least an inch thick and 8 inches diameter.  Self doubt immediately crept in as I was sure I wasn't that hungry.  One bite in though, and I knew I was pushing through that wall no matter what.  A soft fluffy cinnamon pancake doused with candied apples and powdered sugar.  Throw a little butter in the middle and you've got yourself a breakfast dessert for the ages.  For most, this alone would fill up one person for breakfast.  My advice?  Grab another breakfast dish, then share one of these baked pancakes with your companion for dessert (and yes, dessert for breakfast is allowed).

The majority of their dishes are $10 or less so most of you can get a good meal for cheap without going crazy like I did.  But wow that baked pancake was worth the insanity.  Next time I'll probably give their Dutch Baby baked pancake a try.  I also like the fact this place is open early on the weekends, which is good because I'm an early riser and like to beat the weekend brunch crowd.  The Syregelas brothers know what they're doing and the crowds (and the stellar Yelp reviews) at both their Butterfield's and Butters restaurants are all the proof required.  Breakfast done right, or in this case breakfast done better than it has to be."}
{"text":"This is mine and my husband's favorite breakfast spot!! We have not been disappointed once in the 10+ times that we have been here. 

The staff is friendly, the atmosphere is great and the food is just amazing. 

Definitely recommend and we will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"I've lived here for over a decade, and have been to practically all of the breakfast places in town. This is hands down the best service, quality and atmosphere you'll find! Sunday mornings are busy, but their seating turnaround is swift, and you'll find it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I had the new Orleans French toast with side of Bacon.  I must admit I went here because I saw all the reviews for this place. I was so excited thinking it was going be this great breakfast.. Well I must say its few step above denny's .. They do serve you  fresh orange juice which is very pricey.... . I wanted the Vermont maple syrup but they charge 1.50 for that'...... they were wrong for that. So got my check total cost was $16.40.. very expesive for breakfast for 1 person."}
{"text":"Lots of food. Had a great Denver omelette. Pancakes were generous as were the other portions. I would return here for lunch or breakfast."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Came here for brunch. There was a long line. So you put your name on the list and they will call you when your table is ready. 

We looked over the menu on yelp so we don't waste anymore time thinking of what to get. 

We ordered a cappuccino, vanilla latte iced, & a caramel macchiato iced. The cappuccino was hot, tasted like nothing in it just espresso. The vanilla latte was okay, tasted alittle sweet. The caramel macchiato tasted sweet ( more then the vanilla). 

For food we got the cheese blitz which was okay. 
My brother got the New Mexico skillet, it was good alittle spicy. It comes with hash browns & with toast or pancakes (we got both) & your choice of eggs, we got scrambled eggs. The pancakes were so good, taste like homemade! 
I got the omelette I made my own with bacon, sausage, tomatoes, green pepper, avocado, spinach, cheddar & extra cheddar. It's .25 per item. It comes with hash browns or grits & toast or pancakes. I got hash browns & toast. The omelette was so soft & cheesy! It was delicious! My brother loved his food. I loved my omelette!

 The place is nice inside and big, they also have a patio to sit outside.

Great place to come and good prices!"}
{"text":"I LOVE breakfast, and its places like this that is the reason why. Good service, great food, good atmosphere. There was a wait when we got there but it was pretty quick because we were only a party of two. I ordered the eggs benedict (shocker I know) and my friend ordered their whole wheat pancakes. Everything is delicious and really affordable and the portions are large. We were stuffed and only spent like $15 a piece. My friend swears by their fresh squeezed OJ. They also have a small lunch menu if you aren't in the mood for breakfast. The only problem with this place is how far it is from where I live. I'd definitely make the drive for a darn good breakfast though."}
{"text":"Efficient friendly service and good fresh-squeezed juice. I rarely eat breakfast food but I enjoyed their New Mexico skillet."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the service is great. It's nice to find a place with an awesome breakfast. The pancakes are fluffy and tasty. The corned beef hash is freshly made and tastes awesome. The only thing I would add is flavored liquid non-dairy creamer for the coffee. Get there early (before 8:30am) because it does get busy (because it is very good), otherwise you'll have to wait."}
{"text":"All time favorite breakfast joint! I have a love for detail, the lights in the front entrance are waffles and in the main seating there are flying pancakes on the ceiling. On top of it being adorable, the food is awesome!!! Chocolate pancakes are the absolute best and I've tried my fair share of chocolate chip pancakes! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is really good.   It has that sorta feel like trendy, family, and hot food which is always nice.  Its been professionally remodeled.  Family that operates is really good too.  Chances are you will run into the owners as they are always there.   Fast friendly and good.   These guys have many years of experience and believe its a 2nd or 3rd generation family business.   I would get an egg dish for sure"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Butterfields.  Today we had the Popeye scramble.  Me with fruit and wheat cakes.  Him with white toast and homemade hash browns.  The eggs are always fluffy.  The bacon is high quality.  All this for $9.25 plus tax and tip.  Great food with the following small tip - bring in your own coffee as their coffee sucks."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Loved the staff. The thing that brought me over the top is that I believe good etiquette and morals of the staff says as much about a place as it's food. I left my wallet there and someone immediately turned it in to the manager. I got it back the next day. Thank you so much to that kind individual!!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Coffee was great. Food was delicious. And the service was on point! We came in on Easter Sunday so there was a bit of a wait, which we expected, but we didn't have to wait the time we were told."}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious! Came to have breakfast for the hubby's birthday celebration. The service was great! Servers always very attentive. By far one of the greatest places I have ever been to for breakfast. Definitely beats IHOP. Even though it was pretty full we did not have to wait long for our food! Definitely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Delicious, crowded, noisy are three words to describe this popular pancake, crepe and  omelette eatery.

Most of the seating is open, so at peak times you will experience the same sound level as an outdoor road with traffic!  The food is delicious and the staff does their best to accommodate the flood of people and screaming babies on weekend mornings.

Wear ear plugs and enjoy!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Butterfield's Scottsdale Restaurant Saturday Oct 1st at 1PM. Our party included my 90 year old Mother on a walker, as well my sister, her husband and their 17 year old son. My nephew ordered a Panini which was very small, my sister ordered some crepes which she felt were not very good, my brother in law and I ordered a Denver Omelette which I was going to split with my Mother. When everything came my omelette was not fluffy and generous like my brother in laws.  Mine was small, dry and with hardly any vegetables.
When our server came back she said it would do no good for her to complain to the cook or the management, because they wouldn't listen to her and it needed to come from me. She then said she had many similar complaints from customers throughout that week about their omelettes.
So when I received the bill I went to see the manager and he met me with an attitude like \"why are you bothering me\". I explained to him what we had ordered and told him there was a significant quality control problem with his omelettes and that I thought he would like to know.  I thought as a courtesy, I would let him know that he had a food quality problem that his server confirmed. He immediately said that our server never would have said that, and there is nothing wrong with our omelettes or anything else coming out of our kitchen. He as much as called me a liar, so I asked him for his card or at least his name, and he refused and told me if I didn't leave the restaurant he would escort me out and call the police, all because I asked him for his name or card.  I said I'm more than happy to leave the restaurant, but I have to pay the bill, however because you have verbally threatened me twice I am going to make this incident very public.  He at the point informed me that he was also an owner... all the more reason why he should want to hear customer's comments (I was told by another waitress that his name was Chris).
He followed me back to the table and proceeded to threaten my 90 year old mother, my 17 year old Nephew and his parents who didn't even know about our discussion, that if they didn't leave the restaurant he was calling the police! This man's actions were despicable and unprofessional and left my family stunned and appalled.  
My question is, why would anyone consider going to this restaurant when a manager/owner is disrespectful to his customers and frightens his employees."}
{"text":"This place is a rock solid place for breakfast. When you drive up you will, likely, see a ton of people waiting outside - don't let that deter you! They really do move people on and out fast! On a Saturday morning we only waited about 10-15 min. Food was really tasty, service was fast/friendly (especially considering how busy they were), tons of choices, and prices were reasonable. I tried the egg breakfast while my husband hand an omelette - we also got the Nutella banana Crepes to taste test. Everything we had was tasty - I even ate up my pancakes which I typically don't like! Saw lots of kids and families around - nice place for a family breakfast!"}
{"text":"Had simple bacon, egg, and cheesy grits, and it was all divine.  Best breakfast I'e had to date."}
{"text":"I'm going to take a major risk here and say that Butterfield's is one of the best breakfast places I have been to in the valley. Definitely the best one for a sit-down Brunch with friends and family.

Why? the food is freaking LEGIT. (I was tempted to quote MC Hammer but I decided to hold back, so, you know, you're welcome). I ordered a California scramble (eggs, tons of gooey cheese, diced chicken, tomato and avocado) with a side of fruit (berries, melons an grapes) and upgraded my pancake serving to their Wildberry one (pancakes with berry butter on top and more berries). It was enough food to feed me for the entire day and seriously caused me to slow down for the remainder of my morning, not to mention my dreaded Camelback hike.

Everything tasted amazingly fresh and had tons of flavor. The scramble was the best I have ever had because the eggs were fluffy, they did not hold back on the cheese, the avocado was tender and the chicken was seasoned well. It was a decent portion and the side of pancakes was incredibly indulgent- using their home maple syrup and their berry butter. Jesus, my mouth is watering again just thinking about it.

Our server was on point and always ready to refill our water carafes or coffee cups. I saw another table order some sort of latte/hot chocolate drink and I almost pointed and ordered it too because it looked freaking fantastic. My friend ordered the corned beef skillet topped with TONS of cheese, meat, BACON and hash potatoes- super tasty. Other friends got the protein pancakes (or as they called BROTEIN, cause they're douches like that) and they were a bit drier (because of the oats and grains added) but still well done. The only negative I heard was my friend's salad was a little oily, but I did not try it nor can give an opinion of it myself.

I will definitely come back, hopefully after not eating for a week so that I can order everything off the menu and pig out in a very unattractive and uncensored way. Butterfields, consider yourselves warned."}
{"text":"Butterfield's is a great choice for breakfast/lunch. Great tasting omelets and the best fresh-squeezed OJ! Their specialty pancakes are more like pies and take about 45 minutes to prepare, well worth it! Fresh ingredients and I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a seat even on busy days."}
{"text":"Great breakfast...definitely worth the wait!  I enjoyed a ham, mushroom, onion and pepper skillet with over easy eggs, an English muffin and a hot chocolate.  I literally ate everything because it was SO good.  I can't wait to come back and try some of the other tasty items on this extensive menu.  The restaurant is modern and clean, the service is friendly and pretty quick considering the amount of business they do and the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything is good.. eggs verde or Rojo are a hit.. great bacon... usually busy but also prompt and friendly"}
{"text":"We love this place!  We shared the Mexican omelette ( don't know how one person could eat the whole thing) and then got a side of blueberry pancakes with blueberry compote. HEAVEN!"}
{"text":"Great breakfasts!!  My wife had the pecan nut French toast which she said was delicious.  I had the Wildberry crepes with mascapone which were also delicious.  The service was excellent.  

We'll return."}
{"text":"A friend and I came here after I saw it on yelp.  It was really good! We had an omelet, scramble, and French toast. All of them were very good! Not to mention the hashbrowns.  They were different then I've ever had before but really good!!! I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"For being the supposed \"most important meal of the day,\" breakfast is one of those constants in life that people consistently screw up. It's like listening to Neil Diamond's \"Sweet Caroline\" and not doing the bom-bom-BOM!'s during the chorus - it's such a staple of life that screwing it up would immediately draw the ire, suspicion and potential shoulder shrugs of those around you. Fortunately, Butterfield's nails the concept of breakfast, doing so in such a way that their competition probably does not even know where to begin when it comes to matching their quality.

My folks and I stopped in here on a Friday morning and the place was hopping. When we walked in, two different hostesses greeted us and we were immediately seated at a table behind the hostess stand, against the wall. This was actually a perfect spot to be in because it allowed us to take in how Butterfield's is run like a well-oiled (buttered?) machine: the servers move with precision through the crowded dining rooms, the runners know where they need to be and when, and the entire operation moves like clockwork.

Our waitress, Erika, was awesome. Due to us being in Phoenix for less than 24 hours at the time we dined here, there was a very real chance we were not entirely awake and I may have actually been sleepwalking. Nonetheless, she rolled with our dozens of questions and was an absolute picture of efficiency as she kept our drinks refilled and guided us in the right direction when it came to choosing a meal.

Butterfield's is, I gather, known for their pancakes, which makes this next sentence practically heartbreaking: none of us ordered them. My folks had actually been here the year prior and enjoyed the pancakes then, so at least two of the three of us can confirm they are, indeed, delicious. But this time around, they opted for the blueberry crepes and a make-your-own omelette. The results were fantastic, with the food being delivered promptly and devoured almost as quickly. Coupled with an always-full cup of coffee and tasty juice, and you have two meals that come highly recommended.

As for me, I went with the Mexican burrito, because I enjoy a challenge. Not that it wasn't good; it was wonderful! No, the challenge came in the form of the sheer size of the thing. Unless you are part-Sasquatch, there is no way you can pick this thing up and fit it into your mouth. It's a knife-and-fork meal, but wow, is it worth the dexterity required to finish it. Come to think of it, I didn't finish it since I focused my attention to the hash browns. I don't know what they do to these potatoes, but these things are no joke. Possibly the best breakfast potatoes I have ever had, which is a qualifier I never thought I would ever write.

Look, Butterfield's is a breakfast place that knows exactly what they are doing: providing exceptional food and service for an affordable price. They have other locations, and their waiting rooms are equally jam-packed, so clearly they are great at what they do. If you believe breakfast is the most important meal of the day, then this should be the most important stop on your next morning out."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 6 people and a baby. EVERYTHING was delicious !!! Especially the crepe with mushrooms and cheese ! Grits with cheese are also amazing. Since we came on a Sunday we had 35 minute wait but the staff for great and the food was delicious ! I wish they had one in San Diego ! Loved it"}
{"text":"This place rocks.  
Great food , great price , great service.
They are busy but we usually can get a seat within ten minutes 
And the food comes out in seven minutes.
They have it down to a science."}
{"text":"Very good food after a long, long wait for a table at 9:00am last Sunday morning.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong items, but as a diabetic I didn't take the chance on a whole stack o'pancakes, which looked great on others' plates. Instead I ordered the \"bacon waffle\" [yeah, call me a health nut] which was described as having bacon in the batter.  Mine had a strip crumbled on top, but if bacon was also hidden in the waffle I couldn't find it. 
A few last thoughts:  My friend said his cinnamon bread french toast was a-ok. Service was fast, if not cheerful (reminded me of my civil service co-workers); they had a decent sugar-free syrup for me (yay!) and the decor was great.  
Would definately go back and give it another go ... loved the flying pancake mural in the waiting area and the waffle light fixtures ... but I may just stick to JP Pancake instead ..."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place when we first moved here. Everything on the menu made my mouth water. My husband and I have eaten here once and had an amazing breakfast with wonderful service and very little wait time.
Since then we have ordered breakfast for pick up-several times and I've never had not one complaint. I've had the wild berry bliss French toast and it was amazing, but my favorite by far are the banana creme cakes!! Very yummy! 
Highly recommend this spot for some sugary breakfast!"}
{"text":"This might be the best breakfast place ever. Homemade corned beef, perfect, crispy hash, flavorful eggs (!), the toast that doesn't suck, and neverending servings of coffee. Plus the staff is genuinely happy to serve you. Will eat here again, and again..."}
{"text":"Cute breakfast diner type of restaurant.  Serves breakfast all day and other menu items.  The pancakes are tasty!  The omelettes are puffy in comparison to other omelettes I've had before, they're a little dry but nothing a little hollandaise sauce can't cure.  They do not serve alcohol so not really a brunch place.  The portion sizes are big so come with an appetite.  Definitely try this place.  Their sister restaurant Butters is supposed to be good too.  There was no wait when I went but supposedly there is typically a long wait."}
{"text":"I've been to Butterfield's numerous times since my first review and want to say they deserve 5 stars.  The service is always prompt and friendly.  Their egg benedicts are some of the best I've had.  Food is always very fresh and good.  It's now my favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Standard breakfast dishes and big portions, what you read on the menu is what you get.  This place was quite packed."}
{"text":"I have only one word to describe this place.  AMAZING. The food was on another level. The service was great. I try to come out as often as i can and every time I do it doesn't change."}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona, I had to try out this place and I'm glad I did! I went on a Sunday for brunch. There wasn't much of a wait for 2. I made my own omelette with a side of their berry pancakes. Delicious! My friend ordered a chicken sandwich with fries. Seems like it didn't come with a brioche bun as stated in the menu, but it seemed acceptable. Maybe just go for breakfast items as it seems that is what they excel at. Would go again if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Is is one of my favorite places to have breakfast and it's also everyone else's. After 9:00am expect a long wait. BUT, it's definitely worth it. The service is great too. Special requests like \"no butter\" or any specific food prep are honored without question (I love when restaurants do this). So get there early and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pancakes were fluffy and light. Blueberry topping was sweet but not overpowering. Eggs were very fluffy. Sausages were plump, juicy, and flavorful. I don't normally like breakfast potatoes but these were thinly sliced and baked to a light crisp. Delicious breakfast all around."}
{"text":"I had a great late lunch! Service was quick and all my food was served HOT! The person with the coffee pot must be psychic because I never had to flag down anyone for a \"warm up\"(big PLUS in my \"book\")! Great place! Clean friendly, and you never see anyone just standing around! So glad I stopped! Will DEFINITELY come back!"}
{"text":"Had to go here instead of JP pancake for Mother's Day   Worth the wait always good service and food is fresh. I will be back..."}
{"text":"So mediocre. Most people can make better food at home with fewer artificial flavors.  However our server was exceptional."}
{"text":"Pretty solid breakfast joint if you're in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. No way I could go to a pancake house and not order pancakes. I got the good ol' buttermilk pancakes, and they were exceptional. Light and fluffy, the syrup (which is their own brand) definitely hit the spot. They advertise that pancakes take up to 30 minutes to cook, but our order came out no more than 10 minutes after placing it. Decided to get a side of bacon and it was cooked perfect, crispy, very good. My wife ordered the Corned beef hash Eggs Benedict and it was spectacular. In fact, if I make it back to this place I'd order this with a side of pancakes. Hash was really, really good and the poached eggs were good perfectly. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is off the hook good, worth the extra money - the small is very small though so go big or don't go at all.

Service was good enough. Drinks were refilled without asking, server was friendly but very busy (there was a 30 minute wait). 

Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area, looking forward to going back sometime in the future!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Butterfield's 20+ times.  Never once had bad service. Always great food! Coffee stays full! Great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"if you want a great breakfast in North Scottsdale, Butterfields is it! We had the Strawberries and Cream Belgian Waffle and the Wild Berry Stuffed French Toast. The waffle was light, fluffy with just a light outer crust. BUT....the stuffed French Toast was outstanding! A must try...not overly sweet, just perfect. I hear the pancakes are also very good and the bacon was thick and chewy. Definitely worth the stop if you like breakfast. It was recommended by a local and it didn't disappoint. It's a good sized restaurant but looks like it can get busy. They serve breakfast until 3:00 and have a lunch menu, as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! I've waited an hour once just to have brunch! I get the same thing every time and crave it in between fixes! I love the smoked salmon cream cheese scramble with Berry Bliss pancakes! Yummmm! The pancakes have marscapone in the center. I usually get fruit instead of potatoes because it's so much food. Coffee is great too! I also sometimes get a fresh squeezed OJ."}
{"text":"Took my mom here this morning for Mother's Day (yes, I know, Mother's Day was yesterday but mom wanted to celebrate today) and thoroughly enjoyed breakfast. Mom got the apple pancake and I decided to skip my usual go-to dish (veggie omelet) and try the veggie hash. It was really tasty and seriously filled me up all damn day! Instead of poached eggs on top, I opted for scrambled egg whites. Mom loved her apple pancake, stating that it had significantly more apples than what she normally gets at the OPH. She claimed that it was only slightly inferior to the one she normally gets at the OPH but was still highly impressed. My only complaint was that the wait time on the apple pancake was about 30 minutes, when in reality ours came out about in about an hour."}
{"text":"4.5 stars
So we have been here twice so far. We went on a Monday morning end of April, since I read reviews, we were concerned about the wait. This place was full but we got in pretty quick, under 10 minutes. Service was awesome, seriously. We had two waitresses constantly checking on us and our refills. The coffee was excellent, probably the best coffee anywhere. I'm used to coffee being watered down and tasteless in restaurants.  The coffee here is blended special for this restaurant and if they had a drive-thru I would prefer it over famous coffee chains. Coffee is strong and flavorful and free refills! They will even give you coffee to go, if you ask. I got the blueberry pancakes the first time and a side of bacon. Pancakes were light and fluffy delicious, blueberries on inside were a decent portion and lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Pancakes don't come with any sides:(.
Bacon was perfectly crisp and a nice light sweet and smoked flavor. 
My husband got the Mexico Skillet both times, he gets a skillet with chorizo everywhere we go and this was the best.  This particular dish was a bit small in comparison to their other items and to other restaurants, but you get an option to for pancakes as a side.
The second visit I ordered the California scrambler, which I thought would be healthier...it had a super buttery flavor, a bit much for me and I only ate a third. I won't get a scrambler again. I got a side of French toast which in all honesty was a disappointment. It was very plain, I think they need to add vanilla extract and a pinch of salt. My husband's pancake wasn't as good as first time, so maybe just an off day with a cook.  Most recent visit was end of first week of May. We still had excellent service and coffee. Definitely one of our new favorite breakfast spots!"}
{"text":"Most amazing French toast I ever had. Staff was amazing as well. They even let people come right at the closing time and still seated them. There was even an incident where a child spilled a hot beverage on himself and the staff did everything they could to accommodate the family. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Why did I ever wait 3.5 months to experience Butterfields!?!?!! DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!

We got there around 9am on a random, hot Sunday {today}...the benches wedge full of people, standing room only! ...Wait for it......BUT WE ONLY HAD A 10 MINUTE WAIT {there were 4 of us}...how does that happen? 10 minutes and it was for real. We were seated and our waitress was there lickity split! 

Tip #1...get the fresh squeezed juice. It's going to change your opinion on juice. It's the real deal. 

We ordered a scramble and skillet and a side of pancakes {our friends said we couldn't be friends if we didn't get the pancakes} THANK GOODNESS we did. They were fluffy and moist and the right size for a side. They were 'normal person' size not giant size *phew*

Annnnnyway. Butterfields breakfast was delicious. Service was Quick and Friendly they are really great getting people seated without rushing people out he door.

We will definitely be back! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely FANTASTIC! We were in town for a Wedding and this place was highly recommended by the hotel staff! We went on Friday morning so we were seated very quickly and even gave us a booth when we asked to change from a table to a booth. The wait staff was wonderful! Didn't need to ask for anything and always had plenty of coffee and re-fills! Speaking of coffee, I ordered the house coffe and it was delicious! I dunno if it was the coffee or the creamer but it was smooth and a little bold (just how I like it). I ordered the chorizo & avocado omelette and was NOT disappointed. It had a lot of cheese, but other than that it was amazing. My lil bro ordered the pancakes and those were so so fluffy and wonderful! I would definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow-- SO many breakfast options I had a hard time deciding what to order.  They've got skillets, scrambles, and omelets galore.  Not to mention two baked pancakes that sound amazing.  I'll definitely be back to try those.  

During my recent visit I went with the New Mexican Skillet, which consists of eggs, chorizo, avocadoes, cheese, and tomatoes served over nice crispy hash browns.  The chorizo was well-seasoned and not too greasy.  I appreciate that they have the options of egg whites or Egg Beaters, although I dislike the up-charge!  But you can't put a price on health (says the woman eating chorizo and hash browns).  The fresh-squeezed orange juice was delicious.

Portions are huge here.  Supposedly the skillets have two eggs, but I think I got more like 4, and the scramble at another table looked like it had about six.  Even though the place was full, the service was excellent.  Just know that you may have to wait a while for a table if you go on a weekend."}
{"text":"Have been to their other restaurants.left good rating as well. Visited the shea blvd one today, and m disappointed . Not worth the wait . Food was bland. Splty pancakes were too sweet .

Hope to return some other time , but not in near future"}
{"text":"I had some family in town a couple weeks ago and their first morning they were looking for a nice breakfast.  I had heard nothing but great things about this place, so it was worth a shot.

After seeing how reasonable the prices were I was afraid we had just stepped into a fancy IHOP.  I'm glad to say  I was wrong.  The California Omlette was great, though the pancakes on the side seemed a little off.  But I chalk that up to trying to stuff them down my gullet after I was already stuffed by the rest of my meal.  It was a Friday morning so there was no wait, but I can clearly see why it would be packed on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Went here while on vacation in Scottsdale.  As breakfast joints go, this one is near the top of the list.  Fantastic pancakes, decent variety, and friendly staff.

I even went so far as to tell my wife that it was maybe the best overall breakfast I've ever had.  That's saying a lot, considering that I use any excuse I can get to go out for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day.  There was a large line but the wait was only 30 minutes, so don't let a line scare you off, they get you in fast.  The food is good and reasonable."}
{"text":"On our road trip cross country we stopped here for breakfast in Pheonix, Az. Since my last name is Butterfield and this place was so highly rated we had to give it a try. Cianna was our server. She was very pleasant and attentive. My girlfriend always has a complicated order and she had no problem subbing out a few ingredients. She recommended the corn beef skillet which didn't disappoint. I also ordered a side biscuit with white gravy which was phenomenal. My gf ordered eggs Benedict with regular bacon instead of ham and added avocado. The Hollandaise sauce was probably the best we've had. Definitely worth stopping here for breakfast if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Strawberry Shortcake pancakes...awesome!  Just straight up awesome breakfast food.  It's that simple.  Good service, great food, happy stomach."}
{"text":"I kept it simple with four buttermilk pancakes, a side of bacon, coffee, and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The food was great but the service was exceptional.  They brought my food within five minutes of ordering and kept my coffee cup fresh at all times.  The orange juice was great too.  They even went the extra mile to ask if I wanted a coffee to go."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, you have to try the pancakes!! You can get them on the side in place of toast, so that is pretty awesome. Their coffee is probably the best I have ever had at a restaurant, so you should try that as well. The food came out super quick which is always a plus. I would highly recommend checking this place out. The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because the hostesses were NOT friendly at all. But, it was early Saturday morning so I guess who could blame them? Anyway overall it is a great breakfast place to hit up if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a a got to when you got to Scottsdale! Everything is super yummy!! I got the pecan pancakes and OJ!!"}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast food. I ordered the wild berry bliss pancakes, with a side of bacon. Pancakes were not too fluffy and not too heavy, which is the consistency I like. The bacon here is really good- crispy but not too dry and tough. Brewed coffee is robust (my friend told me it's Boyd's)- thumbs up!

In all seriousness, I will return to have another go at the bacon."}
{"text":"Angela is great 
Always remembers my order, gets me in and out, which i appreciate 
Food is always consistent, and good"}
{"text":"I really like Butterfield's. The food is consistently good and, the staff is always on point. I wish I lived a bit closer so, I could go more often."}
{"text":"What more could you want in a breakfast place? Delicious breakfast food, pancakes, french toast, eggs, and good coffee (hard to come by in this type of restaurant environment)!

Service is very, very fast. We have been coming here 2x per week lately because we drop my older daughter off at choir practice before school and have an hour to kill before the other one gets dropped off. I can't think of a better way to kill time than at Butterfield's."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!! First, the service was so personal and warm.  WILLY IS THE BEST!! Seriously, he is the best server I've ever had.  The place was slammed and he was busy as a bee, but still kept his section running smoothly.  Every time he approached our table it was like the whole buzzing restaurant was the tornado and Willy was the calm in the eye of the storm; we were the only people who mattered and he was so serene and happy. It felt like we were at a fine dining experience on a luxurious cruise ship every time he approached our table.

...and the FOOD. Holy Moly! SO GOOD!! It's basic breakfast items, but they are cooked to perfection and with such quality ingredients that it is like a 'foodie' experience in your grandma's kitchen. Love from good food!  Their menu has gluten free notations also!  Their gluten free pancakes are the best I've ever had!  The bacon was thick cut and delicious. The coffee was even very delicious and kept coming and coming.  Our cups were never empty of anything!  Did I mention they have great service??

I currently live in San Diego which is a super 'foodie town' - but they ain't got nothing on Butterfields in Scottsdale.  Butterfields, will you please open a location in San Diego so I don't have to wait for my next AZ visit?"}
{"text":"Best pancakes you will ever put in your mouth! Their maple syrup is divine and they actually sell the bottles! I've tried a quite a few orders on the menu and everything is delicious. Can't complain about any of them. Service is top notch, waiters refill coffee every 3-5 minutes. I come here every single time I visit scottsdale to see family."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere, high marks for the New Mexico Skillet, a favorite of our server, and the creamiest dressed-up grits ever, rich and served in appropriately modest portions. I had mine with a poached egg and requested some fresh spinach on the side which they obligingly provided: mixed it all up for a killah breakfast. Good strong coffee and fresh squeezed OJ.  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Food was not bad, not great as well. We were there with our little one on his stroller. Hostess was kind of rude because of the stroller."}
{"text":"I got the banana chocolate chip pancakes with a side of applewood smoked bacon and I died and went to heaven! It was amazing! the only thing that was unfortunate was that the wait to get it a table was long. The early bird gets the worm!"}
{"text":"Boom I'm the 600th review!!! Should I get a prize?

Butterfield's look this place is money every time. Look at the reviews. So many reviews and mostly all 5s. This place is and always has been ok point. I have never once had a bad experience from the service to the food. 

I had the chorizo omelette and side of pancakes. Got some extra butter on those bad boys. I should be 5000lbs the way I eat. I also had the fresh squeezed OJ that they just throw the oranges in this machine and boom the freshest OJ in the game. Pulpy and seriously the best OJ I have had. The omelette I think has 3 eggs and this thing is massive. The choice of toast or pancakes and I chose pancakes of course. 

The service was great. The coffee is always filled to the max and they give u a of pitcher of water so you don't run out. I have never left hungry and if you do we need to have a talk. Never gonna happen. This place is awesome and my favorite breakfast place to go in AZ!!"}
{"text":"Fast service.
Great selection of pancakes including gluten-free."}
{"text":"went here for break fast very busy place but was able to get seats quick had egg bacon hash browns and oreo smores pancakes every was so good service was good and food was good that's a + for me I be back one day if you are in the area must try."}
{"text":"The food was OK at best...the omelet was not to my liking, over stuffed, and just had a weird appearance to it. The pancakes were flavorless and dry. The fresh squeezed OJ is the best thing they have going for themselves."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome breakfast place!!
We came here with 2 families of four. We were seated pretty quick considering how busy it was. Hostess was very friendly. Food was delicious! I had the hog skillet and it was perfect. Our server was very good. Very attentive and did a great job with our order and answering questions about the menu. Definitely will be back when we visit Scottsdale from Chicago!!!
Highly recommend this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Went there for breakfast on Mother's Day. The food was great, my son got the Oreo s' mores pancakes and said they were amazing. I got an egg dish and subbed my plain pancakes with the Wildberry  pancakes...also amazing! Having recently moved from Chicago I was looking for a breakfast place that even came close to my favorite, Wildberry's Cafe in Schaumburg, and this one takes the cake. They have alot of the same menu items and same taste. If you haven't been I recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"I can't tell if I like this one better then am sonnze 
This place is looking nicer and better service but the other place is just better food . 
The wait time is crazy in both place i guess ( that's what happened one you are serving breakfast ) 
Long story short 
Can't tell much about the food bc I got something so simple ( omelet salmon ) that was good . I will go again just to get a stronger option"}
{"text":"This is family friendley place w/ huge menu that basically most of them are the same in ingredients. Fresh orange juice as others said is great. The rest is a good example of good basic American brunch. Everything absolutly fine, no fancy, no speciality, just basic trustabke nice eggish breakfast."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes! Busy place but large. We are regulars. Line can be long but moves quickly."}
{"text":"A 4-star average?  Really?  I am not surprised by the long lines and crowds because there really aren't any good everyday kind of breakfast places in Scottsdale.  so i guess when the bar is set really low it doesn't take much.  It's as ridiculous as people waiting for The Good Egg.  How hard is it to screw up breakfast?

Yes bacon and waffles are good and bacon in a waffle is good but this isn't original and it isn't a gastronomic feat. maybe i'll return when i'm 65 and  i move 10 feet in 2 hours and have no taste buds left."}
{"text":"I can't believe this only has 4 stars as we have been here several times and the quality  and preparation of the food is superb!  We have had the \"apple pancake\" which is definitely worth the wait, the scrambled eggs are fluffy and light, the bacon is thick and tasty and everything else we have had is top notch.  They certainly don't scrimp on the quantity either!
It's even worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"OK this place is definetely as good as everyone says, they don't make mistakes, the hot chocolate comes in huge cups with whip cream drizzled with chocolate syrup - damn good.  The coffee is Boyds - never heard of it but just strong enough and yes cold fresh cream for your cup of joe.   They give you a lot of food, the 3 eggs and bacon seemed like 6 eggs , (XXX Large?)  anyways - it is great - looks like a lot of locals and they have crayons for the kids - why not 5 stars?   - No tablecloth - just not that fancy smancy and I am saving my 5 stars for those.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Yes, there are tons of older folks there but so what! It's the best omelet I've had in quite a while!  I had the asparagus, pancetta and swiss omelet and hubby had the avocado and bacon omelet.  His was better but both were delicious.  Hash browns nice and browned and the pancakes were much better than Ihops but not to die for.  Will definitely be back!  Oh, and our server was excellent!"}
{"text":"Every time I have gone to Butterfields, I have been really happy with my meal. The omelet I get (Feta and spinach) is light and fluffy, my pancakes are warm with butter melting all over them, the coffee is VERY STRONG, thank goodness for sugar and half and half, and the service is great. 

I have gone early in the morning when there hasn't been a wait, mid morning where you are waiting upwards of 30 mins or more and after 1pm when again there is no wait. All in all, I enjoy Butterfields for breakfast and so far I have not had a bad meal. I hope that streak continues :)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed breakfast here, twice, back in June. Sorry it's taken me so long to review it! The menu is big, and there doesn't seem to be any way to go wrong. My youngest can't get enough of their french toast, my oldest daughter loves their waffles, Dh loves the scramble he got, can't remember the name now, but it was Mexican inspired. I love their omlettes, and the second time I went back I enjoyed their pumpkin bread french toast!! SO good!! They have delicious looking apple puffed pancakes which I plan to sample on my next visit. Their toast is good too! 

Their coffee is good too. Not sure why all breakfast places can't make a good cuppa' joe, but that should be a given. Theirs is so good!!

Just wanted to add another vote for Butterfields!! Wish they put one in Gilbert so I could enjoy it more conveniently!! There's often a wait, but so worth it! We may have to go this weekend :D!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, busy atmosphere that borders on a Chompie's without the NY kitsch. We'll be back for some fresh squeezed OJ."}
{"text":"Delicious and creative. 

It's always am enjoyable experience.  Staff are great,  attentive and prompt.   Food is great"}
{"text":"Holy waffle sundae! Love this place. The wait, as with every place in Scottsdale, sucks. But the food and service were outstanding. The waffle sundae was excellent as was the chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch at 10:30 am.  Recommended by friends.  I had an idea there would be crowds - and there were!  We were given a device to let us know when the table was ready and there's a good amount of seating inside and out for you while you wait. 

I ordered the Mexican Burrito - scrambled eggs, chorizo, green pepper, tomato, onion, jack and cheddar in a flour tortilla.  I had them add a ladle of their chile verde verde sauce over the top.  Served with your choice of potatoes, grits, or fruit.  I selected the hash browns.  

The burrito was well made, filled me up, and was large without being too big with a lot of wasted food.  The hash browns... OMG - best ever if you like yours crispy - not too crispy, but just right.  Best ever.

YUM!"}
{"text":"Wow.
So I went since this place got such high scores from others. I never thought much of this place from the outside. I passed it a number of times and just wrote it off as another corny breakfast place, like all that came before and went out of business in that same location.
I walked in this morning and immediately appreciated the decor... just look at the lights when you go in. Lights hanging from waffles complete with a pad of butter. You can't beat it.
The menu was full of yummy things... I have a list of what I want to get on future visits. Today I decided upon a spinach and feta omelette with potatoes (crunchy hash browns) and two pancakes. Mmm... lots of carbs. I didn't feel so bad since I had noticed the \"pancakes made with whole grain flour\" on the menu. Awesome.
Yeah, the whole breakfast was $7.50. And then OJ- they have a machine that squeezes the oranges right in front of you. It's on the back wall and you watch them throw in oranges and see the delicious nectar drip right into the pitcher that fills your glass (fills, but probably not refills).
Next time I'll try the Baby Apple baked pancakes... or the Lemon Poppy seed french toast with blueberry compote... or maybe one of the fantastic looking skillets... or maybe...

Update:
I tried the Baby Apple pancake. Wow. It was totally worth the wait. The pancake is big enough for two. It was thick with gooey apple goodness and warm cinnamon yummiliciousness.

PS
I have added this to my Greek list because three awesome (read: handsom and friendly) Greek brothers run it. To cater to the Greek community, on Sunday afternoons they offer Avgolemono soup, a Greek chicken, rice, and lemon soup. It's not on the menu. Opa!"}
{"text":"Wow. It has been a while since my beautiful wife and I have been here. The place had had a major facelift and it looks gorgeous!

The food seems to be better also. Everything's was piping hot delicious and so fast.  It was absolutely packed when we arrived. 30 min wait. So worth the wait. Service was 5/5 and so was the food. :) This I the best place for homestyle breakfast."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food! Best biscuits and gravy in town. I love eating here and would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Soooo delicious! I would definitely return for some more wildberry bliss crepe & Irish Benny goodness."}
{"text":"Picked up family from an early flight. The family needed breakfast so we stopped at Butterfield's. First time and it was great! Reasonably priced and excellent service. For a Tuesday morning this place was hopping. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place used to be the best breakfast spot in town.....now I'd prefer Denny's actually. Last time we went the only thing good was the freshly squeezed orange juice. I had eggs that were nasty and potatoes that literally tasted like you were tasting the grille top. Our waitress seemed annoyed to do a refill and was not very nice. Usually very good but not lately :("}
{"text":"Best breakfast! The eggs are so fluffy and all the veggies are fresh! The pancakes are on point! The Banana Creme cakes are the best I have ever had in my life! Our waitress, Ebonique was such a sweetheart and very attentive to our table even tho she was swamped! Will definitely come back on our next vacation!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with anything off the menu here!!! I'm a regular, and although no Bloody Mary or mimosa, they have freshly squeezed OJ and grapefruit juice which is even better!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We had the omelet, scramble, pancakes and those wonderful cheesy grits! Also had the fresh squeezed grapefruit juice! Great, fast service!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, hostess and manager were both rude. I noticed that 2 tables that sat after we did got served first. 

4 out of every 10 people that walked in, walked right back out once they saw the line. 

We waited 35 minutes for a table. This was my first and last time at this over priced Denny's"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Sunday and it was great. The menu is large and everything on it looked good. We tried the baked apple pancake, which was huge and more like a dessert--definitely worth the 30-minute wait. The avocado and bacon omelet was also tasty. We'd definitely go here again and again."}
{"text":"Food and waitresses get 5 stars, manager gets -1 star.  

We came in with a large party of 20. Two tables of 10. They made a mistake and gave 3 checks to 3 different people in our party for the ENTIRE bill.

2 different people in our party ended up paying our entire bill so we payed twice. The third check was on its way to being paid when we stopped our uncle before he payed the bill for the third time.

We brought this attention to the manager and we asked why did we get 3 different checks. 

Manager: \"I don't know \" and walked away.

My aunt called him over again to find out exactly why we got so many checks and who gave them to us.

Manager: \"It's not their job to give you the bill.\" (Even though they gave us the bill.)

My aunt: \"Well who's job is it?\"

Manager: \"It's not theirs. You guys should have said something. \"

My aunt: \"Well, we're saying something now.\"

He walked away to the hostess stand.

We got up to leave and my aunt went to ask him again could someone please explain why we got 3 checks. He told her it was our responsibility to know how many checks we got.

?????????

Manager: \"Just get out, all of you!\"

I was hesitant to write this until I read the NUMEROUS complaints about this manager. 

That said, the food and the waitresses were great. Get the eggs- they are super fluffy!"}
{"text":"Worth the Wait! However make sure that everyone in your party is present otherwise they won't seat you right away. The food and service is spectacular.  The floor, tables and silverware are spotless! My best breakfast place so far! Way to go Butterfields!"}
{"text":"They have the best oj, a great breakfast and the longest wait in town!"}
{"text":"We have given this restaurant several chances.  My crepe came out with hard mushrooms again, after making a request for cooked mushrooms when I ordered, and the cheese was not melted on top again.  My husband potatoes were hard.  They rush the orders.  This time we spoke to the owner, he said that's how they do it there.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Butterfield's! Wait drives me insane, but once you're seated service is very quick and the food is awesome! Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I love everything I've tried here. Skillets, chocolate chip pancakes, huevos rancheros and the breakfast burrito are my favorites! If you want a great classic breakfast in a non-pretentious causal and clean family spot look no more!"}
{"text":"Great service - even on a Saturday AM
Reasonable prices - not cheap
Fresh squeezed juice
Incredible eggs, French Toast and country eggs benedict. 
I would go again and again. 
Clean and big!  
Hot food and a willing to please wait staff... 20% tips everytime."}
{"text":"Visited from the Bay Area to catch a GSW game -- stopped here for breakfast and WOW.  A must for anyone visiting the Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  I went with a party of 4 and we were all impressed.  Great service, ambience and FOOD!!"}
{"text":"Let me start off and say that the service here was incredible.  Especially for our party of 10 including small children.  Our server Will aka Guillermo was amazing. This guy needs a raise.  He was one of the friendliest and efficient servers I have ever met.  This place was packed when we arrived on Thanksgiving morning and still only waited about 20 mins.  Their menu is great with lots of sweet and savory choices.  I decided to try the Swedish cakes since I'm a sucker for lingonberries.  They were delish.  I also got a side of bacon that was cooked perfectly crispy.  They let me add cheese and onions to my hashbowns as well since this is a must for me. The prices are great too which is always a plus.  I would for sure recommend this place to anyone. When you go don't forget to ask to be seated in Will's section."}
{"text":"Oh my, yet another great find from Yelp. It was busy, but our wait was less than ten minutes. The facility is large and open, yet comfortable.  Our server was nice, prompt and the food was delicious. Quite an extensive breakfast menu. Large portions too. I had the Popeye scrambler with chocolate chip pancakes. Eggs with bacon crumbles, mozzarella cheese and spinach."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in early morning on the way in to work. No wait every time I go! 

The protein pancakes are moist and fluffy... Never dry!

The coffee is good (not great) but who can beat drinking as much coffee as you want for 2.29?!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on Yelp, looked at the menu online, and decided to try it out. We were not disappointed. 
We came on a Saturday morning 8:30amish. The parking lot was mostly full and there appeared to be some people waiting, but my husband and I were seated right away.
With so many good options on the menu, it was hard to decide on 1 thing.
I opted for the smoked salmon and cream cheese scrambler. I figured I couldn't go wrong with Nova salmon, onion, scallion, cream cheese & chive garnish. There were big chunks of salmon and cream cheese throughout with just the right amount of onions and chives. I wasn't able to eat all of the eggs, but man it was good. The grits I got as the side were hot and creamy and gone pretty quickly. The hash browns were alright, but I added a little hot sauce.
My husband got pecan cakes, eggs, and bacon. I did try bites of his pancakes and the bacon. Everything was delicious.
Service was attentive. It felt like we were in and out within 30-45 minutes which was perfect since we needed to get to the airport to catch our flight."}
{"text":"I'm under 60 so I'm not quite sure if I'm qualified to comment.  We walked in and I thought I was at the Del Boca Vista community center.  Octogenarians aside, it was a pretty good breakfast.  Not as memorable as Matt's but a step or two above IHOP.  

Hats off for offering Swedish pancakes. Now if I could just find someplace in town that would make me a good √Übleskiver."}
{"text":"This is absolutely fantastic food!  We had to visit twice while here on our short get away because enjoyed our experience so much the first time.  Service was great! Never had to ask for drink refills.  We had biscuits and gravy, wildberry pancakes, strawberry crepes, Belgium Waffles, corned beef hash, wild berry French toast, and the Mexican omelet.  All was amazing! My personal favorite is the wild berry bliss French toast."}
{"text":"Great service, busy on the weekends. One of the best breakfast places in town.
Fast service, great menu. Large fluffy omelettes."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. It's just that good. Best breakfast I've had in the 4 years I've lived in the valley. Pancakes literally melt in your mouth. Skillets are well balanced. Hollandaise is on point. I just hope they open up a location in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Worth the Drive

I was always curious and wanted to stop by and see for myself why Butterfields Pancake House draws such a large crowd. After visiting Butterfields a few times I had my answer, the food is delicious. In fact, everything is delicious in this bustling, get em in, get em out, breakfast spot.

Anyone who has ever dined at Butterfields boast about the pancakes and for good reason. These pancakes are everything a pancake should be, light, fluffy, golden brown,  and very tasty.  Butterfields serves their pancakes with pure maple syrup and pancakes, come with most entr√©e's on the menu.

However, pancakes, arent the only entrees that taste great.  The other breakfast items Butterfields serves up are delicious as well. I really enjoyed the Santa Fe skillet. The chorizo is well seasoned but not overpowering, the onions & avocados are fresh, and the bed of hashbrowns are perfectly crispy.

My lunch companion decided to try  the \"create your own omelette\".  The omelette was large, fluffy, and filled with sausage, mushrooms, and cheese. My lunch companion said, it was the fluffiest and best tasting omelette he's had in a long time.  We both decided to order orange juice with our meal, which at Butterfields is fresh squeezed and delicious. 

The servers are helpful and careful to accommodate your needs.  Butterfields is worth the wait.  I am  interested in going back to try their lunch fare."}
{"text":"A true five star review. Showed up midweek around 1 and they had a wait. Odd for us being frequent diners but speaks loads to them doing things right. Waited about ten minutes outside on the bench before we were notified and walked to the table by the hostess. They were on point, it didn't take long for the busters to turn tables and get another set of diners in. Our server was spend is. She recommended items that were popular and explained to us the baked pancakes.

We love new creative things so we both ordered entrees. The Irish Benny was delicious. The hollandaise was creamy and buttery and the egg poached perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the eggs verde and raved about them the whole time. She saved me a tiny bite and I'd agree.

The baked apple pancake was different and delicious. The server brought us honey and lemon and taught us her strategy and we were very excited about it. There are a ton of different options to try and we can't wait to come back.

It's hard to find a breakfast joint with food let alone a menu that drives you to come back."}
{"text":"I took my family and some friends in town to Butterfield's for a nice breakfast. However, we waited almost an hour to be seated. It seemed everyone was being seated and we were not. We apparently were waiting for two tables to be put together because we were 8 people and this ended up taking an hour. Had I known that it would take so long, we would have left. Once we were seated, we got our coffee quickly and ordered fast since the kids were starving. Food was great, lots of choices and some options I hadn't seen on a menu in years ie: Dutch Babies. Not sure i will come again because the management and hostesses did not manage the flow of customers, their tables or their seating well."}
{"text":"Super cute inside - definitely nicely an updated appearance since my last visit a few years ago. Friendly, almost overzealous service and tasty classic breakfast. 

We had veggie omelette (huge, lots of fresh veggies) with the classic stringy fried hash browns, and the hot cocoa and hot tea were nice, too. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard goods things about this breakfast spot . I had a problem with my entree , my husbands was fine . I asked for a manager and when he came over he was very rude and abrupt . First time I ate here and  it'll will be the last"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food and service!!! Went upon Yelp recommendations and this place definitely did not disappoint.  Appears to be a place enjoyed by the locals, as the crowd on a Sunday morning at 10am was rather long, but well worth it.  Our service was fantastic and got our food to us very quickly.  I ordered the bacon and eggs and chose grits and pancakes as my side.  I opted for the bananas foster pancakes, which literally tasted like banana cream pie (phenomenal).  My wife ordered an omelet and had the berry pancakes as her side, which she absolutely loved.  The prices are very reasonable and portions are huge.  We were stuffed from lunch and it held us over until a reasonably late dinner."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST veggie omelette I've ever had. Huge portions and everything is extremely fresh and hot. Always will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast place. Bottomless coffee and very generous tasty portions. Can't wait to go back. You'll love this place wether your a early riser or a late sleeper, brunch till 3pm."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in town hands down is Butterfield's! I crave the cheesy grits for weeks at a time. The OJ is almost straight off of the tree, eggs fluffy and perfectly cooked, and the baked goods are divine. Be prepared to wait (yes, even at 10am on a Wednesday), but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"I think it's the best breakfast in town. Everything is always good, generous portions, but the best thing is their substitution policy. Go ahead, substitute. Nice when a place wants to make the customer happy."}
{"text":"We've eaten here numerous times and have always enjoyed it.  Their food is fresh and several steps above IHOP.  Their fresh OJ is like drinking liquid fresh oranges . . . oh that's right!  That's what it is!

It's pricier than most pancake houses but I think it's worth it.  It's nicely decorated with lots of light wood and well laid out.  The service is always pretty punctual and attentive.

If you go on a weekend, expect a long wait . . . up to an hour or more.  We try to go on a weekday and we are usually seated almost immediately.  The reason for the long wait is obvious once you've eaten there.  Their breakfast offerings are not your typical ones although they do have all your standard favorites.

I've sampled quite of few of their breakfast dishes.  Eggs Benedict is a personal favorite and theirs is very good.  I also like their buckwheat pancakes.  My wife prefers their crepes.

They are conveniently located in mid town Scottsdale just east of Scottsdale Blvd. on Shea Blvd.

Hands down our family's favorite place to have breakfast when we are visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Butterfield's is always packed for breakfast and lunch and for good reason: it never disappoints. The pancakes are always a good choice, as are the skillets. And the omelets. And the sandwiches. And the salads. Get the picture? The food and service are always great.

They've always taken good care of our family. When my mother was with us they could always accommodate her walker without a problem.

Tip: they have a deal where one day a month you can buy gift cards and get a bonus value added to the card. I think it's buy $100 and get $25 added to the card or something like that. So dad loads his card up once a month when the deal is on. If you eat there as often as my family does, it's worth asking about it."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Butterfield's so I'm not sure what took so long to get here. Fortunately, I encountered it yesterday and still crave the comfort food that rewarded our long hike.

I'll try to be short and sweet but not sure that I can!

The Corned Beef Hash Skillet was one of the best corned beef skillets I've had the pleasure of enjoying. The beef was just right. I don't know how to explain it, but at other places, the beef was stringy and dried out or other places it looked like it was straight out of a can, but Butterfield's corned beef just looked freshly ground (and of course cooked well) and inviting! The over easy eggs were perfectly done and the potatoes were just the right slice thickness and size. 

You automatically get a pancake trio with the skillet, but you can upgrade for a few dollars more to the specialty pancakes. As much as the Oreo s'more pancakes seemed the way to go, I went with the wild berry marscapone pancakes. I loooooved these pancakes. The perfect sweetness and the marscapone filling were such a treat! 

I washed all of this down with freshly squeezed orange juice! Smooth and fresh! What a great way to start the morning!!"}
{"text":"We came down for the Seahawks game, was referred to this place, and we came back Monday as well. Food is awesome, service was great and quick and very clean. I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We had Angela and she was so great and attentive! I would definitely recommend the place to anyone look for a really good breakfast at a really great price you're gonna want to go here! I had the berry crepes and they were sooo good! My friend had the fried egg bagel sandwich and it was to die for! Go go go!"}
{"text":"Omg! I need to stop coming here..im gona get so fat!! Man where do i start ...california scrambler with wildberry bliss crepes or the cinnamon pancakes. Service is great but expect about a 20 min wait...its just that good! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"WoW! Amazing place! Our family of 7 stopped here while on a staycation at the Westin. All 7 of us had something different and every single one of us enjoyed our breakfast, all made to perfection!  :) Great portions great service. Short wait and it was a Saturday. Open and airy decor. LOVE IT !"}
{"text":"Ya know .. I don't get it .. seems like a small step up from an IHOP or Denny's .. maybe it's just me."}
{"text":"Not sure why they turn the AC in this place down so much that it is freezing in here.  Dress warm when you come even if it is 117 degrees outside. 

The Wildberry Bliss French Toast is to die for.  So good.  5-stars.

The Biscuits and Gravy is good.  Biscuits are fresh made and gravy is home-made.  Good taste but not great.  4-stars."}
{"text":"It's true! After several failed attempts to eat at Butterfield's due to the long wait time, I can finally say that I've finally had the chance to actually eat here. So what did I think? It was most definitely worth the wait! 

There's a reason Butterfield's has a two hour wait on the weekends. It's because this isn't your average breakfast. They don't just have basic omelets and pancakes on the menu. No, they have succulent skillets filled with cheese, hashbrowns, eggs and toppings galore. They have buttermilk pancakes with different flavors such as Oreo cookie pancakes. They have bacon Belgian waffles. They have oven baked pancakes! The menu is large and in charge and this breakfast definitely leaves you full for the rest of the day! 

During my first official visit here, I ate my heart out. I ordered the Santa Fe Scrambler which comes with eggs (I opted for egg whites), Chorizo sausage, red jalape√±o pepper, onion & cheddar cheese. All this sits atop freshly made crispy hashbrowns. As if that's not enough, the scrambler comes with your choice of pancakes or toast. Of course I ordered the homemade buttermilk pancakes! The feast arrived relatively quickly and it was absolutely a feast! There was no way I could finish the meal, but every bite I took was better then the next. The hashbrowns were the perfect amount of crispy and the Chorizo had a nice kick to it. The avocado and peppers blended in quite nicely and there was plenty of cheese to go around! I doused my buttermilk pancakes with Butterfield's homemade syrup and wow, they know how to make a carbtastic pancake! I wish I could have consumed every last bite, but I ate until I was full and left happily full!

I'm so happy that I've finally had the chance to eat at Butterfield's. Now that I know how delicious the food is, the wait time won't seem so bad anymore."}
{"text":"OMG YUM! My friends and I are on a mission to find some of the best breakfast joints in Phoenix and this one is phenomenal! Where else can you order an omelet with hasbrowns and get a side of pancakes too, for like $10?! I have been back 3x and love trying new things every time. The salmon omelet as well as the spicy chorizo omelet are great, the stuffed friench toast and berry pancakes are amazing and the fresh squeezed orange juice is a must for first time diners! The decor is cheesy but who cares when the food is so good?! Top breakfast place for sure."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here twice while in town for a few days..... Yummy Dutch baby... substituted jalepenos for the spinach & Cajun chicken sausage for bacon on the Popeyes scrambler - YUM! The o.j. is squeezed right in from of you (my 10 yr old wants us to buy one now) & is great. The place is IMMACULATE, service & food super speedy, but the piece de la resistance, IMHO, are the grits. I am a true Southern girl, have lived in or visited all the Southern states.... & that includes tasting the food everywhere ;-). These are, hands down, some of the best grits on the face of the earth! I'd like to go visit Scottsdale again, just to go here!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came here for a mid-week brunch after the first day in summer school. It was busy but we were seated soon as we arrived. All of the staff was very pleasant. The waitress did not over bother us, which is always a big plus for someone like me who doesn't like people watching them eat or bother them while I am eating lol. The portion sizes are not gigantic but much larger than a bistro style caf√©. We try the Irish Benny, the Irish Hash, the cheese grapes which were extremely creamy! And we also tried a stack of the Oreo cookie pancakes we added peanut butter and syrup and it was simply delightful! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Yumm!  Only tried the Florintine Eggs Benedict, but ate every bite!
They were really really busy but did not rush us.  Even when we were finished eating, they cleared away our table and let us sit and chat for about 20 minutes longer."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Probably in my top 3 favorite places to get breakfast in the valley. 

Weekends usually have a bit of a wait for a table, but once you order the food comes out within a couple of minutes! 

The berry bliss pancakes are a must try! So delicious, with cream drizzled on top and in between the pancakes! 

The California scrambler is also a GREAT dish if you are wanting an egg breakfast! 

Biscuits and gravy are very delicious, better than most places I've tried. Creamy sausage gravy with some thick and yummy biscuits! 
 
Definitely must try this place! You won't be disappointed! Great service and amazing food!"}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast joint that I have ever been to.  I love the food, I love the staff.  If you ever get the chance, make sure you stop by to treat yourself to some of the best food in town."}
{"text":"It was good, went on Fathers day so the place was packed!! They had coffee, water and some donuts out for everyone waiting, which came in hand when my 6 yr old nephew started getting HANGRY so that saved us from a meltdown. 

server was attentive, food came out delicious just didn't come out all together so that was disappointing. do you wait for everyones food to hit the table then eat and have your food get cold, or do you start eating without the rest of your family on fathers day. 

but i had the mexicana omelette super good, you can share with your loving sister or not, and force her to get something else lol .. will I be back? If I am in the area,yes"}
{"text":"Best breakfaat place in scottsdale by far! Pancakes, eggs, bacon are all what youd expect from a higher end pancake house. Yum"}
{"text":"Corporate chain restaurants aren't usually places I visit often, and when I do I generally have much scrutiny and suspicion. I know that might sound bad but I have good reason, Ive been burnt way to many times. Ive dealt with horrible service, unimaginative food and the whole annoying corporate shtick, complete with high chairs and screaming unmanageable children. Please don't get me wrong, Ive had similar disasters at locally owned restaurants, but knowing I'm keeping my hard earned money in the community makes that brutally shrieking kid a little less bothersome.

The North Scottsdale location of Butterfield's caught me off guard. I was all primed to dislike everything, but was surprised with a few of the dishes and the service was fast, efficient, and well, annoyingly friendly. How anyone can be that chipper at 7:30am is beyond me.

Being a small national chain, only 4 location, they are complete with lame corporate shtick. Look up in the massive dining room and you'll see pictures of buttered and syrup laden waffles on the ceiling. Then there's the behemoth menu complete with \"Egg-ceptional\" Eggs and \"Egg-cellent\" Specialties, I wonder who makes this stuff up? I suppose some will find this clever.

With such a huge menu it took a few minutes to try to find the unique and interesting dishes. Started out with the Dutch Baby ($7.25); a large oven baked pancake that's finished with lemon juice, powdered sugar and optional syrup. The texture is light and airy comparable to a crepe with a crisp edge. Order this upon sitting, it could take up to 30 minutes to make depending on how busy the restaurant is.

Biting into something heartier, The Bacon and Onion Skillet ($7.95) was well portioned for the low price tag. Crispy hashbrowns, bacon, grilled onions, 2 eggs with your choice of cheese and bread, was simple and satisfying.

Butterfield's originates from Illinois, so I should have given the Mexican Egg Burrito ($8.25) a little more thought before ordering. A whole wheat tortilla with chorizo, eggs and cheese, then in little plastic cups were sides of tasteless guacamole and salsa. Maybe in Illinois this is considered good but here in the land of Mexican food, it was a complete failure.

Sticking with the classics is a good idea, like the Country Benedict ($7.95). Perfectly cooked sausage patties on country biscuits then topped with eggs and country gravy. Though really, pretty much anything with pork and or egg yolks is going to be tasty.

When ordering try not to change your selection to much, it's $.75 for every substitution you make. For instance, the Popeye Scramble ($7.95) comes with monterey jack cheese but to have feta instead as well as yellow onions, added $1.50 to the bill. I mean really, scrambled eggs for close to $10 just doesn't make any sense.

Scrutiny and suspicion aside, with so many breakfast choices out there Butterfield's isn't necessarily the best option, but if you're looking for a change up, this might be something different."}
{"text":"Love this place. We need one on the west side.  Great OJ and love the veggie hash and the savory crepes."}
{"text":"Let me tell you, this place is AMAZING!! My husband and I drive all the way from Chandler to eat here and every time we do (2x per month) it never disappoints. We literally have dreams of how good the wildberry bliss pancakes are. It's well priced and worth every penny."}
{"text":"the portions are generous and the food is quite tasty. the wait staff was some of the friendliest in town, and it's all very reasonably priced. it's obviously a good place to eat because there were a slew of people waiting. worth the wait."}
{"text":"Finally, I was able to stop by Butterfields for the first time.  (The line is usually pretty long on the weekend.). Thank God for Columbus Day and a day off from work .   The wild berry pancakes are so freaking awesome, makes you want to slap your mama!   Better yet, I wanted to go into  the kitchen and slap the cook for making such a delicious masterpiece.   Lastly, The grits I ordered tasted superb with perfect consistency.   I could have drank a 16 ounce glass of that alone."}
{"text":"We live in CA and came here over spring break.   This place is yummy!!  Service was amazing and fast.  Place is crowded but way worth the wait.  
Best meal by far this whole trip!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere,  waffles painted on the ceilings!  Always busy but worth the wait! The pancakes melt in your mouth and the crepes are delicious and coming from a french chef that a huge compliment!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had! Banana cream pancakes were AMAZING! Definitely will be back! Service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I have to say this was a good find. The food was great and the service even better. For as big and crowded as it was everyone of the workers were giving great service."}
{"text":"In town from Texas--We wanted homestyle cooking.  Breakfast is excellent!  Delicious coffee is locally grown and orange juice is freshly squeezed. Staff is immensely helpful.  Thank you Team Butterfield's!! You absolutely rock!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Butterfield's for brunch after church recently. The wait was at least 30 minutes -- it's a popular spot. The pancakes looked beautiful but I was keeping it healthy, so I went with the veggie hash that had sweet potato, white potato, corn, brussel sprouts and onion topped with two poached eggs, and an english muffin. It was tasty and the eggs were prepared well but the veggies needed a little seasoning. 

Overall, it was an adequate breakfast but not sure it was worth the wait. 

Heads up: the juice machine (orange or grapefruit available) is serious business!"}
{"text":"Worth the 35 minute wait. Our server Erika was great. Well oiled at getting people from check in to table.  Watching the servers and bus staff work together is like pairs ice skating! Well done Butterfield's!"}
{"text":"Menu selection is quite extensive here.  If you're an indecisive person when it comes to food, this is not the place for you.  I think the waffles and the pancakes are the items to try here.  We tried two french toasts (apple cinnamon and the classic).  Both were so so.  But those that ordered the pancakes and the waffles seemed to be pleased with their selections.  The egg entrees were ok.  The jambalya egg dish was primarily egg and hardly any filling.  The southwester omlette was quite tasty.  As for portion sizes, most were pretty substantial. Now looking back, I wish I tried the apple pancake that takes 30 minutes to make.  That looked really good.

This place is very packed so be prepared to wait.  Not a bad place for a hearty, no frills meal."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast in town. My family LOVES their cheesy grits. We also truly believe they have the best coffee. We have not found any other place that has coffee as good as Butterfields! We go every week and have not stopped coming since they've opened. If you get a chance to come here you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for breakfast - Swedish Pancakes were awesome and so were the eggs & ham, fruit, coffee, etc., service, cleanliness of the place and prices."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and the service and food were both amazing!! Angela was very patient with us by explaining the menu options and helping us pick the perfect meal for our tastes! I had the baked potato omelette with the Cinnabon pancakes. I couldn't stop eating they were so good!! I would definitely recommend this place, as well as Angela to any of my friends!!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite breakfast spot!
Hands down the options are numerous but not overwhelming. And in the event you decide you'd like lunch for breakfast no problem. The chicken salad with cranberries and pecans are amazing"}
{"text":"This place should actually be called Butterfield's and Associates Cardiology.  If you are looking for an egg white with veggies omelette and a side of turkey bacon, I'm sure you could.  However, their specialty is found in their name--butter.  Everything is butter tasty.  

Their pancakes so good that after having them, we craved them for the next week.  They vary is tasty extremes, going from the normal buttermilk (there's the butter again), to gluten free, to Oreo cookie and s'mores pancakes.  Their short stack is an excellent side though a good meal in itself.  My personal favorite is their wild berry pancakes and their blueberry pancakes.  Both are stuffed with berries and the wild berry is smothered in cream.  I am gaining calories just by writing about them.  You want French Toast or waffles, they have those too. 

We all had various items off the menu.  I chose a Create- Your-Own-Omelette with Nova Lox, cream cheese, red onion, and a side of hollandaise sauce. Another member of our group tried the Mexicana omelette.  Mmmm...finally decent chorizo in a non-Mexican restaurant.  The omelette came with avacado, cheese and a green chile sauce.  Besides omelettes, Butterfield's also has skillets, scramblers and other egg specialties.  

The only problem I saw was the waitstaff and the wait.  This is a large, popular restaurant.  With so many people, there is an initial wait and then there is also a wait for our food.  If you go, try an off time.  What ever do, don't go on a Sunday morning!  You will wait at least 45 minutes and then wait 30 for your food.  Other than that, this is a wonderful breakfast place to take family and friends."}
{"text":"Ordered the New Mexico skillet $9.95 comes with choice of toast or pancakes . Contains chorizo sausage, onions, tomato, avocado and green peppers topped by two eggs of your choice served on a base of scalloped potatoes. Chorizo is spicy and the portion size very generous. Even the scrambled egg looked like at Least three!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint ever.  Beats the Good Egg, US Egg and any other breakfast places in the area.  High quality breakfast fare.  Perfectly poached eggs.  Fluffy pancakes.  Fresh potatoes cooked to perfection.  Super clean nice decor.  No cafeteria smells as is common in most breakfast joints.  Amazingly fast and friendly service.  Food served hot and piping.  Business is so good there is usually a wait even on weekdays (during the winter) but since service is fast, the wait is never longer than 20 min)"}
{"text":"Love the fun! you can close your eyes and order, everything is good! i'm always looking for a reason to go there. Butterflied and butters have the same menu."}
{"text":"This place got too much hype. Wasn't impressed..."}
{"text":"Yum! Went on a saturday morning at 11am and had a 15 minute wait for two people. Service was prompt, our drink order was taken right away and the food didn't take long considering how busy they were. Ordered the florentine Benedict with amazing cheesy grits and blueberry pancakes which were delicious. My boyfriend had the smoked salmon scramble which was apparently a little too fishy. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, long wait. The pancakes are dry and fall apart when cutting. If you want to experience great pancakes, check out The General Store in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is the go-to breakfast joint in Scottsdale. The wait on the weekend can get a little steep, but trust, it is so worth it. Their whole hog scramble and berry crepes are heaven in my mouth! And to wash down the goodness, don't forget to get their fresh-squeezed OJ. YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding place for breakfast. A wide range of options. We had the Popeye scrambler, the special stuffed French toast, and more tasty treats. The service was great. We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh breakfast, you're my best friend. Let's be pals forever and for always.

Butterfields offers so many choices, it's almost absurd. You can choose between breakfast or lunch.. Although for me, it's no contest. Breakfast wins every time. 

The skillet I ordered started with a hash brown base, topped with peppers, chorizo and avocado then topped with two over easy eggs. It originally came with cheese, but they left it off for me. This comes with your choice of pancakes or grits. I picked whole wheat pancakes. Sooooo good. Everything was delicious. Even the fresh squeezed OJ and I don't even really like oranges. 

The service was very friendly and prompt. I could seriously eat just about everything on the menu. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I love the food at Butterfields. Most recently I tried the whole wheat french toast, with a side of strawberries and bacon. The french toast was very light and fluffy and not dripping in egg batter. Our server was friendly and fast. I've never had bad service here!

My only cons are the prices. They charge $2 for a side of strawberries, which would be fine except it was literally ONE strawberry sliced up. A side of bacon (4 pieces) is $3.95. I wouldn't mind paying that for a thicker cut...maybe even peppered bacon, but this wasn't anything special. 

I definitely recommend Butterfields. If you go on a weekend, plan to arrive before 9:30 or be prepared to wait AT LEAST 30-45 MINUTES. But you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Met a friend her for breakfast and it was my first time. All the waitresses were very nice and polite. I got Belgian waffles and turkey bacon. The waffles were cooked great and not hard. My friend had the chicken sausage and those were so tasty and had such great flavor. I am so glad I found a new breakfast spot, I will definitely be going back soon"}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. Hands down the best omelets I have found in Scottsdale! I live in Tucson but every time I come, this is a trip I have to make. Every time I come, there is a wait, but the wait was always shorter than the hostess said. The food also came out amazingly fast. The restaurant turned tables very quickly. Great for breakfast dates, family events, or just to eat by yourself!"}
{"text":"I've never been a breakfast person....if there's one meal that I habitually skip, it's brekkie. Mainly because I either: 

A. wake up just in time to get my ass out of bed, shower, get dressed and make it to work on time

B. If it's a weekend, I've slept in past breakfast.

or C. If it's a weekend, I'm in a hurry and don't have time to wait to be seated.

All of these notwithstanding, Butterfield's is one of the those places that has forced me to SERIOUSLY reconsider my attitude towards breakfast.

Here's why:

Their sausage links are SO damn good. Being the creature of habit that I am, I got my usual breakfast consisted of sausage, poached eggs (poached egg haters, HUSH!) hash browns and white toast.

Back to the the sausage: HUGE and bursting with flavor: not too spicy, certainly not bland. The Hashbrowns were delicious: freshly cut and cooked in butter, not rancid lard. Eggs poached perfectly. 

To top it off, FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE and delicious coffee. 

The place looks like it was an old CoCo's that was brightened up a bit. You'll still feel like you're in a coffee shop so expect a cheerful but not fancy atmosphere. Trust me, once you've taken a few bites, you won't give two shits about the atmosphere.

Seriously one of the best breakfasts I've had and it's right here in my backyard.  If you want a good brekkie in The Valley, check these guys out...you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I'm just going to start off by saying that I am not really a huge breakfast man, however, this place is awesome.  The service is great and always gets your food out extremely fast.  Even when it is really busy, you never wait for a table for more than 15 minutes.  My favorite dish is the taffy apple french toast, it is unbelievable and really filling. I have been here many times and tried about half the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"First breakfast of our trip in AZ.  We had about a 20 minute wait, and it was worth it!  The fresh OJ was amazing.  I had a skillet and my husband had an omelette.  The food was incredible.  The service was amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of Butterfield's Pancake House & Restaurant for several years.  The food is consistently delicious and the service consistently exceeds my expectations.  I highly recommend visiting this wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!  If you want an awesome breakfast, this is your place!  Best orange juice, hands down, then anywhere I've ever been!  Husband had Whole Hog Skillet and toast.  I had Vegetable Omelet, hash brown potatoes and a side of pancakes, that I gave to my husband.  Those pancakes were to die for...I got one bite!  :)  The omelet and potatoes were so huge that I barely got 1/2 if it down before quitting!  Our tummies are very satisfied right now.   Besides the food, the service was great and the restaurant was nice and clean!  Only negative is the two stall ladies room which had a several person line the two times I went in."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Heading out of Arizona and stopped here for breakfast. There was a little bit of a wait but the customer service and food was excellent. My coffee was always full, never had to ask for a refill. I recommend the pancakes with the berries!!! Omg"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! The portions are huge, the food is great, and the service couldn't be better. You would think for such large portions you would have to wait a lot longer after your order. The wait isn't too long and everything tastes homemade. 
One little secret here is the hot chocolate. I don't know why, but it's the best hot chocolate I've had. We always make sure to get it when we come here. 
Saturday morning expect to wait for a table for a long time, lots of people come for breakfast. Try to go on a weekday morning and the wait isn't bad."}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  Our server, Iulia was genuinely sweet, very attentive and all around good at what she does.  We ordered the Raspberry Sunrise pancakes.  They were topped with fresh raspberries, a raspberry sauce and a marscarpone cream sauce.  It was just the right blend of raspberries with cream. We also tried the New Orleans French Toast topped with sauteed bananas.  Both dishes were great.    Very happy with our first experience at Butterfields!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and we went Saturday morning around 10AM for breakfast. 15 minutes wait and got the table for 2. 

Ordered Denver Omelet and Country Benny. We were served the food in minutes. This is impressive considering the place was full of customers. My wife didn't finish her Benny and my omelet was watery. Protein pancake was not bad. 

The server was polite enough and did her best but she looked very tired. 

Overall I'm not impressed at all and can't understand why this place is full of customers and has good rating. I guess I will go to Egg and I at Via Linda next time."}
{"text":"Man, oh man was it delicious. I love that my scrambler and his skillet came with two (or three) pancakes of our choice on the side. the banana crime cakes are out of this world!! I scarfed them down along with everything else. their freshly squeezed OJ was fantastic as well. despite the not so diverse Scottsdale crowd and funky looks from the people outside (not unusual for us), we were treated just the same and we appreciate that service!! we will be back and I can't stop raving about this place!! SO YUM YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"I have ate here and ordered take out here multiple times. They are very consistent with fast service and amazing food. Hands down the best biscuits and gravy in town. Very good eggs, coffee, wraps, oatmeal, salad and sandwiches. There is really nothing that I have ordered that I have not been happy with. The service is amazing and very quick. I am glad I work right across the street, it's great for lunch and late breakfast!"}
{"text":"They serve fresh squeezed (real deal) orange juice and serve a delicious breakfast. This place is off the charts"}
{"text":"Arrived 10am on a Wednesday and on a wait as usual. There's a reason for that, because they are that good. I waited for about 10 min (only me in my party) and was seated. Server was VERY prompt showing up about a minute after I was seated. She was very pleasant and gave me plenty of time to look over the menu. I ordered the Santa Fe scramble with hashbrowns and pancakes. My order arrived in under 5 min and they were slammed! Food was hot and delicious as usual. 

Watching the staff work was like watching a professional sports team. Bussers were clearing tables seconds after guests left and guests were being seated as the busser made his last swipe with the cleaning cloth. These people do it right and if anyone says you can't expect this at less than a 5 star place, they're dead wrong. Point them to Butterfield's."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome, which explains the brief wait at 1130 on a Wednesday. The Banana Cream French Toast was so delicious. I expected it to be topped with whipped cream, but was pleased to find a light custard, similar to banana cream pie. The Denver Omelette and Eggs Benedict were also fantastic. The service was friendly. We loved our waitress Ebony. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am kind of obsessed with Butterfields' Gluten Free Pancakes! They are seriously to die for, and you can't tell they're gluten free! I have been back many times just for a stack of pancakes, and I even get them to-go sometimes ;)

Their \"skillets\" are also super delicious- hashbrowns topped with your favorite things, like cheese, veggies, and chorizo, plus 2 eggs cooked your way. Yum!"}
{"text":"Just returned from my stay in Scottsdale  it was just OK 
not worth the money i went back to Good Egg 
the menu changed an i felt incredibly rushed 
will not return"}
{"text":"I was dining here when I saw that a woman had spilled her drink. She was assisted by the wait staff in cleaning up the mess. They had borrowed napkins from the neighboring table and when they realized they had missed some, the asked the other table to borrow some more. At this point, the owner scolded the family for excessive napkin use and that they MUST ask him for any extra napkins. The family told him they just wanted to finish their meal and move on from what now had escalated to an ordeal. I overheard the husband ask the owner for another napkin as they had been directed and the owner snapped!! He called them smartasses and excessively yelled at them calling them horrible names. He then proceeded to kick them out (though I'm sure they would have left ASAP regardless due to his behavior) and told them he was CONTACTING THE POLICE for disorderly conduct. I'm not sure what resulted but as someone with connections to law enforcement, it seemed that the owner was harassing the family with his verbal assaults not the other way around. He's lucky they didn't call the cops on him. 

To the owner: I know owners are encouraged to respond to reviews. DO NOT respond to mine or I will contact the BBB. There is nothing to discuss. Also, screaming, \"FUCK YOU!\"  in anyone's face, let alone a woman's, is never respectable."}
{"text":"I finally made it into Butterfield's for breakfast today... I had high expectations after reading many of the reviews that came before mine.  I was not let down at all.  It's a more local version of an IHOP with extremely fresh ingredients, a more lively atmosphere, and attentive service.

We sat in a comfortable booth - It was a funny scene as Kevin N and I went in with our computers and cell phones and both called into a conference call while we ate our breakfast. (We did this so he could eat before jumping on his flight back to Austin).

I had multi-grain blueberry pancakes with a side of egg whites.  I requested sugar-free syrup and got it within seconds.  It was delicious and the perfect breakfast for the day after an elite event (slight hangover).  Kevin had one of their specialty oatmeals and a side of bacon.  It looked and smelled really good too!

It was my first trip to Butterfields but it won't be my last - yay... another breakfast place in the Valley :)"}
{"text":"Good service: Server always checked on my coffee and always asked how we were doing

Food: Ordered the Patty Melt at 9:45AM (brunch food!!!). Patty was perfectly cooked at medium rare. Very juicy! Would have wanted additional seasoning on the housemade chips. Wife ordered Mexican skillet. Chorizo was really good. Potatoes were seasoned well. Eggs over easy were cooked correctly. Food overall was outstanding"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Good portion size for the money. Everything we tried has been good. Fresh squeezed orange juice is $6 for a large and i think $4 for a small and no free refills. Place is usually busy which is always good sign."}
{"text":"This place has great breakfast . My kids went crazy. My son ordered the Oreo s'mores pancakes. He was literally shoveling them in his mouth and had his plate clean in a matter of minutes.   Needless to say this is a for sure place we will come back to"}
{"text":"It was a great treat to happen upon this delicious place! The food, service, and ambiance were delightful!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! My dad and I were visiting from the Bay Area and I'm sad we have no places like this! We arrive there at prime time which was around 12:00pm. The kind hostess told us it would be about 15 minutes and it ended up just taking less than 10! I love how many options the menu offered and great prices too. Our sever was very nice and checked on us a lot, even the manger came by our table and asked how we were and talked for awhile! I love this place I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Butterfield's is definitely my go-to breakfast spot! 

The food is inexpensive and yet, still pretty damn good. We're not talking high class breakfasts, but the food is familiar and comfortable which keeps me coming back for more. 

I consistently order their chocolate chip pancakes and they never disappoint. Fluffy, buttery, and sweet = DELICIOUS. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is great too.The service at Butterfield's doesn't disappoint. I don't know if I've ever seen bussers clean a table so quickly. 

If you come on a weekend, you can pretty much guarantee a wait. Luckily, the people-watching here is so much fun that the time flies by. The atmosphere is typical of a breakfast spot...open, noisy, and relaxed. If you're a Scottsdale or Phoenix resident you can often count on running in to someone you know. So if you're slightly hungover and still wearing your clothes from last night you may want to find a new place to help soak up that alcohol...if not, that's great too....be proud of your walk of shame!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.  I really, truly love their pancakes...they are little, golden and crispy.  The selections on the menu can be a bit overwhelming... I really like their lox and bagel combo (with a side of pancakes of course!).  The coffee is served with real cream and the service is always excellent.  The wait can be a bit much..a kin to say the DMV...so we try and get there either really early or really late..."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND

Well, I've heard so much about this place and was near by, so I stopped in to check it out.

The place was packed and the crowd spilled out to the front patio. I finally made my way to the hostess to put my name on the list. They take your phone number so they can call you when your table is ready, and you can track your progress on an accompanying app, which is kind of cute.

Anyway, I sat outside on the bench for about 15 minutes. I was surrounded by a gaggle of retired folks in super casual clothes. I texted my friends, \"I don't think I fit in here.\" And I didn't, but I was hungry.

SERVICE EXPERIENCE

I finally got the call that my table was ready. The manager was extremely nice and sat me at my table. 

My server came by right away. She was EXTREMELY SWEET.

I got the berry blintzes, corned beef hash, thick bacon, fresh orange juice and coffee. DELICIOUS.

I was enjoying everything until I noticed a man just staring at me... Like NON-STOP staring. I thought he would eventually stop, but he didn't. He saw that I noticed, so he put on his baseball cap and his sunglasses and covered his face with his hands, but wouldn't stop staring. I debated telling the manager, but I just left instead.

CONCLUSION

It seems like the restaurant is VERY WELL run and managed. The food was fantastic. Unfortunately, the crowd the place attracts is not my scene. 

4/5 RECOMMEND

OF NOTE

*There is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Bold coffee (decaf or regular!)  great menu items. Food served fresh from kitchen. Bill states \"The most fluffy omelettes). Lots of attention from service people! Spacious, clean, lots of parking. My favorite breakfast: blueberry crunch oatmeal. Very popular place in this area. One of our favorite places for breakfast. Conveniently located. No complaints about anything here!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a breakfast place. Beats ihop and Denny's. The wait is a little much but the food is worth it. The only thing I don't like is the prices on the juice. $5 for a glass of orange juice? Little extreme but its worth it. Their baked pancakes are heaven. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I had already been to Butters so I knew the food was good. I tend to go to breakfast when places open so waiting for a table is never a problem. Sometimes they are not quite ready for customers though. Here they were fully ready when the doors opened. Instead of leaving a large portion of my food still on the plate when I was full I just had a side order of corned beef hash and a side of cheesy grits. I also had some potatoes from my friends meal. Good choice as I was plenty full. Food and service was good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"You'd better be hungry when you come here because the food is great and the portions are, too.  We've tried a lot of things on the menu and they were all good. Their waffles with real maple syrup and some fresh, thick sliced bacon on the side was so yummy! I order a side of scrambled eggs and they were so light and fluffy - the best scrambled eggs I ever had!  My family has had pancakes, omelettes, eggs Benedict...everyone has said their food was delicious.  It gets busy so you may have to wait for a table on weekends (send someone early to get a pager and wait.)"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast.  I have eaten there a few times and always want to go back!  Waffles, pancakes etc. are excellent!"}
{"text":"Butterfield's is open and airy with great ventilation. It is wheelchair accessible with plenty of comfortable seating. This is a great place for groups as well as children. 

Our waiter, Stanley was amazing. He was very polite and attentive and made our visit pleasant. 

Although the menu does not reflect it, the food is actually light and cooked in a healthy manner. No heavy oils, grease, or extra sugar, etc.  

Lots of available parking and comfortable waiting area inside and out. 

Oh and the restrooms are also clean."}
{"text":"I think this place deserves 4.5 stars but I am upping to 5 stars for one simple fact. Bacon Waffles!

Visited Butterfields while on vacation last weekend. I was told to expect a long wait, but was surprised to be seated within ten minutes of walking in. The menu was intense, a lot of choices to choose from especially when your stomach is rumbling.

Settled on the farmers scramble, and ordered a bacon waffle on the side to share. The scramble was perfect. My over medium eggs were spot on. Non of that runny egg white crap. The hash browns were golden and crispy. Mixed with the egg yolk, made the perfect breakfast. This scramble was loaded with ham, sausage and bacon, mushrooms, tomatoes, broccoli and onions, and lets not forget the half pound of melted cheddar and jack on top! 

I thought it couldn't get better until I moved on to the bacon waffle! I can't even begin to write about the greatness of this waffle. I just recommend that you order it! 

Great service, good prices, and incredible breakfast :-)"}
{"text":"Great food but the 3 young girls working check in completely ignored me when I asked for them to keep the front doors closed when people were not entering or leaving. It was very cold that day and my 5 year old was freezing and the open doors were not only making us uncomfortable but making our food cold. They could have cared less what I had to say and just turned their backs on me! Not one word. Not an I am sorry not a we will do our best. JUST SILENCE!. They ALL need a lesson in customer service...."}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting from California and decided to have breakfast here...it did not dissapoint. Seated immediately, pleasant staff and the food was served faster than expected. The potatoes are nothing short of amazing. We're glad we stopped in and will definitely be back when we're in town."}
{"text":"It is crazy to find this place in Arizona! I've been going to Butterfield's in Illinois since I was a kid. Even after we moved from Illinois we would eat at Butterfield's whenever we visited family up there. It was everyone's favorite place for breakfast, and I can't believe it's here!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. I especially love the grits! Everything else is great also! Friendly staff as always, at least for me. When I write a review, it usually has to be beyond my expectation or is really bad. And in this case I love this place."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast for the price. Our party of three all tried the two eggs any style with bacon or sausage and with coffee our bill came out around $25.  The food was decent, although my scrambled eggs were a little hard.  The link sausage was fine, not a ton of flavor.  Go for the bacon, it's thick and crispy, the big winner of the morning.  The coffee is also decent compared to most diner coffee. The pancakes were pretty thick and dense.  Maybe it was because we didn't order designer pancakes or scrambles but you should be able to be good at simple scrambled eggs if you tout all that other stuff."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast/brunch place! Clean, friendly and fast. The eggs Benedict was EXCELLENT. Waffles, and hash browns are very unique and gourmet. Great coffee. All around amazing!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. Staff incredible, food delicious. Back for my third time and it never disappoints.  The fresh squeezed OJ is wonderful. Usually get French toast but today it is a Sante fe scrambler with chorizo. Food quality and quantity is perfect. My favorite breakfast place yet. Have to try lunch one of these days."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time this morning! The decor is so neat! Modern but vintage I feel. I was with four other people and this is what we ordered! (We got tastes of everyones)
Veggie Omelet- they are huge! Loaded with veggies and very good! Love that you can pick your cheese! The hash brown are some of the best we have had! 
Cinnamon roll pancakes- AMAZING! My favorite thing!! So, so good! I would order them again and again for sure!
Belgium waffles with apples- waffle was crispy and the apples were warm and delicious! Very good
Blueberry pancakes- fresh fruit! It was so good!! We loved the pancakes!
Bacon onion and mushroom skillet- they definitely don't scrimp! Tons of meat and veggies! Eggs were cooked perfect and the potatoes so good again!! So impressed. 
Everything was just delicious, not to mention the fresh squeezed orange juice! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We stopped at Butterfield's during our family vacation. I had the Eggs Rojo and it was the best breakfast I've ever eaten. The combination of eggs, corn tortilla, black beans, jack cheese, and red New Mexico chile sauce was outstanding, and I could tell they use the freshest ingredients. Even the orange juice is fresh squeezed and amazing.

Also tried my brother's Oreo s'mores pancakes (heavenly), my girlfriend's pancakes (solid), and my mom's cinnamon roll pancakes (sweet and delicious).

Seems like you can't go wrong, no matter what you order. If I lived in the area, I would definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"My kids and I love the food.  We are always looking for a good breakfast and we got it here.  My only complaint is that they should have better coffee.  It is an average cup and for me excellent coffee is a must to keep me coming back consistently."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for a while and today I finally did and very happy. Unreal what all they have. Not just  eggs and pancakes. They have fruit crepes, 6 kinds of french toast including bannana nut bread french toast (YUM), egg scrambles, belgin waffels, and more. I had the biscuts and gravy which was good. The breakfast sausage you can get patties or links. Of course I got links and my god they were like 3 inches long and a 1 inch thick. They have thick cut bacon that was actually crispy not soggy and limp. The eggs benidict was freggin awesome! I will be back for this for sho. This place does breakfast realy good, but they are open till 3pm and they do lunch as well. I went there at 11am on a wed and there was a 15 min wait. I was suprised there was a wait that late in the morning but now I know why. This place rocks! Service was great. Everyone workin there was friendly and in good spirits. I cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. We got the Mexican Egg Burrito, Eggs Verde, and a side of cinnamon roll pancakes. Everything was perfect. The cinnamon roll pancakes were the best thing we've ever had. Service was wonderful and fast. Restaurant was clean and crisp. Can't wait to go back... Already dreaming about the next time I'll get to eat those pancakes"}
{"text":"As a Chicago native I've finally found a midwestern style breakfast place. Little did I know the first time I ate here that the owners really are from the Chicago suburbs. I have yet to find another breakfast place that compares to Butterfields. I've always had great food and service, plus I love the fresh orange juice. The portions are huge. The Good Egg which everyone seems to love just can't compare, nor can the chains. Butterfield's gets my vote for best breakfast. Just go early before the crowds get there. It tends to get noisy."}
{"text":"Was one of the breakfast joints I wanted to check out and see while I was in town for spring training. Was definitely a place to visit for good breakfast foods.  There was approximately a 15 minute wait which wasn't bad considering how many people were outside waiting to be seated.  I ended up ordering the California Scrambler which was really good but the pancakes are a must have!!!  My friend ended up ordering the buscuits and gravy which I wasn't a big fan of but while looking around to see what others got, everything looked amazing. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Just went to have breakfast at Butterfields and would recommend staying far away from this restaurant. A drink was spilled at the table and several of us took napkins from an adjoining table to wipe up the spill before a server could help us. The owner came over and reprimanded me for upsetting the table set up and wanted us to wait for a server to bring over extra napkins. He was very disrespectful and condescending to me when someone at out table called him out on this and asked if he could bring us more napkins he told our daughter to GET THE F___K OUT of his restaurant and he called the police on us. He was having a temper tantrum and his employees were apologizing for his behavior. I would not recommend going there to anyone ever. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. jm"}
{"text":"Still awesome, try the smoothies too!  The gluten free pancakes are awesome, you can ask for fruit and whipped cream on top too so you don't feel like you have to \"settle\" when you are a celiac!  Try the skillets, the chorizo skillet is fantastic, and so are their made to order omelets, that come with a side of pancakes!"}
{"text":"Yes, there will be await but worth it.  Once you are seated they take excellent care of you and the food was out amazingly fast and every bit of it was delicious, can't believe I ate the whole thing."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Fast service. They manage the flow in and out so well. The food is tasty with a great variety on the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast place I've been to in a long time. The atmosphere is like IHOP, if IHOP was cleaner, brighter, smelled better, and paid more attention to decorative details. My husband and I shared a veggie skillet and triple berry pancakes. I can't even describe the level of delectability. The skillet came out sizzling hot. The veggies tasted like they had been freshly diced in the kitchen. The eggs were perfectly over easy. The pancakes were light, fluffy, and absolute heaven to eat. And unlike many restaurants, when you order hot tea, you get two tea bags. My only regret was that I didn't have room in my stomach to try more menu items. Oh, well...there's always next time."}
{"text":"A 45 minute wait in 100 degree heat and totally worth it. Very professional staff made things easier. They told us 45 mins and that's what it was. Food came out quickly and we devoured it. Loved cinnamon bun pancakes, Nutella crepes and corned beef hash and eggs. Hope to get back soon!"}
{"text":"I thought that this place was ok. Nothing amazing as you would think from the amount of people flocking to the restaurant, but its reasonably priced and pretty good. I had the smoked salmon scramble and it was just ok. There were chunks of cream that didnt really get incorporated into the scramble and overall it was just okay. Definitely not something better than I could make at home. 

I guess that overall it is a solid place to grab some breakfast."}
{"text":"Butterfield's, as well as their sister restraunts Butter's are without a doubt the best breakfast spots in all of AZ. This bright and airy breakfast joint boasts incredible dishes made to order, coupled with freshly brewed coffee. It's most certainly the best cup in town. To cap it all off, the staff is nothing short of incredible.

Our server Annalee is always in top form with a warm and infectious smile. Her outstanding service is evident to the organization's customer centricity. 

I'm sure Butterfields will be serving up hot and amazing breakfast for generations to come."}
{"text":"Average pancake house with nothing to rave about. The eggs were good and so were the pancakes.  I would have loved to try the grits but they had none.  

Nothing to write home about - guess I am spoiled because we have stellar breakfast joints in suburban Chicago."}
{"text":"We got the wild berry pancakes and a side of hash browns.  Both were soooo good and unique! Staff is very attentive and their coffee is perfect too! Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"This place is my FAVORITE breakfast joint! I would probably frequent it more often but it's quite the drive for me. I could dream about their california scramble! My hubby loves the biscuits and gravy. I actually think it has more pepper than necessary. I think they're pancakes are amazing and even if you take them home and warm them up the next morning they hold their texture and taste! There is only one bad thing about this place: the staff is all 70lb teenage girls which can be annoying because they seem to be in quite the hurry to turn tables oh! and don't expect them to refill your coffee, water, or anything else once they've taken your payment. All that being said I crave their food it's by far the best breakfast I've had in AZ!"}
{"text":"If I'm not the first person to review a place, I usually try to add something to the to sum total of review knowledge provided. I'm not sure I'm actually doing that right now, but I really want to add my two cents about Butterfield's.

The menu is extensive, covering the ambit of breakfast food. I have trouble ordering as there are many things that look appetizing, but even when sticking with the basics, i.e. scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and pancakes, I leave smiling and full. The service has always been good and the food has always appeared quickly after ordering.

If you find yourself looking for \"a breakfast place\" this should be your destination."}
{"text":"We are hooked on Butterfield's! We go about once every month to six weeks. Would definitely go a lot more often if it wasn't 30 minutes away. We have had everything from the banana nut pancakes, cinnamon roll pancakes, Whole hog skillet, Wildberry crepes are amazing! Nothing to complain about. They're always busy and always have a wait but definitely worth it. Food is always out in a timely manner no matter how busy."}
{"text":"So, on the outside it looks like  a chain breakfast place like an IHOP or Dennys or something. But this place is great, quite a contrast from the chains. The staff is very attentive, the place is clean, and you can see that this place takes pride in everything. They have their own bottled syrup and their moto is \"Where breakfast is an all day affair.\" As it should be of course. 

They have a great menu of stuff. Some great pancakes, baked dutch and apple pancakes and some really creative french toasts. And that is just the beginning. There are egg dishes to no end. We ordered the baby apple pancake (baked, it takes 30 minutes) and an omelet (that comes with pancakes and hash browns). Everything was GREAT. If you have never had a baked dutch apple pancake, you should check it out!!!!! There are probably 3-4 apples in this thing and pretty much guaranteed that you will not eat it in one sitting, unless you share it. I had it for two days in a row (the same one, half each day). MMMMMMM!!! It was just great. The omelet was very good as well. My boyfriend ordered the bacon, avocado and cheese omelet. Everything was just perfect. 

The funny thing is, the service is almost too good. They filled the coffees so much, it was never cold and we kept having to add sugars and creamers. Our waitress took exceptional care of us, and I noticed that other tables were also well taken care of around us. I highly recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Shout out to our server Bronwyn! She was a delight in customer service, offering her recommendations, gluten-free suggestions and all w a huge smile on her face!  I appreciate the above and beyond attentiveness and thoughtfulness!  And the food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"Stop for breakfast on the way home from the airport. We had guests and all four of us really like the food here. They had a full breakfast menu and everything that we had was well prepared. The restaurant itself is clean, the Service people were all friendly and it would be a good place to go back to."}
{"text":"OMG pancakes!  The baked pancakes were worth the 30 mins wait.  My husband had the hog eggs and they were amazing too.  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with my family.  The restaurant was very busy, but somehow we got seated within 5 to 10 minutes.  This place would be getting a 5 star  review had it not been for the waitress forgetting things again and again.  In her defense, I really don't think she was forgetting some of the stuff and was just having difficulty getting our items due to the amount of people in the place.  We needed steamed milk and she kept saying the steamer was being used.  Same story with the smoothie.  Definitely not a big deal, though, and we loved all the food we had, which was very reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"Boy do I love a great Pancake house, and since I was visiting my friend in Scottsdale, she suggested we dine here. We dined a total of 3 days straight for breakfast, and each time I ordered something different for breakfast. This is a popular place for sure!
They do their best to keep your coffee cup filled at all times, and the orange juice is freshly squeezed with pulp in it. The toast is thick, which I really enjoy. The bacon is awesome and I would love to have it all of the time!

I believe they are open from 6:30 am to 2:30 pm and the lines and wait moves fairly quickly.

I loved the pancakes, again the batter is made fresh. The waffles were good too. The sausage benedict was ok and I wish I had tried something different. My friend loves the biscuits with gravy which is also fresh and tasty.

I will miss you Pancake house, but rest assured I will see  when I return to the area."}
{"text":"You know many places can not cook grits, let alone cheesy grits. Fabulous, I have too return just for those grits. Inside set up reminds me of the diners in NY. Coffee very good and they are always refilling your cup, oh and the fresh cream. Yum. I got the California scrambler with a side of the cheesy grits and pancakes. Not really a pancake person, but they were very good, along with their own syrup.  Yes two sides crazyyyyyyy. Hope they never change that, because next visit it will be two cheesy grits for my side. Lol. The scrambler was also excellent, took the balance of it home and one pancake. $13.50 without tip. All employees wonderful also."}
{"text":"The California Scrambler...wow! I'm talkin' holy shit wow!"}
{"text":"So much food for the price! Oreo pancakes are super unique and delicious. The omelettes are fluffy and amazing, and the hashbrowns are way cool. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast! I had orange juice, and the Santa Fe Scrambler with chicken sausage substituted for Chorizo. The orange juice was clearly freshly squeezed (I squeeze my own at home, so I can tell it's legit). The scrambler was piping hot and the egg to filling ratio was perfect. The staff never let my coffee mug drop below 1/3 full, so there's no complaints coming from me. Great place! 4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"one Word....EEEEWWWW!!!!

This place is like a nursing home cafeteria. The Food and the customers!

Being called a pancake house I thought that the pancakes would be good....instead I got old dry crumbly and cold cakes...... my omelet was more of a scramble and the eggs were browned and slimy... is that even possible?UGH!

I'll NEVER eat there again!! 

If there was a choice for no stars they'd be getting that.

And all I can say is anyone who thinks this place is great needs to quit drinking!"}
{"text":"we walked in at 2:45 on a sunday and they still seated and served us even though we came 15 mins before closing..so no waiting like a lot of the people were complaining about (of course you're going to wait, this restaurant is very popular..if you don't want a wait, go to dennys)...

like previous yelpers before me, we can all agree that the presentation and coffee are superb. the big pitcher of water was very helpful for my hangover...also, the bacon is super thick and probably the best bacon i've ever had...get it instead of the sausage!!!

i ordered the french toast (can't remember which one, i think it was blueberry), expecting a couple big, fluffy, pieces of french toast to arrive on my plate.

wrong.

what i got instead were 5 meager pieces of dry weird french toast about the size of a coaster each...VERY dissapointed, especially when my girlfriend ordered the chocolate chip banana pancakes and they were huge and fluffy and looked delicious...and tasted delicious...i tried to trade her but she refused..

if you're going to go here, don't get french toast! blah! it ruined butterfields for me and i'll probably never go back."}
{"text":"Very good food and I quote \"amazing hot chocolate\" 
I had a custom omelette with chorizo, ham, tomatoes, spinach and mushrooms. It was a little wet but tasty 
Table also ordered the beef hash and the chocolate chip pancakes 
Service was prompt, took a while to get drinks refilled 

Coffee was good if you like strong coffee (which seems to be the norm here in Scottsdale )!

Our bill came to $55"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and lives up to the hype. Wildberry in Chicago was phenomenal and this place held up it's end."}
{"text":"This is like an upscale Denny's because of the various sides you get with each breakfast/brunch plate; which is great because I like variety in my breakfast/brunch. I have had most of the scrambles and omelets, and all are terrific. The gluten-free pancakes are not the best but they're passable. The texture is off but the flavor is decent.

The wait can be long during traditional breakfast/brunch times on the weekend but if you get there before 9 am or after 12 pm the wait is short or nonexistent."}
{"text":"Overall a great breakfast place.  The food is very good.

Pro-tip: Had to wait 1 hour and 20 minutes for a 5 person table.  They have precious few tables for a party this size...best to go on a busy day with 4 or fewer, they turnover much more quickly."}
{"text":"The wait is actually reasonable for how busy the restaurant is. I could eat here every single day!!!! Best breakfast spot in Arizona."}
{"text":"We ordered the Mexicana Omelette and upgraded from toast to Banana Cream pancakes.  The jalape√±o cheese, and chorizo in the omelette were perfectly done.  Melty, unbelievably savory perfection.   My Banana Cream Cakes were served at butter melting temperature.  Those cakes were simply a breakfast dessert, and worthwhile!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite breakfast spot in any city I've visited! Thank you Yelpers for the recommendation!  

Service was excellent, with not only my waitress who took my order, but the whole staff was very friendly and checking to see if I needed coffee refills or anything.  The place was bright, very clean and open.

Irish Benny is pure genius! Two of my favorites: eggs benedict and corned beef hash, that had an added bonus - carmelized onion! Yum!

Hash browns are the traditional expectation but sliced and browned potatoes. Didn't eat much because I had to save room for the blueberry short stack that were light and fluffy with blueberries inside. Very good. 

Wish you were in L.A. I'd be there very often!!"}
{"text":"Great place, from Chicago we go to a place called wildberry and we were surprised to find out same owners. The pancakes are out of this world. Bit of a wait to get seated but well worth it. .your be hungrier and eat more pancakes. ....."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for some brunch and had the wildberry pancakes. They were the best pancakes I've ever had. They were soo fluffy and each bite just melted in my mouth. The white cream was a little to sweet for me though, next time I would get it without. I wish there was fruit actually cooked into the cakes, that'd make it 5 stars. I'm eager to come back and try some of the other food on the menu."}
{"text":"The service was very prompt and the food came out quick and perfect. I strongly suggest the Mexican omelet, mainly because the jalape√±o cheese will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Good crepes. Huge servings. There's always a line outside but the wait wasn't long. About 10 mins for 2 people."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. One of our family favourites. Although it can be quite busy. Be sure to plan ahead. Also lots of snow birds during the winter months. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is excellent and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!! Something for the kids , th parents. 5/5"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Coffee is very well done and the number of items on the menu to chose from fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is SERIOUSLY the best!  The service is spot on and every time we come the meals are incredible!  We've been all around for breakfast and this place always deliver.  The protein pancakes are a must  and I've settled into the Popeye scramble... for now!"}
{"text":"Best fresh-squeezed orange juice. Ever. It gets pretty busy (even in the Summer), but wait times are usually reasonable since the food comes out quickly and servers are attentive. Pancakes are good; omelettes are fluffy; always get the orange juice."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!! It's always busy & there's a wait, but the food is delicious & so worth it!!"}
{"text":"We stayed in Scottsdale for 8 days and went to Butterfield's twice (we also went to the other location Butters once) Yes, there is about a 20 minute wait but once you get seated, the service is super efficient and the food is great!  The owner, Danny, stopped to chat with us and recommended the Berry Pancakes, which were amazing!!  The pancakes were light and fluffy and surprisingly not too sweet, Danny said they use mascarpone cheese in the topping and let me tell you they were just delicious. The food is great quality and all of the servers are friendly and knowledgeable.  I would highly recommend Butterfield's and one of their other three locations, Butters."}
{"text":"Seems a tad overpriced for breakfast but the service is always great even though its almost always packed in there! The food is also consistently perfect."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for several years now and I have yet to be disappointed!! Their apple crepes will make you wanna slap yo' mama!! I just love this place!!"}
{"text":"Super busy on the weekends.  The wait moves very quick though. Kinda loud but not that bad. Great fresh squeezed OJ. Lots of menu choices. Everything looked good, I couldn't decide. Awesome bacon..and they always get the eggs just right. Service was pretty good. Id go back for sure"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, food is delicious and fresh! The prices are super friendly and competitive. Beware of high wait times on the weekends but other than that definitely beats IHOP or any other breakfast joint in town."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and friendly. My food arrived quickly.  It was exactly how I ordered it and was delicious."}
{"text":"I was recently in Scottsdale and ate here 3 mornings in a row. I can't think of anything they can improve on here. Delicious, well-cooked food and great service. Loved the coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, bacon (perfectly thick, chewy and crispy around edges), eggs cooked perfectly (had them both scrambled and over easy), fluffy pancakes and crispy hash browns. Even the butter that came with the toast and pancakes was soft and easy to spread. This place is just perfect. Wish they were in every city."}
{"text":"A chain restaurant or a local breakfast joint?? I couldn't figure it out the first time I went here. The design of the menu and restaurant is much like a chain restaurant, but with more vibrant colors and a certain energy to it. However, the service and food are indicative of a local, small town diner. 

There's nothing better than sitting down and already having your own pitcher full of fresh ice water w/lemon slices setting on your table! I love little touches like that! The coffee is always fresh and served with heavy cream - indulgent yes, worth it, absolutely!

The Blueberry Pancakes (with their delicious blueberry compote) are the best I've had. On a side note, if you get regular pancakes along with another meal, they'll give you a side of the blueberry compote free of charge. I highly recommend doing so! The Strawberry Shortcake Flapjacks are sweet and may make you feel like you've ordered dessert for breakfast, but it's ok to be naughty every once in a while. ;) The Classic Eggs Benedict (which I subbed regular bacon for the Canadian bacon it comes with) wasn't the best I've had, but  I give it an 8 out of 10! The hash browns have always been cooked perfectly - extra crispy!

I've never felt rushed at Butterfield's and I think that's rare for a busy breakfast place. The service is great all-around and the food is consistently satisfying. Yum! :)"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, my favorite breakfast place in metropolitan Phoenix! The service is always great and the food is just amazing. 

I made my boyfriend take me here today for my birthday and he was very skeptical. He ordered the New Mexico skillet and just about cried it was so good (he really likes food). We live about half an hour away and he agreed that we could come back every week. :) I always get the two egg breakfast and it never disappoints. Eggs like a cloud, life changing hash browns, and the best pancakes in town. 

Ask to be in Willy's section, he's awesome."}
{"text":"NOTE: Star-count is 3.799995 of 5.

This place wasn't bad at all, but I suppose I just got sucked into the hype of it all? I didn't have their hotcakes, waffles, or French Toast - I ordered their Mexican Breakfast Burrito - it was okay, I guess. Didn't under or overwhelm me, you know? 

Don't come here for the atmosphere or to have some sort of intimate conversation because you'll just be disappointed/pissed off. It is LOUD A.F. and babies/children everywhere (esp on weekends). DO come here for great service though! I asked for cream for my black coffee and before I could blink twice, I had a little serving in my grubby paws.

Perhaps one does need to order something packed w/carbs from there that wld require maple syrup as an accessory, but mehhh (shrugging shoulders)... it was aaiighht, I guess."}
{"text":"Is it trite to give this place 5 stars?   

Should I be contrarian and say this place sucks?

I... can't.   I just can't.  This place is hands-down the best breakfast place in the valley, and short of getting a $30 breakfast at a swanky resort, it isn't even close.   

I'll start by saying that when you order coffee, they bring you REAL CREAM for it.   Do you know how long it's been since I've seen a breakfast place bring me real cream?  So long that I had to check to make sure it wasn't spoiled half & half.  It makes their already good coffee taste awesome.  

Next, they have actual thick cut bacon, not the pre-packaged strips you'll find at Denny's..  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  

Everything I've had off their griddle (french toast, belgian waffles, crepes) have been awesome.  If you get the chance and you're hankering something sweet, get their taffy apple french toast.  I think they put me in a sugar coma, but it's soooo good.  Tons of apples, caramel, pecans, other things I don't really remember cause I kinda blacked out.  Oddly enough, though I haven't had them myself, I've heard the pancakes were less than spectacular- crumbly and overdone was the description a friend gave  Strange for what would seem to be their signature dish.  I'll chalk it up to a one-time error.  

Also, can anyone explain why I find the need to order eggs for breakfast?  For some reason, it just doesn't feel like a breakfast meal unless there are eggs present, but I only ever eat like half of them.   I don't even really like them.  That's not really related to the review, just kinda throwing it out there."}
{"text":"yay im a fan! not a groupie... but not a hater by any means.

they were PACKED on sunday around noon. there were people hanging around out front waiting to be seated. there were two of us and they told us we'd be waiting for 30 minutes. we said thats cool and wanted a coffee while we waited so the guy asked us how we take our coffee and he actually pre mixed it and brought it to us in tiny styrofoam cups. this was very weird. i like to mix my own coffee milk and sugar. the total was 4:90 for the two tiny coffees and they had to charge us there and not just add it to the bill. weird. 

but the food was great and the wait time wasnt nearly 30 minutes and they brought whatever we asked for. 

oh, fyi... dont get the big french toast. first of all its waaaay too big. and second of all its waaay too eggy. just fluffy and eggy and not very worth it."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience! I will definitely share my meal next time. So much food....yay! And, these were truly the fluffiest eggs I have EVER had. Only a 5 minute wait to be seated. Our server was excellent, professional, attentive and super sweet. We will be back after I recover! :-)"}
{"text":"I went to their Northbrook, IL location many, MANY years ago with my dad for pancakes.  I recall that the pancakes were good.  Tried the Scottsdale location today.  They were packed, but we were seated within 5 minutes.  Service was extremely fast.  After being seated, the waitress took our order within 3 minutes and the food arrived within 7-10 minutes.  Portions were very small--not at all what I remembered from Chicago.  The wife had the spinach & gruyere crepe--not all that bad, but nothing all that great either.  I had the Southern Benedict.  Very, very small.  Everything tasted processed.  The grits were more of a paste--not home-made.  The steel-cut Scottish oatmeal was not made from steel-cut oats.  Final damages--$27 for two, so not so bad.  Both of us got sick on the way home.  Won't be going back.  I can see it is very popular (as are the Chicago locations) but I don't want to pay for reconstituted Restaurant Depot meals.  Hopefuly, their famous pancakes aren't of the same quality, but we're not going back to find out."}
{"text":"This is THE spot for a great breakfast in Scottsdale. My wife and I have yet to be disappointed and love coming here any time we are in the neighborhood. Keep in mind that this place is a \"snow bird\" hot spot during the winter months and the wait can run quite long. Their Shea location was also just remodeled last year (or so) bringing a fresh and more modern feel. 

My wife pretty regularly orders her ultimate favorite: the Swedish Pancakes. I don't like any type of pancake so I don't get the attraction, but she raaaaaaaaves about them. They are very thin and cooked well with a Lingonberry sauce on top.

My standard Turkey Club sandwich never disappoints. Buttered and toasted wheat bread, cheddar cheese, thick cut bacon, quality sliced turkey, lettuce, tomato and mayo. I've yet to have the French fries because every time I ask for them to sub their out of this world hash browns. They freshly slice their potatoes and cook them up with tons of crunchy hash brown goodness mixed throughout. Never need to ask for them well done here ;-).

This place is soooo far above the usual breakfast chain joints in terms of quality, you can't even compare them. They are in a tier all their own and I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Got their Sunday and we had a half hour wait. 25 minutes later we were seated. Placed was Packed. I was prepared to wait an addnl half hour for  our food because of it. Surprised 15 minutes later Fiod came out Hot. Wife got California Omelette I tried it it was really good. Kids got silver dollar cakes and French toast.  Bacon was excellent. I got Mexican Skillet and I like it. I will definitely go back and try other things.  Great food. Great Service. Well done."}
{"text":"Very poor training for host staff. Bad policies for seating larger parties. Absent management. 

Butterfield's refused to make a reservation for 11 am on a Tuesday for our party of eight.(Our group of 10 or so meets for lunch every Tuesday and spend about $15 pp.) When five of us arrived at 11 am promptly, four of us were seated in a booth, while the remainder of the party was given a pager. We were told to let the \"host staff\" know when the others arrived and we would be seated.  Our party was complete less than 5 minutes later. We were then put on the bottom of the wait list. Tick... tick... tick.  Empty booths near the first half of our party were filled.  Tick... tick... tick. We made several inquiries to the host staff.  Tick... tick... tick. Our first four had coffee and juice at the table and we remained standing. Tick... tick... tick. At 11:20 we walked out of Butterfield's in favor of Eggstacy - just down the street - where we were welcomed warmly, seated immediately, and had a lovely lunch. Butterfield's is off our list!"}
{"text":"I heard of this place from a few of my friends and I know a couple girls who work here so I had to check it out. 

After learning that they have fresh squeezed ruby red grapefruit juice I knew I was going to be a fan. Not only the juice, the latte was good and the protein pancakes were amazing as well. 

The food was fresh, good and service was very good. There was an army of staff working hard to keep everyone happy. I have many people come by my table for refills on water, with food and to ask how everything was. 

Will have to make this one of my spots for breakfast when in the area for sure!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots! I love the variety of their menu. I usually stick with the eggs special so I can order both sweet and savory items. The Nutella crepes are yummy, but I didn't like the scrambler I ordered. Too much stuff all mixed together. I like that I was able to substitute whatever flavor of pancakes I wanted for no extra charge. Chocolate chips ftw! Service is always great and make sure you make reservations otherwise you'll be waiting for 40 minutes like we did one day."}
{"text":"Good food. Each of us got something different including pecan waffle, Santa Fe scrambler, and cheese blintzes. Ample servings. . Not a long wait."}
{"text":"Good place, service was fast even though there was a line out the door. They do a great job of moving people in and out and the food came out really quick. 

Coffee was an average cup which was disappointing for the price but it was always full from all the staff members. 

Had the skillet which was good, could of used a few more flavors but wasn't bad, grits were really good and fresh! Pancakes were delicious. 

I'm big on customer service! Staff worked very well together to aid each other and  all the tables! Bussers, servers and management seemed to work really well together to fill drinks, clear tables and make it a good experience. 
Will recommend to come back again!"}
{"text":"So glad we found you on yelp. When we pulled up and seen the huge line of people waiting I thought the wait would be over 1 hour and was surprised when the hostess said 20-30 minutes and they will call my cell phone when our table is ready. Not only did they call but they also sent a text which was great because we opted to sit in our car.
I am not really a OJ drinker but because of yelp thought I had to give it a try and ordered a small glass. I wish I could have ordered a gallon to go- it was the best OJ I have ever tried.
I had the pecan waffle with sliced bananas and yes they put the toasted pecans in the batter-don't know why but it really tastes better in the batter. Husband had the skillet breakfast and he said it was good.
Our waitress was great and told us the owners were from the Chicago area ( we are also), though we had never heard of Butterfields. She also told us about the Butters cafe locations which was closer to our hotel so we went to Butters Cafe the next day. And yes it was even better. 
Please, Please open in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I biked all over the Phoenix area looking for authentic eggs Benedict and this is the place for it. Waffes and pancakes better than average as well, but helloooo, Scottsdale, right? If you want your Eggs Benny, NY Style. This is the place. Gets very busy after 8 am so come early. Oh and they freshly squeeze ALL their juices so do not skip the Vitamin C dose."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. The wait was 30 minutes, but we got called within 20 minutes. However, when we got to the reception desk we were told to wait by the side and waited another 10 minutes. No big deal just expected to be seated when we were called."}
{"text":"I like this place mostly because my wife can eat well here. She has many many food allergies and if you know how hard it can be to eat out. They let her replace many items and you can upgrade for small charges too. The food is very good and fresh. I am not that much of a breakfast eater but find they do offer plenty of lunch items that are great too. Yes there is a good chance you will wait a bit but for us it is worth it."}
{"text":"Just a great staple breakfast joint.  Service is always good and fast.  Try some of the specialty pancakes, we liked the cinnamon roll; not super sweet and flavorful.  Baked potato omelet is my favorite."}
{"text":"More of a 3.5 needed to take account for the other dishes my hubby n friend ordered..for what I ordered it was a solid 4 stars

Pro: wide range menu..special Pancakes, Waffles, and crepes (ordered the Oreo Pancake which maybe too sweet for some but knowing it was covered with melted marshmallows. I was expecting it :)..coffee strong and Good, Service excellent, scramble with lox, eggs were really fluffy!! Can switch sides and upgrade pancake to a speciality version for a $1 xtra

Con: wait (long especially on weekends) , the corn beef hash had more potatoes then actual corn beef"}
{"text":"After hearing for years that this is Theeee Best Breakfast in town I finally checked it out.  Now I've been twice, and I just don't get it.  I just found NOTHING special about this place at all.  It's a cute breakfast dinner and the pancakes and waffles are ... well, pancakes and waffles.

Both times I've been we had to wait to be seated, and both times I didn't feel it was worth it.

In my opinion Palette, Over Easy and Matt's Big Breakfast are so much better.  Of course your mileage may vary."}
{"text":"Love this place, have been there several times since moving back to this area! The pancakes are super light and fluffy with just a bit of crisp to them. I am particularly fond of their Mexicana omelet which is packed full of chorizo, onions and cheese and topped with a fantastic green chile sauce. I've only eaten breakfast when we've gone but my husband has had their bacon cheeseburger and said it is one of the better ones in the area."}
{"text":"It's worth the wait! Favorite place in town for breakfast. Hand squeezed OJ, great banana smoothie and the berry bliss pancakes are the best Pancakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, really good coffee and it's remodeled really nice. Orange juice is fresh squeezed!! So delicious! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Good Lord. I am officially obsessed with this place. Hubby and I started a tradition of coming here after our monthly morning obstetrician appointments. I have always wanted to try this place but it is kind of far from our house and I hate long waits on the weekends. This place is nearby our obstetrician's office and we go on weekdays, so it isn't so bad. It still gets pretty busy on the weekdays but no horrendous wait.

The omelettes are to die for. They are so incredibly fluffy and tasty. The home fries are unique, seasoned perfectly, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. 

I would recommend getting the pancakes as your bread side to your egg dish. You can upgrade to their specialty pancakes for a couple more bucks. I'm picky with pancakes but these are sublime. 

Service is always very friendly, never had a problem.

I guess it is a good thing Butterfields is too far from our house to be going on a regular basis. I would be going all the time and packing on the pounds!!"}
{"text":"First things first. If you go on a weekend, there will be a wait. Just chill. The wait is well worth it and they move through the waiting list really pretty quick. Our projected 25 minute wait time on Saturday at 11 AM was more like 15 minutes. 
We sat in a booth which was very comfortable. Not one of those booths that feel like you're dropping into the Grand Canyon. Restrooms are spotless. The hostess & wait staff are very friendly, engaging and helpful. 
The food. 
I had the Santa Fe skillet. Fantastic! The chorizo was well seasoned but not overpowering. The onions & avocados were very fresh and tasty. The bed of hashbrowns were perfectly crispy. My wife had the California scramble. Actual quote: \"these are the FLUFFIEST eggs I've ever had!\" Cathy, our server, was very nice and helpful. 
One more tip, they give plenty of food. We both took home 1/3 of the meal.
I'd be interested in going back to try their lunch fare."}
{"text":"Am sitting here now for breakfast and was suggested I come here from CoffeeBean lady just south of here. Pretty good waffle and syrup. Bacon was good. Grits were creamed and yuk. Eggs good. I couldn't eat much of fried potatoes, grits and egg mix. Mostly because of the dang cream grits. Otherwise all was good."}
{"text":"I have been to Butters before and heard that this place is their sister restaurant. I had high hopes that it would be as good, but it was possibly even better! It's a larger venue, so the wait time is a lot less. They also have a bunch of two seater booths, which is really great if you have a small party.

I came here with my son and got a skillet and a side of wild berry bliss pancakes with a mocha latte. My son got the Oreo pancakes. Holy wow. All of it was so freaking good. Those pancakes are so perfect and amazing. I'm sure they would be delicious plain, but the wild berry bliss are next level. I've never had better pancakes in my entire life.

I don't like waiting too long at restaurants, but I'd happily wait a stupidly long time to dine here. Butters and Butterfield's, I love you so."}
{"text":"Excellent service and breakfast. I found that their coffee was superior to most breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE? If you're like me, and have no choice but to be gluten-free, then you're tired of always seeing upcharges on the bill for substituted items. Hey, it might seem unfair, but I'm sure it costs a little extra for gluten free ingredients and special handling. The frustrating thing is when they make extra money on those ingredients and handling. Even more frustrating is seeing those upcharges on your bill even though you asked the server if there were any, and were told there weren't. 
Sunday was our third visit to Butterfield's (or Butter's) in three years. Of course the gluten free pancakes cost a little more, but I'm happy to pay it for GF food. I specifically asked the server, Sidney, if there were any upcharges for GF pancakes at all. She said no. Then immediately after answering that question said that the table syrup wasn't GF, and asked if I wanted GF (knowing 5 seconds prior we'd been discussing upcharges for GF orders). Well sure! In my mind pancakes are just a delivery system for the syrup. 
She brought four pancakes and a little tiny container of syrup, maybe enough for one pancake. I asked for another one. After pouring them both, it was obvious that it would take two more, but I decided not to bother her again. When the bill came, each of those small GF syrups was $2. So there was an extra $4 for syrup. If I'd have asked for two more, the cost of the syrup would have exceeded the cost of the pancakes. There's absolutely no way that they weren't at least doubling the cost of the syrup. And wait, didn't I ask the server about upcharges? But that's not the only reason we won't eat there anymore. It seems that every time we eat there, I suffer from Celiac symptoms the next day. I can't believe that they aren't trying very hard to keep gluten out of the food, but it's the only thing I ate each time that I didn't fix myself that day. Look, the server showed a level of trustworthiness that I'm not comfortable with. Was that her decision, or is it an informal policy recommended by someone above her? I don't know. But now that doubt is in my mind, and I don't want to put my trust in a restaurant I have doubts about. 
If you aren't required to be GF, and have no reason to expect unreasonable upcharges, then you'll like the atmosphere, that they serve breakfast well into the afternoon, and that the servers are friendly (if not completely upfront)."}
{"text":"Our fave breakfast place in the valley!  I've never had anything I didn't love. Smoked salmon omelette is so good and I love their buttermilk pancakes, no matter what kind. Their cinnamon roll ones are so amazing. I love the coffee and fast service. I wish it didn't take so long to get seated!"}
{"text":"This  is seriously my new fave breakfast place.  My wife and youngest daughter checked it out and we were blown away by the quality of food and service! We got the Mexicana omelet and it was the Bomb! The banana pancakes were to die for! The Butterfields syrup was so delicious too. Our waiter was Rafael and he was fast, courteous and informative. We are going to return with my oldest daughter this weekend!"}
{"text":"The French Toast is borderline orgasmic.

The orange juice is fantastic, but expensive.

Service is very good.

Overall, a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning; and while we had a fun meal, I'm not sure I feel the need to come rushing back.  We arrived at 9:15 and were given a 30 minute wait (for a party of two).  My Eggs Benedict were overcooked (after having a discussion with our waitress specifically about wanting the yolks still a bit runny and being assured they were... they weren't) and my friend's Apple French Toast was good-- not too sweet-- but not phenomenal.  

Like the stars say, it was \"A-ok,\" just not necessarily more than that.  Worth a visit if you're so inclined.  Maybe you'll have better luck.  I'm not sure why a place so average had a line out the door... maybe I'm missing something?"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict were beautifully presented with crispy hash browns. The wait person let the manager know I really wanted crispy hash browns. They delivered!  He came and spoke to me personally about their technique for consistent quality. It was nice to have a wait person smile every time she came to the table."}
{"text":"This last Sunday, my wife took me for breakfast and I chose Butterfields. Staff said there was about a 30 minute wait and that was how long we waited.
Our server Shawna was on queue, greeted us
and asked what we wanted to drink. 
The staff was efficient, cleared our table, made sure we had enough coffee, asked if thete was anything else we needed and we never felt rushed.
I had the omelette with jack cheese, sausage  and mushrooms with pancakes. My wife enjoyed her Swedish pancakes. Everything was excellent.
Enjoyed our Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"This is definitely our new favorite breakfast spot! We got the skillets, crepes, and a side of pancakes. The eggs were the fluffiness ones I've ever had and the crepes were delicious. It was crowded when we went, (around 12 on a Saturday) but we were seated quickly and the service was great."}
{"text":"Yummy, giant portions!

I came here on the recommendation of a fellow Yelper. We came late (around 1pm) so the wait was only about 20 minutes for 2 people. Unfortunately, this also meant they were out of the apple pancake. 

We decided to order the strawberry pancakes and the smoked salmon scramble only to discover....the smoked salmon scramble comes with hash browns or fruit AND a side of pancakes! For an extra $1.50, you can upgrade from regular to specialty pancakes so we upgraded to strawberry. Since we got everything we originally wanted there, we decided to order the cheese blintz crepes with wildberries.

The smoked salmon scramble and the strawberry pancakes were both great! The pancakes were definitely next level fluffy and a side order of 2 was just right and not too much. The scramble was also perfectly fluffy and the cream cheese inside was perfect. 

The crepes were also good (though not as delicious) but honestly, we were so full from the first entree, we weren't able to finish this dish.

The prices here are fair, the service is friendly, the menu is vast, portions huge and scrambles and pancakes are delicious: what's not to like?! I wish we had this place in California!"}
{"text":"There's something about this place that is so yummy for breakfast. Something that makes it stand out. Obviously yummy food.  Great customer service.  And pretty quick wait and getting your food even if it looks really crowded. Love their crepes.  Their side of fruit is impressive.  Berries and not the awful melons you normally get. Good all around place. And yes, fresh oj."}
{"text":"BRAVO Butterfield's!  I am definitely a breakfast person and this HIT THE SPOT!  Great Coffee and FRESH Squeezed OJ to Start your morning..... I had the FLUFFIEST and TASTIEST OMLETE MADE! Mexicana Omelete - Chorizo sausage, avocado, onion & your choice of cheese (I chose Jack). Smothered in their new mexico green chile sauce.   Worth a TRIP!  FRESH! FRESH! FRESH!"}
{"text":"Everything was great. Food and service 

We had the banana cream pancakes and the Oreo smores pancakes plus eggs and bacon 

Come early to avoid the wait! But amazing and everyone should try it"}
{"text":"Baked potato omelet....order it!!! You won't be disappointed. We found this place on yelp so I looked up the menu. I saw that omelet and was intrigued. Best omelet I've ever had! The restaurant is huge and service is quick. I wish we lived closer!!!"}
{"text":"We went around 9:45am on a Sunday morning... oops? 30 minute wait, but definitely worth it. Fantastic food, even if you don't get the pancakes. Our server was on the ball, refilled my coffee cup 3 times without me asking, and was clearly working hard, taking care of all the other tables in her section. I got the smoked salmon scramble and it was perfect. The bathroom was clean, which is always important to me. The only thing that didn't make it perfect was the three ladies at the hostess counter. Not exactly a personable bunch!"}
{"text":"We were hungry after flying clear across the USA from Chattanooga, TN as flight crew.  And Butterfields was one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time.  The omelet was so light & fluffy and filled with goodies!  Melt in your mouth!  Coffee was outstanding flavor.  Hashbrowns with extra onions made just as I ordered.  YUM!"}
{"text":"The best place to go for breakfast PLUS they have fresh O.J!

{"text":"OK I'm not a big breakfast person!  In fact I never go out to eat for breakfast!  But I have been forced to go out to eat at an ungodly early hour at Butterfields and they are a breath of fresh classy air for breakfast restaurants in the area. 

So as I mentioned I am not a morning/ breakfast person. Once when I was dragged here with the early rising hungry freakish friends I ordered a granola yogurt and fruit sundae and lots of coffee. The sundae was huge fresh and my friends who were initially disappointed with my choice were way jealous! 

Now my friends obviously tend to order more filling and typical breakfast dishes and they LOVE this place. I can see why! Their food always looks freshly prepared and delicious. Another impressive thing about Butterfields is the prices. As I mentioned the food is good quality, the portions are huge, and the prices are about the same as  IHOP'S and Denny's."}
{"text":"Finally was able to dine here after YEARS of bookmarking this place.  I first heard of Butterfield's while living in IL-- do you know that Butterfield's may only be found in TWO U.S. states?  One location in Scottsdale, AZ, and four locations in IL!  Butterfield's \"recently\" had another baby addition to the family called Butters, which may be found on Northsight and Raintree off of the 101.  (The first Butters is on E. Via de Ventura.  Pretty much the same menu as Butterfield's EXCEPT you won't find the Baby Apple, the Dutch Baby, the Crispy Chicken Fingers platter, nor the Crispy Chicken Salad at Butters.)

I came in here once many years ago and determined that I could not do ANY of the specialty pancakes due to the presence of powdered sugar and/or corn syrup in the toppings/glazes/sauces.  However, after making a phone call to Butterfield's yesterday, I found out that the Baby Apple is FREE of corn syrup and powdered sugar!  The apple filling consists of apples, sugar, butter, and cinnamon- that's it!  One very important thing to note is that both Baby Apple and Dutch Baby require 30 minutes to cook, and I've already asked... you may call in your order so as to cut down your waiting time when you arrive at the restaurant.  I didn't call my order in ahead, though.

For a 10 am seating on a Wednesday morning, Butterfield's was busy, but Mom and I did not have to wait at all for a booth, and coffee and water service was delivered just a few minutes after we sat down- sweet!  Another thing to note about Butterfield's is you will NOT need to flag someone down for fresh coffee!  A rough count of how many times I had coffee topped off is four, and multiple servers must've stopped at our table AT LEAST ten times.  I don't mind the interruptions, though.  I'd rather have them ask/stop by too much than too little, or not at all.

I originally wanted to just wait for my Baby Apple to arrive, but since Mom's Taffy Apple French toast wasn't going to take 30 minutes, I decided to put in an order for Two Eggs ($7), which also comes with crispy hash browns and choice of pancakes or toast.  Mom wanted bacon (so did I), and a side of bacon with the eggs costs $2.50. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfields-pancake-house-scottsdale?select=tXZNOcBEb97ptGeOQW-PGA  Lovely entree--we both enjoyed the hash browns' crispiness (they're smashed rather than shredded), and the three strips of bacon were delightful, as well.  Oh, and the pancakes are a must!  I'm impressed. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfields-pancake-house-scottsdale?select=JFblrAuCUEY6qYjvJardgw  I had to pay an extra $2 for pure maple syrup here.  I didn't mind paying the extra charge, but I DID mind that the syrup came in a foil-capped plastic container.  I'd rather have a refillable bottle like those I've encountered elsewhere at similar prices.

Mom would not order the Taffy Apple again. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfields-pancake-house-scottsdale?select=f2SEY0zO4grlpZCYTxZX7Q  I was surprised that the caramel and apples weren't sweet enough for her; she had to add Butterfield's own blend of maple and corn syrups.  I couldn't try her French toast, since I did not specify \"no powdered sugar.\"  She said she'd wished she'd just ordered the plain brioche...  

Would like to return again to try other egg dishes, and to enjoy the bright interior, upbeat service, and constant coffee refills!  (Oh, and you may take a cup of coffee to-go, if you need any more-- I did not!)

Oh, and what about that Baby Apple? https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/butterfields-pancake-house-scottsdale?select=Wa1lq5MVpDGmKHgRShRHVA  It was SO sweet!  I'll have to try it again as a snack either later today, or tomorrow and update my review.

---

The Baby Apple is best eaten at the restaurant.  Refrigeration altered the texture of the flaky pancake to something I'm not too keen about (but the flaky, fluffy layers were lovely fresh-from-the-oven!  Also, I wish there were more apple pieces.  I did have a couple of thin slices that Wednesday morning, and after consuming 1/4 of the pancake yesterday, and a quarter today, I finally stumbled onto half of a slice today!  Curious as to what tomorrow's quarter will bring...  ;)"}
{"text":"Good variety of food - never really had a bad experience with food or service. It has become a sentimental family favorite. The waits on the weekend can be long, but not bad if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Butterfield's and I cannot believe I waited this long to eat here. I passed it twice a day and the name sounds delicious I have just never got around to stopping here .this morning I ordered the potato omelette and the cinnamon roll pancakes and I don't think that I have ever had a better breakfast then I just had right now .the cinnamon roll pancakes are absolutely amazing. I put the first bite in my mouth and I literally paused out of shock of how good the pancakes . I'm not just saying that they were freaking amazing. I cannot wait to bring my husband here. Also the Ice-T  was delicious and the service was great. Everybody was friendly."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to Butterfield's every time I visit Arizona. I actually come for breakfast at least three times a week here. The food is delicious, especially the OJ which is freshly squeezed by their amazing juicer. I have never been disappointed dinning here and the waitress/waiters are super nice."}
{"text":"As I'm sitting here waiting for a table, I'm at awe as to how quickly tables are turned over as soon as a customer leaves. These guys don't waste any time bringing in new customers to eat their delicious food!
We just recently tried their oven baked pancakes. All I can say is oh my!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was very good.  Get there early cause it gets packed quick. It was around lunch and it was still an hour wait.

Clean restaurant.  Very well kept and this is a must since the location is in Scottsdale/Paradise Valley.

Prices are like any other breakfast and lunch place.  I got the Chorizo Burrito, wifey got the Corned Beef and Hash, son got the Country Benedict, and the girl gets pancakes topped with Oreos.  I also started with a freshly squeezed large OJ.  Good stuff.

Chorizo is usually overpowering but the amount was just right.  I could actually taste the egg, cheese, and veggies that were also in the burrito.  The side of potatoes that came with the dish was excellent.  I had a bite of the corned beef and hash and that was very good too.  

Servers were very nice and the food came out in a timely manner.  If I lived closer, I definitely would go here more often."}
{"text":"Solid food and service.  You may have to wait to get a table. Very popular."}
{"text":"Wow! That was a serious carb loading breakfast ! Met some friends & had berry pancakes , New Mexico skillet and California scramble . Everyone loved their dishes ! Side of fruit was a delicious mix of blueberries , strawberries and blackberries . The fresh orange and tomato juice , very good . This spot was jam packed , jelly tight ! Although every table was full the wait was only 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here. Great breakfast fare. Great prices. Great service. The pancakes are really good. I still wonder why people go to Dennys.  This is wayyyyyy better."}
{"text":"I've been to this place at least 20 times and I am now just writing a review?!

Butterfield's is hands down, the best breakfast place I have ever been too.  Their food is always so fresh with so many delicious choices.  If you get a chance be sure to try their cinnamon swirl pancakes.  Had them and was blown away. 

I bit of advice is to either be early or eat at their off times.  Butterfield's is known for good food and also long waits.  On a Sat/Sun morning, you could drive by and easily see 40-50 people waiting outside (and that's just outside!).

Honestly, it is well worth the wait.  Staff is great and service is quick."}
{"text":"I came here on the last day of a girls trip. We wanted a good breakfast place that we could go and just veg for a while. Butterfield's reviews were quite good so we gave it a shot. It's a solid place for breakfast. The service was quick, it reminds me of a better quality ihop. The pancakes were so good and so were the french toast. The service was friendly and we were not rushed. Overall, I would definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Butterfields is amazing!!!! Someone compared it to IHop??? No where near IHop, it is greasy and dirty people go there for a value meal, huge greasy omelet with pancakes.. ugh.. a heart attack. Butterfields is a great environment and atmosphere with waffles on the ceiling, great neighborhood and the food, ohh the food. Try the California Scramble, its absolutely delightful, and thier whole wheat toast, WOW@ Coffee is amazing and service is fantastic. yes there is usually a long wait to be seated. But this isn't McDonalds!!!! Its a great food joint! You want super fast service go to IHOP McDonalds, Burger King, you want great delicious food and lower in fat and calories, GO TO BUTTERFIELDS!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot because everything on the menu is absolutely sensational!! Not only is the food delicious (and consistently so!) But their coffee, every single time, is beyond anything I've ever had. Strong, robust flavor that doesn't get lost when I add heavy cream. Simply amazing.
The wait can seem pretty daunting at first, but the service is quick without that feeling like you're being rushed.
It's a very clean environment and the customer service is nothing short of amazing. Add that on top of excellent food and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal Breakfast!!!
  Our first visit this morning, 25 minute wait (on a Sunday morning- NOT BAD!)  We pulled up and people were mingling patiently inside and outside waiting for tables.
  When it was our turn to sit, we were welcomed by a very cheery waitress who got our drinks immediately.  The atmoshphere was very clean and friendly.  The fresh-squeezed orange juice machine near the kitchen double doors was a subtle reminder of the fresh quality of our food to come.
Our dishes came in a very timely manner, piping hot and delicious - mine was the best California Scramble and Fluffy banana pancakes EVER!  Paired with a carefully prepared mocha, complete with a delicate chocolate syrup swirl on top.  
 I work in the property management industry in a large community in the area and had to run off to work right after breakfast.  I have already recommended Buterfield's to several residents today!    
This place will be a regular hot spot for our young family, and most likely a new weekend tradition!  :-)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Scottsdale for breakfast.  Service is extremely fast.  My waffle appeared in less than 5 minutes.  If you come on a weekend, be prepared for a long wait."}
{"text":"Great service and great food make this a win/win.  First time trying this place and very happy and will be back for sure. We are breakfast people and this hit the spot.  Come try it yourself to see!!!"}
{"text":"Solid brunch for 10, quick service and good food."}
{"text":"I've only visited this place twice because of how far away it is from where I live. BUT OOOOOO if I lived closer then I'd be I trouble!! I love this place because the food is delicious, the coffee tastes great, the staff is friendly and observing. They're on point with the refills! This place gets pretty crowded on the weekends but it seems to take about 25 minutes to seat you on its busiest days. It's also a very clean place. I happened to run into a celebrity (Evelyn Lozada) here once. If celebrities are eating here then you know it has to be good! Right?! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A few things sum this up, fluffy amazing specialty pancakes, fluffy cloud scrambled eggs, classic fresh OJ, and grits. By far in my top 3 best places to eat in Phoenix. Stop reading this and go get yourself some!"}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to go here the first week we moved here just over 3 years ago. Since that first time we have kept coming back even though we have moved further away. The service is also fantastic. The food is so good and there is a great selection. 

The only downfall would have to be the wait some times. If you try to avoid the Sat and Sun 9am rush then you will be good. They are extremely good at getting people in and out so even if you have to wait you can see that your turn is coming."}
{"text":"We made the drive up to North Scottsdale to try out Butterfield's, and left satisfied.  In addition to more sweet items such as pancakes, French toast, Belgian waffles, and crepes, they also offer savory breakfasts such as skillets, omelettes, and scrambles.  The ingredients are very high quality, and they take a lot of care to make a great tasting meal for you.

Feeling like I was in a caffeine deficit, I decided to try out the caramel macchiato (A little over $4, can be made iced or hot).  It was a nice blend of sweetness and creaminess, and the coffee itself was very smooth.  The coffee drinks are served as a 16 oz. size, so although they are pricey, you get a good amount of drink for your money.

After poring through the extensive menu, I decided on the wildberry pancakes ($8.95).  They were moist, fluffy, with a nice selection of fresh berries (Blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries) on the side.  Sandwiched in-between the pancakes were a mix of blueberries and a berry-mascarpone filling.  The pancakes were also coated with a lovely drizzle of vanilla cream (Made with real vanilla bean) and berry sauce.  There was enough sweetness and creaminess in the dish that I didn't need to add any syrup at all, nor add any of the butter that was included as a side.  The only thing I didn't really like was that there was a small amount of the mascarpone filling, and since there was just a smattering of it, it tasted like hot cream cheese inside the hot pancakes (Not very appealing to me at least since you usually associate mascarpone/sweet cream fillings with cold temperature).

My friend had an egg-white omelette, which was quite possibly the fluffiest egg-white omelette I've seen, and quite fluffy compared to normal omelettes I've seen!  I had a taste, and it was really well-executed.  The flavors inside the omelette were perfect.  I also tried some of the chorizo skillet, which was a very good portion, with hearty amounts of chorizo, veggie, cheese, and potato.

We came here on a Sunday around 10 A.M. and waited about 20-25 minutes for 3 people.  Service was friendly and fast despite the busy atmosphere.  Butterfield's is definitely one of the top breakfast places to go if you don't mind the wait!"}
{"text":"Service was good, bacon was great, hash browns were awesome, but the pancakes that they stake their name on were all very dry. Not to mention OVER FIVE DOLLARS for a single glass of orange juice with no refills. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday morning around 11:30...the place was very crowded and loud. I really wanted to order the German pancake...but the 30 minute wait was a little too much!! Other than that the service was quick and courteous. I ordered the Berry Crepes which were very good. Fresh berries and mascarpone filling. On the sweet side but very good. My mom had the Ruben sandwich. It was also good. Probably not the best in the valley...I would stick to breakfast. The pancakes and French toast I saw coming out of the kitchen looked great!"}
{"text":"Oh the smell of pancakes hit me right when I got off the car.  Frying butter so sweet hit my nostrils and took my brain captive. An image of mouthwatering fluffiness of heaven and deliciousness over came me. I slide into the booth and waited patiently for the stack of heaven to be pushed in front of me. I reached for warm syrup and begun to slather these thick, fluffy, scrumptious, delightful, pancakes....I eagerly  cut off a bite and lifted it toward my mouth. No disappointments.  The sweetness of the syrup, right behind it was the melted butter, and the crunchy pecans. Each complemented one another with perfection. Syrup cascades down my chin and I go in for another bite. Who wants pancakes now?  Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Be careful ordering any none meat dishes I guess the manager there doesn't believe it needs to have any flavor. Was particularly surprised by his rudeness. I guess four stars on Yelp has given them a sense of we don't need to care anymore."}
{"text":"Butterfield's is so, so good! It's a place my friends and I regularly go for brunch! The food is delicious, the coffee is amazing, and the atmosphere is fun. The service is pretty consistently awesome, and I think it's totally worth the wait - plan to have a 20-30 minute wait before you'll be seated."}
{"text":"Long wait time around 11 am, but mainly due because it was 1/1/18. 
No specials. They do have fresh squeezed orange juice. 
The service is very fast. People are nice. The prices are about average for breakfast places. 
The food was ok. Maybe their famous pancakes would have been better. 
I had the eggs Benedict, one egg was actually raw one egg was good. 
Overall, when it's my choice, I won't go there again. There are better options in the area."}
{"text":"This place has very delicious food and several gluten free options. We come here frequently to enjoy Sunday brunch. I recommend the corned beef hash skillet. If you eat gluten free I recommend their strawberry bliss Belgian waffle. If you get a chance to sit in either Willy's or Kylee's section then you are in for a treat, they are some of the best servers I have had at any restaurant. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The 35 minute wait was well worth it! We drove 25 minutes to dine here, based on all of the reviews. The building looks like a remodeled Village Inn. The interior was nice and simple. The ambience was bustling. Our server was courteous, and quick. I had the pancakes and an omelet. Everything was cooked to perfection. The pancakes were fluffy and had strawberries on top. The hashbrowns were crispy and golden brown. I would definitely make another trip to Butterfields as it is top notch!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town for 4th of July weekend and were searching for a nice local place to get a great breakfast and this restaurant definitely did not disappoint. I would give it 5 stars, but they forgot to bring my boyfriend his sausage links and when they finally did arrive we had already finished eating. I will definitely recommend this place, and I'm hoping next time we have a better experience with sausage links..."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in the valley! We come here every Sunday. Just can't get enough of the buttermilk pancakes, cheese grits, hash brown potatoes and the freshly squeezed orange juice! There is normally about a 30 min wait but the food comes out super fast."}
{"text":"This breakfast place delivers. It is worth the wait. You may want to come early or later to avoid the 15-25 minute wait. Pancakes are just one of the best around. Service was great. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Came here while vacationing in AZ. This place got lots of good reviews and I didn't really read them ahead so wasn't sure what to order. It's always a dilemma of sweet or savory breakfast. Hubby and I ended up sharing Mexican omelette and side of chocolate pancakes. Both were good but the pancakes were super fluffy, buttery and good. I usually like plain pancakes but chocolate chip ones were great too. Service was nice as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food delicious!! The service impeccable!! I love it!!! Oh and did I mention the food and service were to die for! My sister, who's visiting me from Cali, and I can't put our forks down lol. I'm officially team Butterfield!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast!  Everything is amazing but beware, the portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Delicious pancakes especially with mascarpone cheese and wild berries. Smoked Salmon scramble eggs are perfect! For sure be back!"}
{"text":"So with Pancake in the name I only have one thing to say.....Challenge ACCEPTED!!!! 

This place gets crazy busy on weekends so either come early or plan to wait accordingly.  

But once your in oh it's so worth it.  No matter what you get you cannot leave without getting pancakes. Share them if you must but please don't make the mistake of not getting any.  They have tons of varieties and I hear the Apple bake is a must (on my hit list).  

I'm a traditional guy so bring on the buttermilk. Simple but delicious. Keep them coming cause I'm about to do work!!! 

Overall great experience with exceptional staff.  Can't wait to come back (I see you apple bake)!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast man. This place is hands down the best breakfast restaurant in Scottsdale. Always consistent and amazing. Staff is friendly and helpful. Even on weekends this place is packed but the waits move very fast and you get seated without much wait. The hash browns are to die for."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning and was greatly disappointed to learn that they no longer serve their very unique and fabulous home fries, the number one reason I go there.  They've abandoned them in favor of hash browns, which of course you can find anywhere.  I spoke to the manager, who happened to be part of the ownership.  He was obviously the kind of person who loves to hear positive feedback only.  All he did when I told him that I was disappointed in the change was continually try to sell me on \"the fact\"  that his restaurant was the best there is.  It was similar to talking to a used car salesman.  He really didn't want to hear anything of an even slightly negative nature, with respect to his restaurant.  I told him about a restaurant that I commonly patronize (Country Boys) that serves a fabulous breakfast at about half the price.  He virtually scoffed at what I said and spoke as though I couldn't know what I was talking about.  I do.
Another thing about Butterfield's is that it's noisy as hell.  Not especially relaxing.  BTW Country Boys serves both hash browns and home fries.  This manager needs to learn a thing or two about customer service.  His attitude might best be described as \"The customer is always wrong.\"

Brian Klein"}
{"text":"Great food! Very clean place. Fast and friendly service. However, there is a very long wait on the weekends. This place is very popular so it gets very busy. Either go very early (8am) or later in the day. They are open until 3pm. We waited for about 35 mins after arriving around 10:15 am but it was well worth the wait. I will definitely be going back. This is the best breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"I am giving butterfield's four stars because the food, wait staff, actually everyone who worked there were great! All except the manager Christopher. I'm not sure where he received his training, but he could use a lot more when it comes to taking care of his patrons. You see, my 80 year old mother ordered a glass of juice, orange juice, one of which we knew was suppose to be good because they always were. She was thirsty took a large drink and then made a few funny faces. Said that it tasted different. We finished our meal and she took another drink when I told her if it wasn't good don't drink it anymore. 
I decided to bring this to the attention of Christopher the manager, owner, whatever. and he decides he wants to argue the point with her. Telling her that he just drank it and it was perfect. He kept trying to belittle her over and over again. All the time simling with a sacastic smile. I will never go back because of his rudeness and disrespect. He took the juice off the bill but only because he knew the way he was acting was not right! geese!  It was only a glass of oj. Sorry for trying to help you out by bringing the bad glass of juice to your attention so you wouldn't get other complaints."}
{"text":"Great service, and food. Everyone who works there is very friendly, and helpful. Best eggs Benedict I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Beverly Hills and stopped by here for breakfast. The food was super fresh and awesomely delicious. My coffee mug was constantly being refilled and dishes were quickly cleaned up."}
{"text":"We were here when they first opened up and decided to try it again to see if anything changed.  We were seated right away on hard chairs on a table for 4.  All the clutter in the middle with all the condiments is very disgusting and should be re-worked.  We put everything to the corner to get it out of our way.  Someone came right over to take our drink order and then they brought out the wrong tea, we ordered green tea, they brought us earl grey.  We ordered hot water with lemon and they forgot the lemon, we ordered Orange Juice and they forgot to bring it until we asked them more than 4x...Finally after the drink orders were straighten out and they brought us the correct stuff, our orders came out.  Avoid the hash browns, they have no flavor what so ever and the only thing in their HB are potatoes no salt or pepper, we sent them back and they bought out a very tiny bowl of fruit for us which had less than 10 small pieces of fruit.  Not real sure why they put powdered sugar on the pancakes, but they do and we did not know this so had to send our pancakes back, powdered sugar on cakes does not taste good, it is not a dessert but a breakfast item.

The gluten-free pancakes were dry, sweet and hard to eat without lots of fluid.  The make your own egg omelet with baby spinach an cheese was ok - light and airy.  Not real sure what all the fuss is about, but we were not impressed, the food is not a wow factor - everything is just either okay or not okay...nothing will wow your taste buds and there are other places in town which do this.  I wish someone someplace would make a great tasting gluten free pancake which is not dry.  We probably will not be back, not a favorite place of ours, we have had too many problems with their food or lack of good tasting food."}
{"text":"Good Benny. Not memorable at all. Food fills your gut though."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good! While in Scottsdale for a long weekend, we went to Butter's and then here and when I saw they had the same menu I was so happy. The food is quality and so tasty! Friendly staff. I can't wait to go back on my next visit to Arizona!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  Your standard breakfast place like IHOP.  I got pancakes and it had not taste.  I wasn't super impressed.

However, the service was excellent!!  But, I wouldn't drive out of the way to go there...."}
{"text":"Very yummy breakfast. Tasty and clean prepared.  Great stuff. Definitely will be back to try their lunch options."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. The food is good for a breakfast place but the service is always attrocious. 

Today after waiting for 15 minutes for a table we were called up for seating. 2 of our party were in the bathroom & there was a line. I explained this to the hostess & was told by the manager & the hostess that we would not be seated until they came out. I said we all walked in together you saw us. They said they would not seat us. Finally after another 10 minutes out came the rest of our party.  

I was so taken back by this rule of every member of your party being present to get a seat, I opted to leave. In an area were breakfast restaurants are plentiful I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again. 

If your looking for a breakfast place I would recommend Butter's or First Awakenings both within 2 miles of Butterfields. Your money is better spent at either of these other 2 restaurants as the service is stellar & the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is more of a hit or miss. First time I came here, I was with a group of 10-12 people. The service was excellent and food was tasty. I decided to come back a few months later with my mom and my brother. This time, it was not so good. Our server was very inattentive and we tried multiple times to get her attention. Not a great start. We got our food, which was mediocre at best. Orange juice was on the pricey side for a small glass. At the end, we, again, tried to get our servers attention to get some to go bags and to go butter. She left to go to the back for maybe 10 minutes until we had enough of waiting. Eventually, we just got ourselves plastic bags from the front and left. It really depends on the server you get; that's what makes a restaurant worthy of 5 stars to me.

Overall: 
Food: 4 
Service: 0"}
{"text":"They have one of the best breakfast in the Valley!! I recommend the Eggs' Benedict, Omelets, or if you have time Oven-Baked Pancakes.
The prices are super affordable, and definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"ZERO Complaints!  Clean nicely decorated restaurant, perfect temperature. Food was served quickly, cooked exactly to order and served hot. We both ordered the Whole Hog skillet and my little guy ordered the Mickey Mouse pancake and sausage.  The pancakes were very light and fluffy served with a sprinkling of powdered sugar like when we were kids. The scrambled eggs were fluffy and cooked all the way through without being over cooked.  Carafe of water on the table which is awesome. Perfect medium sized portions. Polite waitstaff.  Drove 45 minutes to get here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Drove 15 minutes out of the way and waited 20 minutes for the Dutch Boy Pancake (aka German Pancake) and it was totally worth it! Went back again the next am."}
{"text":"Oh Butterfield's, 

The food: If you come here and don't order pancakes you're weird.  At least order a side of pancakes to get your fix.  Butterfield's is known for their amazing pancakes no matter what kind you get.  They also make amazing breakfast dishes.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  

The staff:  Always friendly and always accommodating to your needs.  Get here early though because this place gets busy and packed quick during peak breakfast hours."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. 
I visited here many years ago and just went back a couple months ago. Still awesome. Fresh squeezed OJ. My daughter loved the MIckey Mouse pancake."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite breakfast place in Phoenix. Been to almost all the 4+ star places and nothing compares. Brought both my family and my fiancee's family here and not one person has been slightly dissatisfied. 

Banana creme pancakes, best thing I've ever ate. Whole hog skillet... actually has meat in it! 

But, the thing that separates this place is their omelets. I don't get them, but my fiancee, her family, and my dad love them. They are HUGE and the eggs are MEGA fluffy. 

Can't give this place enough credit. Absolutely love it and we eat here as often as budgetly possible."}
{"text":"I visited here from Los Angeles. My best friend goes to school at ASU and worked here. MY GOD. I wish this restaurant existed in Los Angeles. The food was the best American breakfast I've ever had in my whole life. This place makes all the breakfast places in Los Angeles a laughingstock! I'm surprised there's none here. I forget what my orders were called. They look good in the picture but, believe me, they tasted better than they way they look in the picture. They served orange juice that is genuinely fresh squeezed from oranges. The only thing I don't like about them is they don't give us flavored coffee creamer with our coffee. We have to stick with bland coffee creamer and add sugar. Nevertheless, this place still deserves 5 stars because the amazing food compensated for it's shitty coffee. If you're ever in proximity to Scottsdale in Arizona, you definitely have to check this establishment out. You're missing out in life if you don't try this place at least once. Not only was this place the best breakfast place I've ever eaten at, I think my meal, which was everything you see in the picture, only costed $10."}
{"text":"This is a damn good breakfast spot.  How do they get their omelets so fluffy?  The fresh OJ is awesome, and so is just about everything else I have had there.  I did get sick once after eating here, but I still like it a lot!"}
{"text":"Service was quick. Food was amazing. Scrambled eggs were fluffy, love the option of getting chocolate chip pancakes as a side"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for a delicious and satisfying breakfast in Scottsdale. I go there frequently because I cannot get enough of this place. My favorites are the whole wheat pancakes or one of the breakfast skillets, the latter big enough to serve two. I also like the friendly wait staff. Since breakfast tabs tend to be on the low side, I usually over tip because the wait staff is so great. Tell the wait staff what you want and you will get it. They also usually offer to refresh your beverage (tea, coffee, diet Coke) to go, which is a very nice touch in this thirsty desert climate. If they don't offer, just ask. I have never had a bad meal at this place. One waitress went above and beyond when I took a friend who was still woozy after a medical procedure for his first meal in a couple of days. He was being a little crazy and difficult, but our waitress handled it. There is usually a short wait, but this place is worth the wait. Once inside, be sure to look up so you don't miss the funky & fun decor touches."}
{"text":"Always a good experience, have been here several times on spring training trips, service is good. The omelette is great."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat in Scottsdale is butters. However today the line was too long and we couldn't wait. So I looked on yelp to find another breakfast place that was good. I happened to find this place. It was serendipitousbecause this place and butters are basically one in the same. Our wait was only 10 minutes and The food was great. By far my favorite are the cheesy grits. My only complaint would be that they do not serve their freshly squeezed orange juice and frosted glasses. It was such a good find this morning."}
{"text":"This place is our go to breakfast joint. It serves breakfast and lunch and is open until mid afternoon. It is always packed on the weekend but there is never usually more than a 20 minute wait. Recently they paired up with the nowait app where you can put yourself on the waitlist should there be one. The restaurant is nicely decorated with plenty of booths and tables to accommodate large and small parties. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. You can never go wrong with one of their omelette or pancakes. My personal favorite is the country Benedict with wild berry bliss pancakes. This place is a breakfast staple."}
{"text":"Good food for brunch and reasonably price.. I would have given it five stars, but the service is extremely slow. Otherwise it is an excellent place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Scrumptious meals all day long. The waitresses are professional and pleasant! The food and coffee is always hot. Only drawback is that on weekends it is jammed and will usually require a 5 minute wait for a table. This restaurant is spotless and the owner must take pride in such a fabulous establishment."}
{"text":"We had the same restaurant near Chicago and the quality of food and staff is just as good. Their food is very fresh and delicious! This is our newest goto restaurant for breakfast. Also, their coffee and orange juice are amazing. Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I want to share with you an incident that occurred  on April 15 at the Scottsdale Butterfield's.  I have enjoyed this restaurant with excellent customer service especially during busy times.  That's why I continue to eat there.  However after today's incident, I have second thoughts.

Today I came with my Aunt and friend at noon.  We were seated right away.   I understand the kitchen gets backed during this period but receiving our food at 1:30  is totally unacceptable.  I have never waiting this long for the food to be served.

I ordered a turkey burger which came out half cooked.  I spoke to our server that it needed to be sent back and rather than having the kitchen properly cook the burger she sent the manager over. Chris is the manager and told me that they cook all their burgers medium. In fact, he was quite rude.  I assume your managers receive proper training in etiquette but one \"must have slipped through the cracks.\"  I believe he has a problem understanding the difference between a hamburger and turkey burger.  A turkey burger needs to be cooked all the way through and he was arguing with me that that it was. It wasn't!

After waiting another half hour to get my new turkey burger, I did get one that was cooked through.  The server understood I was quite irritated over the entire incident and yet she failed to comp the burger as a way of saying they were sorry.  To my surprise, the bill came and was charge for the burger.  Again the manager came over and expressed under no circumstances would they take the charge off.  REALLY????  Never mind that we had to wait over an hour to get the food that was not properly cooked.

After expressing my displeasure with Chris that I would not be coming back, his response was  \"that was my choice.\"  Is that how your managers treat customers?

There was no need for his behavior.  I'm paying for an enjoyable meal with good service. What happened to trying to please your customers? No I was not looking for a free lunch, but  the inconvenience and the arrogance of the management should not be tolerated  by anyone.

I contacted Corporate Headquarters and it will be interesting to see if I get any response."}
{"text":"Great great breakfast place. The only reason I could possibly rate it down one star is because it does take FOREVER to eat here. The lines and waits are always long no matter what day or time of the morning you go. But, I do feel that that speaks volumes about a business and they are the best in the scottsdale area for breakfast. Don't leave without having a glass of the freshly squeezed orange juice- it will change your life! When ever we have family in town, we always opt to take them here because we know there is something for every one!"}
{"text":"Very busy. We were out of towners didnt expect it to bw this busy on a weekday. Good food, great service! Glad we waited. Fresh squeezed Orange Juice....yum!"}
{"text":"The grits are soo good.  I wanted to lick the bowl. The best grits I've ever had.  Creamy and tasty. The corned beef hash was pretty good too.  No potato pancakes, but they do have biscuits and gravy.  No idea how good they are.

The omelettes are so fluffy, they look a football.  I think there's someone in the back just pumping them full of air.  They didn't skimp on the cheese.  A little bland for my taste .  Needed salsa.  They charge $0.25 for a side of salsa.  

They move you in and out pretty fast.  Props to the bus boys. They move!! Good job.  Showed up around 8:30/9:00 on a Sunday morning. Got us in under five minutes.  Didn't make use feel rushed.   Kept the coffee flowing.  Service was friendly.

I'd go back just for the grits."}
{"text":"This was an incredible place to eat breakfast.The ingredients were very fresh I had the Mexican skillet which was amazing!!! The best part about it is that you can upgrade to have a side of signature pancakes for little additional cost. I got the cinnamon roll pancakes, best choice I made. I would highly recommend this place. This place is like be five-star version of IHOP"}
{"text":"Butterfield 's... Just as I remembered it. A little pricey, but still one of the best breakfasts you'll get anywhere. I had scrambled eggs, bacon and pecan waffles. One of the hardest thing about waffles is keeping them from getting hard by the time you're done with your eggs and bacon. Butterfield 's has come up with some kind of magic batter. Their bacon is thick cut, which scores big with me. 
  Getting in to Butterfield 's will take 20-30 minutes, but that is because the place is so popular. To avoid the wait, get there early. 
  Service at Butterfield 's is always amazing. I've never had any problems. My hard to please brother-in-law was even impressed.  The service was as consistent as the first time I went there almost three years ago. That means they consistently strive to be the best. 
  Sadly, my wife lives on the west side, and I live in Sierra Vista. But, the trek is well worth it every so often. I'd probably be even more overweight if I lived closer."}
{"text":"Best all american breakfast in AZ hands down. My friends who visit me from LA all ask to come back to Butterfields every time they come. 

Must try : egg white omelette is the fluffiest ever, skillets are to die for, best corned beef Benedict in town.. Jk.. In the world ! 

Don't ever change butterfields"}
{"text":"Service & food was absolutely amazing!! We'll be coming back here for sure. We live in phx & plan on driving to Scottsdale just to eat breakfast here."}
{"text":"Heaven is a place on earth only when cinnamon roll pan cakes are involved. Butterfields newest addition to its menu was my first taste of this restaurant and I was not disappointed. This place has a wonderful selection of both egg and flower dishes. Furthermore they have a great crepe selection which I will be trying next time. The pancakes were phenomenal. Great texture, taste, and presentation. Highly recommend this as a must stop for brunch."}
{"text":"Update: I stopped by on 6/8/16, bad experience all the way around. At least the coffee was excellent. Ordered the apple pancake at 1:40PM, only a few customers in the restaurant. I waited almost an hour and the manager says, I assume they told you what happened. NO, if they had told me they gave my order to someone 5 minutes after they walked in I would have ordered something that does not take 20 to 30 minutes. Then to make things worse, they gave me an undercooked pancake. The manger gives me $6.50 off my bill without me asking which was a small gesture, but I guess I look like I make minimum wage. If it had been properly cooked then at least they made some effort. Bottom line; this was a great restaurant, but not anymore. I hope the owner reads the reviews and takes some action as I used to love this place.

in 2014, I was so impressed:
I recently move to PHX and love breakfast. Unfortunately almost every breakfast restaurant has been a big disappointment so far. I have been to Butterfields 3 times and ordered something different each time. Excellent food, service with a great atmosphere too.  I wanted to try the apple pancake on the 2nd visit, but I did not have the time (30 mins) to wait. On my 3rd visit, I called them and asked if I could order it for 7:30 AM and I would be there at 7:15 or 7:20. They said no problem and made it clear they wanted me to be a happy customer, I was impressed. This baked huge pancake has enough calories for 2 days, but it was excellent ....... two tables next to me had never seen it before. One table said they were going to \"share\" one on their next visit based on just the great smell."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is always amazing and you get a lot of it. I live the cheese grits. Oreo pancakes & cinnamon roll pancakes are great as well. Their gluten free pancakes are also very tasty! The service is good as well."}
{"text":"Everything was so amazingly good. Bliss Berry Pancakes were so good they should not be legal!!!!  Fresh squeezed OJ was great!! and the omelettes and scrambles were so fluffy and full of flavor. my only regret was that i couldn't finish every bite.  Super friendly staff with quick service. Highly recommend for breakfast/brunch in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Possibly the BEST breakfast I have EVER had. Simple ham skillet w/ side of buttermilk pancakes. ( HMOP Skillet on their menu) Potatoes crispy, Eggs amazingly fluffy and the pancakes were almost better without syrup.....
I might have written one other review on here but I felt compelled to (give 5 stars and )write one for this place."}
{"text":"I like to think I know my breakfast spots, I have been to a ton of them in the area. I have gone to this place twice and both times left horribly disappointed. 

The first time I ordered eggs and I also tried the pancakes. The eggs were actually the worst I have had in a few years. The pancakes were very dry. The only reason I went back is because I live close and I did not try their signature item, the oven baked pancake.....

....which requires 30 minutes to be cooked. So after waiting 50-60 minutes for a freaking pancake I realized I was right the first time I came here. Not only was there nothing special about my order, but it wasn't any good. If the pancake was good it would have made up for the wait, but it didn't. 

I am not knocking anyone else, but I think people who really enjoyed this place just need to get out to some other breakfast spots."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've visited in a very long time.  Both my husband and I had an Omelette which was fantastic, and the hash browns were light, fluffy and not at all greasy as they sometimes can be.  You would expect a pancake house to excel in their pancakes only, but all the food was outstanding.  Service was excellent, servers were very friendly and worked as a team.  Definitely recommend and would visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Found Butterfield's through a friend of my Mom's who had eaten there at their Illinois locations. When we got there my heart sunk as I saw the huge line outside waiting to be seated, I went to the counter and signed in and was advised it would be about 15 minutes, True to their word, we were seated within 15 minutes. They make a great cup of coffee and the fresh squeezed orange juice is great. I ordered the California scramble, it was phenomenal, the eggs were cooked perfectly and the portion as huge. My wife had the New Orleans style french toast, which is french toast with sauteed bananas on top, she really enjoyed it. 

We enjoyed the food so much we returned with friend the following weekend."}
{"text":"This is what breakfast food should taste like! Their pancakes are perfection, they are doing right by their name!

Decided to have breakfast here for the first time since it was recommended by my colleague. After reading through their simple, yet extensive list of breakfast foods of pancakes, crepes, benedicts, waffles, scrambles, breakfast burritos and sides. I decided on getting the simple Blueberry Pancakes with a side of Corned Beef Hash. She ordered the Wildberry Crepes with a side of Hash Browns.

The food came out pretty fast, so it was timely and the food looked absolutely pleasant and almost fake how well presented it looked. The pancakes were soft, fluffy and with a blueberry sauce that was sweet and slightly tart. The sauce didn't entirely douse the pancakes either, so I liked that. The pancakes tasted so good, it's good enough to eat on it's own! Butterfield's is definitely on it's pancake A game. I tried a bit of my friend's crepe that was topped with berry sauce, whip and stuffed with cream. So delicious, not super sweet and definitely a treat to please one with a sweet tooth however. I liked my Corned Beef Hash, definitely less greasy with finer pieces of potato but was a good contrast with my sweet pancakes.

The service was great, our server was attentive and did frequent checks despite the busy morning. The place itself is so open, modern and clean. Definitely a more sophisticated version of your typical breakfast spot. Their menu has a good variety and have gluten free and protein options. The pricing may be a bit steeper than other places, but for the quality of food, service and atmosphere it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I can tell you it  WON'T be my last! 

Here's what I had:

    Two (2) fried eggs, over-easy
    Three (3) sausage patties
    A medium sized bowl of creamy grits
    Two (2) pancakes w/syrup
    Small glass of freshly squeezed OJ
    A couple of cups of coffee with cream
      . . . and a ton of water!

I have to admit I didn't finish it all; but it was not for want of trying! 

This little piggy tried very hard to finish it all . . . I had to come home and take a nap!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. 
I throughly enjoyed this place! My boyfriend ordered the signature pancake (cinnamon roll) and I had a really delicious egg, hash brown, and sausage meal and it really hit the spot! I wish I lived in AZ! but not the weather pleaseeee. Anyway, parking is convenient, location is easy to access and service was quick!"}
{"text":"Well, where to start? Myself and a lady friend came here on a Saturday morning, expecting a crowd and with some high hopes on how good the food is, do to many of my friends telling me how amazing it is here. 

Huge crowd that I was expecting? No where to be found.

Delicious food? Pretty much every direction I looked. 

I ordered some french toast, eggs, an English muffin and some fruit (I like a big breakfast). I was pleasantly surprised at the speed to which it came out of the kitchen. Quality of the food is just outstanding, even down to the fresh fruit, which in most restaurants can be absolutely disgusting. 

Service was pretty great as well, the second we arrived we were greeted and sat, our server was an excellent ambassador to the restaurant. Being it was my first time, I just had some general curiosity about the business and she answered my questions without hesitation, was always there when we needed her for something.

Overall just a great experience."}
{"text":"I have eaten here often since they opened 11 years ago. They have such a high standard for their food for an example they cut up all their own fresh fruit and poach their own chicken for the delicious chicken salad sandwich I had today. Other favorites of mine would include the eggs Benedict which is the best I have had in the valley. Their salads are fresh and delicious. Their portions are very large. The service is excellent and the owners care about your experience there. I highly recommend giving this place a try. I also love their French toast and they are forever giving you refills of your beverage. Their omelettes are the fluffiest omelettes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Monday a couple of weeks ago.  First impression was that I was amazed at how clean the place is.  It only got better from there.  The service was impeccable very friendly but not intrusive.  Then there was the food!!! WOW I have to say this was the best breakfast we have ever had.  I am a fan of eggs benedict and not often am I impressed, but theirs is truly amazing.  My husband had one of their combos and was totally happy with it.  Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a bite before heading to the airport.  Line was long but wait was only a few minutes more than promised.  I had two scrambled eggs (mediocre), two pancakes (fine), with cheese grits (good and cheesy but needed a little seasoning).  Service was efficient and friendly and prices were good ($4.70 with tax)."}
{"text":"I always think of that woman-shaped syrup bottle when I come here.  I think her name was Mrs. Butterworth?  

Anyways, this is a delicious breakfast spot!  They serve up all the tasty morning classics, like pancakes, belgian waffles, eggs, omelets, etc. But they also offer slight variations by making them with fresh fruit.  

The portions are huge too, so you'll probably end up with leftovers.  It gets pretty busy in there on the weekends, so you might end up waiting 20 minutes or so.  

If you've been wanting to try a new breakfast spot, this is it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for their famous Dutch oven pancakes (order when you sit down, can take up to 30 minutes to make). Their portions are huge!! And everything is so good...from their eggs to the perfectly made hash browns to their tender ham steak to even their soup of the day (creamy pasta chicken soup). Their fresh squeezed OJ may rival their pancakes for the best of the meal (yes it's THAT fresh!!!)"}
{"text":"I visited family in Scottsdale during the week, and we ate out every day.
We went to this place yesterday morning.
We had to wait 15 or 20 minute, but it was noon and we had a party of eight, so I'm not holding that against them.
I saw 20 different kinds of omelets, skillets, burgers, and other things, but I knew what I was getting before we sat down.
Most of my party were kosher, but they had no problem omitting this and adding that, etc.
The food on the menu looked healthy; lots of vegetable omelets, the they had turkey bacon, stuff like that.
It took me a little while to find what I wanted: A ham and cheese omelet, hash browns, toast and two order of thick bacon. It was by far the least healthy combination that they had.
I laughed when they gave me the choice of fruit or hash browns.
Every item on my plate was excellent, but the omelet set itself apart from the pack.
It was the lightest, fluffiest, tastiest omelet that I've had in a long while.
I usually finish-up what other people leave over, but everyone cleaned their plate :(
I still can't believe how good those eggs were."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Another Chicagoland transplant that I grew to love there, and still like here.  The pancakes really are the star here, every other dish is pretty average,

On our last visit, I went off-script and ordered the waffle.  Apparently you can order them \"well done\" to make them crisper on the outside like a Belgian waffle, but even ordering like this - the waffle was just very average.  The base pancake batter that they use for their waffles doesn't translate as well into the waffle form.

The bacon, too, is average at best.  Average thickness, average texture, nothing special.

The pancakes, especially the specialty pancakes, are worth the extra money.  So is paying the premium for the real maple syrup and not using the sugar-water on the table.

In the past, I've had the apple oven-baked pancake, the banana, the chocolate chip, and the cinnamon roll.  All are good to very good pancakes.  The oven-baked apple pancakes are thick and hearty and super filling.  The other pancakes are thinner but have enough filling and topping to make it worth the extra money for them.

There's typically a wait, and it sucks having o wait outside in the summer.  But turnover is pretty quick and it is definitely worth the wait for this place if you're in the mood for a pancake."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Staff are super attentive, especially when it comes to coffee refills. Portions are huge, perhaps too big. But breakfast is always delicious. If dining on a weekend, expect a but of a wait as this location is very popular."}
{"text":"Best Service around! Used the most incredible ingredients... The last time I left a place this satisfied I was in my underwear"}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast spot! Denver omelette is my favorite! The servers are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Great vibes in here, it was busy but we got seated very quickly because the service is wicked fast. I got the Mexican egg burrito (wasn't the best I've ever had) and it was very good. Pancakes and bacon were also very good. Reasonably priced. Would come here again if I lived here :)"}
{"text":"Good news for Butterfield's. After a couple years or so of having altered the menu, it appears that they have brought back the ever-so-popular oven baked specialties.

Although the menu is not 100 percent the same as before, having brought back the baby apple pancake and dutch baby have made the trip up to Scottsdale worth the trip for an indulgent breakfast.

Aside from the noisy and busy environment, and tacky but fitting decor, Butterfield's does have some stand-out items on their menu. From the fresh-squeezed juices (albeit small and overpriced portions) to the unique egg specialties and pastry items, this is the place for an occasional breakfast treat when you want something a bit more upscale than the traditional chain diners.

The highlight on the menu, in my opinion, is the baked baby apple pancake. Prepare for the 30 minute wait, and if you want any shot in being able to finish a decent portion of the plate-sized \"pancake\", don't eat anything before your visit. The large treat comes to the table piping hot and is puffed up a couple of inches tall. Although all of the caramelized apples and brown sugar are begging to be eaten at the moment's notice, do yourself a favor and wait another 5 minutes to avoid burning your mouth and ruining the rest of your meal with this fresh-out-of-the-oven delight.

The apple pancake (more like an apple pie that you can have all to yourself), is packed with the equivalent of no less than at least 2 granny smith apples. The thick, doughy crust and the sticky and crunchy brown sugar topping keep you forking for more. Despite the time it may take you to work through this beast, the steam keeps pouring out.

The service is pretty decent, but with the crowd of people and all of the glass and ceramic cups and plates, the clatter and chatter can get very ear piercing. If you come on the weekend, expect a long wait, but the staff moves tables quickly and the restaurant is nice and clean."}
{"text":"Consistently great breakfast. Rivals US Egg as our favorite breakfast joint. US Eggs protein pancakes are better but Butterfields has cheese grits that will rock your world. Also, fresh squeezed OJ."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I have ever been to. Pancakes are fantastic. Eggs are very good and the hash browns are great! If you are able to be in lesley's section, she is the best! Never have to ask for a refill on coffee, she is always on top of it. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Not a fan due to service.  Food was good."}
{"text":"Food was great. Power pancakes and verde eggs. Yummy. Fresh squeezed orange juice and Americano coffee. 
We will be back!! 
Oh, and our server was great. She even took our pic with the orange juice squeezer."}
{"text":"This place is a busy place with consistently good food.  They have a big menu with lots of choices that you don't see in the other breakfast / lunch chains, which makes coming here a nice change.  I personally like the fresh squeezed orange juice and love that they offer lox and bagel (from their lunch menu).  My husband loves the variety of pancakes, waffles and especially the crepes.  If you haven't tried them yet, you are in for a treat.

If there is a wait, don't worry, it moves quickly and is worth the wait."}
{"text":"First off, I gotta say that what aggravates me about the Phoenix breakfast scene (lol did I just make a thing) is that all of it seems to be extremely hipster trendy prissy with regard to most eateries' decor/menu...

So upon arriving in Scottsdale I figured Butterfield's would be just as good as any place I had decided to pass on while searching the Phoenix metro area...but am I so glad I came here.

A) Extremely CLEAN and bright inside, nicely decorated and open, servers galore. It's in Scottsdale so it's a nice area and judging from the cars in the parking lot, higher end income...

B) Great wait staff. Someone is always walking around with coffee, you do need to ask for cream but it's amazing cream in a tiny little chilled metal cream pitcher. 

C) This place is a pancake house...the pancakes are excellent, though not sure if the size of the cakes I got were standard or smaller, since I got the egg plate...if that is standard size they're pretty small but delicious none the less. Real maple syrup at the table(?) I forgot to ask but it seemed it by the way it poured. I ordered an extra egg for 99c and what came out seemed like five eggs so that was awesome. The bacon, three pieces, was excellently crisp and good sized, very delicious. And, I was able to sub hashbrowns (sliced potatoes) out for cottage cheese.

All in all this place is the place to go for breakfast in 'Phoenix'. Whether there are comparable places in Phoenix I wouldn't know since all those I actually went to sucked and either had lame menus, no one to wait on me, or laughable prices (yah I went to a few and just left). I would highly recommend coming here, it's worth it in every way. Ted is a great manager and Bree, my server, was great too."}
{"text":"I had the eggs Benedict. It was marvelous. The service was great, in spite of a jam packed building. I'm not much of a breakfast person to be honest, but my girlfriend is. And I still enjoyed the food, and that is saying a lot!"}
{"text":"I brought a bus with 21 ladies in for breakfast/lunch after a tour to Cosanti. Although they don't take reservations, the manager, Chris, had his staff quickly set us at a variety of tables within about 10 minutes. Our wait staff were excellent and the food was delicious and abundant. Checkout was handled and we were in, served, and out within an hour. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area. 
Viewpoint Ladies"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place. They seem to always have lots of people waiting and now I know why. We arrived with a group of over 10 people and they managed to push some tables together and seat us in a reasonable amount of time. Our waitress was also super cheerful, fast and accurate. She got all of our orders right and managed to have all plates on the table at the same time.

Best oatmeal in town. They actually use the slow cooking whole grain Scottish oats and not that instant Quaker stuff. I love the healthy menu choices, such as light rye bread and egg white omelets. I had the spinach and feta egg white omelet and it was awesome. 

The menu is so extensive that you could literally come here for a month and never order the same thing twice."}
{"text":"I just had breakfast here for the 1st time and it was amazing!  Funny thing is I went on a random weds late morning and there was a line out the door.  I ordered eggs and hash browns and felt like I was eating a home cooked breakfast!!  Definitely recommend this spot if you are in the hunt for a new breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"I loved the wheat pancakes here this weekend!  There were generous potions on those, as well as the eggs, and my coffee cup which was refilled very often without asking.  The side of fruit was delicious, but could've been bigger for the price.  It was easy to get a table without a wait in a Saturday, and the customer service was excellent.  My dad loved his French toast and bacon."}
{"text":"It was Boxing Day and I didn't want to settle on plain ol' hotel breakfast food.  I wanted to go somewhere special before I depart from this beautiful city.  Good thing I did my homework before coming to Arizona for vacation!  Or else I would have missed out of Butterfield's Pancake House!  

It was packed and busy when we arrived.  I was surprised to see that they only open until 3PM.  We were promptly seated and handed menus.  There are so many choices, they all sounded so good.  My mother thought if each of us ordered something, it would've been too much.  But I said.. Mom.. This is probably a once in a lifetime breakfast at Butterfield's.  We have to make it a great one!  So we ended up ordering four meals:  California Scramblers with pancakes, Denver Omelette with English Muffin, Farmer Skillet with Biscuit, a Crab Cake Sandwich, and two cups of orange juice.

When the food came, I was impressed.  Not only was the food appealing to the eye, but it also tasted delicious!  There was a whole lot of food!  So much that we could not finish.  The orange juice was one of the sweetest I've ever had.  It makes me think they added sugar in it but I doubt it.  The only downside is that it is quite pricey for a breakfast meal.  Maybe if you count it a brunch then its okay.  Or maybe we just over ordered.  ($50 for breakfast yikes!)

Regardless of the price, I would still come here often for a satisfying breakfast meal and delicious orange juice."}
{"text":"Strawberry cheesecake French toast was awesome,  bacon was awesome,  breakfast burrito was awesome,  You get the Pattern?  Everything was great,  a little expensive for a breakfast but you could argue the quality of the food is worth it and you'd be right."}
{"text":"I've been going to Butter's for years. After moving to Scottsdale my boyfriend and I discovered that Butterfield's was conveniently located just about 5 minutes away from us. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. Also, their service is always outstanding. They never let you wait for too long before seating you and starting you off with some fresh squeezed orange juice. This is my favorite place for breakfast, brunch, and lunch!!"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place out but just have been lazy to make the 30 min commute. Finally we did, well we were on that side of town so we stopped in. The wait on a Friday morning around 9 or so was 15 mins. I got the banana pancakes and eggs, boyfriend had a scramble with protein pancakes. Both pancakes were amazing. Top banana cakes I've ever had. The egg whites seemed too greasy, but they gave me what looked like 5 egg whites, huge portion. We did have to pay $2 for a small side of real maple syrup. Seems about the size of a jelly packet which seems a bit overpriced. Anyways, will be back again for the pancakes!"}
{"text":"As usual, awesome meal and excellent service!
Jessica, our table hostess, was very personable, professional and attentive.  (even took time to \"share a laugh\" when we showed her a couple goofy pictures of us!)    
Ted (restaurant manager) took some time to chat with us.  We let him know how well the establishment is managed and that we always enjoy our dining experience at the location!
Thank you all ~ management, friendly seating hosts, wait staff and chefs ~ for doing your best to make the restaurant exceptional!  
We always make sure to tell folks about Butterfields, as well as bringing our out-of-town guests with us to dine here!

{"text":"Butterfields - Great food, great service and great value! The staff is friendly, service is great.  Food arrives in a short amount of time usually 5-7 minutes after ordering. Fresh squeezed OJ is a plus! I personally like the Santa Fe scramble with chorizo, red jalapenos & cheese. The menu is good with a lot of diverse choices for breakfast and lunch items."}
{"text":"These are best pancakes I've ever had. If you like berries, go for the berry pancakes with mascarpone. You won't be disappointed. 
Service is quick and people are friendly! Just make sure you get here early on the weekends. It gets crowded quickly!"}
{"text":"Late breakfast here today. If fact, I am typing this while I sit at Butterfield's. This is a step up from the Denny's down the street, but nothing miraculous. I ordered two eggs over medium, wheat toast, hash browns, and an OJ... all tasted just fine. 

I agree with other reviewers that at $11.17 before tip this is a little overpriced for what I ordered. (the same breakfast at Randy's on Chaparral is under $7)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing when I came two years ago and still is amazing! They are very busy but we were seating pretty quickly. 

The fresh OJ is simply amazing. I got the Garden Skillet that has saut√©ed veggies on a bed of hash brown potatoes & cheese topped with eggs. SO GOOD! 

My boyfriend got the chicken sausage with eggs which were good but the Dutch baby he had was tasty. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"What an awesome breakfast spot.  I was taking a chance coming here at 9 am on Sunday morning. I thought I wouldn't be able to get into this place because of how popular it was. Well to make surprise the wait was only fifteen minutes and well worth it. The food was exceptional and the service even better. Something so simple as creamy grits were to die for. Thanks Butterfields  for making my Sunday morning awesome."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Consistent quality. Not sure how they get their scrambled eggs so perfect and fluffy. They own two other locations called \"butters\" located on northside and via Linda. All are very good. Worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"Loved the Oreo pancakes and strawberry shortcake French Toast! Freshly squeezed orange juice was also very tasty. Service is top notch and food comes out pretty quick even though this place can get extremely busy on Saturday/Sunday mornings. Great location in Scottsdale as well."}
{"text":"Butterfield's has great food.  It's nearly all bad for you, but it tastes great and if you don't care about your health and want  to load up on carbs and sugar, it's really tasty breakfast griddle food.  That is all they have to offer.  The wait times are absolutely insane.  Expect to wait a minimum of 45 minutes on the weekends, up to an hour and a half.  The interior has some of the strangest/oddest art I've ever seen, there are flying pancakes with wings along with giant waffles and other weird things on the ceiling.. and the acoustics... oh my gosh the acoustics.  Busy restaurants usually have the sense (and the money) to install some type of sound deadening material.. be it booth dividers, ceiling tiles, carpeting, walls etc.. Not Butterfields!  They make it one giant open rectangle with wooden floors.. you can forget trying to communicate with anyone in your party, especially if they're more than 2 feet away from you.. you can't hear anything.. it's a huge headache.  I've dealt with all of this for many years, and I've supported their other location (Butters) on Hayden and Via de Ventura.  I've brought countless family members here, had business meetings, and even just picked up to go orders like I did today..  

When I went in today to pick up pancakes, I said this to the girl at the front:  \"I love your fresh squeezed orange juice, and I'd like to get 2 larges, but I can't tell you how many times in the past I've paid 8.00 for a single large OJ and I get home and it's horribly bitter with no sweetness, and I have to dump it out.. may I please have a single taste in a shot glass or a tiny container of some kind, even a tablespoon, just to see what it tastes like today?\"  By the look on her face, you would have thought I just asked her to solve a Chinese algebraic equation...  she had to ask some type of head hostess girl/manager in charge up front... I repeated myself, told the girl I had been coming here for years, and I just didn't want to have one more time where I wasted 16.00 on two large OJs that tasted like some type of orange oil cleaning fluid.. (OJ changes in taste from season to season, and this restaurant uses a machine that compacts the entire orange, so in addition to the orange juice, it crushes the orange peel/rind and you get all of the orange oil in from peel as well.. sometimes its just to much, as orange oil is literally used as a cleaning agent/grease remover in many natural cleaners).  In the middle of a busy Sunday, this girl literally tells me she has to \"radio a manager\".  I waited again.  She listens to the radio and says, \"My manager said we can't do that.\"  I didn't make a scene, nor was I rude, but I was truly baffled.. I said to her, \"Oh o.k., that's really odd, because they've done it before, and they do it anywhere I go that sells fresh squeezed orange juice.\"  I added, \"Who is the manager, is it still the brothers that have managed this place for years?\"  She said it was and mentioned their names.  If the 3 people in charge of managing this store can't give a known long time customer a tablespoon of orange juice to make a 16.00 sale, they don't need my business, and they've most certainly earned this negative review.  I've thrown away who knows how many bad orange juices and never asked you for a refund or anything else.  Obviously with the volume you do, you don't need to put forth any effort to make people happy anymore.  Lucky you."}
{"text":"I went to Butterfield's based on ratings from Yelp. I was not disappointed. I had the New Mexico skillet and my wife had the Mexican Omelette. Food was great, coffee was better than average restaurant coffee, and service was good. The only negative was a little bit of a wait, but that's a good problem. I'll be back?"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal here. The only downside to this place is the wait time on the weekends (but that's not their fault). My go-to is the protein power pancakes (wheat pancakes topped with granola and bluberries). They are perfect before or after a long weekend run/workout. If you're feeling a little more adventurous (or this is your cheat meal), go for one of the skillets with a side of cinnamon roll pancakes.... it is to die for. Nothing but *****5 Stars."}
{"text":"Ordered the Novalox and asked for extra salmon.  Manager said that they could not sell me extra salmon and that I would need to purchase a whole additional Novalox a $11.  I'm not paying $11 for an extra few slices of salmon.

Been coming here for 9 years and have always been able to get extra salmon.  Not sure what changed.  Seems like poor customer service and decision making.

Disappointed with the service here."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptional. Anyone that has ever eaten here knows that. This review is more about the service. Our server is Deana. She is the only server for us. BY FAR one of the best servers that we have ever had, in any restaurant, in any city, EVER!

Her attention to detail is unmatched. From the moment we sat down, she begin to wow us with a warm welcome. She mentioned how she almost waited on us the last time that we were in. Who remembers almost waiting on a family?  Even more impressive, is the time that she spoke of was 3 months ago!

I knew at that moment, that we were in excellent hands! She was mindful of everyone at our table, even our children. She made sure to give them plastic cups, with lids and straws, instead of glass. She made certain not to put the hot plates in front of them, and informed us that they were hot. She paused for a moment as we prayed. (We always pray at meals, home or out.) Many servers are in such a rush that they interrupt the prayer in order to hand you a napkin! Not Deana! 

This review could go on an on, but I will end it with my recommendation. Go see Deana at Butterfield's. Ask for her, sit in her section, and you will feel like family. (But, don't treat her like family at tip time! Take care of servers who take care of you!) :)

Oh, yeah, the food was great too!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location as well as to their Butter's locations, and can unequivocally say that they hire the nicest people. Their staff is always pleasant and polite which is wonderful. 
And equally great is their food - it is always served hot, tastes fresh and delicious and has never been anything less than perfect. 
I love their Eggs Benedict and the tasty hollandaise sauce, the Dutch Baby pancake is delicious, my friends have loved the waffles and pancakes as well. There are lots of condiments on the table for those who like to spice up their food. The coffee is smooth and their restaurants are always impeccably clean. 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast spot in town!  I'm visiting from California and was looking for somewhere to have great pancakes.  Well this is the spot.  My sister and I came here on a Saturday late morning and it was crowded, but they sat us quickly.  As soon as we sat down there was someone at our table asking if we wanted coffee.  The coffee was great - fresh and much more flavorful than your normal breakfast spot coffee.  The service was phenomenal as well.  I had pancakes, bacon, and hash browns.  My sister had French toast, scrambled eggs and bacon.  We were both singing as we ate (it was that good!).  Great food, great service, and low prices...can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Yet another amazing meal at Butterfields! (Scottsdale and Shea, for anyone reading who may not be familiar with this location)
Our visit was made even more enjoyable with the friendly, professional and attentive service of Megan!  (Thank you Megan!))

{"text":"Solid food.  My egg white veggie omelet was huge.  I would return to Butterfield's for breakfast."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try this. I drive past daily for work. I enjoyed it and will probably come back again"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and found this place on Yelp. Our 16 yr old son was excited about s'mores pancakes!  He did not LOVE the pancakes. We also orders the veggie omelette and the HMOP. My veggie omelette was bland and the hash browns were crusty and not greasy, a plus, but not very flavorful. HMOP was just okay.  We also ordered the side of pancakes. Wild berry bliss has a layer of cream in between and was overkill, too sweet. The banana pancakes with cream were covered on tons of cream too. No need for syrup really. I won't put Butterfield's on return visit list.  Probably a bit overrated. They kill you on extras.  Egg whites/beaters. OJ was $5.28. Server Janell was very nice."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to breakfast restaurants.  Need to get there early or late because the waitlist gets very long.  The food  is that good.  The food is also very fresh and tasty.  We've never had a bad breakfast here and although it's a little bit of a drive from where we live it is so worth it.  Very clean, and easy to find parking.  Service is also very good for such a large restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing classic American diner. Famous for their pancakes and breakfasts. We had eggs Benedict, salmon omelette and blueberry filled pancakes. All of it was the best! The place was full for lunch so obviously we're not the only ones who think this place is great.
Friendly and efficient staff. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Fairly good breakfast place in the valley.  Just a warning, it is typically very busy so plan to arrive early to avoid large crowds and long waits.  They do their best to get you in though!  

All the food is excellent!  The menu is a large array of breakfast favorite, southwestern renditions, and some unique items as well.  

Staff is friendly and attentive.  Would highly recommend to anyone, better than Denny's or IHOP."}
{"text":"Waiting forty five minutes to be seated only to get over cooked eggs putts one in a lousy mood for the day"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and my wife said the orange juice was the best beverage she has ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Food is great, services and food are fast.  Can be busy during peak times."}
{"text":"I really don't know what all the rage is about this place-why is it so busy all the time?? The food I've had here on several occasions is just average. I've had the omelettes -decent, but I've had way better elsewhere or even at home! Breakfast burrito stinks - so disappointed! I make a breakfast burrito at home that tastes wayyyy better! So when I go out to eat, especially something simple like breakfast it better be good! I'm a savory breakfast water so I can't speak for their sweets but maybe that's what this place is known for- my husband loves their pancakes and French toast."}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH. DELICIOUS! The place was packed but they turn tables quick and have a very helpful, diverse staff. The menu is extensive and everything looks so mouthwatering. I ordered an omelette and one gluten free pancake and it was sooo good! Great place for a typical breakfast experience but an outstanding menu!"}
{"text":"This was a great find for us when staying in Scottsdale. The fresh squeezed orange juice was delicious! My husband and I were able to order a delicious and filling breakfast. 

He ordered the banana nut bread French toast and I got a veggie omelette. Honestly the plates were HUGE. My omelette came with both potatoes and toast.

My only gripe is that I saw sooo much food going to waste there! I hope in the future they can offer smaller plates or at least earth friendly to go packaging. (Styrofoam is so terrible for the environment!)

The service was pretty good and the wait was not long at all!"}
{"text":"Great coffee.  Good food.  Very clean and well managed. Servers are well trained. A squeeky clean spot. Kind of a hotel feel to it. Packed but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times and have never had a bad experience. 

There are many items to choose from.  The food is great and fresh.  An added bonus is the friendly and attentive staff.  

The only downside is the wait but it is worth it and they really do move people through fairly fast."}
{"text":"Their manager from Chicago, \"Tim\", is rude to customers, especially natives to the Phoenix area. I have an allergy to certain vegetables, and politely asked if they could be replaced with other vegetables at no charge. The waitress said yes. Upon receiving our receipt I was charged $1.00 per ingredient.  When I politely asked for an explanation from the waitress, Tim ran over with his chest puffed up like he was going to fist fight me and said,\" Everyone charges for replacing vegetables in food!\", I responded that in actuality, many restaurants exchange ingredients as a courtesy, especially for people with allergies. Tim then proclaimed,\"I have never heard of that and I've been here for 3 years!\".  Despite his proclamations, I remained calm and said, \"I have lived near this location my entire life (34 years), and Oregano's Chicago Pizza across the street has always accommodated this request without an upcharge.\"  He made yet another proclamation, \"I'm from Chicago!\".  I responded,\"Well, I am not.\"  He fired back,\" Well, let's get real, how many of you people are there here?\".  At this point, my wife and I could no longer put up with his lack of professionalism, and left the restaurant.  As a native to the Phoenix metro, I'm am aware that there are not many natives here compared to the mass of Chicagoans that have invaded, but I have not once taken issue with them and nor them me, until this visit to the Chicago-biased Butterfields.  I have definitely never been referred to as \"you people\" as a Phoenix native before.  This review is as perplexing to me as to why a restaurant manager from Chicago would move here to pick a fight with the entire native population to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Me and my husband always go there for breakfast. Either with friends or just two of us. The design of the resto is very beautiful. They always keep it clean there and they service is fast and easy going. You do have to wait sometimes a very long time to be seated but it's worth it. There is a reason for that, they are good, so a lot of people come for breakfast. Prices are friendly and food is good!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in Scottsdale! Amazing service and food. This place is worth waiting for a table no matter how long the wait is! Power protein pancakes are my personal favorite."}
{"text":"So place serves good food but they are very strict with their customers. If you know what you want to drink and eat you can't order it right away in one order. You HAVE TO wait for your drinks first and only after you are allowed to order your food. Also you never know how long your drink order will take. 
Manager explained me why they have such a policy. All to convince the kitchen, not the customers. 

I work in food and beverage industry and this is my first time experiencing nonsense policy like that...
If you are looking for a good breakfast place, butterfields is ok option, but there are lots of other great places where you can order your food and drinks at the same time haha."}
{"text":"The manager was extremely rude. We were clear to let them know when ordering that we were vegetarian, but ham showed up in our potatoes. They would not even remove the potatoes from the bill! Awful customer service!"}
{"text":"I'm confused. In my first review of Butterfield's, I awarded it four stars mainly in recognition of their delicious specialty pancakes.. A revision to two stars was prompted by a horrible experience with uncaring staff and inconsistent food. And now, I'm upgrading it to three stars after a mostly good visit. I think three stars is about right. They really do have a great menu, but going there shouldn't feel like such a gamble. I have several more relaxing breakfast destinations I greatly prefer (see the Scottsdale/PV best breakfast list I'm working on)."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! I like to come on the weekends with the family. Only lousy part is the ridiculously long waits on the weekends sometimes, but I guess thats a good thing. Great OJ, good good selection, great atmosphere. To who ever said its too loud try planning your next meal at a library :) definitely recommend, just make sure you beat the weekend rush!"}
{"text":"This place is so far from me, But i would do the drive again for their breakfast!!!!  The pancakes for sureeee!
I got the veggie egg white omelette with jalape√±os. TWO thumbs up! the veggies were crunchy and the omelette was cooked perfectly. It comes with two pancakes, it was so soft, warm and tasteful, no butter on it of course. My mom is a huge fan of their corn beef hashbrown. She brags about it all the time. Haha :D

The customer service here is wonderful. Never had a problem since I've gone here.

I'll be back again!  :D"}
{"text":"I have been to Butterfield's twice and I'd  go back again. The most recent time I've been, I noticed that a couple of the hostess girls were a bit unfriendly - I like to see a smiling face early in the morning. Luckily, at 8 on a Saturday we only had to wait 5 minutes. But, our waitress was very, very nice. I think this must be personal preference, because many love their pancakes, but I don't really like them much. They seem dry - I've definitely had better pancakes. BUT, their fresh squeezed orange juice is to die for! Delicious. All and all, a nice place to have breakfast occasionally."}
{"text":"I have been to Butterfields several times over the years, and while I always thought it was good, I just never seemed 100% impressed. I'm not sure, but I think they've expanded the menu, meaning there were plenty of things that sounded awesome for me to decide on. So yesterday I had the Strawberries & Cream Belgian Waffle. I gotta say... it was damn good. Exceeded my expectations in fact. One thing I hate about ordering breakfast with whipped cream, is it's usually the light aerosol can stuff that melts into a pool of liquid about a minute after set in front of you. Not the case here! As you can see, they use heavy whipped cream, and lots of it. The strawberries were very fresh and ripe. It was really perfect. Price was not terrible either."}
{"text":"This is a late review. I met up with my sister and her husband here for breakfast a couple of months ago for my b-day as it was close to a business I was consulting for. The service was phenomenal and so was the food. However, I had to give it a 4 star because they couldn't make me extra crispy hash browns. When inquiring about why that was the case. The answer I got was because they make the hash browns all in one batch. Maybe I'm being a little extra but why can't you take a small portion of that batch out and then let it cool for just a little bit longer? But hey, I'm not a chef and a restaurant so I don't know how the cooking process is at any restaurant."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! Awesome food! Awesome service! I had the Banana Cream French toast which tasted like a perfectly sweet but not too sweet dream. The scrambled eggs were so light and fluffy. Better than I could make. Yum."}
{"text":"Do you know what they have at Butterfields?

They have a Belgian Waffle (and I capitalize because it's important here) with crumbled up Bacon in the waffle...in the waffle!

They cook the bacon into the waffle right in the old waffle iron:)

Well...next to a bacon filled old fashioned donut, this may the closest we get to a perfect ten in \"food combinations/breakfast division\":)

The Beautiful Carin and I needed a little sustenance on Sunday morning and found ourselves reasonably close to Butterfields (actually, we were right down the street from the Breakfast Club, but who needs that cluster:)

We hadn't been to Butterfields for several months and the time was ripe for \"revisit\" so I could \"score the review\":)

I'm pretty glad we did!

Summertime is probably a better time to get your Butterfields fix...on a Sunday in January the wait gets a little crazy...north of an hour with a line of Dame Edna lookalikes standing at the counter asking if their table is ready because they're sure they felt their pager go off...it didn't really go off...just the friction of Teflon against titanium in their hip replacements every time they shift their considerable bulk:)

This past Sunday, the wait at 12:30 was zero minutes:)

Butterfields is technically a \"chain\"...three locations separated from each other by thousands of miles...they don't feel like a chain:)

They have a bunch of nice touches at Butterfields...a big mechanical juicer where they feed crates of oranges in the top and fresh juice comes out the bottom...heavy cream for the coffee (a truly delightful \"bloom\" of cream when you pour it in the coffee:), Vermont maple syrup and other nice, high quality touches:)

The menu runs from a selection of Benedict's (including the Bubba, with gravy and sausage instead of Canadian Bacon and Hollandaise) to a selection of assorted Dutch Babies and Apple pancakes.

I've tried a bunch of these tasty little treats and they are serious health food (by which I mean that if you eat here too often, you will need to see your healthcare professional...seriously:)

But, back to the aforementioned Waffle...you order that, a side of sausage, two sunnyside up eggs ( which you slide onto your buttered waffle)...syrup the whole thing and eat until the pee stick says you're approaching a diabetic coma:)

Carin had a nice breakfast, too! 

Some sort of omelet! 

She said it was good, but I forget anything else after the sugar shock took me down:)"}
{"text":"Have not had a bad experience here. Service is quick and friendly and the food is consistently outstanding. The only negative is the wait. But it is worth it. And I wish it were open for dinner!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here this afternoon for a brunch and I must say I'm highly impressed. The owner is an amazing guy and greeted our table and chatted with us since we were fellow Greeks. Everything that came out of the kitchen from the coffee to the entrees were incredibly cooked and presented. I am usually not a super big fan of breakfast restaurants but this one is definitely one to check out for a delicious meal. Also, the decor of the restaurant is open and inciting with sleek modern touches to everything. If you're looking for some amazing breakfast or lunch food, come here!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Scottsdale! 
I always get the one or two egg it's big enough to split of you get 2. I make sure I get cheese grits recently on my last trip there this past Sunday we met a waitress from South African her name is Bronwin and she was absolutely amazing we talked and talked about LA and about Africa and she was on point with everything we needed food wise . I just love the family feel here sometimes the wait can be 30-45 mins but it goes fast and it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Five stars for the food.  Waiters Stanley and Willy Rock the place.

The Owner Has a big attitude problem!!! 
He used to be so nice.  He Couldn't care less about the customers  anymore."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so I really enjoyed this place.  They have delicious fresh squeezed orange juice which is required for any breakfast, and some excellent pancakes.  I enjoyed the pumpkin french toast quite a bit, but it was really rich, as you can imagine.  The pancakes I tasted blew away what you would normally find at a standard breakfast joint.  The coffee wasn't anything special, but I wasn't expecting anything more than the average there.  The price is a bit high for breakfast, but it's in Snotsdale so most frequent patrons won't notice anyway.  I would come back here again for sure."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom last week. It serves normal breakfast food like pancakes, french toast, eggs. It's a big restaurant. They were crowded but we were able to get seated right away. I ordered the French toast. It was great. The syrup that they have is one of the best I've ever tasted. I also ordered the cheesy grits. They were so cheesy and creamy. My mom ordered the oatmeal. She liked it. The waitstaff was nice. They checked in on us every 5-10 minutes to see if everything was okay."}
{"text":"I love this place. My family and I come here often because their soup is great and the Monte Cristo is the best I've ever had.  The Monte Cristo has been removed from the menu, but they'll usually make it for you anyway. The only downside is that the wait for a table is usually long (15-45 minutes), especially during the winter months when all the midwestern \"snowbirds\" arrive."}
{"text":"Great food, the eggs were too fluffy though, made them taste like they hadn't been cooked all the way. Our waitress had the personality of a wall, she was not friendly at all. But good atmosphere and good everything else.

Oh and almost $5 for a large juice- um no thanks, since he small is like 6oz im not spending $5 on probably 12oz."}
{"text":"On-point service and on-point food! I swear we were asked if we wanted coffee refills every 10 minutes we were there- now THAT is superb service. Furthermore, the food options are phenomenal, both for your savory and sweet cravings.

Insider Tip: Get here before 8:30 A.M. I heard the line is crazy past that early time frame."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with the family, i love the food and the service ,and my favorit waitress Eica,Since i havent seen her there ,i probally wont go back."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. The baked potato omelette is amazing and their fresh squeezed orange juice is the perfect way to wake up. I'm gluten free and I tried their pancakes the last time I went and I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious they were! Butterfields is great."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times in the last few years. I kept forgetting to write a review and if the place was any good. So, I'm finally writing the review, based off of my experience the last time I went.
The place has been remodeled since the last time I came in, they seem too be trying to keep up with the other \"hipster-scottsdale-class\" breakfast places around Scottsdale. One of the problem I usually have with this place is, the fact it takes so long to get it in that usually the people that I'm with don't want to go there. Thankfully, that was not an issue this time, albeit it was a Tuesday morning.
The food was excellent & a much better value than some of the other places around Scottsdale like, Hash Kitchen. I got the Mexican Omlet with a side of Hash browns & cinnamon roll pancakes. Everything was excellent & only cost $13 for everything, which is less than you would pay for a few pancakes al a carte at the Hash Kitchen.
I will definitely be coming back here in the future. The only downside to this place is the wait, which can be extremely long on weekends. Other than that, Butterfield's is one of the best Breakfast places I've been to in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best breakfast reataurant in town. They do everything right!! Always fresh and well prepared quality food! 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Really great food! The wait is worth it as it is a very popular restaurant. I ate there twice while visiting family and and can tell you when I go back I will eat there again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot if you have a big group and kids.  Nice menu selections and fresh squeezed OJ.  Coffee is decent.  Food is consistently tasty."}
{"text":"I've visited Butterfield's on several occasions, and while I am never let down by the food or the service, I always feel a bit rushed.  Yes, I understand that there are people waiting for tables, and the quicker you can get me out of there and the next table in, the more money you will make, but what happened today was a real disappointment.  

My daughter and I stopped in for breakfast at 9:15 this morning.  The restaurant was only about 3/4 full so we were seated immediately.  We placed our drink order moments after we were seated, and as soon as our server returned with our drinks we ordered our breakfast.  Our food was served within five minutes.  Everything was prepared exactly as we had requested.  

We were still enjoying our meal when the bus person stopped by to clear some dishes.  He attempted to take my (two year old) daughter's plate because she was not actively eating it.  I stopped him and said she was still working on it.  He also asked if he could clear my side order of pancakes.  There was still half of the order of on my plate and we had only been eating for about seven minutes.  I told him I was not finished, and he left our table empty handed.  

About seven more minutes passed before he returned.  My daughter had eaten every last drop of her kid's chocolate chip pancakes and strip of bacon so he cleared her plate.  He again tried to clear my pancakes plate, despite the fact that I was holding my fork in my hand.  I told him, once more, that we were still working on them.  

Our server came by and offered me another iced tea.  I accepted and asked that she bring the check and a small box for my leftovers.  She returned with the tea, check and take out box moments later.  I told her I needed to take my daughter to the restroom, but that we would be coming back right back to finish up as I handed her my debit card to pay.

When we returned to the table it had been completely cleared.  My daughter's orange juice ($3.29 for a kid's size) which was nearly full was gone, as was the untouched iced tea my server had just brought and my side of pancakes.  The take out box with the remainder of my corned beef hash and eggs was sitting on the edge if the table with my check waiting to be signed.  The table had already been set for the next guests.  Unbelievable...We had only been in the restaurant for 31 minutes (from the time we entered the door until we came back to our cleared table)!

If you removed the obnoxious, overzealous busser from this equation our meal would have been four stars.  It was delicious.  Our server was friendly enough.  She made sure our needs were met and checked on us often.  

I will likely return to give Butterfield's another chance, but if I am EVER rushed like I was today, you can rest assured I will not return.  I hope to be able to update this review with a couple extra stars soon!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here almost every weekend. We also make it a point to bring out of towers here when they come to visit. It's a nice big restaurant that's very clean. We love all the food. They have a great system/rotation so things are always moving smoothly and the wait isn't too long. Everyone is friendly and professional. Coffee is strong but not bitter. delicious pancakes."}
{"text":"Yummy! Southern boy I loved yhe grits! The salmon scramble was Perfectly made. Hash browns crispy not oily! Pancakes were delightful! Fresh squeezed OJ and even the cold water on the table was yummy!

Great service!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is probably one of my FAVORITE places to get breakfast!

My friend brought me here for the first time a few years ago and I loved it! Everything on the menu is amazing! The last time I went I got the Banana nut bread french toast. It was delicious. One of my other favorites is their corned beef hash. But my other recommendations? Everything! I've also tried their Pecan pancakes which are delicious. I really want to try their crepes and that fried egg bagel next time I'm in or even their lunch menu sounds really good. 

The only downer for me is that it's quite far for me, but well worth the drive! &  If you go on the weekends there's going to be a wait since it does get pretty busy. I might be writing another review for it once I try their lunch menu. =)"}
{"text":"Ok food...But they won't seat you unless your entire party is present...We had three of us ready.  Money spends the same.  The other two arrived within 5 minutes.  It was a Wednesday morning.  10:30.  We'll just find another place."}
{"text":"My wife and I could tell this place gets busy for breakfast because of the large waiting area inside the restaurant, so thank goodness we came for a really late brunch.  Breakfast is served tip 3pm.  I ordered the California Scramble with the hash browns and pancakes.  The whole meal was delicious!  The pancakes we're a little on the small side for a two stack though, but very yummy.  My wife ordered the Bacon and Mushroom skillet and that was very tasty as well.  She also had the hash browns and pancakes.  We had our 20 month old son eat our food which were both good sized portions for breakfast.  This place will be a definite breakfast return spot!"}
{"text":"With the possible exception of a fabulous bed & breakfast in Germany, this was the BEST breakfast out ever! The Wildberry French toast was... can't find a word. Picture this: Two thick perfectly done pieces of French toast with mascarpone oozing out from between, a pretty drizzle of the cheese and Wildberry sauce on the top, and a serving of lovely fresh berries on the side. I'm kind of sad that they're closed now, because I could actually do it all over again!

My husband had the Country Biscuits & Gravy and it was much lighter than this dish usually is, and the seasoning was perfectly balanced - not overdone. And it's true what they said about the scrambled eggs - FLUFFY! They did raise the bar for scrambled eggs!

Add fresh squeezed OJ and coffee and great service, and we were truly happy campers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Melt in your mouth pancakes, huge omelettes and great service.  This is a must stop if you are a breakfast food lover."}
{"text":"Wow!  This is by far the best breakfast place in town.  I have been to many and most of them are good.  This one is amazing.  So far, everything I have tried there has been surprizingly better than I expected.  The pancakes are very tasty and I am not a pancake fan at all (I swiped some from my wife).  I love a good corn beaf hash, and they have some amazing variations.  I like the Irish benedict which is benedict over corn beaf hash... wow!  Their version of hash browns is wonderful, their crepes are great, even the grits, if you like grits, are very nicely done.  I have not done lunch but we have been to breakfast many times and it is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"It is so strange that of all the meals you eat why breakfast seems to be the one that always seems to be screwed up most often.

Well my fellow Yelpers Butterfields is a breakfast place that always seems to get the food right.  

I am a poached egg fan so you can only imagine the trouble I run into when eating breakfast out.  Not here!

Eggs done perfectly
Sausage very tasty
Pancakes are the right size and not the kind you have to keep adding syrup to as you eat them (you know the kind I mean)
Mickey Mouse Pancake is always a hit with the little man.
Fresh OJ... YUM!

As you can read and as the stars indicate I am indeed a fan and will be here often!

Wait one last thing you will have a wait on the weekend but they give you the pagers so you can sit outside with the fam and you know you will not be skipped."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we were Very impressed! We were sat down quickly and our server was super friendly! The menu was extensive with something for everyone! I ordered the wild berry crepes and my boyfriend had the chocolate chip waffles with biscuits and gravy, Canadian bacon, and ham steak. My boyfriend also LOVED their chocolate milk! Our food was served in about 5 minutes, we couldn't believe it! Everything was delicious! We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Okay full disclosure: I'm a HUGE brunch snob! Let's call it what it is.. I'm a food snob in general but more so with brunch. I had heard some very good things about this place from a friend of mine and my expectations were super high to begin with. But after having eaten here, I can safely say that the food went above and beyond my expectations. My date arrived a few minutes late and I was promptly served hot coffee while I waited. It's almost impossible to make up your mind about what to order. I kept staring at the menu totally mesmerized by imagining what each of it would taste like. We both finally decided on getting a skillet with pancakes, each. I ordered the New Mexico skillet with scrambled eggs and a side of buttermilk pancakes while my date ordered the corn beef hash with banana cream pancakes. The scrambled eggs were soft fluffy pillows of delicious goodness! This has got to be the best scrambled eggs I've eaten my entire life, by a mile! The lightness of the eggs is almost unreal. The rest of the skillet was quite fantastic too.. They slice their potatoes real thin, so they end up being super crisp. The chorizo was quite fantastic as well and was a really good addition to the already amazing food. I tried the other skillet and banana cream pancakes; and needless to mention, they also knocked it out of the park in the taste department. 

I have never been big on pancakes but these pancakes are something else altogether! Incredibly soft with just a touch of crisp. Absolutely divine! The food here is nothing short of ambrosia. I have heard a great deal about their freshly squeezed orange juice but to be quite honest, I wanted to save up room to stuff my face with as much food as I possibly could. By far, my favorite brunch food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Freakin awesome...from the juicer to the food....it is now a weekly thing btw myself and my friend...We are addicted.....Their OJ is freshly squeezed, service awesome and the food to die for...Its worth it....Pricey but you get what you pay for.....Although their coffee could be better....but its pretty close to perfection soooooo."}
{"text":"Of course, everyone knows how great B's is.The crowds are unbelievable. The staff is extra, extra nice, too. That's why it upset me to see Ted acting so mean over $.50!!! Come on, show respect to your wonderful crew!!"}
{"text":"Driving up to Butterfields, the first thing you'll notice is the crowd out the door. Not unusual for a Saturday or Sunday morning, there will be people waiting both outside and inside the restaurant. The crowd might be large, but thankfully due to the number of seats and the fast-paced staff, you typically won't need to wait more than 15 minutes.

From a pure ratings perspective, Butterfields falls right in the middle of my spots for brunch. I frequent the place because of proximity, convenience and comfort. Butterfields is all about the home-cooked style meal that leaves you happy and your stomach satisfied. There are certainly places that are worse, however if you're looking for a unique or exceptional meal, you may want to look elsewhere. This really isn't a bad thing in Butterfield's case, because I believe they are striving to reach the masses with their food. Of all the menu choices, if you are looking for something a little more unique (at least for the Scottsdale area), try the Dutch Baby, a baked pancake of sorts.

This past visit, I had the chicken scrambler with fruit and potatoes. As with most other breakfast places, the portions are quite large here as well. The flavors overall were good, however one complaint I have was that there was too much filler put into the eggs. A lot of restaurants use milk or cream to make the eggs more fluffy, however in this case there was a little too much added. The eggs tasted a bit diluted.

I'll continue going to Butterfields because of the comfort. I'll continue trying different items on their menu, but I feel confident that it will keep consistent with my experience there. For most, that's really not a bad thing.

[This review is based on my visit on July 27, 2013]"}
{"text":"Brunch is my favorite meal and I've been meaning to try Butterfield's for some time. I finally had the opportunity when I had a friend visit from out of town.  Service started out okay but got much better by the end of our meal.  The food was excellent. The menu was extensive and I'd like to go back and try every menu item -- no joke. They serve fresh cream with the coffee which is always a win. And OMG the pancakes were so good.  Everything tasted great. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm very hesitant about writing this review.  Butterfield's used to be our place.  Every Saturday morning we'd load the family up and go there.  Not so much anymore.  They have a wide variety menu items.  If you are into the exotic pancake they've got some for your taste buds including Dutch baked pancakes that are amazing.  The fresh squeezed orange juice is out of this world.  What's the problem?  The service has slid off a cliff over the past year.  I can live with the wacky filipino waiters who are way too friendly but lately there is a collection of young girls that can't seem to get an order correct and can't seem to get anything done in a timely manner.  Last week I sat there for 15 minutes before anyone asked me if I'd like coffee.  This with an active and hungry 2 year old.  The place was half full and there appeared to be plenty of servers on hand."}
{"text":"Butterfield's is one of my favorite breakfast spots in the valley. It's good every time. You get a lot of food for your money, so come ready to eat, or with a friend that is willing to split a dish with you. The service is generally very fast and friendly. The place is almost always packed and you will almost always have to wait...awhile. It's worth it, in my opinion. 

The only thing that would make it better for me is if it were more local, sustainable, and had amazing coffee. You can't have it all, I suppose."}
{"text":"The wait is always worth it, the breakfast is the best in Scottsdale. The food is always cooked perfectly and tastes amazing. Although they are always busy, the service staff is friendly and attentive and never lets the drinks go empty. If you are in the area, plan ahead and check it out."}
{"text":"Well, I don't know if I really need to share my fabulous experience for this well know Breakfast Hot Spot, but... I will.
I have a friend that absolutely loves this place! We live on opposite sides of the Phoenix & this is our 1/2 way spot to meet & visit.
First of all, if this is your first time visiting be prepared for a wait. This is not a quick in & out & on with your day of errands, etc. This is \"I ate a small protein snack-take my time eating breakfast-slow kind of day\" breakfast joint.
They are well know for their fresh squeezed orange juice, sweet pancakes
(my fav are the protein pancakes packed with blueberries, oats, & almonds), & hot chocolate (get it & share it! it's a work of art)."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale over the weekend and heard rave reviews of this place, had to see what the fuss was about and wasn't let down! I had the New Mexico Skillet and my friend got the mexicana omelette - when I asked our server about what I should not miss, she recommended the baby apple. Everything was on point! The baby apple is definitely something you don't want to miss out on! Fluffy, covered with cinnamon and not too sweet.
The atmosphere was great, their layout and decor is well themed and the staff was very cheerful and wore smiles like a fashion trend.
A big shout out to our girl Vesaliki - She made the experience well worth the trip! Funny, charming, she did a great job popping in on us and go above and beyond our expectations! Having people like her in a establishment make customers want to return just for the way she makes you feel welcomed and like family!"}
{"text":"Good enough, the foods good and the service is what you would expect. My plate was alright but the pancakes stole the show.  My wife wasn't impressed with her plate (probably because she didn't order something that came with pancakes)."}
{"text":"One of the best and most consistent places in Scottsdale...Tons of choices all very good served very quickly.  Weekends are busy and unless you go early (before 9am) expect to wait! It can get loud when it is busy but unless you are an old coot you won't find it too bad."}
{"text":"The orange juice is the only good thing.  The food is just plain old breakfast you can get anywhere, except the staff at this place is terrible!  Very unexperienced and rude.  Have been 2 times and decided it was terrible."}
{"text":"Based on most of the reviews, I must have just visited Butterfields on a bad day. I ordered the Bacon Belgian, and tried to order two eggs ala carte to go with it. My server had a difficult time with figuring out how to take the egg order to begin with, and then when, contrary to what I ordered, the eggs came out with runny whites, she took them out and brought me eggs with even the yolk cooked hard. I paid for it, but left pretty disgusted without eating most of the waffle, and only one bite of the eggs.

Looking up their menu on line since my visit, I realize that instead of charging me $6.25 for two eggs any style, my two eggs should have been .99 each since they were to accompany my waffle... That means I was overcharged in the deal on top of the eggs never being correctly prepared.

I made a note to myself not to go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! We always go when we have extra cash because it's a lil more pricey then average breakfast, but well worth it! I always get a smoothie. It's like an hour away from our house so that goes to show how good it is. Definitely worth the drive and the price. Only thing is ask for plastic utensils and cups, their dishes always smell like mildew."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have a sister location Butter's on Via de Ventura which I eat at very often! Same menu, this place is just much larger and is always crazy busy!!!! I love their protein pancakes and usually do the veggie omelette or build your own omelette with feta, spinach, and bacon. They use real ingredients, not those artificial eggs most breakfast spots use. They make all of their sauces and dressings in house and the customer service is fantastic!!! This is one of my favorite breakfast spots and they have inside and outside dining. They can substitute almost anything on the menu and they can accommodate large parties. Even though this place is always crazy busy they are very good at managing their wait times and getting people sat within 20-30 min. Definitely would recommend this place to anyone! Love it!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to have breakfast & the service is excellent. The pancakes are amazing but if you're looking for something healthy they're great at that too.

I have had their french toast and their pancakes and they're both top notch. Lately, I've been eating extremely healthy, so I had an egg white omelet \"made to order,\" and it was amazing.

Only bad thing about this place is that it's so good, you'll definitely have to wait for a table on the weekends, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wonderfully fluffy eggs & omelets. Love their gluten free pancakes, hollandaise sauce & interesting menu items for a breakfast joint (like the loaded baked potato omelet!). The downside? Their syrup is horrible - not real maple syrup but that gross gooey corn syrup stuff. Be like George Costanza & bring your own! Also, I'm a big fan of grits but Butterfield's are TOO creamy. It's like a bowl of hot cream/butter with a few grits sprinkled in."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great. Just A-OK!

Stopped in for breakfast one day while we were in the area. Restaurant is currently being remodeled so the decor was nice in some parts and not so nice in other parts. No biggie. There's lots of seating so the wait isn't too bad, even when you see a crowd standing inside by the hostess stand and outside on the benches.

Staff are all nice and friendly. Service is quick, which is a plus. There's a relatively large selection of hot tea so if you're a tea drinker like me, it's nice. Menu is pretty large but we opted for safer entrees.

I had the veggie omelet with no cheese. It was pretty simple in flavor but light and fluffy. Grits are very rich, very heavy, and very good, but if you're watching your calories, I would skip it as they're probably made with heavy cream. Pancakes are a little dry but nice. Husband had the two egg special (scrambled) with bacon. Bacon was pretty crispy, and the hash browns were crispy and kind of scalloped style - plain flavor, but good. I would opt for the hash browns in the future.

I like the the table has a bunch of condiments for all your needs - Tabasco sauce, maple syrup, ketchup, and everything in between. Prices are reasonable for what you get. If I'm in the area again during breakfast time, I'll probably make another stop in."}
{"text":"This is my go to place about twice a week.
I cannot get out of there without having the Swedish Cakes. The crispy little edge is so yummy. Add some maple syrup. Absolutely awesome. The spinach and gruyere crepes are also one of my favorites but I like to add some chicken to it to give it a little more substance. So good. Expect a wait on the weekends. Goes pretty quick. I love this place!"}
{"text":"First time here. Outstanding to say the least. Dee our server was terrific. We asked what was good and instead of the usual response \"everything\" she told us she loved the cinnamon pancakes. Wow was she right food came out quick, hot and delish. Everything we had was great. Even though it was busy all employees had smiles were friendly and seemed to enjoy working here. Go for the great food enjoy the great atmosphere."}
{"text":"One notch up from ihop and others, as Butterfield is a breakfast chain also.  Pancakes are good, crepes are their specialty, and the OJ is fresh squeezed.  

Reasonably priced, except for crepes which seemed a little high to me.  Long waits during prime hours."}
{"text":"Butterfield's is one of my favorite breakfast spots. The service is fast and the food is delicious. If you want perfectly cooked, light & fluffy omelets look no further. If you haven't been here yet I highly recommend giving them a shot....you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Crepes, dutch baby pancakes, and fresh squeezed o.j. make a sweet, coma-inducing breakfast.  Plus the bacon is thick and crispy! To top it all off there was maple syrup on the table, no cheap buttersworth on the table for this epic breakfast chow down.  This breakfast was so good that I still dream about the huge, eggy dutch baby that was the size of a pie and covered in cinnamon apple slices.  After leaning back, fully satisfied and possibly too full, I noticed that there were winged pats of butter with waffles painted on the ceiling.  Awesome."}
{"text":"More than a dozen trips later... and Butterfields continues to be consitently excellent. We go here almost every single weekend for breakfast, and not once have we had a less than stellar meal; and we've tried just about every damn thing on the menu.

If you go here... ASK FOR WILLIE!!!!! Willie is probably the best breakfast waiter we've ever had... he's always on top of everything, but best of all he's got a contagious happy attitude. If you go there and have him as waiter, It's nearly impossible to leave without a smile on your face. After having him only a couple times, he had already memorized what we order. Now we specifically ask for his section, because I think as diners it's our responsibility to reward good wait staff... it can make all the difference in the world when it comes to your dining experience. 

That is all..."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous breakfast great coffee and the service was phenomenal. We totally eat like pigs it was so good"}
{"text":"Eggs cooked perfectly, pancakes little above average (for plain and syrup), good coffee and very good service!
BUT - ham steak and bacon virtually tasteless. Fruit cup side was also less than ordinary. Hard to kill the flavor pineapple, so that was the best of it...refrigerator stale.

Sorry, but very average and below expectations. Too many other options"}
{"text":"I'm going to cut to the chase and tell you the Belgian Waffle was outstanding! You are probably thinking, why I got Waffles at a Pancake joint, right? To be honest, I was going to order pancakes but judging how they looked from other people's plates, it seemed less appealing!  Kind of plain and boring, if you would.

I had no regrets! The 4-inch diameter waffle was thick, moist, and had enough crisp around the edges! For an additional $2, I opted to add some fresh cut strawberries! Finish it off with some in-house syrup and butter, you got yourself a breakfast of champions! ($8)

As for the Hash Brown, the shredded potatoes were crisped perfectly at the top while the inner part was fresh tasting! ($2)

I washed all that down with a large glass of sweet, yet delicious orange juice!  This was probably the best fresh squeeze I've ever had. ($5)

The meal was not heavy and portioned appropriately to keep you away from an afternoon nap.  

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and operated as efficient as she could as the restaurant was at full capacity. 

All in all, I would rate my experience as mostly positive with one caveat: the wait.  Expect a wait and steep bill!"}
{"text":"Butterfields is breakfast at it's best.  It is the only place that can make better breakfast than me (I make some mean fluffy scrambled eggs and french toast, and the occasional breakfast burrito when I feel like going all out)

Seriously the best breakfast restaurant I've ever been to (it tops a place in Austin I thought could never be topped)

Portions are large and everything is fresh.  They even make their own orange juice (you can see the squeezer in the dining area and the crates of oranges are a convenient decoration and add a wonderful aroma combined with the other breakfasty smells. 

I have tried their omelettes, amazing. California scramble sans the chicken, amazing. French toast, amazing. Pancakes, amazing. Huevos rancheros, to die for.

You can't go wrong at this place. It gets crazy busy on Sundays and you will probably have to wait for a table if you aren't an early bird but SOOOOO worth the wait.

I take all of my out of town friends here, a meal at Butterfields is something I think everyone should have the chance to experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast. Great fresh squeezed juices (orange and grapefruit), good coffee, good pancakes, eggs were perfect. Everything is very well made, good service and overall I will be back. This was my second visit.

The Cajun Chicken Sausage was also quite good, I'd have this again for sure. Nice and spicy."}
{"text":"This is my fav breakfast place in the Valley! I have always had amazing service and great food for a reasonible price. I go here when I have appts in Scottsdale and for some reason the # of appts. in Scottsdale seems to be rising! I love that they give you your drink in a to go cup when you leave. 
I think I've always purchased breakfast here- they are only open till 3pm-but a friend ordered a french dip sandwich today that looked amazing and huge! So I may be a non breakfast diner next visit. The OJ is fresh squeezed, the veggies in the eggs fresh and crisp, and the pancakes cooked to perfection.
The only minor issue I have is there is an upcharge for Vermont Maple Syrup vs. the standard high fructose corn syrup."}
{"text":"Not going to lie about it. I definitely did not look my best going in that morning, neither did my three other breakfast companions. We were in the need of something other than liquid sustenance and after questioning Siri about the nearest pancake or waffle joint, we found ourselves holding a buzzer outside, shielding the sun from our eyes.
There was a line of early birds (also snowbirds) before us, but we waited no more than 10 minutes for a table.
Food filled up our entire table and it was all fantastic. Namesake pancakes, a breakfast burrito, mexicana omelette, cajun chicken sausage, eggs, bacon, fresh squeezed orange juice and the best hash browns ever. They're not the shredded kind of hash brown or the home fries type. My best guess is parboiled, sliced and then placed on the flat top to get nice and crisp. They're the best hash browns around by far! I'm not normally a pancake person but I definitely was into those pancakes. This place definitely provided the sustenance we were looking for. Enough that we went out and did it all over again."}
{"text":"I live in GA but frequent AZ a few times a year and one of my top breakfast spots is Butterfield's. The food - excellent. The service - impeccable. The atmosphere - cozy."}
