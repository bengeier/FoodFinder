{"text":"A great place to go with people who don't necessarily like sushi.  

For those that do like sushi, they have a decent sushi offering, with a sushi bar and table service, including a couple of areas for larger groups of people.

For people who don't like sushi, their teriyaki steak is incredible. They also have teriyaki chicken which I haven't tried yet.

The combo meals are excellent with generous portions. I had teriyaki beef, a sushi combo, seaweed salad, picked crab and noodle salad, tempura combo (shrimp and veggies) and miso soup."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tokyo Garden for about 19 or so years now. One of the wait staff, a balding guy has been there since the beginning. Also one of the sushi chefs. It's fairly reasonable, and the food is quite tasty."}
{"text":"We ordered a Ebi sunomo which I typically enjoy. Although I can't say anything bad about the sunomo, I unfortunately cant say anything good. 
It's the same bland story for the Tamago, Tako, Gyu, Tempura roll and the Spicu Tuna roll. They were all very plain and tasteless. 
Sorry, but there are way, way better Sushi places in Calgary. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Tokyo Garden for a long time.  Their fish is consistently fresh and tasty.  Their sushi size is perfect, not too big and not too small.

Their baked oysters with the house special sauce are to die for.  But sometimes the oysters are too tiny.

In term of hot dishes, I really enjoy their Tonkatsu Don.  Very yummy."}
{"text":"A good, relatively cheap stand-by when you need a sushi fix. The sashimi has always been fresh, but I particularly enjoy the hot pots: the sukiyaki hot pot is a great deal, with side salad and tempura veggies for $20. A special treat is one that Angelo showed us: order one or two raw quail eggs from the sushi list, dump them into the broth and let sit. The heat will cook the egg and give the sauce an extra bit of oomph. Thanks Ang!"}
{"text":"They offer fresh and high-quality sushi at fairly average prices for Calgary.  Their miso soup was AMAZING!  Next time I go, I'll need to try some other dishes like Steve and Bernard recommend, but I'll have a hard time avoiding that sushi menu.

There are places downtown that are as good, but for Calgary's suburbs, this is a great place!

If you go for sushi and also order alcohol, I can see this place getting into the \"spendy\" range (over $30 per person).  Otherwise, you could easily get in and out for $20-$30.

To get here, you have to go south on MacLeod Trail to the Superstore / Boston Pizza entrance.  Then, turn right and come way back up toward Southland.  Go past the Telvent building on your left; Tokyo Garden is below the Colt building."}
