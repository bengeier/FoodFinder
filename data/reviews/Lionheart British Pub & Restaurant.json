{"text":"Great pub. Going to check out the Fleetwood Mac tribute on Oct 25. They've had rave reviews and they're based in Mississauga. Band is Fleetwood Mix"}
{"text":"Pub situated in the northwest corner of Mississauga. The pub food here is quite good. Trivia and karaoke nights here are quite crowded so come early if you want to take part or to grab a pint or two. A great local spot for people in Meadowvale and those who live in Milton."}
{"text":"Loved the food Waitress not so much Mixed up the drink order,the bill and one of my friends got the 'hair flip and eye roll'."}
{"text":"Fantastic wings! They are truly amazing. Get the Guiness BBQ Sauce on them.  Service is good as well. I would recommend this Irish Pub for anyone in the area looking for pub fare.  This is a good go-to spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to bring a large group.  We recently went there with a girls hockey team and had an excellent time and were quite impressed with the reception we received.  Upon entering the restaurant they had a TV screen just inside the door welcoming our team with our team logo, which was quite impressive since we never gave the owner the logo, he went out of his way to find our team's website and download the logo.  He also had our tables adorned with balloons in our team colours and, as it was Easter weekend, he had purchased chocolate bunnies that he gave to each girl.  Great food, excellent service, and a very good selection of beer.  Definitely would recommend this place for a large group or even just a evening out with family or friends."}
{"text":"Lionheart has been around for some time.  It's great having a true neighbourhood pub within walking distance!  The food is good, with all the usual pub offerings. They've also added more \"Gastro Pub\" selections which are more upscale than your typical burgers and fish 'n chips.  I'm particularly fond of Shepherd's Pie, and was disappointed over a year ago as they decided to use lamb instead of beef, and I don't eat lamb.   Tonight, I discovered they've returned to their original recipe.  Yay!    We enjoyed a three-course \"Taste of Britain\" prix fixe menu tonight (on until Nov. 25/12.)  The potato, leek and bacon soup was very filling, the Shepherd's (Cottage) pie yummy and the sticky toffee pudding was warm and sweet.  Add to that a free pint glass (and loyalty points) and it was a great meal!"}
{"text":"They have a good selection of beers, the breakfast is good (and cheap). The Chicken Focaccia is good, stay away from the sweet potato fries though, last time I had them they weren't fully cooked."}
{"text":"very friendly staff, good food, and lots of food and drink specials all through the week. I especially enjoy the poutine and wings. i like that theres security at the door on the weekends and clean bathrooms. This bar can get really loud sometimes."}
{"text":"I don't know why it's taken me this long to write a review to a place I can honestly say is my second home. From the food to the service (shout out to Renatta and Dan) and then the atmosphere, everything about this place is awesome. Trivia night and karaoke nights? C'mon now who doesn't like watching people sing on stage for their own entertainment. Highly recommend the Guinness sausage, it's soft and succulent and definitely Guinness infused."}
{"text":"Went out for our anniversary and thought we would try out this place since we love a good pub. We were not disappointed in the least. The atmosphere was a perfect blend of classic British pub and upgraded restaurant for the modern age. I saw on the menu that the classic fish and chips only came in a 2 piece or 3 piece. I went for the 2 piece only to be told the third piece was free today. So obviously I had to go for it. Our orders came and we were in heaven. The best pub food in the area by far. You can also join the loyalty program and gain bonuses or gifts...how awesome. We had 3 people helping us. A true team that knows how to look after their patrons. A fantastic experience that I just can't say enough about."}
{"text":"I used to visit this place more often when I worked nearby. It's in the far northwest corner of Mississauga where there's not necessarily going on, but at least this place is there for some neighbourhood charm and there's a genuine 'Cheers' vibe of belonging for regulars here.  The food is honestly not too much to write home about, but it does the job. The Guinness-BBQ wings and great beer selection help bring this up to a 4. The staff here always do a terrific job as well.  The trivia and Karaoke nights do really well here, and gives people a place for something to do and unwind. They also have a decent Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"The Lionheart is a great local pub with exceptionally great staff.  We recently hosted 55 people for a Baptism Reception (yes - a baptism at a pub) and it was a perfect Sunday afternoon.  The manager, Adam, was so easy and friendly to work with and attentive to all of our needs.  He took the time to understand the mood we were trying to achieve and catered to everything.  They transformed the section off area beautifully with white linens, balloons and even a slide show on the TVs.  Adam's keen understanding of our families, time of day and how to set up an event was absolutely spot on - he knew exactly what to order, how much and how to pace things. All the food was great, staff was super accommodating and all our guest had a great time.  Great place for family event or group gathering. Don't hesitate to give Adam a call for your next event."}
{"text":"I did a breakfast takeout which was good. My only issue is that I was charged an amount different from what it is on the website. After bringing it to the notice of the server, I got nothing more than an apology. Please update your website when you'll change prices because it is not right for customers to pay a price for something that is different from what they expected to."}
{"text":"We had been here for dinner before so when it was time to plan our daughter's 19th birthday we approached Lionheart to arrange a night out for her and some friends. We sat down with Adam and planned out the perfect evening with shareable platters, pizza, and drinks. He even went above and beyond by providing not only decorations, including balloons, but he also put together a special slideshow  to commemorate her special day that ran on a lot of the TVs in the restaurant. I'm not sure if it had been prearranged, but the band in that particular Saturday night even sang happy birthday to my daughter as the cake was wheeled out. (They allow you to bring in your own cake and only charge a small amount to slice and serve.) We will definitely consider Lionheart again for any future celebrations. Thank you to Adam and your staff for a wonderful event."}
{"text":"Great local pub. Cozy, friendly and great service. They have been around for a while and the food is consistently good. Great place to hang with friends."}
{"text":"As a preface, this review is based ONLY on the Big English Breakfast menu item. First of all, they're not messing around with portion sizes. When they say big they mean big. I went there quite hungry and still wasn't able to finish everything on the plate. You get the impression with this dish that it was designed by someone who really knows and appreciates a good hearty breakfast. There's enough meat there for the most insatiable carnivore (the haggis is delicious - the best way I can describe it is like meat butter), the eggs are cooked perfectly, and even the toast was quite tasty. All of the side trimmings are very solid. The service was super friendly and the environment was very relaxed. Overall this is one of the tastiest breakfasts I've had and definitely my favourite pub-style one in Mississauga. I'll definitely be coming back and I'm looking forward to trying the other stuff on the menu too!"}
{"text":"What a great place for dinner and drinks!  The night we came it was Karaoke night. The place was hoping!  Just a fun bunch of people drinking and singing. The drinks come quite fast once ordered. The food takes a lot longer. Expect to wait. Once it comes it's typical pub fare. The fried pickles are one of a kind and a must try. It's a cozy and friendly place. Happy to we found it. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A deliciously cold Boddington's on tap and the haggis stack made for an excellent lunch. The menu had good variety and offered something for everyone. The preparation of food was excellent and the quality was certainly there. The dining room was bright, airy and very comfortable."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. First impressions were a little dark and dismal. The seats, wallpaper, and carpet seem to be in disrepair. They also have British television shows playing on various tiny tvs scattered across the restaurant, even in restroom. I didn't mind either way.  The tables must be unnaturally far away from the benches, I found that I was hunched over to try to reach my plate. Our male coworker ordered coffee and the mug was served with two big lipstick prints on either side. It made me kinda of nervous about the cleanliness of my coffee mug. The staff was good and the food was very good. We followed the waiters suggestion and all got the sirloin burger. It was very delicious.   I just wish the atmosphere matched the good food."}
{"text":"After a late night, we ventured to Lionheart for brunch. The website was a little off, saying breakfast until 3pm and we arrive just after 2pm, when the breakfast actually ends.  Our waitress was really cheerful and was able to convince the kitchen to give our table of five breakfast with steaming hot coffee and tea.  It's a nice pub - I'm hoping that the next time I come back into town I'll be able to catch the band that plays there since everyone has been talking about them lately..."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day (last minute plans) and have also been here a few times before. Food is okay - usual pub fare. Pretty good selection of drinks. The atmosphere is pretty chill. Today was especially good since they had live music, and the performer was great. Sometimes hard to get attention of wait staff, even on days that aren't too busy. Noise level depends on the number of people there (obviously), but usually it's loud enough that you don't feel awkward but quiet enough that you can still talk."}
{"text":"Typical for an older crowd but the place has decent service, good food, live bands on weekends."}
{"text":"This pub hosted a dinner for a group I was travelling with from st. Louis, There ladies and a pot. The restaurant is extremely nice looking, the service was excellent and the food was delicious. We were served by Jackie and she did an excellent job waiting our table and making sure everyone was satisfied. When our motorcoach pulled up tho let us off to enter the restaurant one of the neighbor business owners ran out of her business screaming at our driver about where she parked, telling her she needed to move although she was parked in an open area. The owner of the Lionheart Pub immediately came out and calmed down the other business owner and allowed our motorcoach driver to remain in her parked location until we all were able to get off of the business. The owner of the Lionheart Pub wss excellent in how he handled the situation and we were treated with totally respect during our visit there. Thank you Lionheart British Pub and thank you Jackie for your excellent service. Mari G."}
{"text":"As mentioned, this pub is a great addition to the neighbourhood.  Excellent place to watch sports.  They have a great selection of beers - particularly English and Belgian beers.  We've eaten there several times and haven't been disappointed.  They offer both the traditional pub-type fare (the burgers in particular are very good) as well as more gourmet-type meals - including some with beer pairing recommendations.  The roast beef dinner is very good, although I wish they hadn't switched the yorkshire pudding to a stilton yorkshire, as I don't like blue cheeses.  Desserts are very good too.  I recommend the cheesecake"}
{"text":"Our primary reason for visiting the Lionheart on Tuesday was for the pub trivia. Was always planning to get some food and a drink as well, but was put off by the insert into a trivia answer sheet indicating there was a minimum spend of $10 per person on food or $25 per person on food and drinks. Ordered the bacon cheeseburger, and a pint. For being as busy as it was, the food came out relatively quickly. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed by the burger. The patty was definitely cooked from frozen and terribly under seasoned. The portion size of fries was also lacking. Those in my party were similarly dissatisfied with their meals (personal nachos & fish and chips). Though we enjoyed the trivia, the quality of the food and of the trivia prize ($10 dollar coupon to be used on future visit, on food only, excluding trivia nights), ensured we wouldn't be back to defend our crown."}
