{"text":"Great place so far. Waiting for the grand opening as we speak. I'll update in a few. The staff seem very nice and the layout looks great. There is a lot of products and appliances inside the store itself.

UPDATE - I fear the this location has become too mainstream even though it just opened. The prices are high. For the people that want to come and get some cheap and affordable home improvement items, this isn't the place. Maybe because they just opened, but they need to work on their pricing. $10 for a single candle stick, $180 for a scratched tiny cabinet. I'm gonna stay away for a while and see if these are inflated prices for the opening..."}
{"text":"Ok..... I know the restore is out of control with pricing everywhere else so I thought I would give the new location a shot. Smaller, yes......product selection, about what you would expect......prices, OMG!  A Samsung dryer (used I might add) for $375?  Are you guys nuts?  I can go get a new one or a scratch and dent from Lowes WITH a warranty.  What are you guys doing?  I think I am done.  It used to be funny but what a waste of time. I wish I could give negative stars."}
{"text":"This store is clean and well organized, but it's always empty! I imagine this is because the prices are incredibly steep.

I stop in here only when I'm in the area, and I am always shocked by the prices they have on the home goods items - dishes, vases, artwork, books, etc. Today I picked up a paperback book and it was tagged at $5.99?!? A small mirror was tagged at $12.00. The home goods prices are similar to what you can expect to find at TJ Maxx, Target, Marshalls, or At Home. I find this wild seeing as this is a second hand store. 

The furniture prices are similar - today a single barstool was priced at $200.00, which is more expensive than a similar barstool I saw brand new in At Home an hour later. Area rugs were $150 and up. The people doing the pricing here do not seem to know the difference between crap furniture from Walmart and solid wood from Pottery Barn - all pieces are priced similarly. 

Staff are friendly and store is clean."}
