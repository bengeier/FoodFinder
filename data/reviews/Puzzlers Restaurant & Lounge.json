{"text":"Clean, reasonably priced and nice staff. That, coupled with the fact that Puzzlers employes those with disabilities, makes it a treat.   Full bar is nice.  Menu is traditional. It is a good place."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!  Very sexy bartender Brian is the best! Can't wait to come in again...."}
{"text":"Puzzlers is a high quality bar.   It has a high quality owner. It has a high quality staff. But most of all, it has a high quality purpose...to help those with autism find employment.   Now, here is the thing...the food is very, very good. This is bar food done better."}
{"text":"Food continues to be good, but one waitress cannot handle the whole place. Had to leave without breakfast, after 20 minutes of NO attention."}
{"text":"Ordered take out recntly... Fish sandwiches are HUGE! The sandwices are delicious too! Everything was done right! We will be returning for a dine in experience!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. They have fresh cut fries ( could've been a little crispier), house made dressings, homemade croutons, and homemade soup. I tried the Reuben which was pretty good. They grilled the sandwich, which I feel like a lot of places don't do. I like mine spicy and they have wing sauce and Frank's hot sauce! I got potato cakes as a side / appetizer. They were pretty good, but were more like hash browns. My only two complaints were the service was a little slow, but it was busy, and you have to go through the bar area to get to the main seating area. The bar area is smoking friendly, which is a pretty big negative in my book. The seating area is a bit cramped with seats bumping up against each other. Overall I'd probably give this place a 3.5, but they are doing good things here."}
{"text":"This bar is super cool! Trivia night was awesome! It is every other Thursday with bar bingo in between! Jenna is super cool! And will shoot the \"sh!t\" in between orders! They have a parking lot, corn hole, pool and darts! Its hard to find a spot on Walnut street w all of them. Smoking in the bar and porch is a great deal for smokers. Porch has a \"backyard\" feel to it. Think cook out!             EDIT: Watched a big guy ( w tat sleeves) sitting at the bar drinking with an old guy drinking some liquor (whiskey presumably ) kick the trivia vendor out. Watched the bartender get \"locked\" more like \"couldnt open the door\" in the bathroom while it happened.   Recap 10/10 would come back for Jenna   1/10 Guests can kick out vendors? Guests can harass employees? Made other patrons leave. Made my group uncomfortable. Late night (10pm) friends showed up. Its a shame thought this could be a hang out. The only redeeming quality was jenna."}
{"text":"Rudeness. I stopped in once to ask to use their phone during an emergency. There were a total of 3 people in the place: the bartender, an obnoxious patron, and what I took to be it's owner. I knew none of these folks but was demeaned and insulted by both the owner and the patron, who made a unnecessary and unfounded slant against a very good friend of mine. I wouldn't eat their food, drink a drink, or patronize that place if the stuff was free. I'd soil myself before even using their toilet. A polite no would have sufficed in place of such arrogance and disregard. Wish zero  was an option."}
{"text":"Service is terrible!  We sat out on the patio for 10 minutes without bring recognized---had to go into the bar and ask for service, even tho a male waiter passed us 3 times while he served others on patio! Food is not bad but do not use a 1/2 off coupon---they have all kinds of exceptions which makes it difficult to reap the full benefit---we lost 100%.  Parking is also bad---must park only in rear of building! JJH"}
