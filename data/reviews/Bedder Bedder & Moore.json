{"text":"I'm a Charlotte native and have been coming here for years!
Such a great menu selection...of course I have my favorites.  Every time I bring new friends here, they always want to come back

Enjoy complimentary soup with meal!  Friendly staff makes it a win all around! 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"I placed an order on 10/10/14 around 9:40am,  using the Paypal (eat24) app on my phone. I been reading the reviews and some are good and some are not, so I decided to try it out. I got to the store at 10:10am and I told them I had placed an order and I was picking it up. I gave them my name and I had to wait 5 minutes, I could tell they forgot to do my order which was the Char-broiled caesar salad, because they were asking me what I wanted in it, when I had already specified online. My time for pick-up was 10:05am

I waited and after 5 minutes someone from the kitchen gave me my food. I went home and when I opened the foam container, all I had was a Big Tortilla Bowl filled with bad lettuce(practically brown) up to the top and just a few pieces of tomatoes, 4 croutons and ONLY, I repeat ONLY 4 tiny strips of Chicken, they weren't like Chicken tender strips, all I had was  4 strips of chicken which looked like they pulled from the breast.  

My total was $10.11 for this salad, which I didn't mind at first, but this is pathetic. I would stick to Subway's Salads around the corner, even they have fresher lettuce."}
{"text":"After eating here for lunch numerous times today I finally got a chance to eat breakfast. The food and service are AMAZING!! Great size portions for the price and the food is always fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"This place is tucked in the back of small shopping center on Montford. I drove by this place several times a week for years and never noticed it. I stopped in one day and it is my new favorite lunch place. They have an excelent selection of top notch sandwiches and if you dine in you get a free cup of soup. I've had a few pitas and was less than impressed, but other than those everything I've had was really good. 

During lunch it gets really busy with mostly moms and older couples. During this time the waitstaff, while always friendly, seems to get overwhelmed.

On nice days they have a few tables outside at which you can sit and enjoy your lunch. And after lunch you can go get dessert at TCBY."}
{"text":"Bought a deal for this place on a website, had never been but wanted to try. At the end of the meal which I might add, was just a typical tuna sandwich that I could have made at home for half the price, they told me \"the person with the phone to scan your deal barcode is off today.\"  I asked them if they could write down the confirmation number and code, since it said ON the deal that that number was all you needed and they said, \"we don't think so.\" No effort to resolve the problem, no effort to follow up, no thought to post a sign about them not accepting dealsavers that day, NO worries about me ever going back there.  I don't need bad service and mediocre food!!"}
{"text":"I know they're known for their catering, but thus place us a great sandwich shop if you need to eat and run.  Huge menu.  They're great about allowing you to customize ingredients, too (swapping bread for wrap, etc).

I ordered a chicken salad wrap to go.  Delicious.  I was in and out within 4 minutes.  Loved it.  Prices and portions are reasonable, too.

Next time:  Dagwood!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best lunch spots in S Charlotte, fantastic sandwiches, huge portions, friendly service and free homemade soup with every order. Some of the best sweet tea in Charlotte. 

Fine for informal business lunches (3-4 people) fills up quick during peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"Soup, sandwich and chips. 8 bucks. Pretty damn good for Charlotte. Soup is always great. Except that one he put grits in that time. He's like the \"Soup Nazi\". I imagine he's nicer though. All kinds of different flavors you'd never think of. I loved the French Onion Barley. Fabulous. Had the New York Reuben soup today. Wonderful. The sandwiches always fill you up. I've only had the Chicken Bacon Cheddar and the Corned Beef and Swiss but I order them again and again. The waitresses are very friendly and attentive too."}
{"text":"Had one of many lunches here today and it was great as always.  I had the chicken salad pita and it was awesome.  Also, they have renovated the whole place. It looks and feels nice."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot if you're in the area. Just make sure you're in there before 3! Wide range of sandwiches and salads to suit any pallet.

Free homemade soup on a cold rainy ugly day will make any person happy I should think. Today's soup was creamy chicken noodle. Yes please and YUM!!! 

Ordered the Reuben this time around- keeping with the theme of eating warm delicious things on this gray afternoon. Solid choice. Nice, hot buttery marble rye with lean corned beef and kraut and lots of delicious melty oozing Swiss and 1000. Hit the spot. Potato salad is good as your side choice. (They also offer fries, pretzels, and a couple other sides) 

the ladies who work here are always friendly, chatting it up with regulars and strangers alike.  I'll be back again, and again, and again...."}
{"text":"I wanted to check the place out because of all the great reviews... But I was not impressed. I called in for a pick up order and they told me 15 to 20 minutes. I waited 15 minutes then left. When I got there I waited another 15 minutes! The reviews said it was fast service but it wasn't for me...I ordered a pita and when I took a bite into it it fell apart in my hands! It was very dry with no mayo or sauce in it. I was disappointed with this place..."}
{"text":"Voted #1 Lunch in Charlotte (and yes it is true!). I am always looking for affordable good food for lunch. They offer free soup with your entree, so yes based on the other yelp reviews, you should come hungry. I was searching on my phone for a good place to take some of my local clients, and they enjoyed it just as much as I did. Definitely recommend this place! Since I am in sales, they also offer great catering services, so the next time I have to bring some lunch I will be calling Bedder Bedder & Moore!"}

{"text":"I've only had this catered and have never been to the actual restaurant. 

The menu is fairly standard for a deli but they like to put tomatoes on  EVERYTHING. Even an egg salad sandwiches. 

I have a peculiar food allergy that confuses them every time the office orders from here. No matter what I order I have to carefully inspect my food to make sure the cook isn't out to get me. Again. 

High points are the turkey club and the egg salad. The Asian chicken salad is okay but the chicken has a Greek flavor that conflicts with the sesame dressing. Fries are on the greasy side. They may be better on site when fresh. The sweet tea is good."}
{"text":"Visiting from Florida. Service was great from beautiful and friendly waitress who had been there for 17 years. Food was delicious. We cleared our plates!"}
{"text":"WOW! I love it! Everything was so good! I can't think of the words to say because that Montford Special was amazing! The homemade soup was delicious as well. Im new to the area and heard about this place and how the new owners have really turned this small, secret place around in a good way. I'll have to say, it was a good experience and I'll be back with others! I'm in love!"}
{"text":"BB&M is named like a law firm.  I think they did it on purpose - kind of funny.  I've driven by it numerous times and always thought it looked interesting, so when I had the opportunity to grab some lunch in the area I headed over.

The place is only open during lunch hours and they seem to do a lot of catering business (for offices).  They do have a pretty large in-restaurant dining area with table service.  Their menu is pretty extensive and includes a lot of delicious looking items.  I ended up getting a Turkey Rueben and it was delicious!  The also give a cup of their soup-of-the day to all dining in customers.  It's a nice little perk before your sandwich comes out!

Besides the food, another standout was the service.  First, I did not expect and sandwich place to have tableside service.  Second, the waiter helping us out was really polite and energetic.  It was really impressive to see such amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing ! We were on the fence wether to go to Flying Biscuit which is just across the street . To our surprise Bedder Bedder & More has exceeded our expectation. We had the breakfast bowl which comes with a sausage gravy and a biscuit . I asked for a few modifications to accommodate my gluten free needs and there was no problemo . We will definitely be returning for breakfast/ brunch ."}
{"text":"This was a hidden gem for me for quite some time. I've passed it on Tryon a bunch of times without thinking much more than \"Hey, a sandwich place that sounds like a law firm\". Finally stopped in to fuel up after a long day of moving furniture and I'm glad I did. Let's just say that any place that offers me complimentary homemade soup is going to rate highly in my book. The soup was awesome too and since that first visit I've been back with the soups always consistently as or more delicious than the last.

As for the sandwiches, also great. Not the absolute best but certainly worth it and sufficient enough for my taste. I can't help but always feel that on my next visit I'm going to feel like the menu is a bit limited but after three visits, I was still able to find something new that appealed to me. Price point is pretty good as well (especially when factoring in the complimentary soup)!

Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a traditional deli/diner-type sandwich experience."}
{"text":"Ordered the NY Reuben with fries and soup of the day (potato).  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"I've been back since my initial review, and I have had better service since the first couple of times I went.  The food is excellent.  It is consistently delicious.  The complimentary soup is delicious as well (and I am not a soup fan)."}
{"text":"I will always remember the first time i came here. I was still new to Charlotte and my boss and sister brought me here.When we pulled up i was taken back a little its just in a small strip mall with nothing around it( I trusted they're judgment). As soon as we were greeted by Mrs.Jenkins I knew I was going to like it. Then we ordered our food and all of a sudden our server puts down a free bowl of soup in front of me!!! I LOVE soup!!! Well it was just delicious (Broccoli Cheese) and since then we go in all the time they always start you off with a soup i have come to love they're egg salad and chicken salad on a pita!! Everyday the soup is different!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Saturday lunch spot! The friendly staff at Bedder Bedder & Moore welcome you as you walk into the dining area and are seated. Arrive early before the lunch crowd, and as you browse the menu of many hot and cold sandwiches and wraps, be sure to note the item number of your selection because that is what you'll tell your server when your order is taken. Don't overlook the salads, quesadillas, and hamburgers either. My favorite items are the # 656 Firecracker Chicken wrap (on the spicy side, so beware) and the very filling # 619 BBQ Chicken Salad (which comes in a large taco shell bowl). I rarely drink sweet tea, but when I do, I only drink BB&M's sweet tea. We go back week after week and are never disappointed. Make Bedder Bedder & Moore YOUR Saturday (or any day) lunch spot!"}
{"text":"The best soup variety that I have ever had. They offer a different soup each day and they are freshly made not container and are served hot like a soup should be served. The sandwiches are great and the Marble Rye Ruben is a great find for Charlotte, you cant eat it all so take half with you or fill up."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! 

New owners came in in March. 

Sandwiches were excellent! portions were huge! menu was expansive. service and ambiance were really nice. 

can't say id change anything. def a regular customer here now."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really lost its appeal and has gone downhill due to new ownership. It use to be the hottest lunch spot in Myers Park/Montfort Park for great food, homemade soup and excellent service and staff.  Now it's lost all consistency. They never have a consistent hostess, the soup, which was the biggest draw has gone downhill. They don't even serve the soups that made them a hit. They've driven off their great employees who were there for many many years and who made the place great. It's just plain mediocre now at best. Sad for the customers who use to stand in line outside waiting for a table. Now it's hardly ever busy. They've lost their regular customers who had been coming for years. Tip: If it ain't broken don't fix it."}
{"text":"I have dined in once and our office has ordered delivery a couple of times (suprisingly, they deliver to the Ballantyne Corporate Park!).  The food is always really good quality and is served in generous portions.  I like the salads as well as the chicken melt."}
{"text":"Lunch is bangin. Breakfast is bangin. They serve breakfast all day on Saturday, which is bangin. Chicken and waffles, bangin.  Breakfast bowl, bangin.  Pimento cheese breakfast burger, haven't had it, probably bangin."}
{"text":"I like Bedder Bedder & Moore, but today I decided to try something new and it wasn't my favorite. 

I had the Black & Blue Grilled Chicken Sandwich which is served on grilled oat nut bread. The chicken was blackened and topped with tomato and melted bleu cheese crumbles. It also comes with blue cheese dressing, but I left that off.  

Unfortunately, the spices that they used on the blackened chicken along with the blue cheese resulted in the whole thing tasting way too salty for my liking. :-(  

Next time I'll stick with one of my stand-bys from here, such as the grilled chicken patti melt (sans dressing of course) or a salad."}
{"text":"I pass by this place every day and finally went out for lunch to try it today.  It's odd to me why they chose a name that sounds more like a law firm than a deli.  Did they also think to maybe more cleverly name their place Moore Bedder?  But names aside, went there to take some food to go and got the half sandwich and half soup deal.  I got the turkey and swiss and the reuben soup,  Both were just kind of OK and it seemed a bit weird to have a sandwich on regular wheat slices that weren't toasted.  Made it seem a lot less fancy than something I could make at home myself.  What was amazing though was their sweet potato bars for dessert.  I saw them on the counter and had to try one and they were even more delicious than I expected.  I ended up eating the whole bar in one sitting.  If you ever go here, that is definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I called in an order here for lunch. I had the Reuben, with a slight change, I had them replace the 1,000 dressing with spicy mustard. My husband had the Rosemary Roast Beef Sandwich along with a side of onion rings. Our food was wonderful. The serving size was more than enough for us both and we even had some onion rings left that we couldn't finish.  

The staff was friendly and on top of their service. The restaurant was very busy and I was very pleased with our choice......we will be returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!! I loved their soup of the day even though I'm not sure what it was. I got the grilled chicken Cobb and the soup and my husband got the NY style Reuben and onion rings. Fast delivery as well."}
{"text":"Standard deli. Nothing super special. Good soups and sandwiches.

Recommend the Reuben or the Veggie sandwich.

It is a small location and hidden, so you have to look for it. I was in the mood for Jason's Deli and stopped in here since it was close by. Not bad. I might try it again.

Service was so/so"}
{"text":"Soup was excellent. It was the Italian chicken soup, more like minestrone with penne and chicken, almost had a smoke flavor but that umami could have come from the largely cut mushrooms. Their famous salad, the grilled chicken Caesar, was tasty however it had way too much bread for it to be a salad, it was served in a taco shell and piled with croutons, the chicken was seasoned well as the bacon was an unnecessary but delightful touch(I mean it's bacon right?!) if I didn't have a bread salad this would easily be a 4 star in my opinion. Flavors were a B however delivery was a C-, C at most."}
{"text":"I dropped in here for a quick lunch since I was in the area. The people were nice which always make waiting for your food and easier process, even though it wasn't long. I ordered the chicken tender lunch special. 
The pricing here isn't too bad. I got my food to go, but when I got to my destination, the food was still at a good temperature. That's a win. The chicken tenders were not breaded (like I was expecting) but they were still good. Not great, but good. The chicken was moist, but I thought it lacked good seasoning. I got fries with my meal, and those were pretty good. Also, so far, they have my favorite sweet tea in this area. 
So, bottom like, so far, I think they are good. I will try them again and be sure I get the sweet tea."}
{"text":"Ummmm ok.. 

Foods 5/5 stars. The bacon burgers was yummy.. nicely cooked and comes out very very hot. And each and every customers get soup regardless of what you order. 

Customer services: 2/5 stars. We have a gentleman that was serving us. Occasionally he would forget about us. Then there's a lady that came back to ask whose is assisting us. My bestie pointed out. That lady quietly told him, this is my table. Then he turn to us and said how she treating you.. I'm thinking she haven't service us. You forgot us for a min. But wait whose servicing us now because I need water. 

Overall 3/5 star. Food come fast, good and piping hot. Too hot.. I would come back.. I hope they would improve on their communication on whose servicing which table because I just want to NOT be forgotten and my water fill!"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit to this little sandwich shop (it's not a deli, but serves \"deli-style\" sandwiches).  We were warmly greeted, seated quickly, and received a tasty cup of chicken soup.  It's their way of saying welcome and it worked!  Our waitress was great, too.  We ordered a chicken salad on wheat and a Dagwood with a side of potato salad.  The Dagwood would be a better sandwich IMO without the coleslaw which completed with the flavors of the meats and cheese, and it was too messy for my likes.  The hoagie roll was OK but lacked flavor--an unfortunate casualty of most Southern baking.  My wife thought her chicken salad sandwich lacked flavor, too, but was saved by the toasted wheat bread.  Two sandwiches, water only, tax and tip:  $22.50.  Not bad, but lotsa room to improve."}
{"text":"What happened to the chicken salad? I finally drove across town to visit my \"go to\" place for delicious chicken salad. Since I don't work close to the restaurant anymore, I haven't been there in quite some time. To my dismay I found out after returning home with our order that they have changed their recipe for their chicken salad. \"BLAND\" is the best way to describe it. I can make a tastier chicken salad in my kitchen and just to give the owners a heads up, using way too much celery does not add flavor. Why would you ruin a perfectly wonderful chicken salad recipe by changing it to be so bland it was tasteless? So a heads up to all the chicken salad lovers out there, do yourself a favor & don't order it at BBM, instead, head over to Chicken Salad Chick for delicious chicken salad!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the corner, Bedder Bedder and Moore serves soups, salads, and sandwiches. It's a small deli-type eatery.

The staff are very friendly! You are offered a cup of free soup to start. What a nice way to appease my stomach!

I ordered a Reuben sandwich. It came out hot, buttery, and gooey with cheese. The corned beef was good and not fatty. The veggie sandwich was good too. 

It's a place that I think I would go again if I was in the area; however, it isn't a place that I would make a special trip to. Go eat and enjoy."}
{"text":"WORSE customer service I have EVER received! I ordered 2 salads, and a pita one of the salads..the bbq chicken was incorrect, there was no corn or black beans in the salad. When I called 5 min after the salad was delivered I was told by Stephanie (the manager on duty, or  she said) she said that she could send me another salad or credit me a salad for a later date. Since I have a one hour lunch and only had 20min left I chose the credit. I called today 8/2 to redeem my credit and I was told that there was a $15 minimum.. I decided to ask the girls In the office if anyone wanted to order and they did so I called back and spoke to Stephanie to place the order...she NOW stated that I had a .50 cent CREDIT YESSSS A .50 CENT credit towards my order! HOW DOES THAT make up for the WRONG salad they sent me yesterday? It does not make up for it. she continued to argue with me back and forth and said I did not tell you that, bad attitude the whole way through. I said I wanted to speak with her boss and she said she was the manager on duty. If THIS is the way the MANAGER treats her employees I wonder how everyone else is allowed to treat customers? I am so upset that THIS is the way you guys do business, this is ridiculous . Stephanie obviously needs training in customer service. Yesterday 8/1 was my first time eating there, and I WILL NOT BE BACK! And I will also make sure people in the office here know the terrible service or lack of service is provided there! SHAME ON YOU

****update: minutes after the review was posted, Lisa (The new owner) called me back and let me know she was never made aware of this situation. she made sure to apologize many times and let me know this is NOT how they intend to do business. I appreciate the call and I appreciate the apology...I understand employees do things sometimes that the owners are not aware of, I hope employees get better training and the business grows. Thank you Lisa!"}
{"text":"Lentil soup of the day... Sooooo good! I ate the whole cup :) got the firecracker wrap with potato salad as my side. Yum! I will definitely be back! Glad someone told.me about this place."}
{"text":"Best food on the strip hands down. Best restaurant owners on the strip! Come hungry and leave happy."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is ok.  They are still trying to claim the \"Best Lunch\" the Charlotte Observer awarded them almost a decade ago.  It's your typical deli style menu with , sandwiches, wraps, etc but the prices have shot up due to rising food costs.  It's not horrible, and you get a complimentary small bowl of soup if you dine in.  It's just a place I wouldn't necessarily go to for a quick, cheap lunch."}
{"text":"The breakfast bowl is ahhhhhmazinggg. Their grits are so creamy and their gravy is on point! Their chicken and waffles is pretty darn delicious as well. And their customer service is spectacular. I'm looking forward to them being open for new late night hours!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast. The food is amazing. The service is impeccable and it's very quant. This really is a must try if you're in the area!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, a true sit down deli. I've eaten here three times now and the last time I went back to the reuben. They pile the meat up like a stack of hotcakes! Very impressed on the quality and flavor. A reuben should have hearty toasted bread with the dressing coating the whole sandwhich to keep the kraut from making it soggy. I was pleased to get it made right, with some crisp Utz chips on the side!

When you sit down they start you with a warm broth soup while you look over the menu. Very inviting and looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the 610 salad from here! The food has always been awesome but the service tends to be sub par. It always feels like I am inconveniencing them. We always get it to go because every time we have actually eaten in the restaurant we have been disappointed, EXCEPT you do get free soup of the day if you dine in"}
{"text":"The only reason it's not a 5 star is it's a bit cramped and the parking is tight. Portions are big and fresh. Soups are great. If you're in a hurry for lunch, they will get you in and out quickly."}
{"text":"This is one of Charlotte's best lunch destinations. The menu is varied, fresh and delicious. When I'm dieting their low-carb offerings help me stay on the wagon."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. I usually only order the Char-grill salad with blue cheese or the Reuben. I've had other things and it's always been tasty. They have free homemade soup with an entry order when you dine in and mostly the soup tastes great. Today it was beef and barley and I didn't really like it. I didn't rate a 5 because the one thing is that the severs tend not to check back as often even when it's not busy."}
{"text":"We having been ordering from here for years and the food is always awesome. My usual is a 824 which is a turkey and Munster Panini with avocado. It is so tasty I could literally eat Thai everyday."}
{"text":"First time at Bedder, Bedder, and Moore today and we weren't disappointed. The burgers were extraordinary, both in size and in preparation, and in flavor. No doubt that it was hand pattied, fresh beef. Not to be outdone, the pimento cheese +chicken held its own. Service was welcoming and without fault. Shonda went out of her way (or maybe it's normal there) to take care of us. Only negative? Too stuffed afterward, and in dire need of a nap."}
{"text":"The food and the service was great!  It's very low key though...it kinda feels like an office break room.  The utensils are plastic.  The food tho...awesome!!  As long as you know what you're getting:  good food with good people."}
{"text":"My office at SouthPark has been ordering delivery from BBM for years.  Every time I get something I am just amazed at the quality and deliciousness offered by this restaurant.  Now the prices are a little high, so by the time tax/tip/delivery is added on the price is steep, so we don't eat here as often as we used to.  They have great homemade salad dressings and bread.  Chicken Salad is about the best I have ever had from a deli.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I find their food to be unique.   Today I had the Firecracker Chicken Wrap - tender chicken, onion, jalapenos, and quac in a nicely toasted tortilla.  Fantastic.  I've had great luck with their salads as well.  Love what they do here!"}
{"text":"Well we were in our way thru Charlotte to Atlanta and decided to give it a try for breakfast as the reviews were fantastic. Not so much.  Prices very inflated for an egg combo (plastic) plate which included 3 teeny slices of avocado, two small pieces of sausage (one piece the 'butt end'...really??) and a margarine/grease soaked biscuit that seemed like it came from a pop can.  My husbands breakfast club was ok but not great.  Also know the grits come orangey due to cheddar added so if you don't want that give a shout out when ordering.  As an aside, 80s transistor quality music.  Come on. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I order lunch from here at least once a week. I love their turkey pita with a side of potato salad! I have never ordered anything I don't like."}
{"text":"This little inconspicuous place has such good food it makes me wonder why I hadn't heard much about it.  My boyfriend and I went for breakfast and it was delicious!  I had the breakfast wrap with grilled veggies and potatoes.  I got it on the wheat wrap and the potatoes came with sweet potatoes which was a nice surprise.  My boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich and that was amazing as well.  The cheesy grits is one of the best we've had in Charlotte.  We will be going back more often!"}
{"text":"The deli is located in a plaza that is like a small strip mall.  Parking is ok but I could see if it were really busy, parking would be a problem.  Food is outstanding, hands down.  From the complimentary cup of homemade soup, sandwiches, quesadillas, etc. it's all delicious.  

Some issues:  TOO much food.  After the cup of hearty soup, I am not at all starved anymore.  Out comes the biggest wrap I have ever had.  I barely ate half.  I had my three kids with me and there was no kids menu.  EVERYTHING on the menu (whether it's a burger, sandwich, wrap or salad) is all the same price ($8.49) and I think it was $2.49 for drinks.  So basically $10 pp so our bill (1 adult/3 kids) was almost $50 with tip.  Quite pricey for an informal lunch out.  Plus, none of them came close to finishing their meals either.

The orange bread up by the counter is SUPER.  But that is pricey too.  A small (tiny) piece is $3 a piece.  Each one my my kids wanted one....so that's another $10.  

Anyway, I would say it's GREAT if your starving and maybe not the best place for kids unless they eat adult sized portions.  

Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  It's small on the inside, so try to avoid the lunchtime rush if possible.  Service was fast, and there are many choices on the menu for all tastes.  They also give everyone a cup of soup for free while your waiting for your food, which is a nice touch.  And it's great soup! Overall, I enjoyed every bite and would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Uptown delivery! Great Reuben on Rye with pasta salad side. Only complaint I have was for the driver ( I had  to meet him a couple blocks down) but the food is just awesome. Give it a try for lunch!"}
{"text":"They recently catered our staff Christmas party. Without a doubt their catering has been one of the best I've ever had (and I've been to a lot of weddings.) We were served \"family style\" so large plates filled with food set in front of us. I could have just kept the entire dish of greens in front of me, but of course it was a staff party so I had to act accordingly. I did splurge on the pork chops flavored to perfection with apples (don't ask me how). While everyone around me had maybe 1 pork chop, I was able to devour 2 and a half because in all honesty it was impossible to stop eating them. 
Their servers were fast and friendly. If you want catering, and you want it done right this is the place to go. I've never been to the restaurant, but from their excellent catering I will of course make a trip to the restaurant in the near future."}
{"text":"Had heard so many good things about Bedder Bedder and was excited to try it.  My wife and I headed south one day and made it point to stop in and experience.  What an experience it was.   

We were seated immediately and the service throughout the meal was top notch.  They were attentive but no over bearing.   Happy to help with suggestions on what to have.  At one point our waitress looked at me and said, \"Everything is good, I recommend one of each.\"   Such a great time.  

The atmosphere was great.  It was a nice local place that served great food.  Very personable, like hanging out at a friends house.   

So onto the food.  Man do they have a great selection.  So much to choose from.  They start off by giving you free soup.  SO GOOD!!!!  My wife had the Itallian panini and I had the Chicken Salad sandwich.  Both had really good flavor.  My wife is picky about Itallian sandwiches and her eyes lit up at first bite.   The chicken salad was pretty tremendous.  Not too much mayonnaise and had a lot of chicken.  

Please support this business.  Will repeat"}
{"text":"I just love this place. If you like diner food you will love this place. The food is very good and always tasty and consistent. Everyone is always sooooooo nice and considerate.  Also, with every order they give you a free cup of the soup of the day.  Its all locals and their lunch crowd is always busy. Give this place a try if your looking for no frills local joint."}
{"text":"I called in to place an order and while everyone I spoke with was nice there was a $2.00 delivery charge when their website said \"free delivery\" in bold letters on every page.
 I was told this was a \"temporary fuel charge\" 
The food sounds delicious, but the prices are high, even for uptown 
(a $7.50 chicken sandwich?) 

To top it off the gentleman I spoke with hung up on me after telling me about the temporary charge for fuel. 

I definitely won't try this place, even if it did win \"Best Lunch\""}
{"text":"Food was amazing and fresh. Complimentary lasagna soup when we sat down was a nice treat. Staff were super friendly and attentive. Breakfast all day Saturday. We will certainly return!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and all, but nothing really stood out the few times I have gone and there is nothing too exciting or unique on the menu. Today I had an interesting experience while trying to use Groupon type voucher and it is was a difficult process. The first cashier tried to just take 50% off my meal and tried explaining to her that I already paid for $5 so I could have $10, hence the 50% off. She knew she had never seen this before but still insisted she was right initially but then went to get someone else for help. The second person came up to me and said, \"do we have a problem here sir?\" I could tell when she was serving me earlier that it must have been a bad day and when she asked me that question, it came off in a very un-affable mood. Finally they got the third guy who knew how to take my coupon, but tried telling me I had to buy more food at first. 

As I said, I have eaten there before and the previous experience was much better than the latter. But today was an off day, I did not enjoy my time spent."}
{"text":"Just a really shitty deli. Old cold cuts, bread that's not fresh & slapped together. I'm no Jimmy Johns fan but when you see this places quality, you understand why they're doing so well in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Good deli/diner food. The complimentary beef and veggie soup was fantastic. There's a huge menu with great variety. Just about everything is one price. I've been a few times so far. The salads come in a huge bowl with plenty of protein. The chicken pita is currently my favorite menu item."}
{"text":"Good deli food. Has the turkey sandwich with bacon and melted cheese. With onion rings. Great for a good breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  And the staff was great!  Only negatives be is I wish I had a real fork and knife.  But that's just a preference will definitely go again."}
{"text":"My family and I continued our sampling of Charlotte's breakfast offerings by going to Bedder Bedder & Moore this morning. We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and quickly seated. Drink orders were taken and delivered promptly. Our orders were taken and served in a very timely manner. I had the chicken and waffles served with both warm syrup and a cup of sausage gravy. The 4 chicken strips were crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffle was warm with just a bit of crust. My daughter had the biscuits and gravy served in a large bowl. She said it was really good. (I used one of my chicken strips to dip in my gravy and it was hands down the best gravy I've ever had in a restaurant). My fiancé went with the eggs and cheese grits. She couldn't rave enough about how delicious they were. We all agreed that this was one of the better places we have tried and that it would not be our last visit. Next time maybe for lunch, as their menu had some interesting things we want to try!!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here atleast 6 times in the past year. The first order I got was the chicken cesar salad in the tortilla shell. To say my lettuce was DROWNING in dressing would be an understatement. I dipped my fork into the salad and it just disappeared! I figured I'd give this place a few more tries since it's suppose to be good but today ruined it for me forever! I spent 23.26 on a club sandwich (which wasn't that good) and a side of potato salad. The potato salad was AWFUL! Maybe its supposed to be mashed potatoes covered in mayo but it was horrendous! I have no problem paying the above amount (includes addl charges for delivery and such) if the food was GOOD! STAY AWAY!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating breakfast and lunch here for years.  The staff has changed some but it's always friendly here and the food is fresh and delicious. Little place but the wait is not long. Highly recommend you try this secret garden."}
{"text":"I usually frequent the location near Woodlawn Rd and it was my first time visiting this location.  Since I'm familiar with their cuisine, I ordered lunch online from this location and it was quite convenient as you can pay online and just walk in to pick up your order. I ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad pita with chips and a side of pasta salad and my husband had the All American Bacon Cheeseburger.  The food was definitely delicious and since it was my husband's first time eating from here, he was won over as well.  The staff and service were pleasant and I will definitely come back to this location to order again.  The food portions are always consistent and are of nice size as well as taste, so you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Alright Yelpers, who's been keeping this little sandwich gem a secret??! 

I had heard a few people on Twitter mention this out-of-the-way place, so I was in the area, wrapping up my lunch hour and decided to grab a sandwich to go. (Thanks to my Yelp mobile app, I had no trouble finding it off Montford.) Within just a few quick minutes my toasted sandwich & drink were ready and I was on my way.

Oh.My.Goodness. The turkey sandwich was the messiest, yummiest sandwich I've had in recent memory! I don't even know what I got, since I asked the hostess for a recommendation and that's what I went with. But it had turkey, cheese, coleslaw, and 1000 Island Dressing. I subbed rye bread for whole wheat. I was practically drooling all the way home in the car, as I could smell what promised to be a tasty lunch. It did not disappoint.

The menu looked large, so I will definitely be back to spend a little more time exploring their other options and perhaps trying something new next time."}
{"text":"Get here early for lunch...they get filled up. Sandwiches are great as is the soup.  I have moved from Charlotte, but I have never found an egg salad that competes."}
{"text":"At first I loved this place. A little strip mall sandwich shop with a country cooking feel. I read on Yelp that all meals come with a free soup when you dine in. Score! Y'all know I love some free food. The soup of the day on this particular day was beef and lentil and it was absolutely delicious. 

Unfortunately that soup was the best part of the meal. I ordered the weekly special which was a buffalo chicken salad and the sauce had a good spice level and the blue cheese bits complimented it well but the chicken was strange. It was cold and had the texture of rubber like it was a piece of meat so processed it was almost not recognizable as chicken. I didn't eat much of it, but ate around it to try to fill up on lettuce. The server was very friendly and I liked that they had placed out samples of their sweets (I took one on the way out and it was yummy).

A couple weeks later I had a stressful morning at work and went home for lunch and knowing this my working from home man ordered sandwiches from Bed, Bedder & Moore scheduled to arrive when I got home. I would review the sandwich if I could but they had not arrived an hour and a half later and I had to get back to work. This was almost 45 minutes after the estimated delivery time and the order was placed well before the lunch rush. 

Sadly when I think of this place I think of hunger - both from a salad with the chicken I ate around and a sandwich I never received. It is a shame since the soup was good and it is close to home and work but I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"Maybe it's \"bedder\" for meat eaters, but I was not impressed. It's nice that you can order online, but my veggie wrap just wasn't very good. Who puts uncooked squash and zuchinni in a wrap with iceberg lettuce and some onion and calls it a veggie wrap? The description states it's a grilled wrap- why aren't the veggies cooked?? So odd."}
{"text":"After seeing a picture somewhere of the reuben from Bedder, Bedder, & Moore (Charlotte Agenda maybe?), a discussion began between a friend and me about our love for reubens. Further questions led to discussion about what the best reuben in Charlotte was, and thus A Reuben Adventure was born (both our names start with A).

I was excited to try the reuben that sparked the adventure and has led me to try about 30 reubens around the city. I wouldn't say the reuben is the best in the city, but it is in the upper third of the many I've tried. 

The reuben is fairly classic - decent corned beef, covered in swiss, proper amount of kraut and russian to top it off, and of course surrounded by rye. The corned beef had good flavor, and the heaping of swiss added plenty of flavor. Although the bread was advertised, it was just standard marbled rye. My biggest qualm was with the kraut - it was a bit stringy in texture, something I have since realized is likely because it was tossed on the griddle and dried out (this has happened at numerous other places I've tried). The stringy texture clashes with the rest of the sandwich and takes it down a notch. Overall I was still happy with my selection and would recommend anyone stopping in to give the reuben a try."}
{"text":"I love this place, you receive the same wait staff most of the time, which is great that lets me know they treat their staff great if they dont have a high turnover.  Maybe Corporate America should ask them their secret lol 
Anyway , I never get the same thing, I always get different items off the menu, but any of the patty melts are my favorite, tuna, chicken, turkey.  The salads are very large and generous with meat and cheese. Their soups are different every day and homemade, things you might not put together at home, but when you try it there its wonderful.  Like the sweet potatoe pie soup strange but it was smooth and creamy with some pie crust.  The deserts are very sweet, too sweet for me so I stick to just their soup which comes with your meal everyday and a sandwich who needs desert you wont have room :)"}
{"text":"Um, yum. Fast, friendly service? Check. An array of tasty sandwiches? Check. Super affordable? Check! I have been made a fun out of Bedder Bedder & Moore! 

This location is a bit hidden off of Montford - it's below Luisa's. And when you walk in, don't expect anything fancy - paper menus, plastic dinner wear, styrofoam plates and to-go boxes. You're there for a great 'wich and a free cup of soup. Yes. Free. As soon as you sit down, your server will bring it over with your beverage. 

As for lunch, I chose the Chicken Philly Wrap - a giant grilled wrap stuffed with hearty chunks of grilled chicken breast, grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms and wrapped with a big slice o' cheese. It was fresh. It was delicious. I would happily get it again sans mushrooms as those canned shrooms give me the willies.

Will I be back? Mmmhmmm."}
{"text":"Bedder Bedder & Moore: the lunch spot that sounds more like a law firm.

The anchor of a strip mall at Tryon and Clanton... you have probably passed by this place without even giving it a second thought. Word to the wise: never doubt a place that's always packed during the lunchtime rush.

Sandwiches, wraps, homemade soups, salads, quesadillas. If you eat in, don't order soup with your meal. Why? Because you get a complimentary one! They also offer free delivery.

Basically everything on the menu is $8.49. So go ahead and figure you will spend at least 10 bucks here. In terms of the amount of food you get... it's definitely worth it. 

Some of my favs here: the Charbroiled Chicken Caesar and Charbroiled Chicken Cobb salads (holy-giant-chicken-breast batman), California Style Turkey Reuben (usually can save half for later) and dubbed BBM's best seller: the Turkey Provolone Pita. Sandwiches come with pretzels or chips depending on what you order. Salads have a fresh baked knot.

My office has used BBM several times to cater work lunches and events. It's a fan favorite here.

Friendly staff. I typically call in orders for pick up. Always a happy person on the other end of the line. Food is always ready in a reasonable amount of time. I'm usually in and out in under 5 minutes. 

BBM has been cranking out good food in the Charlotte area for more than 20 years. Here's to the next 20!"}
{"text":"No, this is not where you go to find a lawyer if you get in a fender bender. It's where you venture to for a delicious lunch.

I've been a BBM fan since I moved to Charlotte ten years ago. I usually visit the other location, but this one is right around the corner from me. Well, for another day at least. Moving day tomorrow!

Anyways, the only problem I have with this place is I can never decide what I want. I pretty much like it all. Turkey Reuben, Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad, Firecracker Wrap. If you dine in, you get free soup with your meal. Heads up: if Minestrone is one of the options... get it. Delicious.

BBM is great for catering office lunches, meetings and what not. Need a quick lunch option? Call you order in for pick. You can be in and out quickly."}
{"text":"Nice diner style food near my work place , chicken sandwiches on steroids . Very good free soup appetizers, only could eat half the sandwich since it was so thick ."}
{"text":"Bring your appetite if you plan to eat here.  It all starts with the cup of soup they bring out and then goes from there.  For the most part, they have sandwiches here although there are other things on the menu if you don't want a sandwich.  But getting back to the sandwiches, they have most anything you could want served on fresh bread.

This place does get very busy during lunch so you may want to get there before the lunch rush starts or you will be waiting a long time.  Also, there is parking in the back if the front lot is full when you get there.  I wish someone had told me about the parking the first time I went there."}
{"text":"Can I say GREAT PLACE! Delivery was on time. Orders were EXACTLY as described and placed. Fresh flavorful food! I'm usually the runner and last to eat when ordering for my company soooo I didn't get to take a picture. But good bank for your buck forsure! This might just be my new go to"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of the typical delis I would find back in the Philadelphia area. It's a quick spot to grab lunch and the portions are a good size. This isn't the place to come if you want to be served and dined, but if you want a good deli sandwich, then yes. 

I tend to judge places based on staple foods (sushi- spicy tuna, Greek- gyro meat, etc) so when I came here I went right for their \"New York style Ruben\". It is served with a complimentary bowl of whatever soup they have that day and chips. There was a good amount of corned beef and the ratio of kraut/thousand island was spot on too. Now there aren't mounds of corned beef like you might get in PA/NJ/NY but they certainly didn't skimp! All in all, I was pleased in what I was served for lunch and will certainly be back to check out this deli again!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough great things - they knew us by name by our second visit and their service is as great as their food! We love stopping in on our lunch break a couple times a month. They make you feel like family! Debbie is an amazing waitress! Everything I've eaten has been great."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service and super prices! Our first choice for lunch in Charlotte! We have ordered cookies numerous times to help host our Estate Sales for we own a liquidation company, Timeless Collage & Estate Services, LLC, the treats are wonderful and enjoyed by our customers and staff! This is an awesome restaurant and we appreciate your consistency!"}
{"text":"Decent deli spot for a casual lunch. Had the chicken gyro and it was pretty tasty. The waitresses are cool and down to earth (our waitress told us she spaced out and came back and asked for our order again). A lady walked by and asked if we were done eating our crackers with our soup....which I thought was weird....I said \"no\" and she still took them! Lol! I guess there was a cracker shortage...."}
{"text":"It's ridiculous when you say on your website you can deliver and then when you place an order or try to it pops up saying you can't deliver so you should make sure that you have the zip codes correct"}
{"text":"Eh, my experience was a 3, my lunch partner's was a 2.  Let me start by saying, if you're eating in - don't order anything with a soup as a side... everyone gets a complimentary cup of soup, and you end up with a bag of chips/pretzels with your half sandwich/etc. 

I ordered one of the club sandwiches, no mayo. I received the club with mayo, without tomato. Actually a ridiculous amount of mayo. My lunch partner ordered a half sandwich with soup. Not only was that pointless (for a moment we were expecting a possible double soup - especially since it was super tasty that day - um, stuffing croutons??) But then the sandwich was served cut all sorts of wrong. There were actually crust pieces on both sides of the sandwich (frankly I'm not even sure how this happened, but imagine a standard half of a sandwich and your top piece of bread has the standard two-sided crust and then a cut edge side, but then underneath there was a two-sided crustless piece with a long crusted edge... yeah, so no soft crustless first bite). Both of our sandwiches had a large percentage of the sliced meat bundled in the middle, so the edge pieces were really just mayo and bread, but I could overlook that in the future.

I like that they give you a small jug to refill your own drink with, but at the same time I feel like it became an excuse to never check in besides bringing the food and the check. At one point I though about asking for a sliced tomato, since I would have really liked one on my sandwich, but our server couldn't be found. I could tell plenty of people had built great relationships with certain servers, but we (and a few other tables) seemed to be at a loss when it came to any help. 

My sandwich was not anything spectacular, and I know I can make the same at the closer to me Laurel Market (barely a price difference and I know it's going to come out exactly how I ordered it) but the idea of surprise daily soups are appealing and the monthly specials sounded good, so I might find myself in BB&M again."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of enjoying Bedder, Bedder & Moore catering, but finally made it to their restaurant today for lunch.
Upon arrival I realized it was a quaint diner like restaurant. Complimentary Soup was offered, dine in only. Today's soup was Chicken Noodle  ! It had good flavor but the noodles were a little hard.
For lunch I ordered the Turkey French Dip with Fries.
The sandwich was pretty big, but mainly bread. And the Au Jus was clear...good, but strange. I've never seen clear Au Jus. The fries were seasoned and cooked just right.
Definitely a nice spot for sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"For the life of me I don't understand why this place is so popular, or how could it be possibly anything \"best.\"
It's a block away from my work, and I came here once in 2 years because I lost my mind that one day (no, because my lunch mate wanted to eat there and I was being a nice friend armed with a coupon... paying full price for this place should be a crime).
It's so packed on any given day, thus it's not per se the best \"quick bite\" option. Because it is so packed, service isn't stellar either (granted the waitress I had was sweet and nice hence I gave 2 instead of 1 star). So in order for it to be \"best lunch\" you would think the food is out of this world?! NOPE. I had a French Dip, and the best part was the au jus. It's a sandwich shop and the sandwich wasn't good. Roast beef (on menu it said it was home roasted) was dry and plain. And for the crazy amount of money you're paying for the sandwich/wrap, you get a bag of chips and a cup of soup if you dine in. 
Maybe someone can explain to me the appeal of this place, but seriously, go to Harris Teeter and get a sub, it's better, cheaper, faster and more."}
{"text":"Where to start, plastic forks spoons and knives, styrofoam cups and bowls. I ordered coffee but they don't have milk here . And apparently if you order coffee you get it after all the food shows up.
If you like bad service, bad food and crappy atmosphere this is your place."}
{"text":"Bedder Bedder & Moore always sounded like it was law agency that I never really paid it n e attention until I was stopped at the light and really took a good look an was like \"oh...you can eat here!\" I've never actually been inside to eat but a work function used their services to cater the event. I was skeptical at first but one bite into my Chicken Salad Sandwich completely changed my mind. The chicken tasted as if it had been slow roasted in a rotisserie grill all day; it had that much flavor. It also included tomatoes and celery; the one thing that I thought it could have had was some onions. The plus side was that it had just enough mayo...not too dry and not too sloppy. I had a small side of potato salad and besides from mine (don't mean to toot my own horn but toot toot) it was really good. Along with a melt in your mouth macadamia cookie and some lemonade this was a really nice lunch."}
{"text":"If you plan on going to Bedder Bedder and More, come hungry!  Your meal starts with their complimentary soup of the day. I've been here twice and have had the stuffed bell pepper, and mushroom cheeseburger soup. They have sandwiches, burgers, and more delicious offerings.

A lunchtime favorite- this place gets a little busy around lunch hour. But it's always good food, and lots of it. I don't think I've ever finished a sandwich here!

The Rosemary Roast beef is a good choice, or the Reuben. Try the onion rings...if you have any room for more food. Overall good place for some grub!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered takeout lunch from here and was pleasantly surprised to find a substantial entree. I ordered the Firecracker wrap, this came with pickle, a side of Utz chips, and the best house made ranch you will ever try! Seriously.. the ranch is top notch. 

I loved the flavor the wrap had, had a kick with the pepper jack and jalapenos. It had a good amount of chicken, all good white pieces. I would have like to have more veggies like bell pepper and black beans. The tortilla had a great texture. Surprisingly, it is listed at 360 calories, I'm not sure if I believe that, but one can hope. 

I will definitely be back and ordering this again hopefully, I can add some more veggies to it."}
{"text":"I really love the price and the food. I so far have only ordered the cobb salad and wow! They give you a huge honking chicken breast. I eat half and save the other half for dinner. The salad dressing are all good and fattening I imagine. I always get it on the side with extra lemons - I use the lemons as dressing and will dip a couple of pieces here and there. 

But for $9.50 - you get a huge salad and FRESH chicken. Really glad a co-worker told me about this place. I always pick up my lunch. Will have to try other options one day, but for now, I love their salad."}
{"text":"You honestly cannot go wrong with any sandwich here. They are all delicious. I introduced my parents to this place and they are also addicted. A great spot to grab a lunch sandwich of any style. Definitely one of the better ( no pun) sandwich options in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My first time at this amazing place and most definitely won't be my last! I enjoyed the New Southwest quesadilla with steak. it was amazing! Like nothing I've had before. The portion was great and the taste was even better. The owner Lisa even stopped by my table to see if I enjoyed my meal. I really enjoyed from the time I walked in and smelled all of the deliousness in the air! Till my belly got full. I can't wait to tell people about this place! I know they will love it as much as I did! I will be back. I'm so glad I was in the area, this place is five star!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy local place that is pretty busy during the lunch rush. The place is small but surprisingly fits a good number of patrons for dine-in. My husband and I were there this past week with our daughter. They offer a cup of complimentary soup if you dine in, which they asked us if we wanted some, we said yes, and they forgot to give us soup. We asked for soup after a bit of a wait, which was no problem. They apologized for the wait. We got to try their shepherds pie soup, which was hot (temperature wise) and tasty. I had a burger and fries. The burger was fresh but bland, could've used a bit more salt but nonetheless was overall okay. They add fresh lettuce tomato slices and pickles to the burger, and it was on a brioche bun. Fries were hot, fresh, seasoned with celery salt. My husband had the Turkey Smasher with coleslaw--he said it reminded him of a typical \"melt\" sandwich. Coleslaw was crisp and fresh. As for my daughter, they didn't give us a kids menu so we had to ask for one, but they do serve the breakfast items all day and she got the chicken and waffles. The tenders on the plate were very hot and fresh and crispy but tiny for its size. If your child was bigger/hungrier than ours, it wouldn't be a decent portion size. The waffles, however, were big and very yummy. Homemade and fluffy. 
Overall, 4.5 stars docking for the above-mentioned items but will be back to try some other items on their menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly and ready to please. The breakfast club was excellent. The breakfast potatoes are regular and sweet potatoes mixed. Delicious!  The breakfast wrap and cheese grits were outstanding too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"have never been here for breakfast but I hear it's awesome. What I can vouch for is lunch, which has been incredible the ten or so times I've come here. Great service, great low-key atmosphere and even better (bedder and moore!) is the food, which is well made and plentiful! Any sandwich you get is going to be awesome as I've tried most of them. Will eat here yet again very soon!"}
