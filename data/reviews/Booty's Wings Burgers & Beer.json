{"text":"Food and drinks are great! However, the OWNER needs an attitude adjustment and to learn customer service. My group and I were absoutley stunned to find out she was an owner after the rude service she gave us. The bartender and waiters were good though"}
{"text":"How I rate Booty's.....  1 Service:   awesome waitress (Dion)                    Very attentive to our table, very knowledgeable about the menu, prompt response to our request, overall awesome...  2 Food: absolutely amazing.we ordered several flavors of boneless wings and they were amazing!!! Onion petals were to die for.awesome place. Bringing all our friends here!!!  3. Read the reviews before coming ,  I was skeptical,  but after this awesome experience I will be back with friends  and become a repeat customer..  4: staff: very polite, attentive, awesome...  5.kitchen staff:. Keep the awesome food coming out of your kitchen"}
{"text":"Loved it!  I had the wings because I Saw they have a deal where I got like 25 % off when I ordered my wings to go! I saw a previous post where it took them 45 min to get their wings.... EECK It only took about 20 min for mine ( should have called it in a head of time) Being not a huge BWW fan I found BOOTY's to be great! I loved the wings... not too scrawny and just enough sauce! kuddos to you guys!"}
{"text":"This was an OK place, nice enough people and atmosphere. I had the fish tacos and wings.......wings you cant go wrong with but, the fish tacos were a little disappointing, and they only have talapia which is my least favorite fish. I'll have to try more but after my first visit, im not too crazy on going back."}
{"text":"The food did not taste good.  I was very disppointed.  It was flavorless.  I went with MOS burger (recommendation from waitress) and it was greasy and not much taste.  My son went with crispy chicken and it said the sandwich  sauce was mayonnaise and it didn't have anything.  It was dry.  I informed the waitress i was disappointed with the meal and she didn't say anything but offer the check.   Not good customer service...  The bootylicious appertizer was good.  But that's it!!"}
{"text":"Great place, cold beer. Nice atmosphere. Can't wait until football season starts, think this is a go to place to have some wings/beers and watch my team. TV's on every wall. Burger was fantastic - wings and tacos a got a rave reviews from our group.  Waitstaff was great and friendly-"}
{"text":"First, the good... We love Booty's for wings. Coming from the East Coast, finding anything remotely close to food from home is tough and Booty's does the best job at delivering wings. Last night we had the Buffalo Gold and the Desert Sweet Heat. They did not disappoint. Not the best we've had, just the best we've had in AZ. We will definitely be back for the wings. Our server Jacob was pretty awesome especially considering he had tables all over the place and ran his butt off all night long. He was attentive, my glass was never empty, and overall he did a stellar job. Next the bad... We went to see the pay-per-view UFC fights which Booty's shows to its customers without charging a cover. You simply have to spend $12 per adult and $5 per child during the fights and ta-da you get to watch your faves beat the heck out of each other on multiple TVs and big screens. So why bad?? You cannot HEAR any of it. The volume of the sound system was \"all the way up\" and yet, it was inaudible over the din. Part of the fight night experience is being able to hear the broadcast. They need to improve their sound system and crank it up so those of us who actually wanted to watch the fights could hear them instead of the drunken shrieking and shouting conversations that were going on all around the joint. Speaking of this...  The Ugly... We called in advance because we wanted to know if we could reserve a spot for the fights. We were told that they do not reserve seats and it is a first come/ first serve system. Cool by us since we wanted to get there early enough for the prelims anyway. Once we arrived, we spotted the area we wanted and were told that that spot was reserved... hmmm? When we asked about what we had been told, the response was that \"The Owner\" reserved the spot. Understanding that ownership has its privileges, we select the table next to the owners and were told that that too was reserved by \"The Owner\". So we opted for a third spot and apparently the \"Buckeye Owner\" had reserved that area... Bad show to Andy and Peggy who according to the banner above the bar are the proprietors of Booty's on Bell. Oh... but wait, there's more!! Not only did they demonstrate poor form with their \"do as I say not as I do policy\"... The \"Buckeye Owner's\" table was absolutely disruptive to every party around them. They were so loud, I thought my ears were going to start bleeding. People all around them were constantly turning to see what the noise was all about. One of the females at the table was \"the shrieker\" of the bunch while her male counterpart on the loudness scale was more concerned with his \"cat like reflexes\" as he dodged a spilled drink. In fact he was so proud that I expected him to thump his chest as he shouted his athletic prowess at staying dry multiple times. We also observed their party bumping into other patrons as they went back and forth from the outside smoking area to their table without apology.  No owner I know would tolerate any patron behaving in way that disrupts the customers around them and yet there they were... totally oblivious to everyone and only concerned with doing shots. Maybe if they were in their bar rather than their partners' they would've behaved better but I digress.  The final analysis: Go to Booty's for wings. Go for lunch or happy hour, but DO NOT go for UFC fight night. They are clueless about what fight fans want. Next time, we will either stay home and give the $$ to the cable company or try Tailgaters right next to Booty's since it appeared that they too showed the fight."}
{"text":"Finally!  A fantastic bar and grill on the far west side!  Service is awesome and food is fantastic!  Fresh wings, not frozen and you can taste the difference!     Four Peaks Kiltlifter on draft is a home run, and they have a great IPA on tap too. Great Happy Hour menu.  Megan, our waitress was great!  Plenty of TVs so you will catch every game.  Only suggestion - get BuzzTime Trivia for some added entertainment.  Overall - great food, clean place, friendly staff.  We will be back - often!"}
{"text":"Service sucks!!! Bartender is lazy and the only way you get a drink is if you are begging!! Get your priorities straight...."}
{"text":"This is a GREAT place to gather with co-workers after work or take the entire family.  The owner is friendly and walks around and introduces himself and also ask how your service has been.  Drinks and prices are great.  Food is amazing and fresh every time. Did I mention FUN people come to this place to gather...."}
{"text":"Best wings around & great fresh food. Nothing's just frozen and deep fried. Always great service from Britney and Taylor. We come here weekly since moving here. Love it."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the best places! I just moved here from CO and this place has the best wings and service! Jake and Dion are my favs!!! Definitely feel at home."}
{"text":"Bootys atmosphere is fun and the wings are  to write home to mom about! The service has always been excellent. You can always find the game on one of there TVs."}
{"text":"Wednesday 60 cent delicious wings I work by this location and as often as I can go for 60 cent wings they prepare them as you request. The service here is top notch."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. Staff is friendly. Manage must hide in the back cause I've never seen them."}
{"text":"This place is smelly! And where are the sexy  waiters??!! But the smell is so...delightful....and the music...seriously, backstreet boys?!"}
{"text":"great wings, like the some of the best wings I've ever had, but the restaurant was visibly very dirty and my waitress was somewhat rude and unattentive."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Awesome service, great food, and always has the beer and tv's flowing! Thanks guys for being AWESOME! Buckeye location also rocks!!"}
{"text":"This isn't the best place. As I walked in there is an EXTREMELY loud band that was terrible! We ordered our drinks and I got water. The water tasted really really dirty. I was already  disappointed and was expecting the food to be better. After waiting over 30 minutes we got out food. Our wings were pretty good, but not worth the price. Our french fries came out cold. I won't be eating here again that's for sure !"}
{"text":"What a great place awesome friendly staff.  Live musicians on Fri and Sat cheapest drinks ive found 1.75 booty brew  ( tastes like coors)..  stick to the wings as they are very good buffalo chipotle garlic won first in national buffalo wing festival.   Also take a minute to talk to the staff very funny people (Also how i learned a out the first place medal).  Previous reviews where when bootys just started out.  Definetly evolved since then...  Why judge off of teething issues."}
{"text":"Great cheeseburger,perfect fries. Lots of TV's to watch the big games. Service was above average. Good place for all."}
{"text":"This place is empty on football sunday hope its just because its almost closing time and not because of bad reviews. 1st time in but we will be back. Lots of flavors & let you try as many as you want. The Hickory BBQ was the best so far. Got those ones sloppy & they came out w/ lots o sauce but not soggy still had crisp."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place with a friend while visiting the area.   51 different options for wings. Top 3 in National Championships for wings for last 3 years. Yes...they are that good. I loved the rubbed version we tried.   Then...I doubled down with the Friday all-you-can-eat Fish Fry. I order fish & chips every time I'm in London (maybe 20 times at this point) and I can safely say this was the best fried fish I've had. They use huge Talapia filets that are so moist and delicious.   The chef sent out a hot sauce he likes (Southern roots) when I asked for a second round. Delicious!!  Service was fabulous. Fast, friendly, helpful.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Happened to stumble in for karaoke night with a very friendly crowd. Everyone was having a good time enjoying the delicious food."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place for wings and beer. They offer a great selection of sauces and rubs that can appeal to any pallet. The place is somewhat small, so do not expect the elbow room you may have at BWW, but the quality of their food more than makes up for it.   Tip:  Do NOT try to show up mid afternoon during football season and expect to get a table. They fill up at the start of the early games and will remain full all day."}
{"text":"Love it here.  Buffalo Gold French fries are amazing.  Huge portion.  Enough that I take leftovers to my college kid.  Her eyes always light up.  Great atmosphere.  Fun, simple place to hang out.  Food is delicious.  Happy hour specials and newspaper coupons are great."}
{"text":"The waitress was nice. The place looked very dirty. The decor needs help. This place would be a favorite for the drunk. The food is not worth the price you pay. I was looking forward to visiting local establishment. I should have walked away. I believe in supporting local business, however, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great little spot! Wings are awesome! Some of the best and great flavor choices. Staff is always friendly and service has been great. Check 'em if your in the area!"}
{"text":"The Customer service was good but sadly the food there we ordered wasn't so good..the chicken tasted very dry and the mac n cheese tasted like it had been soaked in grease. We also got a salad which was the only decent part about this meal, but will never be returning & would not recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"The waiter Wayne is great!!! Worked his butt off!!! The place was super crowded, maybe needed more help???...Food took a bit of time, and wait staff seemed to be overwhelmed.(My reason for the 4 stars)The wait was worth it, food was DELISH and Hot! The wings are great. We ordered the Deluxe French Fries (forget the correct name) as an appetizer and it was well worth it!!! Our fav!!!"}
{"text":"Great place!!! Fantastic atmosphere!!! Food is also very good! Very nice job during lunch hours as well if you need to get in and out!"}
{"text":"It is spectacular! But you should really change your name I get uncomfortable saying this name. The service was good, but there cheese curds were better if its ur first time order those. But please change name and some waiters/waitresses had a bit of an attitude"}
{"text":"We come in about once a week. They specialized in wings and burgers. Their wings are so good, that we have not yet tried the burgers yet. They have so many different sauces to choose from, I like the insanely hot and the sweet chili the best. I also like the Thai peanuts as well. Ghost death is indeed deadly hot, I was only able to finish one. This place also has their own brew beer called booty's brew for $1.75 anytime of the day, taste like bud light. They also have $0.99 kids meal special on Tuesdays and $0.60 wings on Wednesdays. Small place, but staffs are very friendly, never once messed up my orders, half of this place is dining room, quipped with high chairs, half is a bar set up for grown up, they also have country live band and karaoke on certain night. Tried the tailgater pizza and wings restaurant/bar place across the street, completely disappointed. I guess once you have bootys wings, you will be here all the times."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Booty's... the wait staff is impressive, the smiles are genuine, they are knowledgeable and you really feel like part of the family.  Confused over wing sauce - ask for samples - the girls (I haven't seen a guy waiter yet) will bring you samples of the different wing sauce.  We love the atmosphere, whether its Karaoke or the jukebox its great!  We usually get wings (bone-in for him, boneless for her) and a burger.  Booty's has quickly become our favorite hangout.  Check out the booty-brew.... a great price every day all day long and booty-brew is good!"}
{"text":"Prices seem pretty good, we ordered the wings which were good as well as variety of sauces.  Did not care for the fried mushrooms which had a layer of oil at the bottom of the basket."}
{"text":"Had wings and fries. Besides the weird smell when you walk in, the food was pretty good. I'd go back for the wings for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here and did not like it.  I thought with the name it was a play off of a Hooters type but with butts.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The staff is very sloppy looking in my opinion.  We both ordered draft beer and it was not very cold and was very flat, and not to mention our pints were not even filled up.  We did not even finish our beers.  The bartender who waited on us was terrible as well and not friendly.  The decor is very juvenile.  Looks like peel and stick stickers from when I was a kid.  Very generic.  This is not for us and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years. Wings, loaded fries and mushrooms are awesome. Beer is always cold which is fantastic in the hot AZ summer. Unfortunately there've been multiple issues with service. Typical for long waits for refills & orders. Maybe management should consider adding another server to the night shifts so customers don't hear, \"sorry, she's slammed\""}
{"text":"Although this place may have the worst name for a restaurant   the wings are good. If you wanna be tough I dare you to order even one of your wings with \"ghost death\" sauce.  Weeoo doggie probably the hottest thing I've ever eaten.  Also 1.00 bootys brew.  Cold a/c n cold drinks"}
{"text":"No real competition and some TVs make this place bearable.  I wouldn't in good conscience let a friend drink beer from their taps or eat a meal here though."}
{"text":"Try the mango bbq wings. They're amazing! Great service. Fun atmosphere. Great happy hour specials too!!! Highly recommend to anyone in any age group!"}
{"text":"Good wings over all not bad, needs more area small and compact. But neat and clean. There isn't that much more I can say not a huge memory maker here but good food, good drinks so over all 4 stars here!"}
{"text":"I got a bbq burger and chips w/salsa. The burger patty itself was good but everything was so greasy, the bun was useless and the bbq sauce degraded the overall taste of the burger. The chips/salsa were ok. The hostess did more for me than my server which was disappointing. The tip should have gone to her."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!! You would think that for a wing place they would know how to cook wings!!! I was into my 4th wing when I look it was under cooked!!! Unbelievable!! Never ever going there again!!!"}
{"text":"Booty's have freshened up the old Scoreboards. Friendly servers, good beer selection and the wings are pretty darn good. I prefer boneless and these are meaty and lightly breaded. The garlic parmesan - Hot - was our favorite by far. We had fun mixing up sauces and rubs for tasty combinations."}
{"text":"I am sad when I read a good review and they are only given 3 stars, to me that's mediocre.    We have yet to have bad service and their food is really good.  On Monday we tried out their $6.99 burger special and I had the Bleu Cheese burger and hubby had the Cali Club, both were fab!  Their burgers are so big that the other half went to work with me the next day.  Great value, good staff and friendly interactive owners.  Standing my gorund on the FIVE stars and again happy they are in our neighborhood!  Not sure why, but Yelp filtered my review...rude!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the very best wing places we have been!  The selection of sauces is phenomenal.  Always greeted at the door very friendly. The variety on the menu would please anyone.   Service is about as good as it can get - always someone around when you need them and very courteous. We are wing fanatics so we always ordered them and fries.  Would of loved to try some of the sandwiches which looked amazing. Hats off to Booty's!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Booty's several times now and have enjoyed every visit. The sweet red chili wings are AMAZING. I haven't experienced slow service or long wait times on my food. My only complaint is the live bands that they have in there at times. I enjoy listening to the music, but they are always WAY too loud for that small of a space. You can't even hear the person sitting right next to you.  Also ... we were told by our server that \"Booty\" is the owner's nickname. I saw a few reviews below talking about the name and that they thought it referred to the server's butts."}
{"text":"Great place to go to. This was the first place we went to when we first moved out here 8months ago. We went on trivial night and it was fun. Looking forward to going back"}
{"text":"Didn't get greeted when we walked in. Floors were sticky. Table was dirty. Water taste like crap. Watched the whole first half of a soccer match before we get our food which was ok. Ordered 10 piece wings. I will not be going there again. Only Positive thing was the multiple tv's different games on. Rate half a star."}
{"text":"Service was good and friendly. Tom and Jerry, the band, wasn't bad either. But my Kilt Lifter wasn't cold enough, the Booty Wing Dip wasn't good, stuffed mushrooms were ok, loaded fries also only ok. Overall wasn't my cup of tea, probably not coming back.."}
{"text":"Sat down at the bar for over 10 min without being acknowledged. Saw maybe 2 servers on the floor. Understaffed so I left."}
{"text":"I had the worse experience ever! Do not come to this place. The food is ok but it's the workers that will bring this company down. 5 stars down! Took over 45 mins to get our food to us once it comes out the order is wrong. Just awful, don't waste your hard earn money. Maybe they will get some new management soon and that could retrain all their employees."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to drinking good beer in a laid back bar. The beer was good! The service was friendly! But we probably won't come back because it smelled SO bad. I think they were experiencing problems with their plumbing. Whatever it was, imagine trying to drink an ice cold beer while breathing in egg, diapers, etc. It was gross. Someone please tell me if this is a regular problem or just a bad day!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about.. Their boneless wings are too crispy and buffalo gold sauce is ehh.."}
{"text":"Decided to check out the new spot for us locals of buckeye and was very impressed w the live band, I love live music, sat at the bar, our favorite spot but it took over 10 min for a bartender to greet us much less ask us for our order, then we were asked if we would like a menu, yes, and they never came back to ask if we wanted to order - an hour later. So we took our tab paid and left to the next spot. Please work on your customer service much attention is needed. HAPPY VALENTINES DAY"}
{"text":"Best wings in surprise. We order Togo and the fries get soggy and gross but other than that. We've always had great food and staff"}
{"text":"Before I blast this place I wanna say that it's sad because the food was really good until I saw the filth:    1.   The service sucked balls.  The waitress never came back to refill my wife's drink or my son's drink.  She was to busy flirting with steelers guys.  The table to our right even said she was horrible.   2.   The food was good but to serve wings on a beer tray that is dirty underneath the paper is discusting.    That's like serving a great meal on a trash can lid.   That's a heath hazard number 1.   3.   We ordered fried pickles and fries and the baskets that they are served in haven't been cleaned ever.....look at them when you eat there.   You'll stop eating.  It's horrible. Health hazard 2.   Pic 4.  They really need to clean the beer nozzles and beer lines.   I ordered a coors light and it had a horrible not crisp taste.  I used to own a bar and restaurant and that is complete bad management.   Plus to serve a 2nd beer in a soapy glass is bad as well.  The third beer never made it to the table. 5.  Clean your restaurant.  Oil on the walls and fingerprints all over the window.   6.  When we showed up....where is the entrance?  Brutal. But we found it.     I really wish I could go back but my wife said never again.....clean it up and maybe one day.     Positive:  I did like the wings I ate and probably the best wings I've had in a long time.    I just couldn't finish when the filthy tray was pointed out.   Place just needs some management."}
{"text":"Best wings on the westside. Will drive the distance. Had Jamaican Me Crazy, parmesan hot, and honey hot. Wings are huge, meaty and full of flavor. Ask for extra crispy. Small place so expect a wait for peak times. Very good service too. Thank you."}
{"text":"We tried this place out with a craving for wings. I initially wanted to try this place based solely on the name! 'Ya'll wanna eat some bootys?' We tried the hickory bbq, the raspberry chipotle, and parmesian. And a side of the onion pettle. Oh my goodness! I loved the hickory bbq sauce they put on the wings, and also comes as the dipping sauce with onion pettles. I could eat them all day! I cant wait to come back and try all the flavors of wings and winning sauces."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their food is really good, especially their burgers. The atmosphere inside is great, and it's a fun place to hang out when they have karaoke going."}
{"text":"Customer service is really really bad on every ways. I dined in and did take out before. Everytime suck. Either they got my order wrong (boneless vs bone in) or they had me to wait another 15 mins after I called them 50 mins ago for ordering take out. This time I just ordered a take out.the waitress asked me to hold and placed me on hold for 10 mins until I hang up and called back. Then, the guy said oh the phone didn't ring I said because one of the waitress picked my call up and put me on hold for 10 mins until I hang up. Good food, service worst"}
{"text":"Best place for wings in Arizona great atmosphere great service good music....liked every wing I tried,great place to bring whole family happy hour everyday till 7"}
{"text":"The food is good, portions are excellent, the service is inconsistent.  We have had excellent service,  and we have had service that left us quite underwhelmed. The prices are quite fair, although the wings are a bit pricey, and to be honest, inconsistent as well.  My daughter and I went there and decided to try their award winning wings,and we were not impressed at all. We like spice and these just didn't live up to the hype.  We were there another time for a special event, and my son got some and they were fantastic.  Different cook? I don't know, maybe,  huge difference though. Good for a decent meal, at a fair price.  Only 2 real criticisms. .. the regular crowd seems to rule the roost at certain times, making it uncomfortable for new folks, and there is a definite odor. Perhaps a good steam cleaning is in order."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night with my boyfriend. It was pretty slow but service (although she seemed new) was prompt. Fish basket wasn't very good, the onion dips were good however and the buffalo chicken ranch wrap was OK. It just had a lot of lettuce hardly any chicken. Our drinks were good and came quickly. They actually have sweet tea vodka unlike many other places. Once empty server was quick to ask us if we wanted another. The beer was on special and they have great ALL DAY happy hour! Will be returning."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is friendly. It took us a long time to get our food and the bathroom need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"It's tuff to give 2 stars. I was torn because the service was alright. The food was average at best, the sliders tasted like Mcdonalds Cheeseburgers. I ordered wings which were good except for the fact they brought me one right flavor and the other flavor was wrong. I didn't say anything just disappointed my wings weren't spicy, they were a garlic flavor."}
{"text":"There isn't a better wing to be had in this state, and perhaps outside of upstate NY, the country! My family and I are here every other week and have been for years. Amazing wings, local and friendly atmosphere, quick and accurate service, and cold beer! Did I mention the wings?!"}
{"text":"The food was great.. (I got the booty burger) and the waiter was really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Best sea salt and cracked pepper wings ever! The blue cheese sauce needs improvement. I go with the ranch dressing. Fries and celery on the side, I tell them hold the carrots, and what a great meal."}
{"text":"I come here all the time , respectful staff . The owner Andy takes time from day at work to help a handicap regular eat food . He is such a great person and does this out of his kindness of his heart . I have never had a bad meal here . I personally enjoy the loaded fries extra wet . All around great place to watch games and enjoy live music ."}
{"text":"This is about the Buckeye location.  The first time we were there, I had wings--excellent--my husband had a hamburger and fries.  The hamburger was okay--the fries were limp and cold.  I sent an email to the owner about the fries--no answer.  I emailed him again and suggested that it would be politic to answer customers--no answer.  We did go a second time--wings for me and a hot dog for my husband.  The wings are excellent, the hot dog was very good, the kettle chips were good.    As to service--both times it was slow. The servers seemed to be rank amateurs.  I had to ask for water twice the first visit.  On the second visit, my husband asked for mustard and relish--he got mustard and ketchup.  He was finished with the dog before she came back with the relish.    Blaring music, poor service, poor customer care from the owner.  No need for me to spend my money there.  kaybee"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and we usually get Jake. Let's start by saying he's an awesome server so personable and always makes great suggestions. Food is excellent especially the wings."}
{"text":"Had salad, wasn't a exciting salad, but ok. Boneless wings were good. Decor needs something? I will go back."}
{"text":"Very sad to see inconsistent reviews. This food was the best \"bar\" food ever! The server was very helpful and attentive. We started with the loaded fries. They have wing sauce, ranch, bacon, and cheese on top of very flavorful fries. They were our favorite part and we couldn't stop eating them. The portion is huge and it is $2 off at happy hour so they were a steal! We got 20 wings and split if half chipotle and half parmesean. Our favorite was the parm and we fought over the last wing! The server also brought us two other sauces to try, her favorite, the sweet red chili which we are getting for sure next time, and the mango which was good but I don't think it would be on wings but that is just a personal preference, there was nothing wrong with the sauce.   The server kept our drinks filled without being asked which is nice when you are eating hot wings. Brought us plates for the bones and checked on us. Nice atmosphere. They had the games on and the patio looked nice for this cooler weather. Wish this was closer to home! But worth the trip to Surprise, AZ."}
{"text":"best wings in town and the prices are fantastic! all day happy hour!"}
{"text":"I ordered fish and chips.  The fish was mushy and gross, I informed the waitress, she would not take my food back and I had to pay for crappy food that absolutely nobody would consider eating. Don't go here unless you are planning on only drinking."}
{"text":"The food is always beyond fantastic so we go because they are my favorite wings. But the service the past two times has left something to be desired. The server always seems inconvenienced to have to be working. It took a good 10 minutes for her to come to the table the first time and we were there a total of 55 minutes before our food arrived and we were ready to order from the minute we got there. The previous occasion we almost left before getting someone to take our order. The bathrooms were also filthy the first time and had no toilet paper. The wings are amazing but not worth the lack of service recently. It used to be much better."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. The wings were just okay, I was the only lone female at the bar, and I felt the barstool wasn't very comfortable for the height of the bar.   Beer was cold, celery was fresh cut, but sloppy, and I liked their homemade wing sauce.   But I will return with others if I'm invited."}
{"text":"My fellow yelpers have not let me down... until Booty's.  Not sure if we just hit them on a bad night, or what, but my husband's Sedona Chicken Salad was inedible.  The service was totally clueless and disinterested in us.  They never even came back to see if we wanted more to drink, to check on the order, or anything at all.  Based on my experience I have to advise you find another place to eat, drink, and relax."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! This place is a winner. The atmosphere is chill. The beer is cold, the music a little loud for conversation, but I bet if you mentioned it, they'd turn it down a little. TV's are going, but muted so you can stay engaged in conversation but glace at what's going on in the world.  Service has always been good. Prices are decent. The food was excellent. I had the mushroom and swiss burger and it was done to perfection at medium rare. We went in with a group of about 12 and service was great (I'd called ahead and that may have helped).  I'd recommend Booty's for good food, cold beer and a chill time with your friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in to watch some college football after a road trip from Vegas, Fantastic Food , great house beer and plenty of game play for the content"}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone downhill!! Very sad this used to be my favorite place to go every week. The sad part is their food is great when it's great ..but when it's bad it's bad!! I reached out to bootys on their Facebook page about my bad experience (this is about the 5th BAD experience yet I kept going back) and whoever runs theor page could obviously care less!! Will NEVER be back.. sad because I love supporting local businesses but not when they don't care about their customers."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I thought the food was good and the homemade kettle chips were very good. My only thing is the place wasn't busy and I had to ask for a refill. For me service is key and I wasn't happy with having to ask for a refill."}
{"text":"Heard this place had lots of flavors for wings so thought we would give it a try.  The server was very friendly, but the time it took to get the food was disappointing.  Not impressed with any of the four flavors we ordered; though the wings were cooked fine.  The cheese fries appetizer was not nearly as good as the server seemed to think it was.  In any case, for the distance we had to travel to get there, would not go back.  Would stick with BWW's instead."}
{"text":"Nice music, the burger was tasty, cooked just right. The crown and diet coke was priced very reasonably and made with ample supply of alcohol. I will definitely go back...soon."}
{"text":"1st time at Booty's (Surprise, AZ) location and it will DEFINITELY BE THE LAST! Ordered the fried mushroom bottoms as an appetizer before we got our wings. When the mushrooms came out, there was a LONG BLONDE STRAND OF HAIR in it!! We asked to speak with the manager, when she came over she pulled the hair out & apologized. We canceled the rest of our order! NOT GOOD FOR BUSINESS! DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"I put 3 stars as the place is nice, good size, sports place with good food. BUT.....the salt n pepper dry rub wings are BOMB!!!!  I always order another order before I leave. They are killer dry rub wings. Love 'em."}
{"text":"Friendliest place I've been in a while:) thank you surprise for Bootys! The live music 3 nights a week is amazing!"}
{"text":"Waitress told my husband over the phone we could utilize the$0.60 wing Wednesday and take it to go, if we came in and say at the bar and ordered. So that's what my husband did because we have a 3 week old baby.  We like boneless wings. That's what we ordered. So the bartender (owner apparently) got the order wrong and put in for bone in wings instead of boneless. When my husband told him it was wrong, he got an attitude and then told him he couldn't take the wings to go for the Wednesday price. He then proceeded to argue with my husband... He eventually refunded my husbands money including the beer he had and when my husband was walking out the door yelled \"I hope you enjoyed that beer. It was on me!\".  You're a dick Andy. We won't be back and will be telling everyone we know about what happened."}
{"text":"Servers have no ideas what refills are. Manager was so busy flirting with the girls at the bar I could have walked to the place next door and gotten a beer and walked back and he would have never noticed. And it seems like the kitchen staff were on a break as it took forever to get our food."}
{"text":"First encounter: ordered 6 dozen wings over the phone for a pickup for a party.  I asked the waitress what sauces they had and she says \"we have over a dozen different ones\".  So, what are they ?!?  She says \"well, they are on our menu\".  Uhm, okay, but I'm on the phone in my car and I don't have telepathic vision!  After a few back and forths she finally goes and gets a menu and reads me the sauces list.  So I order.  I ask her how many sides of ranch will come with the order.  She replies \"two\"  For 6 DOZEN wings ?!?  I tell her I would like to have at least 6 sides and she replies that she is going to have to charge me 50 cents for each one over 2.  I wanted to hang up at this point but I decided to be patient and explain to her that if I was dining in the restaurant, they would serve me 20 sides of ranch if I asked for it without additional charge.  So she goes and asks her manager and comes back on the phone to say \"well, we will do it for you just this one time\".   Really?  Bad service for sure.  Anyways, the wings were decent (certainly not great) so I chalk it up to a bad server and decide to give this place another chance.  Went in on a Wednesday night about a month later for hot wings and a beer.  Place was dead, it should have been my first clue.  Waiter was nice enough, we place our order.  I specifically ordered wings with sauce on the side.  Takes 20 minutes but finally the wings come out, drenched in sauce.  I point this out to our waiter and he says \"oh, my bad, I will have them fix it\".  I wait another 20 minutes for a new order of wings.  My daughter is now already done with her meal.  The food finally comes out and the waiter tells me \"we're going to go ahead and take care of this for you\". When the check comes though, they ended up discounting the wings by $2.  Really? I call the waiter on it and he proceeds to argue with me \"but we did bring you another order of wings!\"  (oh, yes, and I've been waiting a total of 40 minutes for my meal now) So I call the manager over and he says: yes, we did discount it, we took 10 percent off.  Let's talk for a second about the fact that you ruined a nice anticipated family meal.  When he saw my reaction, he said \"well, what would you like me to do?  Tell me what you want and I will do it.\"  Hmmm.. lets' see... I would like you to own up to your mess-up, take the cost of the wings off my check and pretend like you care about your customers and have a clue on how to run a restaurant.  If this had happened at Applebee's or Chili's or Old Chicago or any of the dozens of places that serve bar food in the valley, they would have fallen all over themselves to try and make it right.   I paid the full amount of the check and left zero tip, which is a first for me but they deserved it.  Needless to say we will not be back. My guess is that this place won't last much longer."}
{"text":"We went here because it was the only thing open still serving food. The service was terrible. (But the bartender was very nice) We had the sliders and they were terribly over cooked. The fries were way over seasoned. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Place is clean and service was good, a plus.  Bar atmosphere serving families which is a little odd.  I had the M.O.S. burger.  It is a good 4-5\" high-a little daunting to eat.  Good flavor, though I ordered medium and got well done.  I would go back, but not on the \"A\" list."}
{"text":"Great wings & like the atmosphere.  Had one bad experience but overall I like this place.  Will go back again with both friends and kids."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of rubs and sauces for wings. The fries are also extra crispy and nicely seasoned. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We have been going here for wings for a while now, and love the selection  of  sauces, but the chicken tenders  (which  were mine and my son's  favorite) have really  taken a turn for the  worst.  I am sad to say that they  are terrible now and i didn't  even eat mine. They are TINY strips of chicken that  they are much more breading  now than  chicken and the  breading is not good. I like their wings, and their loaded fries  but will not be getting the  \"chicken tenders \" again. I hope they  bring back the  ones they  had a year ago. I'm  sad about it."}
{"text":"I was amazed by the taste of the wings. Looks like a typical sports bar, not anything fancy...just my type. I asked the server how good the wings were and he pointed to all the First Place trophies from Buffalo NY wing compensation. I will be back. Took 50 wings Togo back to my employees too."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars for a combination of their food, service and ambience.  Our son had a small wedding nearby and after the service a few of us said we'd like to go to Booty's to eat and celebrate.  It turned out that 28 people wanted to all go. We walked in with no notice or phone call and asked for seating for 28 people and in return they said give us 10 minutes.  Even though they were somewhat busy they some how accommodated all of us.   To make it even harder for them we had about 15 separate checks.  Drinks were promptly brought out followed by appetizers and dinner without much of a wait.   Their beer is always ice cold and fried pickles are good but the Buffalo Gold fries are awesome. Much of the family loves their wings and the sliders and tacos are very good as well.  I believe Jake is the manager and he always provides excellent service as well as comic relief.  He and the rest of the servers there are awesome and we always feel welcome every time we come in."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like it, but we weren't really that impressed.  Food was OK and less than OK and with as many rubs and sauces it's hard to really know on your first visit but it was either REALLY over coated or just not that \"great\".    I agree that the tables seemed \"sticky\" as others mentioned, they have no shortage of TV's which is great but not enough for us to drive back out to try again."}
{"text":"The food was not the best. We ordered the bootylicious dip because it was on happy hour and it tasted like something that I could have made myself at home in my Crock pot for a dip on nfl Sunday's. Not saying it was bad but it wasn't restaurant quality. My husband ordered the traditional wings which were a decent size but they gave him the wrong sauce on his wings on half. I ordered the sliders... fries were slightly over salted but that wasn't my big issue. My issue was the fact that these sliders were overwhelming topped with a mustard type sauce that made them taste like something from fast food. The saving grace was the service was good. I'm not sure if we will be back to try this place again."}
{"text":"Best wings in town, large beer selection and all the sports you can watch.  We visit every time we are in Surprise!!!"}
{"text":"Moved to Arizona from pittsburgh and was so disappointed with the chicken wings...until i found booty's. Their wing sauces are unmatched, appetizers are solid, and service is good. Buffalo chipotle garlic wings are phenomenal. They have the nhl package so I can watch my pens and occasionally live music. Great place for wings and the game!"}
{"text":"So many flavors of wings. The goal is to try them all but it's hard when the signature ones have won awards for their taste. Also, fair prices for the wings and beer!"}
{"text":"We were here on a Friday evening, the music was too loud and just plain weird at times. Our servers name tag said jemma or something of the sort but she pronounced it differently. I wish I was able to hear what she said or else I would be calling the manager. She was friendlier to my husband and showed WAY too much cleavage, even my husband said he was uncomfortable. I know the namely the place is \"Bootys\" but that doesn't mean I want to see your nipples. She was really slow and we caught her, several times, on her phone and goofing off with other employees. There was a small group of people that came in and she hugged them, so I'm assuming they were her friends. She spent most of her time hanging around them. Even to the extent that another sever, Wayne, had to start helping her despite him already being swamped. He was very polite and helpful! My husband and I salute you and your hard work Wayne!!"}
{"text":"Ask for Zack. He is by far the most fun. He is genuinely exited to be here and make your experience fun. Pretty good selection of beer, the wings are amazing and it is a family oriented place. I love it."}
{"text":"I went to the National Wing Fest in Buffalo this past summer and tried my first Booty Blast wing from Bootys and it was hands down the best wing I've ever had. I've lived in Buffalo for the past 5 years so I've had my fair share of pretty good wings- these Booty Blast wings are the bomb, seriously! When I visited their Surprise, AZ location I just ordered the wings to go so I can't really comment on the service but the staff was very friendly. They also offer a variety of other food besides wings. I recommend them!"}
{"text":"Let me clarify that this is for the NEW location in Buckeye.   I was REALLY disappointed.   Upon walking in, the odd smell was sooo unappetizing. I don't know if it's because of the recent construction or what but holy yuck, the smell.  Our waiter seemed relatively young and very inexperienced. He had 3 tables. He consistently ignored us and the table next to us. He spent most of his time socializing with a family at his 3rd table. We have his name but we won't call anyone out like that. He was nice, but he really needs to learn his job.  It took almost 40 minutes to get our appetizer. The Bootylicious dip w/ the chips. We had to call the bar tender over to ask for a menu  and then use the menu to point out to our waiter that what he served us was NOT the dip described in the menu.  No cheese at all, no sour cream no guacamole. It was literally just a bowl of chili and some chips. He had to bring the menu to the kitchen to talk to them about it. Came out a bit later with a little cup of sour cream and some BROWN guacamole. .. BROWN....!   Brown = old, not fresh.  The older couple next to us, who had been there longer, FINALLY got their order. This was after another waiter finally stepped in and started helping them and us.  Our waiter was back with the 3rd table, sitting in a chair at their table talking with them. He was there 15 to 20 min at a time.   We ordered 15 boneless wings each. They finally came out, my hubby did not like his at all. He ate one and shoved them aside mentioning that he would bring them home to see if he could pass them off as chicken nuggets for the kids.  My wings were ok. Not great but ok.   We only ordered water to drink but the smell and taste of the water brought back memories of drinking out of the garden hose in the back yard... yuck.  Tasted like salted metal. Even asked for lemon and that did not help. THANK GOODNESS the waiter NEVER once refilled our water. I wouldn't have drank it anyway.  We kept watching as the employees would head out the front door one or two at a time to go smoke, including the hostess and bar tender, while customers were waiting to order, get food, drinks, etc.   After just over an hour we finally got the bill, put our card in and .. BAM,  waiter disappeared back at the 3rd table. He was seated and talking to them again. We waited OVER 20 min for the OTHER waiter to finally take our bill and yell at our waiter to come take care of it.  All the while the other waiters, hostess and bartender were wandering in and out to smoke, standing all in a group at the bar chit chatting etc.. while CUSTOMERS WAITED TO BE FED, PAID ETC....!!  Needless to say, this was a total and complete waste of our time and money. We will NOT be going back and will definitely pass the word along."}
{"text":"First time here...wanted someplace new...not impressed at all...matter of fact I wont come back...service is slow...freezing inside...pretzel bites were burnt... my drink was warm and the large screen is not clear...enough said"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm. By far my favorite wing place! Their prices are reasonable and they send out coupons pretty regularly. Bonus! Booty's signature sauces are unique and delicious. The waitresses here are friendly and I often see some of the same people (customers and employees) which I like! You don't get that very much these days. I highly recommend Booty's."}
{"text":"Great place to come and get wings, They always treat my family and I with respect whenever we dine in! We always come Wednesday nights for their awesome wing specials! The food and all of their wing sauces are delicious. I Highly recommended you to come and try this place out !"}
{"text":"Some of the best wings in the area, especially the boneless ones. But, the service leaves something to be desired. Always slow, and drinks are hardly ever refilled. BUT the gold fries are to die for."}
{"text":"My in laws are in town and wanted to stop here today.  The menu has changed and they have added some new stuff to the menu.  They also have signs up to keep the riff raff gang banging bikers out.  This place seems to be taking an approach for a more family/sport oriented type of neighborhood hang out.  It was $70 for the 4 of us to eat and that was without any alcohol on the tab.  The atmosphere seemed much more inviting though and our waitress Alicia was cute so that was a plus.  Still not my first choice in places to go."}
{"text":"We walked in aroundaround 6:30 last night Wednesday the bar area was completely empty with the exception of a couple people saving seats for trivia night, we came in for some beer and food and got turned away from a half empty restaurant! Waste of time."}
{"text":"Alright... As my first review i am not trying to give out stars.. Our firste time here (my wife and I) was not that great. Service was ok.. Drinks were given promptly. BUT, the food order took a bit. Now, since we live just down the street, the past 2 times here have been great. The wings are crisp, and meaty. I absolutley LOVE the Insanely hot wings. They are freakin awesome.. period.. we ordered fries to split with our wings and they conveniently put them in each of our baskets (one order). We also got our correct dipping sauces (a welcome sight since most places screw my bleu cheese order up). Definitely try the HOT buffalo garlic parmesan and the buffalo gold. Next time I am going to bite the bullet and try out the ghost death wings... Wish me luck!!"}
{"text":"For a place that specializes in wings, I was not very impressed. I had a to-go pickup order. Granted, it was a Friday evening and very busy, but the food was sub-par.   The loaded fries were really good! And so was the macaroni salad. But paying $2 for a tiny condiment dish of mac salad??! Total rip-off. One would expect a side dish at that price to be feeding more than 3 bites.   I love the VAST variety of flavors they have for their wings! And the option of bone-in or boneless. However, the wings were WAY overcooked! To the point where they were so tough I actually thought I was eating part of the bone, which was pretty gross. And the sauces- they WOULD be good if it were more than just a drizzle that coats a small area of one side. They basically threw overcooked wings in to-go boxes and did a little drizzle of sauce. Totally disappointing for the price paid.   It was nice how the guy at the front made sure the order was correct before the patron leaves. But I feel like I overpaid for really sub-par food that was poorly cooked and carelessly thrown together. Can't say I will be making another to-go order anytime soon. Even Native, who has gone downhill, does better than this with takeout. It is a bummer, because the one time I dined in at Booty's, it was really good."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after I found out they had Four Peaks Kiltlifters on draft. That's always a big positive to carry the local beers instead of the normal Bud Light, Coors, etc collections. When we walked in the door the band that was playing greeted us, which was cool. Almost no wait time to sit down very nice for a Friday night. We ordered the Buffalo Gold Fries and some wings(Buffalo Garlic Parmesan and Buffalo Gold). The fries were pretty amazing and very filling and the amount is quite generous. The wings were also very good i'm a big fan of the Buffalo Garlic Parmesan. It's a very interesting flavor and not something i've found around Phoenix. Our server was friendly and kept our drinks full which is all I can really ask for. The only constructive thing I might suggest is for them to check out the Soda machine, I think the mixture of syrup to carbonation is off. This isn't enough to scare me off as a customer and Ill be returning in the future as long as this place keeps everything up."}
{"text":"We went here for beer and wings on a Sunday night. Destiny was our server and she was great! The wings were crispy how I like them and the fries were just as phenomenal! I loved it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Wings.... many places say they do them \"right\" this place does them justice. Award winning? I asked about that and they have placed quite a few times in different categories at the National Buffalo Wing Contest in Buffalo NY. I even checked the website and yep, winners. Now for the wings: medium were cooked that extra 30sec to make them crispy (which i like) and covered in succulent slightly spicy medium sauce. Yummy. The other wings tried were the salt/pepper dry rub. Also dried just right and good rub covering. The bleu cheese dressing is house made and good with chunks of bleu to hep tame the spice. Cannot wait for a return visit. Really really good wings. There are plenty of TVs on different channels and lots of sports flags, fatheads and one special clock. The servers welcome you when you enter and deliver great service. Clean bathrooms and plenty of paper towels. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a new place to try , and happened run across this place ... at first I was like this would be the perfect place to watch football !!! we ordered two sliders it took about 30 minutes to bring them out ... once brought out , we noticed that the sliders were not the correct ones so we waited another 20 minutes for them to bring out a freakn BLT ! I completely understand when a restaurant is short staffed by that wasn't the case ... we literally spent 2 hours here ,we ordered a root bear float ... we got root beer with no ice cream ....the food was actually good especially the dessert , sadly I can't say that about the service ..."}
{"text":"The music being played is awful. I'm one of three customers at 11:35 AM on a Wednesday. I'm scared to see what awaits me. There are lots of flies. Lots of TV screens and nice staff so far. No way can they afford being open with no customers at this time of day. I didn't want fast food. Now I'm regretting not going to Taco Bell for lunch.  Okay, my food came. I ordered the Cali-Burger. I didn't like the bun. The meat lacked good flavor and the fries were terrible (really just sopping with grease).  I asked for the WiFi password and was told \"because of the credit card machine even I don't know that!\"  Um, okay?   I give this pace 5 months unless they make serious changes.   Bottom line, my lunch sucked. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good and the happy hour was a good price. As far as the food goes..... you get what you pay for. The wings were like Tyson chicken nuggets with sauce poured on top. It wasn't terrible but the good service is the main reason it gets a 3 star score."}
{"text":"Some of the worse wings I've had, doesn't finish them, left and went next door to order a pizza and they gave me free wings after hearing how bad of a taste I still had. Only thing I could day was at less the server tried to help."}
{"text":"Honestly this place has potential because the food is great but the staff sucks. And that's being polite. Put in our order, waited a good 30 minutes to be served & once it came to our table it was the wrong order. So we had to wait another 30 minutes for the right order. Again waiting another 30 or so minutes for the waitress to process our payment."}
{"text":"Four stars because 2 out of the 3 flavors were excellent, 3rd was too much. Tacos were good, service was outstanding. Will eat here again"}
{"text":"Awful service.  They seated us and brought us menus and the forgot about us.  We waited 15 minutes, more people  came in and were seated and they had their orders taken while we were ignored.  We got up and left, no one noticed!"}
{"text":"46 minutes sitting at the table and our waitress FINALLY brings the food out. As she takes her hands out of my salad I can visibly see the black \"gunk\" under her fingernails. Nobody came to check on the food or if we needed anything, nobody offered to refill our drinks. In fairness, there are 2 waitresses covering the bar, dining room, hostess stand and doing all of the bussing of tables so simple things like washing hands seems to have been disregarded.notice in the photo how there's no employees?"}
{"text":"Came in on their grand opening night, and found cold beer and UFC fights on many screens. Sweet!"}
{"text":"Great wings. 70 cent boneless and bone in on Wednesday. Way better than bdubs. A ton of televisions with sports on but the place is a bit small. Bar atmosphere but okay for children. They give a military discount. They have a ton of different flavors so try each one. Service could be a bit faster but the wings are worth the wait."}
{"text":"Gold fries=so good! wings=AMAZING! Bootys food is all good, and reasonably priced. laid back atmosphere....service is so so...I mean ok- but not OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Went there a few Saturday's ago... sat on a table for about 10minutes.  They did not approached me during that time.  I saw a couple of people walk in, sat down and an employee greeted them.  I walked right out at that moment.  Poor service, perhaps they need more people to serve their customers.   I will think twice before going there again.    These impressions count, I hope the management does something, else people will take their business elsewhere.   I believe in supporting local businesses, I went there, I have choices, yet my impression then was not to go there again.   The place has potential to do better."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and the owners (Andy & Peggy) are exceptional at getting to know their guests making you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Living in surprise is hard to find a place to eat other than big restaurants names. Showed up on a Friday night they had a little band music was good. Very loud but had foot jams.  We tried the loaded fries and they were freaking awesome. Had tons of different flavors with all kinds of different toppings. The wings were really good had a sauce I never tasted. A little sweet little spicy little garlicky.  The fish fry was decent. The two things I would say to improve is get rid of the cold slaw. It's cabbage with tons of vinegar. And the seating was a little cramped to get around. Would go here to watch a football game. They seemed to have tons of specials during games."}
{"text":"Love the variety of sauces to choose from. Plus if you aren't sure about what you want....you can ask for a sample of the sauce! Apps are great & booty brew is cheap, cold and hits the spot! Love coming here when on this side of town."}
{"text":"Cool little spot in the city of Buckeye, I personally like the hot chicken wings. But great choices on flavors for the wings. Great cold beer and lots of TV's showing sports! Nice spot to catch a game drink some beer and eat chicken wings."}
{"text":"First time here was yesterday, had the wings and pickle chips which were pretty good. Definitely should have got to go, the service is very slow. I will probably give another chance but waiting 50 minutes for wings isn't my cup of tea. Wish I would have read the recent reviews before choosing to dine in."}
{"text":"First off our waitress is very bubbly!  Her name is celeste! Great personality just overall a great young gal. Saw her talk to customers next to us. (Older folks) she did very well! As I am in the automotive business and customer satisfaction is number 1! Food was good. My wife had a hot dog and I had a onion burger. We sat outside it was 70 degrees just a nice evening outside. Very pleased! I will be back. I will also recommend this place as well"}
{"text":"We are new to the area looking for a new place to have some eats. Took my wife and 18 month old after a long week. Kudos to them having 805 on tap.  Little disappointed with the food. Their onion petals are onion rings caked with batter that falls off...might want to rethink the recipe. The wings were over cooked,  the kettle chips tasted old and sitting under a  heat lamp. The thing that really irritated me...I order the Mac n cheese with fries for my toddler. The fries were so over seasoned with salt and pepper, they were barely edible by me let alone giving them to a baby to naw on. I was so shocked, I took a photo to share. So not ok for a child's meal. Didn't even eat them or take them home so str aight to the trash. Oh yeah,  on a side note, they charge extra for everything including extra ranch, o-ring sauce, etc. Clearly a small amount a restaurant needs to pay for ok service and food with over inflated prices. Might go back for happy hour as it is decent prices for adult beverages."}
{"text":"Booty's has become our dive bar must EVERY Wednesday night (date night).  We come here on the weekends sometimes with the kids as well. Saturdays they offer kids meals at a discounted price.  With 4 kids, we absolutely love it because we can take the kids out for a meal and still keep it affordable.   They have TV's everywhere... no matter where you sit, you can easily see at least 1 TV, no problem.  The staff is great, fun, funny, fast paced, respectful and attentive.   They sometimes have live music, karaoke, etc.  There is always something going on.    Everything here tastes good, but you GO FOR THE WINGS.  They are amazing and so is every sauce/rub we have ever tried.     The owner of Booty's is awesome as well. The restaurant is decked out in College and NFL football gear.  ALMOST every team is represented.  I am a Charger fan and gave him a hard time (jokingly) once about his lack of Charger gear represented.  He told me he would find something to put up, or if I brought him something he would happily display it for me.  We are getting ready to go back this evening.  If you are in or around the Surprise area, you MUST head in to Booty's for some wings, ice cold beer and fun."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting joint to review! First of all people! When there is about 24 first time reviewer, and they all give out 4 stars! Of course yelp is going to filter them! Booty needs to stop bribing people on their reviews! Just take your hits and learn from them, that's the only way of getting better. Now for my visit, I actually had a good time. First weekend of NCAA Football, wife kicked my out of the house, and I have never tried Booty's yet! I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I order a Land shark on draft. Drink went down ice cold and smooth! \"THERE DRINKS WERE COLD\" Yes there staff, tends to dress on the \"Trampy\" side. No! I am not calling them tramps!! But they can dress better! Most of us are not alcoholics, having marital problems, looking to get an easy night! I was seated very quickly, my waitress did have a issue of talking to customers a lot! So other help actually came by to ask for my drink, now the bartender was in a different zip code? Waitresses would give him a drink order and stand there until he finally decided to take their order? I had their jalapeno BBQ boneless wings! Had my order with in 15min. Had a very nice kick with a tangy taste, I loved it and will have it again! Burgers their looked very good, going to plan taking my wife their so she can try it out! There was nothing wrong with the decor! Just like any other sports bar. Booty's knows what they need to work on, hope they change a few things? Surprise is beginning to have a lot of competition, so listen up! your customers knows whats best!"}
{"text":"Being a black man I have an affinity for the derriere.  So when I heard of a place called Booty's.  I couldn't pass up the chance to go and check the place out.  So how was it?  It was kind of like the name of the place.  It was kind of booty.    My rating could change cause I didn't eat there, I ordered my meal to go.  It pretty much looked a bit more than a dive bar.  Which is nothing wrong with dive bars cause I enjoy going to those.  Some of the best people I've ever met or interact with were in dive bars.  The place was standard looking, nothing stood out or was unique about the place.  You know how Hooters has the owl theme.  Tilted Kilt has the Scottish look.  And Twin Peaks has the lumberjacks for their waitresses.  Booty's has nothing like that.    I will admit the food that I had was good.  I got the Badonkadonk burger with fries and it was nice and meaty like a badonkadonk should be :) The fries were pretty good as well.  But nothing stood out about them.  But for being \"bar food\"  it was above average.    The main reason for my rating was the smell.  As soon as I walked in there to order my food.  The place had a very foul smell in there.  It smelled.... and I hate to say it...but it smelled like urine mixed with Pine Sol.  Maybe they just mopped with dirty mop water or something.  But I was the only one that seemed to be effected by the smell.  Cause other customers came In and didn't seemed to notice at all.  But it wasn't like the place was packed. There was about 7 people total in the place.    I am willing to give this place another chance.  It does look like if you go with a group of friends to kick back and watch a game it could be a cool place. And the waitresses were really nice and friendly.    But if I have to give Booty's a booty score with 1 being Miley Cyrus booty (seriously, Google how flat that thing is.) And a 5 being Serena Williams booty (seriously Google how round that thing is.) I'll give Booty's a 2 which is below average to average booty score.  Which is probably equal to a Julia Robert's booty."}
{"text":"What can I say, you've got to go here and have some wings and a burger. Then you'll know why this place has been give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great wings with huge variety of flavors! Service was fantastic with a group of nine people. Certainly will return!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings, good prices on Wednesday nights. The service was good however the music is always way to loud. I would like to go more often but the noise keeps me away"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. We ordered beer and a burger the service was quick and polite. The burger came out hot and juicy. We will be coming back! We will also recommend it to family and friends."}
{"text":"The best wings on the west side, hands down! Award winning sauces (marked on the menu) and some great dry rubs! I usually come for $0.70 bone in wing Wednesdays or $.70 boneless Thursdays.   They have specials everyday. Today, Saturday, $3 drinks and $1 kids meals (1 per entree). Daily happy hour as well N-7. Sunday you can get 50 wings for $32!!!   Staff is always friendly and polite. Never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"Great place to come have good food and watch sports! They show all the sports, especially NFL, the food is good, the owners are awesome, and the atmosphere is friendly!"}
{"text":"We came to Booty's in Surprise on the recommendation from several people. Even though we read the recent bad reviews. We thought we would give them a chance. If I could give them zero stars I would. We were told 15-20 mins to be seated. That turned to over 30 mins. When we realized that our name was skipped over we told the hostess. She didn't even apologize so my husband talked to the manager. The manager didn't give a crap and took the hostess side. So we went over to Tailgaters. Where we were seated almost right away even though they had a full house. Probably will never go back to Booty's"}
{"text":"Just OK. Their advantage is being located in Buckeye, where there's not a lot of competition/options. Their wings are definitely bigger and better than other chains (BWW, etc) around the valley."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and plenty of TV's.  Beer is nice and cold and there are plenty of specials.  Burger was good and fries crunchy and nicely seasoned.  Overall, a basically comfortable place to watch a game and have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Food and service pretty good.  Had the chicken sliders and wings, lots of wi g flavors. We liked  the seasoning in the fries, not the norm."}
{"text":"Came to watch the NBA Finals and had so much fun Wayne is awesome!! Very attentive and funny! His service is top notch....he needs to be at this location more often"}
{"text":"Plenty O incompetent parents letting their genetically misfired offspring run around unchecked. Ate outside in hopes of having a conversation above the blaring music featured inside...it  was no different. The food was okay, had a bleu cheese burger and fries which was again, just okay. Ordered a craft beer for $8 which seemed ball park steep.  No reason to go back just incredibly average.  The sports bar next to it was packed however so that's my next endeavor"}
{"text":"Let's start with it's interesting.. I mean we walk in and there is a live band playing right as you walk in. So loud you can't even hear your own thoughts. It took the servers a little bit to notice we were waiting to be seated.   After we were seated we ordered our drinks everyone else had a beer. Which as someone else mentioned they do sell locally made beer which is super cool. I myself had an iced tea only to later trade it for a soda, not the best tea.   For the appetizer, which we shared between three people! The \"Loaded Potatoe Buffalo Gold Fries\" the portion was very good after we ate them we had second thoughts on ordering wings also. You should be aware that the fries sound like they might be spicy due to the buffalo sauce and jalapeños, but its rather sweet.   We decided to go ahead and order the wings. Again sharing 20 pieces of the boneless wings. Deciding to try three different kinds just incase we didn't like a flavor and be forced to eat more than we have to. We tried the parmesan garlic, mango, and the buffalo gold. The parmesan garlic was the best one of the three you can really taste the garlic in the chicken.    The reason why I didn't give Bootys four stars is because of the loud music. You can even hear the person next to you talk. The service was a little slow this might be because they're still new. If these things were to change I believe this could be a regular hang out spot for us."}
{"text":"The best wings on the West Side! Every time we come here, the food and service is the same....terrific!"}
{"text":"Great food!  great time!  Love their Honey hot wings!!"}
{"text":"This place is small, crammed, and way too loud! The food is awful. Overcooked and extremely greasy! Would not go back!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Blue Cheese burger...messy, but fun! Jake is very helpful and attentive! Bud on Tap!!"}
{"text":"Besides the amazing burgers and great wings, Broc  gave amazing customer service; will be back soon"}
{"text":"Hands down the messiest most amazing burger in Surprise. The sweet potato fries were served with this cinnamon glazed goodness, on the side of course. The sweetness filled in for that after dinner need for dessert. It was our first visit there but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for all you can eat Friday \"fish and chips\" this is the best place around by far, not to mention all the other great appetizers on their menu.  I've had fish and chips at the nearby village inn, black bear diner, and crooked putter restaurant. None of these places have better fish and chips.  Try them out for yourself today!"}
{"text":"Wings were great! Lots of interesting flavors which I like!  We went in today for the first time after friends were raving about the wings. I ordered jalapeño BBQ and they were delicious!! My s/o ordered Sonoran jalapeño which I wasn't a fan of it was like ranch and buffalo mixed together and of course regular hot. We also tried the death ghost and WOW they are hot!   The service was pretty slow saw like 3 tables who came in after us get their food before us and we even asked the waitress how much longer but we were a party of 7 so I wasn't bothered too much.  My final opinion is I will definitely be back especially on Wednesdays with their $.70 wings."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for comfort food.  My brother ordered the Original Booty Burger.  With a thick patty, onion ring, and other trimmings, I wasn't sure he could get his mouth around it to take a bite -- but he managed.  You can customize the burger any way you want, and he added grilled onions for 50-cents extra.  There are five regular side dishes to choose from at $1.99 extra, and five more for an extra $3.99, which is less than the price if ordered separately.   I had the Peggy Sue salad, a nice combo of usual salad mixings, and additions of pecans, blue cheese crumbles, and cranberries.   We went on Thursday, so the daily special was wings for 70-cents each.  I had 5 boneless wings with raspberry balsamic chipotle -- finger-lickin' good!    The service was very good, but a little slow because, at lunchtime, there was only one gal on the whole floor besides the bartender."}
{"text":"Went in for a beer and had a great time! Good deals and excellent service.    Wasn't able to sample the wings this time but I hear they are pretty amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner, they were short staffed and it took about 25 minutes before they even took our food order, but when they did they gave us $10 in Booty bucks and they took off the wings from our bill; we will be back. The food did taste good but the medium wings were on the mild side for me."}
{"text":"Its not really fair to give them a bad review on their \"grand opening\" night as it was obviously busy and crowded.  Give them a few weeks, then we'll see how they're doing :)"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the wings with a descent beer and liquor line up. Excellent service for a pub and plenty of TV's."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings ever. 12 time National Buffalo Wing Festival winner. You will like everything about this place."}
{"text":"This one star is being generous. The waitress who took our order forgot to take mine but then remember as she started to walk away. When the food came out it was over cooked.  Burger was dry and over cooked and not worth the 10.00 they charged for it. My fish fry was subpar. The fish was over cooked and the fries were so over cooked you couldn't eat them.  The cole slaw had no sauce mixed in with it. The topper of our quick evening was the drunk guy sitting next to us.  Every other word out of this mouth was the F bomb and my 13 yr old daughter was sitting there. Yes, it is a bar BUT it is also suppose to be a restaurant for everyone to enjoy. Needless to say my husband was going to take him outside and teach him how to be a gentleman. If we didn't have gift certificate for this place I wouldn't have gone there. 2 weeks before that we were there with 100+ bikers who behaved better than 2 tables that were in there tonight. We won't go back!"}
{"text":"It is obvious why this place is known for its wings!! I dont even like chicken wings but since trying this place, I have been getting cravings for them. When my husband was too lazy to make the drive and ordered from somewhere else, I was devastated, and drove out to Booty's the next day! Try the different sauces, theres like 40ish of them! the happy hour specials are awesome. 20 wings-fries-and 2 beers for 20$ perfect lunch for 2!!"}
{"text":"Gave this place so many chances and constantly disappointed. It consistantly smells like a backed up garbage disposal with a damp stank in the air. The tables are moist and sticky I assume that's why they keep rolls of paper towel on them. The wings are bland and served cold and completely drenched in their crap ass sauces. The burgers are dry and bland and a disgusting mess to eat. The pulled pork is bland and cold. The fries are alright. The atmosphere sucks unless you enjoy generic ass blues blasting in your ears. The service is slow but at least most the servers are pleasant when they eventually find their way to your table. Except the middle age bald dude who's smug and annoying as all hell. They have an alright beer selection. The men's bathroom has a urinal right next to the sink and mirror with no privacy barrier so you can see man meat while washing your hands. I'll probably end up going again"}
{"text":"Came across this place last year on our way to Spring Training. Great food, prices and friendly people ! Stop by you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We haven't been here for a while. But decided to give it a try again since my husband wanted a good burger. He got one all right. He had the badonkadonk. I love big butts and I cannot lie! Too many of those burgers and you will be singing that song! It was stuffed with yummy goodness. I had a salad...but it wasn't an ordinary salad. It had chili and queso, tortilla chips and guacamole. It was very filling and a little spicy. The kids meals are only $4.99 and come with a drink. Weekends have all day happy hour. Give this place a try, if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Despite some mixed reviews, wife & I decided to try a new wing place.   Glad we did! This was the 4th straight day  we had eaten at a grill/brewhouse restaurant and the food measured up with any of them.  Large selection of wings- and yes, the ghost sauce is VERY hot!  Slightly disappointed the country music got changed to the football game, but it's a sports bar and it was easy to ignore.  Beer selection was decent, personally like more microbrews.  Server was attentive; and definitely suggest trying the \"chocolate peanut butter thing\" for dessert. (that's what they call it!)"}
{"text":"Doesn't feel the same as the Surprise location. Not bad and best option for wings in the area."}
{"text":"The wife amd I decided to stop here for lunch. The staff was very welcoming and made us feel at home. We were the only people in the place!  Normally this would make me leave but we were very hungry.  We both had burgers and beer. The beer was perfect and cold. The bugers were huge and had little or no seasoning. The frys were way over seasoned and soggy. The seasoning would be good if they used less.  Probably will not come back, there are other sport bars that are better."}
{"text":"My Best Friend was in town from Illinois, thought we would try out the new Bootys.  We were able to seat ourselves, the atmosphere was nice.. The food took a long time before served.  The wings were really good, I was not impressed with the over cooked fries.    The one thing that aggravated me the most was that we were still eating when they brought us our check..  Then a few min later came back asked if we were ready to pay.. No! This happened 3 more times, I'm eating my friggen chicken wings, I have sauce on my fingers, what the heck were they expecting me to do, drop my wing, dig in my purse to pay right away? Let me finish first!! She says I just don't want you to feel rushed.  Well what the hell did she think she was doing? Rushing us out the door!  The waitress was fine, but it was the greeter who rushed us and she's lucky she didn't ruin the tip for the waitress ...    Let's see how long this bar lasts in that location.."}
{"text":"Immature staff.  They have personal conversations in front of the customers about shifts and customers.   Food, is decent but they should hire decent staff..."}
{"text":"Always seen this place in passing, never knew they delivered and also never knew they were so delicious! The only reason I gave four stars is due to the five dollar delivery charge on top of ridiculous taxes but if ordering out and being lazy I get paying a delivery fee. However five bucks is extreme imo. But...the food was worth it. Gigantic burgers, the fries had a really good seasoning, soooo much food.... a tad greasy but it's a burger joint....that delivers! So happy we chose to order from here, now I know and will be grabbing food from here more often. There's a decent little variety, for burger and sandwich place. Know this, you'll be stuffed lol. Massive amounts of food. The typical plate is 9-10$ for burger and fries but there's so much food you could split it (if able to cut through the huge burger lol). Hope they stay open and in biz, seems a lot of surprise restaurants struggle."}
{"text":"The food here was great. I think my favorite was their fried zucchini! Yum! The sliders were tasty as well. Most importantly I have to say the service is excellent! Our server Mark was super friendly. We appreciated his humor and his attentiveness."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch on a Monday, and it was a really great experience. Service was really good. The food was awesome. We had wings and burgers, and every person in our party (5 people) loved their food."}
{"text":"We were seated pretty quick but it went down hill from there. waited for 30 min for the food. The waiter brought us a water and it tasted awful like it came out of a fracking operation or something. The burger was cold and didn't look like other burgers, like it was a kids burger or something. The wings were way over cooked dry and chewy with sauce poured over the top of them not tossed like they're supposed to. This food was downright terrible, no need to return to eat here.."}
{"text":"Staff was great. Food was great. Had some wings that were good, the pickle fries were fantastic, and the loaded fries were bomb too!!! The appetizers are huge probably good for three or four people if you're getting a main meals too..."}
{"text":"Budda bing budda boom!! Just your regular bar food, nothing special, tasted the food worse and better"}
{"text":"Every time I come here either with my fiance or just with THE BOYS, it's always a great experience. Amazing service by all servers.. Heather was the definition of a great server as she provided options for us when we were indecisive (BY WE I MEAN MY FIANCE)and was very tentative. Thanks again. Not to mention the food here..... Every dish we have had blows us away! Great food! KEEP IT UP"}
{"text":"We had a coupon buy one entree get one free so we figured why not! Ordered the mac and cheese bites, chicken fingers, and the cali chicken sandwich. The beer took forever to come out, after searching for our waitress for over 5 minutes we finally flagged her down and she had forgotten. Our appetizer was delivered to the table next to us we figured out and we were forgotten about. After hunting down our waitress again we finally asked about appetizer and she said let me check...brings out food and appetizer at the same time. My chicken sandwich was chewey and not the kind that is good. It appeared to be cooked, but something was wrong with it. The fries tasted as if they were just microwaved? I didn't touch my food and the waitress didn't say one word. Not only was the food bad the service was horrible. We should have gone to red robin."}
{"text":"Awesome wings and a super chill dive bar. Totally worth it to come and visit if you haven't already. The buffalo garlic parmesan wings are definitely the best."}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago, the beer is cold and all but the service is starting to dwindle a bit. We asked for water and we never received it, but we got more beer even though that wasn't what we had asked for. (Hard to complain about more beer I suppose) Wings are consistent, and tasty compared to the competition across the parking lot and the owner is there all the time which shows they are really trying to be a staple of our little community. Keep it up Bootys but get your service back in order."}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwich, good service and lots of tv's to watch sports. The help is spot on and they have a bunch of craft beers on tap"}
{"text":"More of a novelty than anything else. The wings come in many different flavors. I thought that they were mediocre at best and honestly pitiful for a place that should be able to make an incredible wing. Plus, I found it to be expensive for just wings. Might try again... maybe."}
{"text":"Great crispy wings! Good prices and cold beer. Numerous wing sauces as well. Skip the place next to it and go here for wings."}
{"text":"First time at Bootys! Had a regular bar food but tasted fresh. While there a live guitar player taking request.  It was a little loud for my liking. I had a hard time speaking with those that accompanied me.  Over all I'd give Bootys 4 out of 5 stars. Good food and great atmosphere. Would definitely eat there again. Family friendly."}
{"text":"For the second straight time, we had Wayne as our server and received outstanding service once again. He was extremely attentive and friendly. The spicy teriyaki wings were amazing. Another favorite of ours is the fried Zucchini.  One negative was the Caesar Salad. It was drowning in dressing and buried in croutons and parmesan cheese. It was completely uneatable. Outside of that, great food and an outstanding service."}
{"text":"The Buckeye location doesn't have a yelp page yet so I'll put this on here.  My husband and I checked out this new location and were excited to have a new choice for dinner. I was a bit put off by the live entertainment....not because it was bad...he was actually quite good....it was just very loud. But I was willing to overlook this. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server quickly. He asked if we had been there before and we said we had not. He sat down and went over the menu with us. So far, so good. We ordered our drinks and perused the menu. We then waited for thirty minutes while the entire waitstaff walked past us over and over again, not once asking if we had placed our order...even though we had menus on the table in front of us. We finally decided to pay for our drinks and leave. We stood at the bar for another ten minutes before we just left. Such a disappointment!!!!!"}
{"text":"So it's been a while since our last visit to booty's (more then a year). My son wanted to go for his birthday and WOW how the service has improved. We had a party of 6 and we're sat right away. Our order was 55 wings, 2 sides of fries, an order of mushrooms and a corn dog kids meal. It was a pretty busy Wednesday and took a little longer to get our food (I blame the corn dog). When the food came it was magical. Everything hot and fresh, nothing died under a heat lamp waiting for the rest of the order. The buffalo garlic flavor is now my favorite. I could do without the live music due to being such a small place, but will return without question."}
{"text":"Best fried mushrooms I've EVER had!! The raspberry balsamic chipotle and desert sweet heat sauces were amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food..prefer take out than dine in. Not really a place for kids. ..enjoyed the Sedona chicken wrap with their awesome kettle chips. Kids love the $5 burger...give them a try..."}
{"text":"This was an extreme disappointment. I ate at the original Booty's in Phoenix about two years ago and it was great, what happened I don't know but if you like Microwaved appetizers, Fired Cheese and Macaroni, or cheese sauce that was water downed, Pretzel Bites.  Then came the true disappointment the actual wings which were dry and smothered with some kind of gross sauce which was suppose to be BBQ Hickory. Well all this matches the service"}
{"text":"I went here for a UFC signing / return home party for Ben Henderson and I would defiantly return. The atmosphere was good and seemed inviting to bar patrons and the one beer I ordered came fast and friendly. The waitresses were friendly and well trained, and everyone seemed generally happy to be working there. I need to return for more than just drinks to give them a better review but I would suggest others try this place out if they are in the Surprise area."}
{"text":"I Went here Friday with my friend Kim.  The food was delicious and my waiter made awesome suggestions for drinks that I might like. I wanted to try something new, but when I did not care for it, I told him that I would like to order the drink I had last time. I could not remember it, and almost instantly he reminded me what I had. It was cool that he knew that from 3 weeks ago.  I dont come here often, but the food is great and the service is even better!"}
{"text":"A decent wing place. The sauces were pretty good but a good portion of the wings looked like they got a deal on the \"runt of the litter\" wings.  The Loaded Gold Fries were extra delicious but certainly not the healthy choice! Of course that's not why we went there.  Our server, Mark, was very friendly and helpful. He brought out a few sauce samples upon request and made a couple suggestions. BBQ Chipotle and Buffalo Gold. Both were quite tasty.  Beer was cold."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings! The Jamaican Jerk is amazing! Wish they would bring the buffalo bleu wings back because they were my 2nd favorite! Nice place to grab a beer too!"}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I've had. If you're look for hot wings though, don't go with the hot go with the crazy sauce. The \"hot\" we're more like mild. The burgers were good. Staff was a bit slow but friendly."}
{"text":"My husband and I have frequented Booty's and have never had a problem with the food or service.  The wings are really great and the service has been excellent.  We usually sit at the bar and the bartenders (Andy and Charlie) are fantastic.  We feel like home when we are there because everyone is so friendly just like a neighborhood bar should feel."}
{"text":"Nice bar/grill spot to hang at after work. Booty's has great wing specials on Thursdays and great drink specials everyday. I get the Cajun spicy mix dry rub wings and my classic gin and tonic. By $11, I'm tipsy and full."}
{"text":"Found this place after a royals spring training game.  It filled up fast about 5 on a Friday but then was thinning out by 7 or so. The happy hour specials were good.  Had the Thai peanut wings and they were yummy!  Just enough spicy without being too much.  Had the buffalo ranch salad and it didn't disappoint either."}
{"text":"If you are just going for the food/drink and to watch a game, you'll be fine and walk away happy.  However if you are hungry now, or have any time restraint what so ever, go someplace else.  I've been to a crazy number of restaurants in my 33 years, and this place is the s l o w e s t by far!  Our party of four all have various burgers, and the order still took about 35 minutes to come out.  That was also a Tuesday night!  How do they work under NFL Sunday conditions?  The food is good, the drinks specials were appealing, and the wait staff was very polite.  The thing is though as more competition opens around Surprise, this place will get passed by.  As it now stands this place has the \"slow service rep\", and that's hard to shake."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy coming to this place. However, I brought my parents on Monday and the service was terrible! From the hostess to the server...so much for my dad to say he will never return. It's sad since they just moved to Surprise. I'll be back because I know this is a great place,  just wish the get new employees"}
{"text":"My mom called in the day of the Super Bowl and ordered wings for the house, 40 I'm pretty sure. When we got there they were really busy (the game was just getting ready to start) but they had us checked out and our wings ready right away. Good service and the wings were delicious."}
{"text":"Our visit was awesome! Our waitress Karisa was so great. Her customer service was amazing, she was very patient, fast and so sweet! The only reason I am not giving five stars is because the wait for our food was longer than we expected. Our food was delicious, especially the wings! Aside from the wait, everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great beer and better wings! Can get a bit busy on the weekends which is expected since it's great. However regardless it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and sadly our last.  The wings were ok nothing else.  I had a delicious salad though.   The biggest issue was the ladies bathroom.  No soap.  The staff was informed and said they did not know how to open the dispenser and never went back to try.  I went back to bathroom again and still no soap or seat liners.  The no soap means that the staff could not be sanitary serving food and drinks.  Health code violation for sure and ick."}
{"text":"Came out to Avondale to visit family for thanksgiving. My nephews and I were looking for a place to see the Raiders play on Sunday, other than going to BWW, found this little gem. Brought my entire family, a total of 12 of us. A few things about this place made the visit special. 1st off, we were a big party, they quickly accommodated to our needs, 2nd they promptly changed the channel on one of the tv's near us so we can watch our game. 3rd, they promptly brought us water, and took our order quickly. 4th, they have a special of 50 wings, for $32.99, so we ordered 2 of them. 100 wings for $66, less than a $1 a wing, and on top of that, they were meaty. Not skimpy wings at all. And finally the service. It was freaking amazing. I wish I had gotten her name, but she did amazing! She took down our orders, was prompt with service, refills, and constantly checked on us to make sure we were doing good. Oh, and the beer, ice cold, served on ice cold cups! Looks like I found a new spot when go visit family in AZ."}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been to Booty's 3 times now. So, I think I have given them a fair shake. I really wanted to have a decent restaurant / bar nearby to patronize and support, but Booty's is not it. The food is okay and the wings are pretty decent. However, it is small, cramped, and the decor is drab. Yes, I know it's a sports bar, but it's not the type of place that makes you say \"Yes, I wanna be here\". The service is lousy at best. The wait staff are not very friendly (try smiling once in a while), and amateurish (their lack of experience shows through). Once, from the dining room, I heard the staff being yelled at to be faster with their orders. From what I can tell, most of the staff has quit or been fired. Doesn't look like a very friendly place to work or eat.  Now, Booty's is bribing customers with a free desert if they write, print out, and bring in a positive Yelp review. Positive reviews should be earned for great service, excellent food, and a decent atmosphere. Booty's does not possess any of these qualities. They have definitely earned this negative review."}
{"text":"We recently moved to AZ and we're craving some wings, so we ordered take-out. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they were. They were super friendly on the phone and very nice when we picked up our food. They must have forgot  our carrots/celery that came with our chicken wings but the taste of the wings made up for it. Can't wait to check them out when we have time to sit down and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"I have been to Booty's 3 times and generally the service sucks.  The second time I practically had to go into the kitchen myself to get some silverware.  And the place is called Booty's but no one who works there a has a good looking booty. ha ha The wings are really good though and event though you have to wait forever to get them it is worth it.  Every time we order no matter how busy or slow it is is ALWAYS take at least 30 minutes for wings.  It should never take that long to put wings on the table.  This last time that I went our waitress was pretty attentive but it still took 45 mins for our wings.  I can't wait until B-Dubs open again."}
{"text":"Always busy and always good! Tonight was another great dinner with the family and with it being Saturday we got our sons meal for 99 cents with a purchase of another adult meal. Tonight I really wanted to try something different so I ordered the Cuban sandwich. It was very good and a lot of flavor. The only thing I'd like better was if it was on different bread. It was too thin and toasted too much for me. I would eat it again though. My boys love the hot wings and rarely try anything new, but it's because they always tell me they're the best. My hubby tried one of the burgers and really like it. Bootys is definitely one of our favorites."}
{"text":"The wings were pretty awesome...however. My husband and I went on a Tuesday night and there were people at the bar and only 2 tables of people...so not busy at all. The server was funny but not very attentive as the food came out dry and cold. Normally I'm not one to give negative comments but...it was warranted."}
{"text":"Amazing wings. Biggest in the valley and great flavors. Blows bww out of the water. Highly recomend."}
{"text":"The menu never fails to disappoint, and the last time I was hear the table was actually sticky and disgusting."}
{"text":"Dang GENA!!! Of all the places I ate in the area this was by FAR the best authentic burger place anywhere !!! I had the Sonora chicken .. insane good! Trying to wrap my mind around the flavors that just went in my mouth! Chicken wings --there all good!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. The 2 times we went there it was a long wait for our food. On top of that they got my wife's order messed up both times. And the last time we went we waited about an hour to get our food and they gave a free basket of fries, cool? Got the receipt and charged us for everything. Ask for a military discount at least and they said no. Never again."}
{"text":"The waitress was not interested in doing her job. The food was just average and the restaurant looked more like a McDonald's."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is only 3 stars!  Probably based on the appearance but the food is amazing and I give it 4 stars but hands down the best wings I've ever had!!  If you're in town grab a cheap beer and some hot wings!  Their sandwiches are amazing too!"}
{"text":"I'll give a solid four :) the food and drinks are good. The variety of food on the menu is actually very friendly and expansive. There is a lot more than just wings here folks.  The sauces are uncountable since there is so many and the options as I have not tried all, but they all sound great. Service was whatever, could have been better but all and all....we will return, will try more food and sauces and food and will update if needed :)  good place though"}
{"text":"This place has the best wings in the greater Phoenix area. They are big and meaty. They come with tons of flavorful sauce and there are about 20+ sauces to choose from. I don't know how anyone can give this place below 4 stars the wings were amazing."}
{"text":"Took the family here for dinner. We loved the wings! Best wings in the area!! Hamburgers were huge and delicious.  French fries got thumbs up from the kids.  Blue Cheese burger had too much blue cheese but was still delicious. Definitely will come again."}
{"text":"Is it possible to give no stars? Service was horrible when we went in at lunch there was only two other tables. That was not the worst of it. Server treated us like we were stupid and we were given a menu \"if we wanted to order anything.\" My husband ordered the Peggy sue and I got wings and a side salad. Wings were great! Husband was picking at his salad and said it didn't taste very good. I tried a bite and it literally tasted like they ran it through the dish washer with the dirty dishes. I worked in food service for awhile and it even smelled like the dish water I remember from previous kitchens. Husband told the server it tasted horrible all she responded was I'm sorry. Well a few hours later my husband has currently barfed twice as of now. Nothing but the lettuce. I called to tell the manager she asked if I had told someone. Well ya we did, nothing happens and now I was telling her. Guess what we got again I am sorry and I'll get to the bottom of it. Didn't ask for my name nothing. Just oh sorry. Ya I'm sorry to that your food taste like you put it through the dishwasher and the servers were rude. My freaking husband is barfing up your food and all you can say is sorry. First time and last time in. Horrible managed and staff is rude."}
{"text":"One and done. We came here at the recommendation of someone from my husband's work but we are very disappointed. Both of the burgers were overcooked, chard burned on the outside and had absolutely no juice whatsoever. Completely dry. My husband's french fries were not hot. And to substitute sweet potato fries for regular french fries they charge $3.99. Which is ridiculous for that you should get an entire order not just a handful next to your burger. The service was mediocre at best, It took several minutes for the server to bring my husband melted butter, and I asked for catchup that never came. And we had to ask for refills on our drinks. It was definitely not worth $33. McDonald's would have been better. When it was the Irish pub the food was amazing. Too bad that's gone."}
{"text":"Eh. The wings were WAY over cooked. Honestly the medium buffalo wings that I ordered tasted like the cook had taken leftover salt and pepper dry rub wings and then applied a very non-generous portion of average tasting buffalo sauce. The beer selection is terrible but to be fare I'm from California where great tasting, craft beer is available everywhere. I've been here in the past when the atmosphere has been fun so it gets somewhat of a past. Still confused as to why the bartender (9/4/16 9PM) was claiming that the wings somehow were the best in the nation? Best in that small shopping center maybe......."}
{"text":"Went with entire family and found the food to be pretty good.  The garlic wings were very good.  The service was mediocre at best; however the food was at the right temperature so the issue mush have been in the kitchen.  The biggest cause of concern was the lack of repair on chairs and a heavy metal gate on the patio.  An adult member of our party got her fingernail smashed because the cushion with a wood backing was not screwed or bolted to the heavy metal frame of the chair and as she was moving forward inadvertently got her finger caught.   A subsequent check found multiple chairs like that.  This dangerous lack of attention is inexcusable.   The heavy metal gate was also missing bolts to the hinges and is one swing away from a smashed foot.  All it would take is a couple screws per chair and a couple bolts for the hinges.  Had it been a young child getting their finger caught on the chair it could have been much worse!  Booty's take care of your business!!"}
{"text":"Several reviews talked about poor service.  We didn't have an issue. I timed it. 23 minutes after ordering wings they arrived.  I got 10 hot wings bone in, or I should I say 9 wings.  The others at the table got the correct amount.  They were good, not the best but had good heat.  Waitress was great and friendly.  It was a little loud but what else would you expect???"}
{"text":"First time here and I must say I am really enjoying my food! I got a to go order and figured Id try a few different things. Pretzel bites are bomb, loaded fries are bomb and my boneless wings! Ill definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, one time Saturday (Yesterday) and another time on my last visit to my folks in Phoenix, both times, I was impressed with Booty's food quality, prices, and COLD BEER!   I have sat at the bar both times, and the blonde server/bartender is an Ace! She's one of the best I have seen, she manages everything like an expert, is friendly, efficient, outgoing, communicates, pretty much perfect.   Both times I ordered wings and the loaded fries, and both times great food, great flavor, GREAT HEAT, and most of ALL GREAT TASTE. Fresh made food and everything you need provided, bone plates, wipes, etc. I like a place you don't have to ask much, and this is that kind of place. The person serving you already knows how to make it top notch.   I had the Habanero Lime Dry Rubs this last time and they were excellent, with that building heat that Habaneros provide. My dad could only handle one. It was an excellent stop, and I will be back when I visit!"}
{"text":"Great wings, good fried food, but not too impressed with the rest.   I mean, I've come here several times. It's good, nothing spectacular. decent happy hour and draft prices, and known for their wings... which are pretty good. Their medium flavor has some solid taste. I would stay away from the tacos and sandwiches.   For football watching, they have a lot of TVs, and typically have the sound on, but quality of sound is rather scratchy. SPOILER ALERT = some of the TVs are poorly synced and you might see a TD ten seconds before someone on the other side of the bar, make sure you get the TV that ahead. lol   Service has been good in the times I have visited, I always sit at the bar, the tenders have always been friendly and I haven't had any issues. Now that I think about it, I don't think I have ever identified an actual manager... hmm.   I'll keep coming back because it is convenient, and the wings are so good. If anything changes I'll be sure to update my rating."}
{"text":"Best wings I have had! My daughter says she has had better wings once in New York but for Arizona, this is the best. Great place with all  the sports games on and good service. We started with the loaded fries. .They may be better than the wings! They have wing sauce, cheese, bacon and ranch on them and they are yummy. Wings we have now tried a few different kinds from their 50 or so sauces and rubs. My favorite so far is the parmesan. We get medium and it is perfect. Not to hot but a good kick. We have tried the blue cheese and the chipotle and they have all been really good.   They do have RC for their beverages which is interesting! Hadn't had RC in years! Wish there was one on my side of town but when we venture up to the Surprise area, this is the only place we will be eating!"}
{"text":"If you want an attentive waitress or good not great, good customer service, don't come here.  I don't know if it was because we were seated in the restaurant section and not in the bar area but the 2 times we ate here, customer service was non-existent.    The First time we ate here was lunch time during the week.  Only seemed like one waitress for the whole place but there was MAYBE one more table to wait on.  Took us a while for waitress to come back to us to order our food after she got our drinks.  Once we got out food and drinks, it took another while before the waitress came back to fill our drinks.   I am telling you the place was slow but this girl was by herself so I gave her benefit of the doubt.  2nd time we ate here, the place had a few more customers but again did not seem busy.  There were a girls up front  to greet us and we sat down and our waitress came and ordered our drinks.  It took her a while to come back and take our order.  I think she was too busy chit chatting with her co workers and/or on her phone.  Maybe both...  We try to get someone attention and another waitress takes our order.  We get our food ordered, eventually food comes out.  Time for refills and again waitress is lagging on checking on us.  Eventually we finish our food and again, the waiting game for the waitress to bring us our check.  We flag someone down again and we get our check.  We are new to the area and new to Booty's and we were excited to try this place out and eat here however after the 2 times we have gone there to eat, the customer service has been horrible for us.  We most likely will NOT be going back there again."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its name.  Burgers on point.  Wings are on point with a variety of sauces. Also you can get your fries dry rubbed with different flavors.  I would have given a 5 star if they had better craft brews to top it off. Otherwise everything is delicious and staff is very friendly. If your in Buckeye come check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"Casual, relaxed atmosphere. Live band on fridays! The grand Canyon burger was AMAZING their buns are made of french bread or something. Cheap beer-happy hr til 7 everyday. Wings are crispy and excellent. Jacob was our server- he was awesome!"}
{"text":"Exelent service went out Of their way for wonderful Customer service thanks for the drinks and wings!!!! AAA+++"}
{"text":"If you like spicy bar food, you may like this place more than we did.  I had some wings and was slightly nauseated until the next day."}
{"text":"Service, cleanliness, and overall feel of this place has gone terribly downhill over the last year. This used to be a decent place to go and I stopped by here often, but not anymore. This place has slid terribly and the lack of business shows that the locals all feel the same way. It will be sad to see this place eventually close when the locals wanted it to succeed more than the managers and owner."}
{"text":"Delicious creative burgers and wings. The wings here are HUGE and flavorful. I recommend the honey mustard flavoring. You will not be disappointed. However a slight peeve is that the buns on the burgers and sandwiches get soggy so you need to eat them quickly."}
{"text":"Excellent big crispy wings! Chipotle garlic, Caesar fire, and desert ranch were delicious. Loaded fries were pretty great too. The blue cheese burger was out of this world... Juicy burger with great flavor and excellent tasty grilled buttery bun. House made chips were marvelous. Service was ok but food was great!"}
{"text":"If I could,  I would give this place 10 stars. I've been yelping for 4 years and I haven't ever been to a restaurant that was this good. The place is a sports restaurant with several televisions inside and a full alcoholic bar. The restaurant was clean and the staff was excellent.   I had a long island ice tea (alcoholic beverage) was very strong. I had some bbq bacon burger (I don't remember the name) which was freaking amazing, as well as the onion rings. My friend had a chicken sandwich which was also amazing (see pics).  I went on a Sunday afternoon during football season, so the place was a little crowded but not too loud. For a place named \"Booty's\", I didn't think it would get a high review from me, but boy I was absolutely wrong. This place also gives 7% back via Yelp cash back.   Our waitress (I didn't get her name, but i wish I did) was outstanding and assisted with answering my questions regarding the menu. I will definitely recommend this place to people who are coming to Arizona (i reside in California) and I definitely come back, when I come back to visit friends.   Great place. Keep up the great / outstanding work."}
{"text":"Not bad food but other places in Surprise are better. The wings were overlooked but the nachos were decent. The service was ok."}
{"text":"The buffalo chipotle wings are the best!! Actually everything is....we haven't had anything we don't like. Our kids love it too!! We are frequent visitors. We even got a ton of wings for a party we were having and everyone was asking where we got them!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice, the atmosphere is fun and energetic. The food is ok my husband gets burgers and wings he says they're great. I've had the Asian salad and that was yummy but tonight I had the fish fry and it was greasy and really dark like the oil was old. The band however was wonderful! Also our waitress was very friendly and knew the menu very well. We will be back :)"}
{"text":"I was excited when this place openned.  But its taken a bad turn. Watching a game is great if your team is same as the owners or staff. Food is so-so. The staff is usually decent.  Condition of the furniture makes it look like its been there for 20 years.  Hope it gets better"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I walked into this place on a Sunday night, the place was pretty empty. The waitress and bartender saw us and no one came to take our drink order. We waited 15 mins and left. A regular named \"Chris\" came in and got service right away. He had his drink on the table before he even sat down. Place seemed very dated with furniture and seems very dirty."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time this past Sunday with my family. The hostess was on the phone so it took a bit for her to seat us. I did not mind waiting while she was on the phone but she could have acknowledged us or said hi. Anyway, we were seated and the waitress took our order. The place was not too busy and we were able to order fairly quickly. I ordered the veggie bomber with sweet potato fries. The food I ordered was great! My fiancé ordered the patty melt and wanted bacon added, which was forgotten. He said it was okay and next time we wants to try the wings. My son had the kids wings which he enjoyed. One of my daughters ordered the Mac and cheese which she really liked as well. For an appetizer we had the quest dip which had a bit of a spice to it and it was just okay. But overall we had a good experience."}
{"text":"As easy as chicken wings are to make, there are many places that still muck it up, this is not one of those places.  They have twelve dry rubs and at least twice as many sauces. If you can't find something you like, you really aren't trying. I order my wings extra crispy at most places; here they refer to it as a long cook (16 minutes) and they are happy to do it.  I had the Triple Threat dry rub and Crazy Hot sauce on the side and it was a flavor explosion. They will also add any of their dry rubs to the fries, and I also ordered the Triple Threat on those. Unless you are a spice maniac, I don't recommend that you get the fries and wings spicy...just trust me, it was warm.  The service if friendly and prompt. The owners are pleasant and outgoing.  The only reason I won't give this five stars is the air conditioning. This time of year, it is warm in our valley and the A/C at this place just can't keep up. It is just warm enough for you to notice, but not stifling or hot by any stretch. It is a building problem that the strip mall owner should address, but refuses to. That is a shame."}
{"text":"I liked the food but it is way too small and cramped for a Sports Bar and it took us almost an hour to get a couple burgers so .. it needs work but it wasn't terrible.  If you are claustrophobic stay away."}
{"text":"They have good food good service! My favorite is the bootys patatoe wedges, they are delicious also the wings crispy! Just how I like them. They have a big variety of flavors to choose from. Friendly staff. Give it a try! Been here more than twice and have not been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cool place to check out with fair pricing during happy hour. Had a friend that worked here, they make all of the wing sauces in-store which is really cool because they're flavors that only exist there.  Has a little stage for weekend bands which is cool."}
{"text":"Great place to meet new friends and the staff is awesome.  Overall, one of my favorite places to go and have a beer and best wings"}
{"text":"I love their burgers but not a huge fan of their wings. Too small and not a lot of flavor options. Tables are very close together so I was always running into our neighbors table when trying to get up to go to the bathroom. Harder to see the tvs from the front dining room since they're in the bar area but we will be back. Service is ok. Really young girls sometimes don't have the table side manner you want."}
{"text":"The best wings in town .. period! Meaty, crispy and amazing!  From sauces to rubs! BWW and Tailgaters have nothing on Bootys Wings! Try the sweet red chili sauce or the jamaican jerk rub. Or if you like it hot.. go with the ghost death or triple threat! A full bar with awesome bartenders, waitresses and great service :)"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time coming here! The service we received was embarrassing. Our server forgot multiple things that we asked for and had an attitude toward everyone at the table that was female. For a wing place they have mediocre wings, the only good thing about this place was the fried pickles. It's safe to say we will never return."}
{"text":"Wings are really really good. Really. Their medium sauce and buffalo parm medium are our familys favorite. The loaded buffalo gold fries are excellent. If you dont prefer heat, forgo the jalapenos on the loaded fries as they do put alot on them. They are great even without the jalapenos. One thing to try is a basket of fries with their Desert Ranch rub sprinkled on the fries,  soooooo good. If you are in the mood for wings, this place will hit the mark or spot or whatever filling you may have."}
{"text":"Holy heck. Here's a reason to drive out to Surprise! The wings here are incredible.  Incredibly hot should you choose to experiment. Order the Crazy Hot or Ghost Death and you just might die. Recover your taste buds with Buffalo Garlic Parmesan. Sweet potato fries with cinnamon honey sauce help to calm things down.  Dry rubs are a nice way to be less of a hot mess, but still can pack a punch. We thoroughly enjoyed Booty's Blast and Triple Threat (borderline sweet).  A fun, boisterous space with copious amounts of seating."}
{"text":"Dirty place burger was greasy and had no flavor.fries were great. Pretzels taste just like a grilled cheese sandwich"}
{"text":"We were out and about and decided to stop in for a beer and some wings. We were greeted promptly and sat right away. There were a fair amount of people in the restaurant for the time of day. There is a nice bar some high top tables and an area with short tables and booths for those with kids. We were happy to see Shock Top available and we were especially happy when we found out it was only $2.75! We shared an order of 20 wings which were quite large and meaty. We ordered garlic Parmesan buffalo sauce in medium, but next time we would definitely get hot as medium was not too spicy. They had several other sauces to choose from. We are definitely planning to return to try some of the other foods or appetizers. This would be a fun place to watch a game or hang out with a group of friends. The food was great, the beer was COLD, the service was quick and friendly and the prices were awesome!"}
{"text":"Food and service was great! Definitely coming back. Our server mckenzie was amazing and she always checked to make sure everything was good!"}
{"text":"Dont come here for Football!! At least on Saturdays. Came to watch the ASU game along with half the bar wearing football apparel. And they have loud music and cut the main screen off for karaoke. Really Karaoke??? Its football season!!!!! So annoyed. So we are scarfing our food down to take off to a bar that has the game with sound on. No more booty for us during football season!"}
{"text":"Attention yelpers that whine about their experience not being \"perfect\" this is a sports bar, not the capital grille or a steakhouse. When everyone is saying \"best wings\" we are talking about the traditional bone in wings, of course the boneless wings are like \"chicken nuggets\" or \"Tyson chicken\" with sauce drizzled on them... Because those aren't real wings! They probably offer them for weirdos who don't like eating real wings...  Anyway.... The traditional wings \"hot\" and \"crazy hot\" are amazing.... We only eat the wings here and I have been picking up orders and taking them to my family to eat for two years, we tried a burger too before and it was pretty damn good. So if you go here, remember... It's a bar! Order some traditional wings and a cold beer and you will do just fine. The end!"}
{"text":"We go here ALL the time. The servers are great-super friendly, super easy going, no pressure-just overall wonderful. They're doing it right. The food good. My favorite thing: chicken quesadilla with the black bean salsa.. oh.em.gee. SO good. And of course, the wings-they have great prices and tons of flavors. The beer is deeeelicous. It's always frosty cold-Sonoran White Chocolate AleL Whoa. Holla!   It also has a really good happy hour. The food and drinks are both discounted and it's from 11-7 every day I believe.   Overall, the place is pretty legit.  Easy welcoming atmosphere that caters to everyone:young, old, \"hip\", not so hip, everyone."}
{"text":"Can't complain about the food.  However, it was a slow afternoon and it took forever for our food to arrive.  In all fairness to our waiter he ended up being the only one who was friendly and helping everyone.  Our orginal waitress wouldn't have known a smile if it bit her in the behind.  She supposedly wasn't feeling well and left the only other waiter to handle everyone.  She seemed fine as she walked around and the restaurant looking busy while actually doing nothing.  The waiter was trying to be on top of things but was overwhelmed yet kept his friendly demeanor with everyone.  The hostess literally stood there and watched him but did nothing to help.  So much for teamwork.    Sports bar ish and great place to get wings in a casual environment"}
{"text":"Service was awesome! Wayne was awesome! Wings were outstanding! Ask for samples. Lots to choose from!"}
{"text":"OMG! This was my first trip, but certainly not my last. The service was good. The food was great. I would recommend this place to any wing lover. The wings are big and meaty. You would not be disappointed! You have to try the loaded buffalo gold fries. Heaven on a plate!"}
{"text":"It sucked. Never again. My wife and I ate there for the first time and that was our first and last mistake. Burgers were over cooked, try and burnt. The fries were cold and to get sweet potato fries instead of regular fries you had to pay an additional $4.00. Just not worth the money. The service also sucked."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family and my friend and her family. My family has never been here before. So it's a sports bar type of place, with a BUNCH of different flavors for wings! What I found to be really cool was that since they have so many flavors of wings you can actually ask to sample the flavors! I opted for a peanut Thai and Asian something I honestly can not remember but they both were tasty! I also ordered the Grand Canyon burger and honestly as much as I'd like to review it I never even tasted it, so I'll have to add to this review later after I eat it. Our waiter was a very nice young man who took care of an 8 person party and he really took good care of us. My only complaint is that I had ordered a burger as well and it didn't come out till about 20 mins after the rest of the food, I even asked the waiter to forget about it but he said it was already being made. But all in all I would still go back."}
{"text":"Booty's somehow remains a hidden gem. They have some of the nation's best sauces and rubs with awards to prove it. You can cover any menu item with any sauce or seasoning, or just try it on the side!   What's amazing?   Their burgers are very big and cooked to perfection every time (even medium-rare). The Bacon Blu burger is hard to beat.   Their very-generous helpings of skin-on fries (update: they changed their fries) absolutely the best around (update: still good, but not the best), especially when you cover them in your choice of dry rub (try Jamaican Jerk or Chile Lime Blast).  Their mac and cheese used to be the most underrated item on the menu and impossibly good. Well, they changed the method of cooking, preparation, and the ingredients about a year ago; it's not as good, but still worth a shot."}
{"text":"Great lunch today they have happy hour that starts early. I took a friend we had begets and fries. Good service very clean and fast. We're in and out in less the thirty min. Take the time and try this"}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich with Chile's was delish but the service and wait for food was ridiculous. We waited 35 min.  So for service and wait I would give it a 1 For food 4"}
