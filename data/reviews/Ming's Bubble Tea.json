{"text":"This place is the best, come here weekly. The atmosphere is awesome and the workers are extremely nice! I recommend this to all my friends. They also have board games to play. I recommend the fruit garden tea with mango poping bobas. You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time, it was a lovely experience! The store is nice and spacious, the staff is always very friendly AND informative! Whenever I didn't know what something was, I would get an explanation of what it was and also the best combinations (if you get the pearls).

Personally? My favorite is the Jasmine Green Tea with Lychee fruit pieces. It was on the lighter side, so I felt very refreshed and healthy haha! The Strawberry tea with Strawberry Boba was also sweet and delicious. Then again, the Honeydew with Lychee was really awesome as well...I'm stuck!

Well-made teas, and a very nice and friendly atmosphere. Please check this place out!"}
{"text":"The best bubble tea place in Northeast Ohio!!! Amazing tastes and variety of teas!! There are many sitting areas and a large ceiling that warmly invites you inside. I recommend this place to all tea and bubble tea lovers."}
{"text":"We always come here and get the milk bubble teas. The honeydew milk tea, 3Q, and black milk bubble tea have always been our favorites but we've been too scared to try the fruit teas. Today they gave us a mango passionfruit popping boba tea for us to try out and it was sooo good! Great customer service and tea. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"It's in a nice location that is easy to walk to but it's kind of cold inside. And I really wish they'd work on their decor. They tea is also very sweet. It is almost too sweet. Tea is supposed to be healthy and this just does not do the job. The staff is nice though."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and excellent bubble tea!!! Such a cute place with so many choices. Highly recommend the milk teas and fruit teas! So good I'm addicted!"}
{"text":"Just went with some friends earlier today, one of my friends ACCIDENTALLY grabbed the wrong drink, but instead of kindly being asked to help correct the mistake, the manager called her out in front of the entire place and humiliated her, asking how she could possibly grab the wrong drink in a very dramatic fashion. Even though she apologized to the manager and the other customer multiple times, the manager continued to be rude. Keep in mind, my friend had never been here before and did not know what her drink was going to look like. The situation was handled completely immaturely and aggressively. Dont go here."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite bubble tea joint! The staff is so sweet and helpful. The decor is adorable and the wishing Wall is very cool. The tea is DELICIOUS. I recommend the Honeydew milk tea - it's very tasty. Definitely will be back here, probably every week!"}
{"text":"I tried the bubble tea here for the first time after having visited another bubble tea purveyor in Kent. The bubble tea wasn't that great--the boba had no taste and was too chewy--and the atmosphere was lacking. They tried to make it cozy but it's just a huge room of tables and chairs. When I went, it was filled with undergrads. I can see how undergrads would be drawn to this place, with ample room for studying and bubble tea that only comes in a large size, but I prefer quality bubble tea, and I will be going elsewhere for that."}
{"text":"I drive here just to get there bubble tea even though it a bit far from where I live. It definitely worth it. I got to say that this place become my favorite spot because it really  nice and clean, also the owner and staff are very friendly xD"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!!  Live the bubble tea with snow!!  The staff is friendly and the decor is unlike any other in Kent"}
{"text":"Easily my favorite bubble tea place. The tea is amazing and the people who work there are extremely nice and welcoming. Highly recommend it to any bubble tea lovers!!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a experience trying bubble tea for the 1st time. We got the passion fruit and mango fruit tea with strawberry and mango bubble boba awesome. Now we are trying a milk based drink can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"My friend accidentally took the wrong drink and the manager yelled at her in front of the entire store. He was very rude and refused to be nice about the situation even though she apologized profusely to him and the customer who's very similar drink she accidentally took. I have had good experiences here previously. However, because of this situation, they will not be receiving my service again."}
{"text":"The Ming Dynasty lives on! Ming's Bubble Tea has a cool guy working here, but he often can't handle the volume of people coming in for his excellent drinks. I've only tried them once. The second time, I dragged Amber, Matt, and my girl in here and after waiting 10 mins, he apologized and told us it'd be 10 more before he could whip up drinks for us. There were only about 5 people waiting in front of us, but when one guy is making all those fancy drinks it can really hold things up.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to trying this for a second time, but it was a bit of a detour and a big waste of time, so try Ha! Tea north of the center of Kent, and I'll review this again if I actually get served only 3rd trip."}
{"text":"I was beyond excited when this place opened and I was not disappointed! I love this place! I always get the mango passion fruit tea with pearls, but I have tried almost every tea they have. The staff is absolutely amazing; they are super friendly and kind. It's such a happy place! They bring the ingredients from Taiwan! Everything is authentic - no shortcuts! That's why every single tea tastes great. When I go with my friends, we play games and write notes for the wish wall which has become huge! Some people bring their food with them, do work, and enjoy their tea. Must try!!!"}
{"text":"This is a super cute boba place with good tea and solid boba. The interior is super cute with some board games, wall decorations, a wishing wall, and a memory notebook. The service was super nice when it came to recommendations and modifications. I ended up getting a coffee milk tea which was quite strong in terms of the coffee flavor, but not too bad! My brother got the hot ginger tea which helped him brave the cold. He did note that the tea was packed with ginger which made it somewhat spicy. Seems like a good place to hang out and study or just chill with friends."}
{"text":"I drive 45 minutes from Cleveland to enjoy this delicious tea! Locally owned, fresh products, amazing tea! I wish this business much success. Environment is extremely clean, I really enjoy the milk tea, especially the matcha. The fruit garden POG tea is also quite delicious. I will continue to make the commute. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I love going to Ming's to relax before work. Great business with major potential to expand themselves."}
{"text":"So I had no idea what bubble tea was. My wife brought me and my son and it was a fun experience! 
It was kind of a tea -  mixed/shaken with fruit or milk, to which chewy tapioca balls and fruit jelly is added. It has those little fruity pop things you put on your frozen yogurt. You can get it cold or hot. We got it cold. 
The place is clean and the owner is cool. They seem to have a local following and regulars, especially with the college crowd. However, even if you are new to bubble tea, the owner is nice enough to walk you through the ordering process. Check it out if you like tea."}
{"text":"Ming's is a hidden gem in Kent, OH! I'm not kidding when I say I come here atleast once a week for bubble tea :) The environment is positive and welcoming. I love that it's encouraged for guests to write on their inspiration wall or play a board game with their friends. They deliver great customer service and even greater drinks! 

They just recently celebrated 2 years being in Kent, and I can't wait to see them flourish for years to come!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! Please get the Peach Snow Bubble Tea with mango boba!! It's so good!! Everything here is good as well as the cute decor Inside"}
{"text":"My friend ordered a drink and accidentally picked up the wrong one. The barista yelled at her in front of the whole restaurant. Rude and disrespectful. We had high hopes. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Tea is freshly made and taste fantastic! The owner is super friendly and is an army veteran.  Def recommend!"}
{"text":"I love love loveeeee bubble tea! But I am not so fond of how they make theirs.  I understand that they want to stand out and be unique but I honestly don't like some of their mixtures of some of their bubble tea flavors mixed with green tea.  In my opinion a taro bubble tea should be left alone! Green tea and taro mixed together give off this interesting after taste and you can't really taste the sweetness of the taro.  Seeing all these reviews this place has is impressive!  I understand there are a lot of people who may like how unique their flavors are, but for my particular taste buds, if I want something sweet and sugary, I rather have just that."}
{"text":"I'm glad I finally got to try this cute hidden shop and meet the incredibly friendly Ming. Ming has a wonderful enthusiastic energy that is inspiring and refreshing. And the gentleman who is always assisting her always greets you with a wonderful smile and quiet yet elegant aura. 
 Along with their combined characteristics, you will also enjoy their fresh teas and clean environment. The spot might seem small from the outside but is rather large (good for groups) indoors. With a game shelf for all to enjoy and quiet atmosphere you can't go wrong with a visit to this tea shop. Although they do not currently offer as many flavors, boba,etc  as other bubble tea houses, they do have a jasmine milk tea that I have yet to see anywhere else.  
 Even if you don't like tea, just try one of their fruity flavors with popping pearls & you wont be disappointed (or even taste the tea). The adorable animal themed lids they put on top couldn't be any cuter! This is also a great place for local students to study as there is plenty of space to spread out your work and focus."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places ever. The workers are so kind and give very good suggestions if you are new at ordering bubble tea. My favorite is the blueberry tea with strawberry popping boba. The inside is adorable and the sticky note wall of your dreams/goals/random thoughts is so unique and inspiring. Totally recommend checking this place out for fast service and delicious tea."}
{"text":"Came here once and had an not the best experience; today, I decided to give them another chance and it turns out that it was worse than expected. The manager Ming was rude to my friend and I when we simply asked what the ingredients in the non dairy creamer he used, his answer was he did not know. Next, we decided to ask the brand of non-dairy creamer he used instead and he refused to tell and stated he did not know and acted as if it was none of our business and it was a health concern over a certain ingredient-sodium caseinate- in the non-dairy creamer that a lot of bubble tea non-dairy creamers have that could cause health issues with some people. Moreover, when my friend wanted to order bubble tea they claimed both to me and her that they were out of black tapioca pearls, yet when I came back to refund my first tea over a concern, I saw the black pearls sitting outside on the counter. My friend did not order just because they claimed to be out of the black tapioca pearls that most people probably get in their drinks. When my friend spoke up to the manager about how disrespectful he was to us when we asked just simple questions that he should know and it is our right to ask and know, the manager just blew my friend off, along with me when I tried to tell him how it is important to realize that the non dairy creamer is not safe for everyone since it could cause someone to go to the ER room and he stated for those people who have a concern with it regardless to avoid his restaurant. Sorry Ming, but you have lost a loyal customer and an almost loyal one."}
