{"text":"Best restaurant for modern authentic Italian food. The servers were extremely attentive to our needs, we ate the Sicilian Roasted Cauliflower, Grilled Calamari and Fonduta which was all cooked perfectly. As a big foodie and having been to many restaurants worldwide I was very impressed by the much anticipated opening as Frankie and Anthony were both very successful with the Frankie Fettuccine food truck. Highly reccommend this restaurant as you will not leave disappointed. I will definitely be going back and its great to see a new spark to the Port Credit restaurant scene."}
{"text":"We had some plans in the area and decided to give this place a try on a Friday night. The restaurant was quiet when we arrived at 6pm, however, it became a bit more busy at around 7ish. The service was good as our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable.   We were given complimentary slices of baguettes (from Ace bakery) with olive oil and balsamic vinegar prior to our appetizers and mains. The bread was a bit tough and lacked the nice fresh crust, we could tell it was a day old. We ordered the following dishes:  Beets and Burrata ($19) - This salad was quite delicious, and was one of my favourite dishes. The burrata was creamy and had a nice milky flavour, which was complimented with sweet sliced beets and plum tomatoes, fresh peppery arugula and a thick tangy balsamic dressing. All the flavours and textures worked well.  Grilled Calamari ($15) - We really enjoyed the tomatoe sauce in this dish as the capers and black olives added a very nice flavour. The calamari itself was not bad, but it was cooked a tad too long, although still relatively tender.   Risotto with Cod ($28) - This was one of the featured specials for the night. The saucy risotto was plump and al dente, and the flavour was spot on, however, the cod was a let down as it was very dry, almost to the point where it was difficult to swallow.  Fusilli with Chicken ($25) - The fusilli came in the classic aglio e oglio sauce, but rather than infusing the oil with only garlic, there was also a refreshing spinach taste to it. The pasta was cooked al dente and it was absolutely heavenly with the oil and roasted tomatoes. Sadly, similar to the cod, we found the chicken breast to be extremely dry.  Our friends ordered the carbonara and the seafood linguine. The seafood linguine was unexpectedly spicy as there was no sign of heat in the menu description.   We also ordered 2 glasses of white wine to compliment our meals ($11-12 / glass).  Overall, we thought the pastas, risotto and sauces were cooked to perfection. However, there is quite a bit of room for improvement when it comes to the cooking methods for their protein."}

I would 100% recommend this place for first dates or any other intimate social outing as it's romantic ambiance allows for conversation in an upscale setting."}
{"text":"Delicious food and horrible service..... unfortunate experience for a large group.  Having dined here one other time, we thought we would bring some friends to try it again for a special occasion.  It was very apparent that customer service is not their strong suit - no apologies when it took almost 2 hours from when we sat down, had orders taken to receiving our meals.   Everything had to be requested as there was zero foresight with anticipating a customers needs, ie. glass of water, spoon for spaghetti, additional beverages, coffee/tea, dessert.... the list goes on.   Disappointing!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant in port credit serving authentic Italian cuisine. It was really busy on the Friday night that we went but it did not compromise the service. Wait staff was very friendly and the chefs even came out to greet us and see how we were doing. Everyone was so incredibly personable. The food was delicious. I had the lobster ravioli which totally hit the spot. The lobster brodo was very flavourful, seasoned just to my liking and the ravioli with mascarpone filling just about melted in my mouth. Prices were very reasonable for what you get and serving sizes were generous. The ambience in the restaurant was great. Good for date nights and for big parties. It happened to be very busy when we went and so it was a bit on the louder side, but not unlike any other busy downtown restaurant. Happy to have this great little addition to port credit."}
