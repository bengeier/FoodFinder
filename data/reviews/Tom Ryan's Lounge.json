{"text":"It's an older crowd for sure, but is fun for any age if you go with a group.  Almost all country music, but the regular crowd on the dance floor is pretty entertaining.  

A lot of  \"cougars\" and plenty of opportunity for debauchery if you are a guy in your 20s... if that's the direction you are looking to go.  Drinks are cheap, so that should help you make some bad decisions.

There seem to be a lot of fights at this bar.  Then again, that can be fun to watch too."}
{"text":"please beware that they will override your song selection on the jukebox which is ludicrous. grow up. what is the point of a jukebox if you cant hear what you paid for. Bartender told me he overrode my song bc \"no one wants to hear that $hi7\" mind you there were 5 ppl in the bar. Thank goodness I don't live here."}
{"text":"Love this place. Bartenders are fantastic. Cheap drink prices as well. Great atmosphere for a country bar. Great place to sit and relax"}
{"text":"I\"m giving this place 3 stars becasue my party should've been thrown out and the cops should've been called but no one seemed to care that there was a wrestling match going on in front of the bar. The shots were pricey and so were the beers, but I will say that the shots were NOT watered down.  If you are planning a night out where debauchery is bound to be found then is one of the places to head...."}
{"text":"Cold beer.

Cheap Ice cold domestic beer in a friendly neighborhood dance hall located in a dying strip mall.  I found this place strip mall crawling.  It is pretty much invisible from the road so you have to be really looking for it.

The bartender was very friendly.  Service was good.  

I came back the next day to watch a football game and had a good time.  The place is big and roomy with good service and cheap cold beer.  The bartenders and regulars are real friendly.  Seems everyone knows each other at this place."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a couple drinks on a night where crowds aren't your thing.  

Bit of an older crowd most nights, but everyone has always been friendly. Very nice staff always helpful.  

Be warned, on weekends when you open a tab, it's a place that puts a 20 dollar hold on your card until it clears with the bank, and I didn't know that beforehand, so when my card ran twice, well, the next day I wasn't too happy. 

But the servers made up for it with some drink chips and everything was ok after a few days.

Good jukebox selection"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest country dive bars ever!!!  Ok, that seems like an oxymoron but it really is a fun place to hang out.  

A total locals bar and they even serve jello shots!  My friend and I headed there after a very delicious dinner at Kona Grill (at the recommendation of their sushi chef) and loved it as soon as we walked in.  The place had all the requisites of a dive bar:  neon lights, beer labeled bar tables, cheap drinks and jello shots.  It was a great place to watch the locals do their thing.  Lots of cowboy hats and big buckles.  The band started up and boy did these locals tear up the dancefloor!  There were some amazing dancers twirling around in their cowboy boots.  I'd never seen a guy twirl three girls at one time before!

Of course we had to try our shot at the dancefloor and I failed miserably but had a total blast doing it.  Note to self, \"Don't talk when dancing, you lose count and either trip or step on someone's foot.\"  I'm sure I looked like a dork but I didn't care and honestly I don't think anyone else did either.

There was a very funky mixed crowd from girls in their early 20's to guys in their late 60's.  The best thing about this place was everyone was super friendly and were having a terrific time.  All their beers on tap are domestic except for Heineken.

I went back a few days later with my coworker, it was ladies night with $1 drinks!  Who doesn't love that?  I ordered a glass of wine and was expecting it to be served in a plastic cup but they actually gave me a wine glass!  :D  I did get lots of looks though which was pretty funny.

Best thing about this place, no smoking inside the bar."}
{"text":"It's been a while since we stopped into Tom Ryan saloon. Cruising on Friday night we decided to make a stop since we found out that Tom's was open again after a brief closure. Upon arriving we noticed the parking lot was void of many of the motorcycles that I have been there previously. Upon entering we also noticed that inside had been cleaned up somewhat and the clientele had seem to be a little more mature than doing earlier visits. The band playing was the breakaways and were typical country band music was very good. The staff and the wait was minimal as we sat at the bar.
The only fault that I found with Tom Ryan's is the lack of the kitchen and the only food are light snacks. 
However, if you're looking for a place with good country music, good size dance floor and a fun crowd, Tom Ryan's is a good place to be. It has a long history in our area and it is one of the better country western bars in the southeast Valley of Phoenix. 
I believe in my personal opinion that if Tom Ryan's  had a small kitchen served at least  some bar food they would have a four star rating.
This bar is made for drinking and dancing."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. People,  music, dancing  and fun.  Highly recommended for a good night out.  From beginner dancing to advanced, enjoy. I have been going here for years.

{"text":"I liked it better when it was \"Group Therapy\". They used to have rock and blues bands there and it was a calmer and gentler crowd. The hillbilly music they play now is so depressing, no wonder those guys drink and fight the way the way they do. I went there once and before I could finish my beer I heard glass break three times and saw two fights. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this Bar, love it. I don't know why I don't come here more often. Maybe because I'm in my 40's covered in tattoo's with a mohawk looking for a rock bar in this valley STILL to this day.  I totally don't look like I belong here, but this is just a FUN bar. Bar staff is great, the music is awesome. I grew up on all this old country, reminds me of my childhood. The band sprinkles just a bit of new country, but I know most of these songs. Something about a few shots and beers makes me take my girl on the dance floor and try to fit in here. OH, another great thing about this place, DRINKS ARE CHEAP!!!  I got 2 shots and a beer, handed her a 20 and got change back........this blew my mind!! 
I'm going to stop looking for that RnR bar that I want to hang out in, and start hanging out here more often."}
{"text":"We saw a man drop his motorcycle on a parked car next to him in (literally) the first parking spot out front facing the bar. He was drunk beyond all belief and his friends just picked him up, dusted him off, and watched him speed away. He left two obvious dents in the car and didn't say a word. I called the next day to tell the bar and the manager seemed less than interested. If you're reading this and it was your car- let me know, I have pictures! As for the bar itself, service is slow and waitresses seem uninterested. Bathrooms are dirty prices are high for a dive bar. You're better off going to Jolie's or The Reef 2!"}
{"text":"Fun local bar that features live country western bands and dancing. Lots of locals on the dance floor which makes it fun even for the non dancer. 

Pool tables and inexpensive drinks make this a fun night out!"}
{"text":"I like this bar. I really enjoyed the band Zona Road..good prices and the service was good. The ladies room is ok. Very old, needs remodeled.."}
{"text":"Reminded last night why we gave up on this place! I have been here after 4 hours at Jolie's, where I have eaten and my bar tab has literally been more for 4 drinks than my entire tab at Jolie's.  This has happened twice and both times had been during the week."}
{"text":"Good bartender, fan friggin tastic bloody mary's.  1st time drinking at 8am since I worked graveyard shifts and pleased."}
{"text":"I used to live by this dive. It was a great place around the corner if you wanted to hear good live country music. I grew up in the south so there was always a bar like Tom Ryan's around,  but here in the valley its not that easy to find a quality dive with good country music playing and some excellent dancers that are regulars to the bar."}
{"text":"I loved it here it's small quiet great music! The bathroom was clean! Kim the bartender is awesome! The people are cool great place to get away"}
{"text":"No cover, live band... need I say more?

Yes, it's country music but I'm a little bit country.  What's great about this place is the dancing.  I two step, waltz, west coast and east coast swing and so do the cowboys that frequent this place.  My friends and I barely had a chance to sip our drinks, we were always on the dance floor.  I've only been here twice and we danced our asses off both times.  

Also, they have an enclosed smoking patio with a bar.  There seems to be an entirely different crowd out there but still a lot of fun.  The drinks are meh, I had a rum & coke that tasted like cough syrup so I just stuck to beer and shots.  Cocktail waitresses were very attentive."}
{"text":"Great country hole  in wall decent drink specials and live music older demographic so pretty laid back and a good time if over 50 besides that there immediate competition is Jolie's place which is never with out customers"}
{"text":"Omg I can't even explain how fun this place is! 

I am absolutely NOT a country girl by any stretch of the imagination but I am having the BEST time! Kim and Jack (adorable blond) at the bar were super helpful and totally made the entire experience amazing!!! 

Kyle was the best! He made everyone feel comfortable! It doesn't look like much but check it out! You'll be surprised!"}
{"text":"This place is probably what most would call a dive bar. It is a small spot in a rather hidden location but once you find it, it's pretty fun! It's a super casual country bar with inside and outside areas to drink, dance and enjoy. The prices of drinks are much cheaper then other bars and the service is fast and kind. There appear to be several locals here. The live band on the weekends are great! They have an awesome set and the crowd loves them. When I was here there was a bachelorette party happening which took up a lot of space here and made me feel like I was crashing their party. However, once they left, it was calmer and more relaxed. If you like live country music and cheap drinks this little local place may be a good spot for you!"}
{"text":"I live less than a mile from here and took over a year to get here.  Never realized what a hidden gem it was.  if you like country dive bars this is for you.  Food is not great, but it's good.  It's the atmosphere that makes this place a winner."}
{"text":"Jake is the best t bartender in the Phoenix metro area great service drinks and music"}
{"text":"What a tragedy. Mike and sue, only owners for about a year, ran this diamond in the rough into the ground. They alienated most of the regulars and treated the long time employees like trash. They destroyed and then walked away from the best country lounge in the valley. Their arrogant california attitude ruined this home to so many people. They scattered the best country talent and customers away. We heard they high tailed it back to CA. Good riddance. Hopefully some real home grown Arizonan's with respect and pride and true business sense will patch this broken home back together"}
{"text":"You'll find every age group hanging out here, it's a nice mixture of people. There's live music with an area for dancing. There's a moderate amount of seating. There is also a bar outside with additional seating. They have about 5 dart stations and 2 pool tables. The service is great, the two girls that helped us out last Saturday were very friendly and attentive. Drink prices are pretty reasonable.  It's not in the best location (a plaza) but parking is easy to find."}
{"text":"I have known about this place for many years and would stop in every now and then but then I started to go to Jolie's more and thought would give it a try and it has won me over this summer and now hardly go to Jolie's...

Honesty I have only have a few knocks on this place and one is not having food besides pizza, popcorn and peanuts, but now with uber eats and the ATL around the corner  for those that want wings, no problem.  We cheat sometimes and go eat at Jolie's but don't stay there much longer after.  I am a short guy can I get a step stool for the men's bathroom lol

So many games here, cornhole, touch screen, pool... And they have leagues or open tournaments on the weekends and during the week.  I am good at darts but the people that come in to play are so nice and teach even new tricks.  They have some pool sharks here which are everywhere lol but pool is free on Monday's and that is great.   

Great jukebox can download ap to your phone and good bands on weekend.  

As mentioned before great mix of age group esp on FRI/SAT nights lol...The regulars are a good group too from AZ natives, and from coast to coast.  Have not had a problem starting up a conversation here...  There are some \"clicks\" but so far everyone there has been great... 

Great happy hour deals, great selection of drinks, but what sells the place for me and my group (wolfpack) is the staff....  Katie, Paige, Summer, Crystal are amazing.  They are not just working for tips they are genuine and that is rare these days.  And even the boys Kyle and Amir treat everyone great and keep the house in order.   Not want to leave any names out but the staff does kick a$$.... 

If you want fun time, be treated like you would treat someone, this is a bar for you"}
{"text":"So good to see Tom Ryan's open again & apparently this is still a big secret! Wait staff was very friendly, the band so-so, but having country dancing back in Chandler is such a treat that we won't be passing it up. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great times in this bar.  Awesome prices.  Friendly service and awesome security on the weekends.  All in all a great place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I wish I could  give this place ZERO stars! My boyfriend and I were out having drinks with another couple and Tom Ryan's was our last stop of the night- we enjoyed a drink at the bar and enjoyed the live band- when I got up to use the restroom a woman was standing blocking the door- i asked if she worked there and she said yes and explained that the restroom was being cleaned. As I was waiting I could feel that last cocktail coming right back up but made it to the ladies room in time for my girlfriend to hold my hair back! As I was leaving the restroom my girlfriend and I were asked to leave by the same women who had blocking the door before-  I knew I had enough to drink and had no arguments.. The rest of my group was outside the restroom waiting for me so we could head out.. But as soon as we exited the lounge we were confronted by security and another patron who pushed my boyfriend down to the ground as we were walking away, he now has a horribly swollen elbow! The police were called and 3 out of the 4 of us were given warnings for TRESPASSING and were asked to never come back (not that we want to)I feel the staff was rude and man handled my group as we were walking out. I work in this industry and we have a responsibility to keep our patrons safe!"}
{"text":"I miss the days of a local Country bar that offered country music, fun loving rowdy crowd, and great live music! these days they are all so trendy and they are more like clubs. This place is a gem in a city full of wannabes! Its a bit of a drive but Tom Ryans is definitely worth it. When I walked in there was Jake Owen \"tell me\" playing on the jukebox and it was darker lit room with neon lights shining, pool tables bangin on the side, and high-tops wrapped around a nice sized dance floor... Ahhhh it felt like home! I had a couple beers and just chilled. The bartenders were so friendly and nice, however I did see their tough side come out when 1 customer got stupid, I was surprised as a big guy I wasn't asked to help. Around 9pm the band started playing and it wasn't the same ol country music (friends in low places), it was new mixed with old and it was good! I had to take a couple spins on the dance floor and if I was stationary my boot was tapping along the whole time. Around 10pm it started getting pretty busy. All the customers were so much fun and nice and just fun loving rowdy people. I was sad to have to leave early, but my buddy had to meet friends at another place. If your looking for a fun, good country music and a rowdy time this is the place for you. I will definitely be back."}
