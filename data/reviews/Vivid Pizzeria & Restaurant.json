{"text":"Dined there last night and really enjoyed the food and service. Our server was super friendly and attentive. 
We first ordered the caesar salad and salami and olive plate as appetizers. The salad was huge and we were very pleased with the amount of dressing, croutons and bacon. The salami plate was also very tasty and was a generous portion.
Then we ordered 2 different pizzas. I ordered one with bacon, pineapple and ham. It was very good and I liked the thin and soft quality of the crust. The topping amount was aqequate but I would have liked a bit more toppings. My husband ordered his pizza with goat cheese, prosciutto, sundried tomatoes, artichoke and hot sopresata. It was delicious but again I think the topping portion could have been slighty increased. However, that being said, I would definitely go back since the quality and taste were both excellent!
The price was also extremely reasonable. For one pint, a diet coke, 2 appetizers, one 12 inch and one 16 inch pizza the bill was 48.00 including tax!
I highly recommend you visit this establishment!"}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA! Beats Queen Margarita in Leslieville hands down. This place should be mobbed! The pizza is just as they serve it in Rome. We ordered the regina margerita and the parmgiana pizzas. Both were unbelievably delicious, and we're totally food snobs. We also had the arugula salad, which was really tasty and served with a heaping side of really nice quality parm. We will definitely be back. Wanted to spread the word about this adorable pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Very surprising little place.  I had a coupon and was expecting a hole in the wall, but was delighted with the pumpkin-coloured walls and nice wood tables (someone here mentioned plastic tablecloths, but they apparently are gone).  The TV was set to the fireplace channel, and the taped music enhanced the atmosphere.  We started with the Calamari Fritti, and received a plate of crisp, not-too-greasy and not at all chewy squid with a nice spicy dipping sauce.  One son had Pollo alla Griglia (chicken breast) with vegetables (he doused it in Parmesan so I can't vouch for its flavour, but he said it was good) and the other had the Fettuccini con Funghi.  It was a really decent-sized portion for all of $10, with a large amount of tender mushrooms.  The only thing missing was adequate salting.  I can say the same for my Fettuccine Vivides, which contained grilled chicken, goat cheese, and spinach in a basil pesto.  Maybe the pesto in Italy is different; this didn't have the usual green colour, nor the strong basil flavour.  But it was really lovely nonetheless.  The goat cheese was served as a tubular log, which was nice for me as I don't love goat cheese and could control how much I wanted to blend into the pasta.  Husband had one of the best pizzas I've ever had, with sopressata, green peppers and onions (he created his own concoction).  The crust was not too thin, not too thick, and had a great taste and slight chewiness.  The sopressata really made the pizza, adding a nice saltiness.  The cheese was absolutely perfect, and I would return again and again just for the pizza.  The service was lovely and attentive,  and we had a wonderful time at Vivid Pizzeria.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Vivid is a solid three star experience.  

We went last night (yes, we got the groupon, too) and had a perfectly nice time.  Food was good, ingredients were fresh and service was pretty fast.  But there are somethings that keep Vivid out of the 4 star bracket:

1. The service is a little odd.  We ordered two appetizers and two pizzas and they came out in a strange order.  Very quickly, we got both appetizers and one of the pizzas all together.  So it was hard to enjoy the apps because we didn't want the pizza to get cold.  The second pizza came out after we had finished most of the first one.  Good thing we love to share.

2. There are TVs everywhere and also fairly loud italian soft rock playing which detracted from an otherwise sweet and simple decor (red and white checkered tablecloths, etc.)

3. While not pricey, everything felt like one or two dollars more expensive than the dishes merited.  For example, our green salad had lettuce, cherry tomatoes and purple onion.  For $9.  Just a wee bit more than that should cost.

4. This may sound weird, but there are heavy plastic coverings on the tables that make the dishes stick to the table.  I kinda felt like I was in preschool again.  It was hard to move dishes around to accommodate the large plates on our small table.

All that said, their thin crust pizza is yummy and fresh.  Sauce is tasty and cheese is high quality.  Don't go for elegance, but it's a good spot if you live in the area and are craving something better than a chain slice.

Vegetarian score: 6.5/10.  Most of the pizzas have meat on them so just ask for your own combo if you want your pie meat free"}
{"text":"Excellent service- nice ambience and good quality food is what decribes this little treasure on St. Clair. We used a groupon deal for this place. We ordered 2 appetizers: the Caprese ($7-8) and Bruschetta $8. The Caprese was delicious. Huge chunks of fresh mozarella and tomato was simply refreshing to eat :) The bruschetta was nice too. The pizzas we ordered were also great- good quality fresh ingredients. One thing I didn't like was the dessert. I ordered a Tiramisu $5 (thinking I would get a close to authentic Italian fare)  but it was store bought. I dont think it should be on the menu really.  Overall, I'd say good quality and fresh- worth my money :))"}
{"text":"Had read in a recent review that this place was better than Queen Margarita, so my expectations were high when my husband and I brought my parents and our kids here for dinner.

Ordered Antipasto platter, Caprese salad, 5 pizzas, dessert tart & gelato. The food was yummy, but could have been better. Some disappointments: caprese salad had no fresh basil... dried basil was sprinkled on top (almost compensated by big thick slices of mozz), margarita pizza had a minuscule amount of basil on it, the dessert tart tasted stale to me (my mom insisted it was fine) and the 'vanilla bean' gelato tasted like a cheaper vanilla ice cream. I dunno, perhaps someone forgot to do the shopping?

Must say, the service was amazing - we had two kids with us, and the servers/babysitters were super with them! 

All in all, it was a positive experience. Based on previous raves, may have just caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend bought some kind of Groupon deal for Vivid Pizzeria back in December and we used it a couple nights ago. The restaurant possess a friendly family-run restaurant atmosphere that is also very sheik--well put together ambiance (clean, nice furniture & decorations, etc.), some unobtrusive flat screen TVs, etc. 

Between the two of us, we had an appetizer (Da Giovanni), two pizzas (Brighella & La Trentina) and dessert (Mixed Berry Cake). We were both thoroughly impressed by the quality of ingredients used in the food and the ingeniously artful combination of these ingredients at every step of the meal.

On a final note, the service there was amazing & fast. The server was super sweet and helpful with suggesting things to try from the menu. She also did a great job at not interrupting us at dinner. 

Not only would I highly recommend this restaurant to a friend, I would like to visit it again."}
