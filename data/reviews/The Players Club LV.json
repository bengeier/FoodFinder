{"text":"I can't say enough great things about The Players Club.  After recently moving here I've been looking for a \"Cheers\" bar where everyone knows my name...the food, the fresh drinks, Brian the bartender, the Wednesday music and all you can drink wine all make my heart go pitter patter.  It's a compilation of it all that makes me frequent The Players Club at least once per week if not more."}
{"text":"Great games, great staff, great food (really, really great food)!  What is there not to like?  Local to Henderson?  It is in your neighborhood and inexpensive.  Lots of unique beers, if you are not sure about the beers ask the waitresses, they are always happy to break them down for you and make recommendations.  The bartenders are attentive and excellent as well. 

I love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, close to home, great food and drinks & Witney DJs like a Boss! Always a good time."}
{"text":"Whit, Mike and Lucia are the best hands down.  They have rare bottles you can't  find at a regular gaming bar. This  has definitely become one of my favorite spots"}
{"text":"$8.50 for a beer screams \"Please don't come back\". Oh and figured out why the onion rings were 1/2 price. They were BURNT! Don't waste your time at this place..."}
{"text":"As we went fleeing from Hi-Scores, we ran into one of my co-workers, who had finally gotten there after mass traffic on the 215. Well, we didn't want her to feel bad, and I wanted to hang out with her some, so we tried the next door \"property\" to Hi-Scores, The Player's Club.

If Hi-Scores is the unnecessary sequel to Insert Coin(s), The Player's Club is the very unnecessary sequel to that. It is the \"Adventures of Lolo 3\" of the barcades.

We were told The Player's Club was meant to be a more lounge-y, suave version of Hi-Scores, and when we walked in, it did have a very man-cave feel with cushy chairs.

But unfortunately, the problem was it was too much like Hi-Scores. The menu was exactly the same. The game area was even SMALLER, with a few foosball tables and pinball machines.

The kicker was when I ordered a Red Bull & Vodka. I swear this is what went down.

ME: I'll have a Red Bull & Vodka.
SHE: Is there a certain type of vodka you want?
ME: [pleased by this] Sure, can I get Skyy?
SHE: Okay, we'll get that started.
[Few minutes]
SHE: We don't have Red Bull. We have Monster though.
ME: Oh. That's fine.
[Few more minutes]
SHE: Um, we don't have Skyy. Would you like Grey Goose, Belvedere...
ME: Really? Uh, Grey Goose, I guess.

So my Red Bull & Skyy has turned into a Monster & Grey Goose. Fine, whatever, par for the course for the night. A few more minutes pass, and (I'm still not kidding) the dingy server brings me a shot of Grey Goose and half a lowball of Monster, no ice.

I hate you. I hate you. I hate you. HOW DO YOU SCREW UP A RED BULL & VODKA???

I actually had to go up to the bartender and ASK for a glass of ice. I took it back to the table, threw the shot over it, then poured the Monster on top. And when they billed me, I was billed a $7 vodka shot with a $2 Monster \"bump.\"

If they thought they had any shot of me coming back, that got \"bumped\" right off the table."}
{"text":"I decided to go out with GF to have a drink before we went out shopping.  With two bars, Hi-Scores & TPCLV located in the same building this seemed like the place to do it.

TPCLV is the more laid back version of the two.  No bouncy lights off the walls and with the proverbial \"lounge\" type feel, It was a mellow place to have a cocktail or three at four o'clock in the afternoon.

Barry was great in his preparation of libations.  One of mine included the use of egg whites. That  ingredient alone if no prepared right could be a disaster but today ws not the case.

Be it the \"Prizz Frizz\" (egg white included), \"Black Horse\", or \"The Departed\" all were tasty. 

The GF and I ordered up some fries with pulled pork that were not bad at all.

All in all it was a pleasant experience and I will go back again for a sophisticated cocktail and maybe next time play a round of golf on the numerous Golden Tee golf games they have in the back."}
{"text":"We went to the high scores side of the building.Great unique food, loved the bacon wrapped corn dogs! Excellent job! While I waited for my food I played games in there 80's style arcade(no coins needed,free!) I almost missed my food :) the service was top notch! Tiffany changed the channel to the game I wanted and when another guy came in and asked to change it to yachting she told him, sorry that gentleman was here first, I'll change it after he leaves, and happily changed one of the other Tvs for him. Nice job girl! I'll be back for Monday night football and the BBQ pork French fries!"}
{"text":"Mike is AWESOME!!!! Love the atmosphere, love the food, love the unique beer cocktails! Love it all!!!"}
{"text":"I would normally give a place like this a 3 star review but this time it was a bit different.  I walked in late with a friend and the patrons were all joined in singing music from the jukebox.  Not necessarily my tunes but it was awesome to see.  It was like a sight from a tv show or movie.  That was quite enjoyable.  

The bartender, who said he was just covering for the day, was also super enjoyable.  I don't usually talk to the bartender but this guy was very sociable and friendly and even comped out drinks because we had to wait a few extra minutes for our food!  Normally I would say this is a local watering hole with a slightly older, more subdued vibe but every now and again you walk in on a special night and everything aligns and you have a great time."}
{"text":"Fun hidden bar with great food and you have to be sure to visit when Brandi is there!!  If you need games and stuff hi scores is attached."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and Louis has been here every time.

He's is the most polite, handsome bartender. He gets me food order correct and makes drinks like my savor Jesus.

He smells like baby powder and Corona.

The music is always good and the machines always pay."}
{"text":"We love the players club!! Great food, and atmosphere!! Lori and Mike are amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one hidden gem for craft beers and their food! We went there after golf, told my buddy hey let's go check this place out. No disappointment here staff was friendly, craft beer selection was way different. Some of the beers are very small batch and hard to find. Burgers were the story here. Short rib and the black & blue burgers were on point and must say you need to get the garlic fries! Nuff said I'm getting hungry"}
{"text":"I came @ 7am hungry and in need of good food and some #tlc and that's exactly what I got!!! Breezy was on shift and she was absolutely amazing and extremely attentive! 
5 stars all around QVC is %100 up to par!!! 


Hands down this place is one of the cleanest, friendliest establishments I've been to in NV on top of that the food is great and the slots are very generous!! 
I've been in customer service for over 24 yrs so I guess you can say I know a thing or two about what it takes to create life long customers and they have it down %100.
The last time I was here Breezy was on shift and as I stated I my last review she was amazing!!! This time Lori was working and she is absolutely sweet, friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and deserves a raise. 
Thank you for the wonderful experience.!!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight, all I wanted to do was to gamble some money and have a few beers...
...Ultimately, BAD staff. 
They insist on showing patrons \"the ropes\" and criticizing the way they like to play. 
Just left and will never be back.
You can easily add this to the \"Most Overrated Bars in Henderson\" list.
Basically spent $20 on 3 bottles of Budweiser because the bartender didn't like how I played poker, said others would be insulted, then proceeded to gamble most of my winnings on her forced crappy keno strategy because \"it's worked before\". 
She bullied people all around the bar, in fact. Made fun of a guy for not drinking his beer, etc.
Please work in a morgue if you don't like people with a pulse.
Any publicity is good publicity, which is the only reason why I disagree with my choice to post this review."}
{"text":"So we found this place by mistake.  We were looking for another friend that works at a bar.  So while I went to the lady's room my husband was asking about our friend and the beer's.  Well she dosn't work here but we have some beer for ya!  So by the time I got out of the ladies room my husband already picked out a beer I would like......OMG  This beer was soooooo freaking good!  Don't ask me the name of it.  Then the bartender gave us a couple of other samples, and OMG  3 beers that taste so amazing!  We will be back, and we will bring our beer drinking friends.  And the food menu looks good to!  I can't wait to come back, B-fast or lunch you will see us again!"}
{"text":"Wendy is the top 'Drink-Slinger' in the area. Everybody needs to come and check out The Players Club."}
{"text":"Great place for late night snack and food is on point! Staff is very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"Such a fun neighborhood spot. The bartender was amazing, extremely friendly and even introduced us to a new tequila that might just be one of my new favorites. We got a few drinks, played video poker then went next door and played video games (for free!). Lots of fun and nice if you're on a budget or just want a low key night. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So far so good. ...Friendly staff. They have Campri!
More to follow. P.k the wedge salad with Steve is good and the BBQ BURGER is amazing.  The Machines are hitting too. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great bar with friendly bartenders.  There is gambling, but also some arcade games in the back.  There is also additional seating away from the bar on couches or chairs. 
The food wasn't the best, 2 out of 3 times I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I was a fan going here when I visited town as I like to stay at the hotel next door. Lately the service has been slow. 

I will hope to try again next time I am there (please try and get non smoking even in the bar) you have outside and even gambling next door people can go to smoke."}
{"text":"I took a group of 18 people for a party.  There was something for everyone.  My friends watched the football game, enjoyed great drinks and played many of the classic video games and poker games that were available.  We had a fabulous dinner that was a great value.  To top it off, they provided a delicious on-site baked birthday cake for our celebration.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place for a fun night out. I understand they serve a great breakfast too."}
{"text":"Usually, the good here is AMAZING! Which is why when friends were visiting from Maine, we brought them here for brunch. It was awful! Instead of pancakes as advertised, they served waffles that were about 1/4\" thick and were more than likely frozen waffles. The eggs & bacon was ok - but certainly not great and definitely not worth the price. Will never come from brunch again. We were so embarrassed!"}
{"text":"I've had good experiences at this bar. The food is good and decently priced. But I'm pretty sure when a bar tender is giving you double shots they're suppose to AT LEAST let you know. That way your not surprised once you get your tab. We had 8 drinks all together and none were comped after our gaming. She supposedly took \"care\" of the double shots which we never asked for and 2 beers. I don't know but the bar tender seemed a bit shady. And I've had issues with her before but this time takes the cake. I won't go back whenever she is bartending."}
{"text":"My friend lives just a short walk away from here. He said everyone raves about the Braised Short Ribs so he really was curious to try it out himself. 

The bar was small and cozy and our server was nice and attentive.
Drinks were carefully measured with the use of a jigger, so it was pretty weak. We didn't taste any alcohol in our drinks but it was a late night (I just landed from Honolulu an hour ago) and we weren't looking to get smashed so it's all good.

BRAISED SHORT RIBS  ($17):
http://bit.ly/2llZPQ9
Slow-braised in a red wine and vegetable stock. It was okay, nothing blew my socks off but it was definitely very tender as the entire piece of bone was easily pulled out. Needed salt though. 
The mashed potatoes were the most flavorful part of the dish, but a bit salty and way too much garlic. After a few forks-full, my friend and I couldn't taste anything else because of the overwhelming presence of garlic. 

JALAPEÑO JACK TENDERS  (3 pcs for $10):
http://bit.ly/2lmehYI
Was excited to see this on the menu after reading the description. 
But unfortunately pre-made frozen chicken tenders were used.  Each tender was topped off with a slice of pepper jack cheese. The jalapeño ranch dipping sauce didn't really have much of a jalapeño in it, basically just seasoned ranch dressing. 
The fresh pico di gallo was tasty though. 

Overall, nice place to get your grub on and the drinks are free when you're gambling there (our total bill was just $29 for the food only)."}
{"text":"I love to hang out here.  It's not real loud & \"sports\" oriented.  Lori B is the best bartender. She plays our favorite music, cheers for us to win & is right there to fill your glass! When her and Michael work together it's a hoot for sure"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch one day as I was in the area and originally was going to check out Hi-Scores. Little did I know that both places share the same building. The Players Club is the adult side, with a gaming bar, and a few arcade style things in the back. I didn't really go back there and check it out as I was limited on time.

The menu looked very interesting with some upgraded bar food style meals. I opted for the chicken strips and waffles. It wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping, so I was a bit disappointed in this version. I've had some great chicken and waffles at other places. I would definitely come back to try a few other meals that looked good though.

Service was good, but not super friendly. Too bad because she was pretty. It wasn't that busy either, just me and two other guys across the bar."}
{"text":"The right hand side of HiScores (often referred to as the elder side) offers a slightly less hectic vibe. Poker is king (smiley face) and all the same fine brews can be had for the asking as the left hand side. This has always been the less crowded of the 2 bars every time I'm here. There is more seating here, including couches/chairs. I believe there are also a few video games although the other side has the majority of them. Pick right if you want a less noisy video poker or video gaming experience. 
Having the choice of 2 \"different\" bars is nice and you can drag your bevvies with you if you switch sides."}
{"text":"Love this place their wings are scrumptious, garlic Parm fries num num num num and their service is amazing I look forward to Henderson layovers for this place alone"}
