{"text":"Went this afternoon and ordered pork lomein and sweet/sour chicken.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Stopped in for lunch for the first time. Big portions.  Quick service. As the other reviewer noted they are mostly takeout with only 4 tables for eating in.  Sesame chicken was cooked well and tasty.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place in the area. Good food at a good price. Have been a regular customer and never have had any issues."}
{"text":"I firmly believe that it is the best Chinese take-out around. The sauces are very smooth and rich, serving size is stupendous, and the staff is quite friendly. I have been going here for a long, long time. I am used to seeing their child sitting around keeping busy while everyone is cooking. It is a great place. Alike everyother place in the history of quick Chinese/Japanese take out the chicken on the entrees is not the best and rather fatty, but you cannot escape that. Otherwise I would easily point you in the direction of Best Wok for an outstanding trip to get take out. I typically get the Sesame beef, General Tso, and Beef with Broccoli. Try it, it is safe!"}
{"text":"I normally get orange chicken at every Chinese place but I got sweet and sour here. And we loved it. It's seemed to be very clean. Cannot wait to try their orange chicken."}
{"text":"Okay so I went out on a limb and tried this after reading the excellent reviews and I was let down. I read that it's the \"best\" ever and sadly it doesn't even fall in the good category. It was your typical Chinese food, typical taste nothing different. The service was fast, the inside is small, the plates are big for the price so that's the upside. It tastes like any other local Chinese place with the disadvantage being they don't deliver. For quick and average Chinese food it's fine. But don't listen to all the hype if you're a true Chinese buff."}
{"text":"food is always fresh hot and delicious! I highly recommend. It may take a little longer to prep but that is because they make it fresh! I always suggest ordering online if you don't like waiting for 20-30 mins. Also the Combo platters that allow you to pick two items and includes fried rice and an eggroll are a great value and have awesome options to choose from. Dinner for 2 for less that $20, and usually there is enough for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. I've been here a ton for their amazing wonton soup and I just tried the honey chicken for the first time , it was delicious! Service was very fast and friendly as always"}
{"text":"Ive been going to Best Wok for around 10 years now. They are in my opinion the best Chinese restaurant in Parma. I usually get the mixed vegetable platter, and they make it for me with veg fried rice and allow me to sub the spring roll for the usual egg roll. Good food and the price is competitive."}
{"text":"Parma is seriously lacking in good Chinese options, but Best Wok has been around FOREVER! I remember it opening as a kid, but for some reason, I waited like twenty years before finally checking it out. They have your standard Chinese takeout counter, with several tables if you want to eat in. But let's be honest, you don't come here for the ambiance. You could here for the classic, perfectly greasy takeout. My friend who is vegan loves to come here for the fried rice, which is apparently vegan. I got an egg roll and sweet and sour chicken. It really hit the spot and was exactly what I expected. Definitely check out Best Wok if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Please select pics for reply or review. Good portions for the price. Fed six people with leftovers for under $50."}
{"text":"Of all the Chinese take out restaurants in the area, Best Wok is definitely the best. The food is consistent. I always receive the same high quality and friendly service. The staff is open to requests and is willing to modify their dishes as needed. I think their won ton soup is the best around and their combination platters allow for a lot of food for a very small amount of money. I've never eaten inside the restaurant but there are table available and usually a few are taken by dine in customers. I won't get Chinese take out from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Best Wok seems like it has been here forever.  I don't even remember when they first opened, but I've been eating here since I was a teenager.    Best Wok has a unique flavor in their fried rice.  It's really tasty and is dark in color.  On my last visit to Best Wok, I had an egg roll and some chicken fried rice.  It was really delicious.    My wife ordered BBQ spare ribs, which she absolutely loves, and pork fried rice.  This was the first time she has ever eaten here since living in the United States.  There are so many restaurants around here that I can spend the rest of my life sampling new food.  That's a good thing, right?  Anyway, she liked the food and we'll return again."}
{"text":"Mediocre, at best. Not sure why so many good ratings. All of the dishes basically taste the same. Kung Pao chicken was the let down this time. Schezwan pepper flavor, which IS Kung Pao, was drastically lacking. The pieces of chicken themselves are pretty much inedible. I don't know how they cooked it but it's mushy and slimy. I don't even know how you could make chicken like that."}
{"text":"Out of 2 meals : The fortune cookies, and the single egg-roll take the win... Felt cheated afterwards!   Zero flavor.   The fortune cookie should never take place in \"best part of the meal\"... NO!!"}
{"text":"I was in Parma and planning to get chipotle for dinner but I saw Best Wok in the same plaza so I gave it a try. Clean inside, there's about 4 tables only. Looks to be primarily take out. They have an $8.75 combination for two entrees, rice, egg roll  I picked. I got chicken & broccoli and beef & broccoli. They charged extra for plain fried rice which is kind of annoying. Overall it was good. I would go back."}
