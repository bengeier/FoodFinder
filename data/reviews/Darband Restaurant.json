{"text":"Good food, good service.   Nice portion sizes for Kabob with rice combos, it could however use a little bit more than just a chunk of Onion + herbs as \"salad\"  I'll most definitely recommend this place for meat lovers,  but not so much for people that wants a more balanced meal."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this restaurant  and we decided to give it a try. There were 4 of us and it was the first day of 2016. Happy New Year!  Back to the review...  It's in a small plaza and the place itself is rather small too. Fortunately, a table was leaving right when we arrived so we got a nice booth by the window. The service was pretty quick and we got our appetizers in no time. Hubby and I had \"mast-o-moosir\" (yoghurt+little pieces of shallots) and \"mast-o-khiar\" (yogurt+cucumber+mint). Our friends got the kashk-e-bademjoon (grilled and mashed eggplants+curd). For our main course we got Vaziri and Soltani Kabobs. Both were grilled to perfection. They came with a huge pile of delicious rice. A very nice thing about this place was that they give you the option to choose leg or breast for the chicken kabob. We also had \"doogh\" (yogurt drink) which was also great.  Darband is for sure going to be a place that we're going back to for some great and tasty Persian food."}
{"text":"Been coming here for well over ten years, I used to work in the neighbourhood so I would eat here maybe 2-3 times a week some weeks. Even though I now no longer work in North York and live downtown I'll still make a special trip to eat here sometimes, best Gormeh Sabzi I've had in the city and the pricing and portions are amazing...rather eat here than a lot of Persian places DT."}
{"text":"I've been to every iranian restaurant in Toronto, Darband is the only restaurant I go to now for breakfast lunch and dinner,... best halim in North America"}
{"text":"After almost 4 years we got a chance to try their kalle pache; it was so good that we came back in a few days and tried it again. Their service and the restaurant environment was all right too. It could be better by hiring more staff to get things done faster."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here. Ordered the soda yogurt drink and I was unaware the glass was cracked. When I went to drink it, a piece of glass broke off and cut my lip as well as my finger when I removed the glass. The owner did not take action at all and was hesitant to apologize. The owner was extremely reluctant to refund the bill and needed heavy persuasion from us. Will not recommended this place to any of my family or friends and it will be the first and last time going there. Very disappointed after seeing the rating for this place."}
{"text":"Love that they are open 24/7 without compromising their food. Ordered barg kabob and it tasted great. Even at 12 am the restaurant was full which is likely due to their great reputation for serving quality food. Not the best service in the world but it's definitely overshadowed by the great food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We tried Kale Pache. It was very good, clean, and delicious. Great quality and proportion. Price is very reasonable. The working hours is very good. I loved the place overall.    Nimroo and halim was great too."}
{"text":"I'd give the food \"3\" stars as it's above average, however customer service gets \"-3\"! We had a terrible experience there when visiting with a group of friends; some of whom wear hijab. After having lunch, when we were leaving the restaurant, a random lady sitting at another table started shouting at and cursing those who were wearing hijab, and giving hate speech. Then a man sitting at another table joined her and even got physical with one of our friends. The staff acted very unprofessionally and instead of silencing them or asking them to leave, they claimed it's our fault and we must leave the restaurant!!  Although we could call the police, we didn't want to make a scene and ruin the day for others who'd come to the restaurant to enjoy lunch with family & friends. It's absolutely unacceptable and the management should make sure this type of behaviour is confronted strictly, not encouraged!"}
{"text":"Absoutely HORIBBLE service. Never, ever go there if you have a choice. Waitress forgot my order after being reminded three times. In the end I cancelled it and told them I will not be coming again. ThisÂ was the second time I had gone and the second time I had a missed order."}
{"text":"Went in on an early Saturday evening. Place was relatively empty. While initially the service was not very fast (took a while to get our menus), after we had ordered the food came VERY quickly. For the price, portions were very large. Beef and chicken kabobs were large and flavorful. The rice was light and fluffy, but lacked flavour (which might just be stye). Each dish came with a roasted tomato, which added a nice pop of color to the plate, in addition to being delicious. Overall, good value."}
{"text":"The environment, is not classy at all. But that would be the only flaw. The food is very good. The price is quite fair. 10.99 for Kalleh (half of a sheep's head) seemed fair to me.  They serve the bread+vegetables+onions first which I am a huge fan of. Great place for the fatty food craving after a night of drinking. Or a lunch."}
{"text":"Right here you would enjoy the real great taste of East. My first visit was 2002, and since then I enjoyed and liked every bite I ever got. You can not find easily a restaurant maintains the very high quality and keeps the place clean over all these years. I prefer to give them 10 stars, two thumbs up and whatever it needs to appreciate their effort to give us the great genuine Persian food"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for 4 days and I went there twice as the food was excellent. Especially Kallepacheh :D. They served it soon after we ordered that. It was in a reasonable price ~11 bucks for one which includes almost everything in it. The good point about it is that they are open 24/7 and they serve everything whenever you go there. I suggest they provide their info on the website, so I hope they do it soon. Finally, I hope they bring Sangak bread to serve with Kallepacheh in future."}
{"text":"My mom really likes this place we eat here almost once a week, but it's really good for 10$ a plate for the koobideh with rice not to mention really filling.. The meat is so tender and really has u craving for more even on a full stomach!!! And the place being 24/7 I haven't gone after hours but again that's a plus!!"}
{"text":"It's open 24/7 which is amazing. Sultani and waziri are my favourite meals; they are delicious, juicy and tender."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and cooked absolutely perfectly. The service was ok. I got the feeling this place is mostly frequented by Middle Eastern customers so I felt a bit out of place (white as the driven snow I am!). What puts it over the top is the hours - 24 hours for GOOD Mid Eastern food. Haven't found that anywhere else. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and if theres one thing I can vouche for, its the consistency!  Every dish we order tastes the same every time and that is a crucial feature for any food joint.  Ive read reviews regarding bad service, but I can honestly say I have never experienced this. The waitresses arent naturally smiley (resting bitch face syndrome?) but they're friendly and efficient and do smile on occasion which in my mind is just as good!  The service is also quick, weve never had to wait long at all and all food is always fresh and hot.   The food is amazing, great portions and well priced. Their meat is tender and tasty as is their chicken. Their skewers are HUGE which justifies the price for individual skewers (10.99 for chicken breast skewer). Their rice is deliciously fluffy too. My favorite side is the kashk bademjan...an amazinggg eggplant side...I crave it sometimes.  The food area is clean and well kept, I cant vouche for the kitchen because it is behind closed doors. This place loses one star because of its washroom. They are not visibly dirty...but the smell....is truly gross. Maybe they have a plumbing problem?"}
{"text":"After all the recommendations I finally got a chance to trying this place.   I ordered the koobideh kebab to go. It was piping hot and delicious! Lots of extra garnishes included.  Service was friendly as well.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A great late night diner with good taste, quality and portion. The food is fresh of the grill and very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"This quaint little spot is a hidden gem. We've had the Sharazi, Sabze Pollo, Kashk Bademjan, and more, and they were all excellent. I come here for its own sake, and before road trips; I'd much rather have authentic Persian cuisine than crappy bland food I can pickup on the road."}
{"text":"The food & service was excellent. We were so in hurry to catch our flight, they accommodate us very well. We ate Soltani kabob with half rice and salad. It was very delicious. The yogurt with shallot was so good too. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went in and went out. Tables and seats were dirty full of food particles not wiped properly.  Before we ordered our food bread was offered in a plastic bag and in the bag was fruitflies.  I brought that to the waitress's attention she brought another and that one had fruit flies too. I'm pretty  sure the food might be good but the cleanliness was definitely subpar."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. AMAZING! We watched a play nearby last night and by the time it was done, we were starving! It was 11pm, and we were looking to EAT. This place is open 24 hrs! And they were very busy at this time of night, the restaurant was pretty full, and new customers were constantly arriving.. and I could see why -- the food was SO good and the servers were SO friendly.  I've never had Persian food before, and I can't believe I've been missing this my whole life. We ordered the Gheimeh Bademjan, which is a stew of veal with roasted eggplant and a delicious sauce. The flavours were like nothing I've had before, in the most magical way possible. It's served with a huge plate of rice (and of course, naan, onions, and some other garnish for the table). I ate the WHOLE thing even though I was stuffed after eating half the portion (I may have unbuttoned my jeans on my way home).  My partner got the lambshank and dill rice. That was also very good -- the meat was falling off the bones! I will say that compared to my very-flavourful stew, this dish was a bit bland, but it was still very delicious.  Now that I've discovered this place (and my apparent love for Persian food) I will DEFINITELY be back -- especially because it's open 24hrs!!  It's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"So I wouldn't come here on \"date night\" b/c of the ambiance and the food selection.  But I did visit here recently (solo lunch event) and had an amazing experience.  I ordered the Kebab Koobideh on bread.    The kebab came on three thin cuts of Lavash bread which soak up all the juices from the kebab (Yumm).  They served pita bread on the side (which I didn't touch).  In addition, the meal came with onions, lime, parsley and roosted tomatoes.    This is old country comfort food. The kebab and Lavash bread were excellent.  The lime and onions were not fresh at all but I didn't mind too much.  The service was good.  I was there for a late lunch and there were only a couple of tables so the waitress was very attentive.    If you are in the neighbourhood for lunch (alone or with a good friend) and looking for good simple food in an uncomplicated setting, this is the place. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy, but the zereshk polo and koobideh were delicious. If I am in the neighbourhood, would definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"My favorite koobideh place. So tender and juicy! And the rice is airy and slightly buttered. Highly addicting when combined. This $8.99 dish is a big portion and can last 1-4 meals depending on how you hungry you are or how much you ration it.  Their Mahicheh and Baghali Polo (Lamb Shank with dill/broad bean rice) is also so good! The lamb shank is fall of the bone tender and the sauce is so flavourful. I'm not a big fan of their dill rice though and prefer the rice that comes with the Koobideh."}
{"text":"Under normal circumstances Darband would get a 4/5 rating. However because they are open 24/7 and serve proper food around the clock they deserve a 5/5. Their quality of food has recently improved a lot and their prices are very reasonable for what you get. It is not a high-end restaurant of course. The newly improved Halim is a great choice, which is also a bit rare to find in the GTA."}
{"text":"Been going to Darband since it opened about 15 years ago,  and over the years as owners have changed so has the quality of the food and service.  I am happy to say that as of late the food has been outstanding.  I can't really comment too much on service as we usually take out large orders for family get togethers.  That being said our orders are always ready on time and presentation and taste is amazing.  Great work Darband!"}
{"text":"The food is cooked to perfection and the prices whore fair. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This was the first time that we have been in an Iranian restaurant. We came here as we were in the mood for Kebabs, was close to our place and had good reviews.   We came in around 9:30pm on a Saturday and the place was fairly busy. It's 24 hours. It's not a big restaurant and it can get a little tight if you are not seating in the booths. Minimal decor but they have two large screens TV with Persian music videos on. The wait staff was helpful and patient with us as we were the only non Persian people in the restaurant and weren't sure what to order.   We ordered the Lamb Shank with dill rice and the Chicken and Ground Beef dish with Jasmine rice. I found the Lamb delicious although my wife thought it had a strong smell. I didn't noticed nor did I mind. The dill rice was very good. The Chicken and Ground Beef was good too although a bit salty. The pita bread provided a nice balance to the meats. The portion sizes are huge. It might be a good idea to share a dish if you are not too hungry.   Also my wife noticed how each table had what it looked like a Yogurt soft drink which we later found out from our waitress that it was Ayran. We ordered one to try it. The mixture of Cold Yogurt with salt was not something we were expecting. It's not something we are going to order again but it was good that we tried it.   We enjoyed our dining experience and we'll come back again.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"My favourite Persian place in Toronto. My husband and I drive from downtown to come here on the weekends. It's 24hr and the food is always fresh!  My favourite is the \"Asheh Reshteh\" which is a thick Persian Soup with beans, noodles, greens and s topped with whey and fried onions.  The \"Koobedeh\" is outstanding as well.  My husband's favourite is the \"Kashkeh Bdemjoon\" which is a roasted eggplant."}
{"text":"This place is 5 minutes from my house and I've been passing by it for 10+ years.  I was skeptical of this place because it's in a small unknown plaza, but the yelp reviews convinced me to check it out. Plus, I've been always meaning to try Persian food.   I ordered the koobideh for take out and I was thrilled at the amount of food I got for less than $10. The koobideh kebab was easy to eat and has a hint of lamb and onions to it. It also tasted good and it was nice to try other Middle Eastern foods other than the regular kebabs and gyros."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo chicken breast and ground beef kabobs with rice. The chicken was well seasoned and not dry at all! The ground beef had a bit of gamey taste to it but otherwise delicious! I could definitely taste the charred meat in both. The rice complimented the meat nicely and it also came with a side of grilled tomato. The service was quick and the staff was friendly. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The food is great, and service is great too. It's also not expensive, which makes easy to frequent. Have probably been there at least a dozen times. What I don't like about the service is how they bring 4-5 layers of pita bread in a plastic bag! I don't understand this practice. First of all, other people put their hands in the plastic bag, so makes the bacteria stay in the bag for next customer. Second of all, the bread is cold. It makes zero sense, and they have been doing it for a long time. A better option is to bring the bread in a plate, and maybe warmed up or toasted. But in the plastic?   But aside from this complaint, I have to say the food is very delicious and good for the price. Will continue to go but I hope they change how they serve the bread..."}
{"text":"I think this place is very famous within Persians.   The place is not very fancy, no special interior design that reminds u this  place is a persian restaurant.  The food: They serve either white pita bread or rice with Kebabs. The rice was not very delicious as Persian rice should be. Our order had Shirazi Salad, it was very salty and weird. Koobideh, was good but the Barg, was not very great as u always expect it.  Overall this place worth trying, staff are nice and polite too."}
{"text":"Being half Persian, nothing compares to family dinners. All the dishes are prepared over the course of hours sometimes days. It's definitely no easy feat if you decide to make homemade Persian food, luckily, for us foodies, Darband takes it for the win producing as close to home cooking as possible. This is the restaurant Persians go to when they want to eat out. Definitely the most authentic tasting Persian cuisine that won't cost you an arm and a leg like some restaurants have chosen to do throughout toronto and the gta. For first time customers I recommend you get the dish most people get and what Persians are most famous for, the kabob koobideh( ground beef skewers, rice with saffron , grilled tomato). The beef is fantastically produced. Always juicy, and unfortunately for my mother, better than hers. (She'd kill me if she saw this) if you're feeling adventurous and want to try a great dish get the \" khoresh ghormeh sabzi \", or you can say green stew if you're too afraid to pronounce that; Consisting of parsley , leeks, cilantro , fenugreek and red kidney beans with either lamb cubes or beef , this dish is guaranteed to satisfy your curiosity. Staff is very nice, service is quick. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food is OK and the price is good. Customer service is not so great. It really would help the place if the personnel act nicer."}
{"text":"Visited last week, they were out of ice ! and one lady was doing everything from serving and collection checks and ... sounds like challenging situation she had. the food was average , basmati rice was a cheap one that you can have at Super Khorak and alike."}
{"text":"24/7 open wins my heart, but wait that's not the only reason.This place is by far the most delicious Persian food i have had around here.So this is old restaurant with no fancy frills attached.I have visited them way too many times to claim that their food is always consistent.  Lets get started with the food.Its fresh, very tasteful and great for the $$$. My standard order here is the kash-e-badejamen which is a paste like eggplant appetizer garnished with fried brown onions, fried mint and dollops of goat milk cream-its heaven on a plate. They do give free khaboos/pita.I also order the Koobideh kabobs which are my ultimate fav. here, they are juicy and bursting of flavors-this entrÃ©e comes with saffron rice and char-grilled tomatoes. They are two big kabobs in this platter, when here do try this. Last but mot the least whenever they do have it on the menu I order Jigar which is liver on the skewers, I absolutely love love them. So they sell these by the skewers and each one is under $4.The liver is perfectly grilled without too many spices and its great with a squeeze of lime.  This place has great service, the ladies there are welcoming and quick. Like I mentioned in my introduction this isn't a fancy place so the dÃ©cor and ambience is very average. I would have given them a full 5 stars if they had better bathrooms. Last time I used them and their taps don't function too well and that kinda ticked me off. These little details are very very important to me. There is shortage of parking outside. Money wise this place is very reasonable my last bill was $35 which included the tax and my last order can been seen via my most recent pics.  If you are Persian food lover this is definitely the place to go, I assure you that you won't be disappointed.I live so far from this place that i don't come here very often, but i do make special trips  to North York just to devour their delicious food."}
{"text":"In my last review, I mentioned that I was craving Darband's specialty lamb dishes the day after I first tried them. Well, yesterday, about a week since I first tried Darband, I've come again.   This time, I did more research, and I double checked my findings with the lovely lady on the phone. I ordered zaban (tongue. This one was lamb) to go. I was told it would only take about five minutes. This usually means something's been simmering on the stove for quite a while. I was told that the zaban was cooked in water seasoned with salt and pepper, if I'm not mistaken. I was also told that it was served that way, and that one usually eats it with bread. That didn't sound particularly appealing to me (bread in water?), but I was pretty sure she meant broth, because afterwards, she told me it was sort of like soup. When I got it at home, it was broth! Delicious, delicious broth. Huzzah. I was told I was supposed to squeeze lime in it, and so I did. Not much, but enough to taste it. I wasn't particularly a fan of the lime+broth combination, because I found that the lime cut the lamb flavor down, but I can see why it would be appealing to some.  I'd totally get this again. Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"The Kalle Pache is to die for, reasonable price, open 24 hours, conveniently located just east of york mills exit (near york mills exit and don valley parkway) on DVP. I had been there at least 6 times in last 2 years and been surprised every time. Food may take a little longer to serve but its worth a wait. food is 5* Only thing I gave 4* was they were playing tv shows and the noise was loud. This is one of our fev place and definitely we'll go there again."}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice and friendly, the food was really great compare to the price. \"Kale\" was the best I think! I will try it again."}
{"text":"Persian food available 24/7 WHAT?! Nice alternative when you want a filling meal late at night or early in the morning that's NOT fast food. Important note: 10% added to order if you're there between midnight and 7am.  Terrible time driving into the plaza from the far side of the busy road because not all drivers in the opposing lane leave you a space to get through when the traffic stops at the red light: JERKS! Might as well make a u turn to skip the hassle. Small, filled parking area in the front but many more spaces in the back of the plaza.  When we entered the restaurant, it took the waitress a few minutes to acknowledge us since it looked liked they were trying to resolve a problem at the back of the room. We were greeted with a smile and led to a large booth even though it was only me and hubby: I would suggest getting one of the comfy booths around the perimeter because the tables in the middle are squished together so not much leg or elbow room.  We ordered the Kashk Bademjam (puree of golden fried eggplant with onion whey and mint), Persian soup (veggies, noodles, pinto beans, whey, sauteed garlic and mint), and Koobideh (charbroiled, seasoned ground beef) Kebab with rice. The complementary (flat)bread was cold and tasted day old. The eggplant appetizer was too mushy and slightly slimy, bleh! There was something funky going on with the soup: musty smell and terrible taste (hey, I've tried durian before so the smell didn't deter me from at least trying it). The kebab, thankfully, was delicious: juicy, tender and flavorful. The accompanying rice was a little too oily for my taste.  Our waitress was nice and pleasant but the other one didn't crack a smile but was helpful. Occasionally both of them would disappear into the kitchen so we'd have to wait before we could get serviced.   I wouldn't mind coming back for more delicious, succulent kebab if I was in the mood for late night eats AND I was in the area."}
{"text":"Honestly, i always have had the most delicious HALIMS at this place. From their ASHRESHTE TO KEBABS everything is perfect. Sometimes they have kalepacheh which is fresh and tasty. Its nice to see they still have it going on. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I went there with Dr. Aria a good friend of mine who introduced this restaurant to me. I tried the chicken kebab and the Barg with rice, I have to admit that it was the most delicious food that  I've had among all the other Persian restaurants so far in Toronto area. Ms. Roya was very friendly and helpful and provided us a fantastic service.  From now on I will go there for Persian food and also will recommend this restaurant to all my friends. No more North, Zaffron , Sardab, Shishlick and Shiraz restaurants.   Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"I'm a regular there. Each time of my visit, the food was just great. Its Kabab, Ash, and chicken are always perfectly-cooked and well-seasoned. Its price is absolutely reasonable and fully worth it. It is not a fancy restaurant, but for sure a cozy one. The staffs are usually friendly and fast, but I remember few occasions, mostly late shifts, that they did not offer good service. Overall, it is doubtlessly placed among the top five Persian restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"There is no way you can miss this place. If you want a great food, great time and happy stomach then this is the place you need to go to. Wonderful menu with a lot of delicious choices, which will make your belly confused and excited  just order as many as you can if you don't mind to eat too much at least for one day"}
{"text":"I love kebabs. Like I go everywhere - all the time after the worlds best - which is probably inside of Tehran.   Listen up. This place is a solid 3/5 - but as we all know 2 vacant spaces are irritating.   This company has potential but they need to grab it by the ears and own that shit.   This is somewhat of a failure food joint - which is really sad. However as long as you order the right things that dance on your tongue a then you're all set"}
{"text":"WHAT a TREAT! Flew in at night and on a limb decided to see if there were any Persian restaurants still open. And voila! This restaurant is open 24/7 and to even more of a surprise, it was right next to our hotel - so we had no excuse not to go.  The food we ordered was some eggplant stew and lamb neck! Fingerlicking good! The staff was friendly and ambiance had a Persian vibe to it. Will definitely return back before we leave back to the US.  Out of all Persian placed we've been to in the us (East and West coast), this by far only comes close to stuff you can get in LA."}
{"text":"This is probably the BEST Persian food I've had...when I first encountered it about 5 years ago, the Koobideh was so amazing, very juicy and full of life! Now, unfortunately its become a little dry, but still excellent!  The portion sizes are great, and the service is okay, but more than make up for it with the quality of the food! :)  Try a cup of tea after dinner...it will hit the spot!"}
{"text":"The food gets almost five stars except for a rather short menu.  The soup (only one listed) is fabulous, and kebabs were very generous, well-flavoured and tender.  Rating is pulled down by both atmosphere and service.  The place looks like a dingy old street bar, despite being in a modern strip plaza.   It is not dirty, just does not have a comfortable atmosphere.  The service is friendly but extremely slow, even when not busy.  They are open 24 hours, which is nice to know.  If they could pick up the service a bit, make it look a little more inviting and add a couple of appetizers and mains to the menu it would be a five start eatery."}
{"text":"I've dined in and had take outs on more occasions than I can remember.  Over the years, they have renovated the restaurant but the interior has always felt too dark for my liking.  It was pretty busy for a Saturday night take out at 6:30 pm and considering I had called in my order some 30 min before going to pick it up, I did not expect to wait as long as I did (some additional 20 min) to get my food.    We usually get the trusty favorites:  koobideh, chenje, jujeh..etc. and they are all very decent.  We tend to stick to the grilled items as opposed to stews solely for the reason that Persian kabobs hit just the rights spots for us.    I would not say that Darband serves up the best Persian kabobs I've had but since it's so conveniently located (from work) and open 24 hrs, you just can't beat this place.  I'll continue to come to Darband or our Persian kabob fix unless I stumble upon a new joint closer to home and serving up just as good food."}
{"text":"LOVE THAT ITS 24/7 It's authentic  Ashe reshte: 5/5 better than moms :)  Koobedeh: 4/5 moist and tender but I like more garlic and onions in it   Ghormeh Sabzi: 3/5 tasteless fixes the urge but I prefer my mothers 100%  Over all a good place to eat KOOBEDEH :)"}
{"text":"I've been going to Darband for over 10 years and they've been key for those long nights since they're open 24 hours and are Halal. Good prices but the Koobideh Kabab has a certain smell to it that can be a bit overwhelming...I prefer Afghani over this nowadays, but it's good to know that Darband is always there for those 2am Kabab cravings"}
{"text":"Awesome food,  good price and best of all huge portions. Underestimated portion sizes there vs places in ottawa."}
{"text":"I like their kubideh kebab with shirazi salad and friend of mine enjoyed the kaleh pache,so tasty and fresh. Its impressing that they are open 24hours. Our two servers were both super nice."}
{"text":"Not A Favourite, But Good.  There was lots of rice and kabob on my plate, but that has been the case with every Iranian restaurant I visited. I am getting the hang of this kabob and rice thing. The menu does list a few things that I had not seen at other Iranian restaurant like tongue, liver and other special sides. I actually ordered a Bagali polo which was described as vegetable rice and meat but the waitress anoyingly came back to say it is sold out two minutes after recommending it! Fine barg it was. It was good but not the best I have had because of a slightly funky meat taste. Te rice was delicious and the tomato was well grilled. The restaurant is smaller than other Iranian ones I have been to and was quite noisy. When we came out there was a poster for the business next door in the same ugly plaza that say \"state-of-the-art sterilization.\" WHAT?? I like Iranian food and the quantity is satisfying. I just don't understand how the patrons are not all fat after all the bread, butter, rice, kabob, baklava and so forth"}
{"text":"Darband is as good as it gets. Their koobideh is best I've had in North America. It comes with perfectly grilled tomato and buttery rice. Chicken breast is also delicious. It's open 24/7 so get your kabob fix anytime. End your meal with their delicious Persian tea."}
{"text":"Ordered to go, took about 25 mins but well worth the wait. Their koobideh was  out of this world. Very happy customer. Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Wowowoww! Very filling! Husband and I shared a plate for about 21.00 and split in half. It was just enough for the both of us! Sooooo good! Will come back again! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"Quality is above average Clean area Staff are good Service is Ok 24 hours business hours is excellent Prices are great Result: Value for money!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Kaleh. Open 24/7 like 7/11.  Reasonable prices, I recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"The BEST thing about this place is that it's always open! I don't think they ever close?! A great spot if you're out late, from work or partying or whatever it is, to find a good decent meal other than a fast food option. Their kababs are delicious, both kobideh and Sultani, as well as the chicken Kababs. They also have real authentic dishes that you won't find at your typical Persian restaurant. Service is always good and you get your food fast. The place could use some renovations, I've never seen anything done to it in the past 10 years maybe! It does look a little beat-up. They also offer takeout, which is real good since the place isn't too big and it gets full quickly at times.  in terms of food, great spot"}
{"text":"I went to check out this restaurant based on the good review from yelp. It was a pleasant surprise! When we arrived there on a weekend afternoon around 3pm,  the restaurant was packed which was a good sign as the restaurants in the same plaza were all dead at that time.  The service was great compare to other persian restaurants. Usually if you go to a persian place and you aren't persian, they wouldn't treat you nice, but this is not the case here. The servers were friendly, smiling and served us right away after we walked in.   We ordered the chicken leg kabob with rice and it only cost $11.99. The chicken was so juicy and tender. It was so good that I didn't want to waste time taking pictures. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Small place very crowded. Takes a long time for food to come. Decent food. Open after midnight is a plus but they charge 10% more for orders after midnight."}
{"text":"The food is not bad , my 1 star review is about the billing and cheque system .im not sure why are they charging more than their own price list ! Once we had overcharged for 3 bucks on a $15 bill but we were almost by the the house when we noticed .the next time they were trying over charge us by 7 dollars on a 20 dollars bill. But we had it in mind from the last time so they got it fixed . ALWAYS check how much you are paying and how much you're supposed to pay when buying from this place . Also unlike non of the the restaurants in T town they charge extra 10% at night !!!"}
{"text":"Food: 4 or even 5 stars. We tried their bath, joojeh (breast meat) and koobideh kabob as well as kashke-badenjan and mast-mooseer for appetizers. All good especially kashke-base jan which is roasted eggplant mixed with a few things like fried onions.   Ambiance: 2-3 stars. It can improve.  Service: 2-3 stars. Servers can be more friendly and MORE PATIENT.  Prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other day for lunch. Had a good experience. It is a nice little place. Good quality food, good prices and great quantities. I definitely recommend it. The hostess/server was very courteous. She exchanged pleasantries, was smiling and attentive.  Overall it was a good experience"}
