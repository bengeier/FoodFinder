{"text":"Popeye's is good ...yummy good....but this location makes me want to go to other locations. The lines are long long long, service is slow slow slow, the cashier was practically yelling across to put an order in.   You'll be waiting here  a long time to get yo' grub on!"}
{"text":"All the Popeye's Chicken in Toronto, Canada serve certified Halal Meat! I Ordered some take-out from this location. Had the mini-chicken biscuit burgers - very good! Also had the chicken sandwich on ciabatta bun - also excellent! Can't go wrong with the mashed potatoes either. great stuff!"}
{"text":"I love this place and jump at the chance to go since it's somewhat out of the way for me.  The chicken is perfectly crisp and crunchy and the cajun fries are delicious and the packets of louisana sauce you can drizzle over the fries.  Also they give a generous amount of fries and the pieces of chicken are always big.  I definitely choose this place over KFC and Mary Browns.  My boyfriend gets the spicy chicken sandwich and he loves it, I on the other hand prefer to go with the 3 piece bonafide combo."}
