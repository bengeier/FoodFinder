{"text":"Long line ups at this location and there is very little place to sit. The place is quite small so there is virtually no room to even stand in line properly. The drinks are pretty decent but I didn't love any of the ones I've tried so far. If I ever feel like chatime, I'll likely try a different drink at another location."}
{"text":"This place is hidden from the intersection and it is behind the plaza of the supermarket at Leslie and Finch. Found a parking spot immediately when entering the parking lot which was a bit of a bonus considering the amount of restaurants in the plaza it is located.   Ordered a roasted milk tea with tapioca, less ice and sugar. At first when I received my drink, the sugar syrup and milk was poorly mixed (the tea was still mostly at the bottom). The tapioca was hard and took a while to chew - it definitely was not cooked long enough. I could taste the milk powder as I was drinking it. This Chatime location isn't as good as the one I usually go to at Warden and Steeles. I only came here because I was craving bubble tea and this location was nearby. Probably not coming back here."}
{"text":"Had a great selection of teas and nice service. They were very busy but helpful and smiling which goes a long way!"}
{"text":"I visit this Chatime often as we come to this plaza often for dinner.  There is ample parking (we usually park in the parking lot on the second floor) and this location is very clean.  Drink quality is good and I've never had to wait long to order or get my drinks.  The staff is friendly too.    Tip: This location has board game nights on Tuesdays.  I've had a blast the few times I've participated."}
{"text":"Only if I could give zero star...   Drink is never consistent here, bubbles are either too soft or hard like it's been sitting for too long  They didn't wash the tool properly, my bubble tea tasted like cleaning chemical (bleach or some sort), I had to dump out the drink  Will not go back"}
{"text":"Haven't been to toronto in a while, but so glad they opened this location! Love this chatime - great drinks, very clean, and nice place to chill. Definitely will come back every time I visit."}
{"text":"I love my Chatime but I found that my experience yesterday disappointing. I went at an off peak time, with only a handful of customers in front of me and it took a very long time to get my drink. After ordering, it took more than 10 minutes to get my drink. Compared to other stores (Markham, Yonge and Finch, Downtown on Dundas, and the one right beside the Bata shoe museum on Bloor) with a similar queue of customers, this was a long wait. They definitely have not reached full efficiency yet. My drink was the red bean green tea matcha smoothie and I found that it wasn't thick enough for my liking. Hopefully, they will work out the links since this is a convenient location."}
{"text":"This is my first time come to this chatime. I love the milk tea from chatime. After this Bad attitude!!! Bad experience!!! I will Never come to this chatime again!!! They even did not clean the cup when they hand it to you! I'm asking for a bag, but what a bad look that she gives to me. OMG. I packed  the 4 cups tea by myself."}
{"text":"This place is brutal. Showed up here on the evening of April 9 to meet a few friends. We ordered three drinks, and it took them over 10 minutes to tell us that they ran out of tapioca. When the drinks were finally prepared, they didn't seal the tops properly and two of the drinks spilled all over us.  After making our way home, all three of us got severe food poisoning. It wasn't anything we ate beforehand; we met at the Chatime separately coming from different dinners. Emailed the Chatime folks, and they were super defensive and insisted that it wasn't their drinks. Overall, the communication was poor and they didn't even try to fix things. Very much a \"you're sick, your problem\" mentality. Disgusting."}
{"text":"We went here with friends like multiple days in a row since it was convenient closer by.  I like that they have so many options and flavors! I got a peach green tea w bubbles no ice.  Next Day I got grapefruit with aloe!"}
{"text":"I don't always have bubble tea, but when I do I have Chatime. This was my first visit to the willowdale location.   I had the mango green tea with pearls.   The pearls were fresh and the tea wasn't too syrupy. Just how I like it.   Like others have commented, this place is pretty clean.  And despite what other people have said, the wait wasn't too long.   I think I waited under five minutes.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good bubble tea and a place to hang out.  I will be coming back next time I'm in the mood for some bubble tea."}
{"text":"If you are a bubble tea enthusiast you will love Chatime.   Their menu is extensive and has as much variety as you would want in a bubble tea place. They have a TV screen showing their top 10 bubble teas. It really helps cut down on the options because there are so many things to choose from.  I had the grass jelly roasted milk tea and it was really tasty. The staff is quick and helpful. The store is clean and nicely lit. Lots of students come here to study. They also have those little Asian cookies.  I'd recommend Chatime for sure!"}
{"text":"Ok tea, Ok time.  I like how they are expanding fast within Toronto. The quality of the tea here is just A-OK compared to other stores. Sometimes I feel like the tea is water down a lot and lacks flavour a bit.   The store is also a bit hidden away in the plaza but there are signs everywhere within the plaza to tell you where it is.   The reason I come here often is because of the free one topping deal when you check into this Chatime. It works every time I go. Got to get that free grass jelly so make sure to check in!"}
{"text":"First time getting my usual at this location. I typically order the Honey Jasmine Milk Tea with Pudding, no ice and less honey. This has to be the worst Chatime in the GTA. The tea flavour is so weak I would have thought I had ordered milk water. Less honey does not mean no honey, I am beyond disappointed..."}
{"text":"I came at an off peak time (few days after grand opening) and there's still a considerable wait. 10min to place the order and was told to return in 20min for the drink (glad they gave me a heads up about that). I don't like to waste time waiting so probably won't be back any time soon (at least till the crowd does down and the staff get quicker).  Got the taro milk tea (30% sweetness). It was not sweet at all, and tasted weird actually. I thought it was slightly powdery, although my wife  who also tasted it didn't agree (she did also think that it was weird though). The funny thing was that the drink she got (mango juice) was also 30% sugar, but was really sweet.  *** The grand opening special (until 4/9) is a free regular drink (one of 3 options) with the purchase of another drink. ***"}
{"text":"I pop by here pretty often since I live walking distance away, but the service has always been hit or miss. Some days my order comes out perfect, other days they mess it up and have to redo it. Some days when they're extremely busy they don't want to deal with my complicated mass order, so they just say they don't do this or don't have that. I understand, it's a small place and for some reason they get a huge influx of customers that overwhelms them every now and then so ... I'll let it slide.  BUT. Opening a chatime in this plaza (while it's awesome for me), is pretty terrible overall. The plaza is swarmed with a lot of food options so it's always crowded, parking is atrocious there and the chatime here is quite small in comparison to others - on par with the Mississauga location I think, or possibly smaller.  In conclusion - I'm still really happy it's here so I can get my bubble tea fix without having to drive. Thanks for coming to my neighbourhood chatime! Please work on getting my orders right more often and I'll happily bump up my review!"}
{"text":"The usual chatime. This location is at the side of the Plaza and can get quite crowded due to its narrow size. The seats are much closer and crowded. Other than that it is like all other chatime franchise and tastes great. Staff member are friendly and atmosphere is the usual and casual."}
{"text":"Great selection of tea and very helpful staff. This shop has convenient parking, comfy seating, and very clean washrooms. My wife and I were served promptly--Chatime is the only bubble to place we trust."}
{"text":"My favourite chatime place in all other places. They finish your drink within a reasonable amount of time, and deserts always taste fresh. Their raspberry macaroons are exceptionally good, could say that it's my favourite! Sadly this is the only chatime place where I have seen raspberry macaroons. I come here all the time to chill with my friends, and the staff are always welcoming and kind."}
{"text":"This ChaTime location is the one closest to my house but not the best. In terms of quality, bubble tea is decent, service is efficient; but I've had better at other locations. This ChaTime is also sort of cramped in space - very narrow and limited seating area. Did some homework here with a friend the other day when it wasn't busy. But, I wasn't feeling the music playlist they had going. Don't mean to hate but the loud rap/club music doesn't match the bubble tea cafe vibe... :p Something more mellow, pls!"}
{"text":"Happy to know that there's a Cha Time close to my new area now. Although this location doesn't compare to the Yonge and Finch location but the service was still quick and efficient. The only thing is that the tea flavour wasn't as good as usual. I ordered the Roasted Grass Jelly Tea, my usual fave and it didn't serve up to the same quality. I think I may end up driving an extra 5 mins to get my bubble tea fix at the Yonge/Finch location."}
{"text":"They need to make their ordering process easier. Speaking slowly with a Canadian English accent doesn't make for a speedy order.  Why not use an app and have patrons order (hmm may be even order online to reduce the congestion), prepay, and just pick up.   This way, this eliminates the communication challenges; thus, allowing their staff to concentrate on the food preparation and not for all parties straining for what is said."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. This location is friendly. The manager is really nice and has amazing customer service."}
{"text":"The \"red\" pocket giveaway is probably the worst offer I've seen in a while. You get a coupon (buy one get one $.88 regular sized drink) and another coupon for $5 off for the Tian Bao travel store (what???).   The drinks here also didn't taste as good as other cha time locations in Markham or even Mississauga. The pearls were overcooked and there was just too much milk in my drink.   It also seems to be a place where kids like to study these days? So it'll be hard finding a table here in the evenings."}
{"text":"Clean bathrooms and delicious drinks. I appreciated that I could get my drink without any sugar as the regular bubble tea places are usually too sweet. Lines were long during the opening BOGO, but chatimes usually have long lines even without the promo! I'll be back especially to eat at the neighboring places."}
{"text":"I know I abuse the term 'hell on earth' a lot but this is literally it.  I'm not happy about giving another chatime a 1 star, since they're my bae. Chatime is amazing, ok? But this branch does not reflect it. It's so spotty. I was surprised to see a check in offer for a free topping though!   Parking is ridiculous.. I seriously saw a lambo stalled on the side as the guy waited for his gf to rush back with the drinks.. this was all happening as a mom-van was trying so hard to back out and held up approx 6 cars behind her for about 7 min.. me, being one the cars stuck behind this mess was already frustrated. I had to park upstairs, where it literally reminds me of my old days of playing grand theft auto. So empty but also a bit sketch.   I've been here before and the waits are bad, but not horrible. The store this time was a complete mess. I walked in and saw people lined up in different areas while the worker was screeching at everyone to line up against the side of the wall. Not the store's fault, but it was complete havoc. Crazy asians.. how do you not know how to follow a line? After being ambushed by two crazies, I finally got into the line. I lined up for approximately 3 minutes before glancing at the waiting area and saw how long it took to even collect your drink. So many people and such a little store is a problem, especially with not a lot of chatimes in this area. I was done at that point and decided to just leave.  Boo.. I really wanted chatime that day."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends after work. Luckily, we were able to get a table. It's still a fairly new Chatime location in a busy week at the corner of Leslie and Finch. You'll need to do some digging as it's located near the back of the plaza. It wasn't busy coming here. Like many of their chatime's, this one isn't too big either with very limited seating area. This one surprisingly sells a lot of macaroons here. You can't go wrong with Chatime so it's a great choice to get bubble tea here with their extensive drink menu. Perhaps, this one isn't as busy here compared to the other ones located in very busy high traffic areas. Don't forget to always tap your Vicinity card to collect those points for free drinks and other perks!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 drinks using Uber eats. Even though it took an hour for them to deliver to us, I was pretty satisfied with the discounts that I got. I loved the Wintermelon Sea Salt Crema. I have been to this location many times. Overall, I love their service and their drinks."}
{"text":"I normally like Chatime, but my most recent visit here was rather disappointing.  I got a regular Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jelly and there was more or less no tea flavour -- the drink was very watered down... I'm not sure if they were skimping on the tea -- I was watching an employee make someone's drink since I was sitting facing the cash register and they were just randomly mixing the regular milk tea, roasted milk tea and the green teas together in the cup because the overhead tea canisters seemed to be almost out of tea...  I would rather go to Chatime Scarborough instead even though the wait times there are pretty bad."}
{"text":"Dropped I'm to pick up their signature roster milk tea after dinner. The service was super fast, two people ahead of me, waited 3 minutes and as I was deciding if I wanted less ice and sugar, they already started my drink, as soon as I said less sugar,less ice, all the ingredients are thrown into the mixer, and made. I think I waited 10 seconds for the machine to seal my drink and then it was ready. Super fast and efficient service. Definitely my favourite Chatime location."}
{"text":"Phoned in with a large order and they handled it without any issue, except they made a minor mistake with taking the order for one of the drinks. Other than that, service was pleasant and nothing special. Quality of the drinks is as you'd expect from Chatime more widely (in other words, quite decent and definitely above-average as far as bubble tea places go). Like most Chatime locations, it is relatively small with very limited seating avaiable. Plaza is also a disaster at night and especially on weekends; parking situation is absolutely horrendous."}
{"text":"Nothing special here compared to any other Chatime location. This one does always have macaroons to buy."}
{"text":"I found a piece of broken plastic in my drink.  I bought their Palm-egranate Passion summer drink with tapioca. When I finished the drink, I noticed that there was still a tapioca piece left in the cup. Upon closer inspection, it was actually a broken piece of black plastic. I'm guessing it could have been a piece of the blender that broke off when they were making the drink.   At first, I didn't notice it since it was black and it easily looked like a broken/flattened piece of tapioca and it was easy to miss. I suppose I could have performed a close inspection of my drink when I got it, but I don't think most people do that as they normally don't expect pieces of plastic to be in it. Luckily for me, this piece of plastic couldn't fit through my straw so I wouldn't have been able to swallow it.  It obviously wasn't intentional, but employees should be more careful next time when preparing drinks. I'm pretty disappointed as I always have a positive experience at Chatime and enjoy their. It's too bad that something like this happened!"}
{"text":"This location feels a bit small and dimly lit. Service wasn't exactly the friendliest. It felt very robotic. They have pretty small tables, but you can take up multiple wall tables if you have a huge group. Not sure if I would go back. It's awkwardly placed behind the plaza away from other establishments. There is a supermarket and a restaurant next door, but I would feel a lot more comfortable if I could access it more easily.   I got the #1, but it tasted a bit watered down here despite me not getting any ice."}
{"text":"I was craving a fix for some bbt and a pick me up to get the day started. Stumbled upon this chatime which was in the same plaza as the grocery store. The store was empty so the service was quick. I ordered a regular roasted milk tea with tapioca 30% sugar and ice. Although the service was fast, I noticed that the way he made the bbt was extremely sloppy. The liquid jus overflowed everywhere and had not care. Yes he wiped down the drink but the drink was so poorly made with zero care. I normally don't come to this location and only visit the Dundas and bay location but this experience does not make me want to come back"}
{"text":"Never again.  The ordering process and the queue control SUCKS.  People butting in line \"regulars\" (lots of serious posers with attitude) who are not used to being told how to behave.  Counter staff who look as though they're in a trance.  And now the worst part:  the product sucks.  WATERY.  No depth, no flavor.  Never again.  Chatime, I am done with you.  You suck."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. It's nestled away in the corner of the plaza, so I almost walked past it the first time. But I'm really glad that they finally opened a Chatime in this area! Great location (the food in general in this plaza is phenomenal), friendly service, and the drink quality is consistently delicious. My favourite is the hot roasted milk tea with grass jelly, or the mango qq. Never pass this plaza without grabbing a Chatime."}
{"text":"Superrrrrr slow! Last night of BOGO FREE opening special promo! They can't handle volume at all! They say 5-10 mins but really it's more like at least 20-30 mins! With the BOGO promo lineup itself took abt 30 mins so in and out total of maybe 45 mins? The girl at the counter can't seem to even take a simple order, after repeating my requesting for pudding on top of my pearl bbtea, she even repeated it verifying pearls and pudding? After I paid I noticed she didn't punch it in and then she had to ring it up again... Man, how much training does it take to ring in bbtea?!?"}
{"text":"I'm based out of NYC, but when I'm in Toronto, I always come by here. (I love to grab lunch or dinner at one of the many restaurants in the plaza, and grab an amazing drink on my way in or out.)  Location is incredibly clean. Parking is very convenient (lots of spots in the front and back of the plaza, along with a parking garage). The staff are very friendly and helpful. I always find the quality of the drinks done consistently well. My personal favourites are the hot roasted milk tea with grass jelly or the mango qq.   I never come by this plaza without dropping by Chatime."}
{"text":"Came back after the mad rush from the grand opening.  The service speed is still lacking compared to the Markham and Richmond hill locations.  The taste is also not as strong/ rich as compared to sister stores.  Maybe the staff is still learning the recipes may try one more time and hope things change for the better"}
{"text":"I usually avoid most BBT places during prime time so I never have any issue with long wait or lines.   Arriving at Chatime on a weekday around 3:30 pm. The parking lot was half full. There were a few people waiting around in a really small space with narrow alley. I really not sure where the line and who were waiting to order or pick up. It did feel a little disorganized.  My usual Roasted Milk Tea with Grass Jello was made well. Just like all other ones I ordered from other Chatime's location.  I cannot imagine how unpleasant it would be during peak hour. I would definitely avoid."}
{"text":"Careless lady server did not add points to my card, and lied to me that the points have been added. This happened twice. Sometimes little things turn customers away.  I find a number of employees at Chatime in various locations pretty rude to their customers. My understanding is that they're stressed as it gets busy. Bbtea tastes alright!"}
