{"text":"Milestones, you've impressed me. On a busy Saturday night, you accommodated our last minute work reservation for 20 people and hustled like crazy to take our orders and bring our food quickly so we could make it on time to an evening event we were throwing. Good food and friendly service made it a great (albiet brief!) experience."}
{"text":"Definitely \"meh\". We went at a very non-busy time of day and found the service really indifferent and slow. There's nobody at the host station so the waiting starts there, continuing with slow food arrival. Nobody comes to re-fill water/drinks. They \"ran out\" of certain items within a half hour of their opening time. Chicken and waffles brunch item was disappointing - sits on a soggy bed of spinach, poached egg is cooked to hard-boiled, chicken is tough. The waffle was tasty but the rest of the dish was unfortunately a fail. Definitely not one of the better options for Sunday brunch, which is a shame because I have had some good meals there. Not sure if management or something else has changed internally but it's not a change for the better."}
{"text":"I came here with the group to celebrate a birthday. The Winterberry drink was fabulous. I ordered a stacked burger and fries. Fries came out hot, crispy and salty which was perfect. The burger was actually quite dry and lacked flavor. We haven't come here in a while, noticed up price increase in a lot of the dishes we used to love. It was good for what it was, but I'd rather take the $30 we spent on two burgers and have something a little better."}
{"text":"I've dined here a couple times and the service, food and atmosphere has always met or exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Wewere looking for a place to eat, and could not decide where to go.This restaurant's inviting image from the outside won us over. We were greeted in a very pleasant manner and asked where would we like to sit. The place is huge, nicely decorated and at that time it was not too busy at all. The waiter showed up with a trainee to take our orders, and the fun has begun. He was not very helpful with suggesting an entr√©e, it seemed because he was not too aware of the menu. Once we made up our mind, the food arrived almost too fast, which kind of made us wonder... One of the orders was Thai noodles and I found something like eggshells in it. I told the waiter, and he asked \" did you find it in your food?\" \" Yes', I said, \" I did not bring it my purse\". He said he will inform the kitchen, but I do not remember any apologies. Nobody came back to talk to us about that at all. The service was very slow after that. When done, the waiter came and removed the empty plates, not asking if we want dessert , or coffee, tea, etc. We were hoping he will come back. Never did. Instead, another waiter( whom we noticed was waiting at other tables next to ours) came and asked if we need anything. At that point, we asked for the bill. And, again, the place was not busy, there was no excuse for such a slow service, and definitely there is no excuse for the waiter's behavior."}
{"text":"Sat upstairs for a business lunch meeting. Staff were friendly and attentive however they over do the 'is everything going ok' pitch. Staffers, please take notice to your patrons and lunch meeting dynamics. Meal was reasonably ok. My Salmon was alright but the veggies were soggy and seemed to have been sitting in a heat tray for quite some time -definitely not fresh.   Other than that, an ok place to visit."}
{"text":"I love Milestones. This is my favourite chain restaurant, and I'd pick it any day over the other few similar restaurants.  I have a few go-to dishes, especially love the California spring salad with some chicken on top. I recently went on a Wednesday on 'Date Night', and I thought for $50, the meal was a steal (one appetizer, two entrees and one dessert). I ordered the scallops, and my date had the steak. All of the food was cooked just perfectly with a lot of flavour. They even have a small gluten free menu now with a g-free hamburger selecition.  The Southcentre and Market Mall locations definitely keep up Milestone's reputation, however the downtown location always seems too busy, understaffed, and as other people have mentioned, the food quality isn't on par."}
{"text":"I have not been to a milestone for a while and there must be a reason.  A new one opened up recently at yonge and #7, it is nicely decorated and looks welcoming.  Food: I ordered the 20oz prime rib, the meat is tender but lacks flavours.  I don't expect the prime rib to be sizzling hot but it is not even lukewarm.  The suppose to be medium well top sirloin is fully well done, not a trace of pinkness.  The kids meal is average with no surprises.  Service: Staff are friendly but not detail oriented, more likely a training issue. The waitress forgot the kid's orange juice and only noticed it when asked.  This is not a steak house but I still expect someone came by to ask if it's ok, but never happened.  At the end of my dinner, they took away my empty water glass and never came back.  Although we stated that there is peanut allergy at the table, they still bring the cookie with the dessert without letting us know what kind it is.  Overall this is not a great dining experience and i will unlikely return.  I should have read the reviews from fellow yelpster and went somewhere else."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this milestones a number of times over the years. With varying service and food quality. Today however, was the absolute best of everything! We had an amazing server, Stephen, (who was awesome!) and I can honestly say the best meal I have had at a restaurant in my life. We started with the California spring salads and fish tacos, then my husband had the basil thai pasta while I had the 8 oz prime rib with mashed potatoes. Finished off with four layer chocolate cake and the white italian cheesecake. Let me be clear, IT WAS AMAZING THE WAY THROUGH!! If this new menu at milestones stays we will definitely be going back for more!!!!!"}
{"text":"You know you are in for a good night when it starts off by waiting 10 minutes at the door for the seater greater and then have to ask a server if anyone would like to seat us. When they did seat us it was in a remote area with dim lighting. We had to use the flashlight on our phones to read the menu. I ordered a simple Steak Frites medium well - and surprise surprise it came bloody !! The only good thing was that the manger came over personally and apologized and gave a glass of wine to shut me up but even with the new order, it was pretty tasteless.  Service was mediocre at best too. Definitely not returning to this location and brand."}
{"text":"RACIST MANAGER ! The manager at this restaurant called me a \"nig$er\" and stated that \"he doesn't serve our type here, go to Jack Astors\"... He claimed to be the general manager(fat bald guy with glasses) .... There were cigarette butts all over the patio floor, crack in my pint glass, and a chunk of something on my cutlery. Not to mention it took over an hour to get food to the table... DO NOT EAT HERE...."}
{"text":"I visited Milestones with a friend a couple of weeks ago. The experience was not memorable, hence the delayed review.  We opted for no appetizers.  I ordered the apple beet salad that comes with chicken fingers. It was a good sized salad with lots of mixed greens however the apple slices were so thin and sparse the flavour was lost. The same issue with the small cubes of beets. The chicken fingers were also small, and there was only three of them.  For almost $20 there wasn't much value and I would not recommend. OK service."}
{"text":"I never leave a review on Yelp but I just had to spread the word on here. My friend and I ordered garlic bread and noticed that it was impossible to cut through. We both took a bite out of it and realized it had been MICROWAVED. You know that texture I'm talking. It wasn't fresh at all. And immediately after I started having stomach pains. That's what we get for going to crappy old Milestones. Never again."}
{"text":"The food at milestones has gone way downhill... Over priced, and low quality.  The staff were ok, but everything else was below average"}
{"text":"Not bad...nice place to have a few drinks with friends. The food is OK, but not great. Recommend when you're looking for something quick to eat. They also have a take out counter"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here a few years ago to celebrate our anniversary and were greatly disappointed. Food was plated beautifully and with finnesse but that's about it... Food is extremely over priced for such small servings and the service was okay... A bit sluggish. I asked for my steak medium rare and it was medium well bordering well done. Haven't gone back as we know other locations with better food at lower prices."}
{"text":"It has taken well over half an hour for our orders of basic burger and Benedict. The waitress has been nice and courteous but seems the the kitchen is not up to par. It's a Sunday lunch and the place is not even busy. Very disappointed and will probably not come back again."}
{"text":"Awful!!!!! Terrible service!  Very slow, takes forever for the food to come out even when there's barely anyone in the restaurant.  Inconsistent meals when ordering as a group.  No dessert menu.  When you tell the manager about the issues, she responds with \"yah the kitchen's been kinda slow lately\".  Came here a few weeks ago for a work lunch, not my choice.  Felt very sick all afternoon.  Came here again today for a work lunch, should have declined, and still the same issues, nothing improved since the last complaints were voiced.  My cheesecake was served on a broken dish today.  Someone shut this dump down."}
{"text":"We came here three times strictly because of the 25x scene point deal and the fact that we live across the street. All three times the service was horrible- nobody greeted us for at least 10 mins, our appetizers came before our drinks and water, the waitstaff is slow, inattentive and forgetful. The food is okay but over priced . For a similar menu and price, JOEY is far superior."}
{"text":"Food was good(burger, salad, dessert). Service was not. Came on a Thursday night around 9:30, not busy but there was a Christmas party going on. After we put our order in never saw our waitress again. Had to ask two different people to get her then ended up ordering with someone else. Very annoyed with the lack of service from the ONE waitress however the manager made it right with a voucher and coupons. But still may not return as I found it to be expensive ($18 for a burger, really!?!)"}
{"text":"Two stars I feel is being generous and it's being given because the waiting staff was good.  The starters we chose were the goat cheese platter, it was tasty and met our expectations.  The spinach artichoke dip was putrid.  It reminded us is knorr soup mix in watery sour cream ,I would Not order this again.  When it came to the mains they were out of prime rib so that eliminated the prime rib and sliders.  Going around the table, the fries with the hamburger were cold, the vegetarian burgers were tasteless,the Mediterranean chicken was average, there was a lack of dressing on the greens and the chicken breast was quite small. We skipped dessert as we had eaten enough mediocre food.  Would I return, An emphatic NO, would I recommend this eatery to anyone again a NO.  Look up and down Yonge st in this area there are much better choices available."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of friends. Service was quite fast despite it being a Friday night. Our waiter was also very friendly and quick. Food arrived in about 10 minutes after ordering our drinks.   The table next to us was celebrating a birthday. I overheard the waiter telling them that entree and a  piece of cake is free for the birthday girl. Seems like a pretty good freebie.  They have a bunch of specials throughout the week. Options on the menu can be limited compared to other chains. Food is also on the pricier side, but then again, you are paying for the atmosphere. Prices for drinks are reasonable.   Overall not a bad place to eat in the entertainment district, but  will probably try out other places before coming back again."}
{"text":"I had a really nice time here last night. Cody was a very nice waiter & Cedrick was a friendly and accommodating host. The food was tasty but expensive. The Urban Gimlet was slightly under poured, but it tasted fantastic. The food took quite a while to arrive, but was worth the wait.  Try the Butternut Squash Ravioli or the Grilled Chicken Asiago."}
{"text":"Food was just ok with that price. I usually don't drink, but I ordered caesar last time with friends there. It was so weak, i could say i didn't taste any alcohol. I guess that's how they make money?"}
{"text":"Food: C Service: A- Food presentation: C Atmosphere: C Prices: C+ Recommended?:  only if you can't find anything else within the 10km radius of this place.  I was here for a get together with a bunch of old buddies and this place didn't fail to disappoint. Everything from the decor to the food is pretty much average or below average. Bottom line, not much to say about this place except to add that, whatever you do, stay away from the steaks! Mine was waaaaaay overcooked and under seasoned. (I have to admit that service isn't bad though... but who cares if the food isn't any good?)"}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere. The food was just okay - I do not recommend the veggie burger. It was very obvious it came from a box. The patty tasted like something I could have heated up at home. I expect more from a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"The WORST dining experience ever!! I went to this place twice in the last two months and both time I had such a bad experience, I almost did not want to tip!  I went once on a Sunday afternoon and once on a late Saturday night. Both times, we waited a long time until someone came to seat us,  The place is SO DIM, the Lighting is VERY POOR and the whole place looks DEPRESSING.  Both times, our waitress seemed too busy and we had to put our order with another waitress. The second time around, she got us the check then we wait ten minutes and she NEVER CAME so I had to get up and find another waitress to process our bill.  I got the steak medium well: It was very poorly seasoned! It was HORRIBLE! WORST steak I had in my life!  Also, Milestones is way too overpriced for what it offers! At this point, even Jack Astors may be more reasonable for what it offers!  Walking out the waitress dropped a KNIFE on my leg and didn't even apologize to me!  Never again to Milestones. Nope, not this location."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice with my friends where I had one mediocre and one pretty good meal. My mediocre meal was one where I found myself choosing something from a brunch menu despite it being a weekday. To be honest, I didn't really like any of the selections but opted for something I thought I would enjoy the most. Turns out I still didn't enjoy it very much. After that, I didn't think I'd be returning again but it was my best friend who convinced me that their burgers are great. I decided to give them another try and boy was I glad I did. I got the California burger with fries which were quite delicious. The burger itself was big, patty was juicy, and ingredients were fresh. Although pricey at $17, I haven't had a burger I liked so much in a long while.   That being said, Milestones is kind of like a burger joint for me instead of an actual restaurant because I will most likely only go for their burger."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was the best part of this particular dining experience. Friend and I wanted a lively, casual but slightly upscale place to grab dinner. This was exactly that.  FOOD: Not great.  Shared two apps...breaded calamari (soggy breading) and popcorn shrimp (too salty, and paired with bleh sauce). Cajun Shrimp Creole had a sauce that was comically too salty, was going to send it back, but servers seemed very busy, and I felt non-confrontational, so just picked my way through it. Friend had the Portobello Mushroom Chicken and ate it without complaint (nor with compliment though).  SERVICE: Why is it so difficult to get good service? Smile and be friendly. Take the order correctly. Deliver the order. Check the order. Bring the Bill. Unfortunately these base expectations not met.  With so many restaurants around, I think it's good to be picky!"}
{"text":"Awful food...slow service...cold waiters.. I was served stale sauce with the fish I ordered...when I complained, our waiter Dave told us \"so what you want me to do with it?\" Well I replied thanks! At least inform your cook that it's stale! He just gave me a cold face and said...ok sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch in-between shopping yesterday for the first time in several years.  Restaurant wasn't too busy was nice as it was easy to converse with my daughter.  Ordered the prime rib sliders and coconut calamari.  Both were delish!  My daughter had the traditional eggs benny and said it was good too.  They have just brought in a lovely new red cabby that I highly recommend... Tom Gore.  Perfect accompaniment with my meal.  I even headed over to Liquor Depot to see if they carried it.  They were out of stock but ordered in a case!    The only complaint was when trying to clear the tab, their debit machine doesn't accept BMO debit cards.  Time to upgrade!  Otherwise, a pleasant experience all in all.  Oh, and maybe just maybe don't be so chintzy on the calamari serving and the dipping sauce."}
{"text":"It seems that people have mixed reviews of Milestones. I've been there a few times, and each time has been a positive experience for me. The vibe is chic and modern, with leather booths, dark woods, and cool decorations inside, and a great big patio outside.   I went to Milestone's for lunch the other day with a bunch of friends, and I have to give credit to our server, who was exceptional (compared to your typical restaurant in Calgary, where the service is generally lacking).  The server thought ahead and kept everything on separate bills, was very accommodating to a few of my friends' requests to modify menu items, and never let us run out of liquids.  I was there just for the liquids as I wasn't very hungry, so I really appreciated it! My lady ordered a \"girlie salad\" - strawberries, goat cheese, candied pecans, and chicken - and she really liked it.  It was big enough to be satisfying, it was fresh, and had lots of strawberries and tons of chicken.  Another diner at my table selected a marinara pasta which looked quite good, and the option to upgrade your side to yam fries when ordering a sandwich was a big hit amongst my other friends.  They were a big on the soggy side for me, but it could have been just a bad batch.   All in all, yet another positive experience at Milestones!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for their Wednesday \"date night\" 2-for-$50 special. It includes an appetizer, two entrees and dessert. The appetizer and dessert are shared. Our guests were two friends of ours, who also did the 2-for-$50 deal.  The appetizers: The artichoke dip was flavorless. The bruschetta tasted good, but was soggy.  Main courses: The two men ordered steaks, both medium-rare. The steaks arrived *very* rare. Don't know about the ladies' meals, beyond an \"It's OK\" from each of them.  Dessert: My wife and I had ice cream. Don't recall what the other couple had. But really....it's dessert. It's tough to screw up dessert.  Verdict: The service was good, but it didn't offset the very ordinary food."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about this place, really.  The food was pretty good, not great.  the waitress was definitely helpful, but maybe a bit too \"in your face\" for my liking.  Not quite as genuine as I like my servers.   However, the two things we wanted to order, a) the prime rib for the meat eater, and b) the squash ravioli for the veggie - were both no dice as they were out.  So that was kind of smelly.   I do appreciate the way the restaurant is laid out though.  the booths are rather private, which is solid, especially when your conversation drifts to rather unpleasant topics that are usually left for after dinner parties, and even then, the more crude of stand up routines."}
{"text":"Watered down Caesar  Manhatten was made incorrectly.  Worst service . Waiter took forever to take our orders and the food took over an hour even though the Restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"Was ok... Selection was kinda weak but the food was good. For the price IMHO not total worth it. The service was good."}
{"text":"Great sized portions with amazing selection. Salad was delicious and Thai dish was spectacular"}
{"text":"First time here in many years. Was a good place to meet with friends when in school. The atmosphere here is casual yet energetic. I like that there are tv's here that show live sports"}
{"text":"What?? Their Ultimate Bellinis are no more!!! Say it ain't so!! Tears .. And more tears!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is good, specially if you get a patio table outside.   Service - Don't expect anything spectacular, specially if it is busy / sunny afternoon  Drinks - Bellinis are always good, Raspberry Mojito was just right...  Food - Cali Burger, not impressed.  The burger just didn't hit the spot in any way.  The Yam Frites on the other hand were good, not the best but good...  Seafood Fettuccine, just okay.  Chocolate Ibarra Cake - good for chain restaurants... caramel and chocolate were missing the rich flavours that make this style of cake awesome."}
{"text":"Great decor and atmosphere. The service is friendly. What let this place down is the food. The serving size is average. The food itself seemed decidedly ho-hum. The mashed potatoes were far from fluffy and the prime rib could have been cooked with some more care."}
{"text":"We booked a table for Sunday brunch at 10 o'clock and found out there were sth wrong with the kitchen that they could only start to work at 10:45. No one called to noticed the customers which destroyed my whole day schedule. They should know in advance like at lease 15 before and called the customers . What kind of customer service??????  There were not enough servers. Always waive my hands for 10 minutes to get someone to help. Food are ok but not good to be honest.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch, the staff are really nice and attentive.  It took 15 minutes to try to wave down a server to take our order, then it took over 30 minutes for our dishes to come out which was quite a wait. On top of it our dishes were heavily salted. I went thru several glasses of water just to eat half of my pasta. This is my second time here, I remember I had a good experience during my first visit. I will read the reviews next time."}
{"text":"Food was great, good craft beer selection and the service was excellent.  Mary is an excellent waitress!"}
{"text":"Milestones really needs to step it up been twice recently for work and it is awful. Actually include Moxies, Boston Pizza, Eastside Marios, Canyon Creek, pickle barrel, Jack Astors, Kelseys. ughh they are all so bad I am constantly forced to go for work lunches and events. Seriously ashamed of Canadian chains restaurants.  Canadians don't understand in the US there are actually GOOD chains while we accept subpar expensive cardboard like milestones. Picture Milestones but drop the faux snobby attitude upgrade the d√©cor, take the menu throw it out and replace it with one that's about 5x as big with some actual vegetarian , vegan, gluten free, low carb, low fat, and generally customizable, options. Lower the prices, offer FRESH iced tea and homemade lemonade and lastly throw out all the food and replace it with food that tastes good. if there was California Pizza Kitchen or Cheesecake Factory in Yorkdale Milestones, Moxies and pickle barrel would probably have to close their doors or take a serious look at themselves.  If there was an Olive Garden or Carrabas at Scarborough town, East Side Mario's would just have to lie down and die.   My meal at this milestone's was so bad I sent it back and just asked for it to be taken off the bill. The one vegetarian option besides their horrible veggie burger was pasta and it was so overcooked that I had to eat it with a spoon and not a fork no joke. The sauce tasted identical to like 99c ragu. To charge more than 2 dollars for that mess is simply insulting.  Last Saturday reluctantly went to the Yorkdale location for a quick bite as my boyfriend was starving and it was the only place not full ( I wanted chipoltle!) decided just to get some apps.  Got garlic bread, bruschetta and strawberry lemonade they said was home made. The lemonade was clearly made from concentrate and added to sickly sweet strawberry syrup. The garlic bread was inedible it was covered in a chimichuri sauce, well what they call chimichuri is disgusting and it was COVERED in the stuff we couldn't eat more than two bites. The bruschetta had the same strange taste too like rotten cilantro. Everything at this place is also so so so heavy drenched in oil and butter and cheese. We both felt sick and vowed never again. BTW your only vegetarian salad is with strawberry and goat cheese, what is this a 1986 throwback?"}
{"text":"Came in was fully ignored not acknowledged servers walking past me servers on their phone...15 minutes nothing...i went to Jack Astors"}
{"text":"Maybe I just was there on an off-day... but I really didn't like Milestones. It reminded me of yet another Earls/Moxie's type restaurant. Nothing special about it. The food, I found, was mediocre at best. I wouldn't bother to try it again."}
{"text":"Milestones has a pretty standard chain offering - so although the food is okay, my question to any of you would be to explore so many of the other amazing restaurants in this area.   We chose Milestone's for a family event - and we had elder grandparents in attendance with mobility issues. Milestones was actually their choice! Not only did it take forever to order for our group of 15, we were then asked to abide by their 2 hour rule - and they wanted to rush us into the bar area to finish up dessert.   I understand that the downtown location is bound to be busy, however, I certainly can't imagine why I'd ever return for terrible service and mediocre food. There is much better to be had in the area, and we'll take our family outing elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love Milestones wherever they are. Thankfully we now have this one near the Silver City Theatres on High Tech. Before, we only had a Kelsey's in that area which was mediocre at best - convenient and filling BUT, Milestones is a cut above. It makes our \"dinner and a movie\" date night so much better. Try their Bellini cocktail."}
{"text":"Came here  for drinks with a friend tonight. We wanted a patio seat and was told it would be about 20 minutes so we took a seat at the bar in the meantime. Shortly after, our table was ready. The location is great; looking over the busy streets with the CN Tower in the back. I got 2 original bellinis  ($6.99 each) & was pleasantly surprised when the bill came and they were only $4.49 each because of Bellini Tuesday. I also got the chocolate torte; rich, smooth, and sweet, with a buttery caramel sauce. Good, but not fantastic. Service was pretty slow, though. My first drink sat empty for quite a while."}
{"text":"Meh. This place is alright. It was actually pretty busy when we went so we had to wait a few minutes for a table. It's actually surprisingly big, though!  The only thing I would say that was fantastic about this place was our waitress - she was super friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself was just -- ok. The sweet potato fries were a huge waste of money. Normally I love them. Here I didn't even eat 1/4 because they were, frankly, terrible. My beef dip was pretty good - nothing special.  Also, the fire alarm kept going off in the building -- and apparently this happens on a fairly regular basis -- not exactly the best ambiance for a meal."}
{"text":"Food tasteless and overpriced. The wait time for the meal (4.pm) was way too long. I have been at this Milestones previously & was impressed. In my estimation this Milestones has deteriorated. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"0 Stars - Rubbish.  I'm not sure why anyone would decide to put themselves through this glorified Harvey's. We went on game night to grab grub and drinks since we had guests from out of town. Yet they would play the game since they had to pay for that channel. We waited 25 minutes for our second round of drinks, just to get attitude from the Abercrombie gone wrong waitress. When I asked her \"why the Attitude?\" she got so offended that she sent over her manager as she pointed us out to all the wait staff. How dare I ask such a question?   The Manager that night was the most sarcastic person I ever met. We were better with the server that didn't like to serve. This manager was laying her chin in her hand (arm leaning on the table) and asked me \"If it made me sad that the waitress gave me bad service\". I really couldn't believe that this was happening.   After 20 minutes of listening to her mumble about nothing I realized that she had no clue how to manage nor did she really care therefore I decided to lay into her a little. I basically told her that if she was serious about addressing customers concerns she should try to not treat them like 4 year olds.   The way I figure it is that they get their business from the mall movie theatre and tourists to downtown so why would they care about local that give them regular business. I might be wrong but their service almost laugh worthy it was so bad. Like a Wayans Brother movie.   They decided to give us some \"come back for free appetizers coupons\" which was also funny because after all of that, they actually thought that we would come back? I know that free cheese sticks are hard to resist yet I would prefer to be kicked between the legs with a frozen boot before going back there."}
{"text":"The California Burger was pretty good. We also had some chicken and noodles, not quite as big as the burger but still ok. Good service and free refills for pops.  The place is huge, and you almost certainly get a table at any hour of the day.  Nothing special, but not bad. Didn't like menu, there are so many different items on it. Steaks/Asian/Noodles/Vegetarian - it's too much of a mix.  Pricey. We paid 70 dollars for 2 pops, chicken breasts, and a burger...  Huge bar area. Looked nice, but haven't tested it."}
{"text":"First we found our water had dust like things in it when you swirl the water with a straw. Then we found hair in the fries. We didn't say anything, just paid for our meals, tipped, and vowed to never come here again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, with a good atmosphere, especially for being in a mall.    Milestones has always been consistent.  I've been dining there for 25 years, since their first restaurant on English Bay in Vancouver.  Although they have gotten slightly more expensive, I would say the quality of food has even improved over time.  I usually get the Portobello Mushroom Chicken, my all-time favorite, and have never been disappointed.  I also recently ordered the Grilled Chicken Penne Asiago which was equally enjoyable."}
{"text":"I don't post much so when I do, it's either really bad or really good. In this case it's pretty terrible. Stuck up servers. Never again. Worst service ever at this place. They have a bias over which customers are tended to or not. And, a bug decided to come out from behind our booth. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Atmosphere. Great views of yonge & dundas square from the patio. The decor is modern and chic as you'd expect from this chain. Smoking permitted outside  Food. Burger with a side salad was delicious and filling. At $15 it made for a highly affordable lunch.  Service. Attentive but poor follow through."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Surly, curt, inefficient and inattentive.   Some meals were served cold. Opted not to send them back as we had a time commitment and based on the service experience deemed it not worth having to deal with our server.   Menus were filthy.  Unable to serve a bottle of wine until the table behind us was sat, ordered and received their meals?  We had been served water. Restaurant profits are huge on bottled wine and a group that frequently shares two didn't because of the manner that this restaurant is run.   With the restaurant business being as tough as it is right now it is hard to imagine that better staffing options, better training and greater attention to customer experience are not all management priorities.   Will absolutely not return."}
{"text":"Little bit long waiting for the food.  Steak is dry, and over cook.  Don't order.  Salad is the best order.  Service is satisfied, the manager take care of the over cook steak free of charge."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite milestones to go to, I love to go out for dinner every Sunday, and I have never been so happy with the service. My sister was celebrating her birthday. Our server was very knowledgable of all the food and drinks. I left happy  full and will be back"}
{"text":"I am visiting from out of town and I have been here twice in the past 2 weeks. Milestone's has always been one of my favorite Canadian restaurants and definitely one of the better restaurants in the Newmarket area. My food was amazing (I had the Italian sausage ravioli both times). Price was reasonable (although I do think it should come with a soup or salad for this price, I had to pay an extra 8 dollars for a salad, maybe I am just used to US restaurants including a salad). The service was a bit slow both times but it wasn't horrible. Overall I really enjoy Milestones and I look forward to going back next time I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Loved the waiter, very friendly, knowledgeable, overall he made the experience great. They recently changed the menu and personally I didn't love the selection but the food I did receive was really good."}
{"text":"Food quality is terrible. The most appropriate adjective that I can think of is institutional, at best. It reminds me of food you might get at a hospital cafeteria. Service was okay, but the manager spent half an hour at our table apologizing for the restaurant's decline due to inept corporate management.   We used to come here regularly the first couple years after the restaurant opened. Back then the food was tasty, creative and good value. Now it serves the type of food you might expect from a division of a very large corporation, CARA Operations, best known for providing food to the airlines.  Hey CARA, maybe it's time for a new corporate executive chef, because your current one hasn't given your kitchen staff much to work with. Poor quality ingredients,  unimaginative recipes and over-priced."}
{"text":"I have never been in this area but I have a layover, I ordered take out to my hotel room. It took an hour an a half to get here, good was cold and the worst part was the woman who delivered. She actually yelled at me because she got the room number wrong and had been knocking on the wrong door for 15minutes. I wish I could have gotten her name but after her little rant I just wanted her to leave as soon as possible! I will NEVER recommend this place and will be complaining to the front desk about that incredibly rude delivery woman and request them not to give out BP delivery menus to guests!"}
{"text":"I found Milestones while I was looking for a different restaurant and I'm glad I did. The atmosphere was modern/urban and the menu eclectic. I opted for their veggie burger. The burger itself was a standard Gardenburger-not too exciting by itself. But the topping-I had the four cheese-along with the pickle, onion and romaine lettuce made for a delicious combo. I'm in town for only two nights, but may go back tomorrow evening to try another vegetarian item from their menu."}
{"text":"It was not busy at all inside - patio was somewhat full - over 2 hours to get our food. Server brought out mayo 30 minutes before our meal came so it baked in the sun.. asked for another. Had to ask 3 times to get waters and took over 25 minutes for our drinks we ordered. I dont know if it was the server or if they were backed up in the kitchen but regardless, service and experience was terrible. If you are backed up in the kitchen at least let us know instead of us having to ask you 3-4 times when the food will be out."}
{"text":"This Milestone's location has been hit and miss for me, the first time I ate here, the experience was good - meaning food was great, the service was friendly and quick .. and it was on the patio .. beautiful night ..   Milestone's was running a promotion that combined a starter, 2 meals and a dessert - reasonably priced with great meals to choose from...the food was delicious and surprisingly one of the best steaks i have had at a restaurant iin this range  the last time i went to Milestones (like a few days ago) the service was a crawl .. it took the guy 10 years to get drinks get the food get the bill just way too long .. but that being said .. the food was great, had the steak shrimp lobster something lol and it was out of this world...  but when service is slow and just not responsive it just brings everything down a notch .."}
{"text":"Server was a bit slow and distracted.  Food was good and filling. Very busy on Saturdays so be ready for a line and slow service.   The roasted garlic app was delicious!! But beware, I couldn't go near anyone for the rest of the day haha  My pasta was good, sausage was delicious and sauce had nice flavours."}
{"text":"Service excellent. Nourriture vari√©e et d√©licieuse  :) si on retourne √† Toronto, on y retournerait !!"}
{"text":"Love the food here!  Service can be slow but well worth it and if your not satisfied with your food in someway they will usually give it to you for free. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I was wary to visit because it is a chain but I was pleasantly surprised. The service was friendly and welcoming and our dishes arrived in good time. The grilled chicken was especially delicious as it was cooked perfectly and the pasta was nicely dressed and seasoned. It's a little bit pricey but the food is much better than at any of its sister restaurants so I guess you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"This restaurant experience was terrible right from the get-go.  Upon entering, we asked the hostess if we could sit on the patio and was rudely informed that there was no space on the patio, and that the spaces we saw were in a section that was closed. We pointed at a table outside that was free, in a section that was clearly filled with people, and said \"Really? What about that one?\"  We were eventually seated on the patio, and ordered our coffees. All of our mugs were covered in spilled coffee -- fine, that happens. But my friend's mug also had lipstick on it that did not come from her lips. When she got a new mug of coffee, she wasn't given a spoon (or anything) to stir in her sugar and milk. She had to ask.  We also had to specifically ask for salt and pepper to go with our meal. I shouldn't have to chase the waitress down to ask her to bring us multiple things that are expected and necessary when eating. That's not my job, that's yours.  The food was okay, but the potatoes that came with our breakfasts had this cold salsa on it that didn't taste great and just made our potatoes cold."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere and decor but the service was average and the clean up staff slow - table next to us left as we arrived and the staff did not remove and clean the area until we were leaving. Our waiter seemed rushed and did not provide the level of service we are accustomed to. Neither my wife or I would return. Too many other choices with similar menus etc."}
{"text":"Great location, good setting and decent service. That's all you are paying for. The food is just not worth it. We went with a group of about 6 or 7 and most of them complained about how bad the food was. It was just poor quality food and didn't taste good. They have two different types of ravioli. My girlfriend got one and I got the other type. It was dry and not enough sauce. They were hard too. It felt like they jut took it out of a freezer put it in the plate and microwaved it. Someone that ordered a Caesar salad complained it was dry and not enough dressing and that it was mainly hearts and not the leaves."}
{"text":"First time @ this location and I have to say the experience is good. First, the atmosphere and the layout of the restaurant is nice, of course you shouldn't expect anything less from a grill and bar like Milestones. I was having lunch with friends and service was pretty good. The waitress did ask us politely if we wanted anything to drink and also bought us water at the same time without asking. She did do a bit more, introducing the weekend brunch to us and in a detailed manner explained what it includes and such. My friends all ordered that but I feel like if it going to cost me $20, I might as well get a main dish and I decided on the 8oz prime rib, cost $25, cooked to medium rare and let's face it prime rib is always better than a weekend brunch haha. Their alcohol menu did list out varieties of beer and wine but I was feeling Long Island ice tea. That drink was not on the menu but when I requested it, the waitress replied certainly that we can arrange for such drinks and myself thinking at the moment I hope you do if you call yourself a grill and bar restaurant. To the most important part, the prime rib is very good, it is tendered and juicy, the mash potatoes and the veggies was nice and the sauces that came with it to pour on to the dish made the entire thing enjoyable. Overall, can't really go wrong for a lunch service there and if you are in that area, especially after watching a movie and not feeling popcorn or the movie food @ VIP, can always stop by here and beside this movie theatre complex has chatime, so after the lunch or dinner, a bubble tea always a good thing haha. Final note, I don't know if the dinner service is the same, but I do hope it shouldn't be any different."}
{"text":"I had the Portobello Mushroom Chicken and it was soooooo good! I also recommend the drink that had Bailey's, Coffee, and Whipped cream put together. I had some steak off my friend's place too and it was incredibly juicy and just so good as well. I definitely want to go back."}
{"text":"Honestly the best place me & my boyfriend has been to eat. Amazing food & amazing service. Everyone was extremely kind and welcoming. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Always love the food here though it's gotten a lot tougher to eat out since I found out I'm a celiac but the staff was very helpful to make sure I didn't eat something I shouldn't.  There was a promotion going on for a lot of the mains and my absolute favourite, the Bellinis. Love the new cups they're putting the large Bellinis in, it's like a fish bowl."}
{"text":"Love going to this place.  Food is always good, servers are usually attentive and funny if you start the jokes first, and the mixed drinks are nice; particularly the bellini's  Recently found out about a couples discount for Wednesdays; going to try it very soon."}
{"text":"Our server took nearly 10 mins to greet us.  Drinks took 10 mins.  My vegan girlfriend who was celebrating her birthday requested no cheese and dressing on the side of her salad and the dish was brought with cheese and dressing on top.  We had to speak to another team member regarding the issue and to request condiments as our server was nowhere to be found.  No quality check.  No further contact from our server for the rest of the evening in fact until we were ready to leave.  Bill was brought out with an incorrect amount.  A for ambiance, B+ for food quality, F for service."}
{"text":"I had a  group staying at the Marriott and we were attempting to book some tables for dinner. First I have had great luck with Milestones in Vancouver. Not only do they accomodate groups but they give us a short menu and great service. I called this location to see if this were possible. The response was an overwhelming NO. You can come at 4:30pm or after 9pm. Can you at least reserve a few table for us? NO. Absolutely no customer service. I was so shocked by their response I called again and got the same response from another 'mgr'. Its not like I don't enjoy this place but the attitude was so rude, so adamant, so inflexible, I was personally shocked. When I'm treated well I refer people to restaraunts many many times. When I get the attitude that we don't need your business I'd be crazy to help promote them. I'd love for upper management to look into this. How can one Milestones be so acommodating and this location the extreme opposite??"}
{"text":"Good restaurant. I had a Slow-Roasted AAA Prime Rib; but for my taste it was too fatty. There was ginger in the smash potatoes and also in the dessert. I guest I am not a ginger lover. I may go back and try something different. Looks like a very nice place."}
{"text":"The service by both the hostess and server was fantastic and a very busy night was handled professionally and incredibly!  The food was amazing and the healthy options are so appreciated!  A perfect meal after a long day of work while travelling!"}
{"text":"My wife & I had dinner here on Friday August 16th and if I could do it over, I'd skip Milestones altogether. We started with an appy of calamari which was rubbery and seemed pre-packaged (could have made it at home), our waiter never once came over to see how it was. Then as our mains my wife had the surf & turf which she said was okay, but not nearly as good as she expected. I had the haddock which came with 2 large pieces, but I only finished one as it left a lot to be desired. Additionally the fries were under cooked & soggy, but again our waiter never really came around to check on our liking of the food. We obviously weren't the only people unhappy as I saw at least 2 other dishes sent back from another table. For the price of $110.00 with tip for 2 of us, I definitely could have found somewhere better to spend my money like the Saltlik or Catch both of which are located across the street from Milestones."}
{"text":"It is ok. Service was good. Beverages took forever to get to our table. We ordered an appetizer and it got there before our cocktails!  Appetizer was a goat cheese and bread, awesome! Just took forever for everything else. Noticed that Jack Astors was a lot busier than Milestone! We got our food and it was ok. Took forever. Lacking flavor, but ok. Even the servers didn't look happy. No enthusiasm!"}
{"text":"Only positive thing was the location. Had a birthday dinner at the downtown location for 16 people. 1. they said they had a private room but it was soo not private 2. the patio door was open so crazy mosquitoes were feeding on us 3. they were out of MANY ITEMS; chicken wings, sticky ribs, mango chili shrimp 4. the calamari that came was just terrible 5. lemonade took 20 minutes to come 6. The waitress brought water with soap bubbles still in the glass and had to change it 3 times.   overall everything was just terrible. Book someplace else for future birthday dinners."}
{"text":"Came here in a Tuesday night and it was quite...dead...not much tables even when the raptors are on and playing.  The food order the Mile High Chorizo Fries $11.75 and Prime Rib Sliders $ 5 each  The Fries was ok...nothing special but was definitely loaded with alot of meat and Chorizo..so if you like meat I would recommend to give it a try  As for the Sliders...the beef was tough..and almost dry...overall...nothing special..and for $5..I wouldn't order it again..."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fairly positive yelper, he is a more negative one for Jordan T:  I really dislike Milestones and for whatever reason - ppl always decide to hold group dinners here and so i end up eating here.  My main complaints are: (1) it's way too expensive for food that tastes like it was made from frozen in the back and (2) they put cilantro in everything! who likes that?  The last time I went to this Milestones they messed up my order! By the time they brought out my order (chicken curry bowl) - everyone else was done eating. I'm a slow eater to begin with so it was not a good situtaion. They also acted like nothing happened which was annoying - a free piece of cake would have won me over. My bill came to $28 - for a red curry chicken bowl and a glass of white wine - this isn't a lot of money but i think it's too much for non authentic curry and bad service   In the end I gave the review an extra star for location - i think this one was newly renovated - the inside is huge and really nice."}
{"text":"This place always seems to be busy, even on a Thursday night when we stopped in for dinner. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table, but we found a nice booth, ordered drinks and started to look over the menus. After 10 minutes, and our decisions made, the waiter re-appeared to tell us what they didn't have on the menu. A lot of trouble could have been avoided had the man told us before we made up our minds. So it took even longer to eat that night. But the food is good, even if it is over-priced. I'm particularly fond of their meatloaf. Most of their food is good and original despite the chain mentality behind it. It's worth a try, but maybe not the money....."}
{"text":"I recently went here for an early dinner with my mother in law. I have to say that I wasn't overly impressed with either the food or the service. The ambience was nice, I liked the colours and tones of the decor, big plushy booths and sleek design, and everyone in Milestones seems to be very goodlooking.   However the waiters were a bit too friendly, constantly smiling, seemed stiff, forced and unnatural... The food wasn't as good as we expected it to be, and certainly not worth the total on the bill at the end of the meal. Enjoyed the bellinis however! But we probably wont be back."}
{"text":"This is a decent Milestone's location, but I found the service slow and tired like a bicentenary sea turtle!  Okay, getting serious, the food here is decent. I've tried several dishes in the past, including their famous Artichoke and Spinach Dip, and their California Beef Burger. The portions are nicely sized and the yam frites are tasty, if not a bit flaccid for my liking! However, the butternut squash ravioli has never been right. This is true of all Milestone's but that tomato based sauce just doesn't work.  It took too long between appetizers and the main course, especially during lunch hour on a Sunday. The Bellini was well made though, so that made up for the straight-faced service.  If I'm searching for a Milestone's, I would go here again."}
{"text":"Great night out at Milestones!  Excellent roasted garlic caesar salad and the prime rib was the best I've had in a long time. We will definitely return soon to this new Markham location with their new menu items."}
{"text":"Service was ok. Food was mainly disappointing. Mile high fries - fell very short.  Mushroom soup was great and bolognese was good. Fish tacos were ok but need to be more substantial for the price. Fries were utterly disappointing - soggy and sad :(  Food court would have been a better option and far cheaper!"}
{"text":"One of my favs but i think they are slightly over priced...ie. $16+ for two tiny tuna tacos.. I'd pay that for a serving of 3 and toss the little side greens/garnish added to plate.  Stacked burger and Cali salad are my two top go to menu items."}
{"text":"We went last Wednesday evening, date night! The date night menu has many options for a great price! The portions were a good size. The food was tasty!   The service was outstanding! Our waiter was very attentive to our toddler son. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food was average for restaurant this price rank but the service really made up for it.  We were seated right away at 7pm prime time and the waitress was extremely friendly to us. Drinks and soup came right away(we didn't try the famous Bellini though).  Our food came fast too but I'd say it was more 3 stars than 4. I felt they lacked creativity and care when they prepared the food. With the same ingredients you can do a lot of things elsewhere. I also didn't feel the ingredients were very fresh (but standard freshness as Pickle Barrel etc.)."}
{"text":"Funny enough, the plates are often off putting at this particular location of Milestone's. There is always something fishy with the food and I'm not too keen of the venue so I prefer going with friends to the one on Yonge & Sheppard which seems to bring in a livelier crowd because for its bar type feel. If that is what you're looking for, check out 5095 Yonge st."}
{"text":"This is my favourite location for Milestone. I love the bar-type feel of this venue, nicely decorated with dim lights, flat screens and the latest hits playing just loud enough to be able to carry on a conversation. I find it better than the food at the 300 Borough or downtown Ottawa locations... It's too bad that the food is not consistent from location to location and even the atmosphere doesn't follow it's brand. None the less, the Belini's are awesome and bonuses you get with your Scene card are worth it, but you have to mention your card or else they won't give you your points automatically, kinna of annoying."}
{"text":"I have been to several locations before and I have always had a positive experience.  For this particular review I cannot comment about the food or staff....well kinda about the staff.  Came here on a Saturday night around 10:30 pm. The restaurant was not too busy, I would  say about half or a little over half from what I could see.  My fiance and I stood at the front waiting to be seated for close to 10 minutes and we did not see anyone come. We saw wait staff serving customers but no one approached us, somewhat understandable as that is not their job, so we left.   I have never walked out of an establishment without having spoken to someone before...guess there is always a first for everything.   I called the restaurant as I was driving away and spoke with someone who said they were the manager. They did apologize but did not offer anything to remedy the situation.   Needless to say I will not be returning to this particular location.   Since the fiance had a hankering for their signature dish I drove to the Warden and Hwy 7 location.  We are now happily sitting enjoying our evening."}
{"text":"Good food and decent service. Good spot for 12 retired ladies to meet up for dinner. Allowed separate bills. For the most part the restaurant is accessible. Lots of parking too. My fries were over-seasoned but the rest of my meal was great. I had the steak frites. Also had the beet salad which was good."}
{"text":"Big prices for small food, pretentiously presented.  Be sure to fill up on chips.   The waiter who served us got our order wrong. What was delivered was cheaper, so we ate it anyway."}
{"text":"Milestones - Market Mall  Very enjoyable - Good food - Good service  Atmosphere: Lunch time - busy but did not feel rushed - staff friendly  Food: had the California Burger - simply awesome !!!!  Very juicy.  They make a terrific margarita too. Service: the server, David H., was accommodating, and attentive to all his customer's needs, not just at my table."}
{"text":"A kindly old tramp recommended this place one afternoon as we were walking along 8th Avenue. By tramp, I mean one who rides the rails, a vagrant or hobo, if you prefer. Anyway, the unshaven and obviously distressed man was asking for change when I asked him what local dining establishment he would recommend in the area. He told us of a place a block down that would be perfect for our growing appetites. I was prepared for something else entirely, but Milestone's did the trick. It was a bit of a surprise when we entered. It's a completely pretentious place and if you think I was hard on the tramp, he was harder on us by recommending it. But all in all, it wasn't the worst place I've been to. The drinks and food are sickly overpriced for the substance provided, but it tasted good. I had the meatloaf (our friend's favourite dish) and my friend had a steak. Milestone's seems to have the fast-food efficiency thing down. It would take a real tragedy for the food to come out poorly. They understand consistency, I've noticed after trying out other locations. It will cost you and in the end it probably isn't really worth it, but it tastes good. It's always packed with clean, good-looking people circling around modern tables and furniture, trying their best to act important. If that's your scene, you've found home at Milestones. The whole...juxtaposition, for lack of a better word...is striking. A hobo recommended a high end fast-food-pretentious restaurant that can turn out decent food. They ought to pay the man to wear a sandwich-board around instead of pants as a final fit of irony."}
{"text":"This Milestone location is a far cry from its other branches within and outside of the city. Both the service and food is dissapointing. Be prepared to be told, \" I have to wait 5 min before ordering your drink\". Incredibly rude, abrasive, inattentive staff. Good was really mediocre! What happened, Milestpnes? The Dodd used to be so good."}
{"text":"First time there with my husband for dinner, waiters are busy walk around and no one greeting us for 5mins. We ordered The stylish steak with fries, the sauce is fatty, did not like it at all. Another sesame steak  is too salty, I  hardly to finish it, even though we still tip the waiter, even he did not do much services for us, we looked him chased around and so busy to notice us."}
{"text":"I stopped to have lunch here with a friend. The atmosphere and service was nice, the food on the other hand was really lacking. I had the stacked (Montreal smoked meat) sandwich and California salad. The sandwich came regular white very thick sandwich bread with a blackberry ketchup which I highly recommend getting on the side. The smoked meat was good, but not great. The salad was ok but the \"honey mustard\" dressing looked and tasted more like strawberry yogurt. My friend had the Mayan burger, which I tried, was also just ok and not all that impressive. The sweet potato fries were probably the highlight of the meal.  We also ordered the chocolate cake which the server raved about. I really wouldn't recommend it. The scoop of ice cream that came on top had 10 times more flavor than the cake itself. The caramel drizzle across the plate (the real kind, not the fake stuff most people are used to) was actually really nice though.  Overall the experience wasn't terrible but the for the price I definitely expected better."}
{"text":"Best Milestones in Toronto. Usually less busy than the Yonge/Dundas ones, and a whole lot quieter."}
{"text":"We went out to Milestones at Market Mall to have a nice family dinner and the end we all left pissed off and our night out was ruined. Me and my brother ordered Moroccan Lamb. The quinoa that came with the dish tasted horrible and stank. Never had anything taste like it. The lamb was cold and felt like came out of the fridge. We had to send them back and told the waiter to ask the chef to smell and taste the quinoa specially. My grandma hated her food and barely ate any of it. She ordered the Mushroom Chicken. The waiter came back and said the chef says the quinoa is not bad but it's not good either. Whatever that means! He offered no apologies and started making excuses and was more concerned about us making accusations that the food may have gone bad. All we were looking for was to take our feedback and make improvements and offer an apology for cold horrible tasty food. We all left in a bad mood and I'm officially boycotting all Milestones restaurant as they always have disappointed me. I'm sure there is some good food that people can enjoy but I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"The service was terrible, the food was very bad, and it smelt really bad. I wouldn't bring anyone here for a birthday or ANY Celebration really. The only caveat was the birthday treat and even that was served as more of a grunt then experience. Milestones use to be a great place to have a nice night out but on Sundays it seems to be lacking both in enthusiasm and grace.   I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU GO HERE. BUYER BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate a birthday with 20 family and friends on Saturday night, as soon as we walked in, instant regret.    When we sat down, we were told that the restaurant was undergoing renovations and was closing in two days, hence they had run out of some of the options on the menu, you think they'd have told us that prior to booking dinner for 20 people.  Their reasoning was that they didn't want to order too much stock and have extra food since they're closing in two days and that they didn't anticipate being so busy.  They were out of a lot of the main staples of a restaurant, such as lettuce, chicken wings, etc.  (Meanwhile, there's a grocery store attached to the same parking lot, but I digress.)  After much deliberating, we all found stuff on the menu that we'd enjoy so we decided to stay, which was the wrong decision.  So there was one waitress serving 20 people, not her fault.  She started taking drink orders, my wife asked for a bottle of wine, she was told that they ran out of that specific wine (there's LCBO's everywhere, wine does not go bad, why could you not have extra wine?  But again, I digress.)  So while my wife is deciding on which wine she wants now that her first choice is not available, the waitress disappears, without taking my wife's drink order.  Fast forward one hour and 15 minutes later, my wife finally gets her glass of wine.  Yes, it took an hour and 15 minutes to get a drink.  I could go on and on with the things that went wrong that night, whether it was the room temperature food that we waited on for 2 hours, or the steaks that would make hockey pucks jealous, or just the absolute horrible service and wait times.  The manager was understanding, but didn't really seem to care.  He gave us a 20% discount on the entire check, which is way less than was appropriate and comped some of the meals that were inedible, the least he could do.  All in all, by far the worst dining experience I've ever had.  Not to mention we had to wait close to 45 minutes to receive our checks.  We arrived at 8:45pm and didn't get to leave until 12:30am.  There were no apps, most people had about 2 drinks and their meal, and a comp dessert which consisted of some cheesecake which looks like a brick of parmesan.  I really hope for their sake they get their stuff together for their reopening."}
{"text":"Went on December 22, 2011 dinner.  I have been to Milestones on special occasions only and they never disappoint. Took my sister in law plus 5 ither family members there for her birthday and it was a great experience as usual. The salads perfect, dinner entres were perfectly done and the desserts where heavenly. Will always go back on my next special occasion."}
{"text":"Visiting from Cali and saw this cool look restaurant and thought we would have lunch there, the hostess sat us in the bar which was ok even though I have a 9 year old  but he's seen worst after all we from the 559 Service was hella slow, but I gotta say the food  was pretty good and pretty EXPENSIVE for lunch 3 of us ate and it was avg $20 per entree on  Unfortunately idk what it is with Canadian restaurants and NOT offering lunch menus  almost foreign to them.  Other restaurant we had lunch at was Jack Astoria and Scaddabush"}
{"text":"Always super friendly staff! Good food, fast attentive service. I've been here a ton of times and never had one bad experience and I really enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love milestones, just not at this location.  Went with my girlfriend.  Waiter went missing for 20minutes, appetizers came out undercooked and cold (calamari), our food came out separately,  salad was NOT fresh and was borderline rotting, and our waiter was a douchebag.  After we were done (we didn't finish the food), our waiter (finally) shows up and says \"It looks like you didn't enjoy your meal\", throws all the plates together really aggressively and walks away.  We paid and left. Still left a decent 15% tip because the waitress beside us was pretty nice (filled up our water) and was working her tail off to cover for him. I saw our waiter on the way out and he didn't even have the balls to look me in the eye."}
{"text":"I love the Milestone on the west coast as I am from Vancouver. Therefore, a few friends decided to get together for dinner on a Saturday night and I suggested Milestone. Patio is packed when we arrived (what else is new) but the waitress said we can have a booth right away if we don't want to wait. Decided to take the booth because we are all very hungry. Problem arises when the waitress sat us in a  Nothing to write home about but the one thing I have to mention is I ordered New York Sirloin for dinner. I don't whether it was because I was super hungry or something else, but the size of the steak is so small that I wondering whether it was the right size for $30 dollar. My friends also thought the steak was a little bit on the small size. My friends made the right decision and both ordered a burger.  The dining experience was okay but I don't know whether warrant my visit for a second time."}
{"text":"I dined at Milestones last night with some extended family for a celebratory dinner! We had a wonderful experience overall! The service was fantastic (hard to come by these days).   The food was consistent and very good. We started off with some bellinis (can't beat the $5 summer special!!!). Later on when I discovered that a fruit fly had drowned in my half-finished drink, our server happily brought me a new one.   We had the calamari and spinach dip appetizers. The calamari was average - somewhat on the rubbery side. The spinach dip was great as always.   We had everything from the portobello mushroom chicken, to various burgers, to the Cajun shrimp Diane as our main courses. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals.   Overall, best restaurant experience I have had in recent times! Thumbs up, Milestones!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Milestones before and loved the food and service every time. But this location was TERRIBLE. Our waitress never said hi to us or introduced herself, just asked \"drinks?\" Then it took over 20 minutes for us to get WATER.  Another 20 minutes after that she comes by to ask us for our food order, leaves us with our menus and empty water glasses and comes back (probably another 30 minutes past) to give us cold food. I also have always ordered the same dish from this restaurant and this location served an incredibly small portion in comparison to other locations, and no side option which I've always had before. Multiple times we had to flag a waitress down for service, and let me add - it wasn't even slightly busy at the time we went. Other tables that were there were also having to physically get up from the table to find their waitress/waiter. Never will I be back to this location!!"}
{"text":"So, when we were in Calgary recently for Stampede, and being new to town, we wondered where should we eat dinner one night.  I pulled out my iPhone and searched on Yelp, of course.  Milestones was nearby, and the reviews here on Yelp looked pretty good, plus, its Milestones...so really, how could we go wrong?  Great choice.  I had the Kobe beef sliders - perhaps inspiration from a fellow Yelper.  Yam fries were good too.  The mojito was a bit too sweet for my taste.  Oh well.  Our waitress was from Whistler of all places.  She just moved to Calgary about 4 days prior, but she seemed to fit right in, wearing the cowgirl outfit that all waitresses seem to wear at Stampede.  If I'm back in Calgary one day, I'll probably go back to Milestones. Consistent quality in food and service."}
{"text":"Quick service, lovely food and perfect portion sizes. I had the steak, cooked to perfection. My girlfriend had the gluten free burger which tasted like a regular burger. Slightly on the pricey side so minus one star. But not so pricey that you wouldn't go back because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"The challenge with chain restaurants next to major tourist attractions (e.g. Eaton Centre) is that, despite good intentions, they don't have to try that hard.  That might explain the lukewarm beer, mixed-up order and mediocre steak.  No matter how bad it gets, Milestones will pack them in.  There are better restaurants on Elm (Queen and Beaver) or Victoria (Metropolitan).  Try those instead and give this one a pass."}
{"text":"This is by far our worst restaurant experience in Richmond Hill to date. We were a group of 9 for lunch.  Food arrived 90 minutes after placing our order.  3 meals were prepared the wrong way, ignoring a coconut allergy.  No excuse for a busy kitchen. The restaurant was almost empty at 1 pm.  Complained to manager who just smiled lamely during our 1way conversation. He had no apologies, and did not offer to comp the 3 incorrect orders.  Our bill $200!! This is not a professional establishment and should be avoided unless you need a good libation. No shortage of those."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong here! :) We came in for dinner - basically for the top chef canada inspired menu, and it wasn't bad at all - yet it wasn't extraordinary!  The staff was excellent and really friendly.  Too bad the Top Chef Canada inspired menu was so limited - it only had one option for each course.  Food on the regular menu wasn't bad either - the rice was kind of weird, but besides that, it was average!"}
{"text":"Although the food was excellent, the service was terrible. We went there for Mother's Day. We made a reservation for 10 people, and they were completely unprepared, and left us (including Nana!) waiting. Then, when we got to the table, the server took our orders. 30 minutes pass, and we're all starving. He comes back - to announce that he forgot all of our orders. None of them were even STARTED - even the drinks! So, an hour into our meal, we FINALLY received our food. The girls who brought it out didn't even know what they were holding and kept on announcing the wrong dish, awkwardly circling the table and putting the wrong plates in front of people. Thank God at least one of them actually knew how to do her job. It was the worst experience, and I honestly feel like a manger should have come to apologize to us. Maybe they should focus less on hiring girls who know how to wear inappropriately tight clothes, and more on girls who know how to actually read? Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch, 3pm on July 17. The two of us ordered a Sangria, prime ribs and California salad. Food was quite good: juicy, tender meat; salad well made.  So why 3 stars?  Service was non-existent after the waitress took our orders. It was like she tried avoiding our table. Maybe we'll have better luck next time served by another waitstaff?"}
{"text":"Yes, It is safe to eat here!   I do like their Kobe beef sliders - It's probably not the best way to eat Kobe beef but it is hard not to enjoy such cute looking burgers.  The calamari steak strips are good too. But remember it is fried... so you might need to wash down the greasiness with some drinks.   My only complaint is that they tend to overcook the fish - so do stay away from it if you are one of those who are concerned about the texture of your fish.   3.5 for the food and an extra 0.5 for the service. I've never done this for any of the restaurants in Calgary but the service has always been good here. After all, service does make up a big part of your dining experience."}
{"text":"Pretty good standard franchise meal here. Had a good brunch here with friends. They have a few different eggs Benedict varieties that were all amazing!"}
{"text":"If I could give this a 3.5, I would. This is based on a collective of my overall experiences at this location.  Used to come here alot with Friends. Easy location to get to; and the food is always really well done. Used to like Milestones for their ULTIMATE BELLINI.. That however has changed since my last two visits. Small Drink and Overpriced. Used to be way better than what it is.  Food? It's always been really good, and still is. Last time I went for the Burger - Can't remember exactly what it was called, but the one with Avocado. Can't say I was blown away - but that was the choice I made.. Found the Avocado was way watery.  Yam Fries were delicious - Could do with a better sauce tho. My friend just got the Normal Fries.. Huge Portion as well.  Not a huge menu, but what from I've had.. They've done quite well.  MUST HAVE: Thai Chicken Drumettes - basically a classy way of saying a Spicy Chicken Wing. Delicious."}
{"text":"Given the current time we went it was fairly busy, although that's not to say it should take 30 minutes to get the bill.  I went here for my best friends 19th birthday party,  and all I can say is that the food was not worth it.  I live in Brampton, but because she wanted to try milestones for her birthday we decided to go all the way to Mississauga. Bare in mind that I'm not saying it's their fault the location was so far, all I'm saying is that I travelled a lengthy way to pay $50 for a meal (appetizer and main course) only to have my taste buds be completely disappointed.    I know it's supposed to be a really fancy restaurant but if I am paying that much I'd like my food to at least be decent. All in all I wouldn't recommend going to milestones if your not looking to drop a $100 just to get a decent amount of food for 2 people."}
{"text":"Best bellinis anywhere.  Great steaks and pretty much everything else on the menu is delicious.  And their service?  That's great as well.    Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Was here for a family dinner. My parents don't like 'experimental' dishes, so Milestones seemed like a good pick for the family function.   When we were seated, the server came to us promptly introducing herself. The server was extremely nice and professional; I feel like it was one of the best services I've experienced recently.  However! the food.. ah, where do I begin. It is quite common to see the quality of food drops over time when it comes to franchise restaurants, and this location is no exception. When it just opened many years ago, everything I tried tasted good enough. However, whenever I come here these days, I never am happy with their food. I end up coming back here time to time just because of easy accessibility, but I realize that it should stop now.  We ordered an app, salad and 3 main dishes. All of them were just edible except for one; a cod dish was just so awful. If you have an experience of cooking and tasting fish that's been put out to thaw from the freezer, then back to the freezer then out again repeatedly, you will know exactly the texture I am about to describe. It was rubbery outside and hard inside, definitely the texture of cod that's not fresh.   We ended up complaining to the server; she was very professional and apologetic about it.   If you have to come here for a function or for whatever the reason, just order burger or something that is REALLY HARD TO MESS UP. If possible, avoid the place - there are a lot of selections around Dundas Square."}
{"text":"Went to Milestones in Market Mall on Friday evening, and was escorted immediately to our table.  The menu is varied, and although somewhat pricey, was totally worth the quality.  We had their Mushroom soup which was excellent and peppery, which I love.  I had the Curry Chicken and my friend had the Seafood Fettucini, and we sampled a little of each other's order.  Both of us thought the food was beautifully spiced and well prepared.  Wouldn't hesitate to visit again."}
{"text":"I am a frequent diner at Milestones since it's in my neighborhood, we always come here for date night, or girls brunch, or family get togethers, etc.  It's in a great location and I think all the wait staff I've ever had has always been POLITE, FRIENDLY, AND NICE.    The food can be a hit or miss, but if you ever find your food too cold, or something is not done right, the staff always takes back the food and/or take it off your bill.  The management there (Ian is one of the managers) has always been very accomodating and nice to the customers.   However, the girl who answers the phone to take reservations is RUDE, ALWAYS IN A HURRY, AND COLD.  I just called to make a reservation for dinner, and the first thing she said to me was \"we are really full tonight actually, not sure if that's possible\".  I haven't even told her for how many people (just TWO), and what time (5:30pm, you're telling me you can't find a table for 2 at 5:30pm???)  She jumped to the conclusion and just made a bad impression before I can even get a chance to say what time and for how many people.  Shortly after, she realized it was just for 2 and at a very early dinner time, she just took my name and wanted to quickly hang up the phone.  Hello? like seriously? I haven't even asked my second question yet and she wanted to hang up.  I asked if we can get a table by the windows since it's just 2 of us at 5:30pm, then she reluctantly and with a fake voice said I'll see what we can do.  Okay fine, that's fair, but also then said bye before I said bye.  I just felt like there's no need to be so rude and rushed on the phone.  When I hung up, the entire conversation was only 2 minutes.  Seriously you need better phone manners and patience."}
{"text":"I was downtown for a convention and needed somewhere to eat an early lunch.  Of all the chain restaurants, Milestones is probably my favorite.  They've always found creative ways to accommodate my vegetarianism, and they've always had a wide range of choices for the omnivores I've dined with.  I was a little bit sad to see that Milestones most recent menu does not include my favorite dish ever- their Thai Noodle Salad.  However, in its place were a number of choices that sounded appealing.  In the end I opted for a lunch combo- $11.99 for half a sandwich, a cup of soup and a salad.  I chose the vegetarian sandwich with a grilled portabello, their seasonal potato and leek soup, and a house green salad.  Everything was delicious.  The other people I was with all enjoyed their meals- one mentioned that Milestones make their favorite burger topping, and another really enjoyed their pasta dish.  Of particular note was how fast and friendly our server was- he quickly got information from the kitchen about the potato leek soup (it's not marked vegetarian, but it is!) and despite HUGE crowds he did a great job making our sure needs were met.  If I were only judging the food and service, I would give Milestones a five out of five.  However, I deducted two stars for one of the hugest management mistakes I have ever seen.  The weather outside today was twenty below, and there was a huge conference in the Telus Convention Center (which is connected by indoor walkway to the Marriott, which is connected by hallway to Milestones).  We walked through the Marriott to the Milestones doorway, and found it locked with no signs saying if or when the restaurant would open.  Okay, we'll come back in a few minutes.  When we returned, we found someone had posted a sign saying \"Welcome to Milestones!  Please (go outside in the freezing cold and) enter through our main door on 8th Avenue\".  Okay, I added that middle stuff.  But really?  In the dead of winter you're going to CUT OFF indoor access and make guests detour around the side of the building to use the exterior doors?  We had all left our coats in the convention coat check (as we had accessed Milestones through that door before) and thus had to walk outside with no coats or jackets just to enter the restaurant.  Two thumbs down for organization and consideration."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Beyond excellent customer service and awesome Sunday brunch (egg Benedict are fantastic!)"}
{"text":"Just threw a surprise BDay party here for ~60 people...they sectioned off a perfect spot that had couches, standing tables, sitting booths...the perfect mix for an event like this and ideal for getting people to mingle. Here's the best part...the staff went the extra mile and let me set up my laptop to their big screen and even used their personal phones to get me on wifi when their in-house was down! (I had out of town relatives SKYPE in). Will definitely have another event here...especially given it's central location- I had guests from downtown T.O., Scarborough, Etobicoke, even Maple. Next time I will make sure I get musicians in there as there is a great spot for them too. Overall it was a great experience and the guests loved the food that was laid out given how quick they munched threw it...and it was convenient to have the Lablaws next door (and open late) to grab the cake and candles... If your planning an event, make sure you ask for Jenny...she was super helpful and easy to work with, not to mention she made sure I stayed under budget!"}
{"text":"Best California Salad I ever had!! I come back to Milestones each time just to have one!! They don't have much options for veg people. I have tried the Edamame, Baked goat cheese and garlic flatbread, veg burger and penne pasta..love the Edamame and the flat bread but not a great fan of the burger and pasta. They have some good choices for desserts. I have to stay this location need some TLC...I have been to some of their better locations (DT and Richmond hill). Hope they can bring this location upto mark."}
{"text":"California Salad is a must try!! Tried the sesame beans this time and they were pretty good!! Great location...great ambiance!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time there, because my husband always hated Milestone. But because we had a gift card, so we decided to give a try. Man, I regret it now so bad! We had their Wednesday date night menu. Overall bad food, bad service.  Because it was a set menu, so we only had limited choice.  For appetizer, we got the spinach and artichoke dip, dip was luke warm, (not enough microwave mins) lol. Don't think there are any artichoke inside, and the dip was so watery. Feel like they really cheap out on all the ingredients that should have went inside. The only good things were those chips with a good amount of salt LOL.  Main dish weren't any better. My salmon was totally under salted, (consider the fact I put crazy little amount of salt on my daily food). No taste at all! And the jasmine rice they claim on the menu, well I have to say, I have NEVER eaten such disgusting rice before.  The steak frites that my husband got was just as bad, steak itself was barely ok, not the freshest steak. I can taste the oldness of it lol. And I really don't understand why they would put both deep fried onion and fries in the same dish with no vege, like you are eating oil after oil. No thought has given how the dish gonna turn out.   So I thought dessert gotta be good as I Love anything sweet, yet it was disappointing again!! We got white chocolate cheesecake. It was crazy amount of sugar, almost inedible. And prob because the crazy amount of sugar, they add a large amount of salt, was just disgusting!   Not only that, our server was horrible, like he doesn't wanna be there serving us at all. No smile, never asked us how our food was, every times with food coming, he just dropped it down and left.   I am really not sure whether it was because it was a set menu and the price was cheap, or the food was just terrible there, honestly we both think we can make better food than that.  Seriously people, avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Service and food were great. Loved the company. Whitby location"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and the service has always been good and the food has always been really good. The servers go out of their way to make you happy and the food always is number 1."}
{"text":"It is very nice restaurants. One of the best Milestones I have been so far. There is ample parking space. The food is also very good. Even though wait time was a little bit long. Regardless of wait time it is worth it. This is the best burger I have ever had."}
{"text":"The absolute worst. Went with family and had a horrible experience.  Food was not cooked to order, took over 20 minutes to get steak warmed up for one diner, chicken was burnt, waiter never came around. Meal took over 2 hours. Will never go again"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday to celebrate parent's anniversary, so it was very hard finding a parking spot. Lighting was dark, you instagramers won't be able to take a nice shot of your food. We had to wait a little bit even though we made reservations. Hence the 4 stars. Other than all that I was insanely pleased with the service and food. The waiters were pleasant, more than helpful. (Ours was training a new guy). Best service I've had at a restaurant in a long time. It felt like they actually cared about us.  For dinner I had the Harissa chicken($22). It was perfectly cooked and spiced. I thoroughly enjoyed the quinoa. Not much of a fan of the type of veggies they paired it with. At the end of the night the waiter surprised all of us with a nice little dessert platter with a sparkler free of charge for our parents anniversary. We didn't even secretly ask for it! Well played milestones, well played.  Overall I would definitely go back.  I recommend making reservations ahead of time."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give 0 stars, but Yelp would not let me! Milestones has good food, but it has never, ever, in all of my trying this place(at least 6) arrived hot! It literally got to the point where we would order and SPECIFY that we wanted our food to be served hot. Even that was no guarantee. The last time, our Eggs Benedict were ice cold and we had to send them back twice. Management always says \"Oh, NO ONE ELSE HAS NEVER COMPLAINED ABOUT COLD FOOD.\" Reading these reviews, it is obvious that others have had this experience."}
{"text":"A very standard Americanized restaurant, slightly below chains like the keg but above Kelsey's and the like. Food is overall decent. The prices are what is reasonably expected in such a restaurant.  The free birthday dinners are missed, that was a great promotion. However the Monday and Wednesday promotions are a good deal.  Staff can be inconsistent. Some of them are great and professional while others seem indifferent and act as if they are too cool to be bothered.  Overall recommended for large groups, especially on Mondays with their promotion."}
{"text":"Nice grill house although I would take the chicken dishes (especially the Mediterranean chicken which comes with goat cheese !!) Nice white sangria  Great atmosphere sitting in the street looking around"}
{"text":"This was the first time at this location. The server was very nice and the the service was fast but at the expense of the food. I have a theory that anything near the airport (chains especially) will probably have a harder time attracting customers (because they are so far north) so the food may be less fresh since they probably order less or not as often. I also experience the lack of food quality with a Boston Pizza in the area.   My culinary background has taught me to be proud of a dish and to be strict about what you are serving. At home, being slack is fine because you are serving yourself but this is not acceptable at a restaurant. First, our appetizer -spinach and artichoke dip had a side of salsa fresca and sour cream. I felt like the salsa tasted different and the cilantro that was chopped ( and flat leaf parsley) had had the change to turn brown. I tasted the tomato on its own and noticed a carbonation, thus the salsa had time to ferment which is a sign that it should not be served anymore. The waiter apologized and brought me a new side of the same damn salsa still fermented. He claims they made it today, I hardly doubt it since the herbs had time to decompose a little.  Then my main - the seafood salad. Well, salad is really hard to screw up but they managed to do with style! First, since it was close to the end of the night I had nothing on my salad. It said the the salad had avocado, I received a SLICE -that had oxidized to a brownish colour, aka they cut way earlier in the day. My mesculin and salad mix was cut in gigantic chunks (iceberg) and also had bit of rotten salad. The shrimp skewers were not cooked properly one shrimp on the skewers was burnt and the other hardly touched the flame.   So, they may have been speedy but to the expense of  the customer's meal? I am picky but this was just shameful on the behalf of the restaurant. I definitely do not recommend this Milestones to anyone, unless you are willing to perhaps contract food poisoning."}
{"text":"I saw a cockroach in my veggie burger. The view from the patio is very cool. It overlooks the city. I generally like the food at Milestones but wont go back to this location! Once I see a bug in my food I can't justify ever going back."}
{"text":"Obviously this is just another major chain restaurant that most people like to be snobby about and hate. But for a big work group going out for lunch it's a great choice. The menu, like most chains (I'm looking at you, Jack Astor's) has something for everyone. All dishes are expectedly mediocre. The prices are slightly above fair, but not completely out of line. Beer prices are $7-$8 before tax/tip so they can add up on you.  Last time I got a special - the lomo beef burrito. First, it's not a burrito in any sense of the word. Much closer to a fajita with pre-sauteed meat. The beef was actually pretty good if you don't mind your food being a little sweet. The waitress offered siracha to counter the sweet and it worked pretty well. I appreciate that they didn't skimp on the cheese like most places!  You know what you're getting when you go to Milestone's. I wouldn't go there for a date, but it's solid for a large business lunch with diverse tastes and low expectations."}
{"text":"Martini was $8.00. I Love this place when ever I go to the lob laws I have to stop by for burgers and some drinks. Canada day go early and get the best seat to watch the fire works and the patio is great during summer. The lamb chops is good. my fav!"}
{"text":"Nice location, terrace is big..with fire place..you can either seat or choose to stand up. Foods & Drinks are creative...if you are by the CN tower it's few block away on John st.."}
{"text":"Good service. We ordered Steak and B√ºrger. Both were very good. We can definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"Given my past experience at milestones, I was really excited when they first introduced their new menu items... only to find myself in disappointment. I like their selection of drinks (the sweet and basic cocktails eg. Mimosas lol) and the service was okay. We ordered three apps to share and they all ended up being a disappointment for their price. I'm not a fan of these \"Asian inspired\" fusion flavours; they come off rather bland and tasted like nothing special. We ordered calamari, nachos w. spinach dip and popcorn shrimp. The location and the interior is not bad if you want to drop by for drinks before your movie or to watch a game. Otherwise, I'd save the trip given the growing population in the area (aka parking lot congestion). I'm not sure why I even gave milestones a 2 star rating because the food was honestly not worth it for how much we paid... but I feel like as a chain restaurant with a decent atmosphere and range of drinks it deserved the extra star lol (even though it's not likely that I'd go back)"}
{"text":"I went to this Milestones last week with my family. We ordered the flatbread which it was really good. The salmon i ordered was tasteless, no salt and the vegetables were blend. Service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Came to this location because I've been in Woodbridge and left with good impression. This location needs improvement. They have nice patio and they were not busy today for lunch. But the service was so slow. Food was so so, my Cajun shrimp dish was way too salty. I never had so much salt in my life. Deserts are over priced for what they are. I really like ordering appetizer calamari in places like this. Weren't lucky today. Those items were not available. As they told me they didn't receive their shipment. Basically I'm not coming back!"}
{"text":"The service was really slow on a wednesday afternoon. It took 2 hours to get our food. Exactly 2 hours. And they don't seemed to be in a rush or anything knowing thet people are waiting that long for their food. Very bad experience from this location"}
{"text":"4 stars of Prime rib is the most impressive  4 stars for Fantastic environment and service 3.5 stars for location, enjoy shopping time after/before dinner"}
{"text":"Food is delish!  Customer service is amazing each time i go.   Try their grilled chicken asiago pasta, signature milestones dip or their urban classics.  Each time i go, i wait about 2-10 minutes, depending on which day i go. Average wait time to get a table is about 3 minutes.   Everytime i go, the food has never disappointed me! I've tried their burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, pastas, chicken and steaks.  Food 4.5/5 Service 4/5"}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is really nice!  Had the chicken asiago pasta one time and had their urban chicken classic the other.  no complaints.  each time the food has been great, service great as well."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate my dad's birthday. This was my second visit to this location and my wife's third. The service was very good as the waiter was very attentive and the food was on par again. The kids were happy with their meals and my dad enjoyed his prime rib. The only criticism that I have is that the music is always on the louder side, which makes it difficult to have a normal conversation. I understand that that's what you get at a \"Bar and Grill\" type establishment. Other than that, I'll be coming back regularly."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go back. Food wasn't great at all. Service was okay. I had the veggie burger and it was really average. Two of the people I was with said the seafood salad was okay but another friend didnt enjoy her meal at all."}
{"text":"These chain-western restaurants are always bad - I mean they don't offer anything special, and it's a premium price to pay for the name of the place you're eating at. Along with Jack Astors, these restaurants provide the same bland bad burgers for 10 dollars, pasta for 15+ dollars, and don't even get me started about their drinks. This place provides hospitality for old friend get togethers that can't agree or find a cooler place on yelp, or coworker lunch that wants to keep it safe and have the conversation around the table muttering \"Oh how is your dinner?\" to be met with, \"Oh it's good I guess.\" and having the bill come to 20 dollars a person. Not worth it. Come if you ran out of willowdale selections and want to pay more for no reason."}
{"text":"We booked the private room for dinner for 15 people. The waitresses were very friendly and helpful. They did not rush us to order or pay. The food was delicious as well as the bellinis :) The room was really nice, you could decorate it for a really nice touch. The only disappointment was that there were only 3 desserts available, though the ones we chose (drunkn donuts) were really good.  I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ordered the seafood fettuccine but was quite disappointed actually. They were out of mussels ( dish comes with combination of seafood) so the lady told me they'll throw in extra shrimps. There was no taste to the sauce. I couldn't even tell it had Cajun spice. The amount of seafood was not enough. I wonder how their rest of the entrees are. I wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"Was here on Friday for lunch.   We seated ourselves.  The place was pretty empty.  The waiter came promptly with the menus and took our order for drinks.  I ordered the ahi tuna taco.  It arrived quickly and it was delicious but for $16 I think the portion could of been more.  I wasn't even full.  It was 2 small taco and 2 deep fried piece of avocado.  The taste was good but disappointed in portion size.  When we asked for the bill it took forever to come considering its not even busy.  I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food, fast service.  Had the Brunch special - Eggs Benedict with potatoes and salsa.  The bennies were tops; great execution.  I'd hold the salsa to the side next time as it made the potatoes soggy.  My wife had the Veggie Wrap with fries, she liked it.  The kids menu is a bit more expensive than that of say, Boston Pizza but the quality and quantity of food is elevated significantly.  Its funny, the kids meals were 9 bucks and the eggs benedict were 11.... My two kids, 5 and 3 could have easily shared 1 of the kids meals.    I'd go back there for brunch again and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Don't bother. I know it's handy when you're at the mall but really? I just waited 45minutes for a medium rare steak and a chicken pesto fetuccini pasta. The place is not full either. I really didn't appreciate it and the manager told us after 45min that the steak was ballooning and they couldn't get it to cook. Ballooning? Never heard that one before. Have you? I just won't bother with this place anymore. Waiting an hour for food of this quality is a waste :("}
{"text":"This place is definitely somewhere you can get a good meal.  My mushroom soup was served at perfect temperature and tasted very mushrrom-y while my friend's coconut calamari was good, too.  The chicken club I ordered was delicious and my friend assured me her burger tasted great.  And there is no beating the Decadent Duo dessert, anywhere."}
{"text":"I went here with my boyfriend and another couple before the movies on a Saturday night. I was very unhappy with the service. Our server took our order and we didn't see her until the end of the meal. We ordered appetizers and main courses, when our apps came to the table they just threw them down, not even to anyone in particular, we had to pass plates around to get the right one. Once we were finished our appetizers a server brought out our mains and set them down (to the right person this time) and left all of our appetizer plates on the table. My boyfriend and I had the chicken burger, the chicken was small and dry and over priced for what we received. I had to ask another server to bring our bill as we were in a hurry to catch the movie, this is when our server finally returned. She brought the bill and took the payment and never cleared ANY plates from out table. Really a shame this was such a bad experience, but there are many more restaurants and bars in the area.   TIp : don't order the ceaser to drink.. they don't use the conventional Clamato juice. I couldn't even drink half of it."}
{"text":"I always have loved the milestone chain. Went there today. Speedy, friend service. The meatloaf dinner was awesome !!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place does not feel the need to improve. Considered all the other reviews here and my past experiences.  Had the prime rib. It was dry, the steak knife couldn't even cut into the meat. Clearly the prime rib was left out for the whole day. The meat wasn't fresh at all. We Packed it up to bring it home for the dog, but second thought it wasn't even good enough for her to eat. She wouldn't have been able to chew it up- that's how dry it was. The texture was awful. We also ordered the burger. The burger patty was burnt. It was so crunchy all around because of the burnt bits. It was charred to a point that there was no meat taste to the burger.   They've always been mediocre, they should really should invest and improve the quality of the food."}
{"text":"I admit that I like milestones and I've been to this location about 5 times for various work functions and once with my brother and his kids.  They are definitely kid friendly.  They actually seated us right away because they saw we had two toddlers, who were very, very tired.  The food is solid.  I like the salads and the burgers.  They are very concientious about allergies so it is great if you need your food modified in some small way."}
{"text":"We wanted to try a new restaurant. I was far from be impressed by Milestones. The waitress seems to be in a rush all the time. I confirmed she was.  When the drinks came, in 5 drink (3 waters) one was missing. The taste on the other 2 drinks was not right. It seems the soda dispenser was bad.  To be fair the waitress told us that the food would take 30 mins and it took that. The food was ok.  You spend money on these places to have a good time and has a good experience. At the end of the meal, no one of us (5) would say that there was something to make us come here again."}
{"text":"Not good. Had fish tacos. Battered fish looked Like it had freezer burn. We also ordered pasta bolognese and it was full of mushrooms and no beef to be seen. Also the pasta dish was spicy.  The service was slow. Would not return."}
{"text":"Came over for a brunch with kids and had high hopes for the calamari appetizer but they were out of calamari and shrimps, altogether. Also the service was a tad slow."}
{"text":"The calamari appetizer occupied  half of the small plate.  Not worth the price you pay."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Took 10 mins for no one to notice us. It wasn't even during peak restaurant hours. It was around 2 so it wasn't busy and nobody shoukd be weeded ariund that time. I had to go find a server to take our order. Food has been down graded from pervious years. I used to look forward to their goat cheese appetizer. And the server was a snake when it came to pay by card. He had  bypassed the customers CHOICE to tip by $, %, or none. He had gone straight to %. Never again will I come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times but not because the food or service are exceptionally good but mostly because of the location and the convenience of it.  As soon as you step in, you will feel lost if it's your first time since there are two entrance to the restaurant; one from inside of the mall and one on Yonge St.  There are no host(ess) so you will have to hunt them down from my experience.  Then you will need to decide if you want to have a table on the second floor with a better view and fancier decor BUT a gauranteed wait even though most tables are empty.  After you are seated, expect to wait for waiter/waitress to take your order.  Then you will need to wait even longer for your food.  By the time you're done waiting, all your appetite will be gone and the last thing you would want to do is wait for the bill.  I cannot compliment or bash the food.  They're typical bar food and are not very hard to screw up yet it's not particularly good.  If you're looking for a bar to meet up, I guess the bar on the first floor isn't too bad; it's quiet and there's plenty of seating (some booths).  Just don't expect too much from the chef but do expect to wait and allocate a minimum of 90min for lunch and 2hrs for dinner.  If you're driving, I think they do validate your parking if you park on P2 which is on the south side of Empresswalk.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Visit this bar tonight because the weather  is nice and their seating area outside looked very inviting.  I was seated and  waited 20 minutes for waitress to even greet us, then she took our drink order and never return. I waited another 20 minutes and she waited on everyone else and never came back to us. I definitely feel it was a racial profiling tonight."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, despite my children not giving me a chance to sit down long! The service was excellent, really accommodating the kids' needs without compromising the rest of the meal. I had the cod and chips and it was okay but a fairly small portion and the fish wasn't as fresh as it could have been. The crumb was also not great, beer batter is the way forward! Slaw was nice but again, I wanted more. I think the dessert was the highlight, this really full on chocolate cake, so great. My husband had an interesting take on a red curry, quite dry but still nice. Overall the standouts were the friendly, professional service and the dessert."}
{"text":"We had our baby shower here and we were truly amazed by the excellent customer service. They have a private room at the back. The food was delicious,the general manager was always there to see if you needed anything. The server was always checking on us for drinks and food - you should make downtown milestone the destination for your next event."}
{"text":"Quick lunch bite today, the utensils were dirty, mugs still have lipstick marks from previous use...   Service was very slow, used to love their calamari... But today's food was so terrible, never going back again!"}
{"text":"I never write restaurant reviews but tonight I thought I had to write one. When Milestones first came to Toronto maybe about 15 years ago now, I thought the food was pretty good.  Today I took my wife and son to the new one on Enterprise blvd. for lunch. I ordered the mushroom soup and the garden burger. My wife had a chicken and pasta dish. The food was mediocre. The waiter said they changed 90% of their menu. Our waiter's hospitality was on the same level as the food. He never bothered to come by and ask how the food was, which I become accustomed to in Canadian restaurants. Now, the reason why I'm really writing this review is that at around 9:30pm at night, more than 6 hours after my lunch, I'm still feeling very thirsty. I must've drunk more than 3 liters of water by now. I remembered from my last visit at Milestones, years ago, that I had the same thirsty feeling. This usually means to me that there's a lot of MSG in the food. I don't think I will go back anymore. Anyone having the same thirsty feeling after a visit to Milestones?"}
{"text":"I had a gift card for this place, so I decided to try it out. All the food was flavorless and greasy to no end, especially the \"bocconcini garlic bread\" it was so greasy, I left sick after eating it.   Location wise, it is excellent, right by the Eaton Center and AMC complex, but there are many other food options around there now, I would rather get a sandwich from the food court downstairs if I am hungry.  The food quality is terrible for the price, but I guess you are paying for location, with so many better options around I don't know if location can save this place."}
{"text":"Ya, no. Have always had surprisingly good service and food at the Yorkdale location, so we thought we'd try the Richmond Hill location while in the area. It was a flop. The server asked if we had any food allergies and I noted that I did not want any raw onions. She laughed, presumably because it's so obvious that fish and chips would not run the risk of onion contamination.  Husband ordered a salad with some kind of chicken on it.  Drinks were good - they had that fancy Walter's Caesar mix on offer (it was roughly brunch time) and I had a really nice craft brew IPA.  Husband's salad came with avocado. The avocado was rock hard. Whoever made the salad and struggled to slice the avocado would have known it was not ripe. A shame they tried to pass it off. He asked for a ripe one instead and the salad was brought back with edible avocado. Great. My fish and chips were nothing to write home about. The fries were good (a little on the sweet side - maybe Yukon gold? -  I like them that way. The fish was lame. And, of course, it came with a coleslaw that was alive with onion. Bursting at the seams with the stuff. When the server came to check on us, my plate had the ridiculously large pile of picked-out onion on it and we said \"remember the whole \"no onions\" thing?\". She laughed.  When the bill came with no amendments, I asked if they hadn't planned to make up for the errors. She spoke to the manager and got us a whopping 5 bucks off our 80 dollar meal.  Not a raging injustice, obviously, but I would never go back."}
{"text":"Today Me and a group of friends went out to eat at milestones before our movie. The waitresses ignored us and did not take our order. When she finally came to take our order, the food took 1 hour and 15 minutes and the restaurant was not busy. Very poor service. Would it recommend."}
{"text":"Top chef menu-Two thumbs down!!!!  Milestones is the place where you go to for the sake of \"easy\", a too sweet bellini and a decent enough burger.  However, one of my dining partners tonight is a huge fan of Top Chef and insisted we go to try their seasonal \"top chef\" menu and so we did tonight.  Shoulda had the burger...  The starter pork croquettes tasted strangely like chicken liver, whereas another likened it to canned tuna fish.  Texture was very odd.   Main was the sablefish with seaweed gnocchi.  My fish had the skin on it, which was face down in the broth, so by the end of the meal, I had this black scaly goop which was so very unappetizing.  The fish itself was nice, clean tasting, no real flavour.  The seaweed gnocchi had no flavour at all and I likened it to mushy pablum.  Broth was sour/sweet odd but I was happy for any flavour at all by that point.   Also, one of us found 4 fish bones in her fish, while 2 of us found none.  Chew slowly!    Dessert-a DISASTER.  Strawberry shortcake with lemon curd.  They used salt instead of sugar for the lemon curd.  Made one of us gag and almost throw up.  They took it off the bill.  So in the end, the best part of the meal was the too sweet bellini.  Makes us wonder....if these dishes were the winners of Top Chef...poor McEwan."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs. Terrible and slow service, mediocre food. Would not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Had pesto penne pasta last night. .absolutely horrible. Had to be 15 to 20 pcs of whole cloves of garlic in a tasteless sauce. ."}
{"text":"They have interesting menu options however they don't execute the flavour profiles very well. It's like they are trying too hard to be diverse and offer too many different ethnic style foods such as Asian, Mexican, southern, etc. but they don't do any of them well. I gave this restaurant three tries in the past 3 years and each time was disappointed. I did not enjoy the food. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't something I'd pay for. It is supposed to be the higher end restaurant in the Cara Foods chain but the quality is definitely not high end. They need to reevaluate their menu and flavour profile. Stick to one thing and do it well."}
{"text":"The food and service qualtiy gone down about a year ago, I think the only thing I would order is prob the steak~ everything else is kind of !2!@#$#!!*"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waited 20 min for a table the almost an hour for food. Then the order was incomplete and inaccurate. Then waited too to long just to get the cheque."}
{"text":"Can't complain about this place even though it's a franchise.  Decent service but not great (she forgot to bring our silverware twice and my food got a bit cold) but the food was great for the price.  Good place for people watching"}
{"text":"Yummy food here!   But they took away the best appetizer, which was a platter full with a little - bit - of - everything ...wings, salad, spinach dip, and chips.  It was reasonably priced around $30.00. You can buy all the items still, just separately.   Maybe, just like me, people were just ordering that lol.   Bring it back guys!"}
{"text":"We just came here for desserts and some drinks.  Food - we ordered about 6 different desserts (sorry couldn't get pics of all of them) and they were fresh, hot and not disappointing.   Service - it seemed they were short staffed in the bar area because it took a while to get the attention of the waitress. It was surprising because it was a Saturday night and usually we weren't waiting like we did.  Atmosphere - the bar area has roughly 4 flat screens (that I noticed) and we were able to watch post season baseball and preseason hockey. Good selections on."}
{"text":"First time to visit this food chain. My friend and I ordered prime steak and it was so good. The service was also great as well as the ambiance.   I definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"If there is a franchise restaurant in Mississauga that can serve a decent brunch,  Milestones would be it.  Their brunch bundle including a choice of eggs Benedict, fruit salad and mimosa is an excellent deal and great value.  I opted for the breakfast tostada that comes with chorizo sausage and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Must try the raspberry mimosa, my favourite to order at Milestone's brunch."}
{"text":"I eat at Milestones quite often as it seems to be the default location for birthday parties these days. But for the amount you spend, you could easily find nicer places to eat at. I would generally suggest staying away from chain restaurants when it comes to big groups (ex: birthday parties) because they're always busy, especially on weekends, and they very often don't have a choice but to cut corners in the preparation of their dishes in order to accommodate for larger parties.     With all that said, if you must eat at Milestones or near the Eaton Centre, I would recommend this location. The food at Milestones is really nothing special, and neither is their coffee. What I do like are their bellinis and their cheesecake is also quite decent, but they probably order that from some other place anyway. This place however, has me sold on their atmosphere. Their patio is lovely with an overlooking view of the busy Yonge & Dundas intersection and their bar area is also really nice and spacious. I also really love all that natural light coming through the oversized windows."}
{"text":"Great burger, with your choice of side of fries or salad. brought to the table at a timely manner, service is good."}
{"text":"I do have to say I was excited about this Milestones opening up, since there are only 2 others in the city.  Its location in Market Mall, does draw a \"family\" crowd a bit during lunch, but can be quieter during the evening.  It is a very modern inside and has a good atmosphere to it.  When I went here first with my friend on a holiday weekday.   We were told it would be a 30 minute wait, but it was only 15 minutes!  They didn't seem all too organized at the front, they couldn't decide where to seat us, the girls seemed flustered.  After we were seated, they were good about getting a highchair for her little one, the waitress introduced herself and told us what the features were.  I ordered a Bellini, if anything come here for their Bellini's, they are amazing!  The place was pretty packed and a bit noisy because of that.  Both my friend and I got the lunch special, which included half a caibatta sandwich of our choice, the soup of the day and a salad, all for $11!  The soup was a butternut squash bisque, it was so good, I could have had 4 more bowls of it!  Actually the whole meal was great!  We had another couple drinks, then had to wait quite a while to get the bill.  The service was overall good for it being a busy day, the waitress was very friendly.    I returned again with my Husband for a dinner out.  We didn't wait long at all to be seated.  I again ordered a Bellini, and it took forever to come.  The waitress did apologize, telling me that they had to wait for the machine to freeze the slush.  I was craving fettuccine alfredo, but they only had the noodles with a pesto or a seafood sauce.  I inquired if I could get the fettuccine noodles with the asiago sauce and chicken they had with another pasta.  The waitress said it shouldn't be a problem.  Our food arrived in good time.   The pasta and chicken was very good, it definitely hit the spot!  Our bill came to about $50 just with a couple drinks each and our entrees.  The prices are very comparable to other grill and bar restaurants.  We had a nice dinner out here, the service was again good overall!  They do have brunch during the day, as well as a \"date night\" special on Wednesdays.  The prices on the menu range from $9-$30, so it really is pretty reasonable!  I would recommend Milestones for both lunch and dinner.  Don't forget to try their Bellini's, they are very yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm not a regular at Milestones but have been here enough times over the past few years to notice that their menu choices and food quality has consistently gotten worse as time goes on.  My friend ordered ahi tuna tacos and for $16, he got TWO tacos, a tiny garden salad and two deep fried avocado slices.  My other friend ordered meatloaf (don't ask me why) for $23.  Value was definitely lacking.    I got the Mayan burger for $16- this was the best dish out of the three.    Service was friendly enough but a bit distracted.  Menu is overpriced for what it is, beer specials aren't that great.  It takes 5 minutes of walking down a narrow hallway to reach the bathrooms.  Overall, no real reason to come here."}
{"text":"Vegi hamburger was wonderful and I take two points off because their bad service. no one was available to seat us. No one greeted us or brought the menu . It was a long wait to see the waitress. waitress dropped the plate in front of me and she was not checking on us . We actually had to find her to bring our main dish.  I would rate the food quality 4 and service 1"}
{"text":"Milestone's varies a bit from location to location, but I like this one. They have an extensive menu, are happy to substitute any of their burgers for veggie patties and have always given me good service (esp for reservations - I've held multiple events here!).  Vegetarian tip: order the Mayan burger with veggie pattie - love the avocado in there!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feeling about Milestone's. Food is really a hit or miss for me. Service is great, with very attentive staffs.  Great Bellini. Great place for drinks with big group. It's never really too crowded.  Here is couple of items that I have tried on the menu.  Grilled Shrimp California Benedict: On their Brunch menu. I love it. Love the avocado. Love the shrimp. yummy.   Beef Burger: I wasn't very impressed with their beef burger with Californian topping. They were a little cheap on the avocados spread. And, the burger appeared to be out of a box (Don't quote me, but it tasted a bit like Loblaw's burger). Hey, I like Loblaw's burger but I just feel a bit cheated when I'm getting grocery-store pre-packaged burger at a restaurant.  Pan Seared Scallops: There were 5-7 scallops which were very generous portion. However, it was a bit bland for a curry dish.  White Chocolate cheesecake: It was pretty good. Very rich."}
{"text":"Milestones in Oakville is a complete see-saw, in the up-swing the veggie burger was really good, and the d√©cor is so bizarre and uninspired that pretty much sums up the menu. On the downside the fries were petrified and debatably edible.   Would eat here again."}
{"text":"The shrimp and salmon salad I ordered didn't match the description in the menu. It advertises grilled pineapple and avocado and I couldn't find any in the salad. To make the situation worse the salmon was very undercooked. The waiter was friendly but didn't correct the problem with the food even after I sent it back and a new one was cooked the exact same way, although they did add some pieces of avocado. It's been awhile since I've had such a disappointing experience in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I usually really like Milestones but this one star is specifically for the obnoxious server. He came around to our table with his little server apprentice who seemed to be new I suppose? taking notes? I'm not sure. Didn't really bother me but the main server dude seemed to think he was the most charming person in the world who was gracing us with his presence.   So anyway, my friend wanted alternatives for her food due to dietary restrictions and he was very short with her. And as the evening progressed he forgot all about us. It took him 45 minutes FORTY FIVE MINUTES to clear our table. We kept trying to meet his gaze but he looked right through us till we finally asked someone else to help us out.   He came back to us eventually...and we asked for a dessert menu (our mistake I know) which took him yet another 20 minutes to bring. By then we had already spent around 2 and a half hours there and were losing our patience. So when he came back in another 15 minutes to take dessert order we  just asked for the bill instead.  After we paid the bill he just walked off without a word, no goodbye..no have a nice day..no sense of manners that you normally show to other people on a HUMAN level. It was highly disrespectful. Suffice it to say, never coming back here again. The server ruined the whole meal for us."}
{"text":"This milestones location has always been very close to my home, but I've only recently got to check this place out! My sisters and I came for brunch. When we arrived, there were only 2-3 tables that were filled (not full at all). I ordered the breakfast tosada which was quite filling and yummy! Mimosas were ordered as drinks which were decent. My rating is a 3 star because the service was very very slow. There was about 3 tables, 4 including us, and one of them already had their food, yet we waited almost an hour for our food to come, and one of my sister had received the wrong dish. Overall, the breakfast tosada  was great, drinks were decent, and just wish the service was faster."}
{"text":"Not the best of milestones. Been to others - they're okay, but not the one in Whitby. Were waiting for drinks for 10 mins. Some of us were served drinks, others at the same table were not. Servers gathered to clean the next table, sat there and started chatting and giggling amongst themselves. Not cool."}
{"text":"Poor food, poor service, poor experience. This place used to be great 10 years ago but it's not the same anymore. I would advise to visit the Dundas square location instead."}
{"text":"The food tastes better than other Milestones' locations. I enjoyed the calamari fries."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience at this Milestones at a recent family birthday. The food was ok (pretty much what you expect) but it was the staff that made it special. They went above and beyond to make sure we were well taken care of. Our waitress was great and let us substitute items with no fuss. She even offered to let us store a special dessert in their freezer as a surprise for the birthday boy. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Normally I find mall restaurants just mediocre, but I will admit that the Milestones at Market Mall to be better than most. (even better than the Milestones at Southland).  I often stop here when my wife is shopping and my buddy Jason the bartender is frequently  there to make sure my pint glass is never empty until I'm done. After the credit card is worn out, my wife will come back and we'll often have the crispy chicken bites then finish with the ganache torte. If we come for weekend brunch, I always get the chicken hash because it's the perfect combination of chicken, roasted red peppers, hash browns, eggs and hollandaise sauce.  Be sure to keep your receipt because you can fill out a short online survey and get a free appetizer on your next visit (which will get you another receipt for another free appy... rinse & repeat)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had his birthday dinner here and ordered a steak medium-done. After having the steak at Milestones, he had stomach pains and had to use the washroom a few times. Definitely a bad case of food poisoning. Will not be ordering steaks from Milestones again."}
{"text":"I love Milestones, just not so much this location - the meat which we requested to be well done was pink and bloody (for any of you folks who request been well done and get it pink, you know the horror) and our waitress did not check in with us once. I complained through the Milestone's website and no one got back to me. Overall, not too much of a fan anymore, I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Food was average and service was weak. I was the only person in the bar area and waited for someone to offer me another drink and clear my empty plate. Watching 4 staff members chatting and laughing simply made me feel like I was an inconvenience. Totally explained why the restaurants across the street were packed and this one was empty. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Dishes are hit and miss. Burger was good, but wings tasted burned and bitter. Service was average. Prices are on the high side.  Many better options around the neighborhood.  ____________________________________________  A quick update to my previous review.  Milestone customer service contacted me through yelp messaging and requested me to call back so that they can \"make it right\". I made the call and wanted to see what they had to offer. Spoke to a CSR and after providing a whole bunch of personal information, she said that she will need to forward that information to someone else who will call me and request more information on my experience. This first call took about 15 minutes. At the end of the call I asked what they would eventually offer and the CSR lady said that if my story checks out then they may give me a $10 gift card.  Told the CSR that I was no longer interested in taking this any further.   Not worth my time and trouble just for the possibility of getting a $10 gift card at Milestone, where I will not be visiting again anytime soon.  Changed my rating to 1 star now."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a date and we went to milestones for dinner. Our server was Samantha and she was the best waitress ! She was fast and super nice . We are expecting a baby and she brought me a dessert menu and told us to pick one. Super kind of her. Food was excellent. Delicious ! I had mushroom chicken and my bf had steak. Prices were good too and we got a ton of food ! I'm pregnant and eat a lot and I couldn't even finish my meal! Super happy with our date night !!! Will for sure go back !"}
{"text":"Your service staff really dropped the ball tonight. Milestones, prepare for an earful about my recent mouthfuls from your dundas/yonge location.  We asked for water with our drink order, and that water did not come. So we asked a couple of your passing waitstaff and hostesses to bring us some. This was not done. Our mozzarella balls came out. Very delicious, but we still need that water buddy, hey how about some plates for that app too?  We wait.  Like ten minutes? Not ok. 20 minutes without server assistance? Time to get real. So real I got. I noticed the server station, where the app plates were stored, along with those walk away debit machines and God knows what else. I was a server once, how hard could this be? I got up, walked over and began to rummage for plates. Got said plates and returned to my table sucessful and my dear mom mortified. But at least we had plates.  We ate our app. And it was perfect. In fact- culinary kudos to the Cara kitchen system. They manage their food with a level of scientific precision. Every dish we got tonight was excellent and you deserve a pat on the back cooks.  But it's only half the story.  There were servers there to help us get our water. And not just our server. There were hostesses, other servers, and this manager dude who I would really like to have a chat with. You all Failed, and it's sad because You are failing each other.  A good service is a team, a family, and they are a family who loves to entertain their guests. Hospitality gushes from this family. Their head (that's you manager dude) can oversee, forecast and eliminate problems before they occur. You should have seen me going through your wait station. I could have been stealing your debit machines or any cash left there or pouring arsenic into a pitcher of water and you didn't even notice. Now I wouldn't do that, ever, but I am not everyone and I am betting there are some who could do that. Our server was clearly not keeping up, yet none of your hostesses jumped in to help her. You have to plan, direct, and motivate your staff. It's part of running a good restaurant.  Now. I WILL be back. I don't write off a restaurant just because of one bad experience. (Food was yummers! Yay!) But pull yourself up as a team servers. It's the part of that job that makes it worthwhile, and there's a great satisfaction you will feel in your heart (and your wallet) when you do."}
{"text":"Ate here on April 7, 2016 and was very disappointed. Menu has changed and does not have quality choices and the food was poor and had very small proportions. Very overrated restaurant. Looked like it may be a good place to go have a drink though, just as you don't order the calamari appetizer....yuck"}
{"text":"Came here on a pretty much empty weeknight because we were starving and was in the area. The food was decent. We got the appetizer platter that you can share which comes with some good stuff like spinach artichoke dip and brie pesto flatbread. We also got the 5 mini dessert shots which were all delicious except the key-lime pie. Definitely something you should get if you want a bit of everything. Overall, the food was decent tasting.  So why did I give 2 stars? the SERVICE WAS AWFUL. I assume it was a bad day for the waitress or something, because she was absolutely rude to us from beginning to end. No smile whatsoever, never came by to refill out waters. She gave us DIRTY serving plates, and served the dessert while we were still working on the main dish. What resulted was our dessert MELTING by the time we got to it. Through the entire night we were polite and friendly with her, even though she gave us so much attitude back. I have not experienced such awful service in a long time. Very unhappy - and I completely regret tipping the girl."}
{"text":"The final stop of our after-conference parties was at Milestone's. The lounge side was sectioned off for the event and we were elated that there was seating! After grabbing some drinks, we sat down to observe what was going on around us.  There were a few tables set up with appies so we headed over - spinach & artichoke dip, yam fries, phyllo shrimp, bruschetta, goat cheese flat bread and beef sliders.  I grabbed a beef slider and a few phyllo shrimps. The shrimps were great - crispy and flavorful! The beef slider was not pleasant. The meat had the texture of spam - mealy and crumbly. I ate what I had bit off and  hid the rest in my napkin . . .  The atmosphere in the lounge was great, they had music on that wasn't too loud so you could carry on a convo, abundant amount of seating and good service.  They brought out more food as the night progressed, we were offered chicken wings which we each took one - and soon my napkin burger had a buddy. The sauce on the wings were so hot it burned your lips and tongue instantly. I like a little kick to my food, but a full on face assault wasn't appreciated.  The event was set to go till midnight, but the bar stopped serving at 10 PM and no one was impressed - especially the vendor company hosting the party. That pretty much drove a lot of people to leave, us included.   Will I be back to Milestone's? Probably next year when the vendor holds the after conference event again but not on my own accord. The food seems to be hit and miss (based on my experience and other people's reviews) and honestly how they handled \"closing down\" the event was kinda rude. They might as well have gone the night club route - yelled out last call, turned off the music and turned on the ugly lights."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for a GF chocolates dessert with their ganache. YUM. The GF burger is delish too. Go back just for these! ...Today I ordered a super tasty salad and they said they could make it GF by omitting the noodles; great! It was tasty and the pineapple was a nice addition to the salmon and shrimp...and then there were bits of noodles in the bottom. Hmmmm. That, plus the fact that another twosome came in after we did and were seated first, is enough to say Buh-Bye Milestones, you've lost me as a regular."}
{"text":"Awful food, took forever, service ignored me and flirted with the men, servers were a bunch of short-skirted young women which affects the feel of the place from nice and classy to bar-like and trashy. My salad cost a ridiculous amount and had nothing interesting in it whatsoever/tasted like eating a leaves I picked off a tree. Music was annoying. Place was pretty and clean, however, and the staff did keep up appearances."}
{"text":"Milestones has a good selection of food with an even better selection of drinks.  The food selection isn't unlike half of the restaurants out there but they make it better. Like the Kobe Beef Meatloaf, it's fantastic.  If you have a big group don't attempt Milestones without a reservation, they are often lined up and some of the tables in the lounge that may seat your party might not fit all of your plates (they are arranged more for drinks then for meals.)  But there is nothing wrong with going to Milestones just for drinks. They make a mean martini and the atmosphere is great for a date or going with friends because unlike many of the bars on Steven Ave Milestones isn't so loud that you can't talk to each other."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner & drinks ... first beer came in a cracked glass and had to be returned to the bar ourselves, burger had no flavour and seemed to be the frozen boxed kind; salmon salad lacked dressing until I realized it was all in the bottom inch of the bowl; none of these were addressed to the waiter because he only came at the end to collect our money.  We both agreed we may come back for drinks and appetizers on the patio but definitely not ever again for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to Milestone's for years - it's where we have celebrated our anniversary for the past 10 years. Tonight we came for a date night. Our first turn off was the sign outside the restaurant had two of the letters burnt out. For a restaurant of Milestones calibre I thought that was in poor taste. The restaurant was not even half full which seemed odd for a Saturday night at 8:30 - another bad sign. My husband and I both settled on the Prime Rib only to be told it was sold out. The service was ridiculously slow. Every single course took way too long to come out - especially dessert. The kicker was the Chocolate Ganache Torte which has been my fav dessert here for years. They changed the crust and the caramel sauce and its just not the same - I didn't enjoy it. Unfortunately this is my second consecutive bad experience at this location.  I think we'll be looking for somewhere else to celebrate our anniversary this year!!"}
{"text":"Went to the downtown Milestones last night with friends from work for some food, drinks and laughs.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos, and boy was I dissappointed! Barely any fish and the tortillas were stale and cold, likely right out of the fridge. Shocking the quality at those prices.  Drinks and ambiance were fine, and the servers were helpful and nice. But it seems like a lot of the food is really hit or miss. I certainly will be giving this place a miss in the future!"}
{"text":"Inside is nice, small patio, service is good but the food is only so so. I had the sea bass. They put Cilantro in the rice (I'm not a fan of it) and the sea bass was rather tasteless. The mushrooms were quite tasty and fresh. The meal was not served overly hot. Overall the portion size was quite small for $19.95 meal. Wine list was reasonable. I won't be rushing back but it wasn't horrible either."}
{"text":"Milestones is rapidly becoming one of my least favorite restaurants and this one seems particularly bad. There were 3 of us at the table. One meal was perfect. The other two (steaks) were not. They were under cooked (I asked for med rare and it came rare, the other one was ordered medium and it came medium rare) the vegetables were very unappealing, the garlic mashed potatoes looked awful, service was average. We sent one of the meals back only to have it come back with the wrong side dish. We asked for water no ice ... of course lots of ice. The meal was a mess. The manager came by three times and for our woes she gave us a free appetizer for next time? Yes I'll be back to use the free appetizer card and spend more money ... As if. If your looking for somewhere to go before a movie ... Go ANYWHERE else :)"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for a family gathering. I came 10 minutes early to make sure we had our table. They had given our table away and offered to separate booth instead hostess didn't really care. Poor service, will definitely not come back"}
{"text":"Do not get the chicken & waffle. It's basically one small waffle with just a piece of chicken fillet. What a rip off. But 2 stars only cause of the server."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last week. The calamari dish has changed. No andouille sauce. Greasy calamari. No coke, only Pepsi. Rum and coke is not the same as rum and fountain Pepsi. The $32 ribeye was thin and tough. Could not eat. Thankfully, they did not charge me for the steak. Great mushroom soup. I used to be a fan of Milestones but no more."}
{"text":"Service from Jared was horrible.  Asked for lemons on multiple occasions and he said to my wife 'it might take a while if I get around to it.'  (It was a Tuesday night, it wasn't that busy) He never got around to it.  He also never asked how our food was, either.  I didn't get around to leaving him a tip because he was a downright jerk.  At any rate, the ambiance is nice and the view is great. The hostesses were amiable, and the food was OK.  It's Milestones, it's just like the rest of them...mediocre at best, but the ambiance at this one is great."}
{"text":"I attended this Milestones today for lunch and even though the food was good, I experienced really mediocre and almost don't care attitude in their service.   First of all the restaurant was less than half full. We were a group of 10 individuals and probably the only group that had this many people. But it took almost 30 minutes from the time we ordered and got out food. Lunch times are when everyone wants to eat as fast as possible and get back to their desks but I don't think the restaurants didn't have any interest in serving as quickly as possible.  2nd of all, my friend ordered a salad and mentioned that hes allergic to nuts and to remove it from the item. A waitress (not our initial waiter) brought the food to all of us and placed the salad that my friend ordered in front of him with some nut like garnish on top of it. When my friend asked what it was she almost casually said that \"those can be pine nuts\". Then she almost ran away when we had to call her back (at this point she seemed a bit annoyed) and when we mentioned that we said no nuts, she was like \"your waiter should have taken care of it\" in an almost disregarding manner. Then when we inquired our waiter about the garnish he mentioned \"yeah it doesn't have nuts but if you want you don't need to eat it\". This is NOT how service should be done! Nut allergies can kill people and I cannot believe the waitress had such an attitude towards it. This is totally unacceptable.  Lastly, immediately after our food was placed on the table, the waiter asks us how the food tastes and I am going \"can you let us eat first?\" ( i didn't mention it to him but whats up with this?)  Overall not a pleasant experience. Probably attests to the fact of why the restaurant was less than half full while the Jack Astors etc right opposite seems to have a good flow of customers."}
{"text":"I Order AAA steak mid rare and get it to me blue. Then I ask the waiter to take away and ask the cook to re cook it and came  back burnt. Then ask the waiter take it away and I order something else. So I decided to order some easy as I had my wife and friend who was almost done their dinner. So I order a hamburger and fries think that no one could screw this up I was wrong. The hamburger burnt and the fries was still drooling in the middle. Thank you for the discussing meal and never going to eat it here again. Oh ya thank you for the upset stomach."}
{"text":"During my last visit to Milestones my friend found not only one but two hairs in her sandwich. She found one while we were there which she let slide but then later found one again in her leftovers once we got home...   The service wasn't great either, just adding to the bad experience."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night. Super slow service, and horribly cooked steak. I don't normally order steak from a \"non steak house\", this was a reminder why. I asked for medium rare and got medium well. The best part was that when the waitress came to pick up my plate with 2/3 of the steak left, she didn't have the common sense to ask if I had an issue LOL. On the bright side the cheese cake was good."}
{"text":"A patio on Stephen Ave for people watching? Check. Sunshine at 5pm? Check. Crazy happy hour drink deals? Check!  Finding a patio spot with sunshine after work can be tricky - especially along Stephen Ave. Generally the south-side street patios don't get much sunshine with the shade from other buildings, but this one is wider than others and it was fairly easy to still get a spot in the sun after 4:30pm (on a Tuesday).  The happy hour deal is every day 3pm - 6pm, with $4 (!) bellinis, Grizzly Paw Beer, 1oz high balls and 5oz glasses of wine. I can only vouch for the bellinis but they were DELICIOUS. There's no food deals on for happy hour and the service was more on the average side, but for cheap drinks in the sunshine it was a pretty great spot! The server also automatically split our bill, which is always nice."}
{"text":"All the Milestones I've been to have been fairly consistent, with decent/friendly/COMPETENT service.  Our waitress didn't even have to write down our orders and got them all right.  She was also very patient as we kind of deliberated over what we were getting.  I got the sliders (mini hamburgers) which were decent.  The food is always pretty good, but nothing phenomenal. I had a mojito the last time I was there and it was okay though I found there was too much mint/cilantro? But then I don't really like mojitos that much anyways. xD  Good place to have lunch/dinner with your friends, not too loud and I really have to commend the great service they always have. I've been to like three Milestones maybe and the waiters/waitresses are always really nice."}
{"text":"Came by on my lunch break to get a quick meal. I wound up waiting for 30 minutes for my app and 50 for my entree. The manager however was amazing, he was attentive to all tables."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible experience. We had a big group so I understand that large groups are tough for servers to manage but our server served half the table water and disappeared for half an hour. When the server came back she was incredibly arrogant and impatient with taking orders.   The bar staff was no better and made us wait for another half hour because they apparently ran out of glasses. Given the fact that the restaurant was barely at half capacity for a Saturday night, I think the overall operations of this restaurant need a huge overhaul.   I'm never going back here again and will try to make sure no one else makes the mistake of going here again."}
{"text":"Mediocre food with nice ambience.  The salads are great though. But because it is more expensive I would hit up a restaurnt more deserving."}
{"text":"I went to this milestones last weekend for brunch and unfortunately it wasn't a great experience at all. First of all it took them 15 minutes to cone to our table to get our drink order meanwhile there was only four table in the restaurant. I ordered mimosa and when it came i noticed that the glass was cracked. I ordered Benedict and it wasn't done the way i asked for it and the fruits were not fresh at all."}
{"text":"Always great service and excellent food  Every time I've come here, the staff is friendly, quick and efficient. The new menu options are also amazing! Definitely a favourite go to spot"}
{"text":"I have Milestone's related trauma.  Seriously. It's taken me MONTHS to even write this. I went with man-friend, and got what used to be my fav salad. I munched away happily until I uncovered a fly, embedded to his untimely death in my goat cheese. Bye bye appetite.  I have to say, the entire staff dealt with this as well as they could, the dish was comped, the manager spoke to us, he seemed pretty freaked... But there's just no winning me back. I know mistakes happen... But for me, this one is too big to get over."}
{"text":"My friends forced me to try this place and I did not regret it at all. AlI the food that I tried was good, from appetizers to dessert. We started off with garlic bread and I liked how it wasn't the traditional garlic bread. It was made into a square with cheese and a tomato topping and I loved the combination.   We ordered Hot Spinach & Artichoke Dip, Garlic Cheese Bread, Mediterranean Chicken, Pesto Chicken Penne Asiago, Crispy Chicken Sandwich and Sirloin with Crab and Shrimp. My favourite was the spicy pesto penne and Sirloin. I didn't know that crab meat and Sirloin would go so well together.   I usually go to places that are known for their dessert, so I thought if they can cook the dishes so well, why cant they make my dessert just as good. So to end this perfect dinning experience we ordered \"The Decadent Duo\" and just as I thought the dessert was \"perfect\". It was actually two deserts in one. One was the cheesecake and the other was some kind of chocolate torte.   We didn't have to wait long for our table, which was surprising since it was a weekend.  I would definitely come back to this place to have the garlic bread and pesto chicken penne asiago and the desert of course."}
{"text":"Great service cold food. Management said she witnessed the food coming out. Had eggs Benedict.  Egg, ham and sauce were cold. English muffin was hard. Potato was very good."}
{"text":"Best in town for brunch and  family time. Great food.. eggs benny my fav. and my kids also love to go to this place. Its clean , staff is friendly.  Great tasting food. Def. be back."}
{"text":"I come here for casual or formal get togethers with friends and date nights with the boyfriend. This place has great ambiance, and definitely caters to a younger crowd. The service is average depending on the day and time you decide to go. Otherwise, you'll be waiting quite awhile based how busy they are but the food usually arrives to the table in a reasonable amount of time. I do recommend calling in advance for reservations during dinner and on Thursday - Sunday. Don't be afraid to be adventurous and explore the menu, so far everything from their sandwiches to steaks have been delicious and I have no complaints. Also, if you're feeling indecisive about what desert to get they're mini desert trio is immediately the go to. (It also gives you an excuse not to share). The price range can also vary depending on what you order but taste, consistency and quality of food is worth the exploration. This is one of those restaurants that will always pop up in your options/conversations of places to go when deciding on where and what to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Friday night for dinner. The d√©cor is very nice and the hosts were inviting. I ordered a steak with quinoa as a side. The presentation was lovely but I wasn't very impressed with the taste of either one - the steak was flavorless and the quinoa was very dry. I wouldn't consider myself an expert BBQ'er but I've made much better steaks at home. If you are looking to take someone somewhere nice for a drink this could be a great spot - however you can find much better places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"This is our third visit to this Milestones and each visit was great meals with great service reasonably priced. This time we had a free $11.00 calamari grilled appetizer promotion from a previous visit and split a Kobi Meatloaf dinner, more than enough food, cooked to perfection just the way we asked and deliver to our table HOT. This is not received at the majority of restaurants we have visited recently."}
{"text":"I'll generally don't eat at milestones. Not a fan of chain restaurants.  I ordered the steak and eggs. My steak was supposed to be medium cooked and it was well done and felt like it was old and nuked.  Gross"}
{"text":"This place was horrendous. I always get bad service/food at milestones (usually go to the ones in downtown Toronto) but for some reason i go back and give them another chance.  So this is what happened: I order the crispy chicken burger, the only thing i ever get at this spot, and my friend orders a side of salad with NO bacon. I get the chicken burger and it tastes nothing like it usually does.. tastes more fishy and bland than crispy spicy chicken. I have barely 3 bites and leave the rest. My friend is halfway through her salad when she notices bits of bacon. Wtf? We call the server over and mention that we said NO bacon on the salad and then i ask him why my chicken burger tastes like fish and is not spicy AT ALL and he says he is positive its chicken.... 10 minutes later the manager passes by to tell us that dessert is on the house and he will not charge me for the burger (which i appreciate. I just wish i was able to enjoy a good meal after a long day at work). My friend orders her free dessert (donuts), and then the server comes by 10 minutes later to inform us that they actually ran out of donuts.   I hate milestones. The service is usually bad (mostly in downtown) and the food is crappy as hell. Oh did i mention i got home and projectile vomited ? Yep. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"We decided to give this Milestones a second chance after our disastrous visit 3 month ago.  It was like night and day from the previous visit.  The server was attentive and got all our orders correct.  The good was served at appropriate time limit and was hot and delicious.  Our experience improved 100%.  I am glad that my we went back to give this place another try."}
{"text":"The food at milestones has gone way downhill... Over priced, and low quality.  The staff were great, but everything else was below average."}
{"text":"Man I was dying on how long they took to bring the food. I ordered burger without the bun and all I got was the avocado with the meat, I asked the waiter where is the tomatoes and stuff he was shocked lol! Took it back and brought back everything that was need it expect the bun - Exactly what I've asked for. However by that time the food wasn't hot or even warm to begin with, my friend request kitchen but by the time that came I was done with the food. We were dying on how long this process took lol! Anyways, great view from the top, if you wanna go for drinks or appetizer go ahead I'm sure you'll have a great time just do not order anything else asides from that lol! Good luck & have fun :)"}
{"text":"Well, last week I was at the milestones in east Beaver creek and had an Asian Chopped salad for lunch. - it was great but aparently, not all milestones are created equally.  I had read all the reviews about this restaurant and my experience was consistent with the reviews.  The staff were supper friendly - and attentive but the first sign was at 6:00 pm I wanted to order a salad from the healthy menu and it was sold out - which means the location is not managing the supplies well.  I had the Thai Basil Noodles ( Pad Thai). It was dry and lacked taste.  The next table over sent back his Prime Rib because it was way over done and the manager ended up at the table next to that one getting a talking to from a patron. The restaurant smelled like cleaning solution - they must use something on the floors that does not leave it smelling fresh. Overall, staff were great, it smelled bad and the food at this location wasn't great."}
{"text":"I ordered a Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. I opened it at home and was disappointed to see no goat cheese, no kale, and no pecans. How could you forget one of the ingredients that's in the name of the plate?! On top of that there were very few beets, and most of this salad ended up being just arugula. So I called and explained the situation. The manager says I either have to go back there for a new one (I live very far) or wait until I go back next time to get a new one on the house. She said she would even throw in a free dessert. So Monday, I go to get my free food, and she keeps denying that she ever said a word about a free dessert! I didn't get her name, but that's how you lose a customer. I got the butternut squash ravioli instead of the salad, and it filled less than a third of the takeout container. Milestones, get it together."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight and will not be returning to this specific location.   Ordered the 7oz steak and frites and was immensely disappointed.  - Steak was served already sliced. there wasn't any meat juice left within the steak - meat itself was tasteless and bland. there was a gravy sauce that was served with the steak and i felt like i was eating chewy gravy instead - ordered medium rare and it was more medium - fries and onion bits that came with the steak was cold and soggy  Service was slow. there weren't that many tables and i found it difficult to get our servers attention.   there are fast food places that serve better food than what i had :("}
{"text":"Very slow service and mediocre food. In toronto? Please. They did try and rectify with free dessert, but not enough to keep me from posting this.  Search on for another place..."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant. The Bellinis on Ladies night are the same as a adult slurpee - not to special by any means.  The salad off the $5 menu was decent - the goat cheese with poppy seeds helped make it tasty.  Stick to the wine list - that cocktail was vial.  The inside of the restaurant is plain - again, like a giant box but people come for the deck and the people watching. I was dragged there as I rarely hit chains (Canadian Chain).  Nothing special by any means....but the server was nice.  Oh, lose the tacky little animals and mermaids in the glasses.  WE aren't 5 year old children."}
{"text":"Milestone's is known for descent upscale pub food. The food is great, I love their burgers.  Unfortunately, the service at this location is hit or miss.  We were in a rush to grab our bill and it took forever to pay by credit.  The waitress forgot about us on the patio.  I had to get up twice to ask for the status of bill.  The patio at this location is great for people watching.  They even have daily drinks specials.  Stop by this Milestone's if you are in the Richmond/John area!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty poor experience here. I was really excited to try milestones for the first time. My family was up visiting me so I said let's try here. Very nice environment and great wait staff! But the food was not good. I ordered the steak and mashed potatoes. The steak was ordered medium rare and came out VERY under cooked. The potato's were cool. A few bites and trying to force it down and I had to send it back. They credited our bill and gave me a dessert which was very nice. Unfortunately the dessert was also very disappointing and the churros were over cooked and tasted awful. If it wasn't for the food, I would have definitely gone back."}
{"text":"I had a lunch meeting at Milestone's today.  It was my first time to the location, I had trouble figuring out where the entrance was.  For future reference, it is the doorways leading to AMC theatres and the food court.  I have been to other Milestone locations that the service is great, no different at this location.  The food is standard, upscale pub grub, no complaints.  I was impressed by how quickly our lunch order came out.  Lunch meeting in under an hour, now that is a power lunch.  They have a great patio overlooking Yonge & Dundas square!  I will be back in summer for sure!"}
{"text":"I actually went here twice this past week, once on Monday, once on Wednesday. The first time I went it was really dead on a Monday night passed 10pm. There were a total of two servers on duty however my friend had trouble getting a refill of water. This was not impressive. Considering there was a total of two tables there was no need to take forever with providing a friend of mine a refill of water. How hard is it to bring someone water when you don't have to tend to many tables? Not to mention the server with an irish accent was very unenthused and looked like he hated his life, it did not make for a better experience.   The second night I came back with a friend and our server's name was Jamie. She was nice but my goodness she was a pretty bad server. Again it was Wednesday night at ten pm. it was semi active and she seemed to be wandering most of the time. it wasn't until the third time she came to our table to get our order for water which she should have done sooner. She also gave us tonnes of menus and left it on the table near the end of our visit which was obstructing the table space. She seemed to avoid the table, that was the feeling we got. I ordered the harissa chicken and literally five seconds after getting our order she asked us how our meals were and we didnt even get much out of it yet but we simply said it was good because thats how we felt upon the first five seconds of eating it. but what I hadnt expected was that the harissa chicken was spicy, I can remember that when I had it, it was NOT spicy. unfortunately I cant handle when its too spicy, mild would've been fine. She didn't tell me that and it did not say that on the menu what so ever. Most places indicate what is spicy on the menu but it did not. I had to send it back. I wanted to track her down but I had trouble doing so...she was nowhere around so I approached that same irish server from the Monday. a bit later, we caught sight of her and the irish server. he pointed at our table and the waitress saw us. the impression we got was he told her what I had told him, that I did not like my dish and I wanted to place an order for something else, She did not take the initiative to come to my table and address the situation that I had with my dish even after he mentioned it to her. She wandered off and did not come for awhile. When she finally came to our table she behaved as if it was all peaches and cream and had no clue that the dish was too spicy for me too handle after my friend and I had the hunch that she knew exactly what was the issue. so I had to tell her and she was nice about it and allowed me to order something else, she took my plate and left my friends empty plate in front of her for a while. it wasn't till we got the bill that my friends plate left her. it took awhile for her to bring the bill, then the machine for the credit card, then for change.....again it was not too busy, she has only three tables. it was just such an unappealing experience, id only come back because I like most of their food and not their service....both occasions that I went here ...the servers were not attentive to their guests."}
{"text":"Generally speaking when I travel I try not to go to chain restaurants and try something new. On a trip to Calgary circumstance dictated that my wife and I stop for some appetizers and drinks at Milestones. Having been to Milestones in Edmonton I already new what to expect; generally decent food with a slightly higher price points. I don't mind paying a big more but generally the quality needs to justify the expense. While Milestones plays itself up as something above the norm I find it generally still lacks.   This experience saw us try some different appetizers. We had mussels and a goat cheese dip. Both were done very well with subtle and nuanced flavours. The presentation was great and there seemed to be special attention to each detail. Their drink selection was decent and the sale on ceasars that night didn't hurt! I found their drinks to be mixed very well with a nice splash of creativity.  The overall experience is what you might expect from any Milestones but this location seemed to just kick it up a notch. I was very pleasantly surprised and am sure to go back."}
{"text":"The main reason for coming here is good location to hang out with friends.  Their food is not great but it is okay.  They have great cocktails, good atmosphere.  I would recommend to enjoy your drinks and food on the balcony because it is nice view.  Service is little slow.  Anyways they have good draft beer, cocktail selection, balcony seating."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, massive menu, something for everybody. I've been several times and never ordered the same thing twice (unusual for me, I usually find one item on a menu and stick to it). Excellent goat cheese appetizer. You must try their signature bellinis!"}
{"text":"PRO'S: - Vegans options (veggie burger, salad, butternut squash ravioli).  - Nice atmosphere.  - Friendly staff.  - If you are with a big diverse group of people, there are items on the menu to appease everyone. (i.e. my birthday with siblings, parents, grandparents). Everyone liked the food!  CON'S:  butternut squash ravioli with cheese is over 1000 calories!!!!!!!!!!!! i asked for NO cheese so that probably shaves off 200 calories but STILL"}
{"text":"The food was good. However the service was really so so . We told the server we are having a birthday dinner , however we did not not even get a free dessert. One of the girl told us to remember to mention that to our server . Also we have a kid and we ordered the kid meal, at the end she is supposed to get a scope of ice cream. We waited for 15 mins at least for the ice cream."}
{"text":"Had the best time here tonight! Our server Kenna was amazing! So attentive and sweet the entire time. All of the staff were friendly and funny! The drinks were delicious and the atmosphere amazing! We will definitely be back! Thank you for a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Met with three friends for dinner. The entree was nothing spectacular. I had the Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad and for dessert, Churros. The salad was a little over priced for the portion size. The Churros were amazing.  Servers were attentive and the place was clean. The washroom could do with a little attention. Overall a nice place to have a dinner out with friends."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, rude service!!!  Normally I like Milestones (the food is usually  very good) but this was my first time at this location.  We sat down, were given water and menus.  It was very crowded and busy -- and we watched as other tables left in frustration.  After a half hour of waiting for either our food or a glass of wine we asked our server our status.  Now this is a quote \"The bar is really backed up so you'll get your drinks when you get 'em.\" Needless to say, we walked out.  Went down to the Shark Club and our server was delightful!"}
{"text":"It was good experience. I found seat at the bar after checking with Jack asters and the other bar in the building. They were so full. It seams more people doing the same like me. The bar start to fill up now. The bar tenders are so nice and friendly. They have good selection of draft bear. I don't know about the food."}
{"text":"Another run down chain!  The location does get busy at times as its in the heart of heartland!  Service was ok as the servers were friendly but slow and didn't come to check on us in very late in the game.  The furniture needs to be changed as the chairs we were sitting had their cushions cut and were sinking in.   We were their late so went in for dessert and hot drinks. I tried their dessert thing which had a bit of everything and there were some goodies and some not so goodies, I also had their latte and would not recommend it as they charge you premium for a not  shitty cup with pretty much foam from the machine.   On a seprate note : There over all dessert choices weren't that great either."}
{"text":"Our appetizer never showed. Ordered a burger with fries and everything was cold. Girlfriend ordered a drink before dinner. We've finished eating and we're still waiting for it.  \"Oh, we're busy tonight.\"  EDIT: I was angry and wrote the above at the restaurant during the 30 or so minutes it took to get that last drink and our bill. I haven't really cooled down after almost a month, so I feel I should add more detail.   When we sat down, we had enough time to decide on an appetizer and our meals before the waitress showed up at all, so we ordered everything all up front. I suppose this was a mistake. I ordered a beer, which was not as cold as I'd like a beer to be, and given how long it took to get it, I already didn't trust that I'd get another for when my meal arrived, so I rationed it. Our appetizer never came out. We ordered the artichoke dip. I know this is probably just sitting in a pot ready be scooped and served with chips from a bag, so it's completely unacceptable that it never showed.   When questioned about it as our meal arrived, our waitress insisted it wasn't her fault that it didn't come. The meal arrived 40 minutes after we'd ordered, and that was the second time we saw our server. My girlfriend ordered a drink that would show up another 30-35 minutes later with the intention of having it with her dinner. My beer was now warm. My meal was cold, and had obviously been sitting out for some time. My girlfriend's pasta was burnt. I don't know what we could have done for her meal, but mine could have been heated up. I ate slowly, because at this point I was terribly hungry, but still had hope our waitress would drop by after a few minutes to see how our meal was. That didn't happen.   Our plates were cleared, and later, our server checked on us for a third time, missing drink in tow. Again, she told us it wasn't her fault. We asked for our bill, and after about 20 minutes, it came.   How could it be our server's fault that she didn't care about us enough to show her face after we got our meal? How could it be her fault that she didn't check that we got our appetizer? Or that our meals were prepared poorly?   The credit card machine suggested we tip 25% for this experience. I wanted to smash the thing on the floor. I felt like I was being mugged. What was supposed to be a nice night out with my girlfriend was ruined, and I was in a pissy mood for the rest of the night.   We sent a complaint to the restaurant and they invited us back for a free dinner. We were assigned their \"best server\", said the manager, and we received great service and mediocre food, but this was in a controlled situation on a Thursday. It's hard to recommend this place though because you could get stuck with that same apathetic service we got the first time."}
{"text":"My friends Robert and Monique took me out for lunch on Wednesday.  As I live close to Market Mall, we went there.  The first restaurant that we hit was Moxie's, but the wait was going to be too long.  So, then we went to Milestone's.  There was going to be a bit of a wait there too, but when we asked about sitting in the high chairs, we could sit right down.  I think that the high chairs area should have been offered by the hostess without my having to ask.  The lunch prices were, in my opinion, rather high too, but okay.  Robert went with a clubhouse sandwich; Monique went with salmon; and I went with a vegetarian burger.  There were multiple sides to choose from; I went with a green salad.  I also had a hot chocolate without whipped cream.  Everything was very good and enjoyable and we had a non-annoying, pleasant waitress.  When we asked for hot water, we were given hot water with lemon wedges, which was a nice touch and appreciated.  All in all, it was a special treat for me, someone who is financially challenged and who does not (get to) go out much."}
{"text":"This seems like the Canadian version of Seasons 52...a gloried US Chain.  It was Canada Day and since Canadians treat they're citizen well so a majority of the other restaurants I wanted to eat at were closed or full so we defaulted to Milestones.  The food was decent-I had the meatloaf and the decor was modern and eclectic.  However; the service is quite possibly the worst I've experienced.  Our useless server didn't get our dinner orders until after we had drinks and an appetizer.  On top of this, we waited 20 minutes to receive the check and were forced to leave an 18% tip due to the damned debit machine they bring to the table.  Unless it's another national holiday, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Staff not really welcoming. Took forever to get our drinks (more than 20 min!!!).  Food was also served quite a while after ordering it.  Will definitely not recommend the place.."}
{"text":"I will be honest with you I kind of struggle with their menu as I eat halal meat and they don't have the best dishes available for vegetarian or seafood lovers. Never the less there are few options on the menu to fill your tummy.  The location itself is great as the restaurant is setup very nice and looks as high scale restaurant with nice lighting and seats. The server was very friendly and quick to take orders and provide suggestions and that what I love.  I ordered their vegetarian burger which came with nice sized fries. The burger was a little dry adding a sauce would help.   Overall good experience but average food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love milestones. Good food, good price, excellent service although they are late at times."}
{"text":"They have not changed their menu in quite some time.  The only thing that changed about this location was a minor change to their decor.  The front entrance had changed slightly.  Other than that it is all the same.    It will be a very long time before I revisit a Milestones again."}
{"text":"I would give NEGATIVE STARS if it's possible. WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER. Came here on a Friday night and the service was extremely slow. Our server was new and she got our order wrong and we waited extra time for our order to be correctly brought to the table. This place was so loud, you can barely hear when you talk to your guests.   The service was horrible. The server literally came over twice the whole dining experience. If she can't handle so many tables at once, maybe the management is to blame.  Spoke to the manager in the purple/blue shirt and he was a joke. He was arrogant and refused to admit the restaurant server had any issues or the fact service was at a snail pace.   The restaurant is racist and does not care about anyone!  Worst dining experience for overpriced food that was not even what we ordered! Pathetic that's all I can say!  Service 0/5 Management 0/5 Food 1/5  Avoid this place and don't ruin your night !"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and had their prime rib benny. They don't call it their signature dish for nothing. Meat with the mushrooms was really moist and delicious! What would've made this a 5 star is if they added some salad and/fruits with this dish. Wonderful carbs but with something this yummy for $15.50 I do expect a well rounded meal! I'll still come back and try their other signature brunch dishes!"}
{"text":"Sitting at Milestones right now, 45 mins and still waiting for our meal. Our waiter has checked on us once.  Last time we were here, meals came out barely warm. Sorry Milestones, but this is the last time you'll be seeing us here. Save your money people and just hit the food court!"}
{"text":"Food was alright, we got the seafood pasta. It was tasty but it had maybe a couple tiny pieces of salmon and three or four shrimps. Maybe my girlfriend ate them all. It was about 23$ so I had some expectations. The dessert was good which is why I gave it some stars. We got the chocolate torte and the cheesecake.  The service was slow and there was only one other table in our section. We ate for around 15 minutes however it was an hour fare from when we sat to when we paid.  Verdict - Probably not coming back unless the conditions are: I have copious amounts of scene points and I don't feel like watching a movie.  Update: Just spoke to my girlfriend, told her there was salmon in the pasta. She didn't believe me."}
{"text":"Has a great view of Dundas Square if you sit near the window.  I won't comment on the food as it's the same everywhere, but our server Jenna went above and beyond to serve us.  She constantly refilled our drinks, and gave us a top up of chips when we were running out.  Location is pretty good, and wait times were reasonable given we were there on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I'm really a fan of this location and perhaps it had something to do with the time we went (aka, not busy). My aunt, mom, and I were in the area and STARVING was the state we were in. Having a less than savoury time at the Milestone's location in Yorkdale, my mom and I were hesitant to go in. But, hunger got the best of us...  Booths aplenty in this location so stars for that! It was not busy at all for lunch so we were given a nice window, booth seat. Our fabulous waitress Jude quickly started us with some waters, and my mom and I ordered glasses of the 9oz Pinot. The KIm Crawford wines, which Milestone's is heavily advertising, was all sold out.  My aunt and I ordered a perfectly sized lunch portion called the Trio: two small turkey sliders (hit the spot with avocado and onions), soup (that yummy mushroom soup) and mixed greens. This was just right for lunch which I highly recommend. My mom ordered the mushroom soup and beef sliders, which were heavenly.  In total, we three gals enjoyed ourselves immensely. Friday's and Saturday's for dinner are probably another story all together. It's packed every time on these weekend nights, and being so close to Scarborough Town Centre...BUSY!  However, if you ever want a nice casual lunch, I definitely recommend this location. A nice little mid-day break before continuing on your Saturday festivities.  20/30"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Milestones but at this location I met the DUMBEST and RUDEST WAITRESS.  I went here for brunch with a friend and had a feeling service would be bad from the beginning, when we didn't see our waitress for at least 15 minutes after we received our waters.  When we told her our food orders, before the waitress walked away, I asked my friend if she wanted a tea or coffee to go with her breakfast.....(why am I thinking of this?)  I would have ordered a tea, but the waitress left as if our table was on fire!  My friend and I asked for separate checks, and the dummy switched our two totals around, which my friend innocently paid for MY receipt.  When it came time for me to pay, I pointed out the error to the waitress, who just stood there with a blank look on her face.  I asked if its possible to reverse it.  Well that question must have offended her greatly, because she GRABBED THE TRANSACTION MACHINE ABRUPTLY FROM MY HAND,  mumbled something out of her breath and STOMPED AWAY, SHAKING HER HEAD.  Shortly after a heavy set gentleman (I assume the manager), told us the complications of reversing it, but we told him to void it anyways.  I told the man OUR WAITRESS WAS CLEARLY IRRITATED (although it was HER mistake...).  He was very polite, and it worked out in my favour because I LEFT HER ZERO TIP (I promise you, I HAVE NEVER DONE BEFORE).  I'm out of town, but if in an unlikely situation I ate there again I MEMORIZED HER NAME and would REQUEST NOT TO BE PUT IN HER SECTION.  I would imagine someone her age (I'm guessing late 50s) would know by now in life, at your job, especially the service industry, YOU NEED TO FIND A SPECIAL PLACE TO VENT YOUR EMOTIONS (like the kitchen maybe??)   BUT NOT IN FRONT OF YOUR CUSTOMERS."}
{"text":"The parking here is good. Huge parking lots and underground parking. But then.. you have to walk from the outside to get into the restaurant. When entering the restaurant, the hostess had no smile whatsoever. Oh well. She seated us down right away and our server was very friendly and greeted us. During the whole beginning of our time here, our server was very attentive and kept coming to check up on us for our orders, and when the food arrived, she checked on us to see if everything was good. But then.. as we're approaching the end.. WHERE DID SHE GO? Not to be seen anywhere. Finally, she comes out and she looks like shes serving all the tables. Understaffed?   Aside from the service, the food was okay.  We got Pressed Tuna Sushi, Tuna Poke, Caesar Salad, Slow Roasted Prime Rib & Beef Bolognese.   The best would be the prime rib, but still nothing that blew me away. For the Pressed Tuna Sushi, the rice was hard and when you tried to pick it up, the whole thing would fall apart. The worst part of the meal: Caesar Salad. How. Tell me how. Could anyone mess up a caesar salad. Is it their dressing thats bad? The whole thing tasted like butter. Literally, like they took butter, melted it, and poured it all over. The whole family agrees that it tasted like butter.   The only good thing to say is that on Mondays, it's \"girls night out\" where it's 4 bellinis, 4 appetizers for $40. Wish the server would have told us that one. We got 3 appetizers and 1 drink. Definitely over that $40."}
{"text":"Ive lived in the area for a long time, and this was my first time visiting this location.. the service was great. My sister and I were greeted right at the front door and given a booth seat right away.. I ordered the amazing chicken and waffles (which are only available until November as per our waitress) and it was delicious. Served a huge portion, crisp and juicy chicken fillet stacked between a sweet Belgian waffle, I couldn't finish it in one sitting.  My sister ordered the Cajun shrimp Creole dish but asked for it on rice noodles instead of the Jasmine rice.. it tasted horrible! The chef's changed up the sauce to complement the noodles so it didn't taste anything like the menu explained,, and they didn't include the mushrooms and peppers... As soon as we let our server know, she swapped it out for real deal and was so patient and sweet about it.  The dish she swapped it for was sooooo good I never had noodles like that in a long time... I'd definitely go back, if not for the good food, at least for the amazing service!"}
{"text":"I was here New Years eve for an early dinner (4:30). We were asked if we had a reservation ?   We just called the restaurant to see if they made reservations. The male that answered the phone said they didn't take them, and we should be good at that time of day. We were sat at a table 4:17 and then ordered our drinks and a calamari appy. The drinks and appy came out in a relatively timely fashion. The entree's however took FOREVER. It was a full hour before our food came to the table. The waiter however was friendly. Did his friendliness make up for the slow service (Maybe?). I had only ordered a burger with a side caesar. The other items were, a mac and cheese, rib appy, and a carbonara. The plates were quite hot, meaning they were sitting under a warming lamp. That being said, the food was tasty enough just not hot. The rib appy was very tender, and my burger was tasty enough. Will I be back ?   Not sure. Maybe in time. I remember we use to go to Milestones years ago while vacationing in B.C. Then we were so excited when the first one opened here in Calgary.  I guess you just don't appreciate something when its close by."}
{"text":"Goat cheese spread is my favourite app.. comes with cranberry salsa, fig jam, roasted garlic, and flat bread. Originally the roasted garlic came in a whole bulb, last time I visited it was cloves of garlic, kind of disappointing, as it was a nicer presentation before.  Service is always good, theres a male server in particular who is very sweet and welcoming! Always a pleasure being helped by him.  Good for a girls night out or a quick date, I like sitting in the bar, its casual and fun. Have also celebrated some occasions with family in the dining area, also very nice."}
{"text":"Tonight, I had the French Onion soup and the Thai Basil Pasta dish.  French onion soup isn't difficult to be average.  I was presented with a bowl of Luke warm beef broth with onions, croutons and a couple slices of Swiss cheese that went through the microwave oven.  After a long time waiting, I received the Thai dish.  Tasting it reminded me something from childhood.  After a couple of seconds, I realized the Thai dish tasted like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  This would be good if that's what you wanted.  Not me.  All I can say is the beer was good.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"In my opinion Milestones is a pretty decent chain with some pretty decent food. The restaurant is a step up from the Kelsey's of the world, in line with Moxie's but without all the scantily dressed female servers. (Which may or may not be a bad thing depending on how you feel about breasts and legs with your meal.)  I can't quite put my finger on why but this specific location isn't quite as nice as some of the other Milestones locations. I think it's the atmosphere/layout of the restaurant because the servers are all nice and the food is just as delicious.  My favourite dishes are:  Crispy Asian Chicken Bites Grilled Chicken Salad Portobello Mushroom Chicken Cajun Shrimp Dianne  They have a small patio that fills up at lunch. They are very good at getting you in and out quickly over the lunch hour (always a bonus).   The best deal they have is Wednesday Date Night. Definitely the night to go if you're trying to pinch pennies where two dine for $50, plus $5 off all their bottles of wine. They also have a 'birthday club' that gets you a free entree on your birthday."}
{"text":"My parents and I had to go to Holt's to pick up some ordered items. We arrived at Yorkdale around 5:30-ish and we were wondering whether we should eat first then shop, or vice versa. We decided to walk around first as Milestone's wouldn't be busy...after all, it was Tuesday!  WRONG! This place was packed. We were there around 6pm and there was a line at the door. When my dad mentioned we were three, the manager said in a voice \"we have space for you\" as if the favour was a great one being done for us. We were put, in my opinion, the shit-e table - the one table that is in an awkward space close to the kitchen, where LOTS of people walk by, and placed along some wall where obviously they just wanted to put a table to fill up some space.  My dad was really looking forward to having Milestone's Seabass, but unfortunately, our waitress informed us that the Seabass and Cod dishes were gone. We promptly ordered the Mushroom soup (yum), I had the Meatloaf (juicy) and both my parents had the lighter cut prime beef. Done to their request of Medium Rare.  This restaurant was not calm or romantic in any way. It's a very hustle and bustle experience. One thing for sure, their kitchen staff are en pointe. We finished our entire meal in 30 minutes. Our appetizers came before the wine. We ordered the Chianti and waited...and waited...Our waitress informed us that the Chianti was no longer on their 'new' menu, to which she offered me to look and order again. The menu I got was exactly the same menu with the Chianti...oh well, not every waitress can be creative with excuses.   By the time our mains arrived, we just got our wine. This Milestone's 9oz serving was HUGE. We didn't feel like dessert as it just seemed they wanted guests in and out. When we left 45 minutes after being seated, there was still a huge line.  Overall, Yorkdale lacks any special restaurants...only chains here: Moxie's, Milestone's, Picklebarrel, yawn, yawn. So, I would never, EVER, come out here for the Milestone's. But when in Yorkdale, you just have to deal with. My favorite Milestone's is still the one near my home right at Yonge and Sheppard.  16/30"}
{"text":"We ate here tonight.  Wife and daughter wanted the Porto mushroom chicken and it is a milestones classic.  We tried to get a reservation and they told us the manager said no 'cause we were a larger party - 5?? - restaurant was 2/3 full and they sat us in the bar.  Our server was great.  Ordered the Thai curry chicken and the server said it wasn't up to standards and ask the kitchen to make another.  When it arrived it was still not good.  Not a lot of chicken, starchy rice and general lack of flavour. My son had the steak and also said it was bland.   Great service, bad reservation system, and beyond the standards very average food."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday lunch - Ambiance is quite nice, overall service was good, now the food!   Ordered the signature burger with smoked meat... Although juicy and well seasoned... The smoked meat literally tasted like hot dogs!   The best dish we had was the chicken Penne pasta... Well prepared and we'll seasoned.   The worst dish we had was the ahi tuna tacos. They were so bland and unseasoned. About a quarter of an avocado is served deep fried as a garnish, which was bland, and had absolutely no richness - I could tell they used unripened avocados. Same goes with the avocado/guacamole sauce that comes on the taco. No flavour. Served on a cold wrap that probably came right from the package. Two tiny slivers of uninspired flavourless ahi tuna in each taco. I'd say this was one of the most disappointing dishes I've eaten in a long time, and the worse bang for the buck.   We were in a rush to leave so we did not bother complaining, so I hope the manager reads this and for you all not to waste your dollars on that dish!"}
{"text":"Attended a group dinner here just yesterday. The waitress was excellent and made us feel welcome even though a few members of our party were late. Hoewever, the food was less than stellar.   My husband and I had the Wednesday night date special (2 for $50). We started with the spinach dip appetizer. It was mediocre. We then both had the steak frite, served medium rare. The steak was cooked more to the medium side and was really not that great at all. The seasoning was off, parts of the steak seemed burnt. My parmesan fries were overloaded with cheese - making it hard to eat. We finished off the meal with the white chocolate cheesecake- absolutely delicious and the only good thing about this meal.  Overall - great atmosphere but poor food. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I often mix up Milestone's and Moxie's - not just because they both start with the letter 'M,' but big chain restaurants often serve the same food, drinks, appetizers, and soon morph into the same entity.   I decided to meet up with my boyfriend midweek day for something casual, and we didn't feel like going far from my work so I chose Milestone's. There are two levels to this restaurant and as soon as you walk in, you are given the choice to eat upstairs or at the bar (main level). We chose a booth by the bar and ordered beer and wine galore.   We started with 2 orders of the burger sliders (yum!) and sweet potato fries. I need to mention that the sliders, although ordinary in its conception and probably relatively easy to cook, was delicious. We loved them so much that we ordered another plate of sliders and fries (very healthy) and just chatted the afternoon away.   This is a relatively short review as we came to Milestone's for neither a lunch or dinner, but rather for snacks and drinks. And for that, I think Milestone's satisfied the both of us. Service was actually good in the sense that we were left to talk and laugh to our hearts content (no rushing us out) and with the occasional checkup. This was what we wanted; service that was there but not intrusive. In my opinion, as good as it gets in the immediate Yonge and Sheppard area for big-chainy food."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the bar area and the fact that this place is for drinks. I came here with another couple for after dinner drinks and the view of Dundas Sqaure is very nice. There is a patio which I bet is packed in the summer.  I believe the bar area is seat yourself. It is noisy for sure, but that only adds to the atmosphere. I had a 9oz Chianti and we shared some desserts. They have no problem in splitting the bill.  This Milestone's is located on the upper most level of the AMC building and I really had no idea how tall the place was.  You know what you're getting from a Milestone's but because of the lively, buzz-y atmosphere, and different types of people, this is a great place for pre or after-what-ever-event drinks. I never really liked the Yonge and Dundas area, but this Milestone's makes me like it just a bit more."}
{"text":"I was here because I went to the Toronto iPhone Tech talk.  We went out afterwards for drinks.  I'm not sure why there's so many bad reviews.  The waiter we had was awesome.  There wasn't a corking fee so we brought in our own wine and he turned his head the other way.  He even poured it for us.  We gave him a big tip for being so nice.  And since it was a bunch of us nerds at the table and we had just finished our conference, our batteries in our phones were low.  They didn't have any outlets anywhere but they offered to charge my phone in their office.  They didn't have to do this but they did.  Docked a star because it wasn't out-of-this-world food.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  I got the chicken."}
{"text":"This is a typical Cara restaurant.  Miniscule portions, inflated price, no staff, and all around bad experience.  If you are hungry, DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"I was recently invited to have lunch here at this recently redone location for Milestones in Mississauga. Admitedly, my perception of milestones has always been a slightly more out of date version of say a Moxies or Joeys, but will a way bigger menu. Recently the top brass decided they needed to get into their buts in gear to compete as they were spiraling further and further out of touch.  Across the board, Milestones has implemented a 180 and revamped the look of their restaurants one at a time, given their service staff new training and paired down their menu to serve only the BEST with some modifications and new additions. Now you experience the same amount of FOMO except over say 10 items instead of 60 (actual number of menu items not accurate).  For my started I went for the new calamari dish, much lighter, crispier and served with a better dipping sauce than before. Yum. Followed up I had the Sirloin steak topped with shrimp and crab meat - it was to die for. Seriously, I recently learned that most chains are sent their steaks pre-seasoned and frozen) and I learned that Milestones is doing everything (including their steaks) made to order. For a sirloin it was cooked to a perfect medium-rare and was still quite juicy.  Bravo for pulling yourself up by your bootstraps Milestones, you've renewed my faith that chains CAN change - while still providing a consistent level for food and service at a decent price.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"Selection is very limited on their menu. It is either pasta, fish, steak, burgers or featured items like stirfry/rice   It can also be quite pricy. Ordered an appetizer - spinich and artichoke dip is our go to app!  the mains are a bit limited had a lot of trouble finding something I was interested in. Usually the ravioli is great here but I wanted to try something new. I opted for the curry Thai bowl, not that great.... Only had a few bites and decided to pack it to go so I didn't put the whole thing to waste.  My hubby had the 4 cheese hamburger he said it was really good, had a Caesar as his side.   Service was mediocre. Seating and atmosphere was good tho! We sat upstairs overlooking the street across from Mel last man square. There was an event going on so there were tons of people outside. The restauarant was very empty, quite surprised when entering in.   The entrance has small patio seating and leads to the bar area. You will have to go upstairs to get to the dining tables."}
{"text":"Haven't been to many restos lately since our premier has raised the price of Everything with her new cap and trade taxes. Enough of that.  We recently went to this milestones for my mother in laws birthday,  the ambiance and service are top notch here, but let's talk about what really matters the food.  I don't like to frequent corporate owned franchises, because they only care about profit and little else and it shows in the food.  I ordered braised beef slop, with BBQ sauce all over it and a crostini? It's fuckin toast.  Tasted like tangy BBQ sauce smothered crap, gross and expensive.  I love how these restaurants get pro writers to do the menu. They make it sound delicious, but it's really just a bunch of shit that sounds fancy and looks fancy.  Be real ,tell us what it really is. Beefy BBQ slop w/toast for 20$ lol"}
{"text":"Not sure why this Milestone's has such a low rating. Every time I have been here, everything has been great. The service has been consistently decent and the dishes are standard. I usually go for the Californian burger which comes with bacon and guacamole.  The only thing I wish they did is to revert back to their curly fries!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the waiter was mean, he had a snobby attitude."}
{"text":"Decor is nice. Service was fast. Food was amazing! Traveling on business and in Burlington for a week, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came here with two other people and we asked to be seated as soon as possible and wouldn't mind sitting at the bar if that meant faster service.  We were seated at a high top table and asked to wait a moment while they cleaned it.... that took a good 10 minutes.  All I wanted was a French onion soup and I wasn't feeling 100%. My friend ordered pasta and bf ordered a burger.  My soup came out cold, I felt like they only heated the top of it for the cheese to melt as the actual soup inside was cold. I didn't need to let it cool at all to eat. When I told the waitress that she said it's not possible because it's baked in the oven. I had to take a spoonful to show her it was cold.    It was a really unpleasant experience - when she brought the soup back she made a smart-ass comment to say \"hopefully you don't burn yourself this time.\""}
{"text":"Was here Friday, only had drinks at the bar. Great friendly service, good atmosphere. Highly recommend the Napa valley Cosmo. Delicious mixture!"}

{"text":"I had a great experience with my boyfriend. It was our first time going to milestone and we had an amazing experience. Our server Julia was extremely knowledgeable on all the  items and drinks on the menu and everything she recommended to us was amazing ! I will definitely be back, we had a great night out. Thanks to all the staff at milestones!"}
{"text":"As with most restaurant chains, your expectations can't be too high. I came here with my boss and a coworker for lunch because it was convenient. Nothing was really popping out at me on the menu. I settled for the stacked chicken parmesan and it was just okay. Overall, the dish was very bland, and the chicken dry, and overcooked."}
{"text":"I've come here before and had better experiences but recently it's become terrible. Went here yesterday (Friday night) and ordered a burger and the lamb medallions. The service was terrible, so incredibly disorganized. Each waitperson that came out with someone's order didnt know which table it belonged to. We were interrupted at least 3 times asking if this or that was our order. My husband ordered a double of whisky and it was definitely NOT a double. More like a single. Their Caesar had hardly any clamato juice in it, mostly watered down and horseradish. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say there was some vodka in there... Somewhere. Our food took forever to come out. A table of 5 that sat down and ordered AFTER us got their Appetizers before us. My lamb medallions were room temperature at best, I ended up returning it and told them I didn't have time for them remake my meal before we had to leave for our movie (note we were here for over an hour and only ordered entrees). My husband California burger was charred and really just uneventful over all. The only upside was the fries out of this entire meal"}
{"text":"Milestones BRUNCH review! Ya heard.  Although I'm not a huge Milestones fan, one Saturday morning we were lusting after some brunch and took a chance on Milestones. We were pleasantly surprised!  Doors open at 11:30am, and this particular location, the dining room is located upstairs where there is tons of light and seating. (Elevator and stair accessible). We started off the meal with raspberry mimosas - DELISH. The sparkling wine, raspberry puree and fresh raspberries were a great combo (they also had a tropical fruit option). Then onto the main course. All ranging around the $10-12 price point, we had the Milestones traditional breakfast (three eggs anyway you like, bacon, fresh fruit, homefries), French toast (made on fresh baguette, syrup, strawberries and some sort of cream to top it off), eggs benedict (huge serving, delicious), and an omelet (they offered western of mediterranean accompanied with bacon and fresh fruit).  The menu isn't huge, and doesn't offer anything 'basic' like pancakes, bagels, etc. The servings are huge, but everything we ordered was done to perfection. I highly recommend the french toast, not too eggy.   The fresh fruit showing with the traditional breaky was a little weak, but other than that, we had tremendous service (ya I said tremendous), delicious food and a good family visit. Thanks for paying Mum & Dad"}
{"text":"I ate here twice on a recent trip to Calgary, but it was more a matter of proximity than anything else. Appetizer items such as the Spinach Dip or Breads with Goat Cheese are fantastic, but I found the restaurant quite nosy, regardless if the time of day. Also, while the service was relatively fast, I couldn't shake the feeling the servers didn't care about our presence. When next in Calgary, I hope to have time to branch out a little further..."}
{"text":"I Loooooooooove this new Milestones - miles and miles better than previous location at warden and 7 that we tolerated despite crazy horrible minimal location - this one is a gorgeous new building but built like an old Adelaide Alice Fazoolis historic Toronto building with 24 foot ceilings and tons of character - plus great flor to ceiling Windows on the second floor - food is spectacular but even better is amazing above and beyond service - waitresses should all be spectacularly beautiful supermodels and yet GREAT at their jobs - and I'm a HETERO female . Loved it so much  here again only a week later for New Year's Eve and it's just as awesome so far !!!!!"}
{"text":"It's standard chain food, but all & all not too bad. I'm kind of partial to the basic burger there, nothing spectacular, but good.   I tried the \"new\" pulled pork sandwich last time and it wad horrible. It must have sat under the heat lamps for a long time.   The good news is that my kids like the food on the kids menu...."}
{"text":"I work in the restaurant industry and I understand parties can be a bit of a hassle. I'm also not one to complain or ask for a manager, ever. But this experience left me fuming. We asked for our bills at 8:15... we are FINALLY leaving the restaurant at 9:30 because they took over an hour to bring us our bills, after we asked multiple times and our servers kept coming to the section and clearing glasses and plates during this hour. Why were they not working on our bills?   Food was decent, had the shrimp, sliders and garlic focaccia. Service for food and drinks was pretty fast and efficient... but on a Saturday night (restaurant was busy but not packed), when we ask for the bill, we should not have to wait over an hour. This is not an exaggeration. The servers even separated the party into separate tables, which makes billing easier than one huge table with 20 seat numbers to figure out. I know this because I saw their POS system and I've used it for the same exact thing. Never took me more than a few minutes to grab a few bills. Never had such a poor restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Fathers day was this past weekend and little bro and I decided that it would be a nice treat to take dear old dad out for a nice lunch somewhere a little classy that was still close to home.   We asked him what he was in the mood for, and his answer was a nice spot that was relatively healthy. After some discussion we decided that Milestones was a classy local option and Dad agreed he was in favour of this idea.  I must be honest, this location is a lot further north than I had anticipated. It was far less local than I think any of us realized. Located on the northern most intersection of Newmarket (Green Lane and Yonge).  Arriving shortly after the lunch rush we were seated in a great booth right away by the friendly hostess. If you've never visited a Milestones I recommend you give it a try. The atmosphere is trendy, an upbeat while the decor is very contemporary.  Their menu is very eclectic, offering international inspired fare from almost every corner of the globe (thai dishes, indian dishes, italian, american, chinese dishes etc), and being as such made deciding on a meal extremely difficult. While we tried to decide on our mains we ordered a platter of Thai Chicken Drummets, which were well cooked and wonderfully saucy/seasoned/spicy (had some serious kick to them)  We eventually decided on the following for our main courses: #1 - beef dip au jus w/ fries + potato leek soup (BRO) #2 - beef dip au jus w/ sweet potato fries +caesar salad (ME) #3 - Vegetable wrap with mushrooms, added chicken, with fries on side (POPS)  The meals were great all around, however one thing we all noted throughout or meal and especially once our $90 lunch bill arrived, our server was more than a bit pushy. She hovered and \"checked in\" far too often each time trying to upsell us on something.   When ordering she even tried to sneak in several items (my brother said he wanted fries, and she put in sweet potato fries. The one thing that bothered me was how she neglected to explain that ordering a salad and a soup was not a side but a full meal size (a price difference of $0.99 vs $5.99).  Aside from our server issues our meal and experience was GREAT, and Dad was happy, so it was visit well worth it"}
{"text":"Sucks big worst food ever.  The only people they are trying to satisfy are shareholders."}
{"text":"Came here with the cousins for a night out. I ordered a spicy Caesar and the coconut calamari.  I swear this is the perfect appetizer for me...marrying my two fave foods together is LIFE  I also loved the crispy fried rice noodles underneath, it's like eating crispy crunchy air....Weirdly good!  I didn't like the dipping sauce it came with...so I stole the FHubs' garlic aioli to dip in  only thing was service was very slow, and they forgot about one of our orders. But r was nice of the servers to gift us Stella cups as a birthday gift for the birthday boys."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times and their customer service really needs help. The first few times I was here, I didn't mind their lack of customer service but this time was the worst. It took at least 10 minutes for someone to notice us and seat us. Bartenders clearly saw us waiting but didn't even do anything. Ridiculous. As we are finally seated, we waited for another 15 minutes trying to find a server. I had to get up and go to the bar go ask them to get us a server. Finally server comes and takes our order. Not even a single apology or acknowledgement of what had happened. It took another 20 minutes for our order to come. We ordered the prime rib and the mushroom pasta along with the churros. Everything was good except the churros as it was so oily and over fried, yuck! Wasted almost an hour waiting here. Not sure if I'll ever come back."}
{"text":"Well well well first of all, it took forever for this no name waitress to even ask me if I wanted anything. She gave me a Caesar with horseradish which I'm allergic too after SHE asked me if I wanted horseradish and I said no. I blew up like a puffer fish rolled in poisin ivy. I could hardly breathe. I couldn't even smile and my bf loves me smile so it really interferes with my cuteness level. I'm appalled.  Her ignant ass didn't even apologize and I'm over here lookin like shrek half transformed into ogre form."}
{"text":"This is where you'll find me grabbing drinks after work on a Thursday night for the past few weeks. I feel like I'm slowly becoming a regular here. They have this summer special where you can get pitchers of sangria for $20. PITCHERS OF SANGRIA FOR $20?? And its actually really really good! Their mojitos are pretty good too, the pitchers are ALSO $20. If only this special was all year long!  So why the 3 stars? Well for one, their service is hit or miss. I mean, I've had good service, but I've also had REALLY bad service. Like so bad, that the waitress didn't even know she was our waitress until the end of the night. And I guess since she didn't know she was assigned to our table, that's why she was a little rude/ignoring us? I could go on and on about my experience. Also, they take FOREVER to get the bill. You should get the bill when you think you're done ordering for the night because it takes a good 30+ minutes to pay.  I usually come here after dinner with the girls, because there are so many other better food options in the area, and their food is not that great for the price you pay. So just come here for drinks and take advantage of their $20 sangria/mojito summer special!!"}
{"text":"Great service, nice outdoor seating, tasty mojitos, and a large menu.   This place was what I wanted to get out of the Stephen Avenue pub scene. I was growing tired of bar food, and this place offered a nice break. There's A LOT of food choices, so ou're bound to find something you like. I went on a Monday (for appetizers and raspberry mojitos) and Friday (for dinner and mango mojitos), and the waitress remembered me and treated me well. It got chilli outside, and my table was re-set indoors. I find the prices reasonable and like the location."}
{"text":"Awesome ambiance. There are so many options of table top types you can choose from. And the feel of the place is really good as well. Very modern.  The service was nice as well. We got help from several cheery folks. Drink selection was good and the drinks were tasty. Pretty decent beer selection, too.   The spinach and artichoke dip was very tasty and served with some good chips. The tuna tacos were way overpriced and not so good. They weren't terrible, they just weren't good, looked very intimidating- they were too big and were filled with too much shredded stuff in it.   I'd definitely come back and try other items!"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks. Not as much my style as the other Milestone close by, but still a pretty modern, cool looking place. Drinks were good. This is a great place to come for drinks with large groups of people. Like if you are at a conference in downtown Toronto, this is a good spot to come for that. There are very large tables. Service was better than average as well."}
{"text":"I've been here for Girls Night 3 Mondays in a row and always got amazing service from the bar tenders and waiters. Our food was quick, and we were even given a free round of bellinis and extra chips for our artichoke dip.   Thanks for great Monday night's !"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Milestone's in Ontario, I have been in BC. I remember it as being a classier establishment. The service was slow.   food Tomato gazpacho appetizer crispy chicken bites-4/5 Salmon dinner- 2/5 my server said that the salmon would be cooked medium...it was well done. I took 3/4 of it home for my dog."}
{"text":"Great food, ok service, unbearable noise level.   The food is fantastic! Truly. And the cocktails don't disappoint either (you haven't lived until you have tried their Bellini). Food options cover a wide range, from pasta dishes to burgers, etc. And they don't disappoint a hungry vegetarian like myself. Their deserts also stand out.  If you chose this location be sure to request a table far from the kitchen and away from any large parties, I find more often than not I can barely hear myself speak at this location.   Dig in :)"}
{"text":"Emergency Birthday replacement- original reservation closed for renovation but failed to notify us.  So we went back to Milestones for the second night in a row. The salmon shrimp salad was great !  Grilled salmon and shrimp were excellent and salad was huge.  The shrimp and chicken basil Thai was just right spicey, fresh basil added another dimension. Service was great after we moved inside due to a rain shower on the patio.  Our waitress found us a seat inside. She also got the birthday girl a free desert - a pecan chocolate Carmel torte. Very good deep dark chocolate granache. Turned trouble into a positive experience."}
{"text":"Its was Saturday Night around 8pm the restaurant was busy however we were seating right away I ordered the Steak with shrimp with Caesar salad, and some bruschetta to start. Food was really good and finished it all with some red wine.  great visit, Servers and staff very helpful."}
{"text":"I first got deflowered by Milestones when I lived in Toronto. I thoroughly enjoyed my first, second, third, the list goes on and on, times so you can imagine my delight when I moved back to Calgary and discovered that we now have them here!!!  The atmosphere of this Milestones is nice, the people were friendly the one time I went, and it was a welcoming place to meet up with old friends.  The drinks were good and my all-time favourite Milestones dish, the Vegetarian Thai Noodle Salad, was as good as it is anywhere else.  If you've never tried Milestones, don't be shy. Grab a girlfriend, skip the pint of ice cream, and head on over."}
{"text":"What a great experience at this location! I usually don't like chains, but this dinner was fantastic! Our server was so friendly and attentive, gave us wine and food suggestions.  As a past server myself, to me service is everything! It can make or break an outing. The app came out in a good time and the meals to follow. Everything was hot and delicious! Our server was very friendly, and did the proper quality checks. We will for sure be back to this location. We left very happy and full, our servers suggestion for my meal was spot on, it was their signature chicken dish, with veg and a pesto pasta"}
{"text":"This the worst experience I have ever had. I love Milestones but I do not like this location, not one bit.   We get to this location and the hostesses greet us and ask where we want to sit. Of course we say we would like the window seat if possible and the host tells us they are all reserved and I ask when are the reservations for because you know we were not planning on spending hours there and she starts to become annoyed and then rude. The other hostess seats us in the dining room and my boyfriend realizes that we can at least sit outside on the patio. He goes back to ask the bitchy hostess who makes him wait for a long time before even saying that the patio is free. The whole patio is free by the way, there is 3 tables of people.   We are trying to be positive, maybe the food will make up for it. We order the prime rib as our main and my boyfriend orders a prime rib slider which comes immediately. The prime rib however takes over an hour and by the time it came, it was brought out by kitchen staff. Our food was definitely sitting under the heating lamp, it was dry and barely luke warm. The sweet potato fries were cold. Oh and we had no utensils even we got our food. I had to go inside to find the server to get us utensils. She never came back to ask us how the food was or I would have said it was cold. There was no point of complaining because even if they brought it in to reheat it would be another hour. I had to chase her down for a drink refill. When she brought our bills, she did not ask if we needed a debit machine, she disappeared. We paid in gift cards and would have gladly tipped her if she had done her job at all.    My cons were the rude hostess, inconsiderate server and cold food. There was no accountability taken by anyone at this establishment."}
{"text":"I went here the other night with co-workers. We started with the goat cheese and garlic appetizer which was absolutely delicious. I ordered the ahi tuna tacos which were equally delicious (though the ahi was seared a little more than I would have preferred). The service was good as well.   My only complaint was an issue with the delivery of our wine order. They didn't have the Pinot Noir that my co-worker ordered and instead of asking her what else she may want, they just brought her a substitute. Then they started pouring glasses of wine without saying anything about which one was which. We all assumed we were given the right wine order.   I would come back if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Ultimate taco duo was alright, one of the cheapest non-appies on the menu at $13.75. Two fish tacos and fries. Good mix of flavours and there is some crispiness to the fish, which is a rather small fillet. The fries were a huge disappointment because they all were soggy. Not one was crispy. Four of us had fries as sides, and they all came out soggy. Like they were sitting out under a heat lamp as a huge batch for a long time. How is this possible? The taste wasn't spectacular either.   Service was also quite slow. Our food finally arrived, but our server got distracted with a bill and one of my friends got served his dish when everyone was 1/4-1/2 done. The complimentary birthday dessert was nice, but again, it took a long time to come from the kitchen to the table for some unknown reason.   I guess one positive point is that their group gratuity is only 15%. Ambiance was okay. The \"bench\" we sat on had ulphostering that was split apart in several sections."}
{"text":"I've been to Milestones a few times before for dinner and it was delish.  So I was forced against my will to go there for breakfast right when they open up at 11am, and I was since it was pretty early eating wise in the day, we just got waters with our meals and we both got small dishes.   So our total came to $37 before the tip. This is for breakfast mind you. Like $37 for 2 small meals before noon, are you fucking kidding me?  They should change the name of their chain to DINNER PRICES ALL DAY (plus tip)"}
{"text":"Good Food & service ! Food was fresh & very filing . My 3 year old loved the chicken fingers & our burgers & appetizers were excellent! Kid friendly & quick service, thank you!"}
{"text":"Okay, so kudos to you Milestones for grilling me an absolutely delicious steak! It isn't often that I can step into a chain restaurant and ask for a steak rare, without it being delivered either blue and stone cold, or medium. It seems as though the definition of rare is most often open to interpretation.  Also, whatever BBQ sauce was placed beneath it was a real treat. Closer to a chipotle peppercorn sauce than anything, it was so nice to have that lovely piece of cow accompanied by something that wasn't sugary-sweet.  Sometimes it really is worth visiting the chain restaurants to have a pleasant surprise.   Now, a word about our awesome server John. According to his history of service (which he willingly shared after telling us that he was in training) he is definitely an asset to the Milestones team. I was very pleased to have a new AND knowledgeable server who truly cares about his patrons. A huge Yelpy thank you from me!"}
{"text":"I love the friendly environment here and the good of the food. BELLINIS MY FAVORITE And the Chicken penne Asiago always good."}
{"text":"I came back for the 3rd time because they say 3rd time the charm but it was a nightmare again. I also wanted to try the new menu, some things were 25% off and that was a good start. Plus I wanted a cold $5 bellini which ended up being the star of the night.   Calamari was on for $7.50 instead of $13.50 and after ordering it 15 minutes went by and nothing yet....after asking for it the waitress thought we got it....I simply asked her joking if she forgot to punch it in....few more minutes went by and she notified us that they are out of Calamari....seriously?  You just proved that you didn't punch it in the system.  So about 15 to 20 minutes went by and no calamari.  I also think that they made it up because the 25% off menu was coming to an end.    I got a rustic chicken sandwich for $15.50 and the bum slash baguettes was as hard as a rock. The only good thing were the crispy fries. My sister pasta on sale for $13 and not $17 was horrible, tasteless, cheap pasta, and loads of arugula . Pretty expensive without any meat on it. My friend fish tacos were bland, and tasteless.   We ended up with dessert due to calamari mix up. Cheese cake and chocolates torte but nothing to write home about.  Save your money the prices are ridiculous for the food quality that comes out, they do it wrong every time and I doubt that they will get it right.  I'm done with that place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the salmon salad and my family was pretty happy with their choices too. Excellent chi ice,  if you find a table. We will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Milestone is a place I would consider a second rate BJ's restaurant.   Their calamari was atrocious. It tasted like processed food. There was no flavor and it was soggy.   On the other hand, their chicken penne Asiago wasn't half bad. Their seafood fettuccine had the worst seafood. Their salmon tasted as processed as their calamari. Their mussels were so ridiculously tiny. The shrimp was alright.  Their service was crap. Our sever checked up on us three times and yet not once did she refill our water. I don't remember her name, but Ms. Brunette server always had a look of disdain whenever she stopped by our table.   I definitely advice people to stay away from this place. The view can't make up for their horrible service and crappy pricy food."}
{"text":"Been here several times previously for lunch. Always seems to be a new updated menu, this one was spot on! Something for everyone. Our group all had salads exempt for one butternut squash ravioli (an old fave). Everything was great, fresh and tasty. The waitress was very pleasant and personable. Service was still slower than I would have liked. Especially for lunch time with only about half capacity customers. Definitely try the drunken donuts for dessert they are soooo good!"}
{"text":"This location is very nice. Lots of natural light and in the bustling downtown markham. It was my moms birthday so we were dressed up but we did not feel out of place which was nice. If you show your CAA membership card you get a free membership card so we got calamari. The calamari was surprisingly very tender! I got the miso cod which was actually delicious. My moms basil salmon was meh. The prime rib was good as always but they changed their onion frites to be more raw and less crispy, which I definitely did not like :(   there was a lot of flies in the restaurant, which I assume is because they open the patio doors all day.... It was a bit annoying to see flies everywhere but I'm not sure how they can minimize that as I do like the patio doors being open having been here before.   They also gave us a free chocolate ganache torte slice for my moms birthday which I always like when restaurants do that. Overall my mom was very happy so I am too :)"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at the Queensway Milestones last night.  Very attentive server, great food and wonderful atmosphere. We have been to many other Milestones locations but this one never lets us down. I look forward to going back again for my anniversary."}
{"text":"I LOVE Milestones and I'll admit it: lately, I just haven't been able to get enough of it.  When I was in Toronto last week, I ate at Milestones 5 times in the span of one week. I know - excessive right? Well imagine my delight when my date suggested that we go to Milestones last night. In hindsight, it was everything but delight. The Milestones experience that is...  I ordered the same thing I order at EVERY Milestones. The Veggie Thai Noodle Salad with no noodles (allergic to wheat), no avocado (too fatty) and no dressing (doesn't need it). Every other Milestones I have ever been to manages to make this salad taste like the best meal on earth, despite my modifications. This Milestones however, yes, *this* one on Stephen Avenue, somehow managed to make my salad taste awful. The lettuce was wilted and they hardly gave me any ingredients other than the wilted lettuce.  Flavourful at every bite? Try feeble at every bite. I'd go as far as to say that this was one of the worst salads I have EVER had.  How do you take a salad that is standard across every single Milestones across Canada, (and one that every single other Milestones prepares with such an expertise that it tastes good no matter what), and make it taste like crap? Well, if you want to know, ask these guys. They managed to take something that is usually perfect, and render it absolutely pathetic.  NO STARS FOR YOU."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend. Since it was right before lunch time we were taken care of quiet quickly and missed the lunch time rush. Yeah, no wait time. They have an extensive menu, a bit of everything for anyone - even those picky eaters.   Food was good and so was the service. Nothing that was wow or outstanding by any means but good enough.  We were seated, ordered lunch and had the bill all under an hour. Perfect quick lunch."}
{"text":"I had been here previously with my girlfriend and we enjoyed our night so much we figured we'd come back. However, this time the experience was less than savory.  My Moscow Mule tasted different i get that different bartenders do things differently, but this drink was off. Also everything just seemed bland the service, the drinks, the food, the worst offender being the Crab and Lobster dip!! Honestly the most bland and tasteless thing ever, it even looked unappetizing, plus the little dish it came was half full, it looked like someone had already eaten out of it and the neon yellow cheese used resembled cheese whiz. Needless to say we sent it back! They took it off the bill, the waitress wasn't all that appologetic and it just made me dislike this place, too bad because I fully enjoyed our first time!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaraunts for date nights, the atmosphere is quite romantic. It's reasonably priced and the food is really good. I like to refer to it as a \"high class Earls\". Same sorta vibe but the food seems higher quality and so does the service.   If you go there a little earlier, around 5pm you'll get a good seat and a quiet evening (in the dining room, I'm not a lounge kinda girl), there has always been great and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Visited this place 3 times during my visit and all 3 times, I had an excellent dining experience.  I especially love the location of this Milestones; it's easy to get to from the inside so when evenings are nippy like they have been this week, you don't have to step foot outside to get here from The Path.  The service has been excellent every time I have gone, and I especially love the decor of this place.  I asked my meal to be customized all 3 times I was there, and all 3 times, they got my meal dead-on. No problems, no issues, just exactly what I ordered.  The prices are a little steep ($15 for a salad), but the food is great and the environment is one in which you'll want to linger for hours on end.  Definitely up there on my list of places to meet up with friends during a night out in T.O.!"}
{"text":"I went to Milestone's to celebrate an occasion with a friend. The place has quite a bit of seating space as compared to the other places on the floor which keeps the wait times minimal. You have the option of sitting in the lounge, restaurant, patio (weather permitting) and even in the lobby just outside the restaurant. The lobby is where we sat and I wasn't sure if it would be nice....at the end, it didn't really matter although if you want to hear the music then you are out of luck.   The service was prompt and very attentive. I was happy with the recommendations as well. I started out with a chocolate martini which was alright...I have had better, much better. The gin-tonics thats followed were good. The flat bread bruschetta and asian chicken for apps were pretty good. I preferred the chicken. I ordered the lamb sirloin with was okay and actually a bit cold by the time it was served to me.   Overall, service 4 stars. Food 3 stars. This place doesnt really stand out and I wouldnt have a long debate between selecting Jack Astors across the hall or this place...they are pretty much the same."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday around 830pm.  Pros: - Nice ambiance  - Some food options tasted good.   Cons: - Slow service  - Overpriced for what's offered"}
{"text":"We were sitting here enjoying our dinner when I looked down and saw a MOUSE running around on the dining room floor, completely disgusted !! The server asked what we screamed for and I just didn't have it in me to blurt out in front of all the customers inside that we just saw a mouse running around on the floor just beneath our seats. Save your money, it could be infested.  Totally grossed out, will NEVER RETURN .  Management from the corporate Cara office recently contacted me, telling me that they would get back to me with further information in two business days and  I was never contacted at all. I waited over two weeks with no reply. I proceeded to contact them back and ask what was going on and they never responded. Very, very unprofessional and disorganized, terrible experience, will never return to a milestones location or ever recommend it to a family or friends."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service!  Recently went for a party and the waitstaff were miserable and lazy. Not once did they take my drink order until I asked and never filled up our water.  We also asked for a bellini- sans alcohol, and the waitress was adamant that they couldn't do that.  What a lie. When we asked for an alternate she rudely tells us there's nothing.  So I ordered from the Canada Day special- I got the poutine. It was disgusting. I think there was only 5 chunks of cheese churds.  It was so salty I could barely eat it.  Do they even try these menu items before selling it?  What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Here for brunch on a Valentine's Sunday to be surprised to see that it wasn't very busy. My boyfriend and I had the brunch special that came with eggs Benny, mimosa and fruit.  Mimosa came out in a wine glass because they ran out of clean champagne glasses. I didn't mind it until I realized how sticky our glasses were. My boyfriend had to wipe it down with some water and a napkin because he couldn't hold it.  Our fruit came out relatively quick but soon realized that we were waiting a while for our entr√©e. Looking around, it seemed like everyone else was also waiting........  Overall, I thought the unclean glasses and long wait for food put a damper on the whole brunch."}
{"text":"We've been to this place quite a few times, it's always a good option for a night out - i.e. when our parents are willing to stay with kids :-)  The food is ok, it is pretty average but certainly better than your typical pub food. 3-4 stars. Ambiance: 4 stars Service is quite poor (except for the bar): 2-3 stars Drinks: 4-5 stars Outdoor patio: 5 stars  The place gets really busy on Sat nights."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch on two occasions, the first time was a good experience with no complaints but the second time both my girlfriend and received dishes that were at best luke warm and her shrimp was undercooked. The eggs were a bit runny as well and probably should have been cooked better. You know you have kitchen issues when you can't cook eggs properly. The staff is attentive both times we visited but they lack warmth and seemed cold or distracted."}
{"text":"Came here late night on a Tuesday (10pm) and it wasn't too busy.   Pros: - Nice view from the patio.   Cons: - Pricey for the quantity offered.  - Tourist trap."}
{"text":"So I dragged my hubby out for another date night, and because I know he loves Mushroom soup I thought he should give it a try. We both had it. It is really yummy, but the bowl is small. For our main courses he had the Seafood Pasta and I had the Butternut squash Ravioli. He was not impressed, not much sea food, and I had to really look to find the Butternut squash. It wasn't my favourite meal, too many flavours fighting in the bowl. I will go back to my fav. Chicken Penne Asiago. Now that is a meal!!"}
{"text":"Ok, Ladies night is a great deal! myself and a friend have done this twice. pick your apps, the Bellini's arrive. you sit, talk have a great time, finish it off with our 2nd 'dessert' Bellini each LOL and we are good. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I don't think we could have had a more convenient location, other than room service, when we could walk right out of the Hyatt and into their front door. I had never heard of this place before but we joked we could be eating in one of IKEA's fancy little room setups. It was trendy and modern looking. The food was decent for the price. I had prime rib and it was really good. My husband had the steak and did say it was good. We had the spicy wings, which were not killer hot, but had a kick. My husband normally gets a side of mushrooms with his steak, but none as fancy as the ones we ended up, see the picture.   It was an enjoyable evening and the refills kept coming from a waitress that was very friendly.  I would go back there if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on a weekday with a colleague. during the weekdays it's probably more busy.  I had the salad with beets and added chicken.The food itself was average.the freshness of the vegetables could've been a little bit better.You may or may not be able to appreciate it in the photos posted.  I like the choices of food.it's a good idea to have salads and the selection was OK.there was a lot of menu items available at least.  The location is great in downtown.right on Steven Avenue.   The people working there seemed really friendly and overall it was quite nice. It was just very busy."}
{"text":"Must have been here a dozen times now and not once have we been disappointed. The Harissa chicken is superb!"}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner with the boyfriend on a Saturday night after work. It was totally packed, but we managed to get a spot a spot at the bar to watch the hockey game right away, so that was great! The bartender (Steve? Sorry, honey, you told me your name and I am the worst) was lovely. I sat down and ordered a vodka soda for me and a Shocktop for my boyfriend, who was still parking and Steve offered to just pour it as soon as he came in so it didn't get warm, which he did before he'd even managed to sit down. Thanks, Steve(?)! You were very fast.  I had the butternut squash ravioli, which was great. No, listen, it was great. It was so good. Eat it. Eat the butternut squash ravioli. I was emotionally compromised, by this ravioli. Popcorn shrimp that we ordered for an appetizer was really yummy too!"}
{"text":"Went to Milestones for lunch with my wife. We had 3 appetizers, a Caesar salad and a soup ... for $50!!!!  For appetizers, we had the calamari steak strips, crispy honey phyllo shrimp and bocconcini garlic bread, which were all quite good. However, $50 for lunch (no drinks) is a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Been here a maybe 3 times. All three times we've been seated and forgotten. Beer is cold, food is decent and service is nice when you get it. Waiting 30 minutes to order though is not. Conversation is nice with your loved one but really... 30 minutes I don't have that much to talk about haha."}
{"text":"Ordered the executive chefs dish of panko fried cod with fries. This thing came with no lemon on the side, breading was soft as if the fish was microwaved and the fries were oily and soggy. For $19 I ate about five fries and one of the two pieces of fish. What a disappointment!  My friend ordered the shrimp and steak. Plate was big and it was a small piece of steak with tons of garlic mash and fried onions. I'm sorry for $29 it's a rip off.  Best thing about this place was the service. Save your money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Milestones overall good.  But this location had some misses.  Dirty beer glass, checked my lips and I wasn't wearing red lipstick! The entree scallops was prepared great and delicious! Another miss on the espresso, no Biscotti.  I would go to another location!!"}
{"text":"Milestones is milestones. Basically a chain place. You know what you're getting going in there so don't expect a whole lot. Decent food at a above average price.  Unfortunately, however, there are some things that are unacceptable.   Please see the attached photos of my visit this evening. Even they do not do the \"dirtiness\" justice, as the kitchens were absolutely even more deplorable but I could not get in there to provide proof.  Will never return.   Absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"Food is generally ok tasting but this is not a family friendly restaurant. Cannot take kids at this place. Your luck of the draw but half of the times you are guaranteed to get a bad server with an attitude. This is just a chain so these guys should get over their attitude and focus on providing decent service to customers, especially when the customer spends a lot and tips over 15 pct. Also nothing special about the beers on tap, just mass produced crap."}
{"text":"Went to Milestones in the Yorkdale Mall and the service was good.  I found the waitress to be very friendly and helpful.   I had the breaded cod with yams and I thought it was very good and would order it again.   My bf had the 8oz steak with quinoa as a side and regretted it after.  He ate half of my meal because his meal was so small.  The quinoa was very bland, and he definitely could cook a better steak at home for a fraction of the price.    Overall it wasn't a bad experience,however, it is overpriced for what you get!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I visited Milestones with a co-worker for Dinner.  Upon entering I felt we had made the right decision though it took a bit longer to get our table then told because the hostess thought we had left :-(.  In the end though they made up for it with prompt service upon finding out the error and during the entire dinner.  I tried their new calamari appetizer which was excellent and the Seafood linguine for the main course. Both of which were excellent as was my co-worker's dish.  Contrary to prior posts the seafood in my dish were cooked perfectly and it had a good mix of shrimp, salmon, and bass.  If you are in the downtown Calgary area I would visit Milestones...they had good service and a lot of good specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"The service and food were both worth 5 stars! They messed up our order so we ended up with extra free food plus he gave the three of us $5 gift cards for when we return!"}
{"text":"So bad that we couldn't even order dinner . Nothing we wanted on the menu was available (cauliflower appetizer and veggie burger). However, our server handled it very well. We ended up having drinks and found somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"Customer service was really good. I've been here several times and I honestly have no complaints. Everyone is super nice. I typically order the seafood deals which is terrific and healthy but tonight I ordered the new salmon with orange sauce with veggies. I eat a lot of salmon and I am from the east coast so I'm used to terrific seafood. The salmon was cooked too well, it was not moist and it was seared so much that it was tough and chewy. The orange sauce didn't have the citrusy punch that it should have so was quite bland. I cook a salmon with an orange compote which is so much bette than this. Having said this, it is just one meal that was disappointing. There is an entire menu that is likely awesome so please don't take this one review as gospel - I've had good meals here. The lounge area is great for an informal date or to watch the game at the new renovated bar. I am always alone because I'm traveling and there is lots of space for single guests. It's a good spot and I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I can't help it, I like this place.  The food is pretty good and the service was excellent.  I love the curry chicken, that is why I go.  And the bar is nice.  EVERYONE was smoking on the outside patio and it was disgusting - I wish they would change that rule. So, if you dislike being around smokers, do yourself a favour and eat inside."}
{"text":"Sub-par food and service.  Server was nice enough but actual service has been slow last 2 times we ate here.  Creole shrimp good but too salty.  Prime rib tender but way too fatty- of the 14oz probably 3oz fat.  Mashed potatoes dry and not very garlicy.  I'm not super picky but when I eat out and pay $36 it should be better than what I got.  Spinach dip didn't have much flavour and some of the tortilla chips were rancid, also had to wait 25 min and remind server for our app and dinner.  I suspect that there isn't enough kitchen staff, not even that busy."}
{"text":"I went to Milestones on a Tuesday night for dinner and decided to sit outside in the patio. We ordered our drinks and apps ($4.50 bellini special on Tuesdays btw!) and realized it was a lot colder and windier than anticipated. The server was super accommodating and helped us move our plates and drinks when we told her we'd like to go inside for the remainder of our meal.   Since I've last been to Milestones (not this one in particular), I think they've changed their menu and added a lot more variety in terms of entrees and apps. I was surprised to see new dishes along with their classic Wednesday Date Night special and Monday Girls Night special. The appetizer, yam frites with 3 dips was delicious and we spent the entire time trying to figure out which dip was our favourite, they were all really good.   Entrees were also decent (the Chopped Salad was pretty big and the ingredients were fresh and delicious, the thin tortilla chips on the top are a nice addition). If I had more space, I would've definitely ordered a dessert as well, perhaps the Wednesday special is a better bet. I was also super excited when I saw the brunch menu! Brunch is definitely the best meal of the day, and my favourite so I will definitely be returning for brunch one day.  Prices are fairly reasonable considering the location.  Altogether, an app, two entrees and two bellinis came out to around $50."}
{"text":"Poor service. My pint of somersby was 3/4 ice 1/4 somersby so I requested just somersby in the pint glass and the ice in a separate glass, then they bring me my pint and it's just over half full"}
{"text":"I suppose I know why we no longer frequent Milestone's. Last night a group of us decided to go and indulge in spinach and artichoke dip (they have one of the best) and Bellini's (well, not for me) before catching Aladdin on stage at the Ed Mirvish Theatre.   We sat down and ordered our drinks and dip and those got to our table at a reasonable time. At the start the server came and was attentive - until after we had ordered our entr√©es. After that, we'd see her, across the room at other tables. I get that they get busy at dinner but should a server's tables be that spread apart? In once section I shouldn't see 3 different servers at 3 tables next to each other. That is not efficient by any means.   At 6:20pm we ordered 3 additional appetizers for our late comer friends. You'd think that the turn around time for appetizers would be 20-30 minutes at the most. Considering we ordered the Peruvian Burritos, Side Caesar Salad and Chicken Bites, it should not have taken the kitchen that long to get to our table. These 3 items did NOT arrive until 7:08pm. That is completely unacceptable. Mind you the server was more than happy to have us pay BEFORE all the food had even arrived.   Yes, I understand this is a chain restaurant. Yes, I understand it was dinner and they were busy. But at no point did the server come by to refill our water or apologise or even acknowledge the delay. The service was horrible to say the least. And had I the time, I would've spoken to the manager immediately   Needless to say, her tip reflected her lack of attention and unapologetic manner.   Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"What's not to like. The food was excellent from the appetizer, main dish to the dessert. The atmosphere is classy yet relaxed and informal. The service was professional and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this location, and always manage to order something different because there are so many yummy things. I recently have fallen in love with the risotto balls. It has the right amount of cheese inside and I could eat the whole serving to myself. They definitely should put this on their girls' night menu. The portebello mushroom chicken is a fav entree, but sometimes it can taste a bit undercooked, depending on the day I guess. For lunch, the spicy Thai roll up is awesome and very filling. The service is usually always on point. They don't have it on the drink menu but I always order the sangria. Its so refreshing. The tropical Mimosa is also a great choice and not too sweet. This is my fav hangover place"}
{"text":"So very busy on weekends! Go early and be patient! Decor is cool and the food is consistent. Giant parking lot with free parking. Great apps and bellinis! A little expensive though. Staff are friendly. Of all the choices are this theatre complex, I like this place the best."}
{"text":"The butternut squash ravioli was amazing but the portions are not great for the price. This place is huge and obviously the flagship restaurant for milestones. Service was excellent as they have full time staff."}
{"text":"This past October my wife and I had our first baby (see how I casually fit that in there), but after 3 months of child-rearing (is that the proper context?) we needed a night out. So dinner and a movie was on the agenda with dinner being at Milestones.  It wasn't our first choice - as franchise type restaurants rarely are - but man did it hit the spot.  Definitely of the swankier variety of chain restaurants, Milestones has a bit of Yuppie atmosphere, sort of blending the Keg with a douchey Miami Vice type bar. But looks were deceiving as the food was top shelf.  We started with Kobe beef sliders (amazing) then I moved on to a steak topped with lobster and shrimp while my wife had a fantastic mushroom pasta. We finished it off with some sort of Mexican chocolate cake that I'm nearly sure gave me diabetes.  If you can get past the cookie cutter look and feel, and are in the market for a well cooked meal you really could do worse than Milestones. I know someone commented on the slow service, but I have to point out that we had a really attentive server. I've also heard people say that the chain is really hit and miss depending on which one you go to. Well - this one was a hit."}
{"text":"Best Milestones I've ever been to. Shout outs to Christian for always exceeding expectations! Cheers"}
{"text":"Milestones is always a place where you can Bring different groups of ppl to especially with work functions. Staff are always great in keeping the food and experience smooth and timely. Food while they have change the menu recently some of the old favourites are still around!!   Always a pleasure to eat at milestones!"}
{"text":"The thing with Milestone's is that it's not very good. The atmosphere is nice.  Dimly lit.  I love that all the tables are booths. But the food.... Well, it's just not that good.   I have been to this location twice. Both times I had to send items back.  But I will tell you of my most recent experience. I came in for dinner last Wednesday with my boyfriend.   We had: The tuna tacos -  The tuna was good. If only there wasn't so much salad filler.  Whole lettuce leaves and asparagus completely over powered this dish.  Also, these were much larger than tuna tacos I have had at other places.  The garlic bread - We sent it back. It was partially frozen.  The squash ravioli - My boyfriend loved this. it was too rich for me.  The fish entr√©e - my apologies. I can not remember what type of fish it was, but It wasn't salmon and it was $22. This was cooked to perfection but under seasoned. It had NO FLAVOUR. It was served on a pile of quinoa with WHOLE chick peas throughout, and veggies on the side. There was no reason for that many chickpeas in my quinoa. The flavours and textures made no sense.   Milestones is good if you are looking for a reasonable place to eat with a nice atmosphere. We were there on Wednesday, which offers a\"date night\" menu: a shared app, 2 entrees, and a shared dessert for $50.   However, if you consider your palette to be in any way discerning, this is NOT the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"Milestone's opened up a new location at the (useless) Yonge & Dundas Square location. Once you've reached the third and final set of escalators you'll arrive at the beautifully designed Milestones (Whoever designed Yonge & Dundas Square LOVED escalators! The building is overpowered with giant escalators going in every direction). Architecturally it looks as if they've tried to merge nature with design; I really love what they've done with this restaurant design wise.   The restaurants gets good marks for atmosphere and friendly staff. Our waitress was friendly without being fake and tended to the table throughout the meal. However, as for the food it was below mediocre. I ordered the Sweet Soy Salmon. There was absolutely no presentation to my plate, and for a salmon dish to be over $20 it should have some decor to it. It was hard to taste anything other than soy as my meal was bathed in it. I'm 100 percent sure that the vegetables and rice were microwaved from a frozen bag. It wasn't just the salmon dish that was 'meh', other people at the table had similar experiences with their meal.  I'm realizing that these big Canadian chain restaurants spend all this money on design yet give up when it comes to the kitchen. If more effort were put into meals Milestone's would be an excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a bonafide eggs Benedict buff, anytime I see it on a menu, I order it. Traditional, vegetarian, spicy, thai fusion, it doesn't matter the style; I love them all. Having said that, it would be easy to assume that I'm hyper critical, fact is, I'm not. I've had decent benny's from all walks of the restaurant world, and enjoyed them immensely.  So when I went to Milestone's and saw it on the brunch menu, of course I ordered it.   When my dish arrived it looked pretty typical, eggs nicely poached, not too hard, not too soft, even distribution of the hollandaise, crisp English muffin and a generous slice of back bacon. So I lifted my fork with eager anticipation. That anticipation turned immediately to horror when I took my first bite. All I could taste was vinegar.  Now, I know that adding a dash of vinegar to the boiling water helps with the poaching process, but this tasted like they added a dash of water to the boiling vinegar. Needless to say, this eggs benedict was a real Benedict Arnold."}
{"text":"Service wasn't wonderful but it seemed we got there right smack in the middle of their busiest time.  As we waited for them to take our order I saw several people receiving this cute drink in a martini glass, so I tried it.  Best FUN cocktail I've ever had.   SO YUMMY. Its their twist on the Bellini. FYI It is frozen though and I know some don't like frozen drinks. Food was well prepared and tasty.  Fun atmosphere and if you sit by the window you get the Dundas view."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know what it is about this location but every time I come here my sinuses begin to clog up and I struggle to breathe. I'm allergic to dust, so my gut says that the cushion chairs in front of the kitchen must have dust in them. It's happened the last three times I was there and as soon as I go outside I'm fine.   With that being said, it makes me wonder how hygienic the food is.   On a high note, our server was super sweet and friendly and my Bellini tasted great!  I have to give this restaurant two stars because they really need to fix their ventilation or take a vacuum and vacuum all of the seating. I will not return if I can avoid it (hopefully I won't have any holiday parties scheduled here)."}
{"text":"I'm a gluten free diner, and I often have problems finding good food, especially in a place where I can eat with my whole family.  Milestones at Yorkdale mall is not only accommodating but well prepared for this type of scenario. They have gluten free foods and are wise enough to ask if it is an allergy or just a preference. I presume that would change the extra level of care the kitchen provides the meal. My server was very friendly and on the ball, it was lovely eating there.  The food is prepared well, looks good, and tastes good too. I've enjoyed most of their gluten free options and can emphatically recommend their gluten free strip loin and their brown rice spaghettini.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is the portions are a little small, and whenever I order takeout, something goes wrong. I've ordered takeout countless times and not once was everything exactly as requested.  Still a great place and a joy. And if they are preparing gluten free food alongside glutenous food, they still keep it separate. Kudos!"}
{"text":"This location is terribly unorganized at getting guests a table. I was waiting with a friend and asked if we could sit in the bar. The hostess told us there was a long wait. I could easily see three empty tables in the bar area. Since I did not want to wait and was extremely hungry I approached someone who looked like the manager. At first he said we had to wait. I then pointed out all of the empty tables and he then told us we could go sit down at one.   Once at our table the waitress helping us was amazing!  She was super warm and friendly. The wait staff and the hostesses provide a completely different experience. I would give the chaotic wait at the front of the restaurant a 1 or 2 star rating. Our sit down experience would be rated at 4 stars. That is why I decided to average my rating to a three.   The bar has a really good view of the city I would highly recommend this location in the summer or winter for the view. Hopefully you won't have a crazy wait time getting into the restaurant. We almost left until I asked the manager if we could sit at one of the tables I saw were completely empty."}
{"text":"WORST FOOD EVER! If I could give zero stars I would.  I was there with some friends from out-of-town this past Saturday and the 'food' that we were delivered could not be described as anything other than garbage.  My 'steak' was extraordinarily tough and stringy, tasted bad, was under-cooked, and horribly over-seasoned.  My fries were cold and soggy.  My salad was so disgusting looking (and smelling) that I couldn't even bring myself to try it.  My guest's meals were equally horrible but there's no point in going on about the same things; terrible.  Really so shockingly bad that it was hard to believe that it was actually happening, and my guess is that the waitress knew how bad it was since she seemed to make an effort to avoid asking.  Oh yes, and then we had the pleasure of attending the server's area to pay by VISA and Debit since it apparently doesn't work on the patio.  If I had my way I would have this crap-hole shut-down.  Really horrifically bad; don't get lured by the location and patio, you will regret it."}
{"text":"This place is gross. On so many levels. The only reason I gave them two stars was because of A) the service at the bar. And B) The view. It's so good and even thought I'm not a tourist, I love the patio here and the large picture windows in the bar. The bartender was very nice, albiet trying way too hard. It seemed like the rest of the staff were wandering around like badly trained robots in black dresses. I can't complain enough about this gruesome trend in chain restaurants. \"We serve shit food, but we exploit our female staff who still only make minimum wage for spending their shift in high heels and tight dresses in the hopes that the cheap tourists will pay them more\". So disgusting. This is just blantant sexual discrimination.  The bar was crawling in fruit flies. This tells me that they don't clean the bar very well and aren't doing much in the way of pest control. If I'm truly outside, fruit flies are understandable. But indoors in April?? They have a problem. And a big chain restaurant should not be having a problem like this. The whole bar area smelled of cheap sushi. And my wine glass was dirty.  I agree with another reviewer that the service is not to industry standards. But what can you expect from these girls who are more concerned about their looks and their sore feet and possible tips than serving people? I really can't blame them.  Hmm... maybe the bartender was the only happy one because he was allowed to wear comfortable shoes and not forced to use his body to make up for the shortcomings of his employer and still be paid minimum wage.  This place is so sad. They need to put a better restaurant in this space. I will not be coming back. In fact, I think I might be staging a boycott of all restaurants that exploit their female staff."}
{"text":"I came here during new years eve and couples times before as well. The atmosphere is relaxing with friendly service. I highly suggest to make reservations ahead of time during busy hours such as dinner time or weekend because seats can fill up quickly. Environment is kept clean and tidy. Music level is average. As for the food, I ordered the 8 oz. (medium-rare) steak however it came out burnt and super dry so I told the waitress and they brought out another one which was much better. Compared to other locations, this one is busier so be prepared to be patient because it does take more time than the usual and I also had to remind the waitress a couples of times. I highly recommend to avoid large groups. Other than that, servers were super friendly and polite."}
{"text":"Used to come here every Saturday night. They ended up changing their menu and taking off most of the steaks, and changing the quality of the ones they kept on the menu. But we really liked most of the servers, so we tried coming back a few times.  We decided to try it out again on Oct 29, because the prime rib is still very good. Unfortunately, we happened to get the one server who's not-so-good, brought our wine, and ordered our appetizers, but neglected to inform us that the prime-rib was sold out. He then claimed that it always sells out early! This was the first time that's happened to us, we arrived at the same time we always did, if not earlier! Around 7pm I believe. Anyway, he should have told us it was sold out when we sat down, as the rest of the servers will inform you what it's sitting at (rare, medium-rare, etc) when you sit down.  So we had to pay for overpriced appetizers and a bottle of wine, just to go somewhere else.  I give 2 stars because, like I said most of the servers are great! Their new menu is bad, and there's maybe 2 servers to stay away from. The goat cheese platter is very very good, but extremely overpriced."}
{"text":"With the closing of one Milestones on the street, comes another just down the street. Makes sense that they wouldn't need 2 different locations in the same intersection.   Must say that this location is a lot nicer though. With nicer flooring, nicer seating, and nicer lighting, almost every aspect seems to be modern. The decor is a little on the simpler side, but simplicity isn't always a bad thing. I did notice that the floors were very smooth, which caused the chairs and tables to move around freely. May be a little unsafe when you aren't paying attention and 'miss' your chair or kick the table.   With a new location, they have up-ed heir menu game as well. We were lucky enough to visit during a new menu promotion and got 25% off! My friends and I shared the Captain's Coconut Calamari and the Mile High Chorizo Fries, and we each got either the Roasted Field Mushroom Gemelli Pasta or the Pest Chicken Penne Asiago. The calamari was quite good, with a delicious dipping sauce for it and hints if Indian spices. The fries were definitely different, made with a poutine in mind, but with chorizo and and egg on top. The onions ended up a bit sweet towards the end, but very flavourful.  The pastas were both quite good. The gemelli was light, yet flavourful, but the ingredients were chopped a little on the larger side. My friend felt like she was eating leaves with the size of the shallots.  The penne was great with a nice balance in the flavours. Nice chunks of chicken as well.  For dessert, we shared the Drunken Donuts and they were absolutely amazing. They came with 3 dipping sauces (lemon, coffee, and caramel) which made each bite a different experience, but it was still delicious as is.   Service was amazing, even though we came quite late at night. Very attentive and made sure everything worked out nicely.   Definitely an upgrade from the old location to this one. Makes me want to go to Milestones a little more now. Check it out."}
{"text":"Wow this food was bad. We got the seafood pasta and the goat cheese and beet salad. The pasta noodles were as soggy as the salad's quinoa. Staff was fine but I'm not paying for an unenjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at 12:30 p.m. for lunch. I had a reservation, but it was not needed considering the place was fairly empty. The atmosphere is very comfortable; however, the service was simply okay - our waitress did not check up on us often, and the glass of water I was given had several coffee stains all over it.   APPETIZER: Mediterranean Goat Cheese Platter *recommend*  This dish was absolutely DELICIOUS! My friend and I wanted to order another plate because it was just that delicious! The bread was nicely crisp on the edges and soft on the interior. The best part about this dish for me was by far the fig jam - I'm not sure whether it's made in-house or not, but it is a perfect match with the savoury goat cheese provided. The mini side salad on this dish however was extremely sour (probably due to too much vinaigrette).  MAIN: Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad  Having created high expectations for this dish based on the deliciousness of the appetizer, I was a tad disappointed with this salad. While it was a good portion size, the dressing used was relatively sweet, causing me to search for goat cheese pieces to counteract it. In general however, the quinoa was cooked nicely, and the blueberries added a refreshing taste to the dish."}
{"text":"My experience at Milestones was fine. I ordered the Caesar with grilled chicken. The chicken was flavorful, but a small portion. The salad was good, but not special, though it was a nice size. The service was lackluster. I wanted a place near the movie theatre, but will select another next time as there seem to be more inspiring options nearby."}
{"text":"just got steak with shrimp and crab on top with a lobster butter over it and masha on side ! it was a mess ! the wife had seafood pasta and noodles were over cooked ! No bread with meals and nothing complimentary!! won't be back they can't beat the keg ! I know why u get in fast here because the portions r tiny also"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple times before and always ordered the prime rib (yum!).   Un has never been as good as other locations like downtown. I ordered a regular sized medium rare prime rib with curly fries. My girlfriend got the same thing but in small rather than regular size. We got our food pretty quickly but ended up receiving our prime ribs done as medium instead of medium rare. The sizes of our prime ribs were the same as well, even though hers should have been smaller.  Anyway, we asked for them to take it back and make it again but as medium rare. We got the second attempt back and it was better, but it was too rare in the center. I gave up and ate it anyway.  I was unimpressed with the quality of food. I'm not a picky eater at all, but this just wasn't right. I felt sorry for the waitress for having to deal with this - she was kind and helped fix up our orders.  Next time if i'm craving for prime rib, i'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This review is only for drinks... Me and the Mrs. were in Toronto for the weekend and decided to explore the PATH from Yonge and Front E. We finally came out of Eaton Center Mall and the first thing I saw was the Milestone's Grill & Bar.. I was very thirsty! Thirsty for some BEER! Milestone's had some specials going on for beer. $5 Stella's! That was a no brainer for us!  Mrs. tried the Original Bellini and after 2 of them, she was in her happy zone!  Ambiance was really nice and our server/waitress was really friendly! Ensured that we had a really nice experience!! 1 star specifically for her!"}
{"text":"I don't usually rate a chain at five stars, just on principle, but this spot has out-performed so many other restaurants that I want to give it its due.  I've been here a few times now with a friend who has some food allergies and is disabled. This spot has always been very considerate in where it seats us when they see I am with a friend using a cane. They have always taken her food allergies seriously, too (unlike the Kelsey's in the same plaza). In fact, last time we were there the manager came out with an ingredient book and went over it with my companion to ensure there were no dangerous items in the food, so that we could relax and enjoy.   Our server, a guy whose name I *think* was Chris, is the same one we'd had the previous time and he even remembered us despite the fact it had been a couple of months since our last visit. That felt really good!  The food at Milestones is always quality. I haven't had anything here I have disliked before that I can recall. I should note also that the coffee is nice and strong, just how I like it.   If you are in this area I encourage you to give this restaurant a visit. They're good people serving good food and doing their best to make customers feel welcome. Chain or not, that's good business."}
{"text":"I am really blown away by the poor service and treatment. Don't go here.   My friend and I came to enjoy a meal on the patio. When ordering drinks, we were asked for ID, which we promptly provided (we are both 22 and asked often). We were told they cannot accept health cards as a valid form of identification, which is not true. As a waitress myself, I am aware that smart serve dictates you cannot ASK for a health card due to the private information, but you can accept it as a form of ID. When the manager came over, I explained that my friend and I do not have driver's licenses as we live downtown Toronto, but we have our health cards and I even had my Smart Serve with me. He made it seem like this was a policy everywhere and that it was our fault for not having drivers' licenses. I have never been so insulted nor felt so attacked.   If Milestones has changed their policy to need two forms of identification, that is their prerogative, but they will have many problems with people in the city not having drivers' licenses, and they should not make the guest feel responsible for the change in policy.  If the LCBO accepts my health care, why is Milestones making me feel awful for the same thing?"}
{"text":"Hmm... this place is A-OK.  There's so much choice downtown and in the immediate area in the Entertainment District that Milestone's would not be on the top of my list.  Relative to the area, it lacks character.  It is definitely a safe choice for large groups and consistency.  As a personal preference, I enjoy intimate spaces more than I do the cavernous area that this restaurant inhabits.  The food is fairly good.  I had a braised beef pasta which was spot on.  It wasn't much to look at size-wise, but I was more than stuffed at the end.  The menu is quite extensive.  There is likely something for even the most picky of diners.    Milestone's isn't cheap, but it won't take your whole paycheck either.  It's conveniently located in the Entertainment District, perfect for people watching with a delicious bellini in hand on the weekends as clubbers start to stumble in for the parties, and before you too join in the crowd."}
{"text":"Not much to say other than it was the WORST prime rib dinner EVER! It was not medium rare when it came. Medium which was OK but so so much fat.  Like half of it was inedible.  And the worst part they covered it with pale gravy rather than aus jus.  Was very disappointed as I had been there once before for lunch and had half-decent food. Done with that place.  Good luck."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this Milestones location. I came with a few friends to get dinner before a movie. Our server was nice and attentive. I ordered fish tacos with a side of fries. I enjoyed my tacos very much but the low rating is for my friend's dishes. My friends ordered a chili chicken bowl and the prime rib. They were both very disappointed. The prime rib came out COLD and when we told the server, she simply took it back, and came back out with the same plate a few minutes later. The chili chicken bowl was small and was not worth the price. Wasn't too impressed with our experience here."}
{"text":"We visited this Milestones location for a quick late lunch on a weekday.  Quite typical for a Milestones restaurant.  Atmosphere: 4/5 pretty relaxed as the restaurant was pretty quiet since lunch hour was almost over.  It was not too loud or quiet and we were able to work on the computer and talk a bit while eating.  Food: 3.5/5  I had the roasted beet and goat cheese salad minus the goat cheese and added a chicken breast.  It was an appropriate portion size for a late lunch and had lots of beets and pecans which I liked.  Also lots of other options which are quite standard on the Milestones menu.  Service: 3/5  We were seated quickly but probably because of the time of day, our server was rushing us a bit with ordering and the bill.  Otherwise, food arrived reasonably quickly and satisfactory.  Price: 3/5  I thought price was still a little high for amount / type of food  Overall, it was what I expected from having visited other Milestones restaurants.  Lots of options on the menu for different times of day."}
{"text":"The service is good.  The ambiance is reasonable.  One should stick to the standard North American cuisine, though.  The Thai noodle dish is not good.  The Cajun dish is marginally better."}
{"text":"I came to Milestones because I had a gift card from there. Last time I had come here I had tried the butternut squash ravioli which was really weird tasting and I basically had to force it down...maybe I got a rotten batch...or maybe it's just naturally gross here. Either way, I wasn't going to let that one time ruin my experience here so I decided to go back with my boyfriend.  The hostess as the front was super nice and got us seated right away. We came around 4:30 on a Friday night so it wasn't busy yet. Everything on the menu looked really good, although it was super pricey I found...My boyfriend and I both commented on the pricey-ness and instantly began looking at the cheapest items on the menu hahah. Anyways, my boyfriend got the Ceasar salad with chicken. It was big and enough to fill him up, he complained that he didn't like how big and crunchy the croutons were, but I tried them and actually really enjoyed them. You could tell they were fresh! I had the gluten-free spaghatenni which had goat cheese in it and was delicious.   One thing that I didn't like with their gluten free menu was that it stated \"cross contamination may occur\". I'm not celiac, but my mom is, and like many allergies, if cross contamination occurs she will get very sick. What is the point of having a gluten free menu if the customers can't trust it to be gluten free...how hard is it to make sure that cross contamination doesn't occur with one dish? I've worked in a restaraunt before and it's not hard to ensure that cross contamination doesn't occur.   The food was pretty good and the portions were good. I was full after half my meal and packed it up. The gluten free noodles were pretty good too, I couldn't even tell they were gluten free. I also had chunks of tomatoes in my dish which I liked because they tasted pretty fresh. My boyfriends salad was a normal ceasar salad. Nothing special.   The one thing that put me off was that our server didn't come check up on us ONCE. Not even to ask if we were enjoying our food. It wasn't busy at all in the place so she had no excuse. She was friendly, but you could tell she wasn't going out of her way to be extra nice to her customers.  I don't think I'll really be back to this place just because I feel like I can have the same quality of food for a better price elsewhere. It ended up costing around 40$ for the two of us - (two entrees plus one orange juice) and I just feel like I could have found a similar spaghetinni and ceasar salad somewhere else for half the price."}
{"text":"To celebrate some new people on our team and say good-bye to a co-worker, a large group of us went out to Milestone's for lunch. We were seated in a semi-private room in the back with a long table accommodating our party of 12. But also in the room was another large group. The restaurant was packed during the lunch hour and the noise from the front combined with all the people in our back room made it extremely difficult to have much of a conversation with anyone other than the person sitting beside you. Too bad since I didn't get to chat with the new people.  Our server was pretty attentive and brought out our drinks quickly, except for the Pelligrino our manager ordered. I think the server actually forgot although she said they had to go to the other bar to get it. \"Is the bar in another part of town?\" my manager asked. ha ha ha   Our food arrived in good time and the portions seem quite large. I ordered the southwestern chicken salad. It didn't look pretty. Not to mention, I couldn't find much chicken in it. Some others ordered chicken caesar salad and they had these nice large grilled chicken breasts on top. The chicken in my salad was buried at the bottom. It was as if the chicken ran through my salad and landed on my co-worker's plate. We were all fussing over my lack of chicken and the waitress asked if she could get me more chicken. No need to twist my arm! Anyways, I can't say I was impressed with my salad. Presentation was lacking. It was basically iceberg lettuce, some chicken, tortilla strips and some boring dressing. Very disappointing. Would not recommend this one.  Two co-workers had the chicken salad wraps. Yes it seems chicken was the order of the day! They were enjoying them until one noticed some strange dried up herb or something on a piece of lettuce. It freaked her out as she thought  it was spider. Eeeek!  The service was good but the food let me down. I've eaten here before and remember it being great. Oh that was a few years ago. Not sure what the heck has happened since."}
{"text":"Ok food for a bite while on lunch.  Outdoor terrace on a  pedestrian street gives it an extra half-star  Milestone's seems to try so hard to be cool and trendy, bringing foods from different parts of the world to one settings (What is beef bucatini, harissa chicken and Thai coconut curry doing next to steak and burgers?)  It's hit and miss, but works for a large group with different tastes"}
{"text":"We have been coming here at least 15 times a year for the last 8 years we've lived in the area.  The staff is a bit older than most restaurants therefore for us the service has been mature and mistake free.  There are a small number of foods we stick to when we come so I can't recommend many other than the goat cheese appetizer which is excellent and the salads are great.  This place isn't really for families with young children. The customers are usually a bit older and the prices higher than average. I've found that if a restaurant has young staff and lower prices the food isn't as good and service below par in my experience anyway.  I think that after coming here many many times without any complaints is a blessing indeed! We go to many other restaurants also but with a less favourable experience."}
{"text":"I came to this location last night as I was recently at the queensway location and loved the food!  So I had a craving for it again and thought i would try the heartland location closer to home, boy was I disappointed.  Being a pregnant woman and not have your craving satisfied really sucks.    I ordered the exact same thing I did from the queensway location and got the California burger, supreme fries and spinach dip as an app.  Firstly, the supreme fries weren't hot as if it was sitting at the window for awhile before brought to the table and it's supposed to be served with waffle fries but they used regular cut fries instead.  The tortilla chips for the spinach dip were stale and my burger lacked flavour and the candied bacon that was supposed to be in the burger tasted like plain bacon.  The service was good and our server was very pleasant.  They had a DJ there for the Canada Day party, but the music was extremely way too loud even if you were in the dining area.  I couldn't even hear my friends across the table and it was just not enjoyable.  I even asked the server why the music was so loud and all she stated was that it was due to their Canada Day party...just didn't make sense to have it that loud with people trying to have conversations at their table.  I may or may not go here again, I just didn't enjoy my food as much as I did at the other queensway location and possibly because it was busy, I just think it could have been better."}
{"text":"I've been to this Milestones a few times (think this was the 4th time) and normally I have no complaints. The food is great, the service is great and the prices are decent.   On our last visit we got stuck with the absolute worst hostess. She was rude, unhelpful and giving out wrong information. We contemplated leaving but ultimately stayed. As someone in our party commented, why have someone like that at the front representing your whole business?   Once we finally got seated on the patio we then had to wait ages to have our order taken. Mind you this is a regular Thursday evening with a half empty restaurant.   We ended up with some drinks and desserts that were just fine.   I give it a 4 based on my combined experiences but this visit itself is barely a 2."}
{"text":"I was at a trade show at the Toronto Congress Centre next door and we ducked out to grab some lunch at about 1:30pm. it turns out that we weren't the only people with this idea as the place was packed. Unfortunately, that meant it took a while to get service, drinks and food.   I ordered the Mayan burger and told them I had a dairy allergy. The burger arrived without a bun. Apparently the buns have milk in them! This was fine, but I wish I was told, or given an option, but I was absolutely starving. The burger was good, not mind blowing, but I enjoyed it.   The food is decent and service is very friendly, but seeing as they are right beside a large conference hall that holds thousands of people, they might want to figure out how to serve a full house better."}
{"text":"After my first review, I decided I wanted to let the venue know about the poor service so I filled out and survey printed on the receipt and the GM actually contacted me, apologized, and offered two mains on the house.   I came back in with a girlfriend and while the food was delicious, the service, once again, left something to be desired. Our server was awesome but over the course of the two or so hours that we were there, we only saw her twice. Bussers ran and cleared our food and I had to go to the bar to ask for water after asking a busser and not receiving any.   I still tipped on what the full value of the meal would have been because the comp is not the server's problem (always tip your server based on the full value!) but as someone who has worked (and still does) in the hospitality industry, in attentiveness is not something I can forgive.   That being said, I've been there once before for the GNO Monday night special (4 Bellinis + 4 apps for $40) and am planning to come back this Monday with some friends to see how it goes."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my time at this milestones. They recently renovated and added a few new items to their menu.   The apps are super delicious and you can't really go wrong with their Monday Bellini and  apps special.  The calamari, nachos and chicken bites are super flavourful and has a great kick to it.  The service is also great and attentive. Milestones is one of the better chain restaurants."}
{"text":"We came here to watch a World Cup game. We got drinks and calamari appetizer.  This is  a new location, it's pretty big and has a nice patio area. It's nicely decorated modern, and lots of wooden tables.   Food: 4/5 The calamari tasted great. The batter wasn't too thick or oily. I liked that the calamari was cut in strips, it made it easier to dip in the sauce that comes with the calamari. The squid was cooked perfectly.     Service: 1/5 The service here was terrible. The waiter checked on us once, and we had to flag her down several times to get service. We didn't get any napkins at first, had to ask for those. The TVs also kept flickering, which is frustrating when you are trying to watch the game.  If the fix the service I might come back for the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  I was with several other guests for a birthday party over the weekend.  First of all, there were not enough servers to meet the needs of the client√®le which slowed the service down significantly.  I ordered a glass of wine which didn't get to the table for 45 minutes.  I also ordered a Caesar Salad which also took 30-40 minutes to receive and the butternut squash ravioli which took close to an hour to come to the table.  None of us ate at the same time which was awkward for everyone.  Secondly, the table had been decorated by a friend with glow sticks and masks and fun little things for the birthday girl.  One of the servers came to the table and said to us directly \"Are you guys dosing?\".  I can't even express how absolutely inappropriate that comment was.  I was shocked to hear this directed at us.  I hope their servers don't ask all of their patrons whether they're doing drugs (and loudly)?  It's one thing to think it.  It's a whole other level of bad manners to say it.  I was not impressed at all.  Nothing was given to us to satiate our hunger, no assurances that things would be moving along, nothing was done for us which there should have been some kind of acknowledgement of the bad/slow service."}
{"text":"Came here with a group for a Christmas party. Everything seemed nice - good looking place, good looking staff, so I had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready. Our group ordered a bunch of appetizers, and I asked about the dietary content of the dishes as I and another in our party have specific issues. Our waitress went to check with the kitchen and returned to point out the dishes that were off limits and the dishes that were \"safe\". Only she hadn't checked with the kitchen and the safe dishes weren't safe. She lied to us so the two of us got sick from the food. No apologies from her, she just disappeared and another waitress took over for her. Real nice. When I complained, management admitted that none of the staff involved had followed the protocols, and the excuse was that our server had been working there for only two months. Two months in and she thinks it's okay to lie to customers because management will back them up rather than provide more training? So, warning to all, if you have dietary issues, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to go to Milestones (Market Mall). We didn't have a reservation which didn't seem to be an issue. We we greeted by two hostesses right away that took us to our table.   When we were seated at our table. We were a little bummed out because the  table seemed to me very outdated and out in the open. What I mean by outdated is that our table seemed like it was from the 80's and the seats we bright orange. All the other tables seemed to updated and very modern.  I ordered the 8oz Top Sirloin Steak. The steak came with Seasonal Veg (Onion, Peppers, Zucchini) and a baked potato. The food was pretty decent for the price, It came out fairly quickly as well.   I gave Milestones a 3 out of 5 because it was an alright experience."}
{"text":"very nice restaurant.. we were a group of 10.. good food.. good drinks.. decent prices."}
{"text":"For a mid range establishment price point wise.. I was disappointed with how they peppered the entrees so much. I asked for no peppercorn lemon sauce on my steak and I thought it was still on the steak! The second steak was less peppery but not cooked to my liking. The potatoes & veggies were covered in pepper as well.  The server really wanted to bring me a salad while I waited but I said: then I won't have room for dinner. The manager came by to apologize and offered us complimentary desserts. I expressed my feelings about seasoning food vs. killing it with pepper. It should enhance the flavour of the food not kill it! Hopefully that is passed onto the kitchen staff!  The staff were lovely."}
{"text":"milestones is an easy go to restaurant for me.  tons of locations and tried a lot off their menu. The bruschetta app is actually REALLY good and so is the spinach and artichoke dip (big portion for this one and they give you a bunch of red tortilla chips).  My absolute fav dish here is the portobello mushroom chicken.  Comes with asparagus and a side of pasta, and the sauce they use is amazingggg!  Their side of mash potatoes is GREAT.  I LOVE their california spring salad.  The spicy pecans are a great mix in it.  However, I would not recommend adding the salmon for $6 because they give you the smallest piece.  Also, don't bother trying any of desserts, nothing special."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast alone; host was friendly. Was seated in a restaurant with maybe 10 other patrons. No one came to take my order. Staff all hanging out in kitchen. Waited 10 minutes and left. Not mad really, just embarrassed for them. Will avoid in future."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. It's a good place to go on a date or for a fancy dinner. It gives off a romantic hipster feel. The food here is always good.   I usually get the burgers or the pasta. The wings are also very good. Theres a good amount of vege options, about 20% of the menus. There's not a lot of variety of desserts, and theyre pretty plain so I don't recommend.   The people here are always very nice and helpful. We came on a busy Saturday night and still was able to get their attention when needed."}
{"text":"I ordered the 10z New York striploin medium rare. Nothing special about the steak it was frozen and cooked for medium instead of what I asked for medium rare . We then ordered the sweet minis and unfortunately did not like any of them . Just no flavour at all . Maybe it's because I come from a Lebanese family where most of the food is non bland lol but I'm sorry after milestones changed their menu their food has become flavourless"}
{"text":"Very nice place. I had a steak there for supper. Service is very good. Its next to the mall so we hung out at the mall after."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I came to Milestones for dinner but my boyfriend suggested we try it because our options were limited tonight on Thanksgiving evening, he also heard they had a 3 course meal for $25. Went In there with an Open mind, but the menu was pricy and options for the $25 menu didn't catch my eye. I'll start off by saying the service although friendly, was atrocious . We'd go for up to 10 mins without even seeing our waitress. The food was good, not great, but good. I probably won't be going back there if it's up to me. Not sure how Milestones is still kickin."}
{"text":"I love Milestones! Good food, great drinks, especially blackberry vanilla bourbon sour and Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad. Mediterranean Chicken is excellent as well as Moroccan Lamb Sirloin. I love their atmothpere and great service."}
{"text":"I've been to this Milestones a few times in the past for birthdays and get-togethers, and their food and service quality was top-notch. Enjoyed those visits, and for my birthday today, decided to give them my patronage once more. Definitely not as memorable as the previous ones.  The core issue with this particular visit was the food quality. Three of the four patrons in my party were dissatisfied with the food - the three menu items in questions are the Prime Rib Steak (10oz), Steak Frites (10oz), and Chicken Asiago. The Prime Rib Steak had a massive fatty chunk (low-quality cut), was unevenly done with one side being too rare, and was not tender enough for a Prime Rib. The Steak Frites were equally as tough, and were done Medium-Well instead of Medium-Rare resulting in a redo of the dish. The fries for both the Prime Rib Steak and Steak Frites were cold when the dishes arrived. The Chicken Asiago was also lukewarm upon arrival. Overall, I enjoy frequenting Milestones establishments but the food quality was disappointing. Many thanks to the friendly and prompt service in responding to these issues by the staff."}
{"text":"In town with family, ate here. Food was ok, besides the fact that they don't know how to cook a steak all the way through. (Not for me for my kid haha) and they charge u the same in American money as they do in Canadian.  I was Big Mad. Waitresses were very accommodating though."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, very disappointing food.   We decided to start with the coconut calamari which is labeled as a \"signature dish\". You'd expect a signature dish to be very tasty, but sadly, this wasn't. These seem to be previously frozen and breaded. The breeding is soggy, texture is off, and they aren't very flavourful. The portion is also quite small and the price is steep at $13.50.   My boyfriend wanted prime rib, which they were sold out of at 9:30pm, so her ordered the surf and turf sirloin. The steak was severely lacking any flavour, and was on the chewy side. The shrimps In lobster sauce were also very bland. This sad meal was very overpriced at $33.50.   I ordered the spicy Thai Basil noodles with chicken & shrimp. The sauce was decent, while the chicken and shrimp were average at best. The noodles were too chewy for me, so I didn't enjoy this dish.   I've given this place 2 stars since the only positive aspects are the location and ambience. I would not eat here again unless it was to just have a small bite with a drink, or simple bar food, such as burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service from our waitress. She was very nice and polite and the food was great. Except for the Mile High fries the sauce was terrible, so the waitress took it off the bill immediately without any hassle. I would defiantly go back again and recommended to my friends :)"}
{"text":"One of the bigger Milestones I've been to. I feel ilike it is a bit fancier since they do serve a lot of business professionals. Gives off a romantic, girls night out vibe. Very dark and sleek decor. The servers here are super nice, and was super attentive to us even though we came on a late night.   Whenever I eat here I always get a veggie burger or pasta. The butternut squash ravioli is the best dish in my opinion. The salads are also very good, love their ceasar salad."}
{"text":"I had the Salmon at milestones.   I enjoyed the moist and juicy salmon.   It was really one of the best tasting salmon dishes I have ever had.   The rice accompanying it was great as well.   The service is also great at this location!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The place had a good atmosphere but the waitress was very slow to ask for our orders. When she finally came around, we ordered the Spicy Thai Basil Noodles and Crispy Sweet Chili Chicken Bowl. Was extremely disappointed with the food. Perhaps it was our mistake for ordering Asian style food here, but many other places with similar menus do Asian infinitely better than this location. The noodles were bland, overcooked, and the flavour was unevenly distributed. The chicken bowl was drowning in sauce and the chicken tasted burnt. We decided to leave after barely touching our plates. When we expressed to the server that the food was below par, she simply stated \"everyone has different taste.\" Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My lunch here today was too pricey for what it's worth.  My partner and I ordered the Spicy Thai Basil Noodles, Portobello Mushroom Chicken, and a Chorizo Mozzarella Fritters to share, which costed us a little shy of $60.  Both pastas were fine - not the most delicious but also not bad either. The \"Spicy\" Thai Basil Noodles were not spicy at all and very much so resembled pad thai. Though the portion looked small when it arrived on the humongous plate, it was actually a decent quantity of food and included a fair number of shrimp. The Portobello Mushroom Chicken was a vermicelli dish with a pungent cream-based sauce. The chicken breast atop the pasta was a sizable portion and was definitely filling because of its slightly more tough texture. The Chorizo Mozzarella Fritters were actually surprisingly delectable. I highly enjoyed the smoky paprika aioli sauce that was generously drizzled over the fries because they added just the right amount of flavour that wasn't overwhelmingly salty but soaked right into the soft fries. We did find it kind of strange though that there seemingly was no mozzarella on the fries even though it's in the name of the menu item..?  And without question, service was great. Our waitress was friendly and smiley the entire time."}
{"text":"I love the portobello mushroom pasta and the spring salad....they're close to my house so i order take out and just devour it in the comfort of my own home. thanks for never disappointing me...  i've never tried anything else on the menu...any recommendation?"}
{"text":"Friday Night date night finds us here at Milestones catching a bite to eat before we catch the latest Marvel comics movie.  Ordered the roasted beet and goat cheese salad with shrimp and the steak frites.  Virgin Caesar was a pretty and tasty drink!  Beet salad was fresh greens, 2 kinds of roasted beets, goat cheese, and quinoa tossed lightly in a dressing with 2 spears of shrimp.  Delicious and hit the spot.  Steak frites was also good.  Steak was cooked perfectly although came pre sliced which seems weird.  Fries were crispy and delish.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Definitely worth a trip back next time we catch a flick in the hood!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mushroom soup and the Cajun seafood fettuccine and Asian steak salad for mains.  Soup was good, not cream based but would have been better if it was hot instead of a warm soup.  Asian steak salad was tasty and steak was cooked exactly as requested.  Cajun fettuccine was good in concept but was far too oily and while the salmon and shrimp was cooked perfectly the calamari rings were little nubs of elastic that had the living daylight cooked out of them.  It's been awhile since I had calamari so badly overcooked.  Service was friendly and attentive.  For the prices I expect consistent food quality.  Would come again but try something else..."}
{"text":"There isn't any problem with their service, drink and food. We had the most irritated dinner yesterday a Friday night.  Jesus Christ..... the most irritating visitors were fruit flies during our meal..... ....few fruit flies kept attacking our food and drink. We were not enjoying our dinner at all even though the food are always good there.  But extra flies company..... nah... it wasnt a pleasant dinner ....and very hard to get those flies out of our sights ....... one of the fruit flies decided to suicide by drowning into my partner's wine...... the wine must be too good to die for..........it was very disgusting and we were unable to continue to enjoy bon appetite... ( pls see the pictures we took)...sigh...what a disappointing dining experience ... very unusual..we always loved it and it is a ruin now  Service is good, our server changed the affected drink for us. Food is always good there. They know they need to work on fruit flies controls........... it is not romantic for us but very remarkable date night   We had a salad and fish taco..... the fish taco is spicy and mangos bring up the fish flavours... we had a passion fruit and lemongrass mimosas and red wine... the drink menu is satisfying the picky drinkers like us.... highly recommended their seasonal drink menu!!! Thumbs up but really.... no matter what, how much u could enjoy when some fruit flies are constantly visiting during the meal.........  Hopefully next time when we are back, they have addressed the fruit flies control issue"}
{"text":"Love the lit up backdrop beach scene when you first walk in the door out of the cold! There was a friendly hostess present who took us to a table and left us with some menus. Why, oh why do they always feel the need to place people next to others when the dining room has tons of space? Had to deal with some unruly kids for a bit but once they left - ahhhh, one can take in the ambience and decor and it really is a nice place. Dimly lit, orangey/warm tones with a touch of Oriental motif. The server was nice, knew her wines and the menu. We had 1 drink each. Hubby liked the fact that there were plenty of beer choices on tap. Ordered  (upon recommendation from the server) the chicken penne asiago - pretty good! I know the restaurant mark up on pasta is high but this is what I was in the mood for. I just wish it had been served a little warmer and I wish instead of chicken I could have had shrimp. I think it sat for a bit before it got to the table but the taste was there. The other dish ordered was the red curry bowl which had a nice kick, well cooked rice and juicy chicken morsels.  A nice evening out after some errands and if in that area again, would return.  Tuesdays are Bellini nights at Milestones - will have to keep that in mind as they looked great on the tray going to a different table!   :S"}
{"text":"Nice clean place... we came in with family around 530 for dinner. Thinking we arrived before dinner rush... we still didn't make it out of restaurant until 730 almost 8. Service was good but slow service from the kitchen. We got a complementary chip because of the delay. No dip.  Food was nicely served. If you are on diet, then definitely good portion. Both kids meals and adult main dishes are so small for us. Kids meal salmon was so small with big portion of white rice and seems old or not fully cooked. Not worth 9$. Adult pasta size is same as kids portion. Fish taco was good but wish they put at least enough to cover every bite.   Next time we go to this place, gotta make sure we have something before or going somewhere after."}
{"text":"I've dined here a handful of times, each one consistently bad (1-2 stars out of 5). My most recent visit really took the cake for  being the worst. Wait time was not too bad, and we were seated after waiting for half an hour. Service was decent, nothing to complain or praise.  After waiting another half an hour for the food, they all came out at once. Four of us in the group ordered pasta and three of us had to send it back. The food was cold.   I don't know about you, but I like my pasta to be hot, unless I specifically ordered a cold salad pasta. So, I informed my waitress and she took it back and gave me a new one. It was slightly warmer but still not better.   I won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"Our server was extremely friendly, bubbly and funny! The ambiance of the restaurant is nice for a date after the movie. However, the food is not up to par with its high cost. The kale salad and quinoa was about $13.00 for two cups of chopped kale and about a couple table spoons of quinoa scattered throughout. The naan pizza with chicken was better value. The fries were also pricey."}
{"text":"I used to think that these franchises were a dime a dozen. All the food tastes the same, and all the service is usually the same. But this one seemed a little bit different.   First off, I don't usually like Milestones. I was never a fan of their food. Having finished work, we went there for some food. They lost a star because of the appetizer. It was the dip and the chips tasted like it was handled by sweaty hands. Not my favorite dish..... the dip was pretty good though.   We ordered the meatloaf and the steak. The steak was nothing to write home about. What can i say, steak is steak. Unless it is an amazing cut, it all taste the same. The baked potato was a little bland because they just added green onions and sour cream. Other places, they would add things like bacon bits, or butter, but not this place....second lost star  The meatloaf was pretty good. It was a little spiced, but not too spicy. everyone enjoyed it.   Overall, the price and the service was pretty good. A dinner for 4 ran just over $100. They have a special on Wed where couples dine for $50 and it includes 1 appetizer, 2 course, and 1 desert. Overall a good value.   Pro  Was a special,  Meatloaf was good service was ok  Con  Chips tasted like sweaty hands Baked potato was bland"}
{"text":"Bad. Just bad. Ordered the following: Piri Piri Hummus - doesn't taste like hummus at all. Poor chunky texture. Whoever came up with this recipe went too far with their creative mind.  Butternut squash ravioli - overcooked ravioli. When the server came to ask me if my food was ok, I complained that the ravioli was overcooked and not al dente. To which she replied \"ohh that's how it's made. It has to be overcooked since it is stuffed\". By the way, it was her recommendation for me to order this dish. Wtf?!   As I criticize this place, bare in mind that I reside by Yorkville and frequently dine at fine Italian restaurants. I was extremely disappointed with the food and the service. Last week I was at a milestones in Markham (169 Enterprise Blvd) and their food+service was comparable to restaurants in Yorkville.   Save yourself and go to the Jack Astors next door! Or just eat at the food court.."}
{"text":"Have been disappointed by the food and service here before but we tried it again on June 3rd for brunch and they have definitely upped their game. Our eggs benny were delicious and service was on point. My only issue was with the patio hostess, she snapped at us when we tried to go inside as I thought she was just catering to the patio guests. That was the only downside to our visit."}
{"text":"Milestone's has constantly been a Meh for me.  From Scarborough town to yorkdale to this location. Sure, I feel nice and balling when I hang-out there. Good drink menu and low lighting and very fancy decor.  Waitors must be sleepy due to the dull lighting- because even with literally 4 people in the restaurant. It took them 12 minutes to get a greeting or some menu's.  For some reason or the other - the price of the food never matches up to the quality.  Maybe cuz this strip of Yonge-Sheppard spoils me with all the choices I want.  Milestones is my stop over-when I want to catch a movie upstairs at the cineplex and want to catch a light buzz before-hand.  once again...MEEhh!!!!"}
{"text":"Carl our server was the best. Breanne the bartender made my drink perfect! Service is great BUT even better is the food. Amazing dinner. Definitely if you are in downtown Calgary visit milestones.  We are here for 3 days and we may just be back ;)"}
{"text":"Their summer special menu is not too bad considering their usual too high prices for only mediocre dishes. On the menu, drinks are $5, appetizers are $5, classic dishes are $15, and special dishes are $20. My friend ordered the burger and enjoyed it -- nothing life-changing but a solid burger dinner. I ordered the chorizo fries (essentially a poutine with a fried egg on top and a special sauce) and the Asian crispy chicken. The fries were great but the chicken's sauce was some weird sweetened Thai chili sauce that I didn't particularly enjoy. There also seemed to be more breading than chicken. Two appetizers was actually more than enough to pull me into a food coma and for only $10 I was pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"Okay...for starter's not sure if this is the correct location. I think it is...but its a chain and aren't chains usually pretty much the same since they follow a standard menu? Service wise they can be different but the food is about the same so let me go ahead and review. I was in Toronto visiting a very very *special* friend a week or so ago and we were walking around what I call \"Time square\" Toronto and ended up upstairs in a gigantic mall at Milestones. We had to wait a bit for a table but it was a Friday evening, Prime Happy Hour time so that was to be expected. We chose a spot on the patio but waited at the bar and had a few cocktails...I had a Bikini martini. Strong and delicious...I wanted two but I didn't wanna turn into a wild women!! The boy had a Heineken on tap (such a boy)...anyway...we talked and played footsie at the bar for about 30 minutes until our table was called and then out to the patio we went. We ordered the hot spinach and artichoke dip that was flavoured really well...huge chunks of tasty artichoke and the only form I can eat artichoke in is dip so I was a happy girl...Our only complaint was that we wished it had came with bread instead of tortilla chips. I ordered a glass of the Shiraz (9oz pour) the boy had another heine...for the main course I had the Shanghai noodle stir-fry all the ingredients were fresh and delicious and the seasoning on the chicken breast was to die for...I secretly wanted to break in the kitchen and steal it! The boy had Italian Sausage Ravioli and wished he had ordered something else once he tasted mine. It was okay but mine was so much better. Overall the meal was great and the rooftop patio looking down over Melanie Fiona performing at Luminati couldn't have served for a more perfect first night in Tdot!! Loved it and will definitely go back the next time I'm in town...which will be very very soon."}
{"text":"After the theater, wanted to get some drinks and some appetizers. It was very busy there. Ended up at the bar where it was a full menu. Didn't even get food. The service there was SOOO Slow. It took us 30 min just to get our drinks. AND ONLY HALF OF US GOT DRINKS. She forgot the rest of the drinks and we just forgot about it.   Can't review the food as we didn't get any, but major CON was the service speed. I can say the service was friendly, but VERY SLOW."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Milestones... The one that I go to most is the one on Progress Road in Scarborough simply because it's close to my house.  I trekked out to Mississauga 2 days ago to meet up with a high school friend and he chose Milestones because he has fallen in love with the Harissa Chicken featured on their seasonal menu.  I arrived promptly at 6PM.  The hostess seemed frazzled and pretty soon, there was a line buildup of about 3 tables waiting to be seated.  I had to repeat myself once regarding the number of guests at our table.  My friend was running a bit late so I ordered a tea.  When he arrived, he called me on my phone because the hostess seemed to be MIA at the front, leaving the front unattended.  He asked for a glass of water, and after what seemed like 15 minutes, the waiter came back with his glass of water.  I ordered the Grilled Seafood Salad, because I love the way it tastes and have always gotten it.  High in protein, and the papaya and avocado make it interesting.  My friend ordered the Harissa Chicken.  I usually don't wait more than 10-15 minutes for food at Milestones, but that was not the case at Matheson Boulevard.  We waited almost 25-30 minutes before our food came.  And when it did, the disappointment just made it worse.  The chicken was dry, the rice undercooked, and I don't know if the Harissa Chicken is still on my DC's list of favourites or if it's now been shamefully removed. I did tell him to send it back, but he didn't.  He did however, bring it to the attention of the server, who then asked if he could entice us with a complimentary dessert, which we turned down, considering how the whole evening had gone.    On to my beloved seafood salad... I think the line chefs must've been snoozing in the kitchen because the salad wasn't tossed properly, and was definitely scant on papaya and avocado.  I will never come back to this particular Milestones again."}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of the Milestones brand however this location is much better then most I have visited. The ambiance - staff and decor justifies the higher price on the menu,  They do have some excellent happy hour specials for drinks. The bellini for $4 and house craft are excellent priced.  Also they had delicious sliders at $5 a piece and the same price for the fish tacos as well.  The sliders were delicious little pieces of steak garnished well. The bun was soft. I immediately was craving more and most likely will be back to get more. The fish tacos were huge and definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"We've had issues at some other milestones but Queensway has always been great to is. We come often for brunch and occasionally dinner. They're great with our various allergies and problems are dealt with swiftly and without question. They take customer service here seriously. Love their gluten free burgers and Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Never thought I would give Milestones a 5 out of 5 - but there would be no reason not to I guess! We just had such a great time last night, everything was perfect! A few of us were hanging out across the road at the Hyatt and were trying to figure out where to go to eat dinner. The weather was not agreeing with a long (or short) walk outside so we just went across to Milestones where I had been in only 1 other time for drinks, no food that time. We sat in the lounge this evening and had the best service ever via Janna - WHAT a great name, LOL!!! She really was a great waitress and was knowledgeable about the menu and was ever so patient with us when we took forever to order. The menu is just so vast here and we could not decide! She was great to recommend things as well and gave us confidence in the chefs that she acclaimed as consistent and creative. (she suggested the new lamb shank they were very proud of!) Ordered were a few drinks, seafood fettuccine (mine, yummy!) a burger and a steak. The food was spot on, soooo good. My pasta was not overcooked (which I am often afraid of happening as I can be picky about that) and the salmon and shrimp were cooked perfectly - the chef even added extra hot spice to my dish upon request. The burger was huge, an enormous amount of bacon and the avocado was perfect on it for a touch of creaminess. The fries were of the yam-kind, done extra crispy upon request. The steak was cooked to order and our friend had no qualms about paying $32 for this dish. It came with so much fresh veg that he could not even eat it all! Mashed potatoes (garlic) were devoured! All was well seasoned and we were impressed. The lounge never got too busy, the music was great and we had a fantastic seat by the window, watching the world go by. I would not hesitate to eat here again and I would recommend to anyone! Will return!"}
{"text":"I dont know why this milestones has low stars when service is really good. There were lots of customers when we went but still we were able to get a good seat.  Nachos in a spinach and artichoke as a starter is a good pick. It's better than the one at swiss chalet because it's a mixture of soury creamy and salty flavour. I also liked the way they presented their steak. For that i will give 5 stars but taste wise it's just 3 stars. The Keg is still one of the best place to have steak. I hope they add more pepper,salt,and flavour someday."}
{"text":"The view is nice. But it's pricey. Wine cost around 8 to 18 depending on the oz. it gets too busy on the weekends"}
{"text":"I just went last night and had the Cajun shrimp diane.  I was okay.  But I also had the sablefish with seaweed gnocchi from the top chef list a month ago and it was HORRIBLE!!!  I think if I have to eat at a franchise resturant again, I'll go to Moxie instead."}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy our lunch at Milestones.  They have a upscale atmosphere and great location being write on Stephan Avenue Mall.  My wife had their soup, salad and sandwich special and enjoy all of it.  I enjoyed that California Hamburger which was hot and very tasty.  I would recommend reservations though because we walked in the door at 12:30pm and their was only one spot left.  If you are an out of towner like we are they are just a short walk to Calgary Tower a must see attraction."}
{"text":"Hello Y'all   First off, I'd like to state that, Milestone is first restaurant that I went in Toronto therefore that place little bit bolder for other one's however I'll review that restaurant unbiasedly..   Restaurant is located right middle of Dundas square, which allows you get awesome sightseeing of all square therefore, If you would like get your dinner with view, I suggest you to consider that part as well. Restaurant will be best pick to have your dinner or launch as long as you do hang out or nearby to Dundas Square.   Appetizers are definitely recommended to you by waiters or waitress, ensure that you did not miss anything about your order. I ordered Cesar salad which was prepared well as far as I'm concerned. As main course I did have steak which was cooked well though it was little bit less cooked as far as I observed, however taste was luscious.  Also ambience was little bit dark to make conversations, more than that your eyes might close because of ambience...  Benefit; located in Dundas Square, 2 type of area, ( casual and little bit formal) , promptly cold beer service   Drawbacks; Dark ambience, you may wait 20 or 30 minutes in order to have your favorite seat, slow meal serve  Bottom Line; I think that might be good idea to have your dinner with sunset with your fellas..."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant and they strive to give you the same experience whether you're at one end of the country or the next. To achieve this they have a lot of stuff premade and prepackaged but there's still a certain amount of work that goes into your food.  The other day my friend and I went here for dinner as we were seeing a movie at the Cineplex right after. The staff was helpful, the service was reasonably quick and friendly and there was really nothing to complain about.  We both ordered the prime rib and it was good but... different. It was very tender, almost to the point of it being cooked low and slow. Not that I mind that, but it really wasn't what I expected. The sides were good although I believe there was a part of an acorn squash that was a little tougher than it should have been on the plate. The mashed potatoes were decent and still had those little chunks of potato in them which I like.   No time for dessert or coffee but the meal was more than sufficient.   Here's the thing. It's not a place I'd normally go to for dinner but it was close and convenient. But on the other hand it is a place I can recommend if you're in the area and are looking for something a little more upscale without having to break the bank."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is average. The pros are that it is spacious and beside the theatre. I wasn't blown away by the food, and the price is quite steep. Service was sub par.  - coconut calamari - meh, the batter was on the softer side - california burger - OK I liked the combo of the ingredients but the patty was on the drier side - chicken pasta was good but kind of overpriced"}
{"text":"Came here before a movie at the Queensway Cinema.  I haven't been to a Milestones in so long, but i really like the revamped menu.   There's lots of options including old favourites, and there is a gluten free section in the menu! You can also substitute any pasta for rice pasta at no additional charge.   I have the burger on a gluten free bun. I asked for curly fries on the side. It was good but nothing special.   They also have a special Top Chef Masters Canada inspired menu which included an Apple Bacon Blue Cheese tart. You'd love it if you liek Blue Cheese."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I dined here this past Saturday with a party of 20. The ambiance, wait service and attention were all superb. Yes these are all things that contribute to a great restaurant, but we must also take into consideration the speed of service, the food flavours and value for money.  I ordered the roasted beet salad and was more than disappointed. I received 4 slivers of small beets on the four corners of my plate. These slivers did not even amount to the size of one small beet. May I also add that beets are currently in season, with a large bag selling at less than $5 at the grocery store. I would have called this a spring mix and goat cheese salad, since there were more greens than anything else on my plate and the beets were merely used as a garnish.  We were given a 2 hour time slot, as they required the space for another party coming in after us. The food took 45 minutes to arrive, leaving us no time to order dessert or coffee after dinner."}
{"text":"I suppose places like Milestone's fill a unavoidable yet tacky niche in the dinning landscape: high end casual fine dining. And yet it works for the most part. It's reliable and comforting choice for groups of people, tourists and suburbanites and generally anyone looking to play it safe in a lively, stylish decorated area. There are plenty of girly and non girly drinks abound here to keep anyone interested in having a good time entertained and the loud music or the front patio is nice if you're in for some people watching in the entertainment district.   That being said, mains and drinks are priced almost close to what you could get at a local fine dining/bistro type place with more creativity and freshness taken into account for the dishes. Take the artichoke dip at Milestone's for example, tasty yes but at $10.99 it's a little hard to take especially when it seems that it mostly likely given a zap before arriving at the table. Or the pastas which of ginormous size and generally palatable but when basil and roma tomatoes are promised and one receives sun dried tomatoes and cilantro (wtf?) slight irritation ensues.  Anywhoo. Milestone's is not the antichrist when it comes to great food because it's somewhat consistent and you know that you can come here in a group and manage to please most everyone with the safe menu. But it ain't exactly awe-inspiring either-there are plenty of better, independent options around town."}
{"text":"What I'm going to say will be consistent with some reviews I've read. Service was quite slow, 10 minutes a time-slow. Our server was great and very friendly but she was not there much. We ordered our food and waited.. And waited.. And waited. Had the calamari app, burger and grilled salmon. Food was good, not complaining there.. Just the speed of the service was incredibly slow. Honestly, it was so slow I was quite disappointed, especially for a chain restaurant. We were hungry before coming.. And we keep seeing food being brought to other tables but our food took forever.. honestly.. 3 stars for now, until I come back and try again.. Sighh"}
{"text":"I had lunch there.  Nice contemporary interior design... very appealing.  A mix of booth style seating and tables.  Very relaxed atmosphere.  The kitchen is sort of open in the back so you can hear the busy kitchen sounds in the background that add to the whole ambiance.  I had the American style burger with ceasar salad.  Very good burger with thick patty.  You can check out there website for more info... http://www.milestonesrestaurants.com"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times.  Today, it took a while to get seated, the hostess was nowhere to be seen.  She came after 5 minutes.  We ordered my favourite ahi tuna tacos, they are absolutely delicious.  I get them every time I come.  They have a special anniversary menu, that comprises of a 3 course meal for only $25.  We got the mini sliders for starter, meatloaf for main and cheesecake for dessert.  We also got the new york strip and a seafood fettucine.  The sliders were juicy and delicious.  Meatloaf was nice but the sauce was a bit too tangy.  Steak was good and pasta was fine too.   Our server was really nice and we had to pack up the pasta to go.  I took one star away because we didn't get our dessert, we were too stuffed and didn't realise till we got home.  It's a nice place for food and drinks, I have enjoyed every visit."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with the Breakfast Wrap. Literally. Everyone who knows me usually knows that if I'm out of bed before 2pm on the weekend, it's because I went to Yorkdale to buy a breakfast wrap. It's the perfect combo of egg, salsa, cheese, and avocado salsa in a huge tortilla. It doesn't matter whether I stay there or get it to go, it always tastes good from this location.  I also love the Artichoke and Spinach Dip, the Chicken Pesto Fettucini, the mojitos and the bellinis, especially the extra shot of rum or vodka you can add.  I've always had great service here, especially at the bar for pick up. My order has always been ready in the time frame they give me and I usually get in and out faster than a virgin. That way, all my time and energy can be focused on my love...is it brunch time yet?"}
{"text":"My family and I visited milestones around 4pm today for a late lunch, early dinner. We were hungry, but we were just looking for a small meal to tide us over until dinnertime. To be quite honest, if I could, I would give this restaurant a zero rating. I have lived in the area for 23 years and visited this milestones on countless occasions, and I never seemed to have a problem with it before. Today however, was the first time we had been there since the big fancy renovations were completed. They must have spent a lot of money on the place because I will admit profusely that it was very well designed, and the environment was warm and inviting and pleasing to look at aesthetically. Unfortunately, that's where the good things came to an end.  For starters, the men's bathroom had a terrible odour to it (as conveyed to me by my Dad who went in before we placed our orders). When the waitress came to our table, my dad asked her if the General Manager was on site so that they could maybe pop into the bathroom and see what the issue was, but the waitress told him that the GM wasn't around and the she would pass on the message.  Next came our order. My dad ordered a shrimp and lobster bisque which looked quite delicious in the picture on the menu. When it arrived? The soup had an extreme amount of salt, and there was absolutely no shrimp in the dish. I tried to point out to the waitress that something was missing from the dish, but she brushed me off and ran away. My dad also told her about three times that there was way too much salt in his soup.  Next came my meal. I ordered the Cajun Shrimp Creole for myself. I was quite excited to try it as the description made it sound delectable. When it arrived, the first thing I reached for with my fork was the salad leaves that were on the plate. And to my dismay, the salad was...hot? The shrimp and rice part of the dish was supposed to be hot, that I understand. But the salad was hot too. And on top of that, every single salad leaf in my plate was touched and brown, leading me to the conclusion that this salad was definitely not fresh. When the waitress eventually came to collect our plates, she remarked \"oh you didn't eat your veggies\", to which I responded \"well, all of the leaves are touched, so no\". I said it politely, but what was her reaction? She said absolutely nothing. She raised her eyebrows at me in a rather sarcastic manner, once again brushing off my comment, took my plate, and left.  Sure, things happen at restaurants that are not under the waitresses control, but every single issue that we experienced during our meal today could very easily have been rectified by the waitress if she had had even a slightly pleasant attitude, or if she even tried to make us feel better about our choice to eat here today. If she had apologized, or looked into the reason why I got a rotten salad for my meal, I would have been grateful for her consideration and I would have left happy. But literally nothing was done. Milestones spent how much money on doing a nice big fancy renovation? Yet the one small thing that ended up having the biggest influence on the customer turned out to be the waitress and her unpleasant attitude. It looks like they still have some work to do after all! Very disappointed, and I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"My sister and her family took me here for lunch over the weekend.   The food was pretty good.  I had the Garden Burger (veggie) with the spring salad and both of them had very good flavour. I loved the avocado with the burger.    I think they may have been short a server or something because it took close to 35 minutes for our food to come out, even coffee took 10 minutes and getting a kids menu/crayons took 5 minutes as well.    Usually I would be quite upset at this, especially for a chain restaurant where you expect to be served in 15 minutes or less (or at most 20 minutes), however the manager was very apologetic and ended up giving us more than 50% off the bill plus an additional $15 off (my sister had a coupon, but he said he would just take it off and gave her back the coupon).    However, things happen, maybe it was a new server, maybe they were short, but if you apologize and correct your mistakes, then I'm okay with it."}
{"text":"Milestone's, oh Milestone's. The only time I go to this establishment is when I have one of those gift certificates to burn. (Always provided by an elderly aunt who believes it's the pinnacle of suburban class).  The gigantic restaurant was half empty and we were seated in a cramped two person spot, ok, whatever, I understand you're banking on big groups but it was already 10 p.m. and guess what, THEY'RE NOT COMING.  Regardless, my Guiness martini was delicious and bizarre and the boyfriend got a decent bellini. We were unimpressed by the meal offerings for the price (and past experience) so we got the goat cheese bruschetta which was pretty tasty and the phyllo shrimp.   Why is this only a two review instead of a three? The washrooms were gross. I went twice, once at the beginning around 10pm and again at about 11pm. Overflowing wastebaskets, toilet paper everywhere,  drippy sinks, the first stall was broken. Etc. Not what I expected for the price of the products."}
{"text":"Loved it.   been twice recently, I always enjoyed going to Milestones at other locations.   Came here on a Sunday post Stampeding hard on a Saturday night. (We originally went to Coras which had about 40 ppl in line).   We wanted brunch. and we got brunch. Their California eggs Benedict far surpasses the eggs Benedict at Coras - or anyone else. Moderately priced too!   Went recently to try out there \"Girls night out\" menu. Awesome. $40 for 4 Belinis and 4 appys. It worked out well. really enjoyed the Shrimp, the artichoke dip was good too.   I'll go back again to try something for dinner.. or well at least for brunch!"}
{"text":"I always forget about this place, but I was meeting a friend downtown for lunch and it was in the middle of our locations.   We went at 1 which was perfect as we beat the lunch rush. And they now have a gluten free section on their menu as well, which is fab. Very nice decor and you have the option of lounge and restaurant to eat at.   Service was a little slow, especially for not being busy, but we weren't too rushed. I went the salad with goat cheese, strawberries, spinach and chicken. It was delish!"}
{"text":"Great for celebrating an occasion!!!  I made reservations for a surprise birthday party for 25 people at lunch and it turned out wonderful.  The whole process was easy.  The cutomer service managers were great to deal with.  Communication was quick and easy.  Everything was done up and confirmed in 3 days.  They offered a great group lunch menu with appetizer, entree and tea/coffee.  And the price was excellent! (this counts when only one person is footing the bill) Of course price is secondary to the whole experience.   They seated us in a semi private area away from other walk-in patrons. The waitresses were friendly and organized. They got our orders right and the food was very good. The waitress even told me she entered the kids orders first, so that it would come out first.  Wow, talk about being attentive to your customers!  They also suggested that we order the tea/coffee for when they bring the birthday cake out; which was a great idea.  Everyone had a great time and many of the guests commented how it was a  great choice in venue.  I am so pleased with Milestones ~ Thank you."}
{"text":"Slow service, forgot to include chicken on the salad, rustic club sandwich had no taste, food took forever."}
{"text":"This was a fav until they changed the menu.  I can't say I crave a certain dish from there anymore.  Why fix something that's not broken?"}
{"text":"I go to Milestones approximately once every three weeks, and I have not been disappointed so far. I usually get a burger with sweet potato fries and I usually go by myself during my lunch or before work, and the staff never make me feel awkward for being by myself.  The burger is always good, although the bun tends to get quite soggy from all the oils and falls apart sometimes. The sweet potato fries and the aioli that comes with them is to die for! I had a great time, and you guys will see me again in about three weeks!"}
{"text":"Definitely surprised that this Milestones was better than the others I have visited. I guess you can teach, add to pot and heat, but getting it right isn't that simple. This location probably has the better cooks compared to other locations."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience tonight because of an inexperienced server. Started off okay, she seemed friendly and she told us she was new. Service was really slow consistently (from her getting our orders to getting us our drinks), but we knew she was new so we were trying to be patient. What pushed us to leave was waiting for an hour without an entree.   I think they started to notice about 40 minutes in that they forgot to put in our order maybe because of the dissapointed/frustrated looks on our faces and also because of our glaringly empty table. The server came by at this time to say that the food was coming out in 5 minutes. 10 minutes later the food was still not there so we put some cash on the table for our drinks and left. We were stopped by the manager saying the food was just about to come out, but we really didn't have the patience to wait any longer. My boyfriend voiced his frustration, the manager listened and apologized and appeared reasonable. The server that was supervising our server came out to apologize and also tried to convince us to stay, he also offered to have us take our food to go so that's what we did. (We actually sat down and had to wait another 5/10 minutes for our food to actually be ready).   I have no problem with the food, it was great. I also thought the manager and the more experience server actually dealt with the situation reasonably too. But they shouldn't have let this happen in the first place. It's ridiculous to have customers wait an hour for their meal! We came in at around 7 and left around 8:30 with not much in our stomachs but a free meal to go. Don't know if I'd come back to this location because from reading others' reviews, they seem to have a consistent problem with their servers."}
{"text":"We came here tonight to celebrate my birthday.  I usually go to the location near Scarborough Town Centre, but decided to try here because it's so close to my house.  Sadly, we should've driven to the other location.   First of all, it was a nightmare to find a parking spot, everywhere was full, we ended up on the east side, half done lot.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were told there was a 25 minute wait, no problem, we took a walk into the cinema.  I love the Ahi tuna tacos but they don't have them at this location.  In fact, they have a new menu that isn't on their website. I was looking forward to them, so much.  We ended up getting the Social Platter, to share.  It comprised of hot wings, asian chicken bites, spinach and artichoke dip and some bread.  Could have done with one of the chicken components not being spicy.  Mains were classic burger, Lamb Sirloin, Chicken and Mushroom Vermicelli and kids sliders with fries.  The food in general was of a good serving size and was nice tasting.  Fries weren't very good, they were dark and soggy.  Another thing I didn't like was the plates.  I much prefer white plates and bowls rather than the type they have here.  Food does not look appetising served on or in them. (see pics) They just don't look clean.  The hostesses were cold and not very welcoming in their short bodycon dresses and the wait staff looked like they worked in a garden centre or just got off an art class.    Overall it's a nice place with decent food and great service but I much prefer the old menu and not this new menu.  So I don't think I'll be back at this location."}
{"text":"It's truly a hit and miss type of menu. I count being with the right people and being in the right part of town for the primary reason I'm here. To me, this is my back up when Joey's, and Mercatto are booked solid (I wonder why they're booked solid and Milestone's has tables?)."}
{"text":"Ambiance and service is terrific. The food however is a different story. The parking is another tragedy of this location.   I can't believe how atrocious the parking facilities are. Having getting over this by our 5+ minute stroll in the deep freeze, I was able to warm up in the restaurant.   I had a particularly difficult time in selecting my meal. What I settled on was greeted with cheese on the noodles. Personally, I like certain cheeses, but I truly dislike grated cheese on my pasta. Why do restaurants automatically add cheese to their food? Unfortunately it came that way, but the server was kind enough to replace my destroyed entre√®. Like it said, service was great!  The food overall is a just very average, while you're paying for the use of their nicely appointed facilities."}
{"text":"I decided to try something new during my last visit and I was quite happy with my selection. I usually have the burger or the red thai however I tried the seaside salad this time. Very tasty, great portion and the grilled salmon and shrimps made up the protein.   My guests enjoyed their meal as well.   Service was attentive without disrupting our meeting.   Nicely done Milestones."}
{"text":"So... I came by today after work to enjoy some of their Stiegal Radler on tap - but much to my dismay they no longer have it. Now I know what you're all thinking... Why the hell would you drink a beer that's only like 2%. The answer is that it's a great beverage on a summer day when you don't want to get buzzed but still want a little something something to sip on (hmmm that sounds strange.... Uhmmmm never mind).  So I raise my glass of Shock Top instead to morn the passing of my fav Milestones beverage on a summer work night.   RIP Stiegal Radler.... RIP."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this review. As it was my first time going here to try it out I sort of had high expectations, especially on mother's day. We booked our seat a week in advance for 1pm brunch on Mother's day this past Sunday. I arrived ten minutes early and the front door was rammed. I finally got to the front where the lady greeted me and apologized that our seat wasn't ready yet...which was fine with me since my party was still trying to find parking. We waited a good 30 minutes past our seating reservation and finally got seated in the back where we got a nice sized booth. It was a great seat and very private. So the wait did not bother me at all. Our waiter was very nice and pleasant plus very attentive. He took down our order and drinks. All of our drinks came quick. But after that, we waited and waited for our food to arrive. 30 minutes later, still no food at our table. We kindly asked our waiter who also aplogized for the wait on our food but said the kitchen is a bit backed up today. 1 hour mark passed and no food still. WTH?  We were beginning to wonder whats going on with the kitchen. Not a good sign for my first experience here. Seriously, there should be absolutely no excuse for food to take 1hour after ordering to arrive. Our reso was at 1pm, we waited 30 minutes to get seated (now its 1:30pm) ... then 1 hour for food and still no food at our table (its now 2:30pm) ... we are all starving. Geez. It did finally arrive to our table around 2:45pm but not with other mishaps. My mom's steak brunch platter barely had any meat. It was covered in chopped potatoes like they ran out of meat or something. My mom's not even a big eater but she noticed this because there really was barely any meat on her order when there should be. By this time we were not impressed and very disappointed. Its Mothers day and we had a bad experience. Thank gwosh our waiter was great and very understanding. And we understand it is not his fault for all this ... its the kitchen who does not have proper guidance or perhaps a breakdown in communication somewhere there. Maybe this place is too new and can't keep up with the demand. Who knows. I don't know if i'll be coming back since Joey's is down the street. I guess we'll see."}
{"text":"All milestones are top notch as far as franchises go, so 3 stars is as good as it gets.  This one has a new decor that supposedly all are transitioning to.  But the most notable is the enhanced bar and beer selection where they are adding Canadian craft beers."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of the chain dining experience because I have never had a really good one. And the trend continues....  Two days prior to eating here, I had the opportunity to dine at Charcut and experience Chef Connie DeSousa's pork croquettes, which I might add were superb. We were delighted to see her croquettes on the Milestones seasonal menu as part of a cross promotion with Top Chef Canada so we jumped all over the chance to eat them again. What I would like to know is what Milestones did to turn something so delicious in its original form at Charcut into dreck at their restaurant?  I wasn't familiar with any of their main dishes so I ordered the  portobello mushroom chicken which the menu stated was a \"favourite with guests and staff alike\". I guess that I am not drinking the Milestones koolaid because I thought it was one of the worst restaurant dishes I have had in quite some time. Salty dry chicken on a clump of capellini sitting in a pool of watery sauce is not worthy of a ringing endorsement. The best that the rest of my dining party could say about their own main courses was that they were \"okay\".  The service was adequate although 4 out of 5 members of our party received their entrees while the fifth sat idly by for more than 5 minutes until we caught the waitress' attention to get her to retrieve the errant food.   This meal is a  primer on bastardizing good ingredients by a corporation. The price-point that Milestones charge should make this restaurant fall into the category of fine-dining but there wasn't much fine about it. For the money I would rather go to a \"one of\" restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my best friends got married the night before at the nearby Terrace banquet center so we came for brunch the next day. I got a french toast and it was not bad. Couldve done with slightly less syrup but definitely very fresh. I wish I wouldve gotten the prime rib hash eggs benny though. Cuz my friend got it and it looked amazing. If I ever return itll be for that prime hash benny.  We sat on the patio cuz it was a beautiful day outside. The soundtrack was top 40 hits. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Refilled my water every 5 min. Chatted with us for a bit since the place wasnt particularly packed for brunch.   P.S. Try their bellinis during happy hr or in the evening. They are lowkey tasty af lol. Just the right amount of sweetness."}
{"text":"We came for a light lunch and ordered from the seasonal menu.  We had the roasted pepper and tomato bisque - just a bit heavy on the salt, but that's just me. We also tried the pork croquettes, should have read the reviews first! It can't be pork! The onion ring is the worst I've ever had! The batter is way too thick. To think this was a top chef winning dish!!!  The salad was good, but then again it was one of the original items, milestones California spring salad.  The bellini was great, not too sweet. Then again I had the raspberry, the malibu might have been sweeter. The dessert of strawberry shortcake, well, it's more of an upside down muffin with way too salty cured lemon rinds, whipped cream, no hint of vanilla as suggested and strawberry topping.  In short stay with the original menu and I'm only coming back for brunch!! The extra 2 stars is for our server and the excellent service we received!!"}
{"text":"As a previous reviewer said, it's sorta hit or miss...however, I've found whenever it's a \"miss\", they make up for it with a free entree or appetizer, or whatever wasn't quite right, along with an apology direct from the manager, so for that, I'm okay with them.   But overall, it's convenient, good price, variety on the menu, etc. and far better than many of the other Milestones."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this milestones many times as it is right in the core and within walking distance from my office.  Milestones is very consistent and to me that is a very good thing in a restaurant. The staff are always very friendly, and because I am a regular, they remember me by name when I come in. Food portions are always plentiful, quality of food is very high and the menu ranges from standard pub like fare as well as some more high end items, steaks seafood etc.  Customer service here is always exceptional, it is clear that the management run the restaurant with uncompromising standards.  Word of advice, make a reservation if you are planning to come in for lunch as they are almost always full over the lunch hour.  The decor is comfortable, and inviting. Wood accents, padded booths and chic stylish touches make this a good place to meet friends for dinner.  Milestones is a great option for lunch or dinner as prices are always very reasonable, food is good and customer service is exceptional."}
{"text":"I need to give Milestones a shout out for serving decent steak and cocktails.  Saturday found me hitting up Milestone's for their rather awesome patio. After being told there was  30-40 minute wait we settled at the bar and ordered a couple of drinks.  Might I recommend the cucumber and basil martini...sweet and summery!   We actually waited 10 minutes and were given a spot on the patio. There are days when nothing but steak will satisfy; those days where you need to get your red meat on. I ordered my steak with a side of mushrooms. The steak was cooked to my liking and comes with seasonal veggies and garlic mashed potatoes. Can't really ask for more than that...perfect.  Waiting staff were attentive, friendly and on hand to recommend drinks (for the more indecisive cocktail jumping drinkers like myself).  Prices are reasonable; washrooms clean; does everything the place is meant to.  Solid 4 stars from this Yelper"}
{"text":"This location is what I'm a fan of. I usually have had bad experiences at Milestones which has led me not to dine with them for over a year. Last night my husband and I decided to dine in. So glad we did! We were seated promptly and the server was very friendly! Always smiling. I did feel she was a little short staff or something because it was hard to get her attention sometimes. This is one of the two reasons they lost a star.  The food: I ordered the chili chicken rice bowl and it was so good! My only complaint- I needed more crispy wontons! The crispy wontons with the chicken in that sweetly spiced sauce was heavenly! The rice was really good and the veggies were good as well. I ended up eating everything which is always a good sign! My husband ordered the seafood pasta and he finished his plate to. He did mention it was pretty good. We decided to end the night with the white chocolate cheesecake which was yummy. Rich and creamy!  All in all, I would return again and order the same thing! Maybe this time around they will have the prime rib sliders to order! Apparently they had run out of the small buns, which is the second reason for the lost star."}
{"text":"Decor and ambiance is definitely the high-point of this spot. Food was very underwhelming. Wine list Meh. Given I was in the 'burbs of Toronto, I guess I shouldn't have expected much better?"}
{"text":"Somehow I seem to end up here after eating at Sabai Sabai for dessert. It's happened twice now, and we easily find ourselves seated in the bar area, on high top tables, looking over dundas square. One of the few places in the core with a nice view.   For dessert, I love the 5 different shots of desserts. Variety and good to share, but only between couples. We tried to between 4 people once, and it was sort of a disaster.   I love the trendy decor, for a chain restaurant, and the private dining area of which I've had a few birthdays and large parties in. But find it quite dim and hard to see in the evening. I also don't like the funky smells in the bar area, not sure was it was last night.   Food wise, it's good, hasn't changed much from years past, but nothing amazing, but it's not dull either.  But if I could choose, for a full meal, I'd probably opt for Joeys a few steps down the street."}
{"text":"I was left alone by my friend as he watched his basketball game and this is the first place that caught my eye.    I was already in love with Toronto and the countless numbers of gorgeous men grew with my busboy and bartender here.  I was so hungry I couldn't decide what to order so the bartender suggested the soup and sandwich.  Good pick.  The soup was amazing. So good that I don't remember what sandwich I had to accompany it."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon last week.   Ordered the surf and turf for about $28.  Steak was pretty good, but was very disappointed in the \"turf\" portion of the meal.  It was just a few shavings of lobster (and honestly, that's what the menu said, but I saw the title and didn't read the rest). I kind of expected a lobster tail instead.  Honestly, the food isn't bad and the service is okay, but I always find this chain restaurants kind of expensive and not the best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Amazing service and staff make this Milestone a great venue for group events such as Holiday parties and birthdays. Located in the same complex as the AMC theatre located at the intersection of Yonge and Dundas Streets, Milestones offers guests topnotch service and amazing views of the Eaton Centre, Dundas Square, and downtown Toronto's financial district.  Opal and her wait staff were outstanding in providing the large group of employees who showed up for our office holiday party with dedicated service. The lunch menu offers something for everyone from Steak to Chicken Masala and with a creative, attentive bar staff, the myriad of speciality drinks from frozen Bellini's to flavored martinis kept the crowd happy.  Highly recommended for those looking to host a group event or looking to have lunch/dinner in an attractive, cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here tonight because we had a gift card. The bartender was great. Prompt service, cold drinks, very friendly & chatty. If I went back it'd be to chat her up. No seats were available at the bar though.  Service at our booth was poor. Fries cold, undercooked. How do you screw up fries?! My salad, which I had before, wasn't good this time. I actually ended up having an allergic reaction from these \"sweety drop peppers.\" I had this salad back in the spring and remembered it being good. Not this time. Disappointing experience. We agreed we'd rather spend the extra money and go to the keg."}
{"text":"The company decided to do Christmas lunch in milestones second year in a row. I was not impressed by their food last year, so kind of knew what to expect. Well, this year they have went above and beyond my expectations ( I am being facetious). Not sure how to spoil a fire-grilled salmon and boiled rice, but they've managed to do that. The only good thing was the size, it was really small, not enough to get sick right away (wait till the evening when you regret every bite). Rice was probably cooked a few days before as well as salmon and then heated up straight on or with the plate which was smothered with \"grilled veggies\" (don't try this at home). Grilled veggies consisted of grilled zuccini prepared a few days back that were already falling apart from moisture (not a good thing for a grilled food). Rice was dry and plasticky from being left out of water for a long time. Salmon had the same issue being left out uncovered and then re-heated. And to top it up I have found a hair on my plate and that was the end of my lunch. Since it was company's Christmas lunch I have kept my mouth shut. But as it was not sponsored and I paid $24.5 for the main dish alone I've decided to leave a review. And, to my point, even 1 star is very generous for this particular place (calling it a restaurant would be too much of an honour which they don't live up to). Unfortunately at the time I did not argue and did paid my bill which I regret full-heartidly now. By the way their bill says CASH ONLY, a way to discourage people using credit cards.  I sincerely hope that at some point they will get a customer who is not as placid and agreeable like myself and who will give them what they deserve. Their cooks don't deserve to even touch pans, leave alone cooking. Disgrace to a restaurant business. Absolutely horrific place. Not sure why people choose it over other eateries on the same street, but it definitely not worth a try. There is no third time for me. If you value your health and know at least a little about decent food, avoid milestones on king west!!!"}
{"text":"WORST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD. Never in my life have I had such a bad experience in a restaurant. Milestones completely lost control of their restaurant last night. It was actually sad to watch. We were taking out our family who just arrived from Ireland earlier that day, to somewhere I thought would be 'impressive', god were we wrong.   First of all we ordered drinks- It took 25 MINUTES for our waiter to bring them out. We stopped another waiter in the mean time and asked him why it was taking so long, his response was 'we are short staffed and super busy' and that there 'is only 1 barman', 1 BARMAN in the whole in bar. We then proceeded to order our food (I thought in my head that the food can make up for the drinks taking ages). The food came out after a long 50 minutes. It was all STONE COLD. All the steaks were rare, after we asked for three medium and one well done. They mixed up our order bringing out three mash potato, instead one meant to be with fries . ..  The fries that they did bring out were BURNED TO A CRISP and looked like they had been cooked over and over... AND there were forks and knives missing from the table.  At that point for the first time in my life I said we were sending this crap back. I wouldn't have fed it to a dog. It was completely inedible. We called over the manager and told her exactly how we felt, we told her to taste the steak. She completely admitted defeat, saying repeatedly' I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, your totally right. its a disgrace.' In my eyes I think that the manager should have stopped people coming in the front door, obviously knowing she had completely lost control of the restaurant. She then tried to win us back, offering us drinks, another meal and vouchers. We said no, honestly all we wanted to do was get out of there. I told her that I  would never come back again even if you paid me. So we walked out still starving.  I let her know I would write this review on Yelp too. What a let down and embarrassment for the first night our family were in Canada. Angry and disappointed."}
{"text":"I am aware of the low star rating they have. I am rating the place on my own experience. From the moment I entered I was greeted warmly and shown to my table. Our server was very nice (Claudia). She recommended all the dishes from starter to the main and dessert. And good recommendations they were. I usually don't like sweet shrimps but these mango chilli shrimps had a nice meaty bite to them and we're on top of a nice shredded veges. Tip : please add actually Julians of mango underneath the shrimps. Portobello chicken with pasta was very good. Though the chicken was a tad bit over done. the chocolate brownie underneath the ice cream was cold, would have been perfect if the brownie was hot. My friend a d i shared a main and our server was nice enough to make sure the kitchen split of nicely for us. They made it seem like we ordered two seprate mains. So plus points. I suggest you this place at least once. My suggestion is to listen to the server. Ask them what's fresh and what you like. They will recommend accordingly."}
{"text":"Decently priced bellinies' and Pints of Stella Artois', And great food. Who could complain about that, right?I got the Bellini, as I usually do(get feminine drinks...lol) my wife got the pint of beer. For dinner I got the surf and turf sirloin, which is the replacement for the shrimp and crab steak which is a welcome change, the sauces from the steak blend nicely with the crab butter, and the sauces that remain once you finish the steak make a great substitute to the ketchup.The once bland green beens are now accompanied by what tasted like caramelized onions, yummy! My wife got the sweet chilli chicken, which I tried, and can say it is sweet but with a kick.  is delightfully slushy, an adult slushy if you will. Not to mention the staff our waitress was super attentive"}
{"text":"Service was barely there.   Table wasn't wiped down before the hostess checked properly and placed down the menus.   Took forever to get a drink. Had to ask for side plates when the food arrived. Took forever for the bill as well.   It wasn't that busy of a night, but somehow, our server was missing for most of the part.   Calamari was not bad. The goat cheese plate was mediocre. Cesar salad was average.   The featured Vanilla bourbon blueberry fancy cocktail sucked. Moscow Mule was way better."}
{"text":"The food was actually really good. Had the Beef bolognese with mushrooms and spinach. It was full of flavor. I would tell you how I enjoyed their signature Bellini drink, but they forgot to bring it, and by that time, dinner was served, so I didn't bother complaining. My wife ordered the prime rib, but they were out!!!?!?! So she had the chicken which she enjoyed as well  Customer service could have been better, but food was great t."}
{"text":"I've visited about a half dozen times when visiting T.O.  It's a chain, but it's reliable.  I've enjoyed every meal here, and received consistently good service at this location.  I'd recommend most any time.  It's downtown Toronto, parking's a \"pita.\""}
{"text":"Recently have been very disappointed with this location! We found that the place seems so dead, and due to that maybe; the staff looks bored And miserable. The management is a joke! The guy who is always there, I've heard him on his cell Phone multiple Times near the bar, taking personal Calls, not friendly Nor professional. The big shocker for me was when We recently visited another location, and I tried ordering a dish I usually Have at this location, and was shocked to learn that it was not safe for me to have with my food sensitivities! Not only that! Even the food that comes out of the deep frier that's not safe as well! I've been sick to my stomach On 2 separate occasions in the past few visits! I literally thought it could have been the desert! And the precious time the cocktail! They should Really Train their staff on the ingredients, and have access to the book like they did at the other location Where they Were trained! And brought the book out to show me! I would not go here again, this place is not happening, no one goes here, the staff is miserable, and now the food is not safe to eat."}
{"text":"With Christmas just around the corner, my boyfriend and I have been saving our pennies, so going out to enjoy a meal has become a special occasion.  We chose Milestones for the atmosphere, the good food and drinks (as we've experienced first-hand in the past), and the mid-level price range (on par with other restaurants).  Things started off so promising.  We were told it would be about a 45-minute wait.  They took my cell phone number and promised to call as soon as a table became ready.  I loved that.  Who wants to be tethered within 30-foot radius of the hostess booth holding one of those obnoxious vibrating buzzers?  We explored the area a bit, and within 10 minutes, we were called that our table was ready.  Excellent.  Once seated we started pouring over the menus.  With a ton of options, it's always a (welcome) chore to decide what to eat.  We decided within a few minutes, and then waited for our waitress to arrive.  And waited.  And waited.  After about 10 minutes, someone finally appeared, genuinely friendly, but a little slow for my tastes.  To save time, we ordered our drinks, an appetizer, and our entrees all at once.  BIG mistake.  Our drinks arrived in about 10 minutes.  By the time our entrees arrived, I had finished my ultimate bellini.  If you've had one of these bellini's in the past, you know that finishing this 3 oz. frozen monstrosity is no small feat, so we were obviously waiting awhile.  And where was that appetizer we ordered?  Well, we never got a good answer about that.  Apparently, our waitress \"punched it in\" but it never arrived.  And who wants to eat an appetizer after their entree?  For fear of sending our food back and having it arrive to us cold in 20 minutes, we asked them to just forget about the appetizer and just give us our food.  I ordered another drink as the plates hit the table.  I ordered the sausage ravioli, which was good, if not overdone.  The edges of the ravioli's were crispy, and some of them were even singed.  At least it was warm, which is more than I can say about my boyfriend's burger and fries.  Everything was room temperature, as though it had been finished well before my ravioli and had been sitting under food lamps, waiting for my dish to finish.  We would have asked to send it back to be heated, had someone bothered to stop by and see how we were doing and if we needed anything else with our meals (we did).  We finished our mediocre but expensive food in the appropriate amount of time, stacked the plates, had them whisked away, and then waited another 10 minutes for my drink to arrive.  That's right, we ate, had our table cleared, and then waited another 10 minutes for a drink to arrive from the bar.  The real kicker came when we went to pay.  You know how, when you pay by credit card with one of those machines they bring to the table, they have an automatic \"tip suggestion\" button that you can hit?  Milestones sets their \"suggestion\" to 25%!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  The whole experience left us feeling entirely cheated out of our Saturday night, and our money.  Thankfully, they comped the final drink, but it felt like a last-minute ditch to save the evening.  It just felt like they didn't care about our business at all.  From not checking to make sure we got the food we ordered, to the slow service, to the inattentiveness, a free drink didn't go to far in ensuring we would visit again.  C'mon, Milestones.  It's not like this is your first Saturday night in business.  It's not like you're a small restaurant who isn't used to dealing with crowds.  You're located in the heart of a bustling city, and people rely on you for date night.  The fact we had to pay for our food after an absolutely lack-luster experience felt like we were robbed.  Potential diners: if you value your time and money, stay away.  There are dozens of other restaurants in the area that will take care of you a lot better than this run-of-the-mill franchise."}
{"text":"Tried the new dish a DIY taco, called Peruvian buritos ? Meat was very salty and along with the fresh shredded cheese even saltier. Just the right amount of tacos if you broke them into 4 bite size pieces. Lettuce shredded and turning black at the edges."}
{"text":"Tried the fish and chips, both extremely oily/greasy. Oil wasn't hot enough?  Ordered 1 piece of fish but got 2 . Unfortunately could barely stomach the 1 st piece  No veg, no fruit, just chips and fish, ketchup and seafood sauce"}
{"text":"Went for pre theatre apps, 80 % of the restaurant was \"reserved\" ie no one there. Explained we would be in and out in 45 min, still argued about a table,   Once seated service was good, food (apps ) fast and tasty, Caesar salad was a little tired so they volunteered to make a new one.   If the front line was not so stubborn would have been a 4 star experience"}
{"text":"Didn't really enjoy my experience here. I went out with my boyfriend for his birthday,  and was expecting to have a more enjoyable time. It wasn't horrible,  but it wasn't great. We were seated close to the front door an were freezing the entire night. The server didn't do anything special for us,  and was quite MIA.  They cooked my boyfriends steak faaar too rare ( he asked for medium rare). Overall,  just a pretty bad dinner...  Thank goodness I had a giftcard, otherwise would not have been worth my money."}
{"text":"The waitress we had was lovely but the food for all of us was either too salty or greasy or too much truffle. Not very appetizing. The chorizo fries were amazing tho but nothing else was. Won't go back"}
{"text":"I came here after checking out the pride festivities with 3 friends. We originally wanted to go to a different place but the wait was too long so we came here instead. I would've preferred to sit in the patio but there was a $25 minimum per person to sit outside so we passed (this was due to customers who want to view the parade and will end up staying for hours).   The service could've been better but the restaurant was pretty busy so it's understandable. Our server tried his best, he checked up on us regularly, informed us when our items were delayed, etc.   The food was tasted okay, but thats exactly how I expected it to be. The drinks were good and I liked that my sangria had a small skewer in it for if I want to eat the fruits.   I probably will come back but only on Mondays during ladies night (4 apps and 4 bellinis for $40)."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy Friday night because we couldn't get a spot at La Carnitas. I was pleasantly surprised! The food they served for their Cinco de mayo event wasn't bad at all. The flavours were quite good and fresh. They had an injury in the kitchen that day so we ended up waiting 45 min for our food"}
{"text":"Well deserving of 5 stars for atmosphere, food quality and variety, service, and full bar.  This restaurant looks brand new, but I could not confirm.  In any event, it is lovely inside and out, and would be fine for a romantic date of for a family.  I took my wife and toddler son there, and our food was excellent, not very good, excellent.  We had fish tacos, miso cod, and portobello mushroom chicken vermicelli, and all were excellent.  Loved the choices of draft beer, and that our server could describe them to me.  Gentleman: take your wife or girlfriend here, or both, they will like the sophisticated atmosphere and great food.  Was not crazy about or dessert, and maybe you will.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service in this establishment is absolutely horrible. I came here with a work group for lunch and we waited 30 minutes to even get a glass of water. I deeply regret coming to this place for lunch. Being located in the entertainment district this place should realize that people have time limits for lunch. Especially if I made the reservation the day before. This is the last time I go to another milestones because I could have finished eating a whole meal twice in the time it took for us to get our food. Do not come to this location unless you have at least 2 hours+ allocated for lunch."}
{"text":"i came with a group of 25 for my birthday. honestly gotta love their customer service.  first and foremost making a reservation was easy.  so many other restaurants during december have such strict policies that you wonder if they even care about about the customer at all.  with milestones it was easy.  no prepay no prefix menus if you dont want it, seperate bills etc.  no resposibility to pay for no shows, other restaurants were extrenely demanding with stipulations that they lost me because it felt like it was all about money.  the set table was nice, the servers were funny and kind and the food on dec 10th was incredible.  incredible is an understatement.  my dad is a masterchef so growing up i knew the quality of food.  and well milestones hit the head on the nail. all guests that came said the food was excellent.  all in all i couldnt have b√®en happier.  ive been going to milestones my whole life and generally ive always b√®en satisfied with the experience. this time... it was over the top and the food was a big contributer.  thanks milestones"}
{"text":"I've been to Milestones many times but in Toronto.  I've been to this location just a handful of times.   The menu is different from the Toronto locations.  I don't particularly like the fact that the menu is different in each location.  Even the menu format is different ranging from book style to a back to back one pager.  Anyway, had the steak frites, which I hoped would be satisfactory since it should be a thin piece of meat.  What a mistake.  I do not order steak in a non steak house ever, because I've had such bad experience, but against all good judgment, I ordered it because I just wanted steak.  Chicken, seafood, salad won't do.  It was craving for that night.  So the steak was, of course, super chewy to the point that you can't swallow the steak.  The fries were great though! I love the parmesan which was evenly distributed on the thin fries which was garnished by parsley maybe?  The fries came with ketchup and mayo.    I also had the opportunity to try the beef bolognese made with meat sauce, pieces of beef chuck and sirloin.  This was really good as my companion was able to finish the entire thing even though she is a light eater.  For dessert, we had the caramel cheesecake.  It was really delicious, drizzled with caramel and chocolate.  It was a good portion size.  Our server was friendly and went beyond in order to please.  Despite this, the entire restaurant experience, including the food just warrants an average rating."}
{"text":"Hungry tourists + busy restaurant + bad waiter = bad, bad service, but good food cuz you're so hungry you'll eat just about anything. Well, that's not entirely true because the food was actually very good, but when your waiter literally ignores you most of the night--you're jaded.   Ok, I'll pull myself out of hungry, cranky tourist mode...I'm going to try to focus on the food....  We started with the world inspired dips, which were overall tasty. The ciabatta toasts were a little on the spicy side.   The Chicken Caesar was full of flavor, but low on chicken. Just a couple more strips and it would have been perfect.   The Butternut Squash ravioli was some of the best I've ever tasted. I loved the presentation with the tangy goat cheese and pecans.   A great, but pricey drink selection was available. My mojitio was a little strong and not the best tasting rum. The desserts sounded outstanding, but we'd waited with empty plates, waiting to be bused, on our table for about 15-20 minutes too long to want to stick around."}
{"text":"It was a quick decision to go to Milestones with a friend and I am glad we chose this location. We did not have to wait for a table and nabbed a booth by the bar. The bar area was very well maintained and the servers were attentive. Our food came quickly and tasted great. We went for the staple spinach and artichoke dip to start- not too oily, but it also could have been heated more.  Our mains came a bit too soon but tasted great. I had the spicy Thai noodle bowl and my friend had the red curry bowl. As a note, the Thai bowl is not actually spicy and the noodles may have been a bit over cooked, but we were very still pleased with the overall quality of service and the great flavour in the food."}
{"text":"Nice location in a pedestrian mall with a lot of outdoor seating.  Location, location, location, as it's said in real estate. These were the \"three best things \" about my visit, and the staff seem satisfied with that kind of status quo.  I got no silverware/napkin when I was seated, and these didn't arrive with my beverage order either, so I asked my server for them. She said \"sure\" and then proceeded to take other orders. My food arrived and I (silly me) assumed my server would make good on the silverware. Nope. Servers disappeared as I looked for someone.  Probably five minutes passed as my food sat getting cold. The sandwich I received was a minimalist interpretation of what was promised in the item's description. The Cesar cocktail was so painfully salty I couldn't finish it. The weather was nice!"}
{"text":"Not much to say that other people haven't but food was decent and place was clean which is all you ask for walking distance from my hotel. The staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm really confused on how slow and dissatisfied I am with the service at this milestones. I've come here before, and it was decent with speed and quality of food. Today I came with a party, for a wedding. After being seated, we waited 15mins to get water. Then after ordering drinks and appetizer and even our main course at 7:45ish, we didn't get our drinks and appetizers till 8:50pm. An hour later! The main course, which was picked from a small menu of 5 items, came at 9:15, nearly 30mins later. To top it off, 4 people didn't get there meal, and had to wait another 15mins for them to eat  Not happy at all. Milestones is normally very good. You would think it was busy at the restaurant, but it wasn't this Thursday night after the main rush of dinner.  I would not recommend this location, especially for parties. We've received no discount, ops 1 person got a free beer."}
{"text":"The food itself was tasty, but the service was not. I don't know if our waiter forgot to put our order in or what exactly happened but 3 other tables who sat down after us received their meals and almost finished them before we received ours. We had only ordered a salad and veggie burger which I don't think could take that long to make. When I asked the waiter how much longer the wait would be, he said he would check and get back to me but never did, and someone else ended up bringing us our food. Our waiter didn't apologize or give a reason for the delay."}
{"text":"I can't believe that this establishment hasn't been Yelp'ed by me yet !   My friend loves Milestone's so when we meet up for dinner, we always eat here. There are definitely better restos out there, but at least it's not like we're meeting at Taco Bell.  In Yorkdale, it's an easy spot to get to. The subway and the 401 are right there. Tons of parking spots in the car park of Yorkdale is a definite plus.  Service is pretty good. Food is quick. Decor of the place is nice.  I really, really, really like the California Salad. For under ten dollars, you get a very satisfying meal.  Milestone's is one of my favorites when it comes to chains. This particular location deserves a four star rating."}
{"text":"This is the worst Milestones location we've been to. The service is terrible, and even the food is not on par with other Milestones.  We've been multiple times when they've ran out of prime rib at 7pm. Another person ordered pasta special (don't remember which type) and they ran out. It was two of our birthdays and we used the birthday coupon (sign up for their newsletter, they actually don't spam you that much) - the waiter didn't say anything, didn't ask whose it was, didn't do anything for us, except take and apply the coupon.   Would not recommend and have not been back since."}
{"text":"Regretfully, I came here with a group of 20 for my cousin's bday lunch.  The service was painstakingly slow: We sat down at 12:30pm, waited til 1:50pm to receive food, food was cold, we got the bills at 3:00pm, and payments were processed at 3:15pm.   Another pressing issue was the collection and redemption of Scene points. They advertise that you can collect 1 Scene point for every $3 spent at Milestones. Additionally, you can redeem 1000 Scene points for $10 off your bill. When it came to collecting Scene points, the waitress claimed that only 1 person could collect at our table of 20, even though we each paid individually. Secondly, when it came to redeeming Scene points, they were unable to do so. It was not until we spoke to the manager that they said we could still redeem the points, but it would take a while longer to create individual bills. We had been at Milestones for nearly 3 hours at that point and just wanted to leave and get on with our day, and so we elected to just pay for our meals without redeeming our Scene points.  The chaos that ensued from the simple request of collecting and redeeming Scene points - a program that's been in existence for at least 5 years - is unacceptable.  To make matters worse, the waitresses and manager handled the situation in an unprofessional manner. Not only did they give us attitude throughout the process, the manager blamed the entire ordeal on Scene and their poor implementation. As a representative of Milestones, she should have taken responsibility for their end of the partnership.  This was likely my worst dining experience of 2017. I understand that they may be short-staffed at this location, however, the restaurant was half empty and it does not excuse the lack of professionalism and inefficiency.  Off the top of my head, I'd recommend other nearby establishments such as Joey's or Smash Kitchen, especially for larger gatherings.  In conclusion, I strongly recommend against celebrating \"milestones\" at this establishment."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Thursday night and sat on the lounge side. It was good service from our bartender! The Caesar salad was really good along with the rustic chicken club. The waffle nachos would be good if it were just the chip. But the beef didn't taste very good. Besides that. Very good experience."}
{"text":"The girls and I went here the day before grand opening. Great food. Amazing service. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't care that this place is a chain restaurant.  I fell in love with Milestone's about 10 years ago when it was a west coast only franchise and there weren't any in Toronto.  I was pretty amped when they started opening them up in Ontario.  Here is why this place is decent:  +++PROS+++ 1.  The food isn't bad compared to other restaurants in it's class (i.e. Jack Asstor's, Montana's).  Some dishes are really nice -- namely the Thai Noodle Salad and the California Burger (better than a lot of the burger-only joints popping up).  Good stuff. 2.  Because of the competition in the area, I've been able to drop in and get a seat no problem, even on weekend.  Maybe I've been lucky. 3. The Bellini is fantastic.  It's like a peach slushie that will get you hammered. 4. Atmosphere is easy going and the wait staff have always been spot on.  Restaurant/floor managers can be seen regularly on the floor making sure everyone is on top of things. 5. Great location near Queen Street, Chinatown, Kensington, and the clubbing district.  Nice pre-bar spot to go to.  ---CONS--- 1. It's a franchise.  I think that's all I can think of.  This place gets 4 stars because it delivers on exactly what a chain restaurant like this is set out to do.  I can't give it 5, but this place is solid."}
{"text":"Had like 5 different waiters and I still ended up waiting a longer time than usual for their Sunday brunch outside of peak hours. I'll be back to give you guys another try! The sauce that comes with the popcorn shrimp is delicious"}
{"text":"I came here with the entire family and was expecting a good experience.  When we first entered we were given a seat right away.  Seeing that I have a toddler common sense could dictate we might need a booster for a booth table.  The booster seat itself was too high for the booth making it a bit awkward.    We ordered our drinks and oddly enough the kids drinks arrived first and than ours shortly after.  At the time the restaurant was not at all busy.  Our waitress came and took our orders.  We waited and waited and waited some more.  After about 45 mins we finally got our dinners.  The kids at that point had already gone nuts from the waiting.  We got them the kids pasta and to charge $10 for what was given was not very much.  It did come with a beverage and dessert and the kids enjoyed their meal.  I ordered the steak frites and my partner ordered the original burger.  My steak frites came out pre sliced with gravy and Parmesan fries with some horseradish mayo.  The fries could have been crispier but were pretty limp.  However, my steak was delicious hence the awarding of two stars.  My partner said his burger was ok which I take to mean it wasn't all that special.  Especially after all that waiting it was disappointing.    I asked for the bill and a refill after it took me well over 10 minutes to flag someone down who in turn told our server.  After being gone for a whole another server asked if we had got the bill I said no and was very annoyed at that point.  We finally got the bill, paid and left.  Definitely their service is lacking no apologies for the lengthy wait or for forgetting what we had asked for.  Don't think it's worth a trip back."}
{"text":"I had tried the Spring Salad at Milestones at the North York location and I remember it being amazing which is why I went there again. I noticed that they had mushroom soup so I ordered it along with a large salad. Since I am very specific with the dressings, I asked to taste every dressing before getting the one I want. The kitchen and server were so nice and brought me about 10 different dressings. I love them all (except the Ceaser because I don't like that) and I told them to just bring me the salad and I will mix them all up. When I got my salad, they even gave me extra dressing which worked perfectly because I love dressings. The salad is AMAZING! They have interesting dressings that I haven't had anywhere else. The salad comes with goat cheese, strawberries, and caramelized spiced pecans. The whole thing tastes great. The mushroom soup is also amazing, although too small for the price.  I went there again few days ago and I asked for the same thing with the dressings, but this time I only got 3. Not sure what happened with the rest of them. I still enjoyed the salad. The soup came in a different bowl, much smaller than last time. It was 1/3 of a bowl which simply looks bad for the price. I believe for 7-8 bucks I should be getting a decent amount of soup.  Needles to say, I go there for the food and it won't be my last time. I like to treat myself to dinners. If the soup size situation can be fixed, I'd be there far more often."}
{"text":"About 2 years ago we went for an early dinner just after Christmas time. We order our food, the table beside us sat down, ordered, ate their food and left before we even received ours. Our waitress said NOTHING the entire time to us, no apology, nothing. We were okay because we were just talking, but by the time we got the food the experience was kind of ruined so we didn't even really want our food anymore.  We waited to try Milestones again for about a year after that...  This time our service was terrible again, the waitress was very rude and very slow. I honestly can't even remember what I ordered, I just remember it wasn't good. He ordered a steak which was WAY over cooked, and his mashed potatoes were ice cold. By the time the waitress came to check our food he had eaten the steak because he was hungry but he  complained about the potatoes, she didn't really care..I think he ended up getting French fries instead, which were brought to the table by the time we were done eating so they didn't get touched. We paid our expensive bill and left, I remember saying next time I want to come here say absolutely not.   And it wasn't until last night that we returned, about a year later again...  Our server was nice and friendly but the service was very slow. She kept saying \"I'll be right back to take your order\", \"I'll be right back  with the debit machine\", but would return like 10-15 minutes later. We weren't too hungry so we just ordered 4 appetizers to share..2 soups, Spinach artichoke dip and the Asian lettuce wraps. While we were waiting for our food I had to ask for 2 new soups spoons as both of them were dirty and had old food stuck to them. The food took pretty long to come and when it arrived nothing was hot. Both of our soups were luke warm, I was looking forward to it being nice and hot because we were seated by the window and I was freezing cold. Both the soups had rock hard, stale croutons in them. I just sucked it up and ate most of my cold soup, he sent his back and she took it off the bill. The Spinach dip was nothing special and the lettuce wraps didn't taste like much at all. We actually had to wait for a good 15 minutes to dig into the lettuce wraps because the waitress took that long to come back for a quality check, and then we could ask her for plates to eat the off of... I think we all know how messy they can be. Even though the soup was taken off our bill we still paid about $45 three mediocre appetizers...I wish we didn't pay for any of it but both of us hate complaining...  Needless to say, I will never return."}
{"text":"We hungrily stumbled upon Milestones, after a horrendous wait (over an hour) at The Pickle barrel.  We walked in as a group of 7, and much to our delight we were seated immediately! The hostesses were so polite and super friendly.  Our server was enthusiastic and outgoing and took our drink orders right away and they were brought to us just as fast. One of my dining companions has severe, and life threatening food allergies. We explained this to our server, and he said \"you know what, I am going to get the cook and bring him out here so you can explain this to him, I don't want to take any chances\"  WOW! That is above and beyond our expectations.  After she dictated her order to the cook, he vanished to personally make it to her safety specifications.  The server then reappeared, having received the rest of our orders, to top off drinks, and we talked him into taking pictures with us.  He was a very fun guy!  Soon our food was brought out, and I cannot express enough how tasty it was.  Steaks cooked perfectly. Every item was exactly what we wanted, and absolutely delicious. The server checked on us numerous times after that. This was one one of the first times I can say we were treated like royalty. Best experience ever!  If ever I am in Canada/Toronto again...Milestones will be my first dining choice."}
{"text":"Came here on Valentine's Day with my boyfriend, service was excellent but the food was just super mediocre.  He got the chicken parm, with pasta and fries. Pasta had no flavour and the chicken was extremely small, salty and seemed to have a stale kind of texture.  I can't even remember what I ordered because it was just forgettable I guess.  I'm an average height girl and the table was way too high for the seat they put me in, I had to fold up my coat a whole bunch and sit on it to be at a normal height."}
{"text":"My was my first time at this restaurant and I have been to many restaurants and this by far was the worst I heard many good things about milestones and I was excited to go there and celebrate a very special occasion with my fianc√© she ordered the lamb and she wanted the lamb chops and it was very under cooked it was borderline Raj and fatty and last time I checked we live within a first world country where we have the technology to cook army properly they offered her a free dessert as opposed to wecooking her meal or even giving back her money I don't think that I will ever eat at any milestones location because of what happened at this one I would rather spend my money on groceries and cook myself a proper meal if I could give that milestones location Zero stars I would but I have to give them the lowest I can possibly give on this app quite frankly the service was terrible mice my waitress was very rude and I hope she appreciated the fact that I didn't give her a tip because if I were her I wouldn't want to work there either and because of the experience I had at that particular milestones I will never eat at their chain of restaurants again and I strongly suggest anybody that reads this review to steer clear of that restaurant and go somewhere else McDonald's has a lot of better deals anyways"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a date Night here. We had a tuna appetizer that was nice, followed by a delicious Mediterranean Chicken and Chicken Parm. Portions were good, food delicious, good wait staff. I also had a really delicious Cesar. Although I don't prefer chain restaurants, we had a good dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and both times were terrible dining experiences. The first time I came was with a group of 5 for dinner. We didn't order any apps and went straight into ordering entrees. Since we were all catching up with one another, we didn't realize until an hour after we ordered than our food hadn't arrived yet! The hour+ wait time to get our food wouldn't have even been a huge issues for us since we we're having fun talking, but it was the food that was terrible for 4/5 of us.  I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich, and while it may look nice, it was the worst meal I've ever ordered. I understand that they use a Sriracha sauce, but man was that burger spicy! I let my friends who love spicy food try it as well and they said that it was ridiculously spicy. The fries that came with my meal were drenched in salt. Even the waitress said she's never seen so much salt on the fries before. My friend ordered the seafood pasta and said even her dish was way too spicy. We asked the manager if we could order something else and thankfully she was nice enough to give us a discount on whatever we ordered.  The second time I came here was with coworkers for lunch. Given that it was the middle of a work day, there was barely anybody else in the restaurant. I ordered the stacked chicken parmersan, and surprise surprise, all our food came an hour late and my chicken parm was, for some reason, spicy! It was like they mixed cajun and chilli sauce instead of tomato sauce. The food arrived so late that we couldn't even stay to finish our meal because we had to get back to work."}
{"text":"Things happen. We sat for 20 min waiting for our food. It was supposed to come up 'shortly' because the kitchen was backed up. We decided to wait for 10 more min, until they decided to seat a large group of people instead of focusing on the orders in progress. We asked to pay for the drinks and a very rude and unapologetic hostess told us that the order had been canceled.  Worst mimosa ever.  We close with a positive note: our server apologized profusely and didn't charge for the drinks."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Okay drinks.  Nothing spectacular though."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with Milestones. I love their food for the most part, but hate the franchise-y feeling of it, as well as the prices kinda stink!   This location of Milestone's is inside of Empress Walk and across from Mel Lastman Square. It's right above the North York Subway Station, and a short walk from Finch subway station (free parking after 3pm and all day on the weekends).    This two-storey Milestone's is quite pleasant. Most of their seating is on the upper floor, which overlooks Yonge Street and Mel Lastman Square.  The staff here are really personable and efficient.  i would highly recommend the Artichoke and Spinach dip. It's served hot and cheesy, with homemade tortilla chips. It's pretty delish.   I've tried their pasta, it was an angel hair pasta with a basic tomato sauce. Nothing to scream home about to be honest, but not horrible.  Their veggie burger on the other hand it really good! Pretty big and filling, so be warned. It comes with a side of fries.   Speaking of fries, Milestones has sweet potato fries.. And I thought I liked sweet potato fries, but soon realized after ordering them, that I have turned against sweet potato fries. Milestone's SPF come with a side of different salts. It was kinda weird and to me a little unhealthy to be dipping my fry in a pile of salt.... I didn't dig that idea at all.   This Milestone's is a great place to go for a casual but slightly more upscale lunch/dinner. it's a 3.5 stars! A+ ok!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant ce trouve dans un lieu touristique, je n'imagine m√™me pas la fr√©quentation l'√©t√© mais j'y suis all√©e il y a 2 jours en soir√©e, et c'√©tait calme! L'ambiance est tr√®s agr√©able, un peu tamis√© mais pas trop, la musique est √† un volume parfait.  Les plats ne sont pas cheap (17$ pour des pates/poulet au pesto), mais la qualit√© est pr√©sente donc rien √† redire sur ce point l√†. Le service est tr√®s bien et discret ce qui est appr√©ciable quand l'on souhaite manger tranquillement!  A faire si vous souhaitez manger un peu plus classe sans pour autant d√©bourser 50$."}
{"text":"I eat at Milestones a lot. It's near some of my usual stomping grounds and is one of the only places on Stephen Ave open late on weekday nights. I think it's safe to say that I've been there 20+ times in the last three years. :-)   The service is usually good - you can tell that they hire professional servers, or train them to be professional. That being said, I've had some attitude from the servers in the past. But who cares about that?   The food is hit or miss, but usually hit. I love the yam fries and the chips w/ Artichoke dip. They have a decent selection of beers and fun drink specials. Don't sit in the lounge on a hockey night unless you're into hockey, because you won't be able to talk to your dinner partner.  They offer this bucket of ice cream called the \"Break Up Bucket\" which is supposed to be for women who need to get over a guy, or something, but it's totally offensive to me that that exists as an actual menu item.   On the flip side, they have really tasty deserts in general, and I love that brownie so much, I want to take it behind the middle school and get it pregnant.   Overall, Milesones is a 3 out of 5 because I keep coming back and the food can be really good when it's not an \"off\" day, which happens sometimes, and the food is somehow all wrong."}
{"text":"Nothing to right home about , ordered a burger it was pretty decent , the fries were soggy as jeans on a rainy day however , but the service was fast and friendly and the place was clean"}
{"text":"Mile high chorizo, crab 'n shrimp lettuce wrap, their sexy mermaid on frozen Bellini! Lol,"}
{"text":"Wow! What great peach bellinis! And the food was really good. Had the side Caesar (perfect, BIG size) and the goat cheese and garlic naan appetizer. I was comfortably full. The fig jelly with the cheese appetizer was delish."}
{"text":"We like what they've done in terms of decor compared to their old location at Warden and Hwy 7. Very modern feel with high ceilings. You don't get uncomfortably hot and stuffy like the old locale. We've been twice now since it's opened. Food-wise, we give it a 4 because it really is delicious. They are understanding and careful about peanut allergy requirements and will check with the kitchen about which items are ok. Brunch items are yummy (pretty much everything but if you're not a syrup fan but want French toast, ask for it on the side). We had burgers and the chicken club which were both very good.   Service friendliness, 4 as well but the service is terribly slow. Good if you're with friends on a Sunday and want to chat but can be hairy when you have kiddos who can't wait any longer for their food. If they had a way to expedite the kids' orders that'd be great!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place as my friend and I were picking up something nearby. We quickly chose the bar area to eat as we were in a rush. The bartender was our server and he immediately came up to greet us. We were debating to order the special with appetizers and a pitcher of beer but opted to order off the main menu.  Both of us ordered chicken but prepared differently. My friend ordered the Portobello Mushroom Chicken which was highly recommended by the bartender.  I ordered the Bistro Half Chicken which was a good portion and the taste was amazing. The skin was somewhat crispy and honey glaze was to die for. I poured the entire glaze over the check but it was so much, the mash potatoes also enjoyed the bath.  Overall, it was a great experience since I did not expect the food to be that good. The service was also excellent as the bartender was attentive. Although I would not likely return to this location unless I was in the neighbourhood, I would not mind trying other menu items at another location."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Milestones for a few years, and was pleasantly surprised when I went there for lunch this week. They have a great menu with plenty of selections. I like big salads for lunch, and really enjoyed the spicy Asian beef salad.  The restaurant was not crowded, and the service was fast and efficient. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went for a dinner with my wife. The only positive thing were sweet potatoes on my wife's plate ;) Service was poor, we waited forever to get our order and when we finally geti it, the steak that was suppsed to be medium, came rare and bloody. Also, they only gave us 1 cutlery (?!) The worst thing was that the moment we finished eating, they gave us a receipt! I mean, it's not like we came on for a cup of tea! Not going back again."}
{"text":"Their California Spring salad is wonderful!  I recommend asking for the dressing on the side so you get the amount you prefer.  I had it with chicken added & loved it!  Of course, this is seasonal so the berries are at their ripest.  We started with Mediterranean Bruschetta & Spinach dip.  This was the second time we had these appetizers.  They are the best on the list, in my opinion!  They're white chocolate cheesecake is divine!  Other faves were the chocolate molten cake & key lime pie.  This Milestones is connected to the Downtown Marriott Hotel.  You can walk in from inside the hotel.  It is great.  They also accommodate take away orders if you want something better than room service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while waiting to watch a late movie. For a Saturday night, the 20 min wait was not horrible as we were able to sit at the bar with a drink, peruse the menu, and chat with one of the bartenders.  This was our first time coming to this newer Milestones location and the details in the restaurant were not lost on us, including comfy seating and dim cozy lighting cast off from the large cylinder lighting fixtures and pendant lights. I had debated between 3 items on the menu (all roughly in the $18-22 price range): portobello chicken with vermicelli; Mediterranean chicken (2 chicken breasts served with goat cheese atop a bed of chickpeas and greens); or the butternut squash ravioli with crab sauce. I ended up ordering the latter. My hubby ordered the rustic chicken sandwich with the California salad. My pasta was perfectly al dente and served with a lot of saut√©ed red onions, mushrooms, and wilted spinach in a buttery type sauce. I was disappointed to note only one tiny piece of crab in the whole dish, which I had a sneaking suspicion might be the case when I ordered the dish. Despite this, I did enjoy the ravioli overall. I would however strongly suggest to others who may consider ordering this dish to do so mainly if craving butternut squash ravioli rather than expecting significant amounts of crab. My hubby's sandwich was served on a roll with seeds and dried cranberries in it, and was well seasoned with grain mustard and served with tomatoes. The sandwich came with a decently sized California salad with mixed greens, goat cheese, candied pecans, and strawberries.  Our waitress Ainsley was lovely and came frequently enough to ensure our drunks were refilled and to chat with us about our observation that clearer signage was needed to distinguish between the restrooms and the kitchen.  Overall a decent experience at Milestones and would probably come back."}
{"text":"My only expectation from bars are 1) quick service and 2) decent, bad for you food. Milestones delivered on this. Probably wouldn't get the veggie burger again but we enjoyed the calamari and my friend received the shrimp and rice dish, which was good. Waitress with the bob haircut was cute and sweet! I forget to get names sometimes."}
{"text":"How did Milestones get to be such a prominent chain? This was my first time ever eating at a Milestones and I must say it was rather disappointing, especially given the price of the food.  We ordered a bunch of apps (korean chicken bites, chorizo flatbread, baked goat cheese, spinach dip) and all of them were boring and mediocre. The flatbread was probably the only thing that was actually good. The goatcheese had nice presentation but the preparation and consistency of the plated cheese was weird and unbalanced almost like it had been heated on the plate multiple times. For a main I decided to just have a chicken sandwich with fries. BORING. Even with the coleslaw slaw on the sandwich, it was bland as any chicken sandwich I've ever eaten.   In the end, it was a meal and no one seemed to complain while we were there about their meals, but no one actually said anything positive of the food either, so its pretty safe to say I won't be making a point of going again to any other locations, let alone this one."}
{"text":"If you are looking for somewhere generic to hang out at Yonge and Dundas, this is a decent bet. I had been admiring the location of this milestones and wanted to check out the view from above the AMC.   Its on the top floor of the AMC, and taking the elevators up is fun! You feel like you are going higher and highter to an exclusive locale. The restaurant itself is pretty average. I've been to the Milestone's in Burlington and its alot better looking than this one.   On one side is the lounge, which is self seating. The other side is the dining area (which I think has a better atmosphere but I didnt look that hard). I went over to the lounge, as I was meeting a friend for a drink. I snagged a couple chairs along the window, yay I got my view!  I felt like I was sitting in a cafeteria. I dont know what it was, but there was a lack of cozyness to the place. It was super loud and some crazy woman was laughing hysterically beside us. There were TVs in the background...I cant recall if the noise was from them or the crowd itself. I would say the place was 75% full, which is pretty good for a rainy Sunday evening. They don't take reservations.  I had a glass of Reisling, my friend had a beer. I enjoyed my wine! And it was around $8 for the glass, very reasonable. Service was fast and pleasant.  With the rain, people watching was not the best below. I got to see some homeless people checking the garbage cans, others running here and there out of the rain...thats about it.  I dont think I will go back here. Its...a good view and a cool concept, but not that exciting or swanky to hang in."}
{"text":"Came here for New Year's Eve during our stay in Toronto. Luckily could get seated in the bar area as everywhere was packed and we didn't make reservations.   They had a NYE set menu for $45 that looked really good.  Great atmosphere, our waitress was absolutely lovely but unfortunately the food was not good. Neither of our steaks were any good and the spinach and artichoke dip wasn't the best.   Hopefully it would be better on a less busy day!"}
{"text":"Great service, comfortable setting, with really mediocre food.   I generally treat Milestones as a place for a quick lunch with decent salads, or a quick beer with co-workers.   Recently, Milestones seems to have made an effort to create a richer menu, with many new options. While on the face of it, this sounds exciting, the result is not so much.  Their kids menu has burgers, which are pretty good - problem is that kids don't eat spicy dishes.  I've had the Moroccan Lamb, and the amount of pepper dumped on it was just incredible - seemed like a real effort to mask something in the taste or smell of the meat. I enjoy Moroccan food greatly, but there was nothing Moroccan about this dish, except the name.   Will not repeat."}
{"text":"Had horrible experience just now. Went for lunch with coworkers. Felt like no one is happy to see us there at the first place. One of the waitresses was rude and on a comment \"that their menu sucks lately\" she asked \"why are you here then?\". Like really??  The first waitress didn't even try to apologize or anything, but asked if we want to stay or leave. Again, really??? Food was just ok.   Won't be going there again, even thou it is convenient location. Been going there for years, but lately it became a real Eeek!."}
{"text":"We are out for dinner with 5 other couples. Milestones tends to be a reliable stop for a decent meal. But tonight seems to be an exception. Each couple has had at least no problem from missing appetizers to burnt salmon. Personally the steak had a lot of veins and uncooked but it was an easy fix. The other issues just kept adding up. We were give a 10% off discount which we have been told to use it now or later. We are using it now of course! Long story short... We are not returning."}
{"text":"I like Milestones. Venue: All their venues are well decorated, with good chairs/couches.  Food: Good- but not always consistent. I like their appetizers and bowls. I hate their fries - soggy instead of crunchy!! Desserts: Great. Cocktails/ Drinks: Average - not bad."}
{"text":"My first time here but enjoying the treat and friendly atmosphere with my Canadian family. I ordered the Mediterranean chicken and it's very tasty. Strongly recommend this dish. I hope O can clme again soon to try the famous prime rib."}
{"text":"Service was so slow on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered the poke appetizer, which was good. Came with a chutney that was delicious!! I got a beet and goat cheese salad which was amazing! SO got a taco salad which he loved. He started eating out and then the server took it away because it was missing some stuff. Then brought it back. So that was nice of them to fix an error we didn't even notice.   3 stars because of the slow service."}
{"text":"I got invited for lunch as a tradition my department does for new hires. I did not get the burger or steaks because I don't want to be either too messy or choosing the high prices menu just because it's not me who's paying. I read the reviews on Yelp ahead of time and saw that the Pesto Penne Chicken Asiago received good reviews and indeed, it is tasty and I loved it. Except for some of the chicken which was a bit dry. I thought that I wouldn't be able to finish all, but I did. The service was good, except that it took a while for the food to come.   Would I come back? Yes - to try their other food items. And No if I want to order the same thing because I think the pasta was overpriced as we could have done it at home.   They have a bar, TVs, and an open patio - which is good and bad; there was fresh air coming in, but there were also flies that flew around and in front of us during the whole time that we were eating."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of chains, but popped in here for a drink with a friend due to the central location overlooking Dundas Square. The view from the patio is nice: lots of atmosphere and a nice buzz while just far enough away from the madness to enjoy it.   I can't comment on the menu as I haven't eaten here, but the cocktails are gorgeous. $5 Bellinis summer special can't be beat for value. The staff were funny and attentive and overall, it's a nice spot!"}
{"text":"I have been to three Milestones in the GTA this month, had the fish taco at  all three locations, this Scarborough location was the absolute best!  The quality of the fish, taco, garnishing  and the whole presentation was fantastic!  I lost my train of thought half way through my first bite.  I can't wait to go back!   Who ever made this Thank You, I took one of the three tacos home for a snack tonite...yummy"}
{"text":"Went there on Sat Feb 7 for dinner. I had the grilled salmon and my friend had the prime rib. The food was very much below average however the service made up for it. I wasn't there for the service though, we won't be back. This place definitely stays afloat due to tourist dollars, there is no way locals continue to support that tasteless food."}
{"text":"We went there for brunch. We walked in and it took a while before anyone came to greet us and seat us, and we should have known to leave. Our server was a knob. Our drinks were less than average. Our food took forever (although the the place was empty) and there was a mistake on mine. I could not even mention it to our server because he never came back to check on us or offer refills of coffee. We had to go find him to finally get our check. We told him everything about our meals was pretty brutal and instead of trying to make it right  (at least offer us our coffees on the house our something), he laughed, said \"sorry\" and walked away. Brutal indeed. There's so many good places around there, don't bother with Milestone."}
{"text":"Service was great! Had to send back our spinach dio twice as it was freezing cold in the middle! Love this restaurant however every time we have gone to eat something went wrong"}
{"text":"The food was terrible. No attention to detail whatsoever. I ordered the fish tacos with Caesar salad as the side. The fish was not crispy, soft tortilla was not warmed up. The lettuce for the Caesar salad tasted old, and the dressing tasted from a store bought bottle."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in the heart of Mississauga. Usually come here when the family doesn't want to go out of town for a good meal. Went on a Sunday night (in November) and got a booth right away, it was a decent meal at their regular prices.   I always get the portobello mushroom chicken with a side of mashed potatoes... never regret it!"}
{"text":"Some regular long term staff have left.    Standards seem to have been lowered a tad here.  Food is OK they have revamped the menu a bit, so will definitely give them credit for that.  Likely feeling the heat from Joeys, the new bar that opened up in Yorkdale, where the term \"shots\" takes on a whole new meaning, shall we say.....  Friendly staff and servers; Service can be hit and miss depending on unknown factors.  Management needs to buck up a bit!  Note: Waitstaff in restaurant section on the ball and some are just real professionals!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and atmosphere. I had the prime rib which was the best I've had in a very long time. Michelle my server was very attentive and added a wonderful touch to the dining experience. I will definitely return and would recommend Milestones as a must stop."}
{"text":"Not only is the service terrible. But the fact that the manager made light of my disability and made advances to my seeing eye dog makes. E question how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant through Uber eats delivery, I received the plastic bags with the food container inside the plastic upside down! all the food was mixed all over, and it was spilled outside the container as well into the plastic bags, it looked DISGUSTING I also took photos of it if you like let me know how I can forward it to you, it was really bad.  I will NEVER order from Milestones EVER again.  This was very DISGUSTING.  I have photos if anyone likes to see!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but service is courteous but extremely slow...Eaten here twice in the last 6 weeks and same thing both times.  Always seems to be an excuse for slow bar and food service (usually a large group in the back private room - even though remainder of place was 30% occupied).    Ordered a second beer two different times from different people and never received it from either one or even received acknowledgement that they remembered the order but it didn't show up...  They suckered me twice, not again...  Lots of other great options down the block..."}
{"text":"Not bad. We had great service from Monique she was on the ball from the jump, I've had some waitstaff get the initial drinks wrong. Monique was patient with our kids and attentive throughout our stay. My wife had the Balsamic chicken, which she is always pleased with. I had the Mediterranean chicken, which looked amazing in the menu picture, but Monique warned me that the portion was small, so I added a Caesar salad.   She was right! The Mediterranean chicken WAS small...but very tasty. The goat cheese was a nice touch. Looking back I'd say the dish needed more sides, maybe a mashed potato or baked potato?   I can honestly say that after my meal I was still hungry, so I wasn't satisfied as far as being full. Never let our customers leave hungry. Maybe next time there will be more to feast on, on my plate."}
{"text":"Service - Wonderful!  Food - not worth the sticker price.  Prime rib:  Dry.  The fries came in a cone, which means when you get to the mid-bitten of the cone, the fries were mushy.  Portobello mushroom chicken: pasta was stuck together.  Bottom of the plate was just a pool of oil.  Chicken was dry.  Milestone has usually been great, so we'll try it again sometime in the distant future..."}
{"text":"I had yet another disappointing experience at this Milestone's location. My first time at this location was about two weeks ago and service was quite slow, even though we only ordered drinks and desserts. However, I do like the decor and ambiance of this location better than the previous one.  I came back last night and service was once again lacking. Right from the get go, the server seemed very aloof and not genuinely friendly. My friends and I ordered from the Girls' Night Out menu and while the bellinis came out super fast, the apps took forever to arrive. I would've preferred them to arrive at a steady pace rather than all of them together a million years later. When they finally arrived, they were very mediocre. Nothing really stood out to me. The spinach and artichoke dip was blah, the coconut calamari could've been warmer, the yam frites were too skinny for my liking (kind of resembled McDonald's fries but yam), and the goat cheese flatbread was probably the best one but there should've been more bread to go with the goat cheese.  While food was dull but edible, service was unfortunately even worse. Like I stated before, our server did not do a good job of serving us and didn't seem like he wanted to work. Half of the time, he would wander off to the bar section to watch the Raptors game. Like I get it, we all want to know the score but DO YOUR JOB! It took forever and a bit to get our bill and when it finally arrived, it took another eternity to proceed with our payment. He literally set the machine down on the table beside us, and walked away again to watch the game. We thought we had a bad server last time, but this one takes the cake. Why are you a server if you can't even serve customers?! I'm getting riled up so I'm gonna abort now. God bless your hungry soul if you get this gem of a server..."}
{"text":"Came here after work with some coworkers.  The atmosphere was cozy.  We got a booth for the 4 of us.  Lighting was on the dimmer side with a candle on each table, which I personally like.  I know others might like it brighter but for me I like the mood.  The menu was only one side of a large page.  I was expecting it to be bigger as I thought the Milestones downtown had a book type menu, I could be wrong though.  The prices were average for your typical franchise restaurant.  I ordered the tomato sugo halibut which came on a bed of quinoa with tomato sauce, cream topping and green beans.  It was $26 and was pretty good.  The fish could have been a bit more moist but I still enjoyed it.  I think the salads were in the price range of $16.  The waitress was super friendly.  It did take us however quite awhile to get our bill, which isn't so bad as we were socializing for awhile anyways."}
{"text":"We came on a Thursday evening and we had reservations which we did not need. The server we had was exceptional; as she seemed to compensate in enthusiasm what her colleagues lacked. Perhaps it was fatigue, but our server was amazing! We started with Piri Piri I believe it's called, an uninspired blend of chick peas and avocado served with red chips. My son enjoyed his sliders which he placed the bacon from my burger on top ( must watch the sodium at least for a bit). It was my wife's Bday, and she loved the wine and her steak. While pricey, Milestones is worth the trip at least once a year. They even gave her a free slice of cheesecake with a sparkler!!!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time coming to this location. To start off, I ordered a martini and asked for olives. When I got it, I didn't get them. I asked my server if she can bring me a couple, and she brought 6 to me on a little skewer.. Not sure if she was mocking me. Then ordered my dinner which was the butternut squash ravioli( very mediocre) but no bread. What pasta dish does not come with a slice of bread? I asked my server if I can get bread with my pasta. Then when I reached for my cutlery that was neatly placed in the napkin, the forks were dirty. Gross. Luckily my friend offered me his other one. Then I decided to go to the ladies washroom... GROSS! It looked as if the facilities has not been cleaned for the day! Who can go into stalls with crap smeared on the seat and brown stained seats? Finally the cheque comes... I was charged for the bread.  In a nutshell, the service was slow and not very pleasant, bring your own cutlery because they are not clean, don't ask for bread with pasta, and go to the restroom at your own risk.  I'm very disappointed at this location as the other locations are great. I'm not coming back here again."}
{"text":"wow, couldn't beleive milestones sucked this bad....decided to go there for the top chef dinner and watching the series on food network.....wow just not good - the icing on the cake was the strawberry shortcake dessert that was done by dusty on the show piled high with strawberries....lol  it showed up with one strawberry - the cake part was hard as a rock....we laughed and showed to waitress (who was excellent) and the manager gave us $50 in oops money....going to try again in ottawa this week"}
{"text":"What? A clone restaurant owned by the same company that caters Air Canada's inflight meals gets a rating of 4 stars?  Cara Foods runs a bunch of brands from Harvey's and Swiss Chalet to Milestone's at the top of the ladder, and like Darden in the U.S. knows not to mess with the success and quality of the Cheesecake Factory.  I have enjoyed Milestone's for years, mostly for Sunday brunch, where Eggs Benny or one of their \"hash\" creations is my go to.  The menu lineup is refreshingly unique--you won't find many of the simple dishes of other restaurants.  Instead, most of the dishes have some kind of unique twist that makes them stand out.  Recently, I went for dinner and ordered the Prime Rib.  To my surprise, the prime rib was better than the Keg across the street, and less expensive.  I was struck with the realization that the Prime Rib dinner at the Keg has not changed in nearly 25 years, yet Milestone's is alway changing up the menu about every 3 to 6 months.  Hard to get bored of Milestone's!  Pricing is a couple bucks higher than Kelsey's next door, but worth it.  This is higher end dining without the fatwhack to the wallet.  The place is often busy, but they do have a \"call ahead\" service, unlike the Keg where you just wait in line in the lobby or get herded into the bar for the first assault on your wallet.  This is great food with an adventurous twist."}
{"text":"Ok food and atmosphere but terrible service. Went this past Friday night for a late dinner in the dining area. The service was impossibly slow despite it not being busy. Our waitress was the pits. Rude, slow and sloppy. We were planning on making a night of it there but decided not to stay after our meals since the service was so bad.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service with okay food, although when I ordered the chicken sandwich, it was missing the chicken. Our server was extremely embarrassed and humbly apologized. It was rectified within minutes."}
{"text":"I generally quite enjoy milestones.  I find at this location service tends to be especially slow at the bar so unfortunately if you are there by yourself I find that there is very little attention given to you. Not recommended for a drop in to watch a game on Sunday :("}
{"text":"I usually enjoy going to this location but my recent experience made me think twice about coming here. I ordered the beet and goat cheese salad and as someone who expected to receive a salad full of these two ingredients (as its the name of the salad), i got a quarter of a beet cut into 4 small pieces and 3 small chunks of goat cheese. The salad itself tasted great but it needed more of those 2 ingredients if its called a Beet & Goat cheese salad."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Food is good but pricey in terms of quality and portion. There was a fly flying around during the dinner tho. For a restaurant like this, there shouldn't be any flies around. I would say the dinner is good but not at top notch. Service is okay."}
{"text":"I came here with some coworkers for lunch the other day. Looking for a healthier option in food choices, I first reviewed their menus online. I was pleased to see that they had a multitude of options available for various sensitivities and concerns.  Since it was only lunch, I was looking for something preferably under 400 calories and opted for the Grilled Chicken with Vegetables and Jasmine Rice from their sodium reduced menu.  I expected bland... what I got was delicious. The chicken was beautifully grilled and incredibly juicy, I was actually surprised. The Jasmine rice was flavourful as it usually is and there was an abundance of freshly steamed vegetables. A very healthy lunch and completely satisfying! I would definitely order this again.  Sure, I could have easily gone for something a tad more indulgent but right now, I need discipline and with the menu choices available, Milestones left me with no excuses.  Our waitress and (I believe) the Manager were friendly and attentive ensuring that everything was, not only to our satisfaction, but also theirs.  Oh, and with regards to Janet F's comment about Justin G's comment concerning having to walk through the restaurant (bar) to get to a host... no, this has not been resolved. Having never been here before, we weren't really sure where to go so we aimlessly wander through trying to find someone... anyone... to help. The bar keep had no interest in assisting us and merely told us to go upstairs... but we still had to walk through the entire bar just to find her.  4-stars for having their nutritional information readily available online... back down to 3-stars for having us walk through the entire bar before we could find someone to direct us where to go."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times with my family and on a date! The service is always excellent! And food is pretty good as well  The only thing I need say if you come here Friday or Saturday night or a holiday, make sure you book a reservation in advance because if you come there a dinner hours you're waiting for 45 minutes to 50 minutes!  Nevertheless I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for my birthday dinner with a group of my friends. For some people who are complaining but the slow service I thought the service at the restaurant was pretty reasonable I got my food at a reasonable time and everything!  I can't really speak for all my friends but I really enjoyed my steaks frites Entr√©e and I also like the free appetizer dip I got which was a spinach & artichokes dip.  I got a free birthday dessert because it was my birthday weekend but I really wish they asked me what kind of dessert I wanted before they just stuck sparkle or's on it :( The coconut cake or whatever it was called tasted alright but it wasn't like the best dessert on the planet I was really wanting the white chocolate cheesecake! And it's also important to asked the customer if they had any allergies because I could've been allergic to coconut you can't just give people a random desert just like that!  But besides that, I had a good time regardless I will come back here probably for a date or whenever I'm in downtown Toronto again :)"}
{"text":"If you know your kitchen is running extremely slow, I think you should tell your customers that before you sit them. We waited 45 minutes for appetizers, and then another hour for our main course. The people sitting near our tables had similar wait times, and one of them even had the wrong order after all that waiting.  We had the tuna poke, and the fish tacos with sweet potato fries which were very tasty. The main course was an absolute disaster, the mash potatoes had hardened on the outside and was cold, my gravy has been sitting for so long that the top layer has hardened and dried. The sirloin was just wrong in every way possible, cold, chewy, not medium rare, I could go on. My bf's seafood pasta was literally just pasta, no seafood, no sauce, and cold. They did not charge for our meals, rightfully so, and admitted they screwed up and was very apologetic. The redeeming factor is the appetizers which were very good."}
{"text":"This has been the three worst restaurant experiences I have had in 20 years over 9 countries.   The service is reliably inattentive.  Had to wait 20 min to see a waiter, then 15 min for drinks, then 45 min for appetizers.  The \"cheese bread with chimichurri\" was frozen in the middle had a horrible rancid old pesto from last week poured on it.  Literally only 6-7 small pieces of overcooked & cold calamari on the plate for $12.  This restaurant concept could be really good, but the place appears to suffer from extremely poor management.   This was my 5th time to this restaurant & I will insist upon another restaurant from now on with business associates."}
{"text":"If every major restaurant chain could execute a dining experience the way that Milestone's does, the world would bed a better place!  Even though I tend to lean towards the \"mom and pop\" kind of establishments, this has become my favourite \"go to\" place in my area.  The staff is courteous, knowledgable and attentive.  Although there are about a dozen dishes on the menu that I'd like to try, my meal of choice is the Cajun Shrimp Diane.        The atmosphere is elegant and the price points are reasonable.  For my money, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The veggie burger was a great. The service was prompt. However the smoked poutine was probably the worst I've had. The meat was not smoked enough. The pickles were deep fried in some weird coat. And the gravy was below average. But the veggie was great."}
{"text":"Surprisingly my first time at Milestones after passing by this restaurant many many times. I think what has kept me away is their menu pricing and after receiving our bill today I can agree that this place is a little on the pricier side for dining however, with a price comes great service. Went there for lunch with my sister and sister-in-law and asked for a booth. We went around 2pm and the place wasn't packed at all so we were able to get a seat very quickly and at a booth. Apps can range between $14-$16 while mains are around the $17-$24 mark. Although this may be standard due to the location I believe there are some cheaper options around downtown Toronto. The only downfall to their menu aside from pricing is that there isn't a very broad selection of items. I wish they had a few more pasta choices or main dishes. They serve the standard steak, burgers, sandwichs, salads and on weekends - weekend Brunch. We got a calamari to start that came with a sweet mango heat type sauce on the side as well as on top. The calamari was excellent and so good that we ordered a second. For mains, we got the old fashioned burger with fries, the big breakfast, and a spicy chili bowl that came with chicken on a bed of jasmine rice. The spicy chili chicken bowl was the only dish that came a little underwhelming served in a bigger bowl that it needed. Overall, our service was excellent. Our server was very attentive, friendly and checked on us just enough. Something that is expected with the price of the menu items. We skipped on dessert as we were stuffed but I am sure there dessert would be delicious. The dessert menu does only have 4 items on it (churros, red velvet cake, cheesecake and a chocolate duo). I was hoping to see their funnel smores poutine on the dessert menu but did not see it.   Overall, this place was great, service was excellent and although I wont be going back too too soon it is a nice treat to go to before a movie across the restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited on a Sunday evening. The restaurant wasn't really busy. The host and my server were both helpful and nice. I ordered the coconut calamari which didn't really taste like coconut but was still delicious and comes with a sweet chilly sauce. My friend ordered the taco salad of the featured menu which was incredibly huge. I got the Supreme Fries which technically is a appetizer but the portion was that of an entree which was very tasteful I jus wish the peppers were jalape√±os."}
{"text":"Visited milestones for the first time on Victoria day it was about a 30 min wait for a patio table.  Although when we were finally seated there were multiple empty tables available on the patio not sure why the wait.    The drinks were great I had no complaints. I had the belini bowl and sunshine mimosa.  The pasta was okay nothing special.  The staff are really friendly but the food took a really long time to be served."}
{"text":"I ate at this Milestone's during a recent business trip to Toronto. It is situated at Dundas and Yonge near the Eaton Centre and is up on the fourth floor so that you can look down on Dundas Square.  It is a large restaurant which was quite busy for a Wednesday night.  I was impressed on how organized they were.  When there was no table ready for us, they sat us at the bar where we could order a drink while we waited.  Within about 20 minutes, we were brought to our table.  The food was very good.  We shared an appetizer which was the baked goat cheese.  It was good but not extraordinary - the toasted flatbreads were quite good.  The main course was Harissa Chicken.  The chicken was moist and was flavoured nicely with the harissa sauce.  It was quite spicy which is rare in a chain restaurant.  I also really liked that I could order 9 oz of wine instead of the usual 5-6 oz glass.  The server was efficient and really knew both the menu and wine selection very well.  Overall, a very good meal  in an excellent location."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Milestones for years, but I decided to take my significant other to this location for her birthday this year. I wasn't disappointed with my decision.   Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and approachable whenever we needed something. We ordered the mussels & frites, and the angus beef top sirlion, which came within 15 mins. The waitress ensured she placed the dishes in front of the correct person, which I thought was really considerate.  My other loved the sauce that went with the mussels. I thought my steak was a bit on the chewy side, but nonetheless, it wasn't bad.   They brought out a couple scoops of icecream w/ chocolate cookies, burning with a lit sparkler for my other's birthday.  Overall, a pleasant experence with the service and food. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Brie flatbread and the bread was stale.  Husband ordered the new Montreal smoke meat sandwich. So much cheese it totally took away the goodness of the meat. Too bad. Why do thus have to put so much cheese on everything????"}
{"text":"I'm sad to report that we've stopped going to this Milestones. The quality of the food has dropped dramatically, to the point where it's coming out cold or missing ingredients, pretty much every time we go. I hate having to send back food, or worse, putting up with what I received and still paying the large bill at the end of the meal.  It's a shame, this place was a go-to on a weekly basis for my family and I. Hope they can turn it around, but I doubt I'll ever go back to find out."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice and the most recent time was for a birthday. The group I was with was pretty big and they strictly told us where ever you were sitting was set for the night due to separate bills.  When we arrived, we got water promptly and I ordered my Miami ice beverage- the drink is non-alcoholic. It was made with mango puree, ice tea and fresh mint. I liked it for a non-alcoholic drink as it was something out of the ordinary, not just simple juice or flavored soda. I also really like mojitos so this would be the closest thing I could get.  It was time to order our food. I really didn't know what to get so I opted for pasta. My usual pasta dish that I would order is a seafood fettuccine, they had a cajun seafood fettuccine. I asked if there was another option other than Cajun since I can't take spicy food and the server said they could just do tomato. I was really looking forward to the pasta as I was hungry since the food was taking a little long.  *please do take note that even though we were a big group, they split our groups up so essentially my group was 7 people.  Once I had I got my pasta I thought something was a little off and eventually I found this pasta burning my mouth. I barely touched the noodles and tried to finish the seafood. Even my bf who takes spicy food thought this was hot.  I know they were busy as my other friends in the group were waiting for their food and I don't even think i got a refill of water as i remember finishing my drink and water and feeling thirsty especially after the spicy food.  Lastly, it's weird how you get the cheque right but not the food. Anyways, I do like Milestones and usually do enjoy it especially the other locations. Disappointed... Hoping for the best next time!"}
{"text":"This is my first Review and I am unsure if there is a right or wrong process. I decided to do a review because our family eats out a lot and I have too many reviews stored up.   I have been to this location several times on dates with my husband or with our children and there is always an issue. It has a nice chill atmosphere, friendly servers and Managers who aim to resolve customer dissatisfaction.   Before I go further i must say that 90% of the time the servers are exceptional. The issue most times has to do with the quality of the food, dirty wares and cutlery, the skimming down of the portions with silly fillers or over cooking of Calamari etc.  My husband took me for a quick lunch date recently. The restaurant was not busy but we had to wait awhile for service. The waiter seemed busy but her service was good. We ordered Belini's, Beet & Goat Cheese Salad, Calamari and Artichoke Dip which we shared.   The Calamari was ok, however came with a ton of fillers, in the past their portions was adequate, it has steadily reduced. We barely nibbled on the salad as it was mostly inedible with slimy and very wilted greens. Sadly, the food standards have fallen to the wayside. The artichoke dip has also gotten smaller, though still a favourite of mine.  We plan to take a break from visiting this location and do hope that Milestones Scarborough make an effort to correct the above observations."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!  Only person at the restaurant was the bar tender, he took our order and it took forever, finally brought appetizers, the plate is there but no cutlery or plates, no body around, then we see this guy that looks like a waiter and had to speak really loud for him to look at us, we ask for cutlery and he says he is our server bcs everybody is gone. We finish the appetizers and waited and waited for food, there was not that many tables. Finally food comes in, it was ok and then more ppl start coming to the restaurant, the poor waiter running everywhere to try and service everybody, we waited again for him to take our plates. We ask for dessert and Holy I cant believe that we were still waiting forever, then we see poor guy coming with plates for the table beside us and the people complaint why their food take forever as well. So we kept waiting and finally we get the desserts. Of course when it was time to ask for the bill everything was so fast. So I did tell the waiter to please make sure to tell the manager that we had the worst service ever and to make sure and staff accordingly his restaurant. Never ever ever coming back!"}
{"text":"came here for my mom's birthday dinner.  The place was clean and overall atmosphere was quaint and cozy.  Our Server Adam made us feel very comfortable and was able to make our experiences quite comical and fun.  Hey knew his food, and was very honest about the menu. The service was very efficient, and even the manager came by to ask how we were doing, which goes to show that customer's are satisfied and being looked after.  Here's the breakdown.   The appetizer: Mediterranean bruschetta, and spinach artichoke dip 4/5  Entree: kobe style bucatini bolognese 4/5  no dessert....unfortunately with the two appetizers, it totally filled me up."}
{"text":"I've passed by here a few times, and from my back-in-days experience at Milestones hasn't always been an impressive one.  Epecially the older locations that have the same old decor, this particular location right by Richmond HIll Silvercity was up to date with a modern- contemporary design.  Our server, was very accommodating, especially when we couldn't decide on which bottle to order he recommended we try a small sample before ordering something we'd regret, good move! We opted for a bottle Rosemount to compliment the bruschetta!  The wine! had no obvious complaints since we were avid fans of RED wine.   The bruschetta; 4/5 presentation was lovely! and at the same time you can't really go wrong with bruschetta as it compliments the vino....  overall ambiance was great! and this place is definitely a hot spot if you love your patios!"}
{"text":"After hitting the CNE we decided to meet up with a few friends in the club district, however when walking around the area, our hunger built up, and thankfully Milestones was there to save us.    Saturday night the place was extremely quiet, but we took advantage of their bar seating area.  The place was clean, not too loud, and our server was very friendly.  For drinks I had their Tempranillo red, and Iriana had a Belini! :) both drinks were satisfying. For food, we decided to do shareables with their Spinach artichoke spread served with crispy nachos.    Overall the place is nice, as I have been to this location before, and have never had any issues! after we finished our meals we decided to move ourselves to their patio since that too had plenty of seating. :)"}
{"text":"Passing by on Enterprise and Birchmount road it was nice to see Milestones had opened up a new location, away from its old looking, previous location at highway 7 and Warden. The new design and decor is definitely a big PLUS from what it used to be, now trying to compete with other popular chains such as Joey and Moxies. Their service was satisfying as we just came in for a few glasses of wine. Nonetheless the ambiance is cozy, clean and fresh!  Though we didn't order food, they've got a great selection that can cater any audience. Thankfully this location is close to home, with sufficient parking,  but I'll need to come back to ensure I dig in and try some of their popular dishes.  In addition do look into their weekly specials which offers some great specials on food and drinks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the quiet atmosphere, even though they were busy. I had a light fare with a small plate and a side salad. The salad was remarkably tasty!!"}
{"text":"Nice set up and clean! I've been there twice and had the same server... not too sure what his name was but he was great both times! They have great drink specials which I highly recommend to take advantage of! My last visit I ordered the calamari and it was amazing"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with the overall service... food is good..."}
{"text":"Drinks taste good but service is slow and NOT industry standards. Waited half hour to be told ran out of an appy with no compo offered. I didn't even have anything else coming and lost my interest. First drink took awhile to be offered too."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite after work yesterday and had a pretty disappointing experience. Loud music blaring from the bar (apparently DJ on Thursday nights ... but it was 6:00?) ... music in the dining room was on but couldn't be heard due to the music from the bar. Now it was just competing noise (pick one or the other). Was seated by the kitchen and bar and wait staff station ... was so noisy we had to ask to be moved. Still not much better.  Food was just ok and our server was fine. Seems like this is a poorly managed restaurant. Saw a young girl (hostess maybe?) walk through the dining room past our table carrying several rolls of toilet paper?? Not sure where she was going with these as she was heading away from the washroom area. All in all a very disappointing experience. Had heard this was recently renovated but honestly I found it to be a very cold atmosphere. Felt like a Boston pizza or something similar. Will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with some friends after attending an event at the Ted Rogers Center for Management (Ryerson University).  We had a large party, so we ended up with the casual bar seating with high chairs.  Much to our dismay, it was quite loud in that section and our group of eight was essentially fractured with four of us having one conversation, and the other four engaged in another.  There happened to be a \"Girl's Night Out\" Tuesday special that we were told we could participate in, despite being a mixed group, so we went ahead and ordered 4 bellinis and 4 appetizers for $40 -- which is good value any way you slice it, but unfortunately the appetizers didn't really deliver.    Toronto definitely nails ethnic food in pretty much every category, but when it comes to bar food or classical American food, you really see the difference in taste.  I wasn't really impressed by any of the appetizers (shrimp, baked cheese, artichoke, sweet potato fries), but the one thing I did enjoy was my drink (called the \"Caramel Kiss\") that was beckoning me ever since I saw a photo in one of the many menus lying on the counter."}
{"text":"Lobster & Crab dip was how we started our meal.....it was very runny (liquid) and fishy tasting.    Prime Rib was cooked ok, but then slathered in gravy, or some really thick au jus, and was just OK.    I had crab legs...... Not sure how any restaurant can serve snow crab without a cocktail fork. The taste was great, but I literally had a battle with my food!    Jess, our server was great.  Gracious, even as we expressed our frustration.  If not for the customer service of Jess and Ravi the manager, I would have only given them 2 stars!  I appreciate that they listened and offered to make thing right!"}
{"text":"Coconut calamari is delicious! the salmon and fish tacos are great too! On Wednesday they have date night for $50.00 you get two full size entrees one appetizer and one dessert ."}
{"text":"Just tried their new Chef Menu launching nationally today with some cool twists on old favourites - check out my review on the new menu items on my video blog. http://youtu.be/sCT9pXvJC9w"}
{"text":"This location of Milestones came to my rescue, when I tried to make reservations at the Yonge and Dundas location, they gave me some trouble.   I had their butternut squash ravioli and cookie for dessert. It was a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"NEVER COMING BACK ! Ordered calimari to start. $12.50....guess how many pieces I got.. 5! 5 SMALL pieces of calamari!  Unbelievable. Such a waste of money. Just a disapointment. There's so many other places that give you a large plate full for about $10 such as Rosa's Place Weston Road and Langstaff in Woodbridge which is amazing and The Open Cork on Queenway which has a good portion of calamari.   Also, I got my starter after my boyfriend FINISHED eating his skimpy $8 Cesare salad.  Slow ass service.   Drinks are expensive too. Might as well go to a fancy place if I'm going to pay $10 for a cocktail and $7 for a beer.  Later I talked to our understanding server, and explained how skimpy the calamari was. She understood exactly what we meant and explained that the manager wants to go for \"the high end look. smaller portions, and expensive costs\"  See ya Milestones!"}
{"text":"Le club sandwich au poulet grill√© √©tait bon et rafra√Æchissant. Les frites sont ordinaires, ce pourquoi je conseillerai de les changer pour leur salade. Les salades sont bonnes, un peu ch√®res pour un plat sans viandes ou poissons, mais rien √† redire sur le go√ªt. Le service est excellent."}
{"text":"The The Old Fashioned Burger stuck to its name. Very simple and tasted real good. The real deal, if you will. However, it did get a little dry and I ended up putting in some mayo and ketchup.  The Piri Piri Dip with the Manchego cheese, Yum!! I'm a fan!  Yeah the service wasn't all that good. They seemed new. Could hear them talking and planning how they were going to clean up after we were done. They made us wait a good 15 minutes to get our to go boxes. Correction: I'm NOT a fan"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite before a Stamps game.  Yeah, it's in a mall, and it sounds like it's a chain (well, maybe a small chain), but this place was pretty nice.  Just the right amount of swank inside, but not pretentious.  I ended up going with a Caesar (for you American's, it's basically a Bloody Mary with Clamato instead of tomato juice....and they are yummy).  For my meal, I went with a steak.  I went with the steak which came with three different dipping sauces (I think there was a bbq, horsey/hot type, and a \"gaucho\" sauce).  I would have to say the cilantro and spiciness of the gaucho sauce stole the show.  I could have downed it like a shot!    The service was efficient.  Made it to the Stamps game before kickoff!"}
{"text":"Food is overpriced for the kind of quality and taste you get.  But it's a cool place to hang out with friends and has great Bellinis."}
{"text":"Good service, a large spacious seating area and a vibrant atmosphere even on a Wednesday evening. I'm not a fan of milestones but this is one of the better locations I have been to and I think staff play a large part in that. Unfortunately I ventured outside of my usual fare and tried those lettuce crab wraps...I don't know what I was thinking. The waitress, without asking, offered to lift it off the bill which was greatly appreciated. My friend enjoyed his fried calamari however and I just continued enjoying my Brown Cow :) Kahlua, chocolate milk and vodka :)   All in all, it makes for a nice casual and youthful date place with comfy booths and the game playing in the back. It wasn't too loud also, well , that was until I walked in :S   Tip: if you accidentally ate too much then go outside and take a walk by the pretty purple fountains! Such a calming view out there :)"}
{"text":"I was in town for a meeting, and we decided to meet our clients here for a discussion.   There was no one in the bar area and so the server began dragging the metal tables across the tile floor all around us. We couldn't hear ourselves speak.    We asked her politely if she could wait 10mins, so that we could finish her meal - but she continued dragging tables and chairs around. We had to ask again and she was rude about it.   Then the manager started doing the same thing, and we had to ask her to stop and she snapped at us in a very rude way, and said \"OKAY, FINE WHATEVER YOU WANT\". Then another waiter started moving the tables again.  It is really poor customer service to have to ask 5 times for people to stop dragging furniture around you, while you are eating lunch.   There was no one else in there, the place was completely clean and organized - but they insisted on looking busy and dragging tables and chairs around, no matter how many times we asked.  F' this place, if they don't listen to such a small request from their only customers in the entire restaurant.  Take your business to a place that actually values their customers"}
{"text":"I've been here many times over the years.  This is a great choice if you want some good drinks and some good food.  It doesn't disappoint but it doesn't blow away your taste buds either.  This time I believe they have a special going on - 3 meals (apps/entre/dessert) for $25 from a select menu.   I ordered the grilled salmon with pineapple salsa, jasmine rice and seasonal veggies.  Overall the salmon was done nicely, but it could have used more salsa to give it a nice citrus-y flavour.  The atmosphere is nice - dark and brooding with a hint of sexy.  Great for friends or a first date.  I must say the service was really nice - our server knew the menu and made some suggestions.  Polite and genuinely nice.  If you are checking out a menu at the STC this is a good place to grab a meal/drink before or afterwards."}
{"text":"Had about 1.5 hrs before our movie started and weren't sure if we wanted to eat dinner first or wait until after the movie was over and eat dinner then. So we started walking around and the first place we saw was Milestones. Well. Went inside and wanted a table but was told that the wait was going to be about 45 minutes. There were plenty of empty tables and I'm sure they could have found room for a party of 2. Well. We left and decided to go elsewhere. However, I have been here before and this restaurant tries to be upscale with the setting and how nice everything is. If this was in the States, it would be the type of place that you'd want to enter with a dress shirt or else you'd feel uncomfortable. However, there were plenty of people in t-shirts, shorts, sandals.   Well. I wanted to come in and just have a couple of drinks but after looking at the menu with a couple of drinks already inside me, I felt a little hungry. Probably the drunken munchies starting to kick in. Well. I wanted to get an appetizer (maybe 2) and share it with my friend who didn't want to spend too much money so I ended up just getting the yam frites. Now. for $8, I'd expect some unbelievably good yam frites or just a ton of them that I could share with a couple people. Very disappointed because they were not $8 worth of deliciousness nor were there a lot to share as they state on their menu.   For the main course, I ended up getting a burger because I wasn't feeling fish or a steak. Chose to get the californian burger and I do have to say, the fresh homemade avocado salso was pretty delicious. The burger wasn't bad either and for the $12.99 price, almost made it worth it. But it wasn't.  Now consider that they price meatloaf at $19.99, I must now state that this is restaurant seriously holds itself way to high than it should. Hell. The beer was also expensive. Probably because they gave us a pint in a glass that seemed to be very expensive.  If I do come back, I will be getting the burger again because it was very good and I can get good steak and fish elsewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"For date night we came here to enjoy a lovely dinner. The staff is amazing and friendly and hands on... the food i ordered rustic chicken sandwich ... the brie is amazing on it! I am so full and still have food to take home! We will be back and I am certainly a happy customer! We even had 2 servers making sure we were happy... a date night for the books! My date has a gluten allergy and our server went out of his way to make sure that everything was in order so that they weren't going to have a reaction. Gluten free options are amazing."}
{"text":"Milestones is not the place that you would want to go for good service. Both times I have been here we have sat in the bar area and the servers had just been horrible at there job. The first time we went in was for a bday and we ended up waiting forever to get our drink orders in (which was all we were having) and she didnt even come around to see if we wanted seconds. So after being there for so long we finally got the bill (which took almost 20 mins from us asking her to bring it over) It was just horrible.  The second time we went in it was just me and the bf. We ordered the spinach dip (DONT GET) and the croquettes. The pork croquettes were OK but they are from the top chef menu so i was expecting thatr WOW FACTOR but didnt get it. The spinach dip we sent back. Not only was it watery, but it was suuuuuper bland. There was no flavour to it and it tasted like it had been microwaved which was even worse. Im not a food snob but there are certain things that should be made fresh and i feel like those were one of them. The server was not engaging at all. Off the bat you could tell she was having a shitty night and was pissed off. She never came to check to see if our food was ok. Another server came to take it away and when we asked for the bill it took 15 mins before our server came over and asked \"would you like anything else\"......so i assumed the other server never told her. Again we waited for the bill for too long.......It sucked so bad i would never go back. They have no grasp on keeping people coming back because of there location they dont need to. And you can tell there staff doesnt give a shit either. The front dorr told us there was a wait for the dining room and when i went to the washroom there were soooo many open tables i was like wtf?? They told us to sit in the bar cause we would get served right away but we didnt. It was one bad service experience and i would never go back again."}
{"text":"Typical Milestones location ... Service was a little slow but food was great and drinks were great . It's a fantastic place to come for a drink and hang with Friends as they have a very nice bar area !"}
{"text":"A - List. Recommended. Yep, it is in Market Mall. Too Bad or Too Awesome, depending on your perspective. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. I enjoyed the mushroom soup and portobello mushroom chicken. Both were delicious. The service was well-paced and efficient, more business-like than folksy friendly. The decor is interesting with long sight lines and a very high ceiling. You can sit closer to the bar with the plasma tvs or head for the back of the restaurant which will setup the illusion of being somewhere other than a mall. The food is priced higher than traditional mall restaurants and the quality of the food is reflected in the price. Order an entree and they will happily bring the food on two plates to split, no problem. This wouldn't be my first choice for a special night out but I feel the quality of the food and the decor within a mall warrant a 4 of 5 stars. All mall food should taste this good."}
{"text":"B-List. If you want food and a drink there are better places. The decor is banal save for the large raised saucer seating situated in a strange part of the room. The drinks are good and expensive; nine dollars for a strongbow? Seriously? Can a glass get any larger? The food appeared to be good and there were no serious complaints by all. The help is attentive, seemingly friendly but with a touch of invitational facade. The discerning eye, ear and palate knows differently. I would not recommend this restaurant for a special occasion. However, if you are passing by, this place may fill the void. They have location and this will likely carry them. There is better around the corner."}
{"text":"Avoid the Chef's cut Prime Rib steak.  This is not a steakhouse.  Sent it back 2 times. Came back soaked in salty gravy and just very upsetting for $30."}
{"text":"among your standard bar and grill (Jack Astors, Montana's, Moxie's etc.) this is my favourite."}
{"text":"Appetizers here are great! I would recommend when coming here to aim for a shareable dinner because these items come out the best- excluding the calamari.  All mains that were ordered by my group were less than average. The burger and curry chicken were ok but the shanghai noodles were absolutely disgusting.   Dessert was great, nothing to die for, and I would recommend sharing the apple crisp- it's hard to do that wrong.  Drinks were delicious and looked great and a highlight of the meal, while service was cold and not frequent.  Over, it was ok. Just ok. Disappointed that my main was literally inedible- especially for the price. I've had better from a food truck!"}
{"text":"Sadly I won't be returning even though it is within walking distance. Too bad as I like the chain but this one isn't up to the name. The service is fairly good but the food is sub par. As my first visit was opening week I figured I would give them a second try after a couple months. Sadly strike two. No third shot at this one when there are so many other good restaurants in the area. If you just want to have a beer and watch a game the lounge has some nice screens but cross the road for your meal."}
{"text":"Milestones is one of those wonderful multi-purpose restaurants!  It is a wonderful stop for a delicious meal, a great place to have drinks, a classy yet affordable place to take a date or a fun atmosphere where you can relax with a beer and watch a sports game on one of their large screen televisions.  First off, the food is really good at Milestones and it is definitely reasonable.  I have been there plenty of times where I have ordered an appetizer, a main course, a dessert and a drink and my bill came to $30!  For food, I have A TON of suggestions.  For starters, I usually grab at their famous hot spinach and artichoke dip, the garlic caesar salad or one of their seasonal house made soups.  For mains, they have a wonderful selection so you can eat light or heavy.  For a light dinner, I enjoy their grilled seafood salad, the vegetarian thai noodle salad or the Shanghai noodle stirfry.  For a heavier dinner when my stomach is about to eat itself, I LOVE LOVE LOVE their portobello mushroom chicken, complete with yummy cream sauce and accompanied with linguini.   And to top it off, MARTINIS MARTINIS MARTINIS!  As a lot of you can tell from my yelping, I LOVE martinis and Milestones makes a good old mean one!  They have their delicious signature martinis, which are all unique in their own right.  My favourites from the signature martini list is the Caramel Apple martini, the Bikini Martini, the Caramel Kiss martini (however this one is sometimes unavailable), and the Blackberrytini.  They also have their classic vodka and gin martinis for people who can hold the liquor and strong taste of the drink.  All martinis are usually around $10, which is not bad considering you can pay sometimes $20 at downtown bars.  As well, Milestones has great locations around the city. With two restaurants already well received downtown and uptown in North York, this newer location at Yorkdale offers up the same amazing stuff.  After a long day of shopping or looking to grab a bite before a movie, this Milestones at Yorkdale is a great new addition."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch up at the bar. Service was good soup and salad was similar to other milestones Restaurants. Place was busy and is located in a strip mall with the door facing younge street. You park away away and then have to walk around to find the door. Wold be nicer to have it closer to the taking lot."}
{"text":"the atmosphere was really nice but the the menu was very limited i didnt really like that. What i finally ended up getting ribs which was a decent choice and mashed potatoes. If your looking for drinks and setting thats your place. Unless you only want steak then i wouldnt recomment them."}
{"text":"Wow - I am shocked that I am giving Milestones a ONE*... this is so unlike me.. and even more so unlike THEM! 1. Maybe it is because I am use to Vancouver food and yes it can be quite different than Toronto seafood. 2. Maybe it is because I try to avoid chains to try independent restaurants but I have never had a problem with Milestones in the past. 3. Maybe it is because of crazy downtown nights that lead to a bad night. 4. Maybe this is just a bad Milestones, but I had no expectations going into this after reading previous reviews from Yelpers. 5. Maybe....................  We were going to watch Fiddler on the roof with my Boyfriend's parents - they suggested M4, to which I did not think would be a problem. I think Milestones is great.... the place looked grand, separated by the lounge and a large dining room. The manager at the front kept everything in order, from directing people with/without reservations to the appropriate hostess. I found the table where my group was sitting. The waiter was courteous, but clearly he was having a very busy night as we did not see him very often. Waters took long to get to the table and he would leave to complete another task although we were ready to order and did not even get a word in before he dashed off.  The calamari and flatbread was ordered to share.... while it had taken a while for it to come out, the waitor apologized that it was taking so long and that he ordered the mains in soon after so that we would make it to our show. The flat bread was actually one where you had to assemble everything yourself - kind of like a deconstruction: with goat cheese, cranberry sauce, salsa and a corn relish...it had some good flavours, but I was not impressed by any means. The calamari plate was small and cold.... tasted soggy as I was chewing it and there was so much left over diced onion that the proportions did not seem right. My guess is that one dish was waiting on the pass while the other one was catching up, leading to this disappointment.  As soon as the appies were finished, the mains came out, good timing I guess? I ordered the seabass with shitake mushroom vinaigrette and seasonable vegetables.... looked nice.... tasted.... gross. The fish was completely overdone, and burnt all around the outside with me pick it all off. The inside was dry and I just did not want to eat it. The minimal shreds of shitake mushrooms were submerged in a large puddle of oiliness that was extremely unappetizing. The rice, although has a nice light flavour, was clearly made from a mold, but it was as though glue was used to assemble it. It was hard and difficult to separate.   Seasonal vegetables you say? I was given one strand of brocolini, a small baby carrot, and a half slice of roasted squash... presented by itself on the other side of the plate. Very lonely.  My boyfriend had the veal chop in a curry squash sauce. The veal was extremely hard to chew, very firm on the exterior and the sauce was overpowered with curry, I would have never guessed there was squash.  We took a chance on dessert, and ordered the pot de creme, similar to a creme brulee texture, but in a butterscotch flavour, without the burnt sugar. Instead, there were chocolate crumbles on top. Looked like a fancy butterscotch pudding, tasted like butterscotch pudding with more cream.  Milestones may have lucked out because this location is so convenience for so many people. With so many restaurants in the main core, I know there are lots better. Wow - I think I've said some not so nice things but if you're in the heart of downtown Toronto, I expected you to dress to impress..."}
{"text":"Had miso glazed cod which sounded amazing, it tasted good, was a generous portion and tasted healthy. Came here for a late dinner wasn't too busy and patio was nice in the summer."}
{"text":"Despite this being a chain restaurant, it really is a trusted operation. The service is friendly and efficient. The drinks quench your tired throat. The meals are satisfying. I've been here a few times and have no complaints. Of course the restaurant is huge and you can feel small in an impersonalized setting. But who you are with makes all the difference.  I came her with a girlfriend and after our girly drinks and our pasta dinners, we had such a long, fun conversation. We were never rushed or expected to leave. Why would they? They have ample real estate to accommodate walk-ins!  I enjoy coming here equally with large groups and small groups of 2."}
{"text":"Better than expected. Portobello chicken dish was very good. Portions are good. Service surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I've been to Milestones recently and the food is pretty tasty. I enjoyed one of their salads. However I find them rather pricey. For the amount you spend it doesnt seem worth it for for me.  The server was really kind and we got our food in decent time. I think I willl only go back on a special occasion when someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 3 on arrival seated right away, the waiter george was helpful with menu food arrived in good time and was was excellent pricing was good definetly will dine there again."}
{"text":"To celebrate our daughter's birthday, we decided to take the family to Milestones (Vega Blvd, Mississauga).  We had all been there before & were always happy with the food & service but it had been a while since our last visit.  When we called & made the reservation, the hostess asked if it was a special occasion & we told her we were celebrating a birthday. When we arrived we were seated & told someone would be with us shortly.  Over the next 15 min, several servers walked by but not 1 looked at us or stopped to take our drink order.  Frustrated, we finally flagged down a server who offered to put in our drink order. We ordered Sangria, a coke & water.  We asked for 3 glasses for the Sangria & mentioned we were there for a birthday celebration hoping to help speed things up. At 6:45,, our server Keisha, finally came to the table with a coke & water.  Not particularly  happy, she said she had just returned to work after being off for a month and was feeling a little overwhelmed.   No apology was made  & it was obvious to us she didn't want to be there.  She also said the Sangria wasn't ready yet and asked how many glasses we needed even though we had just mentioned 3 to the other server.  When she finally returned with the Sangria, she advised there were no more wine glasses left so brought tumbler glasses instead. Not knowing when she'd be back, we decided to place our orders.  We ordered 2 apps: the Captain's Coconut Calamari & the Mediterranean Goat Cheese Platter.   Our daughter wanted the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Crab Sauce.  She was so looking forward to her dinner since she had seen it listed online & thought it sounded delicious.  The Sangria was literally 90% ice & tasted like fruit juice.  If you took away the ice, I would be surprised if you could even get 2 glasses from it.  We also noticed another server bringing wine glasses to another table which we had just been told  they ran out of.. The Calamari arrived at about 7:15. We were told our other app wasn't ready yet?  Really? It tasted o.k. but the breading should have been crispier, not soggy & underdone.  When the 2nd app finally came 15 min later, there were a few pieces of focaccia toast with a small amount of goat cheese spread/dip.  The apps were 1/2 price but neither of them were even worth that.  Our dinners were brought by several servers (none being Keisha).  One of them who we knew from previous visits (Patrick) noticed our daughter's Ravioli was NOT what she ordered.  It was in a tomato sauce, an item not even on the menu.  He asked our daughter if she wanted it instead.  She reluctantly decided to take it not wanting  to wait another 15 min since the rest of us had been served but after trying it & not liking the tomato sauce, she decided to send it back & get what she originally ordered.  Patrick apologized for the mix up (the first apology we received all night) & put a rush  on the order.  It did come quickly but was noticeably smaller than the ravioli she originally received.   When our server brought the bill, we asked to speak with the manager.  At no time did she make mention of our daughter's birthday even though we had mentioned it twice.  She came back telling us she gave the manager a 'head's up' but that he was busy with another table.  I guess we weren't the only unsatisfied customers that evening?  She also said she was unaware we had waited so long initially before being served.  At no time did she apologize which we thought was odd considering how the night had unfolded. When the manager finally came, he apologized & offered us a 1 time use voucher of $50 for our next visit.  It would have been better if he had just taken the amount off our bill since the whole night was a disaster from beginning to end.  I also mentioned we chose Milestones to celebrate our daughter's birthday but at no time was there anything  said or done to recognize that. It's the little details that make a restaurant stand out from the pack but when the service & food don't measure up, it's clearly a reflection of bad management.  If you are a server & unhappy in your job then find another job.  If your restaurant's kitchen isn't being managed properly then it's time to find another manager.  It's really too bad because atmosphere is really nice & as I stated before, we had always been very happy with the food & service previously.  But... The whole evening just left a BAD taste in our mouths and I won't be recommending this Milestones to anyone anytime soon."}
{"text":"One of the few places open as we strolled around Calgary on a Sunday afternoon, enjoying the outdoor art. Good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Service was very good, that's the only thing positive about my experience.  The Prime Rib I had was so bad I wasn't even willing to give them a second chance.  Cut bait and move on.  Updated to 2 stars as someone has reached out offering resolution. Not that I want any but shows good customer service, again."}
{"text":"I enjoy Milestones. The food is consistent, tasty, and commercial. The truth is they have a very good menu, even for those that are vegetarians. The pasta stuffed with butternut squash is awesome. The sauce is wonderfully creamy, and they pair it with pecans which have a spicy finish. Very tasty.  I also really like their california spring mix salad. It's awesome. The candied pecans are wonderfully sweet. The salad is a beautiful array of greens and purples and reds, and the dressing is light and just a little surgary.  Last, I highly suggest ordering dessert. My SO and I both really love the Cookie, and my sister is a big fan of the white choclate cheesecake. Also wonderful."}
{"text":"Like many of the reviews below, the service is actually super amazingly good. Don't hate.   I guess it's the food, but also the menu. It's okay. There are MANY other places to go to in Toronto, but if you're really craving some basic food, then here will hit the stop.   As any chain, this looks like any milestones. Good thing is that it would be great for a party dinner or so if you want to do that... Without going out later at night aw there's not much around.   The food is okay. It's not bad whatsoever, but okay.   The salads are pretty good portions, I would say just right.   Overall I wouldn't come here again unless I had a gift card. But again, service was amazing so don't let this review get you down!"}
{"text":"It took over 45 minutes on Sunday night to get appetizers with less than 25% of the seats occupied.  Overall the service was terrible.  The food is average."}
{"text":"DEE-LICIOUS food, fantastic service, happy ambience.    Before hitting the Princess of Wales theatre (spoiled!) about a block away, my friend and I met here for Wednesday's Date Night.  Although not on a literal 'date' (ha!), we wanted to partake of the highly praised $50-for-2 menu. :)  Our shared appetizer was the hot artichoke and spinach dip with tortilla chips (disappeared sooo fast).  Extensive wine selection, $5 off a bottle...but we did the teetotaller thing and had iced teas.  On to our entrees:  I had pan-seared scallops with bok choy and curry sauce...oh YUM.  Tender, flavourful, great portion.  My friend had the butternut squash and goat cheese ravioli (the vegetarian option) and LOVED it.  Our shared dessert was an absolutely heavenly giant warm soft double chocolate cookie, topped with vanilla gelato, chocolate sauce, and caramel.  BLISS.  The server knew we had to run to our 7:30 pm performance, so she was thoughtfully prompt in bringing us our food, our bill, and our goodbyes.  Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"What happened to Milestones? This location should be shut down. It's doing a disservice to the entire brand.   Sat on the patio for dinner. It was filthy and overgrown. The quality of the food has gone downhill as well.  The inside of this location has been the same for over a decade, which was fine when it being maintained. However now it's become a worn out, dingy restaurant that shouldn't be allowed to operate in a very competitive area.  Not sure why they removed their unique grilled chicken salad and introduced fairly standard fare that's readily available at any other chain.  I was positively angry by the time my family's dinner was over thanks to the decrepit atmosphere, confused staff and mediocre food.  I used to love this location, but not anymore."}
{"text":"waiter was really nice and patient; food made me feel nauseous, super over priced, dessert was good though"}
{"text":"I am sorry but I have to say The Chimichurri Garlic Bread is a fail.  It tasted ok but the garlic bread was like being soaked in the sauce and melted cheese for too long, the texture turned too spongy.   I tried the tuna taco here a while ago.  Each order came with 3 big pieces of taco.  2 pieces of tuna were of good size on each taco.  However, the two deep fried advocados on the side impressed me better.   For tuna taco alone, I really prefer the one at JOEY.  The summer sangria was made too sweet.   I prefer the white sangria at Moxies on York Blvd.  The Bellini here is good though.  I like to see how the little plastic deer or giraffe get drowned in my drink :p  I do not know why but I am never a fan of Milestone.  It might be the ambiance.  I find the lighting is way too bright around the bar and lounge area.  However, I don't mind coming here with my bf because he likes that there are good selection of beers on tap, and I agree.  We just noticed there is STIEGL GRAPEFRUIT RADLER on tap now!  The service is ok.  Our orders were taken and delivered properly every time.  This Milestone has the nicest patio and I am sure it makes this Milestone stand out."}
{"text":"I literally just had the best meal at the most unexpected place ever!!!!! My colleagues from work all have birthdays in December and last minute decided we should go to milestones. This is a place that I never hear my friends talking about, never really see any ads for and definitely didn't want to go to. I was miserable that they chose this place and was actually reconsidering my invitation out.  Long story short I ended up going and I am so thankful I did. The customer service is phenomenal!! My friend called to make reservations and was put on hold for five minutes. Take into consideration that it's Wednesday. She ended up getting hung up on and then had to call back (I know this is negative but wait for it). When she called back they hung up again. She finally go a hold of someone and made the reservations and all was great. Five minutes later the manager called her back to apologize and offered a free app when we came. So we got one free app but when we mentioned it was two peoples birthdays we got another free app!!! The apps were delicious we had a goat cheese with fig jam option and a coconut calamari option and a date night app of spinach dip with chips.   The best was yet to come however, I had the butternut squash ravioli and it was AMAZING !!!! The ravioli had goat cheese on top and tiny sweetly bell peppers on top that pack a lovely punch it was absolutely delicious. I have never been so surprised before.   To top off a great meal, both birthday girls got a free slice of cheesecake and not one of those miniature barely bite cakes but a rich and large portion. Everyone had a great night and I will definitely eat going back!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday! Looks really nice inside! We had the yam frites and Asian chicken bites and they were both delicious! The Asian chicken was a little too sweet but still delicious. Yam frites came with 3 sauces and were excellent! I split the California burger with Caesar salad with a friend and it was enough for both of us. I also had a Bellini since it's Tuesday and it's cheaper and it was sooooo amazing! Servers were kind too! Everything reasonably priced. Would come again!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review at the restaurant, because I have tons of time apparently since we have been waiting for half an hour for a dessert that is literally a cut piece of cake. We've been here over two hours and have not been served with any care for our time or experience. I've approached the waiter to remind him of every course - no improvement and no apology, he spends most time talking to other people and there is no awareness. This is the worst experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times in the past two weeks due to its proximity to my hotel. Two of those times I was served by the bartender in the lounge area and he's been really good. Once I sat upstairs and service was much slower, despite being practically empty.   I've enjoyed the fish tacos (although they could use some avocado on them) as well as the Asian chicken bites, garlic cheese bread (skip this, not that good) and I also had a side of veggies that was amazing. I would go back for that alone! It was the chick peas, with spinach and tomatoes. Yum! I also had the California Benedict last week for brunch, and it was decent.   Food is good, drinks are great and service is mostly what I expect from a Milestones restaurant. It's more 3.5 stars, but I bumped up instead of down. :)"}
{"text":"Came here before a movie at the AMC. Normally I wouldn't even think about hitting up the Yonge and Dundas area on a Saturday night but the movie we wanted to see was sold out at the Varsity.  Anyway, we had just over an hour to kill, which would have been good for about two drinks. But it took about ten minutes to get seated on the patio, and then it started to rain so we eventually moved inside to the bar. It was quite busy and the few girls working seemed to be confused. Took ages to get our drink order in, and even then we had to wait a long time to receive what we ordered -- nothing more than a pint of beer and a glass of wine. The girls were preoccupied with some other drink order and even stood around now and again to chit-chat with each other.  My pint was warm and not even filled to the top. They stuck our bill in a glass for some reason because I guess they're trying to be fancy. I suppose I should give them another chance and maybe swing by again on a weekday and have dinner, but it's rare I am even in the area so it seems unlikely.  Ultimately the service killed it -- in a bad way. Patio seemed nice and spacious and the overall layout appeared to be a good place to hang out in, but had to deal with too many scatterbrains who left me with the impression they had little experience in the service industry."}
{"text":"My dad wanted to come to Yorkdale for a stroll because he hasn't been here in 20+ yrs.   So 1st restaurant we saw at the parking lot of Milstones. So we went in and they said it was a 20 min wait, that was fine because we had time. There was a lot of empty tables but the mall just opened at 11am. So I'm sure they didn't have enough wait staff to serve, hence the wait.  Stewardess was apologetic and thanked us for our patience.  Our waiter was super friendly and funny! He made our visit here pleasant :)  Our orders: 2 cups of coffee 1 cup of hot water  Surfside Salad ~ My salad was pretty good, salmon was cooked to my liking but the shrimp was a bit too salty and charred. I love the baby teardrop peppers they added to the salad.   Orange Basil Salmon ~ My dad thought the salmon was a bit overcooked, but I tried it and it seemed ok to me. But he said overall it was pretty good.  Chicken Sandwich ~ My hubby took a bite of his sandwich and realized there was no chicken at all..lol our waiter apologized and got him a new one with new fries. The original fries were soggy...but 2nd one was a bit better but it was a bit dark..liked re-fried fries. But it was still ok for him.  Just minor kinks but still ok for us. We would come back again. :)"}
{"text":"We went here with a group of 6 for dinner.  Not everyone got there at the same time and they were very relaxed and accommodating as we waited for everyone to  arrive.  The menu  had good variety including some fish and vegetarian options. You can also substitute gluten free pasta in any noodle dish. I  had the Thai Spicy Basil noodles which were tasty but not all that spicy. There were only two things that made this a 3 star and not a 4 star... the bar service was very slow,  and when we left people were literally stalking us for our parking spot.  Apparently if you don't go early parking is impossible."}
{"text":"The food is bland. Workers don't seem to know what they're doing. Steak is cold, and fries taste terrible. Bacon seems to be bought from No-frills, and overall place seems somewhat unsanitary. Receiving a glass with dirt from the last user."}
{"text":"This location is great, especially in the summer.  The patio above Dundas Square is amazing. Service at this location has always been good too.  The only real downfall is that the food is a bit pricey and mediocre at best.  I have never walked out of there thinking to myself \"that meal was awesome\", more like \"I'll try something else on the menu next time\".  That being said, they have a few tasty items, and decent weekly specials.    It's more of a place to drink, socialize and grab a snack for me!"}
{"text":"This is a chain. With notoriety like that there are some pros and cons before even trying the food.  There are certain expectations I have with chains and Milestones definitely lived up to it.  First, great for groups. Service was excellent.  Selection.    The reason, we went here was for their Bellini's! Hands down my favourite drink! I had been searching for places in this city that made these Slurpee style.    We were a large group that had every variety of eating habit.  The most notable one, gluten free. One of the greatest thing about this place is they offer another menu that is entirely gluten free. Wonderful!  The dishes have never blown me away. I do find for large groups it tends to give a good variety  for a reasonable price.  It's a great place for okay food and good service.  IN other words, when you have a large party and you have to have a Bellini, go here!  To me, I would award this place a 3.5 for the Bellini and gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Place looked fabulous, wait staff was friendly, and courteous yet...Service was horrible. The staff were really slow, and took forever to get they're attention for any kind of service.  Usually you would think they would check back with you after an allotted period of time, but that didn't really happen. And you would think after your plates been taken away and you've been given the bill they would want you to pay promptly to clean up and set table again. NOPE, waited over 15min to pay my bill, honestly I should have just left, because that was just absurd, Next time I will seriously consider that. Food was alright....That is all. Maybe it will be different for you, but yeah I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Eh I'll pick a Milestones over a Pickle Barrel every single day.  My partner and I prefer the Yonge-Dundas theatre over Scotiabank, and this is the easy choice for dinner. The service is pretty good, last week our server seemed a bit overworked he wasn't at the table very frequently, but he was nice and trying, which I just appreciate.  I try to not get pissy when my order is weird, ordered a veggie burger and got a salad with bacon on top? Or another time when I ordered a burger and it came with no toppings (I order my burger with everything). But they fix mistakes quickly with no attitude.  I like the sugary hangover in a glass bellini, with the little plastic monkey.  If you want inoffensive food, that will hit the spot, with friendly staff. Just a nice dinner before a movie, perfect place. I don't want to sit there for three hours having dinner, I just want to relax a bit eat a burger and have a drink, and not be annoyed.  Also regarding those photos someone else posted, paper towel in an over full washroom isn't that bad, not like someone peed all over the floor and it was left, sometimes places get busy, and could have been whoever had to check their got busy with something else and was on their way to change the trash. And the kitchen floor was dirty, which can uhh happen in the middle of dinner service. The counters looked clean."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst meals that I've ever had. And it was expensive to boot. My biggest tip? DON'T COME HERE.  1) The service is slow. From being seated to finally receiving our entree took over an hour. Mind you we went in at 9pm and less than half the restaurant was full. By the time we left the staff was closing up the restaurant and we STILL had slow service.   2) Our calamari was of the strangest consistency I've ever eaten. The breading was bizarrely adhered to the calamari as the squid was paste-like instead of bouncy and slippery. Makes me think of paste breaded with chicken finger covering. In fact, the meat tasted so processed and was presented in such a strange way (as strips instead of the common calamari rings) we googled it and came across this  http://www.foodservicedirect.com/product.cfm/p/206691/Pana-Pesca-Tenderized-Breaded-Squid-Strip-5-Pound.htm  Yup breaded squid strip. I'm pretty sure they used this or something awfully similar to it because it tasted nothing like real squid. Disgusting is an understatement. Don't expect to cover up the flavor with dipping sauce either. They are nasty as well.  3) The chicken portobello was awful. The chicken came totally burnt smothered with some sauce that had next to no flavor. The pasta was overcooked angel hair pasta topped with some cheese. It tasted like crappy grade school cheap cafeteria food, except worse and priced at $21 a pop. I would not eat this again even if it was free.   4) The butternut squash ravioli was mediocre at best. It was probably the best dish during our dinner because it was not completely disgusting. Then again, I'm pretty sure you can get something similar at your local mall cafeteria.  5) The classic dirty martini tasted awful. If you asked for it neat expect to see a few suspicious ice cubes floating around. However, it was extremely boozy which was helpful in light of the disgusting food.   6) The service was horrible. Our server was slow and very unattentive. She was nowhere to be found for most the night (hence the long wait time) was brusque and harried when she did talk to us. Our water was never refilled and waiting on her (despite an almost empty restaurant towards the end of the night) was a trial in patience.   Overall this place seems to be completely focused on maximizing profit at the cost of quality and service. Will be interesting to see how things pan out as we came in with a voucher from the hotel and still left feeling bitter and robbed. Please don't come here to eat. You're better off going to subway and buying a sandwich."}
{"text":"I want to say I like this place. I really do. After all, it's right beside the Cineplex, super trendy looking and the patio is such a hot spot imo. Unfortunately, the over-priced, mediocre food and underwhelming service just isn't anything special. What I do like is their $4.50 Bellinis on Tuesday after movies! Yes please. And the ambience is quite nice."}
{"text":"We came here the other day to watch the blue jays game. The place is very nice amazing location and design. But that is it drinks are over priced food is OK for the price you pay. One thing I really hated about this location is the washroom location. I hate the location of this washroom it is all the way at the back. You have to walk like 5 min just to get to washroom and come back. This is pathetic for a bar. People drink and need to go to washroom more often so put the washroom is a decent location."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. The French onion soup is a must try and their burgers are pretty good as well. The staff is quite friendly and did a good job. A good place to go with a bunch of friends for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant with excellent pricing, food portions and great service.   Menu has everything from burgers, salads, pasta and appetizers.   Weekend brunch is delicious and I recommend pancakes or the big breakfast.   Kids menu is little pricy but restaurant does cater to families as they offer both high chairs and booster chairs.   Best to try out the Miami Ice. Yummy."}
{"text":"Everyone has that one liquor that takes them forever to get back into after they've been sick on it.  For some, vodka.  Many others, tequila.  For me, it's Bailey's \"Bacon and Bailey's Eye-Opener Irish Cream Liquor\".  I've got this for Milestones.  I've never been sick there, but I'm definitely sick of them.  Firstly, there are the \"oh-you-MUST-try-them\" Bellinis, the signature drink at Milestones that is a vividly coloured champagne and rum slushy that comes in a martini glass, garnished with a plastic zoo animal on the rim, and triggers giggly, vapid conversation that is normally reserved for that point in \"Sex and the City\".  For the rest of us non-Cosmo-drinkin' wannabes, the beer list is minimalist in nature.  When friends drag me here, I suck it up and hope that the food will compensate.  It doesn't.  There's nothing staggeringly bad about it, but nothing jaw-droppingly good either.  Each and ever time that I remain hopeful that the meal will make up for my experience in an over-stylized place where it seems the people who want to feel cosmopolitan but aren't really seem to be collecting.  It doesn't.  Typically, it comes in a big pile of \"meh\".  And not even garnished with a plastic mammal."}
{"text":"Great place, spacious and friendly staff. Super overpriced however and the food is too bland for my liking. It's like they only use salt and pepper to season their food or they use sauces on top to cover it up. Needs more flavour!!! The mushroom gemelli pasta had no flavour whatsoever. It was like eating boiled pasta thrown in olive oil with mushrooms in it... food definitely looks fancy but the taste does no match up to its looks.. need a lot more vegetarian options as well. The garlic bread did taste good tho! The appetizers were the only Good part even the dessert was no good."}
{"text":"Just ordered from ubereats and OMG my meal sucked. Im never ever trying out this place again. What a waste of money! For 35 dollars for one meal i was expecting something decent. Instead i got a stale chicken no where close to crispy chicken and stale vegies in cole slaw. Cole slaw was not even 2 bites. Shame for sending such food. Im sure the take out boxes cost more than the quality of food you sent without even considering. These ppl use very bad quality.."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. The servers are rude and ignorant, they are basically talking to each other and doing nothing."}
{"text":"Came with with my girlfriend, sat at the most perfect spot in the restaurant, between the patio and indoors. Best of both worlds.  We were there around 5pm, and it wasn't busy. Girlfriend had the Caesar, they ran out of the Worcestershire sauce and sub in the horseradish which made the drink even more tasty.  I had the Heineken as the tap for Heineken caught my eye.  We opted for some finger foods, so we had some spinach dip.  The dip was good and the tortillas were ok on par.  All in all it was a nice day and I would come back for a quick drink."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip in the area and this was a conveniently located option for dinner one night.  The wait staff was generally very friendly, and the burger I ordered came out in a pretty reasonable amount of time (the waitress did apologize for how long it took, but it hadn't been long enough to warrant such an apology anyway).  I was a little disappointed that the burger had that inexplicable texture and perfectly cylindrical shape that implies that the patty had at some point been frozen.  Other than that, the meal was pretty good."}
{"text":"This milestones is near the movie theatre just outside of scarborough town centre. Lots of parking due to the mall being right there, looks like any other milestones from the outside.   Upon entering, there was no greeter and when the greeter finally came, she was not really a bubbly or cheery person. After being brought to our table, it took forever for the server to come.   Everything from here wasn't too bad, we order an appetizer to start - the baked goat cheese. Wasn't that great... Anyways, onto the entr√©es - my girlfriend ordered a pasta and for myself, a burger. The pasta was average, nothing special. Burgers like the one I ordered can be compared to ones like at moxies or pickle barrel because they're just a burger with a fancy name cooked well done and with a side, except this one tasted terrible. I don't know who thought some sliced smoked ham would taste good in a burger - terrible combination.  The only thing that was a little more than decent was the server refilled my drink quickly.  2.5/5"}
{"text":"This Milestones is located at Warden and 7, just beside the McDonald's. There's never much parking around there, so you'll have to really park near the pub, just a little west of there in the parking lot.  Servers are very attentive, food is mediocre. Definitely try the Bellini, a fruity alcohol drink .  Overall, it was like most chain restaurants. I ordered a burger, fries on the side and a corona w/lime. Nothing special here, but it wasn't bad.  3/5"}
{"text":"Who knew Milestones had a brunch menu?  Well, I do now.  Brunch items ordered: Big breakfast Santa Fe Shrimp Eggs Benedict  Regular items ordered: Mussels Frites  Big Breakfast: French toast, eggs [any style], bacon, sausage, ham, home fries Surprisingly large for Milestones. French toast - not much egg, made from a baguette, served with syrup. OK Eggs - what can you say? they didn't screw these [2 eggs?] up.  Good Bacon - cooked, but not crispy, 4 strips. OK Sausage - tasted like a mix between an hot Italian sausage and a chirizo. Good half [of a large] sausage Ham - nice grill marks, not too salty. Good slab of ham.  Home fries - they came with a weird salsa type sauce, and some weirder cheese. I'll pass on the sauce next time.  OK Verdict - will get this again next time  Santa Fe Shrimp Eggs Benny: Tasty sauce, soft egg, avocado slice .... tasted good (to the person who ordered this). NOTE: Had a bite and got the foulest taste from the onion. Not sure if it was marinated in something. Verdict - I'm glad i din't order this, but that's just me. The other diners seemed to really like it.  Mussels Frites: Medium-large serving of mussel in a [supposed] light curry sauce. Although you couldn't even smell any hint of the curry, so we couldn't even tell what kind of curry it was. Frites - super thin shoestring cut served in a glass. Very good, but a small serving, par for the course at milestones no? Verdict - enjoyed by the whole table, sufficient [starter] to be a meal for small appetites."}
{"text":"I came to this Milestones location last week with a couple of my friends, and I was really excited to have a great lunch with my friends whom I have not seen in a hot minute. I decided to get the wings, whilst one of my friends got the Rustic Chicken Club and specifically asked to make sure that they substitute the bacon for avocado because of religious purposes, and my other friend ordered the Old Fashioned Burger with no bacon. Everything was fine until we actually got our food served to us, now do not get me wrong I personally enjoyed my wings but when it came to my friends, I could not even believe that they thought it was okay to serve them what they did. My friend Faizah who ordered the Rustic Chicken Club ended up getting a sandwich filled with bacon, and when we asked our waitress that she had gotten the order wrong she seemed very bothered and did not admit to the mistake. Instead, she basically admitted to us that there seems to be no actual communication with the kitchen staff and the waiters because the whole bacon in the sandwich situation was not her fault. When she brought in the new sandwich, I could not help but laugh because it looked very unappetizing and after tasting it, let's just say it tasted not so good, but my friend gave it a 5/10, would not order again. The sandwich had zero flavour and barely any chicken in it, which is funny because it's supposed to be a rustic CHICKEN sandwich. I wish I took a picture of it because that was very disappointing. Now comes the worst part, which is my friend Jenny's food. When she received her burger it looked like a regular burger at first but after 2 bites of it she realized that there was literally no sauce, no cheese, and the meat tasted like cardboard, it was so dry! She was going to suck it up and just finish eating it but if she is paying her money for it then no thank you! So we end up calling our waitress and Jenny lets them know that she is not enjoying her burger and she also points out that there also was no cheese, even though the only thing we asked to take away was bacon! The waitress just took Jenny's burger away from her without even asking if she wanted a new one or wanted to order something else so we all just assumed she was going to bring her a new burger with cheese in it and hopefully a bit more flavour. She waited and waited and nothing came. After 15 minutes she comes back to our table and asks us if we want to order dessert, of course we were confused and we asked her when her new burger was going to be ready, to that, she says, \"Oh I didn't know you wanted a new one, I'll bring it to you right away.\" We probably waited a good 20 minutes to receive the burger which she took home as takeout. The only good thing about this experience was that the burger was on them (thank goodness). Just when she thought that her terrible experience of the day was over, the horror only continued. We were talking on phone that night and she told me they gave her the same dry, sauceless burger again except this time they added a little piece of cheese that barely even covered half of the sandwich. Also the worst part, despite her repeating to the waitress time and time again she didn't want bacon, of course, the burger had bacon in it! Talk about a terrible experience. The funny thing is, Jenny actually tried the same burger in another Milestones location and she enjoyed it so for her to get this dry tasteless burger was very shocking. I was thinking about having my birthday party there in like 3 weeks but I don't think I will."}
{"text":"Empty restaurant. Made us wait 45 mins for a table. We're told we could not wait in the bar as they were backed up, and we would not even be able to get a drink. A party of 6 or more came in after us and was seated right away in the bar. Bad customer service on your hostess' part. When we finally did get our table, the restaurant was empty! We're told there is no prime rib (supposedly your signature dish??? How do you run out of your specialty item??) also no crab. We were there at 630 pm. Our server was very friendly so I don't fault her in any way. Food was pretty garbage. You guys need a change in management or need to step up your game. Awful food, awful experience. Will never be back. Not impressed milestones. We spent a good chunk of money here. Will never ever return. Not a happy customer at all."}
{"text":"Before I start my official review, I must address Yelp.   Dear Yelp, I do not recognize the terms 'Happy holidays' or 'Holiday season'.  I live in Canada, and here it's Christmas, not some silly politically correct nonsense.  So don'ta maka me smacka you while using a non pc and very stereotypical Italian-esque speak. /endrant  Located on the very busy Stephen Ave walk, Milestones is easy to find, situated right on a busy corner.   The decor is decent inside, there are plenty of places to sit and it doesn't feel cramped.  I ordered myself a prime rib beef dip.  It wasn't too bad.  Tender and juicy.  Unfortunately, it wasn't nearly worth the $14 it cost as I didn't start crying from complete happiness after eating said sandwich.  The server was friendly, however she seemed to be over-burdened during the busy lunch rush and I didn't see anybody else serving tables in the lounge.  I maya trya this place againa, however, the food should be worth the cost next time.  I demand it! Bwahahaha"}
{"text":"Another restaurant where you would like the 4.5 option.  Excellent and attentive service.  Spicy Thai Basil Noodles were delicious, and I had them spiced up with sriracha sauce.  Recommend you do the same.  Crispy chili chicken also recommended.  The restaurant willingly splits dishes and if you aren't really hungry, that's a good option.  On a warmish evening, be sure to sit outside."}
{"text":"Very Meh.  We went to this location for drinks and apps after a movie. We waited for a while to be approached. The bartender served us, but she was rushed and flustered. Felt like we were discouraged from ordering food, as she wanted to take our menus away, to \"get them out of the way.\" When we told her we wanted apps, she said okay, then went to leave, when we wanted to order then and there.  She never checked on us. She forgot to serve us water, which we ordered. Our crispy chicken bites were soggy, and calamari was also soggy.   We just dropped some cash, sans tip, and left."}
{"text":"This is my worst restaurant experience of 2013. First, they forgot my drink for like 15 minutes. Then, they forgot to bring me mayonnaise. I had to ask 3x, by the time the mayonnaise arrived I had finished my fries. Finally, they charged my credit card almost $10 more than what I signed for. Unbelievable. Please go to another restaurant, there are many nice ones close-by."}
{"text":"I'm down for Milestones anytime anyone suggests going. It's safe to say I've tried a lot of the food on the menu. If you really have no idea what to order, I would recommend getting one of their signature dishes. On the menu, it's labelled a 'M'. There's also veggie and gluten free option. What I love about the menu is the simplicity of it. Personally, I feel if there's too much on the menu, it gets really overwhelming for me as I tend to be indecisive when it comes to ordering food.   The only reason why I would give this particular Milestones a 4-star instead of 5 is because of the wait. The day we went, the restaurant was not particularly busy, however the food took a while to come for whatever reason. However, we had a lovely waitress and I would not mind coming to this Milestones again."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the brunch I had here: It was terrible. I really should have listened to the other reviews and NOT ordered the steak and eggs--but it was that kinda day and the pictures were so tempting so I just went for it... DO NOT. FORGET YOUR CRAVINGS, STICK WITH THE CHICKEN PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM AND DON'T LOOK BACK. Prime rib hash was also soooo bad and the fruit bowls were just literally diced melons in icing sugar. Parmesan potatoes were cut so inconsistently that some pieces were under seasoned and others were too salty. Please skip the brunches here and stick with those 4 for $40 Bellinis and spinach dip on Monday nights with your girlfriends.    You have been warned."}
{"text":"Milestones on Highway 7 and Yonge used to be a Japanese restaurant and before that an Outback Steakhouse. Those businesses we quite unsuccessful. I'm thinking it's based on the location. One thing that Milestones did well was create a beautiful patio. With their daily drink specials they should do relatively well in the summertime.  So we want to Milestones on a Thursday evening and once we arrived there were no more tables available in the patio. We dined in the dining room. Our server who we won't name, wasn't that great of a server, not to us anyways. We first received our waters and my glass had black particles in water so I got a replacement. She was not giving us much attention. The experience that she was providing to us was not very engaging. As much as I pushed to initiate conversation she was not very interested in making small talk. When we received our food and started eating she did not once ask how our food was or if there was anything else we needed. Being a server in the past, I know that's the basics of what u should be asking.   As for the food that we ordered it was pretty good. The Stacked Burger I ordered was great along with the redskin fries. Only issue I had was the portion of fries that I received, it looked like someone in the kitchen ate half my fries before serving it. Also in my opinion the burger should have been on a different plate as the width of the plate was too short and when I ate the burger the toppings were falling off the plate. There were no complaints about the Pesto Chicken Penne Asiago. It was a good pasta dish. Overall with a little better customer service this place could have great potential. Jimstar Out!!"}
{"text":"Get literally anything here. The service is good and the food and drinks are better.  My favorite is the chicken sandwich with waffles replacing a bun that comes with sriracha.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Why is this place rated lower than Jack Astor's which is across the parking lot from here? Jack Astor's sucks (see my review). This place was awesome. Great food and the service was very attentive. She even gave me a free slice of cake when she heard that I was visiting from the States!"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday evening at roughly 5pm, and was really disappointed at this particular Milestone's. The food was mediocre at best, and the service was not great.  Service:  The restaurant was fairly empty when we got there, but we were seated in a far corner away from all the rest of the human population for some odd reason, and the seat was a two person seat with a really small table. Our water did not come for a while, but we didn't mind too much because we were busy looking through the menu. We waited about 20 min for our appetizer to come, which is fairly normal. When the main dishes were brought up however, the server had no intention to take away the big tray placed in the middle of the table that took up all the table space, nor the sharing plates we had in front of us. I actually had to pile the plates together and call the server back to our table to take away the plates so we can actually start on our main courses. Our water was not refilled until the end of our main course. The waiter did not pay much attention to our tables until we asked for the bill. No cutlery was given to us until after our appetizer was brought up, and the waiter only dropped by twice (appetizer and water+bill) for the entire meal. Keep in mind that was before the evening rush on a weekday, and the restaurant was somewhat empty. I was really disappointed with the service, so 1.5/5 at most.  Food:   We were both rather hungry so we ordered the appetizer platter ($23) to start. We ordered a grilled chicken Caesar salad ($14) and a seafood fettuccine ($18).   Appetizer Platter:  Appetizer included spinach artichoke dip with tortillas chips, flat bread, chicken wings and chicken bites.   Spinach Artichoke Dip: The cheese in the dip was not melted properly, quite a bit of it was still stringy when brought up, and it definitely wasn't easy to dip. The artichoke was in such big chunks that the only way to pick it up was with a fork. We were expecting more of a nacho style chips for the dip, but the long red tortilla strips was served instead. The salsa was literally tomato chunks, there is barely any sauce to be dipped, and we ended up finishing the chips with sour cream.   Flat bread: The bread had a weird spice in it, it definitely would need an acquired taste and I am not a fan.  Chicken wings: It is more of a teriyaki chicken wings. The wing itself is really small in size. Each wing is about 2 inches in length. Nothing special.   Chicken Bites: The chicken bites were the only thing that we liked. It is a little spicy for our liking, but it had a unique flavour. It is more of a thai chicken bites, so when we saw the few strips of vegetable/fruits on top of the bites, we expected mango. Nope, it was cooked cucumber. But overall, the chicken bites were not bad.  Overall: I give 2/5 for the platter, because we did like the chicken bites. The dip definitely could use some improvements.  Seafood Fettuccine: The fettuccine has a good flavour but it was heavily sauced, and the mussels were so fishy that it made the entire dish tasted fishy, which is an indication of the seafood not being fresh. At a restaurant that charges close to $20 for a fettuccine, one would expect at least somewhat fresh seafood to come out of it. It was not bad but I was disappointed with the quality of the seafood. So that was a 3/5 for me.   Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad: One can't screw up a Caesar salad right? Wrong. This is by far the worst Caesar salad I've ever had. The dressing was runny and overly creamy, it definitely was not mixed with the lettuce very well. There were barely any bacon bits seen, and the croutons were stale. The grilled chicken was alright. 2/5 because...well, the chicken was alright.  Conclusion: I've definitely had better service and food for the same price. I do not recommend it unless you have no where else to go."}
{"text":"Just got back from eating here for a family birthday dinner. Great location, great ambience and I love the set up of the place. The food was delicious.  I had the Mediterranean Chicken.  Having the calorie count on the menu deterred me from some of the other items, but no regrets because my meal was delicious.  My mom had the butternut squash ravioli, which was also delicious and well liked by two very strong critics.  Once we got into the parking lot, it took us 15 minutes to find parking, which was kind of annoying but could be due to the fact that it's a Friday and the holiday season. Wait staff was decent."}
{"text":"Location: great location, at Yorkdale mall with lots of outdoor parking. However no entrance from inside the mall.   Atmosphere: always clean however a bit dark.   Staff: Host is usually friendly and serves you right away.  Waitstaff is not overly friendly, you sometimes get one that is, but on average you get your typical waiter/waitress  That is taking your order. No extra smiles just the regular.  They tend to be busy so it's sometimes hard to her there attention.   Food: great food. However a bit pricey.  The California salad, that is one of my favourites, is not a a large enough portion to be charging a lot for. It is not a meal.   Portions in general seem to be on the smaller end for entrees.   This place is great for a ladies night out, as they have Bellinis and appetizers for those catch up times. Also great for the gentlemen that want to have some drinks near the bar section and watch a bit of sports.   Will be back, based primarily on location  and now the offer Scene points to!"}
{"text":"Worst burger I've had in a loooong time. Really disappointed. The patty was dry and not hot. Seemed like it wasn't made from fresh meat. The bun was also dry, a little hard, and burnt. You know when bread sits out for too long? It gets a hard? That's what this was like.   Only went here out of necessity. Had an event at the congress centre. Will go out of my way to not come back. McDonalds even looks good compared to this."}
{"text":"Really great customer service. Food was delicious. The steak was so tender and smooth to cut. Missing a bit of sauce though.  There was a special menu for the cantina- took the chilli lime chorizo- chicken was so tender really good taste for the seasoning. The rice was blend no taste at all. Not spicy"}
{"text":"I generally avoid franchised restaurants in favor of new interesting restaurants but location and ease wins out sometimes. This Milestones is located not far from STC and the subway, so if you are looking for non-food court grub this is a convenient option.   My experience at this chain restaurant was very pleasant. Our server was accommodating and kind, seating us by the washrooms (pregnant friend's request) and making sure we had plenty of hot water (my request). I had the Cantina Fish Tacos Duo with a side ceaser salad. The two tacos were a good size and fully stuffed, eating it was a little messy but worth it. The Roasted Garlic Caesar Salad made a good side over fries. We lingered afterwards to chat and our server never rushed us to leave, only bringing us more water when we were running low.  A substantial meal in a warm friendly relaxed space!"}
{"text":"We came in a group of nine people on a Friday afternoon. We made reservations beforehand, so we were promptly seated and the service throughout was friendly and efficient. The meal started out with the sweet potato fries and the Mediterranean goat cheese platter ($12.75) to share as appetizers. The sweet potato fries came with three different dips but the better appetizer would go to the goat cheese platter. It comes with a slab of goat cheese topped with red pepper relish, 4 long slices of toasted focaccia bread, sweet fig jam and soft roasted garlic. A great way to start the meal.  I wasn't terribly hungry, so I ordered the Roasted Mushroom Soup ($7.75) as a light lunch. It was a sizable portion of soup, with a couple croutons and basil infused oil floating on top. The soup itself was good, well seasoned and plenty of mushrooms in the soup. A sprinkle to freshly cracked pepper made it perfect.   This Milestones is on the very top floor of the 10 Dundas East, so getting here takes the determination to take the seemingly endless escalators up floor by floor. Once there, it is a nice space, tastefully decorated and well laid out to accommodate different group sizes. Quiet enough to chat, even during the lunch hour. There is also a nice patio area that would make a great place to have a drink in the summer months, especially when there is something going on at Dundas square."}
{"text":"The food was great.  I always love the food at Milestones. But for a quiet mid afternoon it took forever to get our meals. Then it took forever to get the bill. We were trying to get a quick on the run meal. After 15 minutes of waiting with the bill to pay for it, I had to stand up and go to the back to find someone. The servers were chit chatting in the kitchen. So frustrating."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I left feeling frustrated. The place has a ton of potential, but is just poorly executed.   The decor, ambience and setting is very nice.  Parking is much better than many other restaurants in the area.  Waited 40 minutes for a table. Saw many empty tables while we waited.  The waitress said all the right things, then failed to deliver. Service was very slow. We had a table of 6 and food came out one person at a time. The first person was almost done their fries before the last person got thier steak.  A different person brought food to our table each time. Every time we requested a refill or vinegar, it was slow or forgotten. When the waitress got the order wrong, she barley apologized! The food varied from boring to very nice.  At the end of the end of he night I left feeling very frustrated and do not plan to return.   Veggy burger - boring. 0 creativity.  Regular burger - average.  Goat cheese starter - didn't have enough pity for all the spearheads. Garlic was burnt.  Fillet steak was very good, but fries arrived cold.  Pasta dish was average.  Martinis were great."}
{"text":"This is a convenient location, the Food is good and, unlike other reviewers, I have always had a good experience. I have tried a bunch of dishes.....all as expected....Lamb kebobs, Chicken dishes..etc.. They have a butternut squash ravioli that appeals to the vegetarians in my circle. I like the fact they have a few choices for vegetarians. I have been here on business lunches and casual dinners. It is comfortable and convenient."}
{"text":"This location is okay; nothing special, but not bad. The food can be hit and miss, but my two solid favorites are the grilled chicken salad and the spinach and artichoke dip. Occasionally they don't put enough dressing on the salad, which ruins it, but when they put enough dressing, it is delicious. I love the honey lime vinaigrette and the peanut sauce, and the grilled chicken and crunchy chips balance each other out. I quite often have salad cravings and come here just for that! The spinach and artichoke dip is another solid choice, and they will refill your chips if you ask. The fries and the Caesar salad are also quite good. The restaurant isn't anything fancy, but good, solid food if you're looking for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Noticed there were many servers but none of them were helpful enough to really approach if you need anything. Forgetful I must say, we asked for water 3x. Our server seemed disconnected as well, she talks to us without even looking at us which is quite irritating.  Food is good thank God."}
{"text":"Up here on business from the States. I walked over from my hotel so very convenient. I had the pineapple ginger salmon which was fine. It was nicely done and the shrimp rice was quite good.  Decent beer selection. The service may have been a little slow but I wasn't in a hurry so no big deal. I sat in bar area and it was comfortable."}
{"text":"We arrived for brunch at 10:40am and was promptly seated. There were next to no people in the restaurant so it was nice. We were given not only a brunch menu but also the lunch and I believe a dinner menu as well as an anniversary menu which was ending today. It was nice that we could order off of any of these menus. However we were not allowed to order mimosa's until 11:00am which made sense, but just be aware as the restaurant opens at 10am on Sunday's.   I ordered the spinach and feta omelette without toast and my other friends ordered a hamburger, one of their salads and eggs Benedict. Mine came with the toast even though I asked for it without but everyone enjoyed their meal very much. The service was a little slow but our waitress was easy to hail down and am sure that with it being so slow she became pre occupied with busying herself to look busy.   I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"@MilestonesCa #YELPGTA #MISSISSAUGAHEARTLAND #MILESTONES  The manager at this restaurant eyed my Yelp review and wanted me to come back for another experience here. He's been placed at the restaurant recently and he comes from the Queensway location (my favourite). So, I have high hopes for this location now!  I really hope the new management turns the place around, and starts standing for what Milestones offers. I ordered the Baked Goat Cheese & Roasted Garlic for appetizer and a Steak for my entree. Both were presented a lot better than they were last time. Tasted okay as well. Service was immaculate as well. Left satisfied.  The interiors still need a major upgrade."}
{"text":"The parking here is a pain in the ass - be prepared to wait or drive around for atleast 20 minutes on a Friday or Saturday. However, I am glad I waited it out for our weekend date night. The food was as good as I had remembered it to be.   Our Order:   Baked Goat Cheese & Roasted Garlic: This is a must try for all those goat cheese fans out there. Although smaller in quantity than I expected, the warm melted goat cheese tastes absolutely exquisite with the herbed stone-baked flat bread. This dish is served with a cranberry puree and fig jam. My first time doing fig jam and I absolutely loved it.   Top Sirloin: His order, I wasn't allowed to try. But the man was satisfied!   Old Fashioned Burger: This wasn't as tender or juicy as I remembered. But it was big and good. I don't think I am going to come back for a $15 burger though.  Rail drinks are $4 or Fridays and Saturdays. What a deal! We decided to go for the special. He ordered a whiskey lime; and I did a tequila lime, in a glass rimmed with salt. When they brought in our drinks, I was slightly disappointed at the amount. But unlike a lot of rail drinks, these were strong. So, understood and forgiven!   I'd really like to come back to Milestones for appetizers - I saw some more on the menu that I'd love to try. Plus, when your options are Montanas, Jack Astors and Moxies, Milestones wins hands down."}
{"text":"@MilestonesCa #NIGHTOUT #MILESTONES #YELPTO #RESTAURANT  Sorry, Milestones! Slamming you yet again.  We went to Milestones after a movie night (convenient location), for some appetizers and drinks. We ended up ordering 3 appetizers, as detailed below, and sangria. Can't say anything was eventful. To top the eventful date night, the server was inattentive - she took forever to bring out plain simple water. I had to ask twice. And she never really brought us refills.   About our order:  1. Mediterranean Goat Cheese Platter - Milestones used to have a generous portion of baked goat cheese served with cranberry, herbed flatbread and fig jam, which was basically my favorite Milestones item. They basically changed this dish - sans cranberry and herbed flatbread now and half the portion; served with some red pepper relish and plain bread.   2. Coconut Calamari - Love calamari. Not sure this fusion calamari is to everyone's taste. I think they took an experiment too far. It's a small serving and although it sounds fancy, it's not gourmet by any means.   3. Asian Chicken Bites - What about fresh cucumbers and sweet chili sauce screams spicy? Well, it was spicy... and not that great. You get a whole lot of twisty wontons for the little amount of chicken they serve.   4. Superfruit Red Sangria Pitcher - We had some lime and apple floating in ours, that's it. So much for seasonal fruit. Not worth the money, skip and order the cheapest cocktail instead."}
{"text":"#MILESTONES #YELP #FOOD #COCKTAILS  I really enjoy this particular Milestones location. It's right around my favorite area, close to the alma mater Ryerson, Dundas Square and Eaton Centre. And it's MILES better than the Jack Astors in the building. But, it's always fairly busy.   We were a group of 6. Service was a little bit of a bust, slower than usual on a Tuesday night. However, our server had a sense of humor and you could tell she was a people person. Had us charmed, and hence this is not the 3 star review it could've been.   I ordered the following:   2 Margaritas - the first one was better than the second somehow. I am guessing a bartendar swap.   Bellini - WORST ever. Way too sweet.   Rare Prime Rib Steak - Perfectly prepared with the right amount of fat marbling. The sides weren't as good. Too much potato... and no greens in the veggie side. And a mustard dressing that didn't taste too good.  So, I had a reasonably good time. I enjoy Milestones, particularly because they have some great daily specials. I'll be back.   PS: the light fixture next to ours was leaking. And the table freaked out. Oh well, atleast it wasn't ours!"}
{"text":"Wonderful location. Very friendly service. I ordered the bruschetta and spaghetti. Both were delicious. And to top that with the torte. Overall a great place to hang out. And the prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Extremely unsatisfied with my meal here.  I came here with a group for dinner, and my friend and I ordered the \"date night combo\" for $50, with 2 entrees, 1 appy and a shared dessert. We both ordered rare steaks, and they were obviously medium at best.  The waitress, bringing them over, said that they were medium. Upon inspection, they looked medium; brown on the outside, with a slight tinge of pink on the inside. I mentioned that I ordered a rare steak, and she agreed that this was cooked medium.  The waiter who took my order initially came over and said that he had taken the steaks down as rare, and the the waitress must have misheard the kitchen. He agreed to take the steaks back even though he said that they were rare.  The kicker though, is that he came back in 5 minutes WITH THE SAME STEAKS. Either they overcooked 2 steaks in 5 minutes or didn't bother actually changing them. While I would have normally sent it back, everyone else in my group had already received their food and started eating, and I was in no mood to wait any longer.  In terms of the food, the fries were decent, but the whole ordeal with the steaks honestly kind of ruined my meal. The gall of the waiter to try and pass off obviously medium to medium well steaks off as rare, and then try and say that they were done differently was more than a bit ridiculous.  This will not happen again, as I will NOT be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Credit is given when credit is due.  This Milestones does a good job to ensure a smooth, easy and enjoyable dining experience.  The menu, of course, is identical to the menu of all other Milestones locations in GTA, which consists of a main staple/main stream section and a seasonal section.  The food tastes good.  The prime rib I had this Saturday evening ($24 for small) was favourful and tender,  The grilled shrimps of my BF's salad were overly salty, however.  Our waiter was wonderful.  He was cheerful, polite, effective.  He kept us posted on when the drinks and food were coming.  Special note was that he went through with us the drink promotion of the day, which was all basic bar rail drinks.  I needed to throw 3 cocktail examples, thus looked stupid and obviously oblivious what \"basic\" bar rail was in the process, before I nailed down to whiskey on the rock.  He didn't in any way make me feel uncomfortable, for which I was grateful."}
{"text":"The services was friendly and professional during a business lunch last Thursday.  The waitress was savvy in having small talks with the VIPs on our table, which I greatly appreciated.  All the servers were eager to impress.  I feel comfortable taking future business clients to this particular location of Milestones due to this experience."}
{"text":"I been to this Milestone before on several occasion and I have always liked the AMC location over this one, until today.   Came here on a  Monday to celebrate my belated birthday and had the Monday Girls Nite Out Special (4 Bellinis and 4 Apps for $40). At first all my girlfriends were quite concern about portion size and after 8 bellinis and 8 apps later we came out pretty stuffed. What made this visit special was our waiter. We had a party member who did not drink alochol and he offered to give her lemonade with no charge and allowed us to change the tortilla chips to naan (which they made a mistake, but he gave us both anyways). Of course the taste of the food is quite mediocre, but seriously the bill came out to be $100 bucks with tips and left over for 8 alcoholic drinks and 8 apps.   The great service and that extra mile our waiter took to serve us made me reconsider that perhaps the North York Centre is better than the AMC location."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and was happy with the food and service but I'm basing my 5 star review on my most recent visit. I came here on a Sunday night with my family for an early dinner. Our server was engaging and friendly right off the bat. We were greeted shortly after being seated, with waters. He had brought a mixture of hot and cold, which was a nice touch since my mom prefers hot water. Shortly after placing our orders, our meals were all served at once. My sister in law ordered the cod but noticed it was still a bit raw, so asked to have it sent back to the kitchen. She received a free salad for the inconvenience and wait, given the rest of the table already had their meals. When the server returned with her dish, he let us know that it'd be comped. We were really impressed with this service, and didn't expect that they would take such steps to make sure we left happy. This location is the nicest Milestones I've been in the GTA, too - spacious, clean, and with modern decor. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My coworkers had organized a going away lunch here. I didn't think I would enjoy my meal or my time here but I was pleasantly surprised.   We were part of a large group so they had seated us in a nice, secluded section from the rest of the restaurant. The waitress we had was quick, really attentive with our orders and was prompt. Usually, with a large group they are quite slow, but surprisingly they were on top of things.   I had ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich. Although my meal was dry and plain, I know others who had thoroughly enjoyed their meal and for that reason I am giving them a 4 out of 5. Do order the sweet potato fries if you can because they were crisp, and not drenched in oil.   There food is a little pricy for lunch, but for the service you get, I can say it's worth it. I would definitely recommend this place again for a large group setting."}
{"text":"The service at this place was brutal. It took 30 mins to get a drink.  Our meals were average bar quality  food.  I would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This was not the 1st time my date and I have been here. The Women's washroom could have used a good clean. My date didn't even go because it was a mess! This was our 2nd time coming here! ALSO THE LAST! Our waitress has a grand total of 4 tables I was never asked for a refill on my Pop? But let's face the fact the $2 that was charged for the side of bread was this either really slow waitress tip or this newbie waitress tip! Also not sure why she is waiting over me as I use the debit machine?"}
{"text":"Milestone's was, I'm pretty sure, the last of the big Canadian restaurant chains I hadn't tried, so I was pretty excited to give the place a shot during a work event last week.  The menu is chock full of all the usual staples of a middle-of-the-road chain restaurant, but during our visit, they were doing a Cantina event (which meant that there was a separate menu with interesting-sounding Tex-Mex dishes).  I decided to go with the Grande Taco Salad (\"a massive crisp fried jalape√±o cilantro tortilla with your favourite Mexican flavours: braised seasoned beef, black beans, pico de gallo, avocado, cheddar cheese, crisp salad greens, crispy tortilla strips and a spiced cilantro crema with fresh cilantro and lime.\")  It eventually arrived to the table and was just about the size of my head. It's a surprisingly tasty dish. It is, as advertised, a salad, so the majority of the bowl consists of the aforementioned \"crisp salad greens,\" but fortunately there's a generous helping of the various other elements. It certainly felt like I was eating a taco in bowl form. I do have to admit, however, that the taco shell was disappointing. It was extremely greasy and the flavor was a little weird.  I did enjoy my meal, but the prices at Milestone's uniformly seem a little high, so it's hard to imagine ever returning (especially given the preponderance of smaller, independent restaurants in the area)."}
{"text":"Went here the other night, order the sirloin with the peppercorn sauce. I would not suggest going here for a steak at all. The cut of meat was terrible. My steak was under cooked so it had to be put back on the grill. The peppercorn sauce is very overwhelming and thicker than I had anticipated. The \"seasonal veggies\" was a mash up of aldente peppers, Brussels, onions and tomatoes that were bland. Not really what I expected as \"seasonal veggies\" my own fault for not asking.   I also got the garlic mashed which were ok but they leave the skins from the potatoes on which I personally don't enjoy.   My daughter ordered salmon and garlic mashed from the kids menu and really enjoyed her salmon but didn't eat her mashed because of the skins.   Our server was named John I believe, he was attentive, polite and very friendly."}
{"text":"This place has the worst tuna tacos I have ever had. Supposed to come on a bed of cilantro line cole slaw. Was actually served on a dry bed of shredded lettuce. After I challenged the server she sent the tacos back for me. And they came out exactly the same but with a salad dressing added. I not time. Considering the other spots around I will just skip this all together in the future. Thank god I got a gift card to cover this trip. Joeys across the street is much better and takes much more pride in te food served."}
{"text":"Good food, consistent service, and nice ambiance make this restaurant a good choice when you just want some good Canadian food."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on a Sunday. They serve breakfast items until 4pm on weekends!   I had the French toast with nutella drizzle. The bananas are carmelized and simmered in maple syrup. This resulted in an enormous puddle on my plate that I actually had to drain onto another plate. It was edible and very good (albeit sweet, duh), but it wasn't my favorite. I have had much better without the mess.   Service was fantastic!   Alas, this place is what it is. It's nothing special but it does the trick."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Went there for dinner... nice ambiance, good service, good selections in the menu.  We had Steak Frites, medium-rare. It was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy. A bit mild for taste buds, but has rich flavour. Also had Cakes by the Ocean (crisp quinoa-crusted shrimp ans salmon cakes). It was delicious!! The presentation of the foods were superb and appetizing."}
{"text":"I have visited this place and it was pretty good. Waiters are very nice and do know menu card. I wasn't really sure what I wanted to get and I asked our waiter. He explained me each option. I really enjoyed atmosphere there and tables for 6+ people are comfortable. Really clean place but that have to change their washroom signs because I was confused and went to women washroom. Other than that no complains. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went for a business dinner and ordered the Steak & Frites for 30$ and 2.99$ for unlimited soda. It was an amazing steak, and very delicious. The restaurant was a little dark in my corner were my table was, and the music was loud, but service was great, and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was meh, fries were too salty, service was meh.   We had a really awkward server who kept ignoring us for some reason No lineups even for a Friday night  Really small menu"}
{"text":"Decor: excellent - eaisly one of the nicest looking restaraunts in the city.  Food: mediocre.  This chain tries too hard to be a 'fancy' resatraunt with pricing similar to earls (for example).  In the end, it doesn't do fancy well, and the limited menu leaves variety to find something 'mormal'.  Examples: Ceasar salad with no dressing and one giant crouton on the side isn't fancy.  Or a slasa that isonly chopped tomatoes.  And it took a loooong time to get our food after ordering.  We'll pass in the future."}
{"text":"I visit this location twice (2) a year for the last 3 years. From the food to the staff this place is TOP NOTCH. The bread with melted cheese and chimichurri is great!  Note: the guys working the bar are phenomenal. Most important, the same staff is always working there (no turnovers)."}
{"text":"Everytime I walk into Milestones, I'm greeted by the smell of wet towel! I don't get it. Maybe it's just the seating area on the bar-half of the restaurant. Seriously though... it's getting old. Luckily, my drink and food usually cancel it out in time.  Aside from that, I really like the food at Milestone's. I recommend the Certified Angus Beef 8oz. Top Sirloin. It comes with a trio of their signature steak sauces: house-made worcestershire, kobe mustard, & gaucho sauce. All three are tasty, but I prefer the good 'ole worcestershire -- the kobe mustard comes in at a very close 2nd.   The portabello mushroom chicken is also a very good entree.  I've had decent service here while seating in the bar area. My party was checked on at steady intervals. Maybe it had something to do w/ the bartender & our server attending to us. Our drinks were getting refilled on the regular. Beer, martinis, wine... it's all good.  All-in-all, it's a good restaurant. Chain restaurants are supposed to be, right?!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out only to receive missing items. Gave them a call and they said their manager would call us back and would compensate us but never received no call back. Not one to call twice so I figured a yelp review of the poor service would be better. I hope they work on better services for their customers in the future and ensure that all items ordered are in the customers take out bags. Given that Milestones items are not McDonald's price, one can understand why we felt ripped off."}
{"text":"The biggest draw for me to Milestone's is its reliability and consistency. I've yet to have an unpleasant experience at this location, which has a gorgeous interior and great outdoor patio (note: outdoor seating arrangements are limited to groups of 4).  The girl and I almost always order Spinach & Artichoke Dip. This item has been on Milestone's' menu for years, and with good reason.   Beer: Milestone's used to promote their own Palomino beer, but they have phased it out and now offer the usual suspects on tap: Guinness, Keith's, Creemore. Bellinis are always popular with the ladies.  I never stray too far from the Grilled Mediterranean Chicken for a main. It's not too adventurous, but the combination of goat cheese and pomegranate molasses is hard to ignore.  Milestone's is a bit steep for the food, but the location and consistency keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The Ultimate Bellinis on tuesday is amazing! But nonetheless the service here is ok!. We had made a reservation for 20 people 2 weeks ago and yet when we reached there on time, they took another half an hour to get us seated. It was really embarrasing and I would not recommend this place for large groups. The food and drinks were scrumptious yet the service is an important part of the experience."}
{"text":"Our second \"date night\" at this location. I am not so pleased this time. We ordered the 8oz. sirloin steak which was part of the date night menu. The meat was tough with a  few chewy connective tissues that one can choke on. Our food came a bit cold as I saw it standing on top of the counter waiting to be served. It was quite busy that time so I would be considerate to give this place another chance under these circumstances. They have gluten-free options,substitutions with a few dollars extra. We enjoyed the dessert though, chocolate gnash torte.. Melts in the mouth yumminess. Until the next date night:))"}
{"text":"Went here for a business lunch. Called head for a reservation as its close to Christmas. Great service both from seating us and the food service. Great soup, burger and pasta bowl was had and all were great tasting and hot."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the raptors play. Good that they put the sound of the game on. Got the prime rib sandwich $19. There were some chewy parts to the prime rib where there was fat. The prime rib was literally a prime rib stuffed in a sandwich. Not thin sliced prime rib meat but an actual slab of prime rib. The sandwich was really good and went well with yam fries."}
{"text":"Newly opened located beside the VIP cinema. I don't think there is an entrance through the theatre but if you came through the underground parking then you just have to take the exit close to Chatime.   Peach bellini $4.50 - this is a promo price and its normally priced at $7.50 - Not too sure how long this price will last. Tasted so good we got another and the 2nd one we got was piled so high it looked like it was shaved ice from Cha Me Cha...lol  Burger $15 + $1 for yam fries - Nothing really special to point out here. The yam fries were cut really thin and small and comes with dipping sauce.   10oz prime rib $28 - the meat soft and tender and tasted good. Even though the size of the meat is based on weight I didn't like how thin the prime rib was cut. Most important part though is that it tasted good.   Prime rib sandwich $18 + $1 for yam fries - The meat was good especially when you dip it into the aju they provide. The container the aju came in was really small so you couldn't really dip the sandwich into it but instead I had to pour it into the sandwich. This made for a messy meal. After sampling parts of the burger and some of the 10oz prime rib and finishing my own prime rib sandwich I have to say I was not really full. It could be just me since I do consider myself a big eater but I felt the food was not really filling. If you had appetizer and dessert then I'm pretty sure you will leave full but that would cost you.   Service was excellent.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my friends. when we arrived around 11am, it wasn't very busy. we were seated right away. Everything was going well. However, the server took forever to follow up with us to see if we were ready to order. A couple ladies nearby were also waiting a long time. When i got up at one point, they even thought i was their server, since it had been so long. They eventually got up to find her. Once we ordered, our drinks and food came in a timely manner. The food was alright, and we all ordered the same drink (silver jubellini), which was pretty tasty. I was about 2/3 done when i noticed there was a shard of something in my mouth. At first i thought it was a small piece of ice, but it wasn't cold or melting in my mouth. I took it out and realized it was a piece of glass! We notified our server, who then informed her manager. One of the managers came out to apologize...and that was all they did. I could have easily swallowed the glass or cut my mouth, and I get a lousy apology. They didn't even offer me a replacement drink, in fact they took away what remained (not that I wanted it, in case there was any more glass in it).  Bottom line: service is slow and terrible. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I've gone to Milestone's for years, but this was my first time at the Heartland location. Service was unbelievably slow. It took us half an hour to order and the restaurant barely had three full tables in the dining room.   Personally disappointed that they changed the recipe of the butternut squash ravioli; it used to be my favourite dish there. They also made the portions smaller, leaving me wanting more."}
{"text":"Since plans didn't work out for me at the theatre that night had to figure out a plan B so the night wasn't totally wasted. So plan B was MILESTONES!  Not the greatest alternative plan but got to try a new place which I wasn't planning on to! The milestones at the downtown markham is fairly large and has very nice decor. It almost looks much better and higher class than the other Milestones.   Our server had mentioned the difference from this location from others, which were that all food items were freshly made to order.. So does that mean that the other locations have leftovers ready made to order? Just having tried a bunch of appetizers, everything tasted pretty good! Good portion size for all the appetizers.   So far good overall experience but the customer service was lacking.. Our server seldomly came to check up on us and when trying to flag him down he always appeared to be nowhere to been seen. I don't really see much difference between this new location when compared to the other Milestones, but now I do question whether their food is prepared 'FRESH' since this location at the theatres is supposedly 'different' from others... Really makes me wonder......."}
{"text":"The service was incredibly slow. 15 mins to get your drinks after you ordered them? Staff came back twice after taking our order advising us that some of the food we ordered was no longer available. This restaurant was considerably less busy than all the other ones on the street. Don't let that be your choice for coming here. We were quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today with a coworker. We had the seared tuna tacos as an appetizer, it was good. The squash ravioli were a dissapointment. Ive never had them with marinara sauce like I had them here. And it really takes away from the flavor of the ravioli itself. My coworker had the salmon salad, that was really good. However the salmon was quite undercooked, which we dont mind but i know other people do. Service was slow, they were busy filming some sort of training video. Also, one of the waitresses had an extremely short skirt, not appropriate at all! Would not return."}
{"text":"Living in Seattle for a long time can definitely help you put into perspective what a \"good\" \"American Grill & Bar\" is, even if it only exists in Canada (hehehehe the awkwardness of that category is amusing).  This place is in the newly-opened Cineplex Odeon Markham VIP theatre complex. This place gets a decent 4/5 (I'll explain why afterwards) in my book; fairly good, will come again!  Pros: - GREAT selection of beer, wine, and champagne. I'm fairly sure they had harder liquors as well, but I've only had their beers -- I was surprised they had Steam Whistle & Mill St -- it's not often you get the local beers at your local watering hole!. - Amazing atmosphere - there are massive TVs all around the venue (including one directly behind my head where I was sitting), displaying different shows / games / events. - Lots of bar seating, as well as group tables and high/low tables (you can be seated pretty much anywhere). - Newly built - this place feels like a great restaurant / bar space, since it was purposefully planned with a floor plan in mind. - Presentation of food (and beer) is impeccable - I felt like I was being served quality food dishes, because of just how appetizing it looked. See pictures for details. - Great location - this place is literally inside of a movie theatre complex (where we went after being thoroughly disappointed that the Star Wars showing was cancelled, and we weren't informed until *after* I'd bought my popcorn and drink. Standby for that review!). - Dinner menu is pretty large - it makes it incredibly hard to pick *exactly one dish* you want to eat. Having a massive selection is great, but it also can lead to the associated con.  Cons: - Not a very large dessert menu. It wasn't \"tiny\", but I figured there'd be more than four options -- and not having the prices in front of you can really cast doubt into whether or not any of the options are better than the others. As I've said be fore, having the numbers is entirely personal preference - I like having all of the information in front of me when making any decision. - Food portions are actually a little small for the cost. I'm not necessarily complaining - this is an observation I've made based on paying $85 for two beers, a 10oz Prime Rib dinner and a chicken pasta dish, as well as a shared dessert. Not terrible I guess, but it's not something I could list as a \"pro\", nor is it something that I would want to spend *that much money on* again anytime soon. - Dinner menu is pretty large - you can tell this place does not have a \"specialty\" that it excels at. - Service isn't super quick - took a while to get my refill on a drink, but the waiter improved and was serving drinks well in advance of needing them later on. The food took a little while longer to come out than expected as well, which was a bit of a bummer as I was *starving*.  The main reason I'm giving this place a 4/5 is because of the lack of specialty. I think this place has awesome potential for me to edit it to become a 5/5 one day, if and when the Milestone's brand introduces \"specialty dishes\" that they focus their menus around, and actually create dishes like Prime Rib *well* (it was decent, but I've had better at competitor places, as well as my own cooking, which is awkward because I expected this restaurants' \"grill\" to be better than my backyard cooking); it may take a while though, because given how dry that Prime Rib was, I'm a little hesitant to not just give a 3/5 instead of a 4/5.  Regardless, I would still recommend this place to anyone who has some time to kill before their movie starts! Great location, with decent service and the familiar Milestone's menu."}
{"text":"Not all Milestones are equal.  This one was the not so nice of the family.   Came in here on a week night for some pasta and a mojito a few months ago. All I can remember is the service was so very very slow, the mojjito was mostly ice and sugar and watered down, and the pasta tasted funny. Now I hate writing bad reviews when I know a restaurant can do better but they haven't proved otherwise yet. They're so inconsistent that I haven't had any desire to return and I used to really like this restaurant. Their menu is great though but I recommend going to another location."}
{"text":"Customer service in Calgary is incredibly sh***y...and that's me being nice...so when I met up with a friend for supper on a business trip I wasn't expecting much..especially from a Milestones...but much to my complete shock and amazement we received some of the best service I have EVER had!!  The Hostess said that the restaurant was full but we could wait in the lounge..she walked us in and told us the best seat to grab and then waved a server over. The server told us some drink specials...made some of her fave suggestions and took the order...the lounge was super busy and they were a bit under staffed so it took some time for the drink to come. She was very apologetic and when our table was ready she waved the charge on the drinks....????...that's right...they gave them to us because we had to wait...we didn't even complain...it was brilliant!  The server who helped while dinning was equally fantastic..if not a little over friendly...and had our order to us promptly..I had the mushroom chicken and garlic mashed potatoes and she had a 3 cheese burger and fries...both delicious!  As we were leaving a bus boy asked us how are evening was and hoped we enjoyed the meal...a bus boy?? Where the hell am I...what do they want from me....I was starting to get paranoid as to why all the staff seemed so nice...were we on some new reality show??  We went to the hostess to pay and the manager was standing at the door...he too asked how the meal was...now it was getting ridiculous...I told him how amazing everyone was and he should be proud of his staff and that I was actually getting suspicious of the good service...he laughed and said not to worry..it was their pleasure..I seriously had to get my friend to hold me up so I didn't pass out...."}
{"text":"poor! Poor! Poor! Waited over an hour for our meal. (We were a table of 3) asked for medium steak and it was well done! Wasn't gonna wait another hour for steak. Cheese on ur pasta??? Asked half way thru finishing. Ordered a beer and water, sever never came back to ask if we wanted refills. Nothing was discounted. Was given the excuse \"we have a lot of parties\" yet the place was half empty!"}
{"text":"Part of this new chain of pre-movie noms, Milestones is located on the most left hand side of this new huge Uptown Markham Cineplex VIP complex.    When we went in, service was very friendly and our waitress was very nice throughout the whole meal.  Food was Milestones quality - so it wasn't any worse than any other Milestones but at the end of the day, Milestones is not \"mind-blowing\" food.    We had the penne chicken asiago and the steak frites and I must say the pasta was way better.  The penne chicken asiago came in a HUGE plate and it was actually quite good.  It was one of those comfort dishes that can last you about 2 meals.  We ended up packing the rest home.  The steak frites was subpar.  The steak itself lacked any sort of flavour, was a little too well done (despite saying medium) and the frites were not crispy enough.  They also didn't have great dipping sauces (run of the mill mayo and ketchup).    We also were treated to a bellini sample and it is the same awesome girls night out juicy drink I've always had.  Maybe my tastebuds have changed since the good old days of being a student back in Guelph or maybe Milestones has gotten to be a bigger chain; but for some reason, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did back in my school days.  Am I becoming a food snob or has the food become subpar?  I guess I'll leave it up to you foodies to let me know!"}
{"text":"menu is changing which meant .... no service?   we placed an order.... that item has been taken off the menu, after which we were told the menu change was happening next week, so we ordered a salad to share. a different salad arrived because again the menu is changing but no one told us the salad we ordered would be different... missing items, new items, different dressing, etc... So we order a third time, a manager comes out and apologizes.  i watch as other tables around us are having the same issues, and much food is being sent back.  bill comes..... $2 off....  after \"lunch\" took 2 hours...  thanks but no thanks. but hey guys the menu is changing so .... try again next week maybe?"}
{"text":"Nice proximity to the  AMC theater. Patio is a treat when the weather cooperates. They have heaters outside but not sure when/if they fire' em up. Nice place to enjoy a glass of wine before you move on to other things.  Nice selection of easy choices including a dinner for 2 movie deal. Not gonna blow your dress over your head, but nice and easy when venturing into the den of retail inequity."}
{"text":"Went there last night after work (super tired) with my parents. My lamb was spicy. I politely asked the server to bring me the menu and I once again looked for a reference for it being spicy on the description. It didn't mention it being spicy. I told my server that the description of the plate didn't mention at all it being spicy and gave it back. My mom and dad's pasta, which came as a side for their portobello chicken and chicken parmesan, were literally  flavourless (we were wondering if they had forgotten the butter or something).They didn't have mashed potatoes as a side or baked potatoes. The food wasn't good. The manager came after to apologize about the lamb but an apology won't bring back my time."}
{"text":"What's good: Mojitos on patio; weekday drink specials  What's not: Gluten-free bread on their burger. The gluten-free bread breaks apart immediately after one bite into it. It was sad. So sad.  Service: Prompt, friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I may be inflating this grade because a couple weeks ago we went to the pickle barrel & I got food poisoning.   That's then & now I got a nice Caesar and some chicken & waffles. Which were both delightful. The Caesar was a little mild but I got into the horseradish eventually.   The main dish was delicious. So good. Chicken and waffles topped with a poached egg (mom?) and candied bacon and gravy. Yummm."}
{"text":"Came here before going to a concert at Massey Hall on a Friday night. This place is packed! You have either the out of towners who are still in awe of the big city or locals who are grabbing a drink/eating a meal after work.   After a long, busy week, I rewarded myself with the famous Milestone Bellini. It was a little too sweet for my liking, but I def wouldn't discourage you from ordering it.   Both the companion and I ordered salads with the Kobe sliders and the spinach dip. Good choices. The salads were 'whatever', but I enjoyed the Kobe sliders. With one order, you get three little burgers with a mustard spread on the side. The spinach dip was pretty good too. It wasn't too salty and there was a little spicy kick to it.   If you find yourself going to the Canon Theater or Massey Hall and you need to grab a bite, consider Milestone's."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Milestones.  The Newmarket location is a great example of things done well.  The menu is a good mixture of choices, and the food looks as good on your plate as it does in the pictures.  I've often had the steaks here and been very happy with them, but today I had the Mediterranean chicken server with chickpeas, goat cheese, and greens.  It is drizzled with a slightly sweet balsamic sauce.  Mouth watering.  The restaurant is very clean, the staff very inviting, and the decor is very nice as well.  Really a great experience start to finish"}
{"text":"Friendly waitress and services but the entire restaurant service experience was quite slow. Lucky me and my gf didn't buy tickets to watch movies or else we have to skip our meal or skip the movie. If you plan to eat before you watch a movie, I suggest you go somewhere like the next door burger place so you won't miss your movie.  The food was alright. The burgers tasted like burgers but compared to other places around the nearby area the price cost more. I guess the extra cost was the seating and the wait time for our food. We had the peanut butter cheese cake for dessert, and i don't think we will want to have another piece EVER again. We like the regular cheese cake :)"}
{"text":"I kind of waffle between 2 and 3 stars.  It's very comparable to Moxie's and has similar style food.  There's also a gluten-free menu.  Why only 2 stars?  Well I ordered the kobe style meatloaf and it was very average.  It was also only lukewarm.  I added lots of salt.  Not much more to say."}
{"text":"30 for 30:  Outrageous prices for what it is. I've never understood the prices here and now that everything in Toronto is more expensive, it's even more outrageous!! I actually asked them for a lunch menu and they told me, \"that IS our lunch menu.\" Ok so the prices are just ridiculous.   The seafood pasta my mom and I shared was ok.  The spinach-artichoke dip we all shared as an appetizer was fine.  The kid's meal here is HUGE!! The chicken fingers had 3 chicken fingers which is reasonable but then there was 10x more fries!! It was an adult-sized plate of fries. My cousin said that's how they get away with charging $8.  Finally, let's talk about that kid's apple juice. For starters, it was odd it was served in such a heavy glass.  Not very kid-friendly. Also there was something dirty in the juice!! My cousin sent it back and the waitress walked away, gave us a new one and made no apology. I thought that was kind of strange but then her boss came over and basically told us there was nothing bad in the juice, apologized and left. I honestly, was very surprised that they didn't make us an offer such as a comped kids meal etc. *shrugs shoulders*  Overall, I think this place tries to be a fancier, more upscale chain restaurant, but I don't think its as fancy as it likes to think it is. It's just your average chain restaurant and its time Milestones realized it too."}
{"text":"2.5/5 stars. I've been to Milestones a few times after my previous reviews and it was at least a 4/5 stars. But for some reason last week's dining experience just didn't go as what I usually expect it to be.  I took my sister out for her 20th Birthday last Thursday evening. We were seated right away but no one came to greet and take our order until about 10 minutes after. If my sister didn't ask the hostess where our server was I'm pretty sure we would've been sitting there for longer.  We both ordered the prime rib in medium-rare for our dinner. Approximately 5-10 minutes later our server returned and told us that the kitchen could not our prime rib cooked to medium rare and that they could do medium. We love our prime rib in medium rare so this was VERY disappointing. It's strange because we've ordered the exact same order from the same restaurant and medium rare was an option. Since we've been waiting for so long we decided to just settle with their medium prime rib.  Overall, it was a disappointing experience. We actually considered going over to The Keg for prime rib instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Milestone's for my 24th birthday and everything from start to finish was excellent!  We started off with an original bellini and a glass of wine which were both great. Afterwards, we decided to share a large caesar salad, Italian sausage ravioli, and a small medium-rare prime rib. Everything came out quickly and tasted amazing! The main course came out hot and tasted fresh. Oh man, the prime rib was delicious. It was so tender that it just melted in our mouths when we took a bite.  This is by far the best Milestone's experience I have ever came upon!"}
{"text":"Definitely would recommend the Brunch special that comes with an eggs benny or omelette, a fruit cup, and a mimosa.   However if it is extremely hot out, I would not recommend committing to the patio. Many people asked to move inside shortly after sitting down due to the hot sun."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Nice decor, great staff and excellent food and drink choices at reasonable prices.  Veggie burger was excellent."}
{"text":"Enjoyied the food very much and had fast and friendly staff that serve you. The setting is very modern and a perfect place to have a business lunch or to take a date too."}
{"text":"This is the worst Milestones I've ever visited. You would think this is some sort of tourist trap for people who don't go downtown often. The food was sad here and the service was slow even though the restaurant wasn't busy. I just can't comprehend why this one just falls behind the other Milestones I've enjoyed."}
{"text":"This Milestones location is probably one the better ones out there. The food typically tastes better and the service is usually more attentive. That being said, it is a Milestones after all and most of the food tastes like it was precooked and typical of a cookie cutter chain restaurant."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday...never, ever go on Saturday, because the place will be packed full of about 20 people waiting for a table. I don't know if this is the wait staff, or the reservations, or the bussing staff, but they need to hurry the eff up. We were right on time at 7pm, and had a reservation, and yet we STILL waited 45 goddamned minutes for a table. The people who didn't have a reservation were waiting for almost two hours. The woman doing the reservations was impolite and rude, and kept texting on her cell phone. There is also no actual space for the people waiting to...you know...wait. Not even a bench outside.  The server was (artificially) nice, but getting his attention was a nightmare. I got ONE pop refill the entire night. He seemed stressed out, and I could tell he definitely didn't want to be there. Neither did I.  The prices were absolutely outrageous. SIXTEEN DOLLARS for a basic burger that I could get at Kelseys for ten or twelve bucks. The burger I had was the only saving grace of the night. It was decent, but nothing fantastic. The portion size was decent. I think the kitchen staff were the only ones who were turned on that day.  The atmosphere felt cramped and loud. I could barely hear what my wife was saying, as they had packed every single table around us. The low lightning was not fitting for a grill environment, and the booth we sat in was very uncomfortable. For 70$, I could have done much better than this.  Definitely a below average experience. My wife insisted that we go back, and the place was once again packed (that night, it was Friday). I turned her right around, and we went somewhere else. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Despite it being a chain and I am a bit anti-chain I enjoyed it.  I went in for a dinner with about 8 friends and even though we were a large party our food still came out fairly quickly.    I had the steak with peppercorn sauce.  The steak was a nice quality and was cooked to perfection.  The drink menu looked great too, but I was a little hungover so I didn't partake.  Next time though..."}
{"text":"well, I guess I should've walk out when I walked in. because when you go to a grill & bar restaurant, you are expecting a full house. if not, then its a warning. (that the first sign) second, if there are many womens in the restaurant, its a sign that this place will not have any good steak. (no pun intended) anyway, I ordered medium rare grilled sirloin with mushroom & gorgonzola marsala. skip that dish, the meat is soo chewy and soo many muscle fiber (felt like eating a super cow meat)  the salad was good. (that's why many women went there) but i want my meat. and they buy bad meat. so when they cook it, the meat turn out to be very tough to eat."}
{"text":"First off, I hate complaining about my meals or service. Waiter made a mistake and gave Asian chicken bites instead of the chicken wings. The Asian bites were average, and when the wings came, they tasted like they were microwaved and were even cold in the middle! Unfortunately, the only good part of the meal was the milestones California salad, but it only came with three pecans :("}
{"text":"Was a little nervous trying milestones again after a bad experience in Toronto, but this one made up for it! The server was excellent, and the food tasted much better. The beet salad and calamari I would recommend! Not so much the tuna sushi, not much flavour there. But all in all it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I was uber thrilled when Milestone's came to Calgary.  I used to work in Kitsilano (Vancouver) and some of my work mates & I were regulars at the 4th Ave location for lunch.  I've been to the one in South Calgary (Southcentre Parking lot) a few times with friends but since the downtown location is closer it's our Goto when we have the kids and want good food.  While it maintains a classy ambiance (no Boston Pizza decor here) it is quite family friendly.  Nice to see additional Milestones restaurants popping up around town as well.  Following a morning skating outing with friends at Olympic Plaza we decided to walk over for lunch hoping it wasn't to busy.  Success!  We managed to get in and get a great booth to cram the kidlets into.  My gf had the spicy tuna tacos and they were fabulous (I stole a bite or too).  All 4 kids either had pasta or chicken fingers from the kids menu (no complaints).  Hubs had a burger (tasty) and I opted for a simple salad I've been enjoying for years...the California spring salad with a side of potato/leek soup.   Service was good and the meal delivered as always.  This is what keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Milestones gets some bonus points for being willing to take on a party of 12, including a reservation. That's not something many of the middling level restaurants are willing to do.  We came in with our party, and they were all ready for us, bringing us to a long table. Service was really friendly, getting most of the food out in a coordinated fashion and keeping all the drinks nice and full.  My only real complaint was that the food was only okay. I went with the prime rib fettuccine, which was kinda bland and a little greasy. It could be that I just had a mediocre selection. Their beer selection was a little lacking, so I stuck to mixed drinks, which were quite nice.  Overall, this is a good place to take a large group for middling food but great service."}
{"text":"Great place to have a drink and sit out side. We had a decent meal, but our waitress Rose definitely bumped up our star rating. She actually deserves 5! What a doll!! Also, all the bartenders were super friendly. This place is hiring all the right people.  A very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the Eaton Centre/Ryerson area and want to sit on a sweet patio, Milestone's is your place. There are not a lot of good choices around here and between Jack Astor's or Milestone's, I think the latter has the leg up (better food, less smoky, less random club music). Yes, it's a chain restaurant and coming to this complex feels like your in the 'burbs, but you could do a lot worse. The decor is actually pretty nice and the large patio overlooking Yonge St. is fun in the summer. Look out for their daily specials. On Tuesdays bellinis are $4 if I remember correctly. A pretty sweet deal! The menu has a decent variety, not just standard and generic pub fare. The sliders are pretty good and I like their California spring salad. They've added some interesting-sounding new items like risotto balls (I wonder if they are like arancini?). Servers are usually pretty friendly and easy-going."}
{"text":"The food was okay, nothing spectacular, albeit the service was exceptional. I appreciated the ambiance. None the less all franchises are concerned with the bottom line. That being profit margins. Thus you can only expect so much out of food that is not produced from a place of passion."}
{"text":"Wheeee. Milestone's makes me happy. Especially this one since I love the patio ish thing where you can sit outside. Maybe not for the winter.   And it's fascinating. You can watch the H&M ad on the top of the mall over and over and over and oooooooooooooover... (if the conversation gets boring. Just careful to avoid the telltale glazed-over look...then your friend will get offended.)  As for food, it's Milestones. I think we all know what we're getting into. PS I love the spinach and artichoke dip. Well, I like it almost anywhere. Milestones does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great place for these reasons.. staff friendly and treat you like you're high end customers in highest end establishment. Shirts clean - not grease stained. In fact, for a place that's been open awhile, and given how nasty customers can be.. it's clean and polished. Food is good. Our new go to place after surviving Costco!"}
{"text":"Went in here with about a group of 15....this place was packed on a Thursday night and first time to a Mileston's....cool set up and def a good spot for large groups  We had pretty good service...but food was great and beers were cold....def a solid spot in the Dundas square."}
{"text":"My favorite part of this Milestone in Stephen Avenue is it's outdoor patio.  Pray for summer for 8 months, and enjoy it in Milestone patio for 4 months!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not a big fan of going to franchise brand restaurants but I was pleasantly surprised on my Sunday visit to this Milestone location. The place was pretty full when we arrived and the decor is quite nice. To begin with, my friend noticed that there was a CAA preferred dining sticker in the front of the entrance and when we asked about it, they actually said that if you have a CAA card, you get a free appetizer! YAY!!! We opted for the recommended goat cheese plate and it was delicious. I mean, who doesn't like arugula, roasted onions, goat cheese and focaccia? For our mains, we ordered the beef bolognese and chicken asiago pasta. They were quite good considering I didn't expect something SUPER spectacular. To top it off, our waitress was super friendly and we had a great dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Guh.   Ok, I came here with my wife and she knows from past experience I'm not a big fan of Milestones but we gave it yet another shot.   Came here for brunch and had the knife and fork sandwich.   Let me just be polite and say the food here is terrible.  The fruit bowl we ordered tasted like wet dish rags.  I disliked my experience so much that even writing the review seems like a waste of time.   I can't remember the last time I couldn't finish a meal at a restaurant?  Oh yeah, it was the last time I ate here and there were egg shells everywhere inside my corned beef hash breakfast.   Never again."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a client here today, Oct 2/15. This is a decent restaurant in terms of size & style. The menu is very limited & is lacks a decent nutritious lunch selections.   I decided to go with the Crispy Chicken sammy w no mayo & coleslaw on the side. Glad I did...the coleslaw was burn-your-head-off hot. WAY too hot for the sandwich in my opinion at least. My piece of chicken was destroyed. It was dry & over cooked by a lot.   Normally I would have said something & sent the food back but not with a client. I guess you live & learn. Next time...choose another restaurant!!"}
{"text":"This was the \"official\" dinner for my wife's 50th birthday. We went her cause we wanted a little more upscale but not crazy expensive. Our waitress was bubbly & delightful, smiling & polite. The food....not great. I had the 3 part meal combo. Mine was the meatloaf sliders with Koby mustard & crispy onion strings which were hot & tasty. The combo was with Portobello Mushroom Chicken & veggies. Pasta & Chicken were very good but the veggies were cold. Dessert was a Ganache Torte w ice cream which was good. Wife's was Caesar with grilled chicken & cheesecake. All good but not great.   I believe that if you position your restaurant as a quality house & your place is very quiet on a Sunday nite....you should turn out piping hot great quality food. Not the mediocre stuff we ate here.   I would spend my hard earned dollars at a place that over represents themselves again. Not a do-over."}
{"text":"This was an absolutely terrible experience for a meal. Let's start...the place was sweltering hot inside the restaurant. I ordered a Caesar Salad w extra salad dressing. Had to ask 3 times. My friend ordered a salad but the server missed the dressing. My other friend ordered a sandwich & the fries were \"forgotten\"?! The steak was undercooked for another meal! For my meal I had wilted fries & they were out of a key part of the meal of waffle & chicken!! They featured a meal & were missing a key part?!?! The place was old & broken down as well. There are tons of restaurants in the area...do yourself a favour...eat somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch on a Friday to celebrate a friends birthday. I usually like it here, but couldn't decide what I wanted, so I went with the Butternut Squash Ravioli. It was a lot different than I was expecting (in a tomato sauce with goat cheese and pecans) and I admit I wasn't a huge fan of it. The food was a little slow coming out and they accidentally charged me for the whole bottle of wine rather than just the glass. My girlfriend had raw bacon on her sandwich. All in all, it wasn't horrible, but I probably wont return."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a colleague and I ordered the fish taco. It was delicious and the portion was very huge. The fish itself wasn't fried or battered properly. It was not soggy but just not crunchy. But overall it was good. Portion was huge because it came with a ceasar salad. Only issue was that the ceasar salad didn't have any croutons. Well at least it has cheese.   The d√©cor here is nice and because I sat right beside the window, we got a nice view of the streets of Steven Ave.   overall, I enjoyed my lunch here and would come again."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I can't say I have a great time here each time. There's always something off whenever i come, either the service is bad or the food sucks.  Last time I went to Milestone, I went to try their Top Chef Canada menu. The entree was a fish and it was done in this weird sauce and the dessert was okay but not great. The prices were slightly more expensive than their regular menu since it was a special menu. The special items were not worth the extra $3-4 bucks.  The only thing I like here is their dip but I haven't been to a restaurant where they had bad dips.  This is one restaurant I try to avoid and whenever I do go, I go in with an open mind hoping they'll be better than the last time and I usually leave disappointed."}
{"text":"My bf & I came here for date night last night. It was about a 25 minute wait for a table on the patio, which wasn't too bad.   I love the patio at this location, it has a lot of tables but it's not too crammed.   We ordered the Coconut Calamari appetizer to start ($14.50). It was good, it was more meaty than I thought it would be, most places drench the calamari pieces in batter to the point where you can hardly taste the calamari, but that's not the case here!   I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Chicken ($22.75). It was good, the portobello mushroom sauce is kind of salty but overall I enjoyed it. It's a huge portion, I didn't finish it and had to take some home.   My boyfriend ordered the Cajun Shrimp Creole ($25.50). He said it was really good and has the right amount of spice.   I would've gave my experience here 5 stars but the service was a little slow, I get it was Friday night and it was busy but if that's the case they should have more servers working. We also weren't given cutlery. We waited a few minutes after our entrees arrived to see if our waiter would come back with utensils. He ended up coming over and asking how our meals tasted. It was kind of awkward telling him we hadn't started because we didn't have cutlery.   Other than the slow service, I'd come here again and take advantage of their patio season"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, but a little too crowded for my liking.  Good service, nice and friendly, but too slow at times.  Their spinach and artichoke dip was absolutely delicious!  Roaster mushrooms on the side were ok, but had an overpowering aftertaste. Me and a friend ordered prime rid steak, and both ended up very disappointed. The meat was very fatty, and not very flavourful. Ended up having an upset stomach for the rest of the night... They do have a nice selection of appetizers and drinks for very nice prices. I will come back for a drink with friends and an appetizer but would not risk having another steak."}
{"text":"I've been to this enterprise location a couple of times and a milestones regular but never had the time to write a review. Ever since the markham location moved from warden and 7 to this new location, I feel the quality of the food has improved but the service definitely declined significantly. My 2 most recent visits to milestones, I had mediocre service at best.  The earlier visit, we were assigned a trainee server, she told us she was in training so our expectations were low. She didn't take our order with pen and paper, so practically every item was completely forgotten and needed to be taken twice. When 2 of our friends ordered a prime rib med rare, she entered the order as med well...which her mentor had to come confirm. The more recent visit, our server was not attentive, absent most of the time and very forgetful to all our requests. The food and menu have definitely improved after the move. Staples like prime rib got juicier, portobello chicken is great as usual...portions got smaller across the board, especially the appetizers. Burgers also switched to better buns and patties so its more memorable. I enjoy milestones but prefer going to the further Richmond Hill Location due to better service."}
{"text":"Wow this Milestones has gone downhill since the last time I've been here. I came here tonight for a colleague's farewell drinks and dinner. First things first, the waiter did not have any personality for his job. Sorry but I know you were over our table after we sent back COLD AND SOGGY calamari but your personality does not fit the role. He seemed tired of us. He did check up time to time but for being there 3 hours (some friends for 4 hours), time to time is not acceptable. We had to flag him or some other servers down. Anyways, our drinks were super slow. No one cared to update us or anything. I was also SO disappointed. $13.75 for 2 measly lettuce wraps!!!!! Joeys probably costs the same but they give you a little more. It was salty AF but because we already returned a dish and I was super hungry, I just ate it and ordered another fish taco to satisfy my hunger.  Definitely disappointed about this place. It was busy being in dundas square but again, just not a good experience at all. I will not consider milestones for dinner going forward. Overpriced and terrible service."}
{"text":"Horrible service today! I understand that it was Pride today but the service had nothing to do with that. We were a bit late because of Pride, (so many people and so much congestion and cut offs) so they did not accomidate what we asked for. We had a seat on the patio with a wobbly table. We asked of we could move to the table across that was empty and were told that it was too much trouble to switch our bill in the system!! We asked for a manager who after arguing with us finally agreed to let us switch but no one wiped it down so we were sitting in other peoples crud. They were incredibly rude and unprofessional. Every 2 seconds someone would walk by and not ask if we were ok or take any dirty dishes, and if they did we wpuld have mentioned our order was wrong!!! We ended up just paying the bill and getting the hell put of dodge because we didnt want to complain any more seeing how it falls on deaf ears anyways. The food was not great, very salty spinich dip and my salad was bland. The drinks were really yummy...but we had to wait forever because when we switched tables it was to confusing for them :S very disappointed"}
{"text":"The worst experience at this location. Will not go back again. The enterprise Markham location is by far the best.  My friends arrived from Asia and Niagara and leaving the next day for Montreal. I made a huge mistake suggesting this location. There's no care in the preparation of the food. Basic prime rib not available at 7:45pm? And the place is half empty.  Returned my cod cos it was so over cooked the edges tasted like cardboard. Unacceptable because I specifically asked for the sauces to come on the side but it was all over the cod.  My friends steak was cold??!!!! It's a steak and the waitress had the gall to say it was perfect and it wasn't that way. Even though we had our meals redone this shouldn't have happened.  Basic food and yet they couldn't even do that  No effort no care no business  And we were a group of 10! Paid over $330! What a waste!"}
{"text":"I have been to this Milestone's location probably 3-4 times and I have always had a great time *I have been to other Milestone's, particularly the Yonge and Sheppard location, and the food was the same throughout  The most recent time I was there, we decided to just get a salad and share some apps  We got the California Summer Salad  This is my FAV salad and it is ALWAYS A must when I go to Milestones It has Goat cheese, strawberries, pecans, and is just perfect And I do like that they are not stingy with the goat cheese  Then we shared the appetizer platter (calamari, asian chicken bites, coconut shrimp) The calamari were great but they ALWAYS are - perfectly cooked and not too breaded The chicken bites were also very tasty; I was impressed that they weren't deepfried and were very lightly breaded The shrimp was good but the sauce had too much of a honey taste for my liking We finished with the butterscotch dessert (I don't remember the name but they call it their take on a creme brulee) The service was great Milestone's is DEFINITELY my favourite out of all the \"chain\" restaurants and is WAY better than Moxie's"}
{"text":"I remember Milestone's being great around 10 years ago. Now, not so much. I ordered my go-to, the spinach and artichoke dip. I was so disappointed to see that they have changed it from how it used to be back in the day! It used to be super cheesy, warm, and delicious. Now, there seemed to be no cheese in it at all. We got the chorizo flatbread as well, which was pretty awful. I definitely do not recommend it. The service also wasn't great- no one came to refill water, they never cleared empty plates, left the menus on the table after we ordered, etc. Honestly it was a bit of a bizarre experience. However, as others have said, they have great drink specials, and the patio is awesome!"}
{"text":"I visit this place about once every two months. I normally prefer not to waste my dining-out experience on big chains, but I really like the atmosphere here. Especially on 'off' days when it isn't very crowded.   This past Sunday my hubby and I when there just to relax. We ordered a pitcher of Mojitos. Superbly delicious. We took our time going over the menu. Our server was very educated on the specials and helped us choose some yummy grub to munch on. The manager swung by a couple of times to see if we were enjoying our food. We were trying their seasonal appetizer and he was curious to hear our review, as many people had sent the dish back and we had not. It was the Lobster and Crab Sweet Potato Frites. It is basically sweet potato fries with lobster, crab and some veggies on top, served with a side of lightly spiced curry sauce. We really liked it, and passed this on to the manager, who appreciated what we had to say and took the app off our bill. I also had the Cajun Shrimp Diane. It is now my second favourite dish on the menu. The first being the Grilled Mediterranean Chicken and the third being the Four Cheese Burger. I make myself try other things Milestones has to offer, but I find it really hard to move away from the above mentioned meals."}
{"text":"In regards to Justin G.'s comment about having to walk through the restaurant to get to a host, this predicament has been solved. We were greeted at the mall entrance and asked whether we preferred the bar or dinning room. The dinning room was fairly quiet for an area with lots of traffic going past, but it was a Monday.   The service was attentive at first, but the drink hadn't been updated to reflect their lack of Molson M on tap. I was flexible with my drink choice, but I feel that that information should have been relayed to us beforehand. For dinner, we ordered the sausage ravioli and a cheeseburger. The waiter got my friend's cheeseburger order correct (minus this...add that...etc etc.) which is impressive, but the fries were ice cold and hard. I'm sure they were sitting for quite a while before being serve, a no no in my book. Fries are suppose to be the crispy goodness juxtaposition to a juicy burger. These fries were just sad and I didn't want to go back and steal some more (and usually I steal about half!). My ravioli weren't much better. The filling was dry, instead of being luxious and creamy. I've had better store bought ravioli. There were three sauces over the pasta, basil pesto, creamy garlic and a marinara sauce. The tomato sauce was bright and fresh, but it was overpowered by the pesto. It tasted to grassy and made the whole experience unenjoyable.   I visited this location about a year ago and had a delicous braised lamb dish. This was no longer on the menu (I would have gotten that if it was). And unfortunately the quality of the food didn't live up to my expectations. I might go back for drinks, but I think i will have to be a bit more choosy with my food."}
{"text":"If i could give lower score. I would  Party event :Waited 3 hours for a boil prime rib. Not recommended for party. Taste like shit.  But the washroom are nice 10 out of 10 would come back to shit again"}
{"text":"Maybe I was hungry, but I had a great meal at this chain restaurant in Yorkdale. The staff were friendly and open to questions. I had the sirloin strip with rice and vegetables. Although I didn't add any special sauce, the meat was cooked well (I got medium). My sister also had the same meal except with mashed potatoes. The potatoes weren't as good, but the steak was the main star of meal, so it was fine. Overall, this Milestones satisfied my expectations for a popular chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Was here for a friend's bday on a Saturday night (last night). I realize it's a Milestones so I def checked my expectations at the door. Still, they managed to disappoint despite the extremely low bar set by previous experiences. It wasn't a busy night, but the service was still exceedingly slow and in attentive. We basically got one round of drinks and food ordered and were left to our own devices for the rest of the excruciatingly long 2hr dinner. Food was subpar even by Milestones standards. We all ordered different things ranging from Ahi Tuna salad (I ordered it), harissa chicken, and tacos to pastas. Not one person responded that the meal was good or ok. Anyways, I won't be back and I'm posting this just to remind myself that, with Yelp as my witness, if I ever go to another Milestones I will only have myself to blame and, to quote the Simpsons (Season 6, episode 14, Bart's Comet), \"may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow\"."}
{"text":"I love this Milestones!   The Sunday brunch was great. I had the salmon benny and a raspberry mimosa while my date had a burger and fries. Between our two servers, it was prompt and very friendly. They both came to check on us often and ensured our meals were good.   What I loved most about this location is the lighting situation in the bar area. I loved the reclaimed wood feel they had going on with the single bulb light fixtures. I can't wait to try out their patio in the summer."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed Milestones.  I especially love their spinach dip, California spring salad, crispy chicken sandwich, California eggs benny, baked goat cheese and roasted garlic appy & butternut squash ravioli.   I can't exactly rate Milestone's for their food because it's a chain restaurant - it's supposed to be good food. I mostly rate the locations now based on service. This location is great. I often leave satisfied, but keep in mind I'm usually only at Milestone's for drinks/appys/dessert. I cannot comment on the steak experiences because they were in the past; it's likely owner has changed since then. I haven't given their dinner options (steak etc) a second chance and don't see it happening in the foreseeable future.   For the social aspect where you enjoy some finger foods and drinks with friends, I'll always suggest Milestone's."}
{"text":"I came here before a concert because I had been waiting for a table at Joeys for 45 minutes even though they said it would only be 15. So we decided to walk over to Milestones since we were hungry.The place was pretty busy but we got a table right away. The waitress seemed super rushed as it seemed she was helping a lot of tables as well as a large private party all at the same time.   I ordered the Asian chicken bites and the classic burger. The chicken bites were great. Super flavourful and pretty filling as an appetizer. The burger on the other hand is why they are getting 3 stars. I asked for no lettuce and no tomato on my burger and the waitress brings out a plain burger. On the menu it said the burger came with cheese and bacon. But instead she gave me a completely naked burger, if I wanted a plain burger I would have gone to McDonald's and not paid $16 for one. I asked where the toppings of my burger went and she's like oh I assumed you wanted nothing on it.... I guess she was just overwhelmed by the number of tables she had or something.   Other then that though it was a good experience and the food was pretty good. Can't really say if I'll be back or not though."}
{"text":"Four of us went to dinner at Milestones last night.  Humza was most obliging and made room for us even though we didn't have a reservation.  We had drinks and then our food arrived.  It was very good.  The Salmon was delicious and one had a hamburger and fries and one had the crispy chicken.  It did get a little noisy, but it was nice to sit at the window and watch the people go by.  It wasn't my first visit and probably won't be my last.  Thank you for the great service. E.Middleton"}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this piece of shit restaurant? I came here once for my anniversary and I was waiting for my date for about 30 minutes, and my server didn't even glance at me - level 2 customer service. I asked for water and he didn't bring it until my date arrived, and by that time she noticed the look on my face and knew what had just happened. She's a very stern woman so she immediately took action by raising her voice to a reasonable level while asking for water and one more menu. It took the serve 10 minutes to bring us a damn menu and glass of water. We ordered our food - my date has an allergy to pepper, so we asked for NO SEASONING. The food came, and one bite in, my date had a migraine and was starting to swell. We explained the situation and promptly left without paying (we didn't eat anything) to go to the emergency room. Where was the manager? Making jokes with the dumbass tavern girls and idiot bartender while his servers were crashing under the pressure - fire this manager.  The second time we went (we decided to give it another try), we weren't in a hurry, we were relaxed, calm, we got water on time, we order the Thai bites (without sauce) as an appetizer, and everything seemed to be going fine! Until our server started complaining to us about her life. She was complaining about the management in the restaurant, other employees, and how every guest does not tip her enough. Needless to say, I was pissed at her. When it came time to pay, she literally said, \"don't be stingy on the tip\" straight to my face. So, instead of typing 15% for poor service and mediocre food, I typed 0% for begging. I left her a loonie on the table with a note under it. I asked to see the manager as I was leaving and the hostess said, \"sure, one second\". I waited 20 minutes before just giving up and leaving.  Overall this place is shit. Don't go. You're better off at Jack Astors or Shark Club. Hell, Subway is right downstairs and they give better service. This place is bullshit and has shirty food with an incompetent wait staff. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"3 stars for the menu + one star for the location, which overlooks Yonge street - access it directly through the North York station!   I typically order steak here and the drinks are quite good too. They have a pretty good selection for gluten-free customers so check that out if you're in the area looking for gluten-free food.  There is a LOT of seating on the second floor and the booths are cosy with lots of sunlight during the afternoon. It's not usually too busy, which is just fine by me!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people like to hate on Milestones; it's reliable and the service is fairly consistent. My order is right 95% of the time I come here and the waitstaff will accommodate all kinds of requests so you pretty much have control over what you get. The bar area can be a bit too loud for my taste and the washrooms are quite a trek from the main seating area - take wide turns to avoid colliding with speed-walking employees."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this Milestones despite passing by its location so many times. We were there for drinks only and that was fine by them. Sitting on their unique patio should have been unique, and it was, but given the angle and the height ends up being a disappointing experience as one does not have a view of anyone or anything much save for the same digital billboards hawking the same corporate product or whatever.  The person showing us to the table was polite and professional and did his very best to accommodate our requests for a spot and the ideal table. Our waitress was also polite, but her service was disappointing because she  was very slow and would disappear forever. It may have been because she was so busy or otherwise, but at one point we became tired of waiting and went in search of someone to take our orders.  The cocktail menu was fine, but once we placed the order had to rethink it because the waitress returned to inform us that they are missing a couple of the ingredients. That killed another while for us and lead to our having to choose second choices.  The restaurant was packed inside and outside and was clean in the dining room, but the washroom could use some work.  I have not been to the Jack Astors next door in a while, but they may be a better option given the angle of their patio, although they are not as roomy and may be more difficult to get into. Otherwise Milestones' drinks would do."}
{"text":"At first we were going to let the reviews deter us from this place. So glad we didn't. The food was amazing. The Sesame Ginger Bowl and The Portobello Mushroom Chicken were amazing. The service was fast and very good. I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere. Don't know why this has such a low rating. Its far better than others with higher ratings. Been here many  times always been consistent and good."}
{"text":"Not very good on all fronts.  The food is mediocre at best.  The service is either fawning or cold and detached.  This is another formula chain that has tasteless food that is not up to par for the prices they charge.  Would not go back.  The washroom was also dirty.  This speaks to the monitoring of the cleanliness and was a turn off on how clean the kitchen was."}
{"text":"Didn't end up staying and left to go elsewhere to eat dinner. Pretty disappointing because we were told no seats in the dining room were available yet there were two visible booths available from the entrance. Hostess said that it was a 25 minute wait yet we couldn't be seated in the booths because reservations were arriving in 20 minutes. It would have made more sense to seat us when something would have become available to accommodate the reservations that were going to arrive within the 20 minute time frame. I would've expected better from a large restaurant."}
{"text":"If you want your time wasted for subpar food, this is the place to go.  My friend and I had a 5pm reservation on a Wednesday and were seated a bit early as the place was quite empty. After waiting for 20 minutes we were finally approached by our waiter, who proceeded to ignore our request to order food and drinks, and instead told us he would be back soon with some water and would take our orders then. The water took 15 minutes to arrive. So after 35 minutes we finally were able to order our food. Then of course our waiter disappeared again and we did not see him until the food came out, after waiting for 40 minutes. The food was terrible and not worth the wait. I had ordered a chicken Parmesan with seasonal vegetables and pasta tossed in a creamy pesto sauce. The \"seasonal vegetables\" were 3 spears of asparagus and a slice of red pepper. The pasta was an absolute joke--if pesto could be a dry seasoning, then the pasta was virtually plain noodles with pesto seasoning sprinkled on top. The chicken had a weird peachy-tomato salsa on top that did not taste good at all. Being ravenous, my friend and I devoured our meals in 15 minutes, then proceeded to wait another 15 for the waiter to come back so we could ask for our bills. The bills took another 10 minutes, and lo and behold I needed to pay with my card so he needed to go get the machine, and take time to do so. Not only that, he proceeded to take my card with him, and slipped it into his back pocket as he went to get the machine (that is so unprofessional--my card should not leave the table like that). Paying the bill took 35 minutes all together, which is absolutely crazy as the place wasn't even that busy.  Waited around for 2.5 hours, ate for 15 minutes. Please don't waste your time and money on such an unprofessional establishment."}
{"text":"Service was good but food definitely very underwhelming!  The veggie burger literally consisted of just a bun, patty, lettuce and tomato. And ketchup and mayo on the side."}
{"text":"Hey Milestones   My family loves your restaurants. They're definitely consistent, which is great. We've always had excellent, friendly and efficient service and the ambience is lovely. Having said that, I've been going to Milestones for years and now nothing has changed.   I realize that you're a chain, and easier said than done but it's time to spice up your menu a bit and stay current! Experiment with some new flavours for the foodies! Toss a couple of vegan friendly options in there for the herbivores! Milestones has a good thing going on, but it's too easy to overlook that in favour of something new and more exciting."}
{"text":"I had a lunch there with a client and three coworkers.  It was busy and apparently are meals were taking longer than usual.  The manager came over to apologize.  We were talking so hadn't even noticed.  Good customer service.  It's been a while since I've been at a Milestone's and I remembered that the Red Curry Chicken Bowl is delicious and that's what I ordered ... and it was delicious.  It would be nice if they replaced the crunchy side crackers (or whatever they are) with naan."}
{"text":"I had lunch today with friends at Milestone's on the Queensway in Etobicoke.  Angie, Amanda, Anita and Vitra each had the Ultimate Brunch Bundle for $18.99. They came with a Mimosa (they had raspberry) and started with a fruit plate.  Angie, Amanda and Anita had the Grilled Shrimp California Benedict (two Grade A poached eggs topped with house-made Hollandaise sauce, grilled shrimp, double-smoked bacon and house-made avocado salsa on English muffin slices, served with breakfast potatoes topped with their Mediterranean salsa). Amanda didn't want shrimp so got extra bacon instead.  Vitra had a Spinach and Feta Omelette (fresh chopped spinach, crumbed feta cheese slice button mushrooms and diced Romano tomatoes, served with breakfast potatoes topped with their Mediterranean salsa and multi-grain toast).  They ate most of their meals so I'm assuming they enjoyed them.  I didn't feel like brunch so ordered the Red Curry Chicken Bowl (chicken breast, red peppers, green onions, Thai red curry coconut cream, jasmine rice and steamed Asian greens). I got it without the greens (I find they are too mushy).  It's what I usually order at Milestone's and it was good.  Sandra was our server and took good care of us. The place was packed so service was a bit slower than we'd expected but we were busy yakking so didn't mind."}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper this evening at Milestone's.  We sat on the patio.  When we had walked by earlier on our way to the beer festival, they were giving our coupons ... a Bellini and an appetizer for $10.  So we used the coupons.  For his appetizer, Gord ordered the Crispy Phyllo Shrimp ... he said they were delicious.  I ordered the Crispy Asian Chicken Bites ... they were really spicy and good.  For his main, Gord ordered Haddock & Frites.  It was good ... what a lot of food, though.  He wasn't able to finish it.  I ordered Prime Rib (medium well).  The potatoes were good and the meat was okay (it was kind of gristley).  I wasn't expecting the appetizer to be so big so I ate the prime rib and a bit of potatoes ... and then I was full.  Sarah was our server and she was friendly."}
{"text":"Gord and I had a late lunch/early supper today at Milestones.  Surprisingly we've never been there.    We sat in the dining room.  We sat by the window.  The patio was closed because it had been raining.  Gord ordered Cajun Shrimp Creole.  He said it was really good.  The sauce had a nice snap but wasn't overly spicy.  He said he'd get it again.  I ordered an Old Fashioned Burger, with no lettuce or onions, and I got mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar cheese.  Plus I swapped my fries for mashed potatoes.  It was a good burger and the patty was tasty.  The mashed potatoes were good too ... garlicy and a bit dry.  I'd get it again.  Rose was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"In celebration of my Aunts 90th Birthday we all met at Milestones in Whitby., I have to say the staff were all friendly and service was great. We started off with calamari and various dips while we chatted and had a few drinks. What to order so much to choose from on the menu. I had a Caesar salad and spicy Thai rolls. Basically a warm tomatoe wrap with chicken and jasmine rice. Very tasty. All good was fresh and hot. Milestones always tried and true."}
{"text":"I've had Milestones before.  It's a typical Cara restaurant, dressed up.  This location was a real disappontment.  On a few occasions, I found the staff uncooperative and impolite.  My last visit was the final straw.  Our entr√©es took 1+ hours to arrive and while waiting, our server avoided us like the plague.  She didn't come by to apologize, offer to refill our drinks, etc.  When the meal came, it was cold.  When I told her to take it back, she had the cajones to show irritation towards me.    I left without eating my main course.  That was the first and only time I have ever tipped $0."}
{"text":"Our server was friendly, helpful, and very enthusiastic. The food....I wouldn't say \"it was a disappointment\" because our app, sticky ribs, was good, just not enough, though. My wife's Ahi Tuna Salad was fair...dressing was good....but something is missing.... My Salmon & Salsa....I asked for medium (pink in the middle)...it stayed on 10-15 seconds too long, and it was overcooked. The atmosphere was nice, but the music is a little too loud. Having said all that, I'm just surprised that the Keg next to it has better rating...."}
{"text":"The lightening is a little too dark here. Our waiter kept forgetting the details of our order including the Pepsi that my friend ordered. It later had to be \"on the house\" because she got it halfway through our entree. The location does possess a nice view of the ambience of Dundas street....nothing tops that really.   The presentation of the ultimate fish tacos was restaurant professional. Compared to price it is definitely not value for money. The fish was nicely battered and crisp. However the Caesar that came on the side was horrible. It had two extra large chunks of croutons that was so soggy. I found one piece of bacon at the bottom of the salad and there was too much dressing. I was disappointed with my meal given the great location of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible. Just plain awful. Pricey food in a great location that has poorly cooked and presented food. Servers were great. But the cooks need replacing"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of the prices. the food isn't worth it, in my opinion. The girls night deal is good! Bellinis were yummy and the sweet potato fries and flatbread plate were very very good!"}
{"text":"Just doing a rating based on their takeout prime rib sandwich.  Probably the best prime rib i've ever tried. It was juicy and not chewy.  I really recommend it to anyone who likes beef sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ive been to milestones probably 5 times ever and never enjoyed the food but didnt hate it either.  Tried there crab cake and burger thing and have to say it was a let down. The crab cake and burger tasted frozen and had no taste.  As for the restaurant its really nice. Nice huge heated patio.  The waiters there are also really friendly.  Its a good place to go hang out and drink and have some appetizers if anything."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of burgers and was shocked by the quality of what I was able to have at Milestones. I was expecting something mediocre but I would say it was easily comparable to burgers priest or p&l burger.  Girlfriend got the seafood platter which she said was good and had great variety but she would have hoped that there would be more shrimp than was provided.  The service here was good, hostess and waiter were both friendly, so we will definitely be coming back to grab dinner, prices were totally reasonable as well.  Also would definitely recommend taking advantage of the patio while the weather holds up it was very nice view and great for people watching on John street."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere is outstanding.  This place is on my (very short) places I would like to go back to."}
{"text":"Drinks were terrible, ordered the sangria and peach Bellini. Both were very watered down and too sweet. For apps we ordered three cheese bread, calamari and fish tacos. Mediterranean chicken, prime rib for mains. All was very underwhelming. Not worth the price or the calories. Would have been better to stay home."}
{"text":"I dont see what made this so great. It sure isnt because of the prices. Cant be because of the food. The service tho? Perfect. Overall the rest of it sucks. Dont wish to go into detail just rather not relive ever eating such tasteless food."}
{"text":"This was a rather decent place.  Not too noisy or slow.  The menu included many items that I'd consider trying.  The meatloaf that I had was good, but nothing special.  The calamari was better than average, partly because they cut it as steaks instead of tentacles or rings, but again nothing to make this a go-to place.  Near the movie theater and Eaton shopping is a bonus, and there is a deficit of decent places to eat in this part of Toronto.  And that's what this place is, decent.  So if I catch myself hungry again in this area and there's no line or party going on then I'd consider eating here again, but I'll never make it a destination.  I should point out that it is a bit pricey compared to other places with the same food quality and selection.  The meals are in the $17-$21 range + drinks + appetizer + HST + tip and it could make for a surprising final bill for the budget minded.  But personally I'd rather pay a little more than put up with Jack Astor's next door or risk food poisoning at the sketchy dives that fill this part of town."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my wife here thanksgiving and it was pretty dead.   Food was very bland, I had tacos and calamari. Pint of Stella was $8.50 and took a long time to pour. I'll be honest, my wife did say she liked here chicken sandwich but I feel she was just trying to lighten my mood.   Decor is some what nice for the area but felt more like a hotel restaurant.   I would not go back."}
{"text":"I have to visit Toronto quite frequently for work and sometimes stay in a hotel near this restaurant, so I have visited this branch multiple times. Service in general is pretty good, but food quality/standard is mediocre. Last time I ordered the prime ribs, the steak itself was excellent, but the mash potato and the green beans are barely warm. This time I ordered the steak frites. The steak again was cooked perfectly, but the fries were lame and string union rings cold and doughy. The kitchen department needs to bring up a notch."}
{"text":"The service is very slow, we need to find the waitress to order, the choice for dessert is limited, but the food is good, I tried fire-grilled salmon with jasmine rice, the salmon is tender and the plate is warm. The menu would be better if there are pictures on it. The atmosphere is relaxing."}
{"text":"It's a solid 3/5 (if that gives you any consolation).  Great location with patio.  Food is nothing special.  I had a burger and the ground chuck was not juicy or flavorful. The egg bun tasted fresh and was just the right amount of bun. The California side salad (extra) was delicious with candied pecans.   My friend's chicken parmigiana was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Noodles were tossed in butter or olive oil with a bit of garlic.   I checked out their nutritional information menu online as I like to eat healthy when I can and everything is very high in salt (sodium). It is nice to be able to see how many calories are in each item but there are very few healthy options unless you go with a salad with nothing tasty in it and then why pay so much for it?   Service was good. Temperature inside was good (given the humidity outside).   Bathroom was clean but I wish it had a full length mirror as this is a popular date place.   So many better places to go but sometimes this is an easy choice as you know what to expect and there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"The food was very good! They have so many choices that it was hard for me to choose. Excellent customer service; our waitress was just great. The cocktails are also amazing."}
{"text":"Visited Milestone's on a Wednesday and it was pretty busy for a weekday. The new location looks nice and is a welcome update to their previous location. Conveniently next to the new Cineplex, this makes for a decent option to pair with a movie.  Service was ok, the staff was friendly and food came out within 10 minutes. Food wise, the portions were average to small in my opinion. I had the Portobello Mushroom Chicken which had only a few slices of mushroom with the chicken on a bed of noodles.  With so many other restaurant options with similar style of food around, I don't think this would be a top of mind pick however I wouldn't mind dropping in once in a while if I'm already in the plaza."}
{"text":"I went there for my Birthday. It was the best hamburger I have ever had! My mom says it is her favorite restaurant. We will go back"}
{"text":"I want to preface this review by saying our server was absolutely fantastic. My mother organized a birthday dinner for my father and decided on Milestones. Christian was humorous, friendly and ensured our table was well taken care of - in the midst of training a new employee. That's dedication right there.   The disappointing part was the food. This is the second time I've been to Milestones and it'll be the last time. The food isn't all that great.   I ordered a special from their \"cheese extravaganza\" menu. I don't know why I went with steak when I generally reject steak from establishments that aren't steakhouses.  The steak was medium rare as requested but cold. I asked for extra bleu cheese and it arrived as requested but it too was cold. It's supposed to be room temp, slightly warmed by the meat.   The \"mac and cheese\" turned out to be pasta shells with a greasy cheese sauce.  I finished the steak and left the pasta. The entire plate was a cold, oily mess that congealed - leaving me feeling disgusted and upset. What a waste of $27.00.  Christian asked if I wanted anything else. I appreciated his help but I politely declined. I was feeling disappointed with the entire experience.  Later that night I was sick to my stomach.   Never again."}
{"text":"We've been here several times before and loved the place especially when this location first opened. Unfortunately, this evening was definitely our least favourite visit.   We've always ordered the calamari, but tonight's portion was WAY smaller than usual. The waitress said they added more dried noodles, but that was definitely a white lie. The lime with the calamari was also DRY, which was pretty gross. Not worth $14.50. The rest of our meal was decent.  The service was incredibly slow, especially when the restaurant was half empty. Hostesses were running everywhere. We even saw several guests walk in trying to wave down staff to be seated. Clearly understaffed. We also had to listen to another customer complaining to a \"manager?\" due to the fact that they stood right in front of our booth."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced restaurants aren't easy to find if you're attending anything at the Telus Convention Center.   A&W doesn't count, not if you want healthy (i.e., low fat) fare.    Our lunch today was very good, the beer was cold, the salads delicious, but the most enjoyable aspect was the service.  D'Arcy, a very nice young lady, our server,  was engaging, personable, cheerful, attentive (to the point of noticing we got the wrong salad dressing) and simply great at her job.  She deserves recognition for the fact we'll go back (even if we're not attending a convention)."}
{"text":"Good service usually. NEVER come on a Saturday if you don't like waiting and value peace and quiet. We sat there for 50 minutes waiting... There was a group of at least 30 other people and no one had been sat down. We were the first ones there too. I've been in downtown Toronto so many times and waited less time than this. We were told it would be 25 minutes. In the end it was double that. If they told us 50 minutes from the start we would have just left. Good food, but not good enough to be worth this hassle."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! Nice atmosphere, great place to watch a game. Ordered the California burger, the meat was a little dry but other than that it was pretty ok. The fries were delicious. Everybody else on my table seemed to enjoy their meal."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong about licking your plate in public if it's lickable. Milestone's butternut squash ravioli with feta cheese turned me vegetarian for an hour and a half. It was tangy, sweet and refreshing!  The sea food fettuccine in comparison wasn't half as delightful: it was too greasy and lacked flavor.  Our server was a hoot, the patio wasn't moot. We were far away from the clash of civilizations unfolding below us in Dundas Square. The weather gods cooperated and a lovely time was had by all."}
{"text":"We decided to try the prime rib at milestones for the first time.  Have always been a big fan of the prime rib at the Keg.   We arrived at the resturant at 5pm, and it was fairly quiet. Ordered the 12 oz, and was told the rarest possible cut was medium - medium rare.  And mash potatoes are not available. This seems very strange to me why a resturant that's known to serve good quality prime rib would not have any medium rare available.  The explanation from our server was it was sold out and it takes 12 hours to make it.  My initial guess was the new prime rib has not finished cooking, so I asked our server to ask the kitchen if my assumption was correct.  I also mentioned I would wait for the new prime rib, if possible.  Unfortunately the response was negative. So i had to go ahead with the order.  The dish arrived and the cut looks like it's been under the heater for many hours.  And appears to be well done.  Refer to photos.   This leads me one of the following two assumptions.  1.  The prime rib available at 5pm was left over from yesterday, from under the meat heater or oven for so long.  Of course it's well done.  But I am doubting why a well known national chain would do that. This will just hurt their reputation.  So this makes me come to the 2nd assumption.  2.  The machine or oven to cook the prime rib for 12 is malfunctioning.  Hence over cooking the prime rib.  When our server came up and asked how our food was, it is obvious the prime rib was not done right.  So he informed me that he is going to call the manager.    While I was writing up the yelp review, going to give it an one star. The manager came to our table and sincerely apologized.  She was very kind and sincere with a fresh dish of prime rib in her hands.  Too bad I don't have an infinite appetite. 2nd Prime rib is pink in color and appears to be medium rare. See photos.    She explained the cook cut the incorrect side of the prime rib, hence being well done the first try.  She also mentioned the mash potato is now available and would offer some.   To conclude, I will not comment on how the well done entree tasted like.  The 2nd attempt looked good; but in comparison, Keg still had the edge.  When we left the restaurant, the manager offered us some free apps for our next visit.  With all the above in mind, I've decided to add one more star to my initial review."}
{"text":"Did not go in for food.  Was early or the movie so I stepped for a beer to watch the jays game.  Overall feels great, staff were very friendly.  The best part is the Mill Street draft only cost $4.  Sat for about 30 mins and headed over to Cineplex."}
{"text":"Against my better judgement, when my boyfriend decided he wanted to try Milestones for dinner, I went along with it. I had an absolutely horrible experience at the Scarborough location (not once, but TWICE), but I figured it could just be that location and figured I'd give it a try.  We came in on a Tuesday night and it wasn't very busy so we were sat in a booth right away, a little too close to the door for my liking, but what can you do ;) Our server came by and took a drink order while we poked around at the menu. I wasn't really sure what I felt like and I think my bf was a little unsure of the menu but eventually we figured it out - he ordered the lamb and a caesar salad to start and I ordered the scallops main.  Our server brought out the caesar first and since I can't resist caesar I fully stole some - and HOLY GARLIC. Wow... thank god both of us had some or I wouldn't have been able to go near him later that  night. So much garlic that I had a few bites and didn't want anymore. When our server came to pick up the mostly empty bowl, we commented on how overly garlicky it was and he just said 'oh yeah our caesar is really garlicky' and walked away. I'm sorry but when the garlic BURNS the the tip of your tongue (that unpleasant garlic burn) that's TOO MUCH garlic.   My main arrived, scallops on a bed of jasmine rice with curry and some veggies and it was pretty good. It wasn't fantastical but it was good. I think I was expecting bigger and better quality scallops. Given, I had at least 6 or more on my plate, but for that kind of dish, with the presentation they had, I would have preferred 3/4 larger scallops with the dish. I don't know that I'd order it again though, it just didn't rock my boat. The lamb didn't look all that wonderful when it arrived. Our server had gone on about how it was Canadian lamb and that made the taste different - my boyfriend didn't comment on that- but we both were expecting a chop, not a piece of loin. Perhaps its specified on the menu but I know he was really disappointed in his dinner and frankly, looking at his plate, I was too.  A few notes about the service here: when your customers comment that there's something excessive about the taste of a dish (to a fault), don't just brush it off. This is one of my biggest pet peeves with the entire Milestones franchise. You're happy to charge us prices for premium food (which I have no problem paying) but when I bring up a concern, your servers don't give a crap about it. Poor service that will keep me from ever going back to a Milestones and should keep you (the reader) away as well. As well, while our server seemed friendly at the beginning, he seemed to be forcing it, and I've seen that before with Milestones. I don't like it when people try to fake conversation or be friendly with me when they don't want to. He also seemed insanely distracted, whenever we were speaking to him, he was checking out his other tables.   Overall, for over $70 for the two of us, the experience and the food wasn't worth it. I would have been happier going to a lower end restaurant that I know I'll get good food at and paying a fraction of the price for it. It was a nice meal for a date, good atmosphere and whatnot, but the whole experience was seriously lacking, especially on the food - and I came there to eat, I won't be going back. Take your money to the Keg for a great meal or head on over to Montanas or Jack's for some good food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Well I'm always up for giving a restaurant a second chance. Everybody's entitled to have a bad day at the office. I came in this time for dinner service and chose a table instead of the bar. I figured I'll order a steak I mean seriously who can screw up a steak?  Top sirloin with an upgrade to Caesar salad and some shrimp. Looks good on the menu. This is arrived and tasted good if slightly overdressed. Then the main course arrived, well I guess milestones can still screw up a steak. I ordered rare, and the waiter confirmed with me that I wanted rare, weird. When it arrived the toppings were cold and the steak wasn't even close to where in fact I would put it past medium on its way to dead. I put my guard down and waited for the follow up so I can get it corrected. The follow up never happened, after 10 minutes I had to start waving to get my waiters attention. After showing him the carnage there was no question that a refine or was required. When the replacement meal arrived the guy who delivered it waited to ensure that it was prepared properly. My waiter showed up much later when the plate was almost empty to follow up. I was offered the standard issue dessert or additional salad which was weird because I'd already have a salad, clearly management believes in cookie-cutter service. The waiter then followed up 10 minutes later offering me desert again. Apparently saying \"I don't eat dessert\" the first time was not convincing enough for him. I don't blame the waiter, it was a busy night, I blame management tip to tail. When you show up twice and get the same crappy quality control and lackluster service you know management is an issue. Now that cactus club is in Ontario they are going to kill these guys just like they did in BC."}
{"text":"It's funny before I moved here I had never even considered milestones.  But now it has to be one of my faves in Newmarket maybe even more than the Keg because of the service!  Anytime there's been an issue they resolve it quickly.  Once I didn't have my drink for a while I waited maybe 5-10 mins so when they brought it out it was comp'd.  Once my crab legs took a long time I didn't even notice because they took care of everything from apps to more drinks!    This is how you run a business you catch the mistake before the customer or you rectify it before the customer has to say anything and yes I am finicky and if I had waited 10mins for a glass of wine you bet I'm going to say something but i never had to and that's why this is my fave place!   And the food is pretty good too :)!  But service means everything to me!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere = Good Food = Good Service = a bit slow Price = Way too pricey for the portions that you get.  Had started + main + desert and still hungry."}
{"text":"The ambiance is nice, spacious and comfortable. We have a 1 year old and they're very accommodating for kids. I see a lot of other parents bringing kids. The music is a good volume.  The food I find is a bit hit or miss. Some of the dishes are really good and some...well not that good at all. We particularly enjoy the seafood pasta, spinach dip is good and the fist tacos. Had the squash ravioli once and it was nice but the portion quite small and it was a lot spicer than expected. Their burgers and fries are really nice. Do not get the ginger beef, the entire dish has a weird taste and way too much sweet brown sauce.  Service is fine, the servers are pretty attentive to your needs. Price is on par with other similar chains. I do like Milestones more than Moxie's, Jack Astor's, and Joey's."}
{"text":"This review is a couple days late. Still writing it though. ? am not going to comment on food; this is about the service. Not a pleasant experience.  I made reservations the day before, for my grandparents and myself.  Once I arrived, I asked to be seated next to the window, air quality was not so great on the patio for my grandparents.  Service was very, very slow. I had to get up a few times to get some attention.  1. For water 2. To order 3. For clean utensils 4. Ketchup for grandpa's fries 5. For the bill, 6. Second attempt for bill  ?f we had decent service, we would have stayed for dessert and coffee.  No one checked on us during our meal, to see if we needed anything. Not 1 refill on our drinks.  ? get your busy, dinner hour.  Then prepare your staff for the load. The place was packed with younger people, and servers running after them and their drinks.  How about some courtesy? Can't believe ? still gave a tip, felt pressured to do so.   Zero stars for the whole experience.   UPDATE*******  Milestones management reached out to me and tried to make it up. Very nice of them."}
{"text":"We went to milestones at Heartland in February 2016 and the food was so good we were really happy with the experience so we went again yesterday (March 2016) and to our disappointment we found out they got rid of their original menu and had a whole new menu. So if you are hoping to get any of your favourite dishes they aren't there anymore. We weren't happy about it but we decided to give the new menu a try. We ordered their foccocia cheese bread (like garlic bread) and it was the worst bread we have ever had. You just chew and chew and it doesn't go down at all. We also had the crusted tilapia which was still there from the original menu but only for a limited time and it was nothing compared to the one we got before. This is the worst restaurant food we have ever had, especially at these prices. The staff were nice about it and tried to be helpful and waived the bill. This was going to be one of our go to places, but not anymore. I checked the milestones website after our meal and no where on the site does it say the menu is completely changed. They still had their old menu online. We also made reservations so it would have been nice if the hostess had let us know that their menu was completely different. I am not one who usually writes reviews unless I feel very strongly about it."}
{"text":"Food is less than average quality at best.  It's a large place, but it was empty when we came in for brunch. I got the prime rib eggs benny, which was just OK. The beef was a bit too chewy for my liking and didn't really have much flavor. The home fries it came with were also pretty bland and the hollandaise was way too mustardy for me. I'm a big eggs benny fan but this place definitely doesn't cut it.  Service was also notably slow, which was strange considering that there weren't a lot of diners in the first place."}
{"text":"great location and decor. Good service EXCEPT almost being attacked by the server. Never saw someone get so angry over one question and asking for reasonably timely service.  We paid the bill and left, for some reason only our server could take the credit card , I felt coerced into leaving a tip lest getting the server more upset. The food was normal chain food and the drinks were sweet."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch at milestones. Wow we were impressed. I had the prime rib eggs Benny with mushrooms and garlic horseradish sauce. It was one of the best egg Benny's I have ever had. Other members in the party had the breakfast tacos with scrambled eggs bacon black beans tomato and avocado salsa and cheese. They thought it was delicious. Also tried the chicken waffles and thought it was outstanding with bacon gravy.  We will go back for sure as the meal was great. Service was good too sema I think her name was."}
{"text":"The restaurant buzzer is a symbol of hope. It is a promise that, although there is not currently a table available, there will be. That chosen-one jackpot moment of jubilant buzzing and flashing will soon be upon you...or will it?  I went to Milestones on a sunny day to enjoy a drink on the patio with a friend.  We were told that there would be a 25 minute wait, but that we were welcome to grab a drink in their lounge area in the mean time. Equipped with our buzzer, we sat at the bar and waited to be served. It took ages before a waitress deemed us worthy of her attention, at which point she brought us menus and forgot all about us. She finally took our extremely difficult order of two glasses of wine. My gaze periodically flitted over to our dormant buzzer and I silently willed it to spring to life - but it remained still. The waitress set two big empty glasses before us and we rejoiced that although we were still not in our desired locale, at LEAST we would have a beverage to tide us over. To our dismay, those surly oversized glasses just sat there tormenting us along with our lame buzzer. We started to wonder if this was all some sort of cruel joke when, more than 10 minutes after the glasses were presented to us, they were finally given purpose! I know wine is really tricky to supply, it's not as if it's just sitting around in bottles waiting to be poured...  We enjoyed our wine and chatted for awhile. Hope of the buzzer sounding faded the closer we got to the bottom of our glasses. We were there for an hour and a half, and our table never became available.  As we were paying the bill, our waitress said, \"We could seat you on the patio now if you'd like.\" Ya, no. Thanks - we're good."}
{"text":"I usually get the Kobe beef sliders, some fancy cocktails and the California salad. Service at this location is friendlier than the Dundas Square location. Brunch is surprisingly good for a chain restaurant. I'm never disappointed with Milestones. Even for a chain they never fail to please. Never a bad experience. Usual experience at Milestone for me ranks 3 to 5 depending on what's going on, the service, etc.  They serve Mighty Leaf tea too, which is good to know if you're a tea snob."}
{"text":"Milestones is my go-to chain restaurant if I have to do chains. If I'm stuck in the burbs or something, I go to Milestones. This location is nice. Service is average but friendly, sometimes pretentious (hence the 4 stars). Like, once the bartender got offended and defensive because I asked him to make my drink a certain way and said something like \"I know how to do my job.\"  The drinks are delicious. I love the Kobe beef sliders and the California salad.  Brunch is delicious too, though I've never had it at this location."}
{"text":"Great drinks as usual, great appetizers. Service was friendly and attentive to my food allergy, which some places aren't. I appreciated that. Milestones is a good default chain restaurant if you were to do chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and sat at the patio.  Ordered the spicy chicken wings and a Stella - perfect food for the nice patio weather but nothing out if the ordinary for this place.  Service was ok - server was pregnant so I don't want to knock them for not checking up on my table that much although she was very kind and friendly.  The place looked better than the Kelsey's beside it so if I was in the area again I would probably still head to Milestones."}
{"text":"Wow, haven't been to Milestone's in years as the food quality was on a steady decline with the service equally awful. My birthday gift card brought me back to another horrendous Cara restaurant. We ordered steak and frites and a rustic chicken sandwich. The steak was completely overdone with negative AAA steak drowned in an insipid gravy served with soggy French fries dressed up with some truffle Parmesan? The rustic chicken sandwich was edible but again with the soggy French fries, maybe some people like it? No one bothered to check in on us or ask us how we were doing/enjoying/not enjoying our meal. It's unfortunate that Canucks love Cara restaurants as it stifles competition and every mall looks the same."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 stars.  It still amazes me that I have visited a bunch of places and never got around to doing reviews for them. This Milestones restaurant is one of them.  I do have a good reason for missing this review until now. When I was last there, it was a few hours before I took a plane off to Winnipeg for my vacation. It was in July 2016.  I parked and walked in. I remember waiting a bit before I got seated at a comfortable booth. It's got a darker atmosphere inside, so you may need to adjust our eyes for a brief period.  I ordered the following: - The captain's coconut calamari - Beef bolognese - Chocolate ganache cake with caramel sauce  The captain's coconut calamari was yummy. I love coconut and calamari. They worked well together.  I had the beef bolognese, which had linguine noodles. The dish looked small at first, but it was filling. I liked it.  For dessert, I got the chocolate ganache cake. It came with caramel sauce. I loved the cake. I have never been a huge caramel person, so I left most of it there.  It was a decent late lunch before boarding a flight. I would come back here again and try more items on the menu.  (216)"}
{"text":"Upscale dining in a Mall parking lot!  Prices are OK but don't expect cheap food!  Excellent service with a smile and attractive surroundings including the waitstaff!  Varied menu and a nice Wine/drink list too!  I will be back for more good food and nice service!"}
{"text":"We went out for dinner after my sewing class today because we were hungry. Man, what a bad decision. I don't know if it's me & my sensitive stomach. But we tried a couple of dishes from the Top Chef Canada inspired menu. We had the BBQ Pork Croquettes as appetizers, then I had the Steak & Frites entree & hubby had the American Burger. Long story short, I got very, very sick & lost everything in my stomach. I'll spare you guys the gory details. LOL.   Needless to say, I think we'd better avoid this place for a while. Their quality of food is really crappy sometimes.The steak part of the entree is supposed to prime rib. But the Milestone's prime rib tastes horrible & nothing like The Keg prime rib which is the most delicious I've ever tasted. It's too bad the food sucked, but our waitress was really nice & friendly. And kept refilling our drinks. No Wi-fi though at the restaurant. :-(  Update: I figured out what upset my stomach so much. It was the appetizers we had, the BBQ Pork Croquettes. I think the meat they used may have been old, or not cooked properly."}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Downtown Markham theater quite often but never realize that Milestones was located here.  It's really nice to not have to go into the city and have that downtown feel to it!  Came here last night for dinner for the first time.   It was a very nice place with a chic decor.  It even had a nice patio that looks very comfortable.  Foodwise, the portions were big, nicely presented, taste was delicious and lots of variety on the menu for everyone.  We had the  Portobello mushroom chicken, California burger and Beef Bolognese.  The prices here are also very reasonable average $20 for main course.  This will definitely be a place that we will be coming back."}
{"text":"The location is the best value. Service was excellent. Quick, patient and freindly. Must admit it was really very good. Food was so so. Had the feelimg that my steak was already before I arrived. Somehow poor. Blackberry coctail and Drunken donats were very good.  Overall a clear \"Yes, it was good\""}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch to celebrate a birthday, 3 of us ordered the Traditional Eggs Benny's. All of our poached eggs including the hollandaise sauce were cold!! We let the waitress know & she said another table complained of the same thing & she told us she would advise the kitchen staff. However nothing worse than paying full price for cold food! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax, staff was friendly and relaxed. food was good. Only wish the appitizers were a little higher quality but the main course was great!"}
{"text":"Just had amazing appetizers, calamari rings and artichoke and spinach dip. Followed by their signature California salad. Everything was absolutely delicious, a real treat."}
{"text":"I only had the the appetizers there and they were okay but nothing really to write home about. The dip was good but they had chips instead of bread and for this type of place, I expected more. They were pleasant but seemed thrifty overall and not all that friendly but that might be because I was in a large group."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down and chat with friends. Environment is very relaxing and nicely dim. However the food is nothing special. Great service though."}
{"text":"Surprised at the negative reviews here. I ate at  the Dundas location for the first time this weekend and I was happy with both the food and the service. We sat in the 'Atrium' section which was actually more open and more quiet than the dining room section and were seated within seconds. We ordered the 'sirloin' steak simply grilled, and it came with a side order of vegetables and a garlic mash. The steak was very tasty and cooked exactly the way we ordered it. Our server was friendly outgoing and surprisingly did not try to up sell us on any additional menu items. Pricing was what I expected for this restaurant and location and we had a very enjoyable meal.  If you do go to this location ask to sit in the atrium, its actually nicer than the dining room!"}
{"text":"Those who have read my reviews knows I'm all about service, even when the food is amazing but if the service sucks, it ruins the meal that much more. So here goes the story of this dinner; would have given half a star higher if the girl on the phone and our waiter took the time to actually remember what I said - THREE times.  Food was okay but not amazinggg; if you come on Thursdays their apps are half off, which is a great deal. Their bellinis are also very popular. Service 'was' okay until...  So their patio isn't that big but it's a good size. Once it gets dark the lights come on so it's kinda pretty. Because they are located right beside the road, the noise level does get a bit up there, but not so loud that it covers your convo. Their indoor seating is actually quite spacious, and they have a separate bar area on the right hand side. Once it gets around dinner time though, it does get very busy. So, either try to book a table or come early.  The calamaris are lighter in flavour, but imo it was still okay as the mild coconut flavour complimented it well; the sauce went well with it also. Another app to try is their artichoke dip; veryyyy cheesy if you're a cheese fan; it also comes in a general serving of tortilla chips, perfect for sharing. The portobello chicken was surprisingly tender, but just a bit on the salty side. Their miso cod is worth a try; fish was tender and not dry and the rice was well flavoured. If you're wondering about the beef bolognese, you're probably better off making it at home... it wasn't bad but there's nothing too special about it, even though they say it's their 'signature house-made sauce'.   So... the service. Came here for a friend's birthday so I specifically asked the girl on the phone whether she put a note into the system to have their cake brought out when I ask for the bill. She kindly assured me that it is in the system and our server will bring it out when we ask for the bill... for some reason there was this part of me that said nope, not gonna happen. When the time came for the bill, I asked my waiter not once, not twice, but THREE times 'where's the cake... I need to leave soon'. It was super awkward to keep waiting for it, without having to ruin the surprise. At one point, the bill was paid so we thought it was coming, but the cake still didn't arrive... so I had to 'pretend' to go to the bathroom meanwhile to hunt down the waiter and ask him where the heck is that cake. After a total of 3 attempts to get the cake to our table, he finally came out with it all decked out with giant sparklers and stuff. Pretty and good as it was (it was I believe the white chocolate cake from their dessert menu), a customer shouldn't have to physically hunt down their server in search of something, or to ask for it multiple times.  I wanted to give this place a better review, especially when one of the kids at our table wanted different bellini toppers to play with and our server actually took the time to bring them to us, but damn, getting that cake was just so frustrating.  All in all, I would come back to this place for drinks, food maybe (on Thursdays), definitely not for any celebrations as it clearly requires too much effort."}
{"text":"Yelpers know that I love burgers. And Milestone has awesome four cheese burger. Not one, but four cheeses. While the circle fries look fancy, you can't afford not to substitute it with yam fries. It's just sooo delicious.   For $ 15, you'll get a decent unhealthy meal. Pop is refillable so drink and pee as you wish. I tried the soup on Sunday and oh man, it was awesome. Sorry I forgot the name but they change it everyday anyways.   They have a gimmick nightly (ladies night etc).  The atmosphere inside is cool. Booths and window seats are the best seats in the house. There's a bar on the first floor - it's a two-story restaurant. It's close to North Civic Center, North York library and just outside North York subway. Need to say it's convenient?   Limited parking on Yonge Street. Pay your parking - parking officers are on duty.  My only complaint is the service. It is so slooow. Not efficient at all. Will I come back, I will. That four-cheese burger is worth coming back for.   A good tip? Bring patience, service is slow."}
{"text":"My parents had just picked me up from the airport after being away for a week and I asked them to bring me somewhere comfortable and familiar. This is where we ended up.  Usually I would say that attempting this kind of restaurant on a Friday is just nuts, and I was proven right that night. The place was entirely packed. Which is great considering the old neighbouring movie theatre is gone.   We were seated quickly enough but were not approached by a server for at least 15 minutes. Growing slightly frustrated we flagged down the nearest person who glanced our direction and got Jennifer. She quickly took our order and promised to find out who our server was supposed to be. Jennifer returned with our drinks, stated she would cover for our server and continued to serve us the remainder of the night. Later we found out that she ended up staying later than she was supposed to in order to help out the team. As someone who used to work in a service industry job, I really appreciated her commitment to serving the customers when needed. Most others would have punched out and left when their shift was done. Bravo to Jennifer!  Food wise, I had the seafood pasta. It was decent, a little on the oily side but flavourful enough. My dad had the prime rib which he seemed to really like. I would return to Milestones in the future. Though likely not on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Friendly but slow service.  Rubbish food.  The best thing to say about this place is they were very very accommodating since we had a service dog with us and sometimes places are weird about that even though they shouldn't be.  I had the Southern fried chicken sandwich and it was beyond bland.  The fries were also lackluster. I don't understand the appeal of this place."}
{"text":"Food was almost 40mins to arrive.  It was cold and had egg shells mixed it.  The manager sighed and complained verbally.  Will never come again.    I would have just left but we had a movie to go to and didn't have time to go elsewhere.    Bad bad bad"}
{"text":"Terrible servixe. Came here for Sat brunch and only 1 server in the lounge (upstairs is closed). The server will disappear. They did not offer jam or peanut butter or butter for toast. I asked for butter and they gave me melted butter. Food was too salty and the prime rib benny was very dry."}
{"text":"Friendly bartender! He took his time to tell us were should we go in Toronto as tourists fir a weekend! It was very helpful!"}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day dinner. Food was good, but the portions are small. Paid $27 for a tiny steak. Also ordered coconut calamari, and was given a tiny portion in comparison to past visits. Noticed that the prices are higher, and you get less of a serving than last time I was there. Not gonna waste my time going back."}
{"text":"Courteous staff and quick service. I had the fish and chips, was good but the portions were small for the price."}
{"text":"Comparing to other chain restaurants and other Milestones,  this ones scores really low for the food and service.  Painfully arrogant service coupled with almost inedible food, this place made me want to leave part way through dinner.  Our waitress took nearly 25 minutes to bring the menu before disappearing again for another 20 minutes.  We even asked another waiter to place the order but he said he'd try to find the original waitress.  When she resurfaced, we were able to tell her what we want but it was clear that she had a very hard time capturing the mains with our preferred sides or appetizer.  She couldn't repeat back the order.  This should have been the point where we just walked out.  When the food was served, some of us were given with the wrong sides.  We flagged down the waitress and told her what was wrong. Instead of apologizing, she told us that we were wrong!  Then she told us to just switch the mains on the plates to different sides even though no one wanted the rice. Finally she said she'd get them correct but not before rolling her eyes at us.  Another 20 minutes go by and when the food arrives, they're with the correct sides but the mains are cold.  The burger bun is damp and soggy from the vegetables and the salad had a ridiculous amount of dressing on it.  The fish is over salted and the fries are so limp.  Just save yourself the headache and go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Good enough. We stopped by for brunch on Sunday and options are limited but flavour is good. Service took long and although we are able to substitute items, they forgot my bread for a long time. My eggs are cold and no bread in sight. The tables are set in a way where it is difficult to wave someone down and the girls hang out in the kitchen in between so can't find one to take a message."}
{"text":"This place looks and feels like a fake Cheesecake Factory with no Cheesecakes and a menu that unlike the cheesecake factory, does not have many reliable choices. The Pizza is actually pretty decent, but I would not recommend much else. The drinks are over-priced and not nearly as special as they may appear. Decent location for groups; otherwise, this is just one in the many traps in the Richmond St. area."}
{"text":"While I like this Milestone's more than the John&Richmond location thanks to a neat first floor bar and cool bartenders, it still gives me the same though: \"dude, there's got to be a better place to eat/chill/drink nearby, this is a busy spot\". Hence, this is yet another, \"we don't know what we want, so let's just choose the most standard spot nearby\" kind of spot, and frankly Toronto has a few too many. If you want more details, check the reviews for the other Milestone's location, it is almost a clone."}
{"text":"1 star because it's not the worst experience possible 1 star for a large patio with an awesome view 0.5 star for the convenient location!  I'd really rather not drag this review into a huge rant, but I've had pretty poor service whenever I have been dragged here. Most recently it took about a good hour and fifteen minutes between asking for our bill and getting out of Milestone's!   On top of that the beer list is not impressive at all, and you will get some funny looks from the waitresses if you ask for something other than Heineken or Bud! In fact I would say this is the first and only bar where I have been asked \"what's an IPA?\" by the waitstaff!   The food is actually ok, but there's nothing particularly striking about it other than that it sometimes takes heck of a long time to get out! Overall I would say this Milestone's is a straightforward place to meet up or take out of town guests who insist on seeing T.O's version of Times Square."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday afternoon. Not too busy. First no one approached us at the door and we had to walk around looking for assistance. I asked the guy we finally spoke to whether we would be served at our tables because the place obviously had no wait_staff walking around, he gave me a really sarcastic \"yes\" before we were finally seated by a friendlier waitress.  Ordered garlic cheese bread which was good. Steak was not well seasoned and medium instead or medium well done as asked. Worst part was the hour wait just to get served. My GF who had steak frites echoed my sentiments as well. Not worth the price. I won't return or recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely abysmal. The only redeeming part of the experience was that the bill was taken care of by the manager. Between the two servers who kept coming to our table to ask if the other one had taken our order, and the awful food, not to mention how condescending the manager was... my family and I will certainly never go to Milestone's again.  I used to frequent this location every once in a while before they changed head chefs and although not my favourite restaurant, it was quite good and the food always came out hot and the service was decent. I noticed immediately upon reaching the door that the location seemed fairly busy, but for a Wednesday night, it was not unusual. I stopped by last night with a colleague (whose native language is not English and I'll get to why that is important in a second) and we started the night off with drinks. Our drinks and dinner orders were taken by a second server who returned with both drinks promptly, and one side of my glass was coated in dried sugar. I didn't think too much of it and wiped the glass down as much as I could, assuming that the sugar had spilled over from the drink and dried on the outside of the glass. 15 minutes later our original server came back to ask us if someone had taken our order and we notified her that our order was already taken by another server. Another 10 minutes go by and the appetizer finally comes out with the second server. We ordered a chimichurri garlic bread and the bread was not toasted all the way through. The cheese at the very top was nice and golden, but the loaf of bread beneath it (a long, plain bread roll) was only slightly warmed.  My guest and I finished the bread and then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for our entrees (two salads, one without nuts, and one soup) to come out. At no point during this now 45 minute wait for entrees did anyone come by to replenish water or take away our empty drink glasses. The original server came back to confirm our entree order and to apologize but our meals had been taken to another table. Upon confirming our order, she looked relieved and said that they were actually ready. A third server came out with the salads and soup. Even on first glance, I knew that the salad in front of me was wilted and not fresh. The strawberries were pure mush, with a texture reminiscent of thawed frozen berries, and the dressing was bland. The onions were soft and had no crisp at all when a fork went through them. The leaves were completely wilted and the salad was warm. It tasted like the salad had been marinading in the dressing in slightly warm conditions and it tasted as such. My guest's salad was equally not fresh. Her seafood was grilled but not hot, and the avocado was brown. I flagged down a server and she took one look at my salad and noted that the salad was indeed wilted and that she would bring us fresh plates. I proceeded to finish my seasonal mushroom soup (pretty good!) and at this point had 3 empty glasses and a dirty plate on the table with us while we waited for the soups.  Who I assume is a manager came out to apologize for the inconvenience, and proceeded to make an underhanded comment to my guest about the \"two or three pieces of wilted leaves\" she found in her plate. My guest tried to explain to him that the salad was not appetizing and upon hearing her accent, his tone completely changed and he began to speak to her very slowly and in simple words, stretching out the syllables, as if speaking to a child. I was completely taken aback and pointed out that it was unnecessary to be condescending and that we would be happy to take a fresh plate of salad each and pay for a fresh plate. This man left and yet ANOTHER manager (now the kitchen manager I believe) came out to apologize as well, and reiterated that he was truly sorry if we \"found two or three pieces of wilted leaves.\" He promised to bring out fresh salads. He came back with the California salad, now with nuts in it. It appeared to be in almost exactly the same condition as the first, and the plating was awfully unappetizing and obviously put together quickly. At this point we are ready to leave, and notify our original server that we are ready to pay for the drinks and appetizer and leave. She tells us that the bill has been covered and we request that she cancel the salads and we left.  All around an awful experience, but hands down, the behaviour of the two managerial staff members was the worst part. The food came a close second."}
{"text":"I try to avoid chains but stepped in for drinks with a friend.   The service was great for a busy Friday night and we were seated on the patio relatively quickly. They have a summer special menu with the drinks on it being $5. My friend ordered their original Bellini off this menu but she didn't enjoy it, which is the only reason why I am giving this review four stars.  I got a Moscow Mule, which was served in a classic copper mug (as it should be), and it was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised with the balance of sweet, spicy, and sour as I've had some bad Moscow Mules in my time. Perfect way to end the work week and kick off the weekend.   We didn't order any food so no review on the food here, but if it's as good as my Moscow Mule, this Milestones is definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"Looks like Milestones has a new menu. It's been a while since i've eaten here, but this location is super convenient -as its connected to Market Mall so great for date night! Good ambiance & food is quite reliable! Nothing too fancy, but they have big salads which leave u satisfied not hungry for more! Gluten & vegetarian options too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink, and a couple of apps. Food was very nice, but the Bartender was outstanding! You could see he, and all of the staff had a \"sense of urgency\", and cared about what they were doing. Nice change from the place next door. Kudos to the management team."}
{"text":"I adore Milestone's. I don't think I've been to one I didn't like. This location in particular, I'm especially in love with during the summer, because their patio opens up on the balcony and you get to people watch from above. What better place to watch people at dundas square intersection than from above? AWESOME!  Generally, Milestone's is my go-to place for brunch. Love their brunch menu! I highly recommend the prime rib hash with sunshine mimosa...what a great way to begin a lazy weekend day =)  One of my favourite things to eat here is the Caesar salad. They do such a great job with the slow-roasted garlic paste mixed in with the house caesar dressing. I always feel like I can't have enough salad.  Also highly recommended is their California grilled chicken breast burger (Avacado salsa, double bacon). Delicious!  Tonight, us four girls came for their Monday Girl's night out menu. Four bellinis and four appetizers for $40. So cheap! The sweet potato fries were worth it!  I heart Milestone's!"}
{"text":"Our bartender Cass totally screwed us over!! Three American women, just new in town for a long weekend. Loved the look of the patio and view. Didn't have time for dinner, but checking place out so went to bar for a drink. Bar tab $32 CAN, hadn't converted any US dollars so asked if we could pay in cash that way. Hadn't looked up conversion rate so gave bartender $40US and he said he'd figure out for us. Told us us we still owed $7.50!! Left him another $20 US to cover plus great tip. I'LL SAY!! $50 US is over $60 CAN for a $32 CAN tab. @$!√ó@&* What a dick!!"}
{"text":"I usually love going to Milestone's.  It can be a bit overpriced for the quality of the food but they have a great lunch special and I love the big booths and tables.  However, the last time I went, I went with my boyfriend and we had terrible service, so bad that we walked out before our meal was served.  Our waiter took our order and then didn't bring us our drinks for almost half an hour, opting instead to wait on every person around us that came in, and serve them their drinks, it was like they were trying to get us to leave.  Every time we tried to get his attention, he would swoop past us as if we didn't exist.  I'm fairly certain it's because we were in casual wear, flip flops and carrying backpacks.  Usually when I go, it's after work and  I'm dressed up and I get very good service.  So a word of advice: if you want to be treated well, make sure you're not wearing ripped jeans and your hair's brushed!  I found it pretty disgusting and I won't be returning."}
{"text":"When we walked in around 8:00pm, there were a lot of seats. We didn't mind where we sat so they showed us to the bar side with high chairs and booths. Our friendly was very friendly, and while nothing was quick, it was expected. There was a summer deal going on for $5 apps and we got a chorizo fries and popcorn chili shrimp - both were really tasty! We had siracha buffalo wings and pesto chicken alfredo and again thumbs up.   The only thing that's making this a 4 star rather than a 5 is that on average, Milestones has a slower output of food that some other chain restaurants and if there were any more people there I'm sure it would have been much slower.   Fun vibe on the bar side!"}
{"text":"I would give these place 0 stars if I could. I've been here quite a few times since it is one of the closest restaurants to Unionville GO and it takes forever to get seated. The servers would look at us, just look away and ignore us almost every time I've been there and we would have to flag down the servers just to get seated. They are also not very friendly and don't seem very genuine. I've been to many other Milestones branches in the GTA and the service would always be amazing, but not at this location. This is by far the worst Milestones branch I've ever been to."}
{"text":"A nice spot and a great restaurant.  We went on a Wednesday night so it was super quiet. Lots of tables and we were seated right away.  Our server was very attentive to our table and even though we were very indecisive about our orders he came and checked on us often.  The food was super delightful! We had the spinach dip and it came with red tortilla chips and even sides of sour cream and bruschetta- a super great touch.  Once we ordered the food came out fast and hot.  Parking we had parked in the Telus Convention centre parkade- there are quite a few parkades around and the cost was $6.00."}
{"text":"I was really surprised at how good this new Milestones at Enterprise Blvd is after having tried the chain at its Yonge (North York), and Hwy 7 & Warden locations every few years. I've always ranked this restaurant as above Pickle Barrel, but below The Keg.   Hubby and I had a fantastic date night on Wednesday: The restaurant was warm and not drafty, the decor was pretty nice (wall of wine bottles on one side, open kitchen window on the other), and the noise was not bad because it didn't bounce off the walls and chairs.   We ordered the 10oz prime rib with mash, grilled Mediterranean chicken over kale/spinach/chickpeas, and the donuts dessert to share. The chicken was great, and I think I liked it more than the prime rib, surprisingly.  The prime rib was perfect medium rare, very standard fare, the grilled veggies were nicely seasoned, and it came with sour cream horseradish and gravy.  We really had no more room for dessert, but we enjoyed the mains so much we wanted to know if the dessert would cinch it (and it did).  Service was very pleasant, though a little green possibly because the restaurant just opened and staff may be new.    Only humorous thing about the night was when they tried to recommend their $5 off wine, but it was a very general \"we've got cheap wine\" kind of sales pitch without going into what the wine was (even if it's just the house wine, tell me something about it to make it sound fancy). We told our server that the food was really good and better than expected, she informed us that the restaurant had updated its menu...so we think it's possible they streamlined the offerings and improved the food quality and taste.  They have a Scene points promotion too, but it's only 20 scene points...that would take forever to get to 1 free movie ticket.   I have no issues with the parking offered, there is underground parking too, but I guess lots of people are not used to parking underground or they don't feel like walking a few extra meters to and from their car.  I think the walk would do most people good after eating so much food :)"}
{"text":"This place used to be so much better. Maybe their lunch service is different from dinner. I used to come with friends a lot on weekends mainly for the dips and their famous bellinis. I liked both their downstairs lounge and their upstairs big tables and the cute ceiling lights. You can see Yonge street if you sit by the window. Unfortunately, my last visit here for lunch wasn't as good as what I experienced before. The salad I ordered was not fresh at all and my steak was dry! The customer service is very good and they're all friendly. I just wish they would pay more attention to the actual reason people come here, which is the food!"}
{"text":"This place was a great date night spot. There was no wait time when we arrived on a Sunday evening.  Julia was a server. She was friendly and gave us great service. We ordered the artichoke and spinach dip for a starter and it was by far the best dip I've had at a restaurant.  For dinner, my date and I both had steaks which were cooked to perfection with mash and veggies on the side.  Everything was great overall and will definitely be back in the near future.  Definitely prefer milestones to the keg   Food 5/5 Service 5/5  Price:Quality 5/5   Overall experience 5/5"}
{"text":"There is something about Milestones that has changed. I feel as though their menu remained the same but their flavours have changed. I like the location and the atmosphere but I wasn't awed by the tastes. Our dishes were good and tasty but not what I remembered it to be like a few years back."}
{"text":"The tuna tacos are nice... And the location is good as well, the ambience is not too bad... I think is a good place to have lunch or a drink after working."}
{"text":"The Mini Peruvian Burritos with lomo saltado were savoury and tasty with the first few bites but the saltiness became unbearable. I could hardly finish them. The tortillas were definitely Old El Paso or equivalent, which was a major let down. If you have a bunch of dishes that come with tortillas, make your own or buy a high quality brand.  The Ahi Tuna Tacos (3x) were topped with a cilantro lime slaw that had a very intense citrusy bite. So much so that it took away from the taste of the gorgeous pieces of tuna. What  a waste!  The Sangria tasted like Minute Maid Fruit Punch. It was loaded with ice and pieces of fruit. The beer selection was miserable.   Overall, I found the experience to be very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've dined here few times since I was at the mall and everything else was full, and it wasn't anything special. I heard that it's been closed for some time now which is not surprising. The place was nice and spacious, but service and quality of food wasn't great, which is odd as Milestones is usually a good restaurant, at other locations at least"}
{"text":"This location is nice compared to some other ones within the Milestones franchise. It's always empty, which is good if you like a quite place, but it's also nice to se some crowd some times. Food quality is in line with other locations, but the service is a hit and miss here. I've been here few times and service is sometimes over the top, and very disappointing on other visits.  The bar area is pretty cool, with butcher slab tables with high stools, big screen TVs, new shiny beer tabs..  My most favourite dish in there (or was at least as I think it just got discontinued) is the Harrisa chicken, where you got grilled chicken with moroccan couscous and Harrisa sauce, pretty good! Another favourite appetizer is the asian chicken bites.  All in all, a decent restaurant, good food, okay service."}
{"text":"When I walked in to the restaurant, just based on the location and ambiance I would have given it 5 stars! but there are so many other factors that must be considered when rating a restaurant. The service - was pretty bad. We probably did was much work as our waiter when it came to setting our table, and clearing it up. The drinks were mediocre at best. For such a nice looking bar and drink menu, you would expect the drinks to taste much better. The food, was the best part. I have no complaints there :) We ordered a couple different items, the spinach dip, the veg burger, the thai chicken wrap - and all the dishes were great! Definitely a place worth checking out. Hopefully you'll have better luck with the server, and drinks"}
{"text":"Not the Nicest Milestone I've been to, I find it too Dark and s bit dated, they need to do some Renovations to create a better ambience."}
{"text":"Ok I have allowed 3 days to calm down and I have counted to 10 multiple times over those days. Way to go Milestones for ruining our New Years Eve. We arrived 15 minutes ahead of our reservation for their New Years Eve $50 prix fixe dinner. Ordered wine and the waiter immediately said \"oh we may be out of that; let me go check\"  and he rushed off before I could say \"well here is my 2nd choice\".  We then moved into what would be a common mode over the next 70 minutes,,,sit and wait. Eight minutes later he returned with confirmation that they were out of choice 1. Ten minutes later we had choice # 2 and we place our orders for Apps and Entrees.  And then we waited. Almost 20 minutes for Apps. One of which (Thai chickens bits) was lukewarm. Commented to waiter.  App dishes removed and then we waited. ....15 minutes. \"Would you like me to top up your wine?\" was the one visit from our waiter \"No, I am waiting for the entrees if they ever show up\" Entrees show up....my steak is lukewarm; the mashed spuds are lukewarm.  \"I can take it back and have it fixed and warmed up\" says our waiter \"And cook it beyond what it should have been in the first place?\" I cross my cutlery and asked  for it to be packaged up for take out. Now for dessert....we both ordered the cheesecake. We got one cheesecake and one chocolate ganache. I AM NOW STEAMING! In the end both meals were comped and we only paid for wine plus a tip that my S/O insisted upon.   Crappy service like this is inexcusable.  I don't buy that it was caused by the New Years Eve rush...it was an all reservation night so  you knew ahead of time how many were coming....you staff up and you have the processes in place so that food expeditors move the dishes out as soon as they are plated. Milestones, I will wait until all of the other Etobicoke eateries run out of food before I ever return to your place. You should be ashamed of your service."}
{"text":"This comment does not relate to the regular Milestones menu/dish! Not a first-time eater at Milestones, but it was a big mistake to go out of the ordinary to try the Trio for 2 - Inspired by Iron Chef menu. I'm never a picky eater but it was really difficult for me to say anything or even smile back when the hot waiter asked me how my meal was. I should have being honest, I didn't and I still regret it. We had 3 girls and the bill turned out to be over $120 --- $120 for total disappointment. This meal actually made me wondered, if there's a similarity between award-winning movies and award-winning food. Because either of them, I just don't get it!!!  Anyone being curious? Please try it. I really wonder if anyone would like this meal and think its worth $60!!! (We also ordered one salad and two Martinis off the regular menu which were all fine, but my unsatisfied stomach and anger just won't allow me to think about anything positive about this meal.)"}
{"text":"Although I didn't really enjoy my burger last night, I just enjoyed myself over all.. Milestones is easily one of my favorite franchise restaurants. The menu is simple and never dissapoints me. I should of stuck with my usual, but I felt daring yesterday and tried the Mayan burger.. it was okay but I like a simple burger and I found it to over the top but the food and atmosphere is decent as always."}
{"text":"Great service and fair food.  I entered the restaurant and was immediately greeted and welcomed by the hostess who sat me at my table. My server was very friendly and helpful. She would cater to all my needs  with intent and get it done as soon as possible!   The ambiance was very unique. There was a wine wall and had a classier feel to it. It was not too bright nor too dark and is a good place for a date.  I had an 8 oz top sirloin seasoned and grilled to perfection. Served with seasonal vegetable roasted garlic mashed potatoes. I asked for it medium rare. It was perfect with a red middle but the steak tasted dry and was not as juicy in the middle. I had the steak with a glass of red wine which went well with the steak. The mashed potatoes were good but got boring halfway into it.   The price for the portion is not worth the bang for the buck. It was still a good experience and the service was great! I would definitely come back for occasions!"}
{"text":"Very polite and friendly staff, but absolutely no options for vegans. All the pastas are egg-based, buns are egg-based, and everything else contains dairy. All of the salads have cheese. What do these people think vegans eat?  For the vegan options, my family was given:  1. A soy patty (barely-cooked) on white toast with 4 pieces of green beans.   2. Rice noodles with spicy tomato sauce, barely cooked and cold as well.   They should be charged criminally for what they gave, especially given the fact that they charged 80.00 for this ordeal. 80.00."}
{"text":"I just want to lounge in the patio area...  One of the nicest patio in the area and it was heated toasty warm even on a beautiful early summer night! The cushions so comfy, I can stay out there for awhile. The only thing now is the landscaping that needed to be done as it is quite dusty now.  The bar area has 4 huge TV for game time. I enjoyed watching Game 7 of the NHL Western Conference on mute. But Milestones is not really a sport bar so I don't really mind.  Service was excellent as our bartender/server was super attentive!  I would definitely be back to have a night cap or a drink. They now has Mad Tom IPA on tap at $6.99 which is quite reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"This new Milestone location is quite nice as it is spacious. We have a slow start with the service as our server did not come and greet us more than 15 minute after the hostess seated us. Service was though quite solid after that.  Love the Roasted Garlic Caesar Salad ($10) with Kale, which was quite interesting. Miso Glazed Cod was divine but Moroccan Lamb Sirloin was bland and rubbery. Highly recommend one of their cocktails: Moscow Mule was well crafted for $9.  Food is decent and with good daily drink special. I do prefer the set up at the other location at Yonge and Hwy 7 better but this is not bad."}
{"text":"Came here on a busy saturday night with our party of 8 and had to wait 20 mins by the bar. The very attentive staff kept us updated all the time as to when our table would be ready.  The food when it arrived pretty quickly was excellent for our group except for me.  I had the mushroom soup and New York Striplion peppercorn steak.(see pic!) Unfortunately the steak which was supposed to be medium rare came well done. I sent it back and the replcement came barely five mins later done more medium than medium rare. I didn't want to make an issue and accepted it as is. It was totally fine and very tasty though.  We finished with the apple crumble which was again excellent.  The wait staff was very attentive, friendly and caring though out our dinner.  For my slight inconvenience, at the time to pay for the dinner, I was told that my steak was comped.  Kudos to the staff for that!  I'll be back.  4.5 stars for the food. 5 stars for the ambiance and staff. ( which are great looking BTW!)"}
{"text":"Places like Milestone's are kind of a necessary evil in this world. The food isn't life-altering, some of the time it's not even good, but then you'll have that relative come into town who's the pickiest eater in the world and you don't know where to take her.  In my situation, I took her to Milestone's. And she STILL couldn't find anything she liked. Cheese pizza (!!!). That's all she liked. But I digress.  Milestone's isn't awful. I generally avoid going to it because it really does nothing for my appetite, but when I get dragged there, I'm not going to cry about it. They've got a menu with enough choices for me to find something that I like. Prices aren't super cheap, but that's to be expected here, and generally when I'm here, someone else is paying.  And in the summer they've got a decent patio that they cram with people who all want to see what's going on outside.  PS: As much as the Bellinis are slushy girl drinks, god are they ever good."}
{"text":"Karen and me had dinner here. We both love the waitress Katherine here, she's so lovely and friendly.  The 8 oz sirloin steak ( medium well) tastes very soft and juicy with black pepper sauce. 26 cad  We had the grilled chicken with  25% off discount since it's milestone's anniversary.   Don't forget to order the peach Bellini for only 5 dollars. Can you image the taste with rum, peach liquor, sparkling wine and peach slash mixed together in the cup? You will like the sweet and summer flavour.   Germany Torte gave us an happy ending since both of us have sweet teeth.   We felt so delighted and filling after this meal. If you crave for steak or bellini, just come over!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for brunch on Sunday and it was fantastic. We all had great meals, and the spinach dip to start was outstanding. All 4 of us really enjoyed our meals and we all had different dishes. Service was slow to start, but he really came around as it seemed like he had to many tables to start."}
{"text":"I always come here for special occasion and their menu never let me down every time I go there. Miami ice tea is the only reason I order a drink besides water. The breakup cup totally made my night because I ordered that for giggles and the waiter made fun of me for that XD"}
{"text":"The service was ok, he was hard to find several times!  But the food was excellent!   I had the warm goat cheese appetizer, with roasted garlic cloves, red pepper jelly and fig jam.  It was outstanding, as it always is!  I had the lamb sirloin for dinner, it was outstanding.   My issue is with the quinoa pilaf.  It had something VERY SPICY IN IT. And, it's not identified/ listed on the menu.  WHO DOES THIS TO A PILAF??  NOT OK."}
{"text":"Shitty ass service. We waited for 20 minutes and we kept trying to call our waitress and she just kept passing by our table. No one even came to ask us if we wanted anything to drink. Worst service ever. If I can give a negative rating, I would."}
{"text":"When my husband and I walked in we were faced with a wait time. We ended up sitting on the lounge side, which didnt seem to matter because both the lounge and dinner side have the same menus and drinks. We started with drinks. I ordered a 9oz glass of Cab Sav(Wolf Blass) 10$ Amazing price! and a Draft Beer 8.00$ Not so bad. The wine came in a suer clean glass which is the first thing I look for and the beer was so fresh. Really tasteful  The place was really crowded, not a single table available..hence the wait time. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip which was clearly had heart put into the mix, and came with plenty of red corn tortilla chips.  Entres were grilled seafood salad $21.00 and the haddock and pom fritz $19.50 . The salad was amazing. fresh and full of seafood and avocados and pure deliciousness , the haddock was done in panko bread crumbs, so crisp and light and the fries were hand cut, light oil, and sea salt seasoned...well worth the 19.50 The servers were really friendly despite the crowded atmosphere and the tons of people. All in all, the place was pumpin, and the food was amazing. We will deffinately be going again! Maybe not during a rush, or maybe during the summer for the patio effect, either way great choice for a not so stuffy fancy dinner."}
{"text":"Price 3/5 - $14 for desert + tea  Service 4/5 - Corporate smile on the face.   Food 3/5 - Nothing different or outstanding. Regular burgers, regular salads  Nothing special or different about this place. Another fast food corporation franchise.  Will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"I was taken here on a date tonight and I was not very impressed.  We got there around 5:30 with out reservations and were seated quickly. The server skipped our table and served another couple that sat down AFTER us. 15 minutes of waiting to order our food we finally were served. The waiter was VERY friendly and always smiling.  We got a grilled chicken cesar salad and a delicious cheeseburger. We also ordered 2 Sour Apple Martinis.  The problem is.. when they brought our drinks.. my glass had a gross- what looked to be like rasberries squished all over half the inside of the glass. It did not even look like it had been in the wash!  I WAS VERY VERY VERY UNHAPPY! For a bartender to miss that was VERY strange..even for the service to not even notice it on the glass. It was VERY noticable!!  I will not be going back again."}
{"text":"The waitress and hostess were very nice, even when they got our order wrong twice. They apologized and sent us the correct order, but by that time the rest of the people in our party were finished eating and we had to wait. Nothing was docked off of our bill either.  My husband ordered the Montreal Stack and they brought him our a stacked burger instead. I asked for the Milestones Trio lunch with garden salad- I specifically said \"no Caesar salad\" when I ordered. So then my lunch came out with a Caesar salad on the side for some reason.   The poblano soup that came with the trio appeared to be curdled.  I think they put lime into a cream based soup and it looked grainy and not very appetizing.   It's a little in the pricey side. ($25-$28 plate for lunch) For the price you pay here, they should at least make sure they get the order right the first time.  The servers were all very nice and apologetic, at least they seemed sincere about the mix-up."}
{"text":"2nd time here for brunch. Ordered chicken waffle, this is the only place I had chicken waffle with a chicken fillet on top of one piece of waffle, very disappointed. Prime rib Benedict, egg is over cooked, prime rib is super dry. 3rd dish we had is omelette, feta cheese and Spanish cooked separately from the egg, not with the egg.  I expect professional server to be working in this type of restaurant, I don't mean she is not nice server, but food came to us without culinary on our table, missing lemon when asked for hot water with lemon. Disappointed!!! My husband cooks better than this!"}
{"text":"I visited last weekend with my boyfriend and I must say we had some pretty awesome and attentive service from our server Austin. We shared the Chopped Salad with grilled chicken (modified to be gluten free) and the Ganache Torte. Upon making a joke that the dessert was far too small, Austin surprised us with a second round on the house. Not good for the waistline but we appreciated the gesture and ate that cake as well. Austin ensured our needs were taken care of. I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews, perhaps I popped in when it wasn't as busy but either way I found the service and food to be on point."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain ... But we were pleasantly  surprised. Good variety on the menu. Well presented food. Reasonably good value. Food was a bit slow to arrive but this is xmas week after all so that was not unexpected."}
{"text":"You know what? I like Milestones. Yes it's corporate, but still fairly classy and the food isn't bad. When I go I usually grab the trio of delicious Kobe sliders served with spicy mustard and another app like the yam frites or the artichoke and spinach dip -- both excellent. The menu is a touch too inclusive which means no real standouts. That said, I really enjoy the meatloaf and the portobello mushroom chicken entrees. The lounge is swell for drinks; try the bellinis if you are so inclined.  Obligatory Title Pun: You don't know a restaurant 'til you've walked a MILE in their STONES.  Menu Readability: Ooh, it's bound in \"leather.\" So fancy.  Need to mention: They have a long patio overlooking Yonge and Dundas square. Great spot in the summer.  What this place teaches me about myself: If stranded in the suburbs, I would easily be able to find sustenance for myself."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, although the service, not so much.  Love their coconut shrimp, chicken sandwich, and chilli Thai chicken bites. For dessert, I always get their white chocolate cheesecake, it's absolutely the best.   The waiters here are super slow, both in the dining and bar side. Asking for water? Forget it, they never bring it to you on time. After ordering your food, it literally takes forever!!   I suggest you shouldn't go here when your dying of hunger, but def no complaints about the food. The chefs are amazing."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my coworker's birthday dinner.   I got the pesto chicken penne asiago and it was so good! It was my first time trying this dish and I wasn't disappointed. I also had the traditional lime mojito, don't get me wrong, but I think it was one of the best mojitos in Toronto.. considering I have tried it at other places. Even though the food was good, it took forever to arrive!! I ordered my drink a while after I came, however only received it after I got my dish.. which was pretty late.  Service.. hmm.. let's say it wasn't the best. I def. prefer this location over the Scarborough location, because their service is horrible. However, the waitress came around a couple of times, but considering it was a birthday dinner, we felt like the waitress should have checked up on us a bit more.   P.s. the main dishes are bit more on the pricier side."}
{"text":"4 of us popped in today for a late bkfst/early lunch. I had the Rustic Chicken Sandwich with a California Salad. It was amazing. The bun for the sandwich was a pumpkin cranberry, which I thought would be too sweet (due to the cranberries), but it was excellent. The salad, with goat cheese, strawberries, onions and spiced pecans, was excellent. I will come back for this. Person 2 had a build you own burger with a California salad. He said it was excellent. Person 3 had the Prime Rib Benny with the hollandaise and horse radish on the side. She raved about it. Person 4 had the regular Eggs Benny. He stated it was \"excellent\".  Our waiter, a chap named Yair, was amazing. Attentive, friendly and efficient...he matched the fantastic food. I will be back....the food is excellent and the staff as equal."}
{"text":"Good beer and a garden burger that was one of the better ones I have had -- and I have experienced a pretty good share of them in many places. Sitting outside on a wonderful weather evening in between tiff activities made a late night dinner that much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"absolutely the best bellini and cosmo not to mention the california burger is sheer perfection! met the gm by chance and he is awesome. love love love this place"}
{"text":"Honestly straight to the point... I recommend this place too anyone who knows what it means to have great customer service. Food was great must try the brunch menu!!! Tones of flavor and you won't be disappointed :) fresh made juice and there spinach dip was amazing. Definitely going back soon:)"}
{"text":"This chain is terrible. I just had a terrible experience a few weeks back at their Queensway location, they fixed the situation and gave me a gift card as an apology. So I figured I'd give them another shot at lunch today at this location (across the from where I work). They gave me a raw chicken sandwich and a brown Caesar salad....stay awesome Milestones and thanks a lot."}
{"text":"The staff tonight was super friendly and amazing. They went above and beyond for sure. Prime rib and steak were on point! Will definitely be coming back soon for dinner and more churro's!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, worst steak I've had up here yet.  Group of 8 of us that just wanted quick drinks and a quick meal, and it took 1.5 hours worth of slow service to get out of a mostly empty restaurant.  Had the food been good, we might have given them a pass.  But the food was bush league, too. Not going back there.  Not worth any more words than that.  Avoid."}
{"text":"So I decided to meet a friend here for a late night appetizer and a drink. We arrived and waited to be seated. The hostess then explained the lounge is self seating. No prob we went on our way.. we noticed a little section 2 steps up from the ground with 2 empty tables, as we were about to sit down the manager came over and told us this area was closed. I found that weird considering there were others already seated in that sections and it looks like they had just gotten there.   We then managed to find a seat at the far end by the bar. Boy was that a MISTAKE!!! The service was the worst thing I have ever experience in a chain restaurant and to top it all off it wasn't even super busy. She came around for us to order our drink and asked several times if we are ordering food. We said we weren't right at this moment but would like to keep a menu in case we decide to later. After a super long wait for our drink a different server came to give us our drinks. A few minutes later our reg lady came back asking to take the menu since we didn't order I said we haven't yet decided.   We then deiced to order the Goat cheese plate. I found it trying to hard with too many additions. I like how the roasted garlic was just sitting on the top of the goat cheese so it was our choice to use it in the spread or not. I liked the fig sauce it came with but didn't feel it needed the cranberries. All in all it was worth a try but probably wouldn't order it again.  I sipped my wine extremely slow because I had no idea as to when she would be back. When i had finished my 8 oz glass I went to the bathroom, I asked my friend to order me a wine with lemon. When I arrived back about 10 mins later, there was still no water. We sat for another 15 mins before she came over to see if we needed anything else. We placed out water order and it took 20 MINUTES to come.. reason is we saw our waitress cleaning the tables before bringing us our water. Then it came with no lemon, I re-asked for the lemon and ended up with limes... Seriously people... GET A GRIP..   Prob will not be going back there for a late night snack"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday night.. good amount of people.   HOLY CR*P was the service exasperatingly slow! We got our appetizers fairly quickly but the entrees took way too long! It wasnt like it was full of people to cause a kitchen back up. Our server hardly checked up on us we had to wave down a waiter twice just to refill our waters after waiting...  Food was good though I got the mahai burger and it was amazing. But by the time the fries got to our table it was cold- ew!  I love the Bellini though!  Wouldn't recommend this place"}
{"text":"I came here with a girlfriend on monday night (7pm~ and it wasn't busy) to be a part of their girls night out deal which consists of 4 apps and 4 bellinis. It was just us 2 and yes we killed it all :) We ordered the Spinach dip. yam fries, chicken bites, and California salad. All were really good - I can't pinpoint which I liked the most.  Spinach dip was creamy and had a lot of flavour to it. Yam fries came with 3 diff sauces (dont know what they were) but we both said the white sauce was the best. Fries were crispy. Chicken bites were covered with sweet thai sauce (good combo) and they were crispy chicken breast pieces. Salad had pecans and strawberries :)  Bellinis are always good! They tasted pretty typical and comparable to many other places but the deal is worth!  4* for food 3.5* for service. Was a tad slow tending to us while the restaurant was not that busy.  Overall would come again."}
{"text":"Superb!!! A restaurant you can truly rely upon! The food, service and ambiance are always exceptional."}
{"text":"Located right near Calgary tower.  Fabulous drinks, great food and great location.  we were walking by and a lady who was out smoking said it is spendy but worth it. we concur :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chocolate ganache torte.  The crust was so delicious it was made of pecans it was soft and had a nice crunch to it! The chocolate ganache was so silky and delicious! It came with catamel sauce which really complimented the torte. I will definetly this order again! I really enjoyed it and its vegan friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Very good surf & turf special, with a flatiron steak and lobster mashed red skin potatoes in a lobster sauce.  I was worried it would be light on the \"surf\" part, but was pleasantly surprised by large pieces of lobster in the mashed potatoes and very creamy lobster sauce with more lobster meat."}
{"text":"Chef's Tasting Menu  I was invited to Milestone Grill + Bar (@MilestonesCa)  to try out their new Summer Chef's Menu (hashtag #milestoneschefmenu) available as of today, I really don't remember when was the last time I have been to Milestone but I do remember that it wasn't great. Since Chef Jason Rosso (@jasonrosso) joined, Milestone have been working to elevate the chain restaurant to an Independent Restaurant Experience.  Within the last 8 months, they have created, tested and launched 15 new menu items with another 10 coming out soon. They are working hard to change the public's notion of the Brand by revitalizing their menu across the 50 locations across the country.   We were treated to a 6 course tasting menu complete with wine pairing provided by Constellation Brands and presented by Dave Grant (@sommdavidgrant).  It was an all seafood menu which is light and refreshing, perfect as summer menu items.   Crispy Quinoa Shrimp ~ Chimmi churri aioli and vegetable slaw ~ paired w/ The People's Wine Pinot Gris ~ The shrimp was quoted with raw quinoa and fried, never had quinoa that way and it resulted in great contrast of texture with the shrimp.  ~ And somehow, it wasn't oily at all which made it very airy and perfect with the spicy and garlicky chimmi churri.    Panko Blue Crab Cakes ~ Fennel and Arugula salad, chipotle aioli ~ paired w/ Kim Crawford's Unoaked Chardonnay  ~ This was made with 100% crab with no filler which you don't find in a lot of places. But I find it a tiny bit heavy on the black pepper and it was a bit much with the spicy chipotle aioli.   Spicy Thai Basil Stirfry ~ Rice Noodles, shrimp and coconut milk ~ paired w/ Inniskillin 2011 East-West Series Riesling-Gewurztraminer ~ This was my fave wine pairing so far, it has a very intense aroma, crisp and well balanced white which was perfect with the spicy stirfry. ~ It says spicy but the previous 2 dishes was actually spicier than this one. ~ Although I like the flavor here, I find the noodle a tiny bit overcook/too soft and it was broken into really small pieces.   Grilled Japanese Tuna Tataki ~ Asparagus and fennel slaw, mandarin dressing ~ paired w/ Le Clos Jordanne (LCJ) Claystone Terrace 2010 Pinot Noir ~ This was my favorite dish of the night, love the coarse salt on top and it had a slightly smokey flavor from the searing.  ~ And love how it was paired with a Pinot Noir, a lighter body red.    \"Surf and Turf\" ~ A duo of grilled flat iron and lobster fricassee ~ paired w/ Dreaming Tree 2010 Cabernet Sauvignon ~ I was surprised at how well cook the flat iron steak was given how thin it was, perfect moist medium rare.  ~ And love the surf part wasn't just the lobster sitting on top but it came with a intense lobster sauce and lobster hash.  Avocado and Lime Tart ~ Brown sugar Chantilly ~ paired w/ Inniskillin 2008 Vidal Icewine ~ Sound like a weird combination but I love how it's not too sweet and had such a creamy smooth texture.  ~ Even with this huge portion, I had no problem finishing it.  Verdict : ~ We were both fully impressed with this new menu and definitely change my mind about Milestone. ~ I highly recommend giving them another chance."}
{"text":"Visiting from Houston, I got the four cheese burger. But what really thrilled me was the appetizer. We had ordered the calamari strips with andouille sausage. But they ran out! So instead we got the steamed mussels and the frittes. They were awesome. Spicy and silky without too much of an overbearing sauce. The mussels were plump and juicy. The burger, as the waiter stated, had to be near well done to avoid possible food poisoning. I keep forgetting about mad cow disease up here. But it was an excellent burger with four types of cheeses. The atmosphere is a hip retro, date environment. Definitely a possible repeat place."}
{"text":"I frequent this Milestones quite a lot, and I think the food here is quite good if you order the right thing.   On this occasion, I was here to sample their new seasonal menu because it had several \"Top Chef Canada Winning Dish\" inspired items. The key word here is \"inspired\", because I can't imagine the contestants winning the challenge if they really served what we ate.  One of my favourites here is the calamari steak strips. You can really taste the calamari and the spicy  sausage ragu and lemon aioli are great to dip in.   As for the top chef dishes, the pork croquette was very underwhelming, because it just tasted like fried meatball. The presentation also wasn't great because the onion rings were so different in sizes. To be fair, the croquettes themselves were decently tasty, but that spicy chili pepper aioli was completely bland and indistinguishable from the aioli served with the calamari. I was very disappointed by this dish.  The winning main dish- roasted sablefish with seaweed gnocchi was also not very good. The gnocchi had a strange texture and the broth was just weird!   For dessert, Milestones' break-up tub caught my eye - an individual sized tub of premium vanilla cookie dough ice cream, house-made caramel and crumbled chunks of baked double chocolate cookie. It was a very cute dessert and I liked it quite a lot.   After this meal, I decided that I'll try to stick to Milestones' regular menu, for I never had anything that satisfied me from their seasonal menus."}
{"text":"Was very very disappointed at this location of milestones. I am normally not a fan of chain restaurants anyway, but this was a particularly bad experience. The only positive thing is that they have a fairly nice patio. However, the food was really horrible. I shared a Wednesday date night menu with 2 other people and ordered spinach dip, steak frites, and white chocolate cheesecake. The spinach dip was okay, nothing to write home about. But the steak frites was amongst the worst that I've ever tasted. The meat was bland, over cooked, and devoid of any flavour of beef. The accompanying fried onions was simply offensive and inedible. The only good thing was the fries... Why would I order a steak just for tasty fries? The cheesecake was passable, but it took them more than 20 min to bring it out? Surely, they don't make this cheesecake from scratch?  Overall, service was very very slow and I will never come back to this location"}
{"text":"Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing.  There's a chance I've been spoiled by the good food in the south. Whatever the case, I was highly disappointed with my lunch.  I ordered the fish tacos, which looked amazing on the menu, by the way... but the fish was obviously previously frozen, still cold, and had absolutely no flavor.  I ended up eating the avocado pieces only and leaving the whole tacos behind. Avocado never disappoints."}
{"text":"I had the prime rib. Wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about. Beer was fairly priced. 18 Oz for 6.95."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my partner for a light dinner.   Service here is really bad. We waited quite a while at the front before being seated. Once we got the menus it too the server forever to come over to our table. We ordered drinks and waited for them forever as well.   Once she decided to come back for our food orders we were already a bit turned off. Our food came quite quickly but the chicken on my salad was a bit dry and didn't even look like a full chicken breast.   After our food was dropped off, the server never came back to the table to check how we were doing. We were ready to leave and I had to ask the hostess to pack up our leftover food and bring the bill.   Once the server dropped off the bill she took another 15 mins before coming with the debit machine to the table.   Overall this was very bad service at this location and we will not return. We really enjoy Milestones menu so that's really too bad that we had this negative experience."}
{"text":"Me and my friend ordered, two different pasta and both of them were awful. Service was good and we were lucky to find a table in patio which was nice but I wish food was good too."}
{"text":"A convenient spot right off the highway to meet.  I love the California Salad and the menu is fairly good for a chain.  Not an experience I would rave about but it is a solid option."}
{"text":"Went to Milestones for a friend's bday and to be honest, I'm not a hugeee fan of milestones. Sometimes I feel like they're overrated and for the food I get? I rather go somewhere else.  But nonetheless, it was my friend's bday so Angela and I headed there to celebrate her day.  The Milestones location that we went to was at North York Centre or sometimes better known as Empress Walk.  The decor is rather stylish and on a Saturday night, the crowd was the young and clich√© type. Most people well dressed so as a heads up, dress up a little to blend in. The lights were dimmed and the mood set for a more intimate experience. My apologies for the photo quality ahead of time.  Didn't order any drinks and as my main, I ordered the Californian style burger with sweet potato fries. The Californian burger was topped with fresh house-made avocado salsa, double-smoked bacon, lettuce, a pickle and even more tomato. The bun was a sesame seed bun.  And looks perfect for the burger.  Angela got their seasonal item which was Braised Beef Pappardelle with a nice cream base and cheese. The food took a while to come, at about 20 mins or so and at this occasion I was able to test their service for a large party. I do this by the number of water refills.  Once the food arrived I took a bite of the sweet potato fries and... Not cripsy, sucks.  I don't believe that this was solely caused because of the dish sitting and waiting to be served with others. But I believe it might be the lack of batter on the fries. It was lightly battered and appeared to be cooked in older oil.  The burger tho, surprisingly quite good. I was honestly surprised. The patty was nicely seasoned and wasn't dry.  I'm not sure if I got lucky but I still somehow feel that Milestones serves frozen not fresh patties.  Nonetheless, everything worked and I would have to say, Milestones served me a good burger tonight. Angela and her dish, once again very surprised.  She asked me what looks good and looking at their seasonal menu, this item stood out.  The beef was tender, the pasta cooked well and the sauce was perfect. I have to say even with the good burger, I 100% wish I had her dish instead. It was very good.  Overall, I would have to say that at this occasion, I liked Milestones. Maybe it was one of their good days, maybe. But the food that was served was good. My only complaints would be service and the fries.  My water never got refilled. We were there for 2 hours and you couldn't refill my water, you serious? Everyone that ordered water didn't get a refill, so guess what Mr. Waiter, I tip accordingly. Tho my friend brought up a good point, he said with this tip he's gonna think I'm just another cheap young chinese fella.  It probably doesn't help that I look like I'm 19.  So service sucked, but the food was good, your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":": Milestones  : Stacked Chicken Parmesan : Milestones is a go to, decided to try something new but this had disappointed me :( I would give it a 10/10 of there were flavour! : Chicken was flavourless and the pasta was plain (Suppose to be tossed in a basil pesto cream sauce) : $21 : 3/10"}
{"text":"I was staying across the street so it was very convenient. I walked in and seated myself immediately. The waiter was friendly and prompt. It's very much a bar-type place, a little loud with the televisions for my taste. The place was clean. I ordered the steak frites. The steak was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. I loved the fries with the aioli. It was a touch pricey for the selection, but you can easily eat for under $30CAN with no alcohol.   I would go back when visiting the area."}
{"text":"I was genuinely really pleasantly surprised by how good this place was.  The food was delicious and got better as everything came to our table, and it just put me in a really good mood.  As well, our waitress was very nice, and service was super quick.  I would happily come back here for another night out :) ."}
{"text":"Sat in a poorly lit area, appetizer dip was cold on top and runny and my pasta was cold, salty and nothing spectacular. Our waitress came once only  to check on us on after the last plate was set down. She never returned to ask if we wanted a drink refill, coffee or dessert (which we did). She also messed up an order and implied that it was our fault. Lastly, no one came to clear our plates for some time after we all finished eating. I wouldn't go out of my way to come to this location. Not worth what you pay."}
{"text":"We were four, and other than waiting what seemed like an eternity for water, the experience was pretty good.  You won't be licking your plate at the end (wait, you really shouldn't be doing that anywhere, except at home, or if there's chocolate involved), but the grub here is quite satisfactory.   California prime rib burger was piled high, with some delish avocado mix and not short on the bacon!  Thai chicken bowl, not shy on the spice (but we asked for it), was a decent pass in an american chain restaurant.   And I hear the food selection changes often, and they've shock top on the beer menu (which I haven't seen in Toronto restos that much)  Our wait staff was great and gave a great rundown of the specials. The prices err on the higher side, but nothing that will burn a hole in your pants.  I won't go out of the way to eat here, but if you're at Yorkdale, looking for a chain restaurant with good food, maybe worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Bad service. Avoid. I don't even think I need to say anymore because that pretty much sums up the experience.  My friend and I specifically came here to sit on the patio. Specifically. We let the front desk person know, who said it would be a 20 min wait and gave us a buzzer. No problem. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks and some apps.  Let's talk about the drinks and food first - it came out quickly, so we were off to a good start. However, the raspberry mojito tasted like watered down syrup without an ounce of alcohol. The second drink, Unusual suspect, a bourbon concoction was actually good - a glimmer of hope. The flatbread apps were... meh.   Okay, 40 minutes later, our buzzer hadn't lit up so we asked one of the servers to follow up on our patio request. Never came back. Another 40 minutes later - we were done our food and drinks, and still no buzzing! In fact, our server just took the buzzer with her when she cleared our plates.  I was bummed. Really. Especially because I was treating my friend to her birthday and we just wanted to enjoy drinks on the patio.  And $55 for two apps and two drinks, really? There is no way this place deserves to charge that much given it's service level, and meh-food.  Step up yo' game Milestone's."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.. But milestones is one of those \"always reliable\" places, where your almost guaranteed to find something you like...   The menu isn't anything special. they have the standards, and they're all done pretty well. I've had the creamy pesto chicken pasta and it's tasty if your in the mood for that. They used to have a better burger with 3 cheese and roasted garlic but they replaced it with strange options like a burger topped with smoked meat..? Really? Lol I got their classic burger for 15.50 which comes with cheese and bacon. It was alright. Not worth it in my opinion. Get something else even if the burger is the cheapest thing on the menu. 16 dollars for an ok burger is not cool in my books. Definitely have to try something new when I go back next time. Their peach belinis are what they're known for drink wise, and they're really good.   My friend ordered an oriental noodle dish with steak and it looked like mr noodle with blubbery steak on the side. When the waitress came to take her full plate of food away at the end of the meal, she did not ask about the meal at all.  Overall, milestones is a hit or miss. Meals average between 16.00 and 26 dollars. The food is pretty good depending on what you get, and if you sit on the balcony at this location you have s great view of downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on the weekend around noon.  I wanted to order the Prime Rib Benny on their brunch menu (one of their signature dishes recommended) but they said the prime rib would not be ready until another hour or so... unfortunately.  Ordered the California Eggs Benny instead which was average.    The good thing about this place is the atmosphere and parking.  Located right next to the theater so it's convenient.  If i'm looking for a quick bite before watching a movie, I may come back but other than that, not much to rave about."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great. I got the beef bolongese it was ok I felt like the pasta was a little under cooked for my liking but then again I like my pasta a bit soft. People that were with me got a chicken sandwich and a burger which they said were average as well. Nothing special about this place."}
{"text":"It's a chain, so you're going to get the typical box-store-restaurant experience. But at least this version is above average.  The service is very friendly, and other than being slow to refill drinks, is more than efficient. If you avoid alcohol the bill will be quite reasonable.  The food is good, I had an amazing burger and went for the \"Mayan\" option which includes an avocado relish topping. Worth the extra money. The fries are ok, but tend towards the disappointing side rather than the wow-factor. Too oily and not soggy in a good way like you would find in an English chip-shop."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. It was on a Father's Day! I decided to treat my parents. So when we went there they told us to wait for 5-10 min to be seated. After we we're seated we ordered. It was quite busy we could tell. I noticed there were still plenty of empty tables around. After our orders we waited for the food. The time kept passing by. After 20 mins we asked our service attendant can she inquire about our food. How much longer could it take. She explained that it was a busy day. She asked whether the front reception explained to us about delay in Service? We replied that we were not informed. Only that we had wait to be seated. We started sipping water and kept waiting for the food. We noticed some patrons came after us and already received their food. After 40 minutes we again inquired if the food was ready. The waitress replied that the food should be ready very soon. After 1 hour my father just lost it. Patrons around us were done eating and started leaving the restaurant. We still did not get any food and neither we got any explanation or apologies for this catastrophe!! We received our food after 1 hour and five minutes. This unforgivable treatment made us lose our appetite. The food did not taste good at all. I still paid the usual Tip I pay for food. I realized that it wasn't the watress's fault. The management is simply horrible. I would never visit a Milestones establishment ever again. All the ways they could have fixed the problem or make up for this treatment, they did nothing!!!"}
{"text":"As chains restaurants go, this place is more or less pretty decent.  Similar to Earl's, it is slightly more \"upscale\" than your average chain ... and this goes for the prices as well.  Which leads me to my question: Why not just go to a better non-chain restaurant? You'll have a more unique experience, you'll be supporting a local business, and your food will (probably) be better quality.  Don't get me wrong ... there are some things that Milestones does quite well! If you're in the mood for a girly-girl kinda drink, their Bellinis are excellent. Now being Italian, I never thought of a Bellini as being a necessarily \"girly\" drink before, but Milestones makes them look so ... pretty. So prepare to check your testosterone at the door and enjoy a delicious alchoholic slurpee.  Their mains don't commonly seem to be as good as their appies, and with many of them being $20+, I would be had-pressed to recommend any of them.  But I must say, they seem to have some decent daily specials during the week, so I could see myself visiting the odd time for a drink or an appetizer."}
{"text":"Oh Milestones, what a suitable name for such a disaster of an establishment you call a restaurant. Exactly how many milestones must you reach to actually get your act together?   Brunch, or lack thereof. We went in, all of us, a group of 8. Simple enough, we wanted a quick brunch before hitting the stores. Not so. Tragic really. I still wince at the thought of this place. Took about half an hour to get seated even though the restaurant was only half full. Waiter seemed flustered, perhaps new to the game? Who knows, didn't care, I was hungry and would just about eat anything that wouldn't eat me first, or so I thought.   Took this poor kid about 45 minutes to get our simple drinks in order, think OJ and coffee type drinks, no cocktails, it is brunch after all, I prefer to do my drinking after 2:00 thank you very much.   Took our orders, mostly eggy hash browny type menu items, shouldn't take too long right? Uh, not so much. I attempted to order the prime rib hash -no deal- outta prime rib, so I ordered the substitute, chicken. An hour and a bit later, comes the food. At this juncture, I was about ready to get up and hit the food court! So I get a plate of what looks like dog puke plopped in front of me to dig into. Yum! How could you not want to dig into something that looks like poo? It was supposed to be this delicious medley of taters, corn, onions and tomatoes with poached eggs on top with a special blend of seasonings finished with hollandaise. First off it was slathered with Bulls Eye steak sauce, I did not taste these special seasonings they speak of, nor did I see any hollandiase either as a matter of fact. The tomatoes were two wedges of what looked like clearance produce placed on the side of the plate as in a garnish, and not actually part of the meal, and had an ambiguous odour. Oh yes, and the replacement chicken, lunch meat style sliced very thin, bacon like, so thin that it was mostly burnt. mmmm mmm, now seriously, how could you not want to eat that to start off your day?   Ok, I pushed that aside and decided to dig into the plentiful bounty of the side of fruit they call a salad. In case you haven't noticed, I am so being sarcastic . Here it is kids, 2 orange slices and a wedge of crunchy honeydew melon that tasted more like a cucumber. No, this was no salad, this was plain mockery. Seriously. And I was charged for this! Where were my berries, my grapes, my cantaloupe? Hello?   You better bet your sweet behind I had something to say. Manager removed disgraced hash from my presence and took it off the bill, seeing how I never ate it! She was really nice and apologetic, obviously not her fault the kitchen dropped the ball but none-the-less, NEVER GOING BACK.   Dry heaving."}
{"text":"Disaster Dirty avoid don't even think about it!  Stopped in for a drink after a great meal elsewhere.  Not all that busy (most tables open).  Didn't have unsweetened tea  after 10 mins of checking didn't have bottled water ok how about club soda.  I ordered a drink after 25 mins (total 40 mins now) gave up left forget it.  Total don't give a damn attitude.  Food coming out was total chain looking - expected but can't even get drink service right.  Sad because nice spot with deck."}
{"text":"Meh, mediocre food. Service is good however, and drinks outside is always a fun time! Lunch can be quite busy, so make sure you come a bit earlier."}
{"text":"My boyfriend received a BOGO deal via email which was why we chose to dine with Milestones this evening. Usually Milestones has great service and food at the various locations we visited but not the one on Queensway.  Service started out fast in which we were seated immediately during the dinner rush, and drinks and salads came out pretty soon after we ordered. We were disappointed that they ran out of the Italian sausage ravioli so we tried the grilled chicken penne asiago. Additionally, we ordered a regular sized medium rare prime rib to share. The pasta was decent but definitely overpriced. There were barely any chicken pieces and the entree was a bit salty. Sadly this was when the service went downhill. We didn't receive our prime rib until 30 minutes later since we ordered it. The wait was so long that we expected a delicious prime rib. We were disappointed when it finally arrived at our table. I have to admit that the prime rib I made last week was definitely better...I'm not even joking.   The next time I want to eat at Milestones it definitely will not be at the Queensway location."}
{"text":"Went to Milestones for brunch/lunch on a Saturday at around 1pm and found that service was non-existent. The place was not busy and only half full. Arrived to find an empty hostess table and waited around for a while. Walked up to a waitress and asked her to see if we were supposed to seat ourselves. Staff said someone should be at the hosted table so we went back. Hostess was here finally and brought us to a table with menus. We decided on what to order but no waitress/waiter ever approached us. Waited for another ten minutes and still no one came to serve us. We then left left and still no one noticed when we walked out. Worst service ever, or more like no service at all."}
{"text":"Lots of TVs, a nice bar area, large dining room, stack stones, wood, dark furniture.  Hmmm...Moxies? Earls? Joey's? Chop?...nope...Milestones.  It's the same theme...and it works.  If it didn't we'd see a whole industry makeover.  I am seeing myself slowly dropping off of these types of places.  I have started gravitating back to the local pubs as the fad is fading.  I know that I am in the minority, as the tightly cladded min-clothing place of the hotties are still packing it in, but aren't they all the same?  By the time you have a few beers and a small meal, you are out $60-all in.  I was out over a Benji tonight as my bud flipped for the bill - I lost.  LOL.  I'd tell you what I had for dinner but I can't.  The meals are so the same that there is nothing to remember it by.  For those who like to drink as the sun beats down on you, the patio should be open soon.  It is southerly exposed and nicely arranged.  Do remember though that the patio is next to a bridge that overpasses the train to the east of the restaurant.  Lots of traffic, exhaust fumes, dust (from the constant construction in the area), and noise.  It is however a great place to hang after hours.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I only came for drinks & an appetizer to catch up with an old friend. The spinach artichoke dip was tasty, our beers were reasonable priced, and our waitress was very sweet. Exactly what I expected of a Milestones, no more, no less!"}
{"text":"Friday night after work and thought we would go to the bar.  The staff at the bar are very friendly and great atmosphere.  We ordered off the appetizer menu which has a lot of variety.  Their prime rib sliders are divine and worth $5 for each slider.  We also shared the California salad that was delicious! The salad had goat cheese, strawberry a and pecans...one of my favourite salads at Milestones.  Also did their goat cheese appetizer that came with fig jam, a relish and some toasted bread.  Great meal and a fun Friday night.  Also a tip...be sure to show your CAA card as can get a free appetizer which is great value."}
{"text":"I was here tonight for my brother's birthday. Really good experience. The host was very friendly and seated us right away to our reserved table. She asked if it was our first time at that location and when we said yes she said they'll have something for us.  Our waiter Andrew came and took our order and told us we'd be getting a free spinach dip since it was our first visit. Score!   Honestly it breaks my heart that Milestones changed their menu because their seafood salad was my favourite thing in the world so every time I go I'm scrambling looking for something on the menu to eat that's decently healthy.  I ended up getting the salmon, it came on a bed of rice with some veggies. It was very good but could have used some more sauce. My mom got the mediterranean chicken which she loves (I've tried bites, it's very good!) and my dad and boyfriend got the prime rib which they loved, my brother got one of the pastas not sure which one but he too was happy.   Overall it was a really nice experience. The service was great, Andrew was a very good waiter. Also the decor was very very nice compared to other locations! And at the end of the meal we got $5 coupons for our next visit and the opportunity to do a survey online which granted us a free app we could use anytime. Great marketing.  I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with a friend over dinner.  Initially everything was good. We were seated promptly and given our drinks quickly. It was ladies night so we ordered a lobster and crab dip to share. I feel as if they gave us either too many tortilla chips or not enough dip. It was very tasty though.   I ended up ordered the steak, not sure which one, but holy it was a thick steak. about 1.75 inches. Kind of hard to cut. It was dry at first but then became juicier as I went further into the steak.  I wasn't blown away by the entree I ordered."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Wednesday for lunch and took part in the \"Wednesday Date Night\" where 2 people could dine for $50 which I thought was a great deal. It came with 1 appetizer to share, 2 entr√©es, and 1 dessert to share.  We got the Hot Spinach & Artichoke Dip, which was super tasty. Bubbling and super cheesy which was fabulous. My friend and I both got Steak Frites which came with Parmesan fries, crispy buttermilk onion strings and a tasty truffle aioli. For dessert we got a ganache torte that had a pecan crust and a salted caramel sauce. It was amazing.  The service at this Milestones was great and if I were in the area again I definitely would come back here."}
{"text":"Went here for their Wednesday Date Night special.   For $50 you get one appetizer to share, 2 entrees, and a dessert.   It is a great deal but your entree choices are limited to 5 or 6 choices.     For the appetizer, we had the Mediterranean bruschetta which was really delicious and on fresh flatbread.   I had the grilled chicken which was essentially 2 small chicken breasts with goat cheese in the middle with bok choy and chickpeas.  It was interesting and the chicken was juicy.   Dessert was the apple crumble which was also nice, although the ice cream was oddly crunchy.     Overall, it was a nice experience and the staff were friendly and efficient.   If you don't order alcoholic drinks it is a good value for a \"date night\""}
{"text":"I went to Milestones with a friend recently for dinner and since the Jays game was playing, we took a seat at the bar. When the bartender came over to us to take our order, I asked for a glass of Kim Crawford. She looked a bit confused, so I said, the Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. She asked for my ID, and I provided my driver's licence.   I'm 32 (turning 33 next month) but I'm asian and do look a few years younger than I am, so while I was a little surprised, I happily obliged. My friend ordered a beer, and the bartender asked for his ID as well. She took a quick look at my friend's ID and gave it back to him. Then looked at mine, looked at me, and looked at my ID again. She asked me how old I am and I told her I'm nearly 33. She stared blankly at me, so I said again, I'm currently 32 but I turn 33 next month. She looked at my ID again and asked me for a second piece. I provided my credit card, and she said no, that wouldn't work. (I checked when I got home and acceptable forms of secondary pieces of ID include anything with an imprint of your name and signature. Credit cards are acceptable). I pulled out all of the cards I had in my purse to no avail. I asked what she was looking for, and added that the only thing I don't have on me is my health card and she said that was what I needed to provide. When I said I'm sorry but I do not usually carry my health card with me, she told me she would not serve me any alcohol because I look considerably younger than my ID, could not produce a secondary piece of ID (I could - just not the one she wanted), and that she didn't think my photo looked anything like me.   At this point, I thought something was up. First, my ID is real. I am a 32-year-old woman with government-issued ID which I provided. I answered the question she asked me correctly. And I provided a secondary piece of ID that she refused to accept.   When I got home, I also learned that it is illegal to ask someone to supply their Health Card as a form of ID. Here's a link to the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO) where it says \"By law, no one can be required to produce the Ontario Health Card.\" (Source: http://www.agco.on.ca/en/whatwedo/legal_age_id.aspx)  Finally, my photo looks IDENTICAL to me. I haven't lost or gained weight. I haven't coloured my hair, changed my hairstyle, wear glasses now, or anything that would make my appearance different than that of my photo. I also have never had anyone question the authenticity of my ID or my photo before. I felt quite unfairly treated. She didn't ask me any additional questions as the Smart Serve Ontario guidelines suggest a bartender/server do. She didn't examine my photo in the light, or ask another bartender or server for a second opinion. She simply decided that I wasn't what or who I said I was and wouldn't serve me. Shocked and insulted, my friend asked me if I wanted to leave, and I said yes. He too felt the bartender's treatment of me to be unfair.    In what world can I walk into a bar at 32 years of age with my valid government-issued photo ID and be refused service because a bartender took one look at me and made up her mind that I was some 18-year-old kid just trying to scam a drink.   I will never return to this establishment, and I have certainly shared my story with friends and colleagues. The funny thing is, I didn't even really want that glass of wine. I just wanted to have a nice dinner with my friend and watch the game, but because we were seated at the bar I thought, hey why not? How silly of me."}
{"text":"Very shocking experience.....   Last night  , I went to there with my sister. We sit at out door dinning area.  She ordered a grill chicken penne ( which has some fresh vegetable on top ) ~  When the food come up, there was a lady bug running inside out on that salad on top. So we ask the waitress come to change it.  The service was very nice and super sorrowful. Even manage come by and apology and promised to make up a BRAND NEW ONE.   Surprisingly , what came up is the same  penne and same vege ! But mixed fried with the salad on top and reheated so u think it's different !!   The bread got all black out becoz they just heated up same thing again !!  They didn't make a new one , they were \" REMAKING \" and \" lying \" !  I didn't want to point that out last Night not only becoz my sister didn't notice the  but also the calm and peace atmosphere.  I knew that if the manager Over there allow their chief to do such things , They wouldn't admit what they have done.   Truly disappointed ! And how could people who make food has such a bad manner !"}
{"text":"This was my first, and hopefully my last time going to Milestones. After hearing that It was great, and wanting to try something new while in downtown, my family and I decided to head here, to enjoy a nice meal. I was so disappointed. We started with basic appetizers that were absolutely delicious, and so I decided to get a pasta, cause I mean, you can never go wrong with Pasta (Pesto Chicken Penne Asiago was the one I got). I waited almost an hour for it, and when I got it, it was cold and the parmesan was dry and you could literally peel it off. Being honest It was a good dish, and it was just that it was delivered so late, that made it worse. My parents and siblings, all decided to get the Chicken Parmesan, for which they had to wait another 20 more minutes after I got my cold dish. The chicken parmesan was burnt and was kind of distasteful, tasting more like a bar of soap than chicken. We left the place, still hungry with almost half of our foods on our plates. The servers were nice, even though they switched a few times, which could possibly be why the food took to long. The lighting was also strangely dimmer than I'd expect it to be, and I frankly didn't enjoy the layout of the place. Didn't meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Good stuff... I also walked in from the mall side and was immediately confused.... you need to basically walk through the entire restaurant (like you are walking in the back door) to get to the front where a host/hostess should greet you.   We found no one there... so ventured up the cool stairs because we knew our reservation was for upstairs.   At the top of the stairs we were greeted appropriately, got a drink at the bar (as we were a couple minutes early).  The bar staff was funny, warm and nice.  We took our drinks over to our 16 person table... along the front window looking down onto Yonge Street.  What a fantastic table... the view was amazing.   I find that nothing really jumps off the menu for me at Milestones... I believe this is a chain thing, rather than something at this location specifically.   So, for a lack of something special to try, I went for my standard burger... but got it done \"Californian\".  It was delicious... which is what I expected.   The service was good... funny... quick... food orders were good.  Our server handled our large party very well.   A for service B for food C for food selection A for decor and view B for organization because you need a sign at the rear entrance telling peeople where to go.  B+ overall... I would go back.  :)"}
{"text":"I've only had Milestones a handful of times. This particular location sits across from the Cineplex. On a busy Sunday afternoon; it's difficult to find a good parking spot. I ended up parking near the Scotiabank. The walk is a nice pre meal exercise before the mid day feast.  Brunch at milestones is awesome. Especially for those who had a long late night and woke up too late to have breakfast! I had ordered the smoked salmon with salad and my friend ordered the pork ribs. My salmon was good but I regret not ordering that pork ribs. It was fall off the bones, succulent tasting, juicy unforgettable rib. You might even say I had an orgasm just explaining it.  But really the food was great. I really like the variety of bacon and egg choices they have on their brunch menu.   Other than that service was as usual and nothing to complain. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"For a milestones I was VERY disappointed. I usually count on consistency between chains and I have never been to a milestones as bad as this one. Server was decent but the food was terrible. They did not know how to cook a steak, and couldn't even get their version of pad Thai down... I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I've been to this milestone' s in the past and it has always been a good experience with great food and service. However, when I came here with my in laws, husband and 2 kids, we were beyond disappointed. Not only have the prices increased by around $4-5, so the dishes are around $20 a person, but the food wasn't amazing. My husband ordered the Chipotle sirloin fettuccine which was waaay too spicy and the beef was tough, the flavour was off, my mother in law ordered a rustic chicken sandwich and the bread was as hard as a rock and stale, chicken was dry. My dish was actually decent and I did like the flavoring, the chicken Penne pasta. In terms of service, the waitress wasn't very attentive and didn't seem to care, she gave us a small table despite having 2 kids and a stroller, and she never asked to refill our water during our 2 hour meal. The washrooms were also quite dirty, not like I remembered it from before."}
{"text":"And the usual garlic bread wasn't the same. But As usual we were met with a smile upon getting there. The server even remembered us, which felt nice, although the last time we went there was a while ago.  Their date night menu was great  The goat cheese platter was amazing- must try  I ordered the Thai red curry, - lovely   The Moscow Mule was amazzing - must try   Overall a lovely night out"}
{"text":"I was on my way out for Brunch at a near by restaurant when I noticed then line was out the door. There was no way I was going to wait in the line for breakfast there. As we drove into the STC grounds I saw a big banner hanging outside of the Milestone's advertising there Brunch. It was practically screaming out to us so we decided to give them a try!  Luckily this place had no line up and the restaurant was not even half full. Our waiter kindly greeted us, went over the menus, and took our drink orders. She later returned with our teas and coffees and we are all ready to order. The brunch menu is simple consisting of benedicts, omeletes, scrambled egg variations, and few sweet options like french toast and pancakes plus offerings from there lunch menu.  Our orders included:  Milestone's Traditional Breakfast Double smoked bacon, 3 eggs, multi grain toast and breakfast potatoes topped  with mediterranean salsa  Milestone's Big Breakfast Double smoked bacon, ham, adouille sausage, 3 eggs, french toast and breakfast potatoes topped with mediterranean salsa  Strawberry French Toast Thick cut cinnamon vanilla French Toast, fresh strawberries, agave syrup and mago cream garnish. I found it interesting how they made french toast with the baguette and it was definitely a huge portion. My only complaint was that I hate when french is drowning in a pool of a syrup because it makes it too soggy. And this french toast came out in a pool syrup. Had I know that I would have asked for the syrup on the side because it was otherwise pretty tasty.  Prime Rib Hash Thinly sliced AAA prime rib, potatoes, bell peppers, sweet onions, roasted corn, dressed with there specialty hash seasoning topped with two poached eggs, house made hollandaise, and herb toast This was definitely the best dish! So flavourful, good portion, cooked perfectly! Would definitely order this again!  Overall I'd say Milestone's is definitely a good place to try out for Brunch especially if you have a large group because they don't get as full as the other chain brunch restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, service was fast and friendly! 4 of us went here and ordered the red Thai curry, sweet chili crispy chicken bowl, baja fish tacos, and spicy crispy fried noodles. We all finished our meals. The fries are some of the best we've ever had as well! Located centrally around a lot of great places. Highly recommend to all!"}
{"text":"A huge shout out to the staff and management of Milestones!! We are both Vegan and for the second time, as we saw little as far as entrees go on the menu, asked if the chef was in the mood to just make us a Vegan Pasta dish with veg!! The sign of a good chef and a good team when everyone pulls together. Server came out a few times and mentioned things we were not aware of, and the manager actually served us our meals and came back after ( not mid bite with mouthful) to see how we liked the meal...chatted with us, we told him we were very happy..he said they will try to accommodate pretty much any type of diet or allergy including making sure there is no cross contamination for people with allergies!! He even gave us a free appy card for next time!!Thank you so much!! We will be back!  We eat in the lounge...it gets super busy and energetic , service was fast!! Great datenight!!! Thumbs up!"}
