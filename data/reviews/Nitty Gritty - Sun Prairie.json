{"text":"I really like the ambience here, so I'll probably be back for drinks. But the food is awful. My burger wasn't cooked right, suffered from too much grease (and resulting sogginess), and the garnish was mostly composed of a GARGANTUAN lettuce butt. It really peeved me to think that a person with any cognitive abilities at all would slap that on a burger. Two thumbs WAY down."}
{"text":"Horrible. Go to Willy Ty's.  I understand downtown Nitty Gritty doing OK due to the college crowd, but the food is bad.  Nice bar I will assume this will not last much longer."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else. Cheese curds are good but burgers dry. This was our second visit, wanted to give then a second chance. Won't go back.  A small glass of domestic tap beer is $4!! Way overpriced!"}
{"text":"Went to this place two times in a row to celebrate a birthday and got the same result. 
Let me start by saying that this place is overrated, dirty and overpriced. 

Cons: The worst Nitty Gritty I've been to, this bar cannot even compared to Madison & Middleton's Nitty. They have some of the worst customer service ever. How can you CALLED yourself an OFFICIAL BIRTHDAY PLACE and offered FREE drink for birthday boy/girl and literally take the birthday mug from birthday boy for excessive amount of alcohol consumption? Explain that?

Pro: None. Don't waste your time.

P.S. Terrible service. Strongly advise for minority not to go."}
{"text":"Recently, we stopped in for the first time.  We went during Sunday Brunch.  The drinks and food came out fast.  I ordered the chipotle burger with fries and they were both very good.  My husband got the Gritty burger with steamed vegetables which ended up being asparagus and red peppers and those were great.  The only negative was that it took about 10 minutes for our server to get our check after we paid and that wasn't too bad.   We'll probably be back."}
{"text":"Went here on 2 separate occasions for birthdays for my children and some close friends.  The service was good, fast and friendly for the most part.  We got seated quickly as it was early in the evening around 5 pm and were served our drinks and sodas for the kids quickly.  We ordered our dinner and it arrived 10 minutes later which was great as the younger crowd has little to no patience.  We ate and  finished our drinks and were done with in an hour which is great since we also had sporting events to get to that evening as well.  The birthday boy got a balloon and also a free kiddie cocktail which made him feel special.  The food was only average at best and slightly over priced for what we got which is why I'm  rating it at 3 stars.  The service on the other hand was very friendly."}
{"text":"Overall it was a big let down on my birthday. We had a group of 5 and all of us had some sort of issue with our food. All but one if us ordered the special burger of the day and they were horrid.The burger didn't fit the bun and it was under seasoned. We all ended up taking the top portion of our buns off because it was too thick, yet the bottom was soggy and falling apart.  The other person ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and had the same issue with the bun. Also, it was supposed to come with ranch which our waitress didn't bring until after we asked 3 times. I also got my food 20 plus minutes after my group, even though it was the same thing.  The fries were so chewy we barely ate any. Our waitress never apologized for any of the issues and was not attentive to our table at all. We were never offered refills on our drinks even. I did get the free mug and beer at the bar but the bartender was less than accommodating.

Needless to say that was the first and last time we will be going there to eat.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"A group of us watched the Badgers basketball game last night. The place was very busy and noisy but our waitress was exceptional and we were treated very good. We had appetizers that were great and were brought out quickly. We will be going back."}
{"text":"Ok. I really love the Nitty Gritty restaurant downtown Madison. What happened? This location was very disappointing. 6 servers standing around chatting when I have to ask for sweetener, napkins, utensils, even the bill. Had to ask 3 times for a to go box. So sub par for franchise. Pull it together guys or your  fresh coat of paint and awkward seating will just help the next restaurant. Wake up management! Terrible experience!"}
{"text":"Went on my birthday. How can you beat drinking for free on your bday? Decent craft beer selection with an emphasis on local microbreweries. I ordered the WI grass fed burger and onion rings. It was a tasty burger! Fun ambience, great happy hour and decent nightly drink specials."}
{"text":"Good food. The gritty burger is their signature. Cheese curds are the best. Friday nights seem to be a little understaffed. Service was good but not great. Will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for a late lunch and sat in the bar area.  Waitress attentive and the food excellent as always.  Great place for a date night or just talk without too much noise.  The burgers were yummy and the fries perfect!"}
{"text":"Horrible service; food is marginal.  Went on a Sunday for lunch with 6 friends and our waitstaff didn't inform us of specials, didn't want to answer menu questions, and knew nothing about the gluten free menu.  She brought us a wrong order and acted offended when it was returned.  We won't be back.  Save your $ and find a better restaurant with decent service."}
{"text":"I had the biggest craving for a cheeseburger, and Nitty Gritty not only satisfied the craving, but they knocked it out of the park! Their beer selection and drink menu were up to par, and I highly recommend their Moscow Mules. I went on a Friday night, and they had $3 drink specials. Even the rail drinks were pretty decent. Excellent food! I ordered the \"Gritty Burger\" with a side of waffle fries. Everything was perfect! As long as I'm living here in Madison, consider me a regular!"}
{"text":"The burgers and sandwiches are seriously amazing! Very tasty & juicy... The staff is always friendly and very attentive and helpful. The pretzel chicken sandwich is a must try...so unique and so delicious! Very fun and casual atmosphere... Never too loud or too quiet."}
{"text":"We have tried this place a few times. Food is mediocre. The mojito I tried tasted awful. Service was definitely lacking. On one occasion we had wanted to go out for my birthday, we arrived at 11:45 and the person working told us we couldn't come in and they were closing. On a Friday night! Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The pretzels were soggy and one was ice in the center. It was clear that they were microwaved, probably frozen from SIsko Foods. They do not give you plates to set anything on just a basket. Onion rings, also probably frozen, were greasy and had way too much breaking on them. There is an up charge for them so don't get them. The burger was good and bacon was flavorful. Overall not great!!!"}
{"text":"Black & Bleu Burger secret. This burger is one of my favorites. There is a trick though when ordering. If you are a real fan of blue cheese you need to ask for extra. If not you will have a hard time tasting any. 


Fun restaurant for Sun Prairie. Fun atmosphere. Great for watching sporting events."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We waited over 45 minutes and then the burgers were dry and the cheese curds tasted like they sat under a heat lamp for a long while."}
{"text":"First visit to this staple in the madison area. They promote their burgers as their food of choice and I now I know why. I ordered the black and Bleu burger and it was terrific. My wife isn't the biggest burger person so she went with grilled cheese and said it was amazing. We had a good sized group of about 10 people and they split us up with 2 waitresses which I thought was a great idea. After our orders were placed the food arrived promptly and still hot. I went with pub chips and those were very good too. The setting is really nice and there are plenty of TVs throughout to keep up on sports. The staff was really friendly and even though it was a Wednesday it was rather busy i would say 80 percent full and service was still great. The prices couldn't be beat either beer selection was great with good prices. We will be back no questions asked!"}
{"text":"My nephew and I went to the Nitty Gritty in Sun Prairie this afternoon and had an excellent time!!  I really liked the decor--big beautiful rustic wood, wide open spaces, lots of windows, cool booths, and lots of huge bigscreens!!  The best part of our experience was meeting our excellent bartender, Taylor.  She was fun, friendly, and helped us out by suggesting things we might like to try!!  So many choices!!  The cheese curds were great!  We will be back soon!! :)"}
{"text":"Nice patio. Plenty of seating. Peach brandy old fashioned is delicious! The quesadilla was also very good. Easy walk from main street, not too far away."}
{"text":"Boy, I don't know what happened to this place.  It was good like the other Gritty locations when it first opened.  It's definitely gone downhill.  Service is lacking - we had to wave at our server multiple times before hunting her down for a beer refill.  When we received our sandwiches, they were disgusting.  My grilled buffalo chicken sandwich had an unusual (bad) char taste to it and so did the bun.  It took several hours/beverages, etc before the char taste left my mouth.  There was no sauce on it and the side of ranch was missing.  My husband's medium Gritty burger also had the same weird burnt flavor to it and so did his bun.  We didn't advise the server of our issues since we needed to get going and didn't have time to wait for new orders.  We ordered chocolate milk and they must pour syrup in it and mix it up - this time, the milk was white and the syrup was clumped in the bottom.  We have noticed a decline in popularity of this restaurant - there are fewer people patronizing this place then when we've visited for lunch previously.  Bring back consistency and this place will do well again since Sun Prairie lacks all kinds of dining options."}
{"text":"Obviously a great place to go for your birthday since you drink for free, and it's pretty good for just going out any other night.  I had their signature burger (the Nitty burger) and it was good, but not great.  The burger seemed a little thin, which I wasn't expecting.  They have a pretty decent looking breakfast/brunch menu which I'm looking forward to trying.  I like getting their bloody marys, but the last time I had one here it was really bad.  I'm not sure what happened, but it tasted like straight tomato juice.  Usually it is flavorful and has a good bite to it.  I'll have to make sure I don't order one when the bartender that made this one is working...

The service is prompt and friendly, and I'm sure I'll be back.  Looking forward to trying the brunchzilla bloody mary, granted the right bartender is working."}
{"text":"Nitty Gritty has survived in its Sun Prairie location longer than its predecessor. This is such a great location in a historic building, the bar alone draws quite a crowd. 

As a food venue, Nitty Gritty is very average. The burgers are good. The menu isn't terribly creative and is getting a bit dated. Nitty Gritty may have to step up its game in light of some of the more upscale spots that have opened in Sun Prairie in recent years. 

Having said that, Nitty Gritty is a comfortable, family-friendly place to grab a burger and a beer. Sometimes the service is fantastic and sometimes it's quite horrible. That's just the way it is. Try the cheese curds, either yellow or white. They're good, too."}
{"text":"I like the Sun Prairie location, it has a nice calm vibe to it compared to some sports bars. Good place to watch football games.  Some of the bartenders are excellent and some are just ok.  I've never had anything bad from the good menu but I mostly go to have a beer or two, they have both craft and macro brews.  Family friendly as well.  Everyone seems to enjoy the birthday experience."}
{"text":"Would really like to give this place a better rating. We ordered two hamburgers and fries both were cooked well enough. We also had a cheese curd appetizer.  Only one squeaked out of the whole basket of cheese curds. We ordered one burger medium and one burger medium rare.  They both came medium. Overall an average burger and an average dining experience on the patio. Oh yeah, the music really sucked. I'm not sure what it is it's obvious Millennial blah blah."}
{"text":"Bar full of football fans and Nitty Gritty won't play the audio. Not cool!  Recommend going to Buffalo Wild Wings!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday supper.  Nitty Gritty gives the birthday person a birthday mug to fill with free tap beer or soda.  Unlimited refills.  I decided to order the Heartland Burger which is a grass fed beef burger with cheddar cheese and onion strings on a wheat bun. Tasty but the amount of bread in the wheat bun was too much and I had only half a bun with my burger.   The burger was incredibly tasty. I was able to substitute my normal side with a side of onion rings which were delicious as well. My husband made his own mushroom and swiss which was also great.   He substituted his side for cheese curds  which were absolutely delicious.  Our meal was topped off with a free two bite sundae.  What a great way to close a meal."}
{"text":"Big surprise, I came here to celebrate a ... birthday! Haha, Nitty Gritty is the bar to go to if you have a 21+ friend or family member with a birthday, because they drink free! We happened to be there the same day as a Packers game, and they had a ton of TVs not only in the bar, but in the dining room where we met for lunch.

They have booths for 2 and tables for large groups; from what I saw, the bar layout was pretty spacious. With snow still on the ground during our visit, I will need to stop back during the summer and drink out on their patio too.

It really is a place for all ages (if you stop in for lunch or dinner)... maybe not so much after 8pm when it feels more like a bar crowd. I saw children with balloons and celebrating with their family, but mostly college kids and older, there for their drinks. Not sure I'd frequent the bar outside of a birthday... luckily enough of my friends always choose the Nitty to at least start their night!"}
{"text":"I ordered a salad with chicken for lunch. When it came, it was hard to distinguish the tomatoes b/c they were so small and pale pink. Some of the lettuce was rotten. It took almost 30 minutes for our lunches to come out, and the place was not busy."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the breakfast/brunch menu. It's the best place in Sun Prairie for \"bar\" food like your burgers and appetizers. Great 4-6 happy hour 1/2 priced taps and apps special. Holds up well to the Nitty Gritty Gold standards. No clue what the idiots with low ratings were doing while they were here."}
{"text":"I returned to the Gritty with a friend. It was getting late on a Friday and we'd had a couple of beverages already. I called ahead to ask how late they served food (since the website gave me the times for the other locations but not for this one) and was told 11pm. Woo-hoo!! We scurried down there and managed to find very close street parking. 

I had the falafel burger and loved it (would eat another one right now if I had it). My friend had a burger and liked it a lot. The fries were also good. Right before 11 they started putting chairs on tables and sweeping, which is not the most welcoming thing to see, but I did understand that they didn't want to wait forever for us to finish up."}
{"text":"One of my relatives held an 80th birthday party for his parents.  For the cost of the meal, the banquet room should have been free.  Also, apparently the Nitty Gritty staff forgot to put out the coleslaw that was part of the food they paid for and also there was supposed to be a caesar salad.  There was a plain salad but no dressing was provided.  It was next to the burger toppings, so people were putting that on their salad...thinking that was the dressing. Not very tasty!  The people hosting the party didn't realize this until later.  

The service was good, though.  They were very friendly.  It would have been nice if they would have told everyone, though, that soda was included with their meals.  Another thing which was paid for but some just ordered water thinking they would have to pay for their beverage.

I have eaten here before and have really liked their food.  If I were to use their banquet room, though, I would bring a copy of the menu to the event to ensure everything is as it should be."}
{"text":"Seriously? We never go out for burgers, but we felt like checking out The Nitty Gritty tonight. We decided to sit outside because it was beautiful out. We had at least three different servers walk by us several times without uttering a word to us. Four other groups came in after us, were immediately attended to and served drinks. One server had to completely walk around us in order to get to the other tables. It was impossible to not see us. While we realize we probably weren't purposely ignored, it sure felt like we were. After 20 minutes (yes, we literally timed it) we walked out. We even decided to give them one last shot by talking to the host/hostess, but they were unapologetic and disinterested. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Three stars because I had some good times late night just drinking beer from a bottle with friends. I think it was more so the friends and the night not the Nitty Gritty. Won't go into the gory details on food and service we experienced two times I dined at the NG. It wouldn't be polite to the business to express my disgust with the service and poor food. Visit the bar for drinking though. The atmosphere is actually impressive. Nitty gritty is all what you make of it. To me, it's a bar. I get the impression they want to be a restaurant but no one I know or even based on my own personal experiences dining have enjoyed the food. It really is some nasty grub. Both in presentation and taste. Service is same. Our server (both times) looked and behaved like she was picked up off the side of the road and drug in to work. Dirty finger nails and bad hygiene. Other server we had looked hung over and scuzzy uzzy, not very good hygiene and scruffy tattooed appearance. Forgot to put one of our plates in and didn't really seem apologetic or caring. Good thing the drinks kept flowing. Poor food with poor service is not good. Uggh, I contradicted myself and said I would not go into gory details. Oh well, let's just say we noticed staff slapping eachother with menus and horsing around while we were still waiting on one of our plates that the kitchen was dragging to arrive at the table. I get it, mistakes happen. Horse play by 20 and 30 year olds is not a mistake. Server's thumb with dirty nails was touching our food too on second visit. 3 stars is overly generous. I'm a generous person, what can I say. I still tipped 20% for service that was totally unacceptable and sandwiches that were. ....don't even know how to explain. Bar food meets reasonable prices meets poor execution meets slop meets a 50lb bag of salt meets the back of a sysco truck meets run of the mill bar food meets another nitty gritty location."}
{"text":"I classify this venue as \"never underestimate the mediocre taste of the general public.\" Nice tap beer selection. Bring your own beer knowledge because the staff probably doesn't know to help you choose.  They seem to be \"order takers\", not front line hospitality and customer relations builders that get you repeat business from me. Lots of big TVs to watch a game. Spacious in a great historic building. My sandwich was served in a wicker basket- ew unsanitary. Birthdays are a big deal here. Fun if you are involved...annoying if you are not."}
{"text":"I came here for a colleagues birthday.  This place was pretty cool because apparently you drink for free if it's your birthday (they do actually check your ID). I ordered a burger with gritty sauce, cheddar, bacon, a fried egg and onions as my meal. Along with that I also had cheese curds. Overall it was a solid meal and I'd probably go back if someone suggested it to me."}
{"text":"Honestly, I think this restaurant's Sun Prairie location deserves a high rating for being possibly the best venue for going out with a group in Sun Prairie. When looking for a local place to meet friends for a drink and possibly a bite to eat, the Nitty Gritty is definitely at the top of my list for Sun Prairie bars.

I love that they are currently all decked out for Halloween. The bar/restaurant has a casual atmosphere and feels a bit less crowded than their downtown location. They also have plenty of TVs broadcasting sports, which makes it the perfect place to bring your dad who really needs to know what the score is.

One giant plus - the staff is incredible. Our server was super friendly and personable, and I got the impression that the rest of the staff is as well. They do a great job to make your experience fun. 

Extensive beer selection and well-made cocktails. The food is good, but not remarkable. All in all, the restaurant itself and drinks are what really make the place stand out."}
{"text":"Overall a tad disappointed I'd say. We were here in one of the private rooms for a friends birthday, a group of about 20 of us. The room itself felt a bit dark and dreary but had tv's and enough room for the appetizers to be put out on separate tables. The people hosting the party ordered waffle fries, cheese curds, wings, and sliders for us all to munch on. Out of the four the best were the burger sliders. The wings were \"extra crispy,\" aka cooked way too long and I personally don't think should have been brought out of the kitchen. I ordered the Olympus Salad to supplement and it was alright. Dressing was pretty good and unique but I was disappointed with the amount of chicken in it. Honestly not sure if I'm dying to come back although I do know they're known for their burgers. Maybe the downtown location is better?!"}
{"text":"This location was picked to get together with some friends. While it is stated with friendly people and is a nice enough facility, I did not find the food to be all that not worthy. Mind you there is nothing wrong with the food, I just find their burgers to be rather bland. 
I have been to this location on two separate occasions and both times I found their burgers to be rather lack luster. A little salt did help but I think they could be better right out of the kitchen.
Parking can be an issue on busy nights, an you may be required to walk a block or two.
They do have a very nice outside seating area for the warmer months. 
Overall the only reason I would return is because someone else chooses this location for another get together."}
{"text":"Good place to have some drinks and watch sporting events but would not recommend the food."}
{"text":"Went here with my Mom and Dad because it was Mom's birthday. I don't think very highly of this place. 

The building is very bland inside, there being no decor, and all brown with no signs of life inside. 

Our waitress was not attentive and we waited quite a bit for water and our order being taken. They need to focus on the customer and not just write down orders. Also this place is kind of costly.

I also would prefer my meal on a plate, not in a basket. The only reasons this did not get one star is you can use a coupon along with a free birthday burger coupon, and the burgers are great! On the other hand, the chips were flavorless, unless you put ketchup on them."}
{"text":"Read the list of less than flattering reviews but decided to give the place a chance for a birthday dinner.  Our food was very good comparable with all of the Gritty food we have had.  Big improvement to the restaurant that used to be in this location.  Glad to have them in Sun Prairie.  The service was very good!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Nitty several times for drinks as they are the \"Birthday Bar.\" However, this was my first trip for dinner.  Completely underwhelming. 

I ordered the Bruschetta Burger, cooked med. well with the house fries. My burger was cooked beyond well. To say it was dry would be an understatement. It had a single slice of mozzarella that had already started to firm up. This probably means by burger was sitting under the lights for a few minutes. The bruschetta of tomato and fresh basil was delicious. However, i was not given enough. With a burger that doesn't come with any mayo, this was the only wet component on an otherwise boring burger. 

I ordered a cup of chili, which was $3.75. It was the only way to get chili on my fries. If you order it on your fries, it is still $3.75. The chili was terrible. It is their seasonal soup and it tasted like it came straight from a can or a mix of chili seasonings. 

I usually go out to eat midweek because I do not feel like cooking. Honestly, I would have rather stayed home and ate frozen pizza. At least then I would have saved money and I knew that my food would be just ok."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner for my fiancé's birthday. Overall it was a good experience and I have no complaints. The service was pretty quick considering we had 10 people at our table. I ordered the strawberry & pistachio salad. It was really good with the raspberry vinigarette although it could have used more feta and strawberries on it."}
{"text":"If it is your birthday, what are you waiting for!!! Get to the Nitty and grab yourself some free drinks! 
This Nitty in particular has a great outside patio & plenty of parking.

If it is not your birthday, plan on only staying for less than an hour or you will be forced to listen to their birthday song that they plan once an hour. Followed by bell ringing and birthday names being read over a microphone. Yes, this happens every hour of the day.
So yeah, I'm pretty sure I can only deal with this every so often when it's not my birthday. 
The food is pretty good. Nothing special, just good bar food. The Big Gritty is my go to burger. It is huge! 2 giant patties and a tasty wheat bun covered in cheese, tomato, and onion with a pickle spear.
If you get the cheese curds, they come with Gritty sauce. Not to my liking so I order ranch instead. It's kind of like a strange thousand island sauce. the curds themselves are fantastic! Nicely battered and decently sized.
The milk shakes are my favorite! They not only bring you a nice large glass cup covered in whip cream, but also the very large metal cup that they made it blended it in. So it's like have 2 shakes sitting in front of you!!!! Yum Yum."}
{"text":"Appreciated the free beer on my bday. Wait staff and kitchen may have had an off day. Fun environment."}
{"text":"We go here for all of our birthdays (yay birthday club!!).  The nacho plate's my fav.  The bartenders are nice, although one time one of them was showing a little too much interest in my date. lol  I forgave her--he's pretty, after all. 

I prefer to come here in the warmer weather and sit outside--the patio is really nice and there are nice big TVs, too, if you're into watching the game.

The parking lot can be crowded, sometimes you have to park on the street. The bartenders are great about changing the music if it sucks, too. The bathroom is well-kept.  I'm comfortable here."}
{"text":"I can vouch for friendly staff, good cocktails and a decent beer list -- but unfortunately I'm on the bandwagon that hopes the iconic Gritty hires some quality kitchen staff and soon. You shouldn't have to make excuses for the bad food, friendly manager guy! And really, there is no explaining bad brats and curds; it's Wisconsin for cripes sakes. Marsh would be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Fun evening at The \"Gritty\" - 1st visit to the Sun Prairie location since they took over and remodeled from the old \"Cannery\".  We made reservations but chose to sit in the bar - staff and hostess were accommodating .  We celebrated a 49th birthday and the birthday boy had fun.  Food and beverages were excellent for bar food.  I had the Sheboygan Style Double Brat sandwich with kraut & fries - it was a flavorful, grilled, pair of brats served with kraut and a thinly sliced, grilled onion.  She had a special request - a reuben without the corned beef - her request was accommodated with ease and it was delicious.  The table also had cheese curds, A \"Gritty Burger\", a \"Pretzel Bender burger\", a Bacon/ Chicken wrap, and a grilled salmon fillet - all were tasty and served efficiently by Angie.  Things got a little confusing with the bills, but it all worked and we had a nice time and felt the crew at the \"Gritty\" were welcoming, enthusiastic, and sharing their Wisconsin hospitality.  Whether you're celebrating a birthday or just enjoying a casual evening out with friends or family - \"The Gritty\" is sure to deliver - stop by and give 'em a visit."}
{"text":"We visited the Sun Prairie Gritty today for the first time.   We did have a party of 8 including 3 young boys but it was not a birthday party.   The restaurant was about half full.   Overall the food was boring when it wasn't downright poor.   I had a taste for a bratwurst but what I was served was an awful excuse.   My wife's Gritty burger was OK though served cool.   There may have been a problem in the kitchen as it took nearly 30 minutes for our order to arrive.   I would not return to this Gritty and would have reservations about visiting the venerable downtown Gritty...hopefully that hasn't sunk to this level.   Marsh?"}
{"text":"A solid 3 because we never know how things will turn out when we go. Service levels run the gambit, last night was a win. The up charge from fries to veggies caught us off guard but things like are certainly not unique to the Gritty. BBQ wrap was good but lacked pizazz and hubby unfortunately had another failure in his brisket tour of the greater Madison area. It was fatty, tough & flavorless. He'll go back to the burgers which are hit or miss. Fried cheese curds always good but it's hard to go wrong with fried cheese."}
{"text":"How this place wins best burger is beyond me.  Go for the cheap beer, college vibe and drunk co-eds.  I have no idea why anyone would go for the food."}
{"text":"The building that houses the Nitty Gritty is absolutely beautiful.  Exposed brick walls, high ceilings, and a great patio to spend a summer night on.  While I am not a big fan of their food, I have to give them credit as they have been churning out the same menu (with a few changes) since I can remember.  Maybe 25 years ago, the gritty sauce was something to talk about but other restaurants are constantly pushing the envelope on bringing new tastes and flavors to the marketplace.  The Gritty appears to be stuck.  Not necessarily a bad thing but not something I would come back to time and time again."}
{"text":"Been in Madison for years, have enjoyed the Gritty downtown during the Marsh years and more recently, a few get togethers at the Middleton location.

Just finished a rehearsal dinner for my sons wedding at the Sun Prairie location. This latest addition and new to me NG was great. Food, service and atmosphere. 

A special thanks to Jesse and Stephanie for making our night even better.

Drinks, dinner or special event, their crew will not disappoint. Check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We live in East Madison, and usually frequent this location for family birthdays. It's easier parking that the downtown location. Our server was on top of everything tonight and had great humor with my Dad (it was his birthday). He got his birthday mug and had several refills of Spotted Cow (for free). They also brought him a cute mini-sundae because it was his birthday. It's obvious, but make sure you bring your Driver's License or another proof of age. Our food was good, we used a Bucky Book coupon for buy 1, get 1 burger and then I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch Wrap. I loved the Chicken Bacon Ranch Wrap. My only suggestion for improvement would be to make it less liquefied- it was challenging to dip. Beautiful historical building and good parking availability."}
{"text":"This place needs a revamp, starting with reading and responding to their Yelpers. It's overrated, dirty and overpriced. 

Terrible service. Miranda was our server. She was slow and condescending. There were several mistakes on my bacon cheeseburger - they messed up a bacon cheeseburger. Miranda didn't like that after ignoring us, I called her by name as she ran past our table for the 10th time to come back to our table & asked for a refill of soda & water with little ice. So she leaned in, bent down and explained to me (with visuals) how she always  trains her so staff to fill cups with ice to the top and she was now going to have the redo my soda to my \"liking.\" 

The bathrooms were a mess. No paper towels, trash on floor. Piss on the toilet. The parking situation is ridiculous. 

One positive note: the hostesses were very friendly."}
{"text":"I was very dissatisfied with our experience. We decided to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday here because it supposed to be a great birthday restaurant...ok. He did get a free Diet Coke, and mug to go with it...but we were forgotten once seated, appetizer never came out, and our server was hilarious when he asked if I wanted a free 'sundae'..it's literally a bite...he actually said because we waited so long, he wouldn't charge me for it.
We didn't bother to complain, we just won't return."}
{"text":"Stopped in here randomly when looking for a sports bar in the Sun Prairie area.  We grabbed a table in the large bar area, the waitresses were friendly and quick with the beers... but, we didn't know that they marketed themselves as the \"official birthday bar\", so be prepared to be asked several times who is celebrating a birthday in your group and some initial confusion from hostess & waitress if you're not celebrating  (as if to think somebody would just come here for just a beer!).  You will also be inundated with birthday announcements, singing, etc. over the loudspeaker.. so if you don't enjoy watching others celebrate birthdays or you're not celebrating one yourself, you may just want to make this one a quick 1-beer stop like we did."}
{"text":"My meal was rather disappointing.  The medium burger was cooked rare, requested the hard roll bun, but it came with the standard honey bun.  Menu has nice variety and atmosphere is neat change from standard chains.  For the price you need to at least match Culvers in quality of burger."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. Sometimes it's good. Sometimes it's meh. Inconsistent. Burgers are about $2 over priced."}
{"text":"Decent birthday bar/restaurant. Ive been here a few times. Twice on my birthday where it was free drinks for me, the birthday guest. I would rate it a 3.5 if I could. The food is decent. I suggest making it a stop for your birthday for at least a few free drinks. I admit its quit entertaining sitting at the bar where they tie a balloon to the wrist of the birthday guests. I met a lot of people born on my birthday."}
{"text":"WHY is this place a Madison area tradition?!?! Ugh. My goodness. 

Despite the fact that I grew up in the Madison area, my trip to the Sun Prairie Nitty Gritty was the first time I've been inside one of these establishments. I was there with family to celebrate my brother's 15th birthday. We were a party of 6 and we came for dinner on a Wednesday night around 5:30.

Pros - the atmosphere was fun - lots of TV screens, a decent sized mid week crowd, but not too noisy. Everything was very clean and well decorated. The menu is extensive, and I appreciate that gluten free buns and cider options were available. Our server was decently attentive, and the food came out very quickly. All of these things are great.

Cons - seriously, what is with this food? I ordered the bruschetta burger basket. It comes in a small black wicker basket - that is too deep to eat from comfortably. The portion of fries was minuscule, and lukewarm at best. The fires were the best part. It should have been a warning sign when our server didn't ask me how I wanted my burger done (I ordered it medium rare anyway). This burger...if you've ever had a warmed up, previously frozen, high school cafeteria grade hamburger, this is exactly the experience. Thin, strangely textured, oddly chewy, and completely tasteless. The \"fresh tomatoes and basil\" were a smear of goo on the bottom bun, and the mozzarella was a translucent piece of processed \"cheese\". Just...no. Also, my gluten free bun was hard as a stone and basically inedible. I buy this brand of buns all the time (Udi's), and they are pretty good, so I have no idea what happened here.

Also, my little bro's \"free birthday sundae\" was the size of a shot glass.

I guess if you want to go watch a game, eat fairly ok fries, and drink cheap beer (there are lots of miller specials), this is a great place. If you want a palatable dinner...keep driving."}
{"text":"Great for vegetarians! You wouldn't think this would be a good stop on your list considering it's all burgers. But this is a great place for Omnivores and Herbivores alike. I suggest the best experience would be to stop in on a Tuesday night with friends for a few drinks and TRIVIA NIGHT. 

The atmosphere here is quieter than the Madison location. But the drink deals are just as good. Food was above average quality. Bartender was knowledgeable and quick. The pricing is your typical sit-down pricing. I would say it was a little expensive for burgers and fries, but like I said - the quality was above average for your typical burger place.

My one critique was that the service wasn't great, considering we all ran out of water when we were sitting there for 2 hours or so (playing trivia of course). 

Also quick shout out to the helpful host that helped us get our cars back after we left it overnight!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for brunch to watch the game, and the place wasnt too busy. We ended up waiting for at least 10 minutes without anyone coming to the table so I asked the hostess where our server was. When our server finally came to take our order, we waited another 10 minutes before we even got a cup of coffee, but no waters or silverware. There were 3 hostessess standing by the door and at least 3 servers that I noticed serving the tables around us, so I dont know what our waitresses issue was."}
{"text":"We went last night to celebrate grandmas 86th birthday. I had the gyro burger special which was very good. Grandma was thrilled with her birthday mug of Sierra mist. Our server Meghan was friendly and cheery."}
{"text":"We headed out east to hit the Sun Prairie location for a fantasy football draft.  As expected, the experience there was much like the other Grittys we know and love.  BUT, Sun Prairie seems to have a little more to offer than others...

For our draft, we got the party room.  We had 10 guys, but the room could have easily held 20 or 30.  Maybe more - I didn't count.  The free WiFi was a bonus.  Having the separate room was nice - we could relax and have fun without feeling like we were disturbing other patrons.  They also have a much larger room for bigger events - something to consider if you need a large event space.

An extra bonus was their beer selection - many more choices than the west side establishment.  Being my birthday, I was obligated to have a few free taps with my mug.  They had Lake Louie Warped Speed on tap - game over!  I'm sure they had other beers, but that's my favorite.

Our server was spunky and fun - perfect for our group.  She gaffed a few things with our party, but it wasn't anything we couldn't straighten out.  She was attentive and stayed on top of our situation.  Very well done.

We got the happy hour special of \"half price apps and taps\" for our draft.  The food was fresh and tasty.  It'll be hard to find another place to draft at that has more to offer."}
{"text":"The Sun Prairie Nitty Gritty is a fun and friendly environment.  I was there for a trivia competition last weekend.  I love that the Nitty serves Brunch.  I had the Sunrise Burger, waffle fries, and Leinie's Vanilla Porter.  But it was good to know I could have had pancakes or other breakfast-y items if I wanted too.

Nice servers, friendly bartenders, and good cooks in the kitchen.  My brother lives near by so I know I will be back again."}
{"text":"I love the selection of beers.  The burgers rock!  Groups of friends having a great time.  I was with a couple of ladies, who had never been there.  Of course, they were all over me, but not obnoxious.  The drinks were flowing and everything was going great, then Hank walked in.  I don't think he was intoxicated, but there was something weird about him.  I followed him into the men's room, where he was being very loud standing at the urinal.  It sounded like he was passing a kidney stone.  I recommend Nitty Gritty.  I do not recommend Hank.  #teammrbo"}
{"text":"Great burgers, wonderful atmosphere.  Service is a plus compared to what was here before.   We are regular customers now.  Soooo glad Sun Prairie has one now."}
{"text":"I've been eating at the Nitty since I was a kid.  I've never had a bad experience.  Not once.  I'm thrilled one opened in Sun Prairie because I don't live near the West Side and getting downtown is a pain.  The only problem with the one in SP is the parking.  There's a lot behind the place, but it's mostly for the renters in the Cannery apartments.  You have to park sort of across the street.  It will be a little confusing your first time there."}
{"text":"The Nitty Gritty is a go-to place for birthdays and not much else. If it is your birthday- it's totally worth it to come here. The food is not very unique (burgers, salads, etc) but still good none the less. You get a free drink mug on your birthday as well as a free little dessert which is kinda fun. However, if it's not your birthday, this place really isn't anything too special that I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon with my husband and cousin. Parking was confusing since there isn't a parking lot and the street parking was full. We all ordered simple vodka diet 7s for our drinks and they had a yucky vanilla taste. For lunch we all tried different burgers and they were all really bland. Not one of us finished ours. The only thing I liked was the waffle fries. Wouldn't recommend stopping in. I feel I'm being nice with two stars."}
{"text":"Someone please get this place out of SP. Except the unlimited drinks on the B day. That can stay."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers and birthdays! Great place to watch the game as well. At times the floors are a little sticky and the servers aren't always in the best mood. They made a pretty good old fashioned though. The brunch is fun with some different sandwiches and some decent bloody Mary's. Their outdoor patio is pretty nice in the summer as well. Would recommend to anyone that's having a birthday or looking to watch the big game!"}
