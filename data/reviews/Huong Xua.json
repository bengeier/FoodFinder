{"text":"Happy to find a good little place like this in Anjou. Very good food. We had soups and an appetizer of spring rolls. Flavorful soups with lots of noodles and meat. All very good. I was spying on other peoples plates and everything looked so good.
The only bad thing was that it was SO LOUD. We almost had to scream at each other to be heard. I hope its not like that all the time. Parking is pretty bad also. Still looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Montreal ! With very nice decoration and good services. The owner and staff are polite, prompt, and knowledgeable.

The name  Huong Xua means 'Aroma of Yesteryears', and indeed, this charming restaurant does bring back the cullinary scents, taste,  and texture of Vietnamese dishes like they were in the old days.

I visited Huong Xua in April with a few friends and we all agreed the dishes are just as they were back in Vietnam. We ordered the popular family dishes Cá Kho Tô  (Basa fish stewed in fish sauce), Canh Chua  (Basa fish in Tamarind soup), and Cm Tay Cm  (Crispy rice, baked in a clay pot, with shrimp). The dishes were served perfectly hot. The portions were generous. And the taste was wonderful. 

The Canh Chua was like a grand symphony of aroma and taste: sweetness of broth and pineapple, tanginess of tamarind and tomato, pungency of fresh chili pepper, crunchiness of celery slices and bean sprouts, ... Not to mentioned the slimy okra slices, perfectly cooked (not too soft, not too raw), and those spongy taro-stem slices (Bc-Hà), and the fish !

The Cm Tay Cm has the perfect texture: rice surface is golden brown, very crispy. On top were fresh shrimp, diced onion, bamboo shoot, mushroom, green and red sweet pepper, all sautéd to perfection.

I came back last week for a take-out of Fish in Tamarind Soup, and the Crispy Rice. They were properly packed so that re-heating can be done without loosing the taste or texture. And yes, they were as good as in yesteryears !!!

Bon appetit !"}
{"text":"Rare do we get authentic Vietnamese cuisine in the east end of Montreal.

This is the go to place when we want to eat some Vietnamese food so my mother doesn't have to cook for the whole family.

I did hesitate between giving a 4 or 5 but I did recommend this restaurant to my Caucasian friends and they absolutely loved it and I think it deserves its 5/5.

A background of vietnamese music will play while you eat. You'll probably also get to see vietnamese customers order different items than what you have ordered! You can ask for extra piment on the side, and it's spicy as wished. My favourite is their canh chua aka aigre-douce soup!

So far this is the best vietnamese restaurant in east end of montreal !!"}
