{"text":"So I finally made it down to the Sunterra Village Marche on \"Butter Chicken Day\" at the Big Pan counter. Turns out it's every Thursday, but I seem to go there every other day of the week.  And after all that waiting, it was just ok.  They claim \"World Famous\" status on their Butter Chicken, and I have to admit, the chicken and butter sauce were very good. The two problems were the starches - the dry flavoured rice underneath which only served to soak up my precious sauce, and the terrible naan bread, which more closely resembled undercooked bannock than naan, and it was cold and stiff. yuck.  If there's any way to get the Butter Chicken on its own, then pick it up for dinner and go to one of the many Middle Eastern bakeries to pick up fresh, real naan to go with it!"}
{"text":"I bought a Mac and Cheese at lunch today, Friday Sept 18, 2015 - the pasta special. This was not the creamy comfort food I was looking for.This was macaroni with seasoned bread crumbs, a lot of oil and a sprinkling of cheese. Mine was seriously over baked."}
{"text":"Just went for a coffee and cinnamon bun this morning.  Never disappointed when I come here.  Good value for what you pay and they quality of the food.  Also took a sandwich to go for lunch.  Any of their sandwiches on the pumpernickel bread are awesome.  Chicken salad was delicious!  My only peeve was that they only had one cashier open.  It was 10am and a bunch of people were there for a coffee break and they only had one cashier open?  The line up was 10-15 people deep.  Otherwise, no complaints."}
{"text":"Although it's been awhile since being downtown, I always had a pretty decent experience at this Sunterra, despite their prices being higher than other options.  Unfortunately this place has changed for the worse! I grabbed a bowl of cream of broccoli soup to go but didn't notice until I was back at my desk that it was grey and lumpy with no hint of green or broccoli!  Looked so gross in the Styrofoam bowl.  I dared to taste it and regretted it immediately!  It had way too much oregano (who puts oregano in broccoli soup? yuck).  Pitched it in the garbage and went to Tim Horton's in the Bow building."}
{"text":"Update: I always order from the grill section and the last couple of times, it's been a disaster. The main problem is that they always have new staff who are not familiar with the items on the menu much less how to prepare them. The shame is that they are left alone without a more experienced supervisor guiding them through."}
{"text":"I gave up on lunching here after many many failed experiments.   They've never heard of salt, herbs or seasoning in general, all their veggies are undercooked and hard, no matter the dish. The soups are barely edible, and the entrees are NOT, frankly. The sandwiches are a good value, although completely generic. The salads are all gross, either over or under-seasoned and manage to be oily and bland at the same time.   If pressed to eat there I tend to get a slice of prime rib (which I can add salt to separately), with a side that I know to be okay. The only time to go there is either breakfast - for decent but generic muffins and croissants, or after work to pick up a slab of raw meat for dinner.   Perhaps they once used to be about high quality, but these days I'm very disappointed. I know nothing about their farm since their website does not choose to enlighten me about HOW exactly the animals are raised. Are they free-range? hormone free? humanely treated? I know nothing about the provenance of any of their food, and their high prices and strictly average quality of offerings leave me completely unimpressed."}
{"text":"Lots of selection and yummy lunch items...There was a couple things that I didn't like though that stood out to me:  1. The set up and location of the salad bar.  I found it to be very crowded and hard to find the line/move in the line without people running into each other, also you're constantly in the way of the checkout lines. 2. The items are kind of just out in the open and since the tongs are very short people have to reach in and grab them while accidently touching the food with their hands... the spinach/mixed greens does have a cover but it is the worst since the tongs are so short that you cannot avoid touching the greens just to the tongs out.... It seems unsanitary and I was turned off of the spinach after seeing someone grab leafs in their hand and letting the leafs drop back into the container after getting ahold of the tongs.  I'll go back for sure, just probably going to stear clear of that salad bar and try another elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best pork in the west.  Seriously, they ship most of it directly to Japan!  What the heck!  Eat it while you can, folks!  And don't skip the bacon, it's from Valbella Meats in Canmore.  Wild Boar Pate = tres awesome!  Sunterra, you've made me love apple juice again."}
{"text":"I do love Sunterra, I sometimes question the quality. Based on where I'm working downtown this has been a Sunterra that I have gone to a fair amount. Reason I started going was something a little healthier for lunch.   First I think the prices are pretty ridiculous here, and my next complaint is their false advertisement for gluten free. I actually got into with a chef there, as they advertised all their soups to be GF. And I asked him how it was possible for beef barely soup to be GF. Which he was unable to answer. So now I only get the salad bar there, as that is all I feel safe eating."}
{"text":"So there was this one time when I visited during the morning for breakfast.  Saw this guy cooking a bunch of mushroom on a huge pan. Cool.  And then, he put the cooked mushrooms into a produce box. Where the raw mushrooms used to be stored. So yah. Lots of soil on the bottom of the box.  A mountain of cooked mushroom stored in a dirty, produce box. Don't be surprised if you have cardboard box in your food.  Don't go to this sunterra, it is nasty and it is not sanitary!"}
{"text":"Popular daytime takeout spot for those working in the downtown core. This Sunterra has: -  salad bar  - pizza station - a couple hot food stations that rotate menus daily - bakery - juice bar - grab and go items  My favourite is the wood fired pizzas. As well, the bakery is pretty good about putting out samples throughout the day. So if you want a single bite of banana bread or cookie, it doesn't hurt to swing by."}
{"text":"This location used to be good a long time ago, but the food quality has gone downhill over the past 2-3 years and the staff is unpleasant.  Sometimes it smells of rotten lettuce, so I question the freshness of the produce in the salad bar.  The scones and fresh squeezed juice are probably the only good thing left here."}
{"text":"I have been in this place many many times as it's pretty close to where I work. I have tried their Salad Bar many times and to be honest I love it compared to other places nearby providing Salad Bar; consistency is always there.  They also have lots of options for Sandwiches as well as fresh juices. I know they also sell Pizza/soup and some main dishes prepared fresh. You can also get your Starbucks coffee and some dessert items in here:) It is always packed during lunch hour. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I used to work by this Sunterra. Over time I wondered how I was spending so much money on lunch. One day I realized: I could not escape from the call of the salad bar!  I would like to compose an ode to said salad bar, but unfortunately my poetry prowess is suffering without a delightful selection of fresh vegetables, toppings and dressings. Would I first discuss the crisp, perfect veggies or  the four cheeses that could cover them? Or the proteins in the forms of beans and chickens, or the seven different freshly made dressings? I spent a lot of time at this salad bar. Too much time, maybe.   I guess there were other things in this Sunterra, but the salad bar is right at the entrance so my mind always got a little cloudy. The freshly made sandwiches were delicious, of course, as were the soups. My favourite day was club sandwich day. The stews/butter chicken that they made were usually good for a hearty meal... I love Sunterra for the market, and the fresh made foods. Some are delicious... the pizza, the pasta, the crepes, and others are less so.   But the salad bar man. I still dream about that thing."}
{"text":"This Sunterra compared to the one in Bankers Hall is absolutely huge; this is a great stop in for lunch time simply for the space.  There are two floors here so not only can you buys things to go you can also take advantage of inside dining.  The second floor is so nice you can really relax and enjoy the views of downtown Calgary and a park.  During the lunchtime mad rush, there are several Sunterra employees stationed throughout the market with free taste tasting opportunities. The portions are not piddley so you could actually fill yourself with just the tasters alone.  Expect by weight pricing, so be careful don't misunderstand that the strip of salmon is only $3.00 rather it is $3.00 per whatever gram weight.  For food selection this is the perfect place to come, if you don't know what you are feeling like for lunch, because of all the visuals and free tasting I can assure you that you will eventually know what your stomach is growling for."}
{"text":"Took quite some effort and finally found this place. I do like it. It has everything from Juice bars, bread to cookies and salad. Just everything that you need. So walked from the Bow to the TransCanada building through the plus 15 and I smelled the food and followed it. Yes finally found Sunterra. This is awesome.   I got a double chocolate cookie and I have to say it was really good. Everything is fresh made. Love it. The place can be busy especially during lunch time.   Also friendly services."}
{"text":"This Sunterra has everything you need.  Paninis?  Sure. Breakfast items?  Definitely. Beer?  Why not.  I'm a huge fan of their Chocolate Banana Bread, especially when it comes out fresh in the morning.  For $1.59, it's a steal.  Their pizzas are just as amazing. Highly reco the pesto chicken pizza.  Just a warning that this place is a zoo during the lunch rush so come either at 11:45am or after 1pm to avoid the madness."}
{"text":"Not a bad lunch spot when I am in town at the Bow.   Sunterra is a bustling \"cafeteria\" of sorts, where you find your station of choice (salad, sandwich, soup, pizza, etc...) and you order, then carry everything to tiny payment kiosk, then try to find a table (or take the stuff to go elsewhere...).  I have to say I was pretty disoriented when I walked in- so many options!  I tried sliced pork served with rice and spinach and it was pretty good.  My lunch friend's pizza looked excellent!  We were out of the office and back in 40 minutes.  Quick, Easy, Diverse."}
{"text":"This Sunterra location had a lot more to offer than I expected. Besides the salad bar and pasta, crepe and other hot stations, there were also grab-and-go sandwiches, salads, fruit salads, and grocery items like vacuum-packed deli meats. Fresh juices, whole fruits, gourmet chocolate bars, alternative chips, and other snacks help round out quick and filling meals.  There are lots of cashiers spread out evenly, so if you find yourself in a snaking queue, just go moving. This place fills up quick over the lunch hour with office workers from neighbouring towers. I like to take my food to go, but if you elect to sit and eat in, there are plenty of tables beyond the cashiers in the back."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Sunterra.  We shared a building for 4 years and I made myself sick of it.  So why do I keep going back you ask?  Because of the fresh ingredients, delicious flavour combinations, and amazing service.    Did I mention it has everything under the sun?  Want some cheese and crackers at 230 pm? They've got it! How about a smoothie? Some Starbucks Coffee? Yep, they've got that too. Thai Pizza Wednesdays? How about butter chicken Thursdays? Yep and Yep and here's a Zantac to ease your heartburn deliciousness.  The staff is always very friendly and you never have to wait more than a couple of minutes to be served.  There are cashiers everywhere! Salad bar anyone? Feeling crappy after eating wings and beer?  Fill up on some greens and fruits and veggies!  When you end up weighing it it's usually pretty expensive, but you know what? You made it, and you made it delicious.    The moral of the story is: if you work near a Sunterra or live near a Sunterra, GO TO SUNTERRA!!!!"}
{"text":"Sunterra Market is such a neat little place to eat and do a little grocery shopping, if necessary.  They have so many different meals and dishes to choose from that you never have to order the same thing twice.  What's great about Sunterra is that each day offers a different special in each section.  They have different pasta each day, different pizza, different everything!  They even have traditional French crepes available for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a little snack.  Talk about scrumptious!  It's so refreshing knowing that you can stop by Sunterra when you really don't know what you want for lunch and find something amazing!  They also offer freshly prepared soups, sandwiches and salads from their in-store deli, as well as a humongous salad bar with all the fixings to make a unique salad.  Since the make-your-own salads are priced by weight, the cost can sometimes be a little high, especially if you're putting heavy stuff in the salad like water chestnuts or strawberries.  The brilliant thing about the salad bar is that if you want a fruit salad, just don't put any veggies in and Voila, a delicious fruit salad!  Another very interesting thing about this location is that they also offer cooking classes for those that are interested.  You can even book your own private cooking class!  In addition to the classes another great thing about Sunterra is the gift baskets and gift certificates they offer.  I don't think I'd be too upset if I received a gift card from Sunterra as a present.    This place is so unique and delightful.  I recommend stopping by for a quick lunch if you're in the downtown area!  Say yes to fresh, locally grown, delicious food!"}
{"text":"The only thing this page is missing is some photos (as of March 14th, 2011) but I can honestly say, from a visual standpoint this is one of the most stunning deli-cafes I've ever seen. This particular Sunterra Market is along a +15 between two downtown office towers, in one of which I used to work, and one day I talked my hubby into coming there with me for a \"date\".  There are what seems like miles' worth of mini bistros, food kiosks, etc. and the thing that makes it interesting is you don't pay at the ordering windows. but rather--just before you start eating--you take the meal, and any extras you grabbed, to one of the cashiers set up there and after that you're free to sit anywhere within, and take in the splendid view of \"a little Italy\" while you eat.   Just a fair warning: their quality wooden trays are a little heavy at first, if you're used to carrying lightweight plastic trays so don't drop your food :P  Cheers!"}
