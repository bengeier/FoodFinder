{"text":"I like The Firefly. Lots of space to work or hang out. But here's the catch. It's not clean. They really need to get their act together. Bathrooms are a bit icky and the tables and floors frequently have food on them. Simple concept....clean every day. And some of the young girls working here need an attitude adjustment....stop the feeling entitled routine and get some manners."}
{"text":"Little Oregon is fortunate to have a hip coffee joint like this, right in the middle of the downtown. I don't live there and have only visited once, but I could easily see Firefly as being an integral part of the town fabric. It's one of the bigger coffee houses I've ever been to: spacious, bordering on cavernous. The usual assortment of eclectic/thrift furniture and for-sale art by local artists. There's even a small play area with toys for kids. The coffee's great (from Kickapoo Coffee in Viroqua) and there's a pretty good menu, including sandwiches and lunch items, though the selection of baked goods was a little meager when I visited. Definitely a place to check out if you're passing through town."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Friendly staff. I didn't try the pastries but they had a wide selection. Lots of tables for working or talking. I was on my way back from an early morning delivery so it was nice to find a local place open before 7."}
{"text":"This is such a nice place with great service, drinks, and food! I love the variety on their menu. They also have lots of cozy sitting and work areas. The local art, weekly groups, and fireplace are all bonuses!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great ambience, good sandwiches, free Internet, Board Games, various comfy seating arrangements, books available. delicious Mexican Hot  Chocolate!..on the down side, short hours of operation, ie. closes too early"}
{"text":"The Firefly is a great place to sit and relax on a winter evening. They serve lunch and that is very good. I have not tried all their different coffee choices, but I do like their tea. It is a nice relaxing place with an local artist's work displayed on the walls."}
{"text":"Good (albeit limited) paninis and bakery items.  We  the coconut curry soup!  Be sure to check their website for daily soup specials.   Cute nooks and crannies for you to sip your coffee or get lost in a book!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried a lot of the food here but the coffee drinks are superb. I have had the \"rabbit\" breakfast bagel which must be great because I order it every time! It has cream cheese, shredded carrot, tomato, and cucumber. That along with a coffee and a book...I'm in coffee shop heaven.  The atmosphere is my favorite part. They call it Oregon's living room and it really is. It's a HUGE living room as they expanded a few years back. Lots of comfy couches and chairs along with some regular style tables/chairs for the working/laptop crowd. They also have a nice play area for younger children. My kids love going there for that and, oh yeah, the baked goods which are AMAZING. If you need a meeting space they have that too and I believe it's free to use as long as you're a buying customer (I'm not 100% sure on that).  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good. Long wait times and it seem s they try to run their business pretty lean. Amazing smoothies and my husband loves their granola protein bars."}
{"text":"An Oregon Establishment. Pretty sure it's a right of passage to put your punch card in the rotary deck.   Huge coffeehouse, with a lot of attention to detail in the decor and layout. It fills up fast during the day, but I've never been left without a table. They even have a back kid space and a bulletin area for kids to display work.   The Kickapoo Roasters coffee is sublime, likewise with the paninis.   Next up on my roster: the famous granola bar"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to go when in Oregon. They have delicious coffee, tea and food. You can go in with your kiddos if you wanted, they have some toys to keep them entertained. My co-workers goes there all the time and she loves Natalie, and says she is the best barista at the coffeehouse. I love getting iced coffee drinks from here but i make sure that they use one less shot of espresso, they make them pretty strong but it's great when you need a little pick me up. If in the area definitely go in and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went back three times in the past month and my experience mirrors that of other people. My previous reviews with concerns over the men's bathroom and General stickiness seem to no longer be a problem."}
{"text":"Great place, great coffees, great staff. Oregon needed a place like this!"}
{"text":"So love this place!  Haven't tried food yet, but have heard it is fantastic.  My latte was so tasty!  The building is spacious.  Tables or couches...you pick (and so many choices)!  They also seem to have a child play area that reasonably sized.   Local Kickapoo coffee is the grind used.  Don't go, I want to have my choice of seats!  :)"}
{"text":"Favorite coffee shop in the Madison and surrounding area! Great coffee and ambiance. I love going there with a good book, sitting on a couch and hanging out for a while!"}
{"text":"My second home :) love the friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. Great drinks, food, and bakery."}
{"text":"Great place! Very cozy and comforting, the service and staff are always nice! It's a very family friendly place that is always buzzing with people of all ages. My only complaint is the rather small selection of coffees. All of which seem to be a powdered pre-made mix"}
{"text":"Honestly this is the second time I unexpectedly found myself stopping into this place & being delightfully bowled over by the feeling of open space & privacy, the  delicious food options (homemade soup, sandwiches, & cookies plus my favorite natural soda selections), the ease of parking &, last but not least, the friendly service. My only regret is that I didn't have room for a coffee. But I do recall the first time I was there the coffee was outstanding. As for the bathrooms, I did not use them so I can't comment as to whether they were up to snuff. If I lived in Oregon I would probably make my second living room in this cafe. It totally feels like home...only more relaxed & I didn't have to lift a finger except to bus my table! Love the shared library concept and small gift items for sale as well."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee! Large coffee house with delicious breakfast and lunch fare.  Plenty of room to bring all of your friends to hang out or have a group meeting. Yesterday I picked up a delectable BLT to go.  The staff was super friendly, courteous and my sandwich was made to order.  Bacon was cooked just right and the \"lettuce\" was crispy arugula.   I haven't heard anyone say a bad thing about this place. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Nice place for a small town. The coffee has an interesting taste."}
{"text":"I love Firefly and am thrilled they have a niche in Oregon. The food and drinks are great as is the ambiance. It is a terrific place for working, reading, socializing, or just hanging out. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was in high school and I always try to go here when I'm home to visit my parents.  It has grown so much as it has a lot of space and it makes a great meeting spot ora place just to sit and relax.  They have a great list of different drinks. My favorite is the White Zombie.  There is a food menu but I don't think I ever had the food there. I'm glad this coffee shop is still in Oregon. It has lasted a lot longer than some of the other local businesses."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop!  I've always liked the Firefly because they had great service and a nice space.  They now serve Kickapoo coffee which means they get 5 stars!  Kickapoo coffee is the best--organic and fair trade.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Met here for buisness meeting. Service is great, atmosphere is great and coffie was very good. Nive place to sit and chat while enjoying some good coffie. I have not tried food yet but I will."}
{"text":"As coffee shops go, this is a great place to come relax and get an amazing cup of coffee.  The space is great for large groups, it is entertaining to bring the kids and not feel like you are disrupting other people's peace.    I love their community involvement with the running club and hosting local artists to display pieces there.  Just a great coffee experience"}
{"text":"This place is bananas. I've never had such consistently excellent food, drinks and service from any place of business. I'm so happy I work in Oregon otherwise I may have never found this place.   My favorite sandwich is the Veg Out which is a variety of vegetables on your choice of bread with an herbed mayo and provolone cheese. I like this place for vegetarian options because they include more vegetables than most on their sandwiches.   Drinks are delicious. I stop here most morning before work for an iced latte or a specialty drink which rotates every few weeks.   Their baked goods could have their own bakery. The \"world's best granola bars\" are literally the best in the world, and they're made in house. The coffee cake is perfectly textured and has the yummiest crumble topping, scones are great and flavors rotate often, cookies and muffins are delicious as well.   I have never had an unpleasant experience or meal here."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee, food, service, and space -- I've been going here for years and years, and the coffee quality has never changed. It's still $2 for a medium coffee iced or hot, tax included, same as it was years and years ago. I've yet to find any iced coffee on the planet that's better than the Firefly's."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Just moved to Oregon from Madison and this place is equal to the best coffee shops in Madison. I've only had their cold brew and one of their iced teas, super delicious. I've also gotten their avocado toast every time I've gone and it's so yummy. They have a cooler of delicious local cheese for sale and a few other local goodies. It's really cozy and very roomy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Firefly, which has an extensive menus and pastry selection, could be one of the biggest coffee shops I've ever seen. I arrived on a sunny but bitterly cold Monday morning and was happy for this café's warmth, complete with a fireplace in the middle of the room surrounded by arm chairs. I ordered one of the house coffees and the $6 Breakfast BELT Sandwich on a sun-dried tomato bagel (you can choose from several types of bagels or an English muffin). The bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato, and cheddar on the sandwich were good, and the bagel worked well with them. The coffee was good and strong, though nothing far exceeding my expectations.   Firefly has a nice, cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and seemed to draw a coffee-shop loving crowd from several surrounding towns judging by how bustling it was. The website aptly refers to it as \"Oregon's living room.\" If ever in the Oregon-area - or if you're looking to take a day trip from Madison or Milwaukee  - I'd recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"I hear the pastries are amazing but most were sold out today. However, they claim to have the world's best granola bars, and I have to agree with them. WOW! Good idea to split it with someone because they weigh about 6 pounds.  Also, they have Kickapoo coffee, which is one of my favorites. Many coffee drink choices in the menu and cool kids working at the counter.  Space is large and there are a number of sofas."}
{"text":"Good food & beverages but it's a little pricey. Their Mexican Spiced Hot Coco is phenomenal."}
{"text":"The Flying Pig on sundried tomato bagel has been my go-to almost every weekend! Their coffee and tea selection is amazing, and I love the eclectic atmosphere, this would be a great place to visit solo, as a couple, or part of a group. Our new favorite weekend spot!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this has moved up to the current top of my list for cafes, especially in my neighborhood options.  In general, here is WHY I love it :  * Free WORKING Internet(some don't, Starbucks charges and others are slow as crap.)  * LOTS of space. I HATE the places that cram you in like Sardines(see State Street places)  * Wine! (not all of them have 21+ beverages)  * Tons of options on the menu for both coffee and food.  * Friendly, polite and fast service.  Minor Cons -  Bathroom is pretty ghetto looking. It just needs more lighting and a working sensor on the paper towels.  Music was not of my taste, I'll bring headphones next time :)  Still gets 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop! Its got amazing organic fare trade coffee and they never let the coffee pumps run low. Super friendly staff and quick service. I have not yet had any of the breakfast/lunch foods or soups but I can tell by the aroma alone it must be good! I go 2-3x a week every week to check emails and do work stuff and you quickly feel like you belong here."}
{"text":"If I lived in the area, this would be a daily stop. Our group ordered beverages, coffee, sandwiches and dessert. Everything was fantastic. Plus, plus, extremely friendly staff. I am looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Firefly's atmosphere is to die for.  If you have little ones, this is the place for you.  They have a whole secluded carpeted area with lots of toys and friendly staff.  If you don't have kids, sit on the couch by the big window in front, or by the fireplace.  The coffee and pastries are fantastic, but the food is not so good.  They don't use real fruit for the smoothies and I can make a more creative sandwhich in my own kitchen.  If you're looking for excellent food, drive to Madison and go to Crema Cafe or Lazy Jane's.  It's a shame really, because they have the space and could easily make quality food.  For Oregon this is a real treasure though.  Oh, and try their homemade granola bars!  Yum!"}
{"text":"The Firefly has friendly, knowledgeable and fast service from a great team of baristas.  They have a great selection of baked goods all day, bagels and other selections for breakfast, and fresh sandwiches and soups for lunch.   It's a great coffeehouse with lots of space and lots of nooks and crannies to make everyone comfortable.  Lots of comfy chairs and couches and lots of tables to spread out and use their free Internet.  I enjoy the variety of music that they play and it's usually different depending on the time of day and who's working.  I actually hear a lot of new artists while I'm there.  If you haven't been out to Oregon to check out the Fly, then you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Great energy and vibe here. Food is okay, they're currently working on updating the menu. Wish they would invest in some better pickles like Clausen's or better yet make their own. On Thursdays they sell fresh local cheese curds. Love seeing the new owner working and interacting with customers."}
{"text":"Coffee is lukewarm and nothing to write home about. Nevertheless, this coffee shop is a saving grace in small town Wisconsin. The baked goods are delicious, though."}
{"text":"Exploring Oregon and love this discovery. Great coffee (Kickapoo) and very good hot food menu. Great staff. Lots of tables but the space still feels cozy. Kids have their own area and it doesn't interfere with grown ups wanting quiet time. Popular place. Cold brewed coffee too. Hope to be a regular!"}
{"text":"This is how a coffee shop should be. Delicious drinks in the cutest mugs known to mankind. Assorted pastries, yum. Wifi, yes, that's good. Books everywhere, and best of all: lots of seating. This is the sort of place you can sit and get comfortable in. Love love love Firefly."}
{"text":"Firefly is another of the coffee shops on the local weekend cycling circuit.  It's easy to find a really nice route with Firefly as a midpoint, and you'll be glad you did!  There's plenty of space here for groups, and, while they've always been doing a good business when I've been in, we've always managed to find space among the nice mix of tables & chairs, and couches with coffee tables.  There are also a few tables outside on nice days.    They aren't just bragging when they call their granola bar the world's best - many friends and I agree that it does indeed hold that title!"}
{"text":"This place is doing a lot of things right.  They expanded the place since the last time I was there and it is now more than double the size with a lot of nice little nooks to hide out in and act intelligent.   We ordered two coffees that were both made very well.  Good flavors and perfectly brewed. They bring in local talent for live music and theater. I expect to find places like this in large cities but not in a little place like Oregon, WI.  Who woulda thunk?  Please support this place so it does well and remains here.  We need places like this.  They make life so much better.  Thank you.  Update:  Just went back recently with relatives with young child.  They have a toy/game area that was perfect for kids to play in plus board games and tables to play at.   Great idea.   We really had a great time.  And the coffee was so very well made.on Tuesday afternoon on Sept 8th."}
{"text":"Consistently excellent coffee, pastries, and service.  This is a great spot in Oregon to relax and have a coffee.  There's plenty of comfortable places to sit with plenty of spots to plug in your devices (and free WiFi).  They offer quite a few board games to play and there's a child's section in the back with toys to keep your little ones occupied."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  It's so big and has so many cozy places to drink coffee and chat or work or crochet!  ;)   And awesome granola bars!"}
{"text":"Local favorite hands down. Granola bars are phenomenal, and the coffee is always hot! Always try to make a stop when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Great hometown coffee clutch spot! Loved the experience - will be back to check out some of the awesome menu options!"}
{"text":"I have to admit-for only being 10 minutes from home, I never think about coming to Oregon.  And after coming here for a few times, I am kicking myself from not coming sooner.  Trying to kill time during my daughter's swim practice, I landed at Firefly and I am glad I did.  The place is humongous yet it does a good job with seating, etc to make it comfortable and cozy..  Kudos for them carrying Kickapoo Coffee and well as Anoydne-two of my absolute favorites.  With 4-5 options, there is something for everyone.  Firefly also does breakfast and sandwiches. they bake everything in house which is always something I look for. If you are looking for a little something-something, go for their housemade granola bar.  A bunch of seeds, a bunch of nuts, blueberries, strawberries, some peanut butter and maple...sure it sounds like something you would put out for the birds but it is pure delicious. A big coffeehouse doing it right in a small town, you gotta love it."}
{"text":"Love this coffee shop. Be sure to get there early to get the amazing sweets and treats, including my absolute favorite - the granola bar."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a cup of coffee on my trip back and was glad I did. the coffee was good and the place was comfortable and clean. the staff was friendly. Will stop again."}
{"text":"This joint is a great edition to the downtown Oregon area. Many smaller towns, villages, etc suffer to maintain a vibrant downtown scene - this coffeehouse helps make downtown Oregon interesting and welcoming. The space is large decided into several rooms in a rehabbed older building. I like that the kids room is more or less separate from the other two rooms.  On my last visit to Oregon - now more or less a Madsion suburb (yes, I know locals probably don't appreciate this comment) I was at this local coffeehouse twice.   The coffee is decent. My 4 shot latte was good. But please do note they have sandwiches, soups, smoothies and pastries. But, order your coffee and make sure to pick up a couple of the house made Granola bars. Yes, Granola bars - this is a do not miss item. So drive in to thread of Oregon and check out this joint."}
{"text":"Cozy place for brunch, loved my breakfast veggie sandwich. They had a big enough place to spread out with comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Lots of space to lounge, study, play board games. Love the Mexican mocha!  Great little spot in the metropolis that is Oregon."}
{"text":"After moving to the area I was hoping I would fall in love with this place.  I have been there more than 10 times and each time, the espresso just hasn't tasted great, the food is fine, and it's nice that they have a small play area for kids.  The staff is not overly friendly or overly concerned about getting your order right."}
{"text":"Delicious Latte. I wish that I lived near this place. I would go here all the time. Large space, free wifi, table space to work and quiet for the most part. I also had a bagel which was very good. It seemed to be homemade but I'm not sure of that.   I'd definately go again."}
{"text":"Last weekend I was able to give Firefly Coffeehouse a try. I really enjoyed it. This is a big coffee shop with lots of room to spread out. There are little nooks to hide in and big tables to share with friends. I had a granola bar that was really good! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"An open letter to the maker of firefly's granola bars: you often provided my only nourishment on days I was traveling between Oregon and the twin cites to care for my terminally ill father the first half of 2014.  Thank you, my friend."}
{"text":"I stopped in after a hair cut.  It's been a while since I've been here.  A bunch of kids stopped in after school, all seem to know the owner, hanging out and being kids.  This is really a neat local coffee shop.  Great ambiance.  And...the lattes are EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"I went to Firefly to get some work done and grab some coffee recently. The staff was welcoming and the space had many options for comfortable seating and plenty of tables to work at. I was able to get a lot done and will be back to use it as an alternative office space again!"}
{"text":"First know that most of the time I only have coffee which is very good. If possible I like to sit on one of the 3 sides of the fireplace.  This morning my girl friend & I drove over from New Glarus to have lunch too. We both ordered the Hot Veggie  1/2 sandwich & soup combo. I had planned to get a salad until I saw one of the soups was kale + sweet potatoes which sounded interesting. The sandwich was on a rosemary sourdough bread. The soup had some other veggies in. Both were delicious.       We sat in a pair of easy chairs. There are so many places to sit here: if you want to work, the regular tables & chairs are abundant. Since I come to relax, I opt for an easy chair or couch. I also love the ambience of an old building and cheerful staff. You can tell it's a good place because teenagers come, meet their friends and appear to enjoy being here. Oh, did I mention they have a play area for little ones? Or a conference room that can be reserved? If I lived closer, I would be here much more often."}
{"text":"Great homemade soup and yummy sandwiches."}
{"text":"Stopped here multiple times.  Love that they sell organic Kickapoo Coffee. Also love that you can get decaf iced coffee.. so good!! Also really love all the various bakery items especially the house made granola bars. Tons of seats inside, and when the weather is nice there are usually 3 small tables outside. Always enjoy the service, coffee and food. Must stop here if near Oregon!!"}
