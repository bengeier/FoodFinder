{"text":"An excellent restaurant. The menu is very well chosen... A good place to go to taste and appreciate French cuisine. The plates are also designed to incorporate a Canadian/Québécois touch to them making them unique. The staff is excellent and the place is intimate and beautiful. It's definitely a fantastic place to invite someone for dinner."}
{"text":"Très bon service et y mange bien. Le prix du vin est très raisonnable. 
Le restaurant est très agréable et original esthétiquement parlant. 
A recommander."}
{"text":"Alors .... On attend toujours !! 45 minutes pour un pancake !! Et trois oeufs !! Domage pour une rue dans laquelle on pourrait facilement se faire un nom !! On pourrait penser que ce serait une opportunité pour eux mais visiblement - ils n'y ont pas encore pensé - on ne reviendra pas malgrès une super déco à l'interieur. On recommande fortement de faire une réservation à l'AVENUE qui ne se trouve qu'à seulement 200 mètres !!"}
{"text":"Excellent pour y bruncher! Bon service, belle déco, très belle découverte. J'y retournerais pour dîner! Je vous le conseil fortement."}
{"text":"Je suis allée y dîner avec ma mère il y a quelques semaines. Je vais vous parler de mon impression des dîners, mais prenez le temps de regarder leur menu de souper parce qu'il a l'air bien différent et un peu plus attrayant.


Pourquoi on y va? 

- Le décor rustique et artistique à la fois: des tables de grosses planches de bois, des linges à vaisselle comme serviettes de table, des murs de briques et des plafonds noirs entièrement crayonnés à la craie. Magnifique.

- Le personnel super sympathique, accueillant et souriant.


Petits hics?

- Je sais bien que la mode est au confort food et j'adore ce type de cuisine. Je l'adore lorsqu'il est bon, réconfortant et un peu revisité... Une touche du chef, c'est toujours plaisant. Ici, ça manque. On mange en se disant hmmm c'est bon! mais je pourrais me faire la même chose à la maison... 


Pour l'heure du lunch, les prix sont très abordables autant pour les plats que les breuvages (les verres de vins commencent à 6.50$!). Pour ceux qui veulent seulement grignoter entre amis, des noix, des olives et des frites sont également disponibles. Les frites sont bonnes!"}
{"text":"Good food, interesting logo. Good vibe and very good service. The food is flavorful and fresh, and the staff is always there if you need help, though when they're busy you might have to wave your hands to get their attention. Also a nice outside terrace for food when it's warm."}
{"text":"Personnel sympathique, bon service prix abordable.

Délicieux, mon tartare était divin"}
{"text":"We were looking for a little place to have brunch today (Saturday) and thankfully this was one of the few places that didn't have a line. We sat outside on the patio, which was lovely, but the service was not very good at all. We weren't given water until about 15 minutes after sitting down and we weren't offered english menus until about 30 minutes after sitting down. The water had quite a lot of floating lint in it, both times we were given refills which was disappointing. We got our food about 20 mins after ordering. I ordered pancakes with blueberries and caramelized bananas which was not bad. The texture and taste of the pancake was definitely unique.  My friend ordered eggs Benedict which was also pretty good, but the potatoes left something to be desired. Overall: alright"}
{"text":"Walked by this restaurant and noticed the awesome logo of a well illustrated frog (looks kinda like a salamander also). I peeped inside and saw how cozy it looked. Decided to eat there with my boyfriend and wow was is it a great choice. Our waiter was attentive and everyone was friendly. I ordered the cream of mushroom and a bavette plus home fries. My boyfriend had the lasagna. I must say the cream of mushroom...was seriously legit. Why I say this? Most of cream of mushroom I eat, is just full of cream and barely mushrooms! This one on the other hand was super rich! I really enjoyed it.

My bavette was slightly overcooked and not bloody enough for me, but that's ok. Usually restos don't make it rare enough to my liking. It was acceptable and the fries were really tasty. I dipped mine in the mayo that was given and I think by the end of the meal almost all the mayo was gone. Oops.  I also had a tasty rose on the more really fruity side for 7 bucks.

Oh and I have to add, for game lovers ...there's a sega system towards the back with Safari Hunt, equipped with gun. Um...how awesome?? I shot ducks and bunnies, bears for the rest of the night before paying my bill. 

Prices are reasonable for a French restaurant by the way.. Check it out if you're in the plateau area. I really recommend it!"}
{"text":"Ambiance agréable et personnel très sympathique. J'ai vraiment eu un coup de coeur pour la déco du resto et  j'ai bien aimé l'idée de laisser des craies à notre disposition dans les salles de bain, pour nous inciter à griffonner sur les murs! C'est une bonne idée, c'était amusant!
Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, mon burger végé et le sorbet trois couleurs étaient bons, mais sans plus. 
J'y retournerai...surement..."}
{"text":"Good little restaurant! Had the steak and fries. The steak was perfectly cooked; fries were way over salted and inedible. I mostly gave this restaurant 4 stars because of their wine list. They have a very impressive list with the most expensive bottle of wine being in the $65 range. I would definitely try this place again...but would skip the fries."}
{"text":"Great brunch! There was a bit of a wait on a Saturday afternoon but it wasn't too bad. It was verrryyyy slow though after ordering, so be prepared to wait for your food. The quality of the food was amazing. Love their ice coffee (they add milk and sugar mmm), and the eggs benedict with mushrooms and spinach was fantastic. Great vibes all around."}
{"text":"We found this little gem strolling through Montreal on a weekend jaunt. The decor and ambience are charming and unique and the waitstaff is attentive and friendly without hovering. We had the foie gras, Quebec cheese platter and the duck confit. All were spectacular and very authentic tasting with unique additions. Very glad we stumbled upon it!"}
{"text":"First time in Montreal, trying to find something on Mount Royal before hitting St Laurent on Friday night and walked past this place.  I didn't have booking so was led to sit at the bar which was perfectly fine for me.

Bartender explained all the specials to me patiently and I tried 2 appetizers instead of ordering a main.  The portion size seems more bistro/ American than French so that worked out perfectly.  

Service speed was very reasonable, the restaurant was completely full with what I can gather a big party of almost 20 people over 3 tables near the back and another 2 party of 8 in the front.

Split pea soup was very flavorful with the addition of the pulled pork, fried smelts with garlic mayo I loved and would actually make a great bar snack with wine.  The other thing I ordered was a pudding with blue berries and pot of creme.  That was ok probably not something I would go back to this place for.

If I have time before I leave might come back and try something else.

Want to give it 3.5 stars actually because I am a dessert person and it didn't wow me there.  Prices were very reasonable given the quality of food tho and quite a good selection of wine as well so I will let the 4 star sits..."}
