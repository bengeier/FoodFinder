{"text":"This is a fantastic little eatery having great food and a welcoming and cozy atmosphere.  Our group of 4 were welcomed and served by Jenny the owner.  We ordered the  1/2 rack of ribs, jerk chicken and the BBQ parfait with brisket.  Feedback on the ribs was chicken was very good and I especially like the BBQ parfait.  Served in a bowl, the BBQ parfait had some of everything with the perfect amount of spiciness to compliment the flavors.  Two squeeze bottles of different BBQ sauces are on the table in case you prefer to \"sauce-up\" your meal.  Save room for dessert as we highly recommend the peach cobbler in a jar.  Take-out seems to a popular option too as noted by the number people popping in and out.  This place will definitely be on our list of favorites places for dinner.  Kudos to Jenny for a delicious and fun night out."}
{"text":"If you want good BBQ in Calgary, this is the spot. The pulled pork poutine and steak bites are the best I've had. First time having catfish and I'll definitely be ordering again. Small place, pretty much take out and delivery only but what a find. Try it yourself, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My partner and I came in with a $20 Groupon. We've been hoping to find a good BBQ place in Calgary, as my partner is from the southern US and often craves it - wow, did we find one! My partner ordered the BBQ parfait with pork and I ordered the pulled pork with a coconut cornbread muffin and fries. Everything was AMAZING - better than most places in the South! We were pretty surprised, as we've only had seriously subpar American-style BBQ in Calgary (prior to this, of course). The staff was super friendly and the portions were massive. Incredible deals for the price, which was cheap to begin with. We loved everything we tried and we will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious - but service is very, very slow.  The mac n cheese is one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff were great, and the food is AMAZING! I hope everyone gets a chance to experience this place! Make sure you try the alligator bites!"}
{"text":"OMG this had the best brisket I've ever eaten. Mac & cheese to die for. Good portion size. Will be back."}
{"text":"I just had the best burger of my life at Jane Bond tonight.  Everyone, you have to try the Bond Burger."}
{"text":"Came here after searching my hood for some decent bbq.  Had the combo 2 with a leg of jerk chicken, brisket and pulled pork.  Asked for the chicken to be really spicy and the chef presented us with a side of diced  scotch Bonnetts.  It definitely heated things up!  The chicken was nice and blackened, the pulled pork was good...I'm not a huge fan of pulled pork, but this was good, I liked it not being drowned in some sort of too tangy a bbq sauce.   The star of the meats was the brisket.  Moist, enough fat to make it delish.  I would have preferred a little more smoke flavour in the meats, but all in all everything was bad ass.   Had corn bread and beans as sides.  The corn bread was on pace to be the best I've ever had...moist, dense.  The beans were prepared in the chefs style, with corn and other flavours resembling a chili of sorts.  My only regret was not having fries to pour those bad ass beans over!  After the meal I was catching up with friends who I hadn't seen for a while.  The chef approached us asking if we wanted dessert.  My mouth said yes but my stomach said no!  She offered to make a couple of dessert cups just to satisfy our sweet tooth.   She made a peach cobbler and chocolate something or other.  Both were mind blowing!   To top it off she gave us the desserts as complements of the house.  Great warm  staff, and good attitudes goes a long way in my books.  I'd definitely recommend this place for bbq!!  Go there! Support local businesses! !!"}
{"text":"We ordered dinner for a work related event at our home And were so disappointed by the service and the quality of food.  The food arrived 2 hours late and we were sitting around panicking that it would not come at all, while trying to appear calm in front of our 16 guests, including 5 hungry children.  There was no response to our phone calls or emails until the food was already and hour late.  Now for the quality. The food arrived and was thankfully quite hot still. However, the mac and cheese and the potatoes were basically inedible.  They were so strongly smoke flavoured.  The meat was just ok.  The owner apologized by email and offered a free dinner at her restaurant.  No thanks"}
{"text":"Alright, this location is not in the best part of town so don't say I didn't warn you! But it's worth the visit!   BBQ is all about sharing so the times I've been here, I've brought friends. The first time, we got the combo platter of jerk chicken, pulled pork, smoked brisket with the mac & cheese and coconut corn bread as our sides. The second time, we got a full rack of the St Louis ribs and the onion ring poutine.  Although I'm not a huge pulled pork or brisket fan, Jane Bond really knocked it out of the park! The ribs were saucy and fall off the bone good! The poutine - meh. It was ridiculously salty and i think the combo of BBQ sauce AND gravy was too much, maybe one or the other would have been better.  They have daily specials here like HH from 3-6pm that includes $4 highballs, $5 wine, half price appies and $20 off their Bond Platter (trust me, we've already planted the idea with our friends to take advantage of this!) so you have no reason to not check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came back to Jane Bond for a second visit.  Happy to report that they have hit their stride.  Really good food here, and a really fun visit.  The peach cobbler is still fantastic.  Try to save room for it."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Best BBQ place in town.  Great food.  Consistent quality.  Good size servings.  Always fresh.  Great atmosphere. My favorite bbq places."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The ribs, brisket, pulled pork, everything is terrific. Best BBQ in Calgary, nope, Alberta."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab some food for a late lunch as I had a Groupon about to expire. What a mistake - there was no way we could possibly eat all the things we wanted to try!  Settled for the brisket and pulled pork, with sides of baked beans, coconut cornbread, mashed potato, and garlic butter peas and carrots. Everything was amazing. The coconut cornbread was unreal!  I am so excited that we can come here all year long now and dont just need to wait for food truck season."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for $12. When I look at my receipt when I got home I received a $10 discount for a net loss of $2.  Regardless, the food was tasty, the service was friendly. I will likely return."}
{"text":"Our dinner started out with really great service from two servers. Very accommodating with substitutions on the menu, and just really nice in general. We ordered one combo with brisket and chicken and our side were mac'n'cheese, caesar salad, and corn bread. From time of ordering it took 30 minutes for our food to arrive. The restaurant was very quiet, and for a BBQ place I expect most food to be already cooked when it's ordered.  The brisket was good, just a little burnt tasting on the outside. The mac'n'cheese was delicious with a smokey flavour. The chicken was not cooked through, and how this was handled by management is why the review is so low. Our server took one look at the chicken and immediately apologized. I had just said to take it off the bill but she said it wouldn't take more than 10 mins. We waited the 10 mins and then just asked again for it to be removed from the bill. This is when a manager (owner, possibly), came over with what started to be an apology but turned into \"But that chicken was definitely cooked\". No, it wasn't. Pink juices running out the middle of it is not cooked through, but I wasn't going to argue. She proceeded to tell me they cook it for an hour at 325.   Generally, I'm very understanding when shit happens. I honestly would not of let that undercooked chicken affect my review, but when the manager/owner comes out and makes a point of tell me it was fully cooked... well the picture is attached for you to be the judge. I get that smoked chicken can have a pink tinge to it, but it should not be bloody when you cut into the middle.   Unfortunate experience, that was handled so well by the servers, but ruined by the management. I truly cannot recommend a restaurant where the management says this chicken is cooked through. See the photo yourself, and you be the judge."}
{"text":"The Jane Bond BBQ food truck attended an event in the community of Walden this weekend. It was a showhome event as it is a new community. You would have to go through a showhome and every showhome you went through you got 1 ticket and it costed 3 ticket for a meal from this food truck.  The options you got were BBQ pulled pork or jerk chicken and the side options were mac and cheese or coconut cornbread.  I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and then they asked me if I wanted the jerk chicken sauce on it which I thought was a little weird. So I said no and asked if I could have BBQ sauce which was fine.  My Mom got the Jerk Chicken but the chicken was so dry in the bun and did not have enough sauce on it so the BBQ pork was much better.  For the sides being either coconut cornbread or Mac and cheese both were amazing.  The mac and cheese had a smoky taste which made it even better !"}
{"text":"Had a lunch catered recently. It was pretty good. I would think the food right from their location would be a bit more interesting.  Going to try it out soon. They are pretty close, and I do love BBQ."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. We were a party of three and everyone enjoyed their meals. Got to try the ceasers it's like a meal in itself! We ordered brisket burger, brisket and chicken and waffle. Well be back to try the tacos and the mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Ordered two brisket dinners and chose coleslaw and Cajun corn cob for sides which were both simply amazing!  The Cajun corn is simply an original and amazingly delicious turn on an old favourite. I must have this every time! The coleslaw is well seasoned and not too creamy which is right up my alley so I'm a huge fan.   The brisket itself was AMAZING! Beautifully smoked, lovingly sliced, tender and tons of flavour with a fantastic house made BBQ sauce for dipping.   Also, a side of deep fried pickles, easily the best I've ever had. Crispy seasoned costing and I chose the horseradish mayo for the perfect compliment.   It's been a while since I've been impressed with a restaurant, and this one just blew my mind. Every single mouthful is a delight and I can't wAit to go back and try the rest of the menu.   Kudos!!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty, St. Louis ribs were a bit fatty. Had better in Kansas. Go check it out."}
{"text":"Five stars for atmosphere four for the food. I had the BBQ parfait and I would come back again and again for this entree. Mashed potatoes corn gravy beans and brisket, my dream meal. My husbands entree was underwhelming and VERY heavy on artificial smoke flavor. My son had pork poutine which was an appetizer but a HUGE portion. Two desserts were enjoyed, peach cobbler...... amazing and a chocolate cake thing also delicious. As for critiques..... the same song played over and over and the artificial smoke flavor is waaaaaaaaaay too strong. Great place please check it out"}
{"text":"Definitely 5 stars. Always great!! Authentic bbq. I need to go back and get me some chicken and brisket asap mmm"}
{"text":"Was SO curious to try this at the food truck \"taste the trucks\" event in east village. I LOVE BBQ and this place caught my eye immediately! However, when I walked up, nobody was there. Nobody was inside the truck either. There was also no signage as to where they might be. I waited for twenty minutes while my friend got us some perogies from the next truck over as we were starving.  I then decided to go and eat at the truck on the other side, hoping they'd show up while I waited in line. As I was waiting this whole time, several people went up and looked longingly into the truck. I mentioned to them that nobody was there and they hadn't been for quite some time. Lots and lots of disappointed looks and comments.  One guy even joked about jumping over and serving me up the pulled pork that I was craving.  Sadly, I ended up settling for a salad next door that had pulled pork on it.  After eating and still watching for somebody to show in case I could maybe try dessert there - I realized nobody was coming and moved on.  All in all, I noticed that nobody was there for about 50 mins. Then we left, so I'm not sure if somebody eventually showed. Would've been nice to see a sign as to possible wait  time for their return- or at least close your truck window so we don't all have our hopes up."}
{"text":"A really solid BBQ experience. Everything tasted really great, awesome variety of flavours and great smokiness to the BBQ. Very accommodating to our large group!"}
{"text":"Calgary has always been lacking in quality BBQ options, but this place is super solid! Jerk chicken is excellent but could, and should, be spicier. Great pulled pork that isn't mushy, and incredible mac n cheese. On the expensive side but its so good that it's worth it."}
{"text":"I live close by Jane Bond, i moved into Forest Lawn from down town and was worried about not having interesting places walking distance from home, then I learnt about Jane Bond! Thank you Jane Bond, you are a huge asset to the community! This is a great environment, great foot, great service!"}
{"text":"It was such a treat to go to Jane Bond. My husband had come across it and so we decided to check it out for our date night yesterday. It is a place tucked around the corner (ish) from 17th Ave SE, and it is very unassuming upon first glance.  Once we walked in through the door, the ambiance was warm and welcoming as though you were popping in for some good home cooked meals.    I got the jerk chicken leg with coconut cornbread and cajun corn. We also ordered onion rings to start, but the server/co-owner forgot to put it in right away - she apologized profusely and put it on rush after we brought it to her attention.  I appreciated them being very careful about the whole nut-allergy situation (yay! no issues!), and the food was delicious. The Jerk sauce is of mild to medium spice, and very flavourful, though could use a bit more spice for my tastes.  The cornbread!! OH the cornbread was so good :) totally hit the spot. I tried a bit of my husband's mac and cheese side and seriously!! So good.  The service - awesome! After the server/co-owner realized she missed the onion rings, she took it off our bill and gave it to us as an apology! Very knowledgeable, very friendly, and on the ball!   I highly recommend this place - it is worth the trip! We are happy we've found a new BBQ place and so excited to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I have picked up lunch here a couple of times. The meat parfait was really good but the Mac and cheese will knock your socks off"}
{"text":"BBQ arrives in #YYC! If you haven't heard of or been to Jane Bond, figure yourself out and make it a priority.   Jenny and co made my step-daughters birthday an awesome experience with personal, prompt and killer service .. fantastic food and a wicked ambience.   The old fashioned, BBQ chicken, Mac and cheese, the hoagie and catfish were all fantastic options. Liberal portions at an agreeable price point make it that much sweeter. Speaking of sweeter, the desserts are incredible and the signature drinks are insane ..!   This will become a regular spot for us - gotta try everything on the menu .. at least once! Yes"}
{"text":"There are those moments when you visit a restaurant, have an amazing experience and realize you HAVE to eventually leave.  Too bad we couldn't take Jane Bond BBQ home with us because I'd have the mac & cheese every day of the week.  Don't get me wrong, Jane Bond is, in my opinion, Calgary's preeminent place for BBQ, but I just couldn't stop thinking about the mac & cheese.  The texture of the crumbled cornbread mixed in with a hint of BBQ sauce.  It's ingenious how the bit of acidity in the BBQ sauce combines with the cheese so well.  I had the hoagie, but with brisket.  The hoagie is a huge sub sandwich with layers of cheese, pickles and onion rings.  You can tell it was well made and thought out down to the choice of bread.  The bun was the perfect thickness, soft on the inside and held the \"goods\" together.  There was a tad bit of a wait for our food to come out but I think it was because our appetizer got missed.  It was quickly corrected by the lovely owner and the onion ring appetizer came out a minute after our meals.  Great onion rings and the chipotle mayo sauce had a good amount of heat.  The owner was nice enough to take the onion rings off our bill, even though I think it was mostly my fault for adding too many side orders to my hoagie, it probably confused the order :)  I grew up in Forest Lawn / Heights area and the unassuming location in Forest Lawn is perfect because it becomes a destination spot for me to visit the old hood (I'm allowed to say 'hood' because I grew up there ok? :)  The Tennessee sweat tea was a great refreshing drink to wash all that goodness down.  The bill, even after a tip was quite good considering all the food we ate, we almost had to be rolled out of there.  I'd highly recommend checking out Jane Bond for your next BBQ experience."}
{"text":"Wow!  Very delicious. A group of six of us got the Bond Platter. With hungrier folks, you may need to order more. Everything was well cooked and tasted excellent. Brisket and pulled pork were the most popular from the platter. Chorizo was quite delicious as well. The platter is a great way to sample all the different kinds of meat. We will be back for more!  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Got invited to jane bond for taco Tuesday \"dogmom\" night out...  We had brisket taco $2 Gotta order by 2.  Tried the chorizo it's great as well.  My friend ordered the ribs with fries and corn on the cob it's really good she said.  The gravy is smoked too. So it's kinda weird taste like eating smoke.  I ordered 6 tacos...it comes with beans and corn so if you don't like the beans..   The ambiance is great...the music is on blues...and awesome company....and of course...yummy fud.  Oh by the way if you like to try...they also serve....Gator meat....if you're up for it.  A must check out place to enjoy...good food and music."}
