{"text":"A friend of mine took me here for a drink one night...   What a wonderful concept, a boat bar on the canal, the atmosphere is very mellow and relaxed. The drinks are cheap, the owner is too nice and serves you with a smile.   This is the perfect place for a drink after dinner, it looks like a refurbished bateau-mouche that they use in the old port. The top of the boat is windowed so a lot of light comes in.  My reviews are usually only about food and not service. But for this review, it's just about the ambiance and the service, since I only had a beer and no food.  I'm waiting to take all my friends here, ONE BY ONE hihi so I can come again many times.  The owner told me they open until 11pm every night, if only they opened a little later fridays and saturdays...  Anyhow it's a charming little bar, worth a try, you'll like it"}
{"text":"Super endroit avec une vue magnifique sur le canal. Les hôtes du bateau sont extraordinaires et l'ambiance est juste assez festive sans être trop bruyante. Belle découverte !"}
{"text":"You will find the floating canal lounge boat behind Atwater market . We went early on a sunny June night and were able to find street parking close by. The location is great . It is a perfect place for drinks . Food menu is very limited . Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite place to grab a drink at in Montreal!   The floating lounge is situated on a boat that is docked right behind the Atwater Market and is literally the cutest place I've been to in a LONG time. A friend and I stopped by on a Wednesday evening around 8pm and waited for about 10 minutes before a table became available. Once seated, we quickly ordered cocktails and a sharing platter of some dips, charcuterie, and cheese (basically the only filling food on the menu). Everything came out quickly, was super delicious, and the entire experience was very pleasant. After about an hour and a half, our hostess invited us to sit outside at the front of the boat where the 2 seats had just become free - we were over the moon and quickly accepted her offer (FYI, all seating is indoors except for two seats at the front of the boat, and about 4 seats at the back). It was such a great experience and felt completely private.  We were so impressed with the service, quality, and price, and can't wait to be back! The boat leaves the canal in October or November so make sure you check them out before then!"}
{"text":"Beautiful and charming! The menu is incredibly simple listing nothing but the basics in drinks (white and red wine, a small selection of beer and your classic spirits). There are only drinks on the menu with chips, popcorn and olive to munch on as you enjoy the colourful, calming ambience and view of the lachine canal. The owner is incredibly friendly and it's not too crowded making it the perfect place to lounge before or after dinner. The menu is very reasonably priced so don't be afraid to indulge. The boat lounge is fantastically decorated. We'll definitely be back! Be sure to check out the album of the boat lounge project to see how it came about!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this hidden gem. Montreal needs more of these boat lounges. Drinks were well priced and well done. Not much food, but there was a great platter for 2 of hummus, guacamole and tzatziki with assorted breads and cheese."}
{"text":"Si vous aimeriez prendre un verre proche de l'eau. Je vous recommande le canal lounge. Ce petit bateau au marché Atwater vous offres une très bonne variété de boissons et de petits entrées."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!!!! So did both my friends!!   So happy I went! So sad it's closing soon for the season and will hafta wait 'til spring before they come back! (I believe we overheard the 10th of October (2016) as the last day). We weren't smart enough to ask when they're opening back up in 2017.   Follow Atwater down past the Atwater Market and just to the right of the sign for the Lachine Canal at the end of the street is the dock leading down to Canal Lounge.   Prices are fabulous!! Drinks are fabulous!! Ambiance is fabulous (nice soft jazz music playing and -- despite thinking it would be -- not at all hipster...actually surprised at the much older crowd for a Wednesday evening).   DO NOT EXPECT TO EAT!! And therefore please do not give this place a bad rating thinking it's a restaurant...it's not. It's a cocktail lounge. Period. It has a few snacky items but that's it.  DO EXPECT to drink wonderfully mixed drinks. Unfortunately do also expect your red wine to be cold.  Service was very nice, don't expect speedy because they do take the time to talk to their patrons and it's a small place that fills up around 5pm and empties again around 7 (at least on Wednesday).   The bathroom was incredibly adorable I absolutely loved it!! The door slides open (don't try to push or pull). The flush is actually a button on the cabinet below the sink that you hafta hold to flush...took me a minute to figure it out (despite the sign next to it) which is why I mention it.   Got a chance to speak with one of the owners who was surprised to hear I learned about them on Yelp...he didn't even know what Yelp was lol!! He was happy to learn of their perfect rating here too (he told me they have a perfect rating on fb too). He also told me they want to expand with other boats all down the dock like a boardwalk type set up...so excited for that to happen!!   This place is a perfect gem of a Yelp-iscovery! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This floating cafe-bar is actually a renovated boat that docks in the Lachine Canal behind the Atwater market during the warmer months; as soon as Parks Canada opens the canal to boats and till the first sign of cold weather.    I've been here on a Saturday afternoon, as well as on a Friday night, and the place is always jammed. They take no reservations so you'll definitely need to be patient if you're waiting in line.  The venue has a laid back feel, and the wide windows allow you to look out into the canal; you'll notice the colourful banquets, white chairs, dark wooden tables, neon overhead lighting and the bar in the back of the boat which add to the chill vibe of this lounge. Two seating areas are also available on the back and front deck, if you're lucky to grab the spots first.   I had my usual dark and stormy during my evening visit; the drinks were great and reasonably priced at an average 10$ while the house cocktails are 8$. There is no kitchen but you can order some small plates like spreads and pickles with bread, although popcorn is always graciously offered.  I will definitely return to this spot albeit the wait, if not for their cocktails but for a laid back afternoon of people watching."}
{"text":"The best part is that you're on a boat! Love the decor and ambiance, but the drinks and snacks aren't exceptional. You're paying for the ambiance, just a head's up. Also, a bummer that it closes so early. My friends and I were ready for an evening of catching up, but it was cut 'short' at 11pm. Keep in mind."}
{"text":"Original spot, original drinks! A little too loud for a night out with the misses, would enjoy this atmosphere more in my 20s, but was a nice experience nevertheless!"}
{"text":"Charmant petit café/bar situé sur le canal Lachine. Il s'agit en fait d'un bateau mouche vieux de près de 45 ans qui a été racheté par les deux propriétaries actuels. C'est le tout premier café flottant à Montréal et l'idée est géniale!! Le jour, tout est en couleur, beaucoup de verdure, de fleurs qui colorent l'endroit, on peut s'asseoir sur le toit du bateau et profiter du soleil. Puis, en soirée les lumières se tamisent prenant des airs de lounge, la musique change également. on se gâte avec des bulles, la bouteille de prosecco est vraiment abordable (environ 30$). Demandez des snacks pour faire passer l'alcool :) on vous propose du pop corn, des olives et chips. Le service est amiable et super friendly. A essayer absolument avant que cela ne devienne trop achalandé. Tout près du marché Atwater et de la rue Notre Dame ou on peut finir la soirée dans un bon restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Cute little boat that's turned in to a bar. The drinks are a bit pricey but you're paying for the ambiance. Probably more for tourists but I still enjoyed chatting over a glass of rosé!"}
{"text":"I am looking forward to see the boat there again. Naturally, they don't open during the winter, but the owners just had an amazing idea to transform (literally) the boat into a cozy and beautiful lounge.   Wine and cocktails options are available, but don't expect to find anything to eat. You will have a light menu of appetizers just to have something on the table, but do not hesitate to eat something before at the Marché Atwater.   Kudos to the owners and their cute dog. They are all very sweet."}
{"text":"Ca fait different, original, why not, line up en soiree, juste que proche de la fenetre je trouve que ca pu les eaux staignantes du canal..."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Tucked away at the bottom of the Atwater market, literally in the canal, this refurbished dinner boat is the first floating café/bar to grace the Montréal scene. We had the pleasure of chatting with the owner of the establishment- after discovering the abandoned vessel he took two years to renovate and transform it into a chique yet incredibly inviting bar-on-the-water. On top of sharing his story, he was welcoming and clearly just so thrilled to have the chance to invite folks onto his boat.  The drinks are very affordable yet nothing particularly fancy. If you're like me, then you'll be adequately jazzed by the fact that you're literally drinking on the canal, in a beautiful bar nonetheless, and the basic nature of the drinks won't be a bother. A total experience that can't be passed up if you're in the area."}
