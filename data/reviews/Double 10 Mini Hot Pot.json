{"text":"Really excellent hot pot with a good selections of ingredients. There's a small bar where you can select your own sauces, noodles, and eggs."}
{"text":"Hits the spot every time. The \"make your own sauce\" bar is phenomenal. Spicy, hot/sour, and mushroom broths are all good. Servers are attentive even when it's busy. Lunch price is very reasonable. I have cravings for this place all the time."}
{"text":"This was our first experience at a hot pot restaurant. The waiter was extremely helpful and patient with us!  We  really ebuoyed the meal and can't wait to do it again.   I had the crab legs. I made a mess with them, bit they were delicious.   My daughter had the seafood  combo. It had octopus. Squid, fish, shrimp, etc. She said all the fish were good, my husband did the pork combo.  Everyone enjoyed their food. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came into this little restaurant for lunch and was not disappointed. Don't thrown off by the outside of this restaurant; although the outside gave me a skeptical first thought, inside was a hidden gem.   I ordered the mushroom broth during lunch hours which came with a plate of mixed vegetables and about 6-7 slices of beef for about $12. In the back of the restaurant theres a station with a variety of different sauces to pair with your meal, along with both unlimited egg and rice noodles. The mixed vegetable plate came with cabbage, corn, rice cakes, enoki mushrooms, lotus root, sausage, and a lot of other things. I loved the variety. The beef was thinly sliced and was not at all chewy.   In addition to the hot pot, I ordered the bubble milk tea (~$4). The tea itself was very good with an authentic tea flavor, and just the right amount of sweetness; though, I did feel like more bubbles could have been added and the bubbles were of the harder side.   All in all, I am so happy I tried this place because I always drove by it. An authentic experience with great food, at a decent price. Any one who hasn't tried hot pot should take a chance here!"}
{"text":"In from out of town and made a reservation about a week ago. They had no record of it and did not accommodate us. Will not be eating here!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and will definitely go back! The service is excellent, very fast and super friendly. The vegetables and meat are all fresh and the broths are homemade and delicious. A great place to have dinner."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday with the family. I called in advance to see if they offered the $10 combination hot pot special over the weekend and I was told they do but then told otherwise once we arrived. For $15 I think the combination hot pot was a bit pricey, especially since they don't offer free eggs before 5p on weekends but if it was $10 that would have been worth it. Regardless, the place was hopping with patrons and we had a short wait before being seated.   The combination hot pot came with a choice of soup base (spicy, kimchi, or mushroom), choice of meat (we all got beef), and an assortment of veggies and fish cakes. Everything was fresh looking and tasty with the condiment offerings. Everything came out quickly and waitstaff was plenty attentive. I had enough leftovers to take home for next day's lunch. I would come again, but during the weekday for lunch!"}
{"text":"How fun!  The service was excellent and personalized. My server helped me with my sauces, how long to cook my seafood, what combinations to mix together. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Good portion size. Can be a bit pricey (especially if you add side orders) but definitely worth it. The sauce bar is awesome. The service is good, first time visit was 10/10 and I cannot wait to go back! Had it 8 hours ago and can't stop thinking about it. Yum!"}
{"text":"We moved here last year from Los Angeles and overnight our diets changed. It's not that I don't love your fried cheese curds, Wisconsin, but I miss the comfort foods of home. While we found good tacos here within a week or so, finding real hot pot seemed unlikely. We saw the sign for this place go up a month or two before it opened, got excited but didn't want to give our hopes up. But it ended up being exactly what we'd hoped for. This place is a dream. Delicious, reasonably priced, exactly right. While I still miss the variety you get at Little Sheep-type hot pot in LA, I definitely don't miss spending 30 dollars a person. Mini Hot Pot gives you a big platter of veggies and tempura and rice cakes and endless noodles at their noodle bar. Go for the spicy broth, it's the tastiest. Their sweet potato noodles (vietnamese) are my favorite. And I love the new coconut broth because you can flavor it and spice it however you want from the spice bar. The service is super-friendly and everyone is so helpful and patient there with questions. Every time we go, it's like being a little closer to home. I hope they keep getting the recognition they deserve."}
{"text":"The owner helped us make an awesome sauce at the sauce bar.  The favorite broths for our family were the Szechwan for those who like it spicy and the Korean Kimchi for those who like it flavorful, without the heat.  For 2 adults and 2 teenagers, we ordered Two Dinner Combos and we each got our own broth.  We thought we would then add on with side orders if needed, but this filled us up plenty with the extra noodles available at the sauce bar.  We even had a couple containers to bring home.  Not bad to feed all 4 of us dinner for $40 plus lunch the next day.  The owners and their daughter were just great.  We were celebrating a birthday and they noticed and commented on it.  Looking forward to a return visit.  The only bummer is that the tables are barely large enough to hold a drink, the platter of food to cook and the cook top.  A bit of a juggling act, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Definitely as good as it gets ! Huge portions. Went in for lunch on the weekend and it was $13-$15/person which is an excellent deal considering how much food you get. We had enough leftovers for two more meals. Hosts were very friendly and were patient in explaining how hot pot works. They checked on everyone a few times and made sure everyone was enjoying their meal. It is also all you can eat ! Flavors were fantastic ! Must try and well worth the money."}
{"text":"The lady up front is so kind and polite. My family and I typically go here on the weekends and we just love it here. We typically share one large hot pot at home, but we love how this restaurant focuses on individual hot pots. We are always given fast service and end up spending almost 1-2 hours here. Wonderful service and very interactive experience with your food so make sure you have time! This place definitely isn't a \"quick bite\" kind of restaurant! But the service is great, broth is well flavored and it's definitely a great experience!"}
{"text":"It was a very cold night and a perfect time to enjoy a hot pot of broth and noodles. This is our first time. The meats and sauces and vegetables were delicious. It was a fun experience and the friendly service made it something we want to do again soon."}
{"text":"Very surprised about the good ratings. Tried it for lunch. The broth was bland and has a plain taste of salty water plus some chili peppers. I don't recommend this place and will not come back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great hotpot!  We decided to stop by based on the reviews and it sure did not let us down.  It's a clean cute little restaurant with great parking.  It was pretty busy as we arrived around 8pm on a Friday evening.    We ordered the Spicy kimchi broth with beef.  Wow!  The portion was huge!  They gave a lot of veggies (which we did not finish) and a perfect amount of beef.  The broth on the other hand was alright (a little too bland for a kimchi broth,  I was expecting a little bit more flavour)   Staff was amazing!  defiantly a must if you're in the area and is craving a something little nice and warm."}
{"text":"Pros: Affordable Unlimited sauce, eggs and noodles Fresh meat  Cons: The beef/lamb slices should be thinner. This is the reason that meat tastes so tough after boiling in the hot pot."}
{"text":"Great food! The owner is so sweet and always check up on our table. My daughter was throwing tantrums and he came over to talk to her in a very friendly manner. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Went here on a date night with my husband. Our first experience with hot pots, and the staff did a nice job explaining the options and offerings. The food was delicious and you get a lot for the price! Can't beat unlimited noodles either...we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! The owners were so helpful in taking our orders and kindly answered every question us newbies asked. I ordered the coconut broth (yum!) and my companions ordered the mushroom and kimchee broths. We were wowed at the 3 huge plates of broth additions (we could've easily shared one plate) Very fun to try the different noodles and sauces. The bubble tea was delightfully unusual but fun to sip on. So much food I had to ask for a take home container which fed me for 2 more meals.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like their noodle. Tried the spicy hot pot, about the average."}
{"text":"What a genius innovation to come to Madison!  Dined here with the family for pawpaw's birthday. You select your choice of meat and style of broth from the menu. Simple as that. Select any add-ons that you wish. Proceed to the sauce bar in the back of the room and make your concoction. My favorite part is the freshly, crushed garlic. My own recipe goes a little like this: 1 tbsp crushed garlic, 2 tbsps sesame oil, 1 tbsp Mongolian Sauce, and a dash of salt. Just like grandpop used to make!   There are a bucket of raw eggs to add to your already mounting plate of food and sensory. You can do one of two things, crack it open in your boiling pot, or put the egg with shell in the broth for a hard boiled egg.  Two noodles await your gleaming eyes; mung bean (glass) noodles and yellow lo mein noodles.  The gracious waitress will bring you a plate of veggies containing spam, wienies, fish balls, fried and fresh tofu.  We tried the Korean Kimchi and Sichuan Spicy Broth. There are white peppercorn and dried red chilis in the Sichuan broth, don't attempt unless you're ready to handle the heat. For the tamer palate, lots of plain broth had to be added to ease the burn. As I type this, Sucker for Pain is playing on Pandora, huh. I would say, the Sichuan broth is still not 'ma-la' as you would find in a real hot pot restaurant in Chengdu, but still - pretty authentic.   You can really tell the owners take pride in their product, even going around and checking on every table in the house and refilling the broths if they are running low.  Oh, and they have boba teas!!"}
{"text":"Best hot pot in town! I recommend the mushroom both hotpot with the seafood option. Large portions if you order the combo. Overall, excellent food and service for yourself or family."}
{"text":"This is not a typical hot pot place. Choice was very limited and the soup base's flavorless. The portion was too small for the price."}
{"text":"Newbie to Hot Pot (so much that I had to look it up on youtube!), but saw the fun reviews from fellow yelpers and thought \"I need to try this!\" I admit I was scared about the \"cooking my own RAW chicken meat\" (from one plate, touching everything under it, to the reusable soup, one set of chopsticks that touch raw, soup, and cooked) without any friend there to \"hold my hand\" - I mean I was FREAKED. But everything went well and I had alot of fun.  So for those of you new like me and without a guide: 1) You sit down and pick soup base + meat choice. ASK to sample the broth before choosing. 2) Your soup base is just for cooking - you're NOT going to pour it back over noodles.  3) As your base warms to boil, go to the condiment buffet and pick up stuff you would like. I had done some youtubing beforehand, so I used a couple of sauce recommendations from there, but really my favorite was the (only) one the restaurant provided (on the glass of the buffet server). Another one I liked is a \"traditional\" sauce from some province in China: 1 ladle sesame paste + 1 spoon chive paste. 4) While your base is still warming up, or if you took forever to get your \"extras\" like me, I added scallions, chili oil, cilantro, and garlic. I wanted to \"spruce up\" the mushroom base soup. It smelled fine, but I do like a \"little\" heat (like a level 1 on 5). The yelpers scared me on the heat levels from the \"Kimchi\" and \"Szechuan.\" Someone mentioned asking for a level one, but this was not an option during my visit. My extras on the \"mushroom\" broth ended up perfect for me. In fact, as a salt loving American, once the broth condensed a little, it was a knock out! 5) Next, add hard veggies. Now there are NO signs to tell you how long to cook anything. I think I let the broccoli cook for 4-5 min - a tad too mushy. The corn was 20 min - ok. The fish and shrimp balls, fried tofu, soft tofu were 1-2 min - they were fine for me and surprisingly tasted better than the chicken. \"Fish ball\" sounds \"fishy\" to me, but they were flavorful and a nice chew (kinda like a softer matzo ball). I never used the soft veggies (leaves). 6) Then, the meat. The server mentioned 30 secs - 1 min for the raw chicken slice. It does change color enough to notice if it's still raw, but I made sure to kill it a little extra. Chopsticks: to kill the chicken bacteria, redip the chopsticks in the boiling soup. In fact, I LEFT them in the boiling soup for the 1 min that my chicken was cooking. The fake crab and some weird white shaved \"fish\" (?) slices took about 20 sec to cook. I was NOT coordinated enough to time all this perfectly the first time out, so I just cooked one or two things at once then ate as they were coming out (Redip those chopsticks FREQUENTLY). 7) Once I got all my goodies cooked and eaten. I went for the ramen noodles (2 min), adding fresh chili oil, scallions, garlic, and cilantro for the cooking and post-cooking. By this point the corn was ready, and I added it to the noodles. Great noodles! 4/5  Cons: Contrary to other reviews, on my visit, there were no eggs and no fresh fruit. I wish they had an extra list of how to make sauces - since we did go to cook our food, I like having recipes! I would also like something to tell me how long to cook the items. Again the recipe thing. Lunch price has increased (from yelp reviews) - $12/person + $1.50 for a can of coke.  Overall: Fun and tasty. But it's only as good as YOUR cooking that day. 3.5/5  Ps. for those of you like me, I did NOT get food poisoning!"}
{"text":"I've tried hot pot in Chicago, California, Texas, overseas, and now Madison, and this place is really sticking out! ...Because of their chili sauce! Never had I ever had this smoke flavored chili sauce before! Amazing!   A seafood hot pot lunch was around $35 for 2 people (without tip). We got the predetermined seafood lunch meal and a couple a la carte items which was filling.   I knocked it down 1 star just because the place can use a facelift and a stronger dish washer.   There are other decently priced prefixed meals for lunch and dinner. I would love to come back to try the meat options!"}
{"text":"Vincent is the gracious owner of an authentic Hot Pot. The broth was exquisite. His family arrives in the  early morning to prepare the delicious broths. I suggested buying whole carrots to juillene, instead of the little finger ones, my only issue. His wife helped me mix a sauce up and gave me pointers on Hot Pot eating, very cool. I got the mushroom broth with veg. Plate for dinner and was very happy."}
{"text":"Fun place. they give you a ton of food and the noodle/potato/sauce bar helps to minimize clutter on the small tables. if you like spicy, i would go for either the szechuan or the thai style broths. i was curious about the coconut curry broth but it was underwhelming. spent too much time trying to add various sauces and spices to the broth. would be curious to go back to see if they would give me a bowl of mixed coconut curry/thai shrimp broth b/c that's what i ended up doing at the table."}
{"text":"Once you get thru how to order what comes out will be well worth the confusion. Almost walked out because I could understand the menu but the person working convinced me to stay. So glad I stayed the most flavorful broth I have ever had came out n I got to eat it with endless amounts of noodles and other wonderful ingredients."}
{"text":"Not much to add to the loads of reviews already posted. This was our first visit and we had a good time. As newbies we needed a little orientation, which the staff cheerfully provided.   Check your broth and protein choices on the plastic menu card with the provided markers. I can recommend the Szechuan broth if you like that tingly sensation. Then concoct a dipping sauce at the condiment bar using some of the many options.    When your hotpot is bubbling you are ready to cook your chosen meat and other items as you see fit. The thin sliced beef and pork cooks completely in moments and is ready to dip and eat. The veggies take longer. The noodles from the bar are parcooked and ready to eat after warming up in the pot.   Five stars for the nice service. They came around to top off the broth, and kept the water glasses full. The interior is spartan but clean. The prices on the menus are confusing. There are weekday lunch prices, and stickers that contradict what's printed on the menu. Our hotpots on a Saturday afternoon were $15.95 each. Fair enough!"}
{"text":"Good portions. Eat here a few times a month. The service is really good. Everyone is nice and helpful every single time I've been there."}
{"text":"This place was really really great! I would recommend the Szechuan broth even though it's the spiciest. Eggs, noodles, and sauce are free/unlimited so take advantage of that!  As someone who is not amazing with spice (I can handle it but not to ridiculous levels), it was not bad at all. If you get lettuce/spinach as a side and let it soak in the broth, it is going to be pretty spicy - but for meat, mushrooms, etc. it is perfect!  It is pretty expensive, and I would NOT recommend getting the combo. I got that the first time I went and it was way too much food. They bring you the meat and a sample tray of veggies/meats/other foods and it was more than enough. It ended up coming to around $18 and I only finished just over a half of it.  If you know what you like, pick your broth/meat and a few other items and hopefully save some money!"}
{"text":"A place we will definitely visit again. The owners were very nice and attentive. My husband, son and I went here for dinner. We tried the spicy szechuan broth, spicy kimchi broth, and the tomato broth for my son. Hands down, the szechuan is the best although it may be too spicy for some palettes. Let me just say, the combos are huge! No need to order extra sides because it will be more than enough."}
{"text":"An great place for individual hot pots for the winter!   We came in around 12pm for lunch, and we were seated without wait. On weekends, there are no lunch deals so it's around $16 per person.   The menu is very cool and had a variety of soup bases and meat choices. Usually the meal combo is enough for each person. After you order, most definitely hit up the salsa bar to mix your own hot pot sauce (very authentic). I personally recommend using the Taiwanese bbq sauce as your base, since it's very authentic and it's what we did at home in Taiwan.   The soup, meat, and combo plates came very quickly. We cooked everything ourselves and sampled every soup base. The spicy soup were definitely more flavorful. The meats and combo plates are good portions and we enjoyed everything!   Definitely recommend for a cold winter hot pot!"}
{"text":"I've found my hot pot go to spot! Great variety of broths to choose from and plenty of protein, veggies, noodles to keep you happy. The owners are so accommodating and polite. Love this place!  I usually go for the mushroom broth with pork combo. The make your own sauce buffet is awesome. I've already been twice and will most likely be returning weekly."}
{"text":"will go again, good for families and friends in winter. The waiters are nice."}
{"text":"Wow this place is great!  So different. So interesting.  The flavors, which you select and create are amazing.  Just recommend cooking your own, and then letting it cool!  And maybe add sauce to broth.  We had everything, and it was ALL good!!! Come. Enjoy."}
{"text":"For people who know hot pot, guys, this place is too legit to quit!!!! For those who haven't had hot pot, the rest of this review is for you:   Do you enjoy spicy broth and eating discrete items? Would you like a nice hot meal on a cold rainy day? Are you a naturally slow eater and wish your meal would stay hot at your leisure? Ever had the unique experience of slurping piping hot noodle soup to sweat out an even hotter summer? If these things apply to you...do I need to tell you to read on?   For those new to hot pot, aka shabu shabu, aka Chinese fondue, it might seem scary at first. There is no compromise here at Mini Hot Pot, although the servers are kind and willing to help. The one nontraditional aspect that stands out is you get your own personal pot instead of a family-style cauldron, but personal pots are more in vogue these days. All you need is to embrace your inner capitalist and individualist!!  I recommend getting one of the set meals. You can always come back and order items a la carte, but it's just simpler if you haven't been here before. There's a range of options including seafood and vegetarian, but if you're omnivore go with beef or pork. Select the broth you want -- the Szechuan is not for the weak (\"spicy numb\" hot). As you're waiting for your ingredients to arrive, head over to the self serve station to create your own dipping sauce. Everyone has their own way; for me, I go with half a ladle each of sesame paste and Taiwanese bbq sauce, a dab of hoisin, a pinch of cilantro and green onion, a splash of soy sauce and vinegar, and a few dribbles of sesame oil. You'll figure it out. Pick up an empty plate too, and head back to your seat.   Hot pot is all about timing. Once your plate of goodies arrive, put in the heartier looking stuff like the corn, tofu, nappa cabbage, fish cakes, and mini hotdogs. The extra plate you have serves as a holding station for goodies freshly pulled from the broth, to cool off before eating, or to avoid overcooking. Stuff you want to be careful about leaving in the pot too long include: spinach, imitation crab leg, vermicelli, and those ribbons of beef or pork you ordered.       When done cooking, dip your items into your sauce and enjoy. For those leveling up on sauce, bring a raw egg from the self serve station back to your seat, and using the two halves of your cracked egg shell, separate the egg white into your boiling pot for eating later. Plop the yolk into your sauce dish, and stir.  If your soup boils down and gets too salty, ask the servers for more broth. Don't forget the noodle bar, which is part of the set meal. They have rice noodles, vermicelli (sweet potato), and udon (wheat). This step is key for people who don't get full easily. Pile some onto a plate, dunk in broth and enjoy. Finally, in true Chinese tradition, top your meal off with some fresh fruit, it was strawberries the day I went, and voila! Mini Hot Pot experience accomplished."}
{"text":"Okay.  So this is some of the best food... and one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in madison.... till the very end when I found a really long hair in my food...  I pulled it out right in front of the host and he didn't acknowledge it.  This is the only thing preventing me from giving them 5 stara.  Aside from that that- the broth was flavorful, the veggie plate plentiful, and noodle and continent bar very generous. The great thing about this style of cooking is the evolution of the flavors.  As you add things and take them out the flavor palate changes, grows."}
{"text":"We decided to try Double 10 Mini Hot Pot for an early dinner this past weekend. We had heard good things about Double 10 so were excited to visit. I was pleased that it exceeded all my expectations.  The location is in a strip mall on Park Street. Once inside, the restaurant is open, airy, and pretty plain. We were greeted immediately, welcomed, ushered to a table, and asked if we had had Hot Pot previously. Although my partner and I have, my sister and her husband had not. Our hostess explained how to order and said they would walk us through it when ready. We all ordered a combination platter and selected our protein and broth. There were I think around ten broths to choose from. Our hostess checked with each of us to see what spiciness level we wanted.  While our plates were being prepared, we checked out the sauce bar. It includes various prepared sauces as well as ingredients like garlic, cilantro, and chilis which you can add to each sauce. Valuable to us, it included a recipe for a dipping sauce which was fantastic! Coming up with my own sauce was daunting. Following the recipe to make this delicious sauce was awesome. There were also eggs, noodles, potatoes, sweet potatoes, and rice noodles which you could add to your hot-pot. Strainers were available which you could use to help lift your food out of your hot-pot.  Soon our hot-pots were delivered to our table. Each person has their own hot-pot and burner. Our host set our hot-pots to heat, explained what each ingredient in our combination plate was and offered tips on how long to cook each item.  The ingredients were all fresh and plentiful. The flavor in my szechwan broth was delicious and the perfect spice level. (I drank quite a bit of the broth when I was done w/my meal.) As I mentioned before the dipping sauce was outstanding.The noodles were hard to pull out of the broth and I didn't care for my partner's coconut broth which I found bland, but other than that is was a fun and delicious meal.  I've been to other hot-pot restaurants and the service and quality of this experience really set it apart. Our host and hostess checked up on us multiple times, they explained what to do and answered questions and made suggestions. Everything we needed was there. This was a great experience and I can't wait to go back and do it again."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful experience. The people that owned double ten bought mini hot pot and are now offering both at this location. We did not try the hot pot, but instead ordered off of the traditional Chinese menu. We shared six dishes, and each one was absolutely perfect. My brother has traveled through China, and this is definitely the most authentic Chinese cuisine we have tried in Madison. Go give it a shot, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have quite a few hotpot places in Madison but this one is one of its kind. I liked the individualized version of it. The colorful menu explains clearly what you need to do. We had lunch here and the selection was good. We chose Schzwan spicy broth and a kimchi broth. The sauces and sides u can select had a good variety as well. We had garlic, scallions, potatoes and rice noodle to add. The broth came to the table hot, it took seconds to boil. It's not a broth u want to drink up though but it flavored the ingredients well.   We would come again for dinner to see the difference. Price wise- lunch was reasonable at $11.95 or $13.95 for seafood selection.   Service was good as well. I am not used to waitress coming to table asking how u liked the food so it was a pleasant surprise.   While we were there, the restaurant filled up fast. Most of them seemed like they have been there before. It's exterior doesn't do much justice to the inside. It was clean neat place. If u like hotpot- u must give this place a try."}
{"text":"I came across this place from Yelp. Stopped by on the way road tripping. I loved everything, food,service, atmosphere, parking space, etc.  I liked the fact that they have a make your own dipping sauce bar so you can try different things. I originally got the Szechuan soup base but it was too herby and spicy for me so I later got the mushroom soup which was perfect. The server wade so nice keep checking on everybody. People who work here are all so friendly. It was so casual atmosphere that somebody can watch a movie on their IPad and eat ha. Love it!  The food was so delicious and fresh. Loved the thin slice pork...very tasty. The suggested dipping sauce recipe was yummy (They put the recipe on the dipping sauce bar so u just follow what they say)  Highly recommended! Worth the price. I was stuffed and happy!!!"}
{"text":"Was a great visit. Food tastes great. Quantity good, feels really good. Environment good for family."}
{"text":"Good, simple food. Since I've never eaten anything like this before, the staff was gracious enough to explain everything down to what some of the was and how to cook it!  Excellent!  Easy to get to and a local feel."}
{"text":"I've never done the little hot pot thing but mostly order take out.   Honestly they have pretty great food overall and awesome service.   The first time I went - I asked for chopsticks and pointed towards the decorative chopsticks on the counter. The woman behind the counter was like - uh those are for decoration but here you can have a pair anyway as long as you promise to be a repeat customer.   Good thing this place is awesome or I wouldn't be able to keep that promise lmao."}
{"text":"Did the restaurant change owners? The front desk is now in the back by the kitchen and the menus have been redone. The prices have gone up another $1-$2 per hotpot and the initial offerings of the starter plate is meager compared to what used to be offered in the past. I noticed the workers referring to the menu several times.   I ordered the thai hot sour broth and it was mixed with the szechwan spicy broth. Pepper flakes filled the pot and I wasn't up to eating something spicy due to being sick from a cold. The buffet cart of sauces and noodles is still available.   My milk bubble tea came straight out of the fridge...yum...premade and soggy tapioca bubbles.   We were given an extra starter plate and had it taken away after the hot pot came out. That plate was placed back into the fridge!"}
{"text":"I went to Madison for a getaway trip. Finding a Chinese restaurant with a good review is pretty hard as most have low ratings. I am glad that I chose Mini Hot Pot. It tastes pretty great and the owner is awesome and friendly.  The one thing I don't like is that some items for the hot pot are over priced. For example, the $1.95 vegetable plate only has a few leaves and the $1.95 mushroom plate only has three small mushrooms.  However, there are some free stuff. Noodles, potatoes are free.  Overall, good choice in Madison."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday for lunch with the boyfriend, we where quickly seated given menus and water, it was instant swear I didn't even see the women do it. We must have looked at the menu funny because she explained how things worked. She even helped me with my noodles and make my dipping sauce. It was fantastic! Our food came out quickly, I got the pork with tomato broth, the bf got beef I don't remember his broth. We will be back for sure and very soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very friendly service. It isn't ramen or pho, but a very intensely flavored broth. You get a side plate (that is huge) full of meats and veggies to cook in the broth, and a sauce and noodle bar that is all-you-can-eat. The broth is served in a metal pot which boils on an induction plate in the table. The experience is as great as the food."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Friendly staff! Great experience all around! The sesame chicken was amazing! A+++"}
{"text":"I visited this place during lunch special time with my wife.  We ordered $10 lunch special.  My wife ordered beef with hot soup.  I ordered lamb with curry soup.  The restaurant does not look any fancy and nice.  However, the table top warmer was good and the lunch was incredibly good.  Also we could bring noodle, additional veggies and sauces from the little bar.  The meat was fresh and the soup tasted good.  The visit surely changed our best Chinese restaurant selection in town."}
{"text":"I have wanted to go to this place for a long time, and I am very happy with my experience. I had the mushroom broth and the veggie platter with scallops on the side. I will say that the scallops were not the best - very fishy - but everything else was delicious. My husband got the spicy broth which was VERY spicy. We eat hot sauce quite a bit, but this was even too hot for him, so he had to rely on his dipping sauce for cooling his mouth.  I would definitely make this a regular spot for date night. It's fun and interactive, and the staff are very helpful!"}
{"text":"The lunch special is a great deal, it comes with vegies, meat of your choice, and beef/fish balls. 3 kinds of noodles are also available. It's a lot of food for one person... as a matter of fact, i never finish the whole thing. And it's only $10!"}
{"text":"This place rocks - staff are friendly, owner is super helpful and the experience of dropping your food in your own \"Hot-Pot\" is super cool and fun. I can't wait to get back here and try another dish!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Food was delicious!! A must visit place to come and eat if living and or visiting!! Quick and friendly service to boot!!"}
{"text":"This place was just as good as one I visited in Hawaii. I have not found one with tomato broth any where in Chicago. My friends first time with a hot pot loved her mushroom broth beef combo. Small place only non Asian people there."}
{"text":"Service was good and the lunch price definitely makes it a great deal. We went during dinner time so the price was average. The meat portion and quality was decent but I was slightly disappointed with the kimchi broth and the portion for vegetables. It might just be a personal reference, but the broth wasn't as flavorful and was a bit on the oily side. Overall, I think this food is okay and decent enough if you come here for lunch."}
{"text":"Update - -5/30/17--prices are up for lunch to $13.95.  Serving sizes have shrunken noticeably. There seems to have been a chef or ownership change as well.  My Szechuan hot pot broth was not up to par and service was a little abrupt. New faces.  Five prior Yelp stars. Alas, now, three.   If I was new to it, I would not make a trip or detour off of the road to stop here. But I will return at least for another visit or two out of my strong feelings of loyalty.  But I am starting to consider looking elsewhere for a new love, fickle as I am.  I deeply regret that I can no longer strongly recommend for other than a novelty or to reminisce."}
{"text":"Great find. Our waitress I'm guessing own was very friendly and helpful. You get tons of food for the price. For my boyfriend and I it was around 50$ but we felt like it was worth it (which hardly happens). Fun experience and will be back.  I had the kimichi broth which is a bit spicy, and beef with shrimp. The shrimp are huge, and you get a pile of beef and some veggies. Next time I may try the mushroom broth and just get a double order of the shrimp."}
{"text":"This place has the best atmosphere. The food is delicious. Everyone there is super friendly, and you feel like they have invited you into their home for dinner.  The food is always fresh. The hot pot broths are all fantastic and very flavorful."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have tried in the past few months in Madison. It is authentic hot pot from what I can tell--(the only other place I've had hot pot is in inner Mongolia) and is a fun concept/date night.   Very vegetarian friendly, I got the mixed vegetable (yu choy, 3 types of mushroom, 3 types tofu, napa cabbage)--it was enough for 2+ people.   There are an assortment of broths to choose from. I tried the Szechuan, which was spicy, a bit oily, but delicious. Next time I would like to try the coconut.   They have a noodle/sauce bar so you can amend your creation (ramen were the best noodle, but they have rice noodles as well). The restaurant is family owned and operated--they are very friendly and accommodating.  They also have bubble tea. Try it!"}
{"text":"My first time trying a hot pot was here. It was a bit overwhelming at first, since I had no idea how it worked. It was delicious. I had kimchi-based broth, eggs, and squid. The only downside was the service. It wasn't bad, but was very slow and I was the only one there. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to get hot pot in Madison, then this is it! You get your own mini hot pot instead of a big communal one. There are different broths to choose from, I got the spicy Szechuan last time which was indeed spicy. You get a lot of food if you choose the combo so come with an empty stomach or you could probably even share between two people. I ordered the lamb combo and it came with an entire plate of lamb and then another plate of veggies and other hot pot goods like tofu and fish balls. They have a bar where you can get noodles and make your own sauces (as much as you like). They even have eggs! Crack an egg into your hotpot and poach it to your own liking. It's the best part about the hot pot I think.  The prices are pretty good and very affortable during lunch time as they have a lunch special. The place is run by a couple and their daughter (I'm assuming) last time I went. They are very friendly. I love supporting small family operations like this. What a cool addition to the Madison food scene."}
{"text":"This was a lovely find. We'd never had Hot Pot before but I've always wanted to try it. Passing through Madison, we found this place on Yelp. We were not disappointed. The staff was kind to us newbies and the food was delicious.  We had the Seafood and Chicken Hot Pots with Mushroom broth (our kiddo isn't into spicy sadly). Great experience, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Really liked the mushroom broth. Motivated us to buy our own hot pot, though, so not sure how often we'll be back... it's a bit expensive to eat it outside. Love the humid, warm, atmosphere in here though, esp. in winter!"}
{"text":"Good for sharing, or longer dinners/dates. Madisons best hot pot place I have tried. Some sauces are pretty salty, be careful how much you put in the broth.   A little pricey, but they have better prices for lunch.   Very friendly and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Amazing place with friendly helpful staff! I've never had a hot pot before but as a lover of Pho I had to try this place! The veggies are fresh and the broth was on point! I'll definitely be back!!! Happy I found this place to eat at while working in Madison! If you're even thinking about this place as an option just try it you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Best hot pot I've had in the US so far ( I've only gone to three). People were also very friendly there."}
{"text":"Very tasty hot pot and dinner had huge portions. Lots of selections.  I had the kimchi hot pot.  Lots of stuff to cook in it and noodles to finish it as a soup.  I second Vicki T's vote for great place for cold weather.  Slow meal taking with friends over steaming pot of broth."}
{"text":"Great place for hot pot! Individual servings, a sauce and noodle bar, and great service. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This was pretty cool: you pick your broth and your meat (or meatless) and make your own ramen/noodle soup bowl right on a hot plate at your table. The servers will help you through the entire process and even make your dipping sauce if you need them to!"}
{"text":"Very nice hot pot restaurant, they do a great job here with options and organization. If you're new or experienced with hot pot this a a great option for you as this is their main thing.  If you are new, you pick your broth, sauces, and ingredients then cook it in the broth at your table. There are stove tops where you sit, your sever will detail you on what you need to do. Watch a few videos if you still need clarity.  The spicy broth was excellent, they balanced it correctly compared to some bad that I've had in the past. As I mentioned this place is very organized and everything was very laid out so you can have the best dining experience possible. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"What a fun and unique experience!  I've been here a handful of times and each time I go I feel like I'm slowly mastering this process.  Don't hesitate to let one of the waitstaff help you figure things out if you're a first timer!  You can't go wrong with any of their delicious broth options - I particularly love the mushroom with its strong umami flavors.  I think I've always ordered the combo, which lets you choose your meat (I get the pork) which comes to the table slightly frozen along with a myriad of recognizable (& unrecognizable) accoutrements.  Then go to the \"sauce bar\" to mix your dipping sauce and grab some extra add-ins like noodles, eggs and sweet potato slices.  Then start cooking - your broth is waiting for you on a built-in table burner that keeps your soup boiling while you add in your fixins.  Use your dipping sauce to dunk your freshly cooked meat and veggies into.  Fun and delicious!  If you like DIY style dining experiences, check this place out."}
{"text":"I love Mini Hot Pot! It's delicious! Great service and the owner is very kind! He always helps us pack our leftover broth home. The Thai sour soup is my favorite!  A tip I would give is to order a la carte and pick your own broth and sides, meat/veggies. I usually do beef, anoki mushrooms, and Chinese veggies. I can't wait to eat at Mini Hot Pot again! :)"}
{"text":"F*CK YEAH MINI HOT POT!  I went with a friend one week night and we were the only non-asians. It is called mini hot pot because each person gets their own hotpot instead of sharing. I was not used to this so my friend and I shared one small hotpot. We got 2 kinds of meat and a veggie plate and it was too much food.   There is a buffet area set up where you can help yourself to every delicious asian sauce imaginable and extras like various noodles, cilantro, eggs, and orange slices for dessert. The sauces are for you to mix in your bowl to make a special sauce to dip your hot pot items in after they have been cooked in the broth.  Overall an affordable, fun and delicious experience! I will be back! As others have mentioned, the owner is very nice. I have had hot pot in China and this is definitely on par with that!"}
{"text":"Love this place. If you can't tell, my standard for Chinese food is how well a restaurant can do in the SGV in LA. And this restaurant would do quite well.   The owners are very friendly. The menu is lacking in English explanations, but they are more than happy to explain to you how the menu works. One side of the menu is lunch and one side of the menu is the regular hot pot menu.   If you've never had hot pot, the idea is a pot of broth is placed on your individual hot plate. You put raw veggies, thinly sliced meat, tofus, and whatnot into the simmering pot of broth. Wait for it to cook, then fish it out with your chopsticks or spoon, dip in some sauce and enjoy. If you've ever had the entree fondue at Melting Pot, it's that idea, but hot pot came first.   For the hot pot menu, you can either order a soup base (5-6 different flavors including a mushroom broth, a szechuan spicy broth, and a spicy thai broth), and then pick the \"side orders\" you'd like to have for your hot pot, like meats, vegetables, tofus, etc. The soup base is about $5, and most of the side orders are about $2. But the better deal is the combo. With the combo, you have your choice of soup base, along with a particular meat, and it comes with a combination veggie plate that includes a variety of items like spinach, napa cabbage, tofu, enoki mushrooms, lapchang, corn, fish balls, and more. The combo is only $15 at night, and I believe they have a lunch special version for $10. There's also an all vegetarian combo, which you can order with a mushroom broth.  The sauces are on the side, and they're plentiful: minced garlic, cilantro, green onions, hoisin sauce, soy sauce, peanut sauce, fermented tofu sauce, oyster sauce, etc. There are also eggs and noodles for the end of your hot pot, but I didn't get a chance to partake because I was so full.   The broth was so flavorful and delicious. I ordered the Szechuan spicy broth and it was certainly spicy. If you're not a spice person or only like a little bit spice, I wouldn't go with this one. Both my dining partner and I really enjoyed this meal. The service was fast (they keep the broth ready, and you do much of the cooking yourself), and very well priced. They're a bit of a trek being on Park Street, but they are well worth it."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go if you want authentic Chinese food (most dishes are traditional food from northeastern region in China) and their mini hot pot is decent. Best Chinese food in town imo."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations for this place, but I didn't know where else to get hot pot. The place is very easy to miss since the sign is a super generic red and yellow Chinese restaurant sign in a small plaza next to Copps. Don't let this scare you off; it's a genuinely great place!  Before arriving, I read that they had free WiFi, so I brought my laptop to watch anime on assuming that I would take a long time to eat (since hot pot is a very relaxed, not rushed kind of meal). Instead of your typical rude Chinese restaurant staff, I was greeted by a friendly man and a friendly woman which instantly gave a ma and pa feel from the get go. They seated me right away.  I ordered a beef and vegetable combo with szechuan broth. The combo said that it would come with vegetables and your choice of meat, so I was expecting this to not be such a great deal for $14.95. I was so wrong!  They gave me a big plate of frozen beef slices that what stacked high enough to have trouble not causing a beef avalanche as I grabbed for some. The vegetable plate was actually kind of modest in terms of vegetable selection: corn on the cob, spinach, enyoki mushrooms, and nappa cabbage. However, the \"vegetables\" also included clams, imitation crab, thai fish cake, fish balls, beef balls, spam, sausage, rice cake, firm tofu, fried fish cake tofu, and probably some more stuff that I don't remember. As an added bonus, they had unlimited noodles (and three different kinds), unlimited raw eggs, and unlimited small oranges to eat after dinner. They also had 16 different sauces and toppings. I added minced garlic, cilantro, and green onion to my broth then used barbecue sauce, sesame sauce, and fermented tofu for dipping.  I took my sweet time; I slowly cooked my hot pot ingredients and watched three episodes of anime while I doing it. I think I just found my new favorite alone time activity!  I found the flavor of the broth to be a little too salty (nothing water can't fix) but also very savory. The szechuan peppercorns didn't leave a sour numb taste in my mouth, and I'm grateful for that because it usually bothers me.  In case you were wondering, they do not have an all you can eat deal. However, I found the beef combo to be plenty of food even for me, and I'm a 240 lb powerlifter with a big appetite who came here immediately after a lift.  Even though I'm giving Mini Hot Pot five stars, I did wish that there were some things different about the place. First of all, you can't order other foods during dinner time; all they serve is hot pot! Before I knew how huge my hot pot was going to be, I was hoping I could order some sort of appetizer like crab rangoon or dumplings. Secondly, I wish the combo included watercress and more mushrooms. Finally, I wish they had whole cilantro available. I like to add cilantro as a vegetable to my hot pot. If they have it chopped as a free topping, surely they can provide it without be chopped too.  However, all those pieces of criticism are minor. Mini Hot Pot has a really special experience to offer. I've had lots of hot pot and shabu shabu in Chicago and San Francisco, but I'd rather go to Mini Hot Pot over all of those places because I've never had a more customizable and inviting hot pot experience. With such a big focus on restaurants near the capitol or on Willy Street, it's easy to miss this gem. I encourage all Madison foodies to visit Mini Hot Pot, especially if you have never tried hot pot before!  Hope you enjoyed my brain dump!"}
{"text":"I honestly love this restaurant. I come here probably once every two weeks or whenever on a rainy day. Service is great. Family owned restaurant. One of the owners is a woman that always works in the front. She's awesome! Probably the sweetest lady ever even though she doesn't speak much English. The food you get is at a great price & good quality. You also get an unlimited noodle & condiment bar. Whereas many other hot pot places I've been to in the past, you have to pay extra for noodles & sauces. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I chose Double 10 Mini Hot Pot based on good Yelp rating and nearness to our hotel. The food and experience was far more than I expected. We were recognized as newcomers and got plenty of friendly helpful guidance for preparing a tasty dipping sauce and for cooking our hot pot dinner at the table. Highly recommend and wish I didn't live 6 states away!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and hotpot is really perfect for the cold weather! It was nice to have individual heaters/pots so you can choose your own broth and spice level. No complaints on the broth/food. Its good for Madison, but doesn't compare to the real deal.   Although the set courses on the menu are nice and give you a taste of everything, you have to look on your plate and the menu picture/description to make you're getting everything you're supposed to. With a group of 6 who ordered essentially all the same dishes, each one came with something missing so just keep an eye out for it."}
{"text":"I had Pork Hot Pot with Korean soup, it was good! Single hot pot is still big for one. Staff is nice and friendly. We enjoyed their food. Little bit pricy."}
{"text":"I've come here several times since this time. I'm still satisfied with lunch.  Dinner here is pretty pricey (though there is more meat and egg for dinner) and unfortunately, I feel the quality of the food has gone down (less variety of veggies and more lettuce), and everything is frozen before it is served. It's still a good place to go to for hotpot and I will still frequent this place, but honestly I've been a little disappointed recently."}
{"text":"Hot pot and menu items are both great! Ask for help if you are a new to the hot pot experience."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants in town! I'm sad that their prices went up right as we went there but it is still so good! It's hard to find hotpot in America and this place really hits the spot! The family is super nice and the atmosphere is chill. The mushroom soup base is my favorite. It's a really nice touch that they give you unlimited noodles so you never leave feeling hungry (I seldom can finish all the food they give me). You would be missing out not to come here."}
{"text":"Why share when you can have your own mini hot pot! That is why it is called mini hot pot because each seat has its own burner. This place is great. The owners are super welcoming and sweet. You get a ton of food for the price. And there is a bar with extra condiments, noodles to soak up all that broth goodness, and oranges for a healthy dessert.  I did the Szechaun broth which is quite spicy but delicious. My friend go the mushroom broth which tasted super mushroomy to me after I had been dipping in the Szechaun broth for awhile. I wasn't super impressed by the quality of beef but it served it's purpose. I liked my friend's chicken more but they were more a fan of my beef, so maybe it just all comes down to preference. I plan on going back for the their snow crab leg, I've never had that in a hot pot before!"}
{"text":"Just moved from California to Wisconsin, and suddenly missed all of my asian food back home, especially hot pot! This is the only hot pot in Madison so I decided to take a risk and try it out! This is very close to the real deal as you could possibly get. Ordering is not as confusing as you think. You just pick your broth, meat, veggies. And then you make your own dipping sauce in the sauce station. Service was great. I mean this is not as great as what I eat in CA but I am definitely not complaining, this will be my go-to restaurant for when I'm missing home or just a great place to eat when it gets colder."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 7 for lunch on a Sunday. We arrived right when they opened at 11 and they were able to accommodate our large party; otherwise it can get pretty crowded. All of us ordered the lunch hot pot special. You can choose from a non-spicy mushroom broth or a spicy Szechuan broth. Each person has their own hot pot and burner. You select a protein (chicken, lamb, beef or pork) and it comes with a giant plate of veggies and other goodies (fish balls, rice cake, tofu, enoki mushroom, etc). You only get about 6 slices of meat but it's more than enough. I think I was the only one who finished their whole plate. In addition to the meat and veggies, you can get unlimited noodles (there are 3 different kinds) to cook in your broth. There is also a condiment bar where you can make your own custom dipping sauce. All of this came to $9.95/person. It's a really great deal for lunch, plus cooking your own food is kind of fun!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite hotpot place in town. I love that everyone can get what they want because everyone gets their own pot and I love the make-your-own-sauce bar, which also has noodles, eggs, potatoes, and sweet potatoes up for grabs as well! My favorite broth is their Thai one. This place can be kind of confusing to newcomers so go with someone that's been here before if you can. The seating is also very limited; if it's raining or around mealtime or you're celebrating a special occasion, try to go early to make sure your party can get some seats."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb, and I'm Asian. Why this is a good place to try hotpot if you are a first timer or non-Asian:  1. You don't have to deal with the gross idea of sharing a single pot with a table and everyone sticking their germs into your hotpot.  2. And you don't have to have conflicts with what flavored soup to get when sharing. Everyone gets their own!  3. The menu is simple and pretty American-friendly. They don't give you weird Asian ingredients like livers/intestines, so you can order freely without worrying about eating something you are uncomfortable with 4. There's a salad bar at the back where you can get noodles and basic veggies! Awesome, places often charge for that."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in town. The lady that runs the front of house is incredibly polite and helpful. The food has always been good here. So far I have eaten mostly hot pot, but everything has been good.   I just tried the regular menu. I'm not sure which is better! I had spicy pork and tea egg. The flavors of both dishes were off the charts. The customer service here is always bloody fantastic. And I always leave full to the gills with a great taste on my pallet. Just an amazing restaurant. And what better hours? Every day from 11-10. Life gets no better, friends."}
{"text":"I love hot pot and this is a great place for it! The woman running the place today was so helpful with helping mix all kinds of yummy sauces. She was great and the food was amazing! Highly recommend! So many choices of broth!!!"}
{"text":"Update: We went again with another group of friends for lunch. This time I had the Thai Spicy Broth. I thought it was soo much better than the Singapore Coconut Broth. Wasn't that spicy (I'm a wuss when it comes to spice. I'll order no spice on anything that has an option of level of spice). Two friends had the Szechuan Broth. That one is rated three peppers. While flavorful, I knew if I had picked that one, I wouldn't be able to eat anything because the spice level would upset my stomach."}
{"text":"Two words: Love it.   Don't be fooled by the looks for there's not much of an interior design. However, the service is warm, generous and attentive. It outshines its fondue/shabu shabu competitors by allowing each diner his own mini-pot and a buffet selection to make your own sauces. You'll never grudge over compromising your selection of broth or meat out of consideration for your dining partner(s). This format also helps to eliminate cross contamination and flavor mixes. I, for one, cannot stand lamb, so the awkwardness surrounding lamb when ordering in group settings has always been exhausting. They have the solution!   You may order combination platter or a la cart. The combination platter comes with your choice of protein, then veggies and assortment of treats as sides. This option is priced at $11.95 and $15.95 for lunch and dinner, respectively. A variety of cooking broth styles is also included in the price. Please see the attached picture. A la cart prices range from $1.95 to $4.95. My suggestion is to go with the combination platter, since it comes with a lot of the a la cart stuff.   There's also a small buffet which comprises a plethora of spices and sauces for you to mix and match, as well as extra noodles, veggies and proteins at no additional cost.   Overall, I think this concept is clever, unique and fun. The service is always warm and inviting; the food is extremely satisfying, and i sincerely hope that they do well."}
{"text":"The quality of food is good. I got the lamb with the Thai broth. It wasn't very spicy but they allow you to control the flavor with the dipping sauce. They have unlimited noodles but not a huge variety. I would come back. The only negative is the price is on the high side."}
{"text":"Brought my three children for a Sunday night meal and we were so happy with our dinner. Even our I-hate-soup 9 year old loved the food. The proprietors are friendly and the service was great."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite restaurant in Madison and maybe the world. It has become my go to restaurant after moving here 2 years ago. The management is so accommodating and I never leave dissatisfied. I talk about this place at family gatherings. Seriously go and try it. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and lunch. For lunch it was great! Prices, quality and food were superb. We came back for dinner, but I wanted a lunch special item. I asked if it was possible to make it for us, and the waitress special ordered it for us! I will definitely come back and recommend this place to all of my friends. Wonderful service  :)  PS she also called me beautiful while I was extremely sick!"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious hot pots around. I went there yesterday with an acquaintance of mine and got the kimchi broth, YUMMY!!! The broth had the perfect amount of heat and flavor.  I've never been to a hot pot before, I assumed it'd be similar to a Korean barbecue, the setup was similar you have a bar towards the back where you can get additional items like: glass noodles, vermicelli noodles, potatoes, and different spices, but the menu provides the main items for the broth.  The menu has a wide selection it's both meat eater and vegetarian friendly. It's also budget friendly you can select various types of meats at around 2.00 per selection and the portion size is plentiful. In total a meal for two was a little over 30 dollars and if you look at the picture attached you'll see that we definitely got our money's worth."}
{"text":"I love this place. My wife  and I have had dinner here 3 times in 2 weeks and it is not getting old. I first tried the sezchewan broth with beef and my wife has tried the mushroom broth. Both were very good and I also tried the coconut broth with lamb but prefer  the sezchewan over the others. The lady helping us was very nice and guided  us threw the steps on how to prepare your dish. A few tips are noodles cook for 20 sec and meat about 10 to 15 seconds. Also if you ask for a ladle it is very helpful for scooping out your desired items. Also it is boiling hot and you will be tempted to eat right from your hot pot and most likely burn your self. So let it cool a bit and enjoy this awesome meal."}
{"text":"This super popular spot has been on my list of places to visit for a while, and I'm glad I finally decided to try it out! This place is called \"Mini hot pot\" for a reason, since you each get your own personal hot pot, which is pretty different from the traditional large hot pot in the middle that everyone shares. Because of this, the price is on the higher side (~$18 with tax and tip for a beef plate), but you do get quite a lot of food!  The meat itself was delicious, and the mixed vegetables were also great. The service was fairly fast and they have a sauce bar where you can create your own dipping sauce which was pretty neat. They also have unlimited noodles which was awesome!   This place is certainly a more Americanized version of the hot pot I'm used to, but I still really enjoyed the food. I could imagine that this place would really hit the spot on a cold Wisconsin winter day. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very authentic spicy bowl. Super delicious. Highly recommend! My fiancé had hotpot. Being an authentic white guy, he enjoys the general tsao sauce and sweet corn. Lol."}
{"text":"Surprisingly really good! I was expecting a dingy, unclean Chinese restaurant w poor food but this place actually delivered to its high ratings. There's a variety of things to order, even things as uncommon as squid and quail eggs (both of which I recommend). The sauce bar they have is convenient with the staple sauces, sesame, spicy, etc., along with different oils and add-ons like minced garlic. Each person gets their own mini hot pot, which in my opinion is way more enjoyable than the shared hotpot. You still end up sharing food w others, but there's more cooking space and variety.   Their only weak points were the noodles and fish balls; not very high quality but they made up for that with their vegetables, meat, and sauces. Polite service and good prices. This place is great for eating with a huge group, or even just a couple people (though you kinda lose the hot pot feel if you do that). My family is for sure coming back in the future."}
{"text":"Great little shop. The broth is insanely good. Doesnt matter which one you choose they're all good but you cant be wrong with the mushroom broth. If you never been to a hot pot, here's how this one works. You pay per person and you get a pot of broth  and your choice selection of raw meat, veggies and etc. you cook your ingredients on your table.You can get refills of broth but you don't really need another.  Great thing about this place is you can bring home your left overs and you can pay extra to share. About half the regular price! Great spot to go in Madison's cold weather"}
{"text":"Yum yum hot pot. Lots of options. Secret to enjoy is to try out various combinations of the sauces and then stick with one if you are new to the whole hot pot concept.  I had lamb with mushroom broth base."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It's a fun place to bring people from out of town. The hot pot serving is huge and there is always leftovers to take home. I have to say that this is a place where you will find yourself trying something new to you. The variety of veggies and meat that go into the pot is pretty awesome. I'm so excited that it's fall and it's becoming soup weather again! Get creative with your pot and be ok to laughing at yourself. This is a messy meal sometimes and a bib may come in handy! A great way to meet others sitting next to you too!"}
{"text":"Perfect food, kind stuff, super lunch price, great volume,so happy to be there. Will visit again! Mini Hot pot, strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"Asian Comfort Food  Growing up in East Central Wisconsin, I wasn't exposed to decent Asian food in the wayward days of my youth.  My memories of this cuisine sadly consist primarily of overcooked veggies in gloppy brown sauce.  As a result, I tended to shy away from Asian food in my college and young professional days.  However, after recently taking a job on Madison's south side, I've enjoyed a Renaissance of sorts as I've enjoyed the vibrant flavors of dishes from Ichiban, Orient House and recently SoHo Gourmet Cuisine during my lunchtime forays.  But I really didn't experience Asian comfort food until my recent visit to Mini Hot Pot.  Maybe it was the fact I came in soaked from a mid-November rain, maybe it was because I didn't eat much breakfast during my early morning meeting, but my Spicy Pork Bowl was as a soul soothing dish I've consumed in recent memory.  Mini Hot Pot sits in an unpretentious Park Street strip mall next to the Copp's grocery store.  I was immediately greeted by the owner as I entered the restaurant and he expeditiously escorted me to an open table.  The interior of the restaurant (the former home of Mabuhay Philippine) has received a fresh coat of paint and new dark brown flooring.  The restaurant was absolutely spotless, from floor to ceiling.  While there is no booth seating, there are plenty of tables, with built-in heating elements and matching red and black chairs.  While the restaurant offers free wi-fi, I couldn't figure out the password the owner shared with me.  My soft-spoken server appeared soon after I took my seat.  He diligently explained the different menu options, but there was a bit of a language barrier, so I didn't quite comprehend all of the information he was sharing.  I've been pigging out on pork lately, so I zeroed in on the prefabricated Spicy Pork Bowl ($7.95), ordered it spicy, and hoped for the best.  About five minutes later, my server dropped off my order and I immediately fell completely and hopelessly in love.  The aroma from the garlic and ginger in the potent broth immediately snapped my senses to attention.  To the delight of my taste buds, my hot pot was brimming with thick, chewy noodles, thinly sliced pork, plump dumplings and lightly cooked broccoli. I thoroughly enjoyed the all the variety the flavor-packed dish provided.  The restaurant offers three spice level (mild, spicy hot and super spicy) and the medium level provided appreciated heat without blowing out my palette.   While I normally loath Wisconsin winters, these hot pots are going to help my kick Old Man Winter's ass until spring returns to the Badger state.  Throughout the meal, both the owner and the server checked in so see how I liked the meal.  My grin of contentment surely tipped them off that all was well.  They will be seeing plenty of me in the coming months as I explore my way through their menu.  This is yet another fantastic addition to the Park Street dining scene (along with Noosh and El Rancho).  If you're in the area, I highly recommend you pay Mini Hot Pot a visit."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Maybe it was too busy, but we were a little lost with the \"hot pot\" process.  The combos have a TON a food so you won't leave hungry.  Unless half of it ends up on the table or in your lap (as was my case).  The coconut broth was flavorless IMO.  My friends had two of the other choices (forgot which) and they were better.  Not for me."}
{"text":"Atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired (strip mall) but the service is good and the food was great. We were new to the hot pot experience (first time) and had no idea wtf we were doing....not much assistance was offered (would be great if the menu had a bit more information about etiquette or directions/procedure). Despite that we both managed to make absolutely delicious dishes and were pretty proud of ourselves! Would definitely be a fun activity for a date night if you're okay with the fact that you might makes asses of yourselves."}
{"text":"One of my favorite take out places. I'm sure dining in is better in some ways, as you get to dip your own food. But for delivery they cook the stuff for you (lightly steamed) and you can dip it at home though it's not as hot.   Madison is a place where the food often looks better than it tastes - looking at you Sujeo and DLUX - like it's made for Instagram rather than ingestion. Double 10 is a welcome exception. The food is delicious, filling, the Szechuan is actually spicy and they pack your delivery in a way that makes sense, including extras like custom mixed dipping sauce with fresh garlic and cilantro - since you can't go to the condiment station yourself.   This place is a go-to for those cold Wisconsin days."}
{"text":"Our 1st and favorite Hot Pot. 4 of us got 4 different soup base to try for weekday lunch. We were so full, we almost didn't finish it. 3 of us got seafood and 1 meat. Enjoyed the sauce. I also ordered yang chow fried rice and it was also delicious. Price is very reasonable. They're very friendly and even offered to take our picture. I will definitely recommend. Even though we live over an hour away, we'll go back again soon."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  The food is delicious and the employees are very, very nice!  Pan and everyone there are wonderful.  So very gracious and sincere!  Their restaurant is warm and cozy with warming pads right on the tables. Very unique and efficient. And we're excited because they are now in a great location close to us, on S Park St, right next to Pick 'n Save. Try Double 10!  You'll love it, too."}
{"text":"If you're new to \"hot pot\" then this is a good place to start. Everyone gets their own little pot of hot broth to cook in at their own pace. Don't underestimate the amount of food they bring out, you definitely won't be able to finish it all. Worth the experience!  If you're new, this is what to expect when you sit down: pick one of the \"combo plates\" that come with a type of protein (shaved slices of beef or chicken or lamb, you get the idea) and then a broth flavor. My table ordered the spicy broth as well as the Korean kimchi broth and both were delicious and importantly, not too spicy - like a 6 out of 10 spice level. I suggest ordering off the ala carte section and getting udon noodles."}
{"text":"Great place to go if you have adventurous food friends and don't get intimidated by eating over a pot of boiling broth.  Wonderful staff, a real treat that I will be making a regular suggestion for dinner with friends."}
{"text":"As a Chinese myself, I gotta say they serve some authentic northeastern Chinese dishes there. Besides the hot pot has been decent if not the best."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for a pick me up. I always either choose the seafood or just fish fillet option for meat and the Szechwan spicy broth. (That's it) - There are free options for noodles, sauces, and some veggies. I recommend to put potatoes in there, it soaks up the broth so well! They bring a plate of more things to put in along with your choice of meat - corn, bok choy, tofu, other various seafoods and more. Don't worry if you finish your broth quickly, they offer to add more water to it once you're running low!  The staff is super sweet, there's never been a wait for us on the weekend for lunch and it's super unique to have in the Madison community. I highly recommend checking Double 10 Mini Hot Pot out!"}
{"text":"Came here for my first hot pot experience and it did not disappoint! I do recommend getting the spicy broth as my husband tried the mushroom and was underwhelmed ... so he started just cooking everything in mine since it was super yummy! They have a sauce bar which had plenty of choices and I enjoyed making different dipping sauces to find what I liked best. The meat was great quality and they give you a small variety plate with your order of other items to sample as well. We ended up ordering extra mushrooms and broccoli after having the sample! It did seem a little bit pricey compared to other places where I had seen hot pot on the menu but we left happy and stuffed so can't really complain. Will definitely be back when I'm in the Madison area!"}
{"text":"Best hot pot in Madison! The thai sour soup base is the one that I've gotten so far and it's delicious. The service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"A good variety of broth, a good portion of food, lots of sauce to pick from, and as much noodle as you want. Way better than what I would expect from the Midwest."}
{"text":"Love this place! Ive been here countless times now and have not been disappointed. I see a lot of guests who come here expecting a typical Asian restaurant and order plates of food. (Fried rice, kung Pao chicken, etc). It's almost like ordering spaghetti and meatballs at a fine dining steakhouse. Yeah sure it'll be ok, but is that what you really should be ordering for where you're at? I encourage you to try out the hot pot which is what this restaurant is focused on. It may be weird at first but once you figure how it all works I promise it will be something you go back for. I have nothing to complain about and I will continue coming here always. I give it 215 stars!"}
{"text":"Induction heat on your table , very good portions very very good prices for the amount you get, clean very friendly and helpful if u never been here befor. Make your own dipping sauces or follow suggestions."}
{"text":"Was so excited when I found out Madison had a hot pot restaurant! I'd only ever experienced the Convoy St. shabu shabu in San Diego, CA and could not wait to see how this would compare. So...I made plans, met up with my foodie partner in crime and we had lunch there yesterday afternoon. The service was friendly and the food exceeded my expectations.   We each ordered the $9 hot pot lunch special...which comes with a plate overflowing with a variety of vegetables and meats...topped with your primary choice of meat (chicken, beef, pork or lamb). We were also given the option to select our own individual choices of broth. Based on previous reviews, I was torn between the kimchi broth and the Szechwan broth. We each selected the Szechwan spicy broth and ordered a side of scallops and a side of beef balls.   Our individual hot pots were quickly brought out and we were also educated on how to operate the table burners. While our broths heated up, we made our way to the sauce bar towards the back of the restaurant. There was a very nice variety of sauces, fresh herbs, noodles and spices. I grabbed a bowl and made a dipping sauce concoction...no...dipping sauce masterpiece, filled a plate with uncooked noodles and we happily returned to our now boiling broths.  Our meat and vegetables soon followed and we commenced to eating...well, more like commenced to placing our food into the very aromatic boiling broth and then eating.   As it takes a few minutes for your meats and veggies to cook in the broth, there was time for laughing, talking and catching up between two old friends while we dined. The hot pot was wonderful, the service was very friendly, and the prices were very reasonable... I believe this may now be one of my favorite eating spots in Madison!!  Dining Tips:  - Don't forget to look up while you are at the sauce bar. It is very easy to miss the additional sauce and seasoning options sitting just above your head while you're focusing on making your dipping sauce masterpiece. - Make sure to grab an extra plate or bowl from the sauce bar to use as a \"cooling station\" for the items you've removed from your boiling hot pot. *Insert hot pot items directly from the hot pot straight into your mouth at your own risk...lol...very hot!* - Unless you are specifically wanting items such as shrimp or scallops...when ordering the hot pot lunch special...there is really no need to order extra items such as beef balls or veggies...unless of course you just want more than what they are already providing you with. - The Szechwan broth is in fact spicy (which for me...is a good thing) and gets spicier as it cooks...which may not be good for those who can't or don't tolerate spicy foods very well. If spicy hot appeals to you...then you're good to go...but if you're looking for a little less spicy than you may want to opt for one of the other broths instead.   Last but not least....ENJOY!!! I know that I did *Big Smile*"}
{"text":"Doesn't have lunch special anymore. Everything need to order separately. It is not really worth to come here and have an expensive meal."}
{"text":"Hot pot is fun!  I liked that each table had an individual burner so you didn't have to deal with a sterno burner or reach far across the table for your food.  We chose a broth, and a meat (or you can do just veggies) .  All meats come with a large amount of vegetables as well.  I recommend the Szechuan spicy broth. Unfortunately, the coconut broth is 100% coconut broth and a little shredded coconut, which does not add much flavor to your food. I ameliorated the lack of flavor from coconut broth after cooking by using a small bowl in which I added sauce and some spicy broth.   Each plate came with a large bed of bok choy and cabbage and lots of other vegetables, some sausages and tofu.  You can pay a la carte for more add ons but honestly I can't imagine doing so because the regular portion is very large. They bring a separate plate with the thinly sliced meat.  Our server had a little trouble communicating with us through the language barrier, so it's hard to communicate any dietary restrictions (such as if you avoid certain types of meat or gluten, for example).  In the back there's also a wide variety of sauces and some fresh fruit as a dessert.  I'm looking forward to returning and ordering the Szechuan broth and digging in!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to try hot pot for the first time. Many different broth options, personally I get the mushroom broth and love it every time. Theres a sauce creation bar and a fresh noodle bar that you can go up to and help yourself. You will not leave here hungry and can order extra sides if you're still hungry. Service is always excellent here, a fun and great dining atmosphere. Easily became one of my favorite restaurants, love the variety."}
{"text":"For the dinner mini hot pot, you can choose your own soup with meat. There are also other food items to order that you can add it up to your hot pot (seafood!). The restaurant is very comfy, and you get your own mini pot, instead of having to share a big pot with the whole table. Staff are friendly, and service is fast. Nice place to enjoy a nice dinner during the cold weather!"}
{"text":"This is a one of a kind dining experience that is always fun, enjoyable and delicious because the food is consistently good and the service is impeccable. You must experience this hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Made reservation for a party of 10. Table was ready on time, service very prompt. Very cool menu with clearly marked ordering steps. Large selection of proteins and accompanying  side dish has lots of other stuff to cook. We all got different kinds of brotha and made custom dipping sauces.  5 stars across the board: excellent for groups like separating bills, handling the chaos of 10 different orders and delivering quickly. 5 stars for service, 5 stars for price (about $16 each), 5 stars for attentive service that included frequent refilling of water, 5 stars for yummy sauces and overall meal.  3 stars for the restaurant aesthetics ... Just a sparsely decorated room with a bunch of tables that include individual built in hit plates (Very cool). The bathrooms are located down a long corroded that runs behind all of the restaurants. I would give the bathrooms a 2.  I came for hot pot, and it delivered, and hence the 5 stars.  Our college kids will be coming back for the cheaper lunch menu. We all agreed we would visit again."}
{"text":"This is the new location for the old double 10 restaurant on University Avenue. They do individual hot pot, which is great, but for me the biggest and best news is the array of home-style dishes: spicy pork with dried bean curd, eggplant, and delicious homemade steamed dumplings.  We're glad you found a new place, and we're happy to be back!"}
{"text":"Came as a group of 3, none of us have ever experienced hot pot before. Our waitress was absolutely excellent in helping us through the menu and how to go about cooking our food. What a fun lunch! Prices are very fair for the amount and quality you receive, with unlimited sauces and noodles. We met the owner and she was so very kind and you could tell she loves her restaurant. We will definitely be back, and bringing friends!  Restaurant was very clean, noise level was low. By noon on Sunday the place was pretty much full!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating hot pot so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I picked the mushroom soup base with beef and my boyfriend got one of the spicy broths with seafood.  Our meat choices were brought to us a few minutes before the broths arrived at our table and there was a plentiful selection of veggies also.  I added noodles from the self serve bar and it made for a plentiful meal."}
{"text":"Great fast service. Ordered our food and within 10 min, got the broth and meat already. Meat was fresh. Veggies didn't seem to be too fresh.. Kim chee broth was not bad.. not too flavorful but still did the job... will plan to come back for future lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Good place to have some togo food or just sit and do some hot pot. It is fun to eat in winter, not so much during summer season. The owner is 100% from Beijing and I enjoyed talking with him whenever I was there. Food quality has been trending down since grand opening, which is typical but also unfortunate. I have not been there for about 4 months now, so a revisit would help me get updates on this review."}
{"text":"I waver between three and four stars. I love coming here when I crave hot pot. However, the prices here are way more than it is in New York... Although, I guess hot pot is more of a rarity here in the Midwest, so the markup in price is somewhat understandable. It's a fun activity if you haven't done it before!  I do not recommend ordering additional noodles, as in the different kinds of noodles they offer on their menu. They give you a negligible amount, and there's already vermicelli in the buffet station.  For soup base, I think I got the Thai coconut one. It was rather bland. And of course, when they offer to put more broth, it tastes even more bland.   Oh yes, I do like that Double 10 has merged with Mini Hot Pot. Double 10 was my favorite Chinese place in Madison, and I was so bummed when they closed their other location. I got the eggplant in garlic sauce, I loved it and it tasted as it did back at their old location."}
{"text":"I grew up eating hot pot celebrating Chinese holidays. But, eating hot pot is THE best during cold weather. I have never taken the time to get all of the ingredients to do this at home. Why? I'm too lazy to go and get the meat sliced thinly.  That's why I come here! All of the vegetables are fresh, the meats are nice and thinly sliced, and there are lots of choices for broth!  I highly recommend choosing your own \"dishes\" instead of choosing their dish bundles. I will recommend the bundles if you are an adventurous eater. The bundle can come with fish balls and other items you may have no interest in.   My favorite is the Korean Kim Chee broth. It's spicy but not overly spicy. I order beef, puff tofu, enoki mushroom, and spinach. YUM. Just thinking about it is making me drool. Tofu puffs are cubes of spongy tofu (not the white kind you're used to). They take a while to cook, so I normally plop them in and let them soak.   If you've never had hot pot before, not to worry. Just have fun with your food. Once you mark up what you want, go to the sauce booth. They have a recommended sauce and give your ingredients to make it. Just give it a try. While you're up there grab a slotted spoon to help you get the food you're cooking out of the pot.   The staff is nice and can speak Mandarin and English. I highly recommend going. If you're new to it, just let them know. They'll help you out!  If you don't feel like hot pot. That's ok! They have a normal menu you can order from too!"}
{"text":"Great place for a hot bowl of soup. The price was good and service was excellent. You get a lot of meat and vegetables with your order."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing for the hotpot because I haven't yet tried their cook to order foods, and may never do so given their hotpot is so delicious. I ordered the beef hotpot with mushroom broth. They bring out a little kettle of broth (with rehydrated shiitake mushrooms and a little clump on enokis). You then head up to the bar to pick out any additional seasonings for your broth (I chose garlic, chili oil, Mongolian sauce, scallions and cilantro) and noodles if you choose to add them (I chose the egg noodles, but they also had glass noodles and rice noodles). The raw plate came with thinly sliced beef, assorted veggies, fish balls, etc. you add  very thing to the kettle as quickly as you'd like to eat it and go nuts.  Short story, it was DELICIOUS and super satisfying. It's a small spot with only about 10 or so tables but I'm hooked and will definitely be a regular now."}
{"text":"Okay, here's the deal - if I was rating this place solely on the fun aspect of cooking your food in front of you, then this rating would be higher for sure. For me, I'm more interested in the food, variety, and price matching the quality. The food options are all pretty much the same thing with just with several different broths. It wasn't fine food, not delicious, but fine, maybe even good. My biggest disappointment was the quality vs. price - poorly matched in my opinion. Too expensive for me to stick my frozen dinner in to a pot of boiling broth. I probably wouldn't go back, but I wasn't upset that I tried it."}
{"text":"Lovely staff and good environment.  Besides the famous mini Hotpot here(a lot of people already recommend before). You could also order Chinese dishes and some traditional Chinese entrees. Lunch special M-F is a great deal. You will have two dishes(usually one meat and one vegetable) rice and tea egg cost $10.00 before tax and tip.  The dishes are more likely homemade styles instead of the too salty and oil Chinese food in other restaurants. The dumplings here are homemade style instead of frozen ones in some restaurant. Beef roll cake is a nice option as well.  I highly recommend that you try the Chinese Chives pie or Chinese leek box though you maybe need to wait a little longer time after ordering. But they are very yummy. Also availability about that depends on the leek.  Also I highly suggest you try the northeast pork bones, tofu sheets with hot peppers and hot spicy beef tendon!"}
{"text":"To a devout Pastafarian, noodle soups are a common and frequent form of worship. Vietnamese Pho, Thai Yen Ta Fo, Chinese Won Ton, and Italian minestrone all provide a path for enjoying \"his noodly appendage\". Since the Pastafarian liturgy is notoriously free form and elastic, Hot Pot provides the ultimate in free expression allowing a very personal holy potage. I will refer all Hot Pot newbies to Erin C.'s review for a primer. Don't be afraid. There are many paths to Hot Pot happiness!  Mini Hot Pot ROCKS! First time get one of the combi plates, maybe even your second time. If there are lots of people, get a couple of different combi plates and broths and share. There's tons of food and more at the buffet. That's where you'll find  multiple noodles to cook quickly (3min) in the broth. There's a recipe for a basic sauce on the wall near the buffet but feel free to experiment. Try rice noodles (thick and thin), egg noodles, ramen noodles, even a slice of sweet potato. Every time you come, it'll be different. This is improvisational Jazz-cooking, Chinese style!.  Feel the embrace of the FSM.  rAMEN!"}
