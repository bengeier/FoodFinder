{"text":"Seriously, good food.  The chef takes the time to prepare it just the way you want it.  It's the best place you've never heard of.  Good range of food, good pricing, friendly staff.  A welcome alternative to all the crap fast food in this area.  Come see for yourself.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"OK, I finally did it.  Yesterday, August 2, 2017 I went to Onion Steak Sub for the 3rd time and finally ordered something different than the Cheesesteak. Yesterday I ordered the Chicken Cheesesteak and I think it was even better than the beef Cheesesteak.  What a restaurant, what a menu, what an exceptional treat to have the best Cheesesteak sandwich shop close to my home.  Really folks, there should be a line out the door, Onion Steak Sub is that good!  Spoil yourself and go over to Onion Steak Sub and feast on real, high quality, exceptional sandwiches.  Love This Place."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese steak, and it was so good! There was plenty of  meat on the sandwich, it was cooked perfectly, and not overly seasoned. The bread was nice and soft too, which I like compared to bread that scratches the roof of your mouth when you take a bite. The staff was friendly, and the place was very clean. I will definitely go back, and hope they continue to get business and do well so they can stick around. We need good places to eat over here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both had the Philly cheese steak. Cooked to order, great flavor and reasonbly priced."}
{"text":"My second time there was today.  Ordered the burger special.  Meat tastes very fresh and cooked well.  Like that we can request certain toppings.  Fries, crinkle cut, yum.  Prices are fair. Close proximity to my work office.  Will recommend and be back soon."}
{"text":"Plain food & overpriced for what's it is. I ordered a chicken cheese sub, the most plain sandwich I've ever had. This place straight up disappointed me."}
{"text":"I've probably have been in a dozen times. Open 4 months. It the surprise that's been hiding. I'm from Philly and this Is The best of vegas. There opening a cupriottits across the street. But don't. It also makes jersey mikes taste....  Any way true it you'll never go anywhere else again.  Andy. PS all my friends now no where to go. Thanks Big John"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. The employees weren't very outgoing. Maybe because it was 117 outside. Little heavy on the seasoning on my ch whiz steak sandwich. The meat was great quality. With time this place could be good. You guys got this. I'll give it a month and try it again."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches stuffed with a lot of meat.. great staff and friendly management...  Very cute atmosphere.. prices are very good and sizes of Sandwich are amazing"}
{"text":"Food was overlooked on our Philly cheese steaks. Dry, bland and overpriced for what was served.  A bad knock off capriottis in our opinion.   We live around the corner and was looking forward to this place. We walked in and the placed had a bad smell to it. The menu was hand written and no pictures or previews of what to expect.   Next time we'll just head down the street for a much better sandwhich."}
{"text":"5 stars for the locally sourced bread, freshly cooked burger that made up one of the best Rueben sandwiches I've had. Bun was incredibly soft, saw the chef weighing out the fresh beef that had a nice bright red color to it before tossing it on the grill.   Well Done!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a friend and wanted to try a new place out. Needless to say it's now our weekly spot. This place has great service, awesome food and  a quick wait time for food. We ordered a regular Philly steak and a chicken bacon sub along with a side of beer battered onion rings. I'm hungry now thinking about it again. Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"I tried the \"Buffalo Chicken\" Sub ( + Onion, Tomato, & Pepper Jack).  Wow, this one has flavor! It is definitely not pretty, and you need a knife and fork to eat it, but it has a really solid \"kick\"  of spice. I would not recommend this for someone expecting a more mild sandwich. The chopped chicken is good, and I cut up some avocado at home to add to it.   This place has tasty options. Forget about Capriotti's, and show these guys some support!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Bacon Philly. Bread, meat and cheese were perfect!! Bacon was undercooked and suuuper greasy!! Would rather have it chopped in with the steak than laying on top.  Will just get a straight philly with no bacon next time"}
{"text":"Just moved in this area and decided to try this little gem one day. Now I can't stop going. To be honest, I've only tried a couple of the items off the menu because the cheesesteak is so good I just always order that.  And whatever you do MAKE SURE YOU TRY THE ONION SAUCE!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We stumbled upon this place tonight. My husband had the Philly cheesesteak with whiz and I had the avocado bacon burger.  Both were full of wonderful flavor. We also had the fries and onion rings...the rings were sooooo good!  Great local restaurant with incredible flavor.  Will definitely be returning and recommending to friends!"}
{"text":"I had the turkey with cranberry and it was nasty. It was dry as hell I thought I was gonna choke because how dry it was. Place smells funky also.  I live across the street and I'm glad to see Capriottis open up."}
{"text":"Have been here several times since I live and work close by.  My hubby was craving pastrami and we usually go to the Bagel Cafe since they are legit !!  The pastrami here was super lean and amazing.  The bread ... which can make or break a sandwich ... was spot on perfect.  We ordered french fries to go with the sandwich since I am a carb freak and the sauces they give you to go with the fries brought it to a new level !!  Amazing all the way around.  I highly recommend this little gem of a restaurant !!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! So happy this opened. There aren't a ton of great options in the neighborhood for something unique, delicious, reasonably priced, and just a gosh darn pleasant experience.  Finally, there's some competition for all these boring, corporate food joints. The service is phenomenal-even just getting take out, I feel like I'm treated to a 5-star experience! The food is exactly what you'd expect from a Philly Cheese Steak-centric sandwich place, but it's AWESOME. I'm not an expert, but I am a fan and this is the best Philly Cheese Steak I've had on the west coast. I haven't tried some of the other stuff on the menu but, based on my meals so far, I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything there. Try Onion, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is the worst steak sandwich I've ever had. The meat was dry and did not have any flavor what so ever. I went here for lunch on 1/4/17 with a co-Worker and we both were very disappointed with the food and service. I ordered the lunch special, which was a 6 inch steak sandwich with fries. I added mushrooms and mayo to my sandwich, when I received my sandwich I bit into it and noticed there wasn't any mayo on it. I returned to the counter and notified them that they forgot to put mayo on it, the cashier said \"oh I'm sorry we gave you the wrong sandwich, this is yours right here.\" As i was walking away the cook shouted, \"hey that's someone else's sandwich that's not yours.\" I turned around in disbelief and handed the sandwich back. I told him they forgot the mayo on my sandwich, He took my original sandwich opened it up and slapped a glob of mayo on both pieces. I will not be returning to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Wow the burger was juice and just right.  So glad this place is in the neighborhood and there open late."}
{"text":"I would call before going to the Onion steak sub shop. They have a very limited amount of subs on their menu! They have no cold cuts/submarine sandwiches in which was very disappointing! I guess they have to compete with with their competitor that's across the street."}
{"text":"Holy cow and OMG this place is good.  The Philly chz steak with the wiz. Bomb!!!  I'm in trouble with this place down the street."}
{"text":"Went in on their first day. It was a bit hectic, but owner is very enthusiastic and wanting to please. I had a Nigerian sub and it was packed with freshly sliced meat and whatever else I wanted on it. I had a hard time finishing it, which is unusual. I can guarantee you I will not be setting foot in Subway again now that this is in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Great food, next time I won't do a 10 inch, tons of food. I got a green pepper chicken and my hubby got a mushroom cheese steak and we split both. I liked the chicken better. Very friendly and they offer military discount."}
{"text":"We should have going to Subway their sandwiches are better. The vegetarian sandwich is horrible. The Cheesesteak didn't have much flavor I paid extra for the green peppers that were chunks instead of sliced to match the sliced onions and the green peppers were not fully cooked. I would not be going back there."}
{"text":"What a great find!!  We stopped to give the Onion Steak Sub a try and it turned out to be great!! Tony behind the counter was great, since it was our first time there, it took a few minutes to figure out what to try.  When we were finally ready, Tony took care of our orders and while waiting, we enjoyed the eclectic array of wall hangings. The food was delivered to us within minutes and what a treat, each of the orders was great! The double burger is a man-versus-food event, the Pastrami and Swiss on the roll was a welcome treat, and their salads were fresh and delicious.   Located to the west of the 215 just off Cheyenne, it is very easy to get to, parking is easy and the service and food are fantastic!  I'll be coming back to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Yeah so forget about Subway or Jimmy Johns.  Don't forget about Capriottis or Port of Subs, they are still good. But they have some serious competition in the sandwich universe   The Rueben is amazing.   The Italian (the actual name of the sandwich is escaping me) is amazing   Do yourself a favor. Try. This. Place."}
{"text":"The Italian sub and the cheese steak are both good. The meat in the cheese steak was on point, well seasoned and grilled up well. The onion rings are also pretty good. Decor is kind of weird but charming. It's like they all pitched in some furniture from their houses to put a restaurant together. I'm pretty sure the drinks are set up on a dresser. Whatever, it's actually quite a good cheese steak! And much closer than Pops! There are some other Philly cheese steaks around this side of town, but none are quite as good.   They've only been open for a couple of days, so try them!"}
{"text":"Pros: fast, hot, nice workers, clean area.  Cons: both my meals were very bland. Had the chicken philly fries and bacon cheese steak sandwich. I would not say it was a bad meal but I have no plans of returning."}
{"text":"Juicy burger , fresh meat and toppings fries with ketchup is good onion rings are big , I will be returning for sure. There isn't many good food spots here in this part of town onion steak is good for this area"}
{"text":"I stopped in and got a mushroom burger with grilled onions and even though they forgot the mushrooms, it was really good. Juicy, flavorful and the bun was incredibly soft."}
{"text":"Good sandwhes and variety! Definitely beats the same old national chains we are used to. Next time you are in the mood for a sandwich check it out."}
{"text":"the only good thing about this place is that there is a tropical smoothie next door. Workers messing up orders and it' being over priced does not help this business. they charge 21$ for their biggest sub and it doesn't even come with fries . they also dont have a 12' in. option you either go to 10' or jump all the way up to 20' there is no in between ."}
{"text":"It's really too bad this place is so far away from me. I would be here all the time otherwise.   I ordered the Green pepper & mushroom philly steak with whiz cheese (upon excellent recommendation by the friendly cashier - sorry I didn't catch her name for a shout out) and I really liked the taste of everything together. They don't skimp on their meat portion. Every bite had a good amount. Don't forget their beer battered onion rings! I kick myself for not getting a large size but it was delish! I don't know what they put in their batter but man, it was addicting and flavorful.   It was a nice little place where you can grab a quick bite to eat and plenty of tables/chair to hang out with some friends. The customer service was excellent. Cashier was very helpful, friendly and nice. My order came out really fast.   Overall, great experience. Definitely recommended!  A+++++++"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally tried this restaurant. The Philly cheesesteak is great, but my favorite menu item is the chicken cheese fries. They are amazing. The service is fast and efficient as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic subs and fries! Try the Al Capone and the Italian. Also the Onion Rings are amazing!"}
{"text":"So I really wanted to love this place, I'd heard rave reviews from friends and it's not a chain so it has to be good, right? First time I tried it, I got a green pepper, mushroom cheesesteak with American cheese (I wish they had white American but oh well). So I get home and unwrap the sandwich and the cheese on my sandwich isn't fully melted, total bummer since the cheesy goodness makes a cheesesteak.   I tried it again the other night and got a green pepper, mushroom cheesesteak with whiz and provolone and then got a pastrami sandwich with mustard, onion, lettuce. I got home and opened the sandwiches and noticed there wasn't any whiz on the cheesesteak but saw a little yellow on the bread so figured maybe they put a tiny bit. Nope, that was mustard. They mixed up the sandwiches. So I had a cheesesteak with provolone and mustard and a pastrami sandwich with onion and lettuce, no whiz at all. For the record, the mustard cheesesteak was not accidentally delicious.   I really wanted to like this place better than Capriotti's but both times my sandwiches haven't been worth it. Two stars are for the friendly staff and the general quality of sandwiches."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place! Food was so good! Me and my husband shared the Philly cheesesteak w/cheese whiz and a large basket of fries. The person who took our order was very nice. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Edit: Came back for the cheesesteaks. Tried the traditional and the chicken. Meat was good, bread was good, could use a little more whiz. Tried the Nigerian, little strange that it was completely dry, meat and cheese, no sauce or anything. Seems like the kitchen is still figuring things out. Also tried to order a burger but they didn't have ingredients do make it.  Being West Coasters we compare all cheesesteaks to Pops in town. Was almost as good and it's closer so we'll be back to give them another try.   Haven't tried the cheesesteaks yet because we weren't hungry when we stopped by for a menu but we did get some cheese fries. They have whiz! And they fresh slice the steak! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place. I got a cheese steak with cheese wiz. Very good. I was disappointed that they did not have the waffle fries. Onion rings were superb! Love the philly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood sandwich shop. Quality meats and handmade onion rings. I love that I can call on my way and have a short wait for fresh, warm food. The staff is always super friendly and willing the give helpful suggestions to the meal. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Very tasty Philly with east coast cheddar wiz cheese. The  Onion sauce on the side gives it a little kick too! I love the mix of regular and waffle fries. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We love it here. We always say this place needs to be way busier. Right across the street from Capriottis and we'd pick here a thousand times over them! Zero complaints.  Got the buffalo chicken and a pastrami 10\" and my husband and I split half and half so we get to try more of their menu.  Just praying this place stays in business"}
{"text":"Never been here before; stopped in to grab a quock snack of fries. It smelled so good I couldn't resist ordering a cheesesteak, burger and mixed basket of sides. Cheesesteak is legit (yes, they even have Wiz) and love that they offer a mixed basket of onion rings, waffle fries and regular fries. Staff is friendly and attentive.  Everything is made to order and they encourage you to request it however you like it."}
{"text":"We think the sandwiches are huge, a 10\" is big enough for 2 of us.  We love the Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  We tried the Buffalo chicken but it was a little too spicy for us. The fries are good and hot. The service is very fast.  It's close to our home so it's pretty convenient when I don't feel like cooking, this is a good alternative. We look forward to trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I got take out and it was our 1st time. We ordered 2 philly cheese steaks. I loved that you can customize what you want! We both got grilled onions. I got bacon on mine and yummie addition. The sandwhich was very tasty.   We got one side of fries and one side of onion rings. Loved the fries my husband enjoyed the onion rings I thought they couldve been a bit more crunchy.   Can we talk about their special sauces?! Those were awesome. One was sweet with like an Asian twist and the other had a kick not spicy though. I wish we would've got more!! But now that we know I will ask for more!   The place is small there was maybe 5 people that came in after us. Becomes small quick. They do have high chairs! Service was great. The lady taking our irder was helpful and super friendly! We will return for sure.  So we returned but one tiny problem how will I ever decide between a burger or the philly cheese steak. That burger was seriously ONE OF THE BEST. Grilled onions gave it an extra great taste. My husband tried the chicken philly cheese with cheese wiz umm deliash. I highly recommend you go with someone who will share so you can get a cheeseburger and a philly cheese and eat both!!"}
{"text":"Cheese steak and beer battered onion rings were amazing. I highly recommend to give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was very good it lived up to reviews I received. The service was not as good they were busy but messing up my order and the slow service was frustrating since I drove from Henderson to give them a try. Maybe it was a bad day. I will give them another try another day."}
{"text":"Double cheese burger and beer battered onion rings were out of this world delicious. This is the first time that I've had to eat my burger with a fork and knife. The staff was awesome. They were so genuinely nice and happy to be there.  I highly recommend this restaurant!  You can get a single burger fries and soda for just $7.99"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time today. WOW! Very good lunch. We both had a philly. One chicken and the other beef. Great seasoning. Good soft and fresh bread. Just the right amount of cheese. We are so happy to find a neighborhood favorite. Plus the staff was very attentive and appreciative. A definite do again. We highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with fries and it was so good and not overly priced! The philly was flavorful and everything I wanted in it was put in it (mushrooms, peppers, lettuce, tomato, etc). I work right next door at State Farm so it's super convenient for me as well. Called in my order for pick up and my food was ready within 10-15. I mean, it's not fine dining so I don't have super high expectations as long as the food and service is good then I have no complaints.   For now I'm trying to clean eat but when I do squeeze in my little cheat meals here and there I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We happened to be on this side of town so we thought we'd Yelp search the area for a good place to grab a quick lunch and found this place. It was worth the drive. Everything is super fresh and flavorful. Word of advice though, don't come in here expecting to order a specific type of cheesesteak (that you're used to or \"how it's supposed to be served\"). This place has its own take on it and it's base is just close enough to traditional to make it enjoyable but you can't just get a cookie-cutter sandwich here. If you keep that in mind you'll be good. The service needs a little improvement as it is a little out of sync with the cheerful, home-like vibe and exceptional cooking. If they get that down this place could be around for the long haul."}
{"text":"We lived around the corner and we're excited to try this place. It's finally open. I had the plain old original cheese steak. Had to the first time. It was really good. Good bun. Good meat. The onion rings are amazing. Looking forward to trying other stuff. Every kind of cheese steak your can think of but other subs as well. Maybe pastrami next time."}
{"text":"Omg they had me cheese fries! Great flavors and they keep it simple. No over the top shenanigans to disguise lack flavor like most new food place we see lately. Legit burger and subs shop. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I've been to Onion Steak Sub five times it's now our new favorite place.  While their Philly steak and tuna subs are amazing, it's their chicken fingers that won us over.  I don't typically care for chicken fingers though Onion's fingers are yummy - not too breaded and the  perfect consistency. The BBQ sauce is also yummy.  And the chicken fingers taste great the cold the next day.  My only complaint is that they are closed on Sundays and we are totally craving the chicken fingers!"}
{"text":"I ordered the 10 inch Cheesesteak and Fries. It's huge! And tastes great! The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because the meat was Fatty, Gristly and a bit tough and chewy."}
{"text":"Tried the turkey sub. Soo much meat! I bought a 10in and ate half one day and the other half another. Great quality turkey. I will be trying the Ruben next."}
{"text":"I ordered a mushroom cheesesteak with onions and whiz. The sandwich was really good. I had fries with it. They were a little soggy but I took my order to go and they were covered with foil. I think if I had eaten there they would have been just fine. They seem just a bit disorganized with their ordering system. There were two orders ahead of me and after they both received theirs the kid who took my order told the cook he needed one more. That made my order take longer than it should have hence the four stars. I will definitely try them again and I believe they will find their groove. I have high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Top notch Philly cheese steak sanwhich. I was about go into tropical smoothie but the pictures on the window caught my eyes. Great decision,  I will definitely be back great sandwich,  service and price."}
{"text":"Recently moved around the corner and was hoping to find a good local spot to eat regularly. I have been here a few times now and the service isn't very friendly. Alot of love and friendly pictures hanging up but they don't align with the service I've received. The food is decent but the service really rubbed us the wrong way. The female at the front is friendly but the other kid could learn a little about good service. With cappriotis moving across the street they should do more to keep customer's rather than push them away. Good genuine service goes along way."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff.  Retraunt was very clean. We had a burger, chicken Philly and fries and everything tasted great."}
{"text":"I've tried this place for the 1st time this  Evening. I will have to say I agree with everyone the staff there is super friendly and makes you feel welcomed. Now for the most important part the food, which was absolutely the best steak and cheese sandwich I've had in Las Vegas. You can tell this steak is freshly shaved every day. The steak and cheese sandwich had great flavor and was cooked to perfection. I also ordered on your rings which I watched them hand batter them in front of me,  The any rings were also huge probly 6 to 8\" around. They have definitely gained a customer for life."}
{"text":"Onion is my new favorite Philly spot! The guy at the counter was so nice. My first time going and he explained to me the menu. The restaurant is small and cozy but very clean and lots of pictures on the walls to keep you entertained.   What I ordered:  10in Philly cheese steak with grilled onions and cheese wiz  5/5 stars  The meat was grilled well, juicy and full of flavor. The grilled onions were go damn good! And I usually get American or provolone cheese but got cheese wiz for the first time...I'm officially hooked!   Onion rings: 4/5  The small order came with 4 HUGE rings. They were yummy but the batter kinda was just so so. They do have an onion ring sauce that was a great compliment to the onion rings."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood! We are so happy to have another restaurant choice right around the corner from us. I had the tuna sub and it was super yummy. My boyfriend had the Philly cheesesteak and said it was the best he has had here in Vegas. We look forward to try all the other suns they offer."}
{"text":"Place is AMAZING if you like a good steak sub!! I suggest the 20 inch, it's even better the next day!! I plan on visiting weekly. The guys behind the counter are very friendly. Top notch quality Angus rib eye steak on very nice sub roll with many options available to personalize your masterpiece!!"}
{"text":"Great local place everything is so fresh and so many options of food haven't had any bad food keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Philly so I was VERY skeptical. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! They're slicing quality ribeye steak on site, which equals fresh, not frozen QUALITY meat. Good stuff. Authentic feel and taste. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Very good!  Fresh ingredients!  Friendly staff!  I had the Philly cheesesteak and onion rings.  Can't wait to go back to try some other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Onion Steak Sub Located Here In Las Vegas NV  Is Sooooo GOOD!!  Oh MY Gosh!! The Sandwiches Here Are AWESOME!! Seriously Good Eats!! I'm Talking  Yummmmmmm O' Rama!!!  FANTASTIC SERVICE from Tony and The COOK!!  I Had Onion Steak Sub Bookmarked On My Yelp For The Longest Time. I'm So HAPPY We Finally Gave This Shop A Try.  We all ordered something different from the cheesesteak sandwich to the cheeseburger and let's not forget my grilled chicken sandwich.  My grilled chicken sandwich was covered in melted cheese and hugged that grilled chicken perfectly, ya know the way a cheese lover would want it to. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. Seasoning was delicious and not at all salty. Thank goodness!   Onion Rings and French Fries Were Good Too!  The cook prepares your food right there in the open space behind the counter. Very nice!  ALL of our food was cooked to perfection.  I'm already looking forward to my next delicious sandwich from Onion Steak Sub!  Seriously Consider This Place For Your Next Hot Or Cold Sandwich.  Highly Recommend!!  :)"}
{"text":"Was happy to see a sub shop open so close to my house. Went in and wife had the Philly cheese steak wit cheese wiz. Was good, right amount of meat to cheese. I had the steak fries, which is the guts of a cheese steak put over crinkle cut fries since I can't have bread. Was very good. Not greasy. Service was ok, it was lunch time so the wait was long, a little too long in my opinion. I placed the order, then went next door for smoothies then still waited at least 10 mins so overall was about 25 mins for 2 sandwiches and a steak fry. Food was good, will go back. Hoping they get better at timing"}
{"text":"Capriotis is the best thing that happened to Onion.   Onion beefed up their game and menu is more focused AND its pretty darn good now.   I got the Reuben sub and it was really good, bought a cheese steak for my wife and she gave it a thumbs up from last time.  We had the Steak Fries as well and they were great.  Steak is good quality and they don't short you on portions.  Owner is still cooking in the back which I have to respect and staff is knowledgeable now.  AND they have burgers!  Noone up here does that except Timbers...smart play.   They still have the cheesy decor but if the food is good who cares.  Ill go back for sure because I am a Capriotis fan BUT each place has different menus.  Good job Onion. I was rooting for you when changes happened and you adapted very well."}
{"text":"I would not recommend getting a burger here.  I felt the $6.00 burger is better at Carls jr!  On my lunch break I order a cheese burger.. More like a over done,  bland hockey puk for a patty!  Wrapped it up and gave it to my dog when I got home. I understand if you feel the need to \"\"throughly\" cook the patty to play it safe.. But,  you killed this one flavor,  juice and all and taste like a poor grade of beef also.. So if you want an over done,  tasteless,  rubbery burger this is your spot!  Complete waste of money and a disappointment when you only have a short break to eat!  I will say this tho the waffle fries look pretty bomb and cheese steak sandwich looked decent also. I saw a customer eating that while waiting for leather boot,  dried out cheese burger!"}
{"text":"im a deli sandwhich guy and this place piles on the meat..i havent tried Woods Subs but this is way better than any other spot just cuz of the amount of meat..i had 10 in italian but wuda been good with a 6..i will be back to try the burger and cheese steak..best cheese steaks are Pops and Those Guys Pies so we will see...hope this spot dont close"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place yesterday - it's pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good. Had a 10inch chicken philly and added onions. The price is right and the sandwich was really good. Lots of meat. I wasn't even able to finish it and I can eat a giant size at Jersey mikes in one sitting. I'll definitely be coming here often."}
{"text":"We had mushroom steak sandwich and it was delicious. The Italian sub was excellent. Good French fries with big portion. I will stop here again soon."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Like one you would order at a sit down place. Good phillys. Good fries. Good dipping sauces.  We will be coming here often. It's very affordable and a super cute place."}
{"text":"You know what, every time I've had their chicken or philly cheese steak, it's been consistently great, so I do I even have a choice other than giving them 5 stars? I think not.  Also, the faces behind the counter are also very pleasant. Not like they're upset you showed up, which unfortunately you come across once in a while.  The end."}
{"text":"Been here once before, food was amazing. Not sure if owners change or what but a completely different experience this time and i won't be back. Changed the menus specials which didn't seem to make everyone very happy as every single person that came in after me asked for them. I called ahead so i wouldn't have to wait, told me no problem be ready in 10 min. I showed up waited another 20 min for my food. Very unorganized as i watched my fries & onion rings get cold while waiting for my burger and Philly Cheesesteaks to be made then the bag sat their another 10 min until they realized i had ordered 2 cheesesteaks . Which then they had to make while all the rest of my food got colder and colder.  Then finally gave me my food but left out my onion rings, which then i had to ask them for my onion rings and even point out where they had put them. By the time i made it home food was cold & disgusting. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The Capone sub is on point.  Def stop in and try it out.  I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I went to the Onion Steak and Sub for lunch. It is by my house. I love going to the mom and pop places because this is their life. I had the green pepper cheese whiz steak. It was delicious. Reasonable prices also. The only complaint that I have is for a place named Onion there were hardly any in my sandwich."}
{"text":"Small servings, and there was barely any meat in our sandwich. Plus the meat they used for chicken wasn't right, and it had a lot of fat in the meat"}
{"text":"Had the Philly w mushrooms, The cheese was amazing that they use. Not a bad place to get a quick bite . Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome. The cook knows me and acknowledges me every time I come in. Their food is comfort food and always hits the spot. I've never been disappointed with their food. More people need to know about this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Cheese steak is really good. Onion rings are my favorite. Takes a little long but the wait is worth it!"}
