{"text":"Keep up the good work guys me and my wife stop here one summer day for lunch and was it good food and nice people at the counter"}
{"text":"The service is a little gruff here, at least in my experience, but the pizza is delicious--and cheap!  Eight bucks and some change for a large cheese pizza with a perfect cheese-to-sauce ratio and a nice, thin crust.  And cheese cuts are one buck!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Just ordered a pizza and the middle was soggy. Mushrooms and green peppers were not very warm, pepperoni was not crispy and the edges of the roni peeled off."}
{"text":"I stopped in on my way home around 9:30pm and got two slices of pepperoni pizza, and it was delicious.  This is what a pizza place should be-- no gimmicks, no complications, just tasty, perfectly greasy, amazing, hot pizza.  YUM.  Crust is great, cheese is great, they don't use that sweet tomato sauce that I hate, and they don't skimp on the pepperoni.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great stuff. In the heart of little italy in Bloomfield. I stop here for a Sicilian slice and/or a ny style slice. He makes a nice pie here. Also find them at the annual italian fest. Lots of cheese you won't be disappointed. Fast and simple. Keep up the nice work."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza in pittsburgh! The dough has the perfect amount of fermentation and rises great. They obviously know what they are doing and I have been a happy customer for over five years. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"You want pizza? You'll getta pizza. It's good. Definitely my go-to for price and quality, but, despite being my standard, it doesn't have that extra je ne sais quoi that would make a five star slice. By the slice pizzas often sit for awhile, and though a slice is only $1.30, they're only about 30% of a slice wide, so I'd recommend going in for a whole pie."}
{"text":"Okay, first thing to note is this is NOT Carusotti's, but a new restaurant occupying the same  space.  The new place is family owned and operated.  This is authentic (as authentic as the Sicilian patriarch in the kitchen barking instructions in Italian) Chicago pizza.  Haven't tried the wings yet, so I really can't comment.  They got off to a little bit of a rough start, we went during their first week and the wait was a little too long.  Last time in, about a week ago, things are running much more smoothly.  The atmosphere is a little stark, but comfortable, and the people are great.  Some real \"personalities\" there!  Get the pizza, and get sausage on it.  The pizza is easily the best option on the menu.  The sausage is obviously home made and really, really good."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, inexpensive and tasty pizza. We only ordered from this resturant once and we were satisfied with the quality and delivery."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place surrounding me. The main reason is their cheese and sauce, it's excellent! My delivery order is always right on their estimated time and the food is hot every time."}
{"text":"I had a small pepperoni pizza. I wasn't feeling the crust at all, it reminded me of store bought pizzas. My pepperoni had curled up into small bowls that were filled with grease;not appetizing. I've had worse pizza but I've definitely had better."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza is great and I love the steak hoggies with extra steak Mmm ....  The food does not cost the earth. Pizza and the rest of the food is the Best you will find in this area. Other places cost more but there not as good . The staff are always on the ball !"}
{"text":"Waited almost 2 hours to have wrong pizza delivered. Not sure what went wrong, but won't be ordering from these guys again."}
{"text":"Super cheap prices and ready quickly.  I got the extra large cheese and demolished about two-thirds of it.  No fancy \"gourmet\" pizzas on the menu.  You just tell them what you want, and they make it.  Simple + tasty + affordable = repeat customer."}
{"text":"I ordered here after the many good reviews but was quite disappointed. The cheap prices are about the only good thing I can say about this place. The pizza wasn't terrible but it certainly wasn't good in my opinion. Zero flavor and the mushrooms were canned. I've had much better at other Bloomfield joints. Would not order again."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing delivery experience. Let's recap the order:  1 - Pizza: Doughy, and the crust to cheese ratio was far too high. The least offensive part of a terrible meal  2: Side Salad: Cheese to lettuce ratio was approximately 50:50 and the veggies were barely chopped. Ain't nothing like trying to bite into an entire half tomato!  3: Hot sausage sub: Bread was soggy to the point of all contents falling out of the sandwich upon first bite.  Gross.    4: Diet coke: Never arrived with my order!   Will not be coming back.  Thank you for a terrible Friday night meal"}
{"text":"Pizza Italia is one of the best pizza joints around. Their sauce is the best part, but you can tell the ingredients are fresh. A real solid pie."}
{"text":"Pizza I has always been a staple in our household. When you walk in, you're greeted as if you're family. The pizza is decently priced and they always have something cold to drink. My absolute favorite is extra cheese-pepperoni-welldone."}
{"text":"I came across this place and decided to give it a try after scrolling through the long list of pizza joints.  A quick call was made to place my order and it was on!  Be careful you don't miss it as it's sandwiched between other businesses which is typical of this area.  GPS took me to the rear of the building as it sometimes does but no biggie. It's on the same side as Del's but up a piece.   When I walked up to the entrance, that smell of yummy pizza sauce and cheese just smacked me in the face.  The lady working the counter was extremely polite while I was there and she rushed to make sure my pizza was boxed asap. Hell, she even smiled!  When I arrived home and opened the box, I knew I had made a good choice.  A pizza topped with a good dose of pepperoni and mushrooms was my poison for the evening.   We enjoyed every bite. The sauce wasn't overly sweet but seasoned just right and they use canned mushrooms which is what I actually prefer most of the time.    My fellow Yelpers steered me right again! I have no complaints...this pizza is just plain good!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a mushroom and pepperoni pizza.  It was very good with just enough cheese and sauce.  The sweet Chile wings with the dry Cajun rub were also really good.  They were decent sized wings and not the tiny one biters you can get sometimes.  The price was really good for the amount of food we got.  I won't hesitate to order from them again."}
{"text":"I think Pizza Italia is a vastly underrated pizza shop in Pittsburgh.  I usually get a large half with pep & sausage and the other half with pep & mushroom.  The toppings are top notch especially the sausage.  Plus, the price is very reasonable.  It's in my top 3 pizza places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I would have given pizza Italia a better review but because of the circumstances I've recently encountered with them my rating has declined. I've been ordering from there for a while and can't believe the responses I received. We ordered 2 pizzas at 4:30 and were told 45 min for delivery. It took double that time for the pizza to arrive after I called and asked why it wasn't here I was told it will get here when it gets here due to traffic. I understand there's instances when there's traffic or what not but the way the pizza arrived was cold and with tough cheese. I have 3 children so I then needed to take them to dinner when I'd already paid for dinner. I called right after the pizza was delivered and told them I wanted a refund and they could come get the pizza but they said no , the manager wasn't there and there wasn't a reason to come back and get the pizza to call and talk to the manager tomorrow. So after getting off the phone I'm very displeased because I'm now being asked to return these pizzas which have been in the garbage and return them to get my money back. I told them to come get the pizza last night , I'm a busy mother and I'm working. I don't have the time. Also when telling the manager I'm probably not ordering from there anymore he told me he would understand. Very horrible business . I will not order from here ever again ."}
{"text":"Basic pizza. Pretty solid, not too expensive and open till 11:00 on weeknights. Really not much to complain about."}
{"text":"Well it only just opened this week and from what my fabulous friend who picked up a yummy pizza for us last night stated, \" I am happy I came in when I did because if I would have waited 5 more mins, it would have been a very long wait as that place was packed! Not a single table was open when I walked out with our food\"  Not bad for the first week huh?  We had a mushroom, ham, pepperoni, cheese pizza that was cooked to perfection. The crust was thin but not cracker thin like some places. There were tons of mushrooms, ham, and pepperoni sprinkled all over the pizza. The cheese was gooey and yummy (is gooey a word?) As a matter of fact, I had either a piece of mushroom, ham, or pepperoni in every bite. We pretty much finished off the large pizza, which was cut into squares and not slices (which I am a fan of by the way). Very good pizza if I do say so myself.   Now the wings we had, well they were ok, but I will give them another try at later date. I mean they weren't bad, but I have had much better.   They do offer deep dish however they are still waiting for their pans to come in in order to make that dish. (Remember they only just opened this week) They do not offer delivery just yet, but seeing as its lets than 2 mins away I would need to be smacked if I asked them to deliver. I can be lazy if I want to dang it!   So give them a try if you are ever on this side of town. You just may be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for walking distance pizza (even though I love Spak Bros, my wallet favors Pizza Italia). It's cheap and it's quality. The lady who works there is always real friendly. I could eat this every week and not get sick of it. Just a good straight forward mom and pop pizza pie. You know what I'm saying. 9 bucks and some change for a nice large for a night you don't feel like cooking. They don't do specials, if you ask, they'll say their normal prices are specials. Just like Shur Save."}
{"text":"I have never heard of Pizza Italia last week, let alone eaten a thing from them.  Shame, shame on me for not doing so earlier.    I trusted my friend when I was informed that not only was the pizza good, but I'd be wanting more.  There was no lie in that statement whatsoever.  We got a medium and large pizza with pepperoni.  Unlike typical places where you get the big slices of pepperoni thrown on top without a care, here you get the smaller, more true pepperoni that is strategically placed to maximize your chance of getting pepperoni in every bite.  What's also good about this pepperoni is that it curls up perfectly to create that awesome little bowl for grease to collect.  You know, that grease that you have to just dip your crust in.  Yes, I did rip my crust off before I got to it just so I could enjoy my fattening myself.  No judging allowed!  However, I cannot give you five stars PI (I like that, pi, pizza pi, such a connection).  You do not deliver."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. I've eaten it since I was a kid. They recently sold the place and the new owner is doing the recipe justice. Now they accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Six words can succinctly sum this place up: Good neighborhood pizza on the cheap!  The interior is a bit rough-looking and the service is sort of endearingly yinzer. Nothing wrong with that, considering it IS a neighborhood dive. Their pizza is definitely a notch above the rest and their prices are very reasonable. Unfortunately, they don't do too many specials and their menu is pretty run-of-the-mill. It's definitely a traditional New York-style pizza kind of place (in other words, no crazy/awesome combinations or vegan options - sorry).  In the end, you really can't go wrong with Pizza Italia. Just head down the street and pick up the new Woody Allen from Dreaming Ant and you're set for the night!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple years but something just get better with time . Ordered 2 extra large pizzas and 20 minutes later they were ready and it's the best pizza in the burgh by far ."}
{"text":"So it was freezing in Pittsburgh yesterday. I made the trek over to Bloomfield for a dog walking gig and had planned on stopping at that new PB&J place. They are sadly closed on Mondays, but I was starving. I have had Pizza Italia bookmarked for a while so I decided to stop in.  The puppy I walk has tried to break in here multiple times on walks, and I know why. It smells delicious.  This is a great little Mom and Pop to go shop. I ordered two slices of cheese pizza ($2.60). They were very average sized but a good price. The crust is on the thicker side, and they use a sweet sauce with very mild seasoning. And unlike most places, Pizza Italia puts enough cheese on the pizza that you can actually taste it. This is a solid slice of cheese. Nothing special but good.  The thing that sets them over the top is the owners.  Everyone was chatty and friendly and just lovely.  Support this Mom and Pop shop over the chains!    This place is strictly takeout, and there is no seating, FYI.  Credit card minimum of $5"}
{"text":"Do not get the Buffalo Chicken Pizza!!!  Worst pizza I've had in years.  Delivery was 30 mins late and pizza was cold upon delivery.  I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"So far, my second favorite Pittsburgh pizza.  Just like my other favorite, I will keep this simple.   Here are the reasons why I think Pizza Italia is pretty awesome and why I think most people would enjoy it: 1) Your basic pizza shop, nothing crazy (low key, easy to get in and out, and not hard to place an order) 2) CHEAP, you get a lot of food at a great price 3) They are friendly  4) The sauce and crust were perfect 5) You can tell they know how to make a pizza (and are not just trying to for the sake of having a pizza shop--- sadly there are too many of these around)  If you have not tried this magnificent find in Bloomfield, I highly suggest giving it a whirl.  I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Another great day at the Bloomfield pool led me to another awesome eatery in Bloomfield. I seen a nice bunch walking out with yummy fresh pizza slices & noticed  the sign stating $1.50 pepperoni slices. Say no more! :)  our pizza was yummy & we tried the pepperoni roll for $2.75. I seriously expected one of those little pepperoni house rolls from other shops (which are great btw) but nope! it was literally 10x bigger than expected. We split it & could've eaten 3 more.   I don't want to hype it up though, because they weren't extremely generous on the pepperoni in the roll. no spot was empty, but I just prefer like 3 layers of it, haha. But all in all it was good pizza & food at an extremely cheap price with friendly workers. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've been going to chipotle all this time when I could be having pizza Italia.  Sauce and cheese are amazing. The crust is delicious. The pepperoni curls just right along the edges.   I'll write more next time I order more toppings."}
{"text":"If i was rating the sandwiches and whole pizzas, it would definitely be five stars all the way.   However their single slices are horrible.  I thought they would heat them up after the slices sit in the heater area.  I asked for extra sauce, thinking that the slices will be heated.  I was given a slice of pizza with cold sauce."}
{"text":"Not the same pizza or dressing since the new owner took over. Pizza slices sitting out are better at convenience stores than here and the dressings are the cheap kind now. The ranch dressing used to be good and now it's just gross."}
{"text":"Sucks dick. We ordered at 830 pm. Didn't deliver by 1030pm then they cancelled our delivery and they were \"sorry\". I bet."}
{"text":"This pizza is the worm's perm. I would risk my health and well being by eating their pep pizza everyday if I could. This one dude I know, Bill, crushes these pies like Michael Irvin crushes rock. I might start wearing their pizzas as underwear so my body smells like Italian heaven all day long. Stremphs to the neffs for real."}
{"text":"OMG , I Found one of the VERY BEST Hot Sausage WITH CHEESE sandwiches that I have EVER tasted. Pizza Italia is a wonderful small business ( and I LOVE Small Buz ! ) You should check with your cardiologist before ordering these fine delicacies. This is a great balance of fine Italian hot sausage with onions and souses.  They even speak Italian to each other !  Pizza-hut can burn in hell ! This is how it should be done !!! Also , The Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Is 1 1/2 an option? This place was really disappointing, the fact that it had four stars made me wonder if people in Pittsburgh know what's good pizza and the fact that is in Little Italy leaves me puzzled. I expected more from Pittsburgh's Little Italy and what many reviews claimed to be the best pizza in Pittsburgh. This isn't it, we ordered a variety of items including pizza, wings, a salad, fries, and a sub. The highlight would have to be the two liter of coke we ordered. Overall the food was edible and below average; for good pizza I expect a thin crust with a really delicious sauce. This crust was thicker and the sauce was nothing special; the rest of the food we found to be equally disappointing. I really hope for the sake of the people of Pittsburgh that there is a better pizza option that we over looked."}
{"text":"Workers were really nice and the pizza was great! Would definitely order from again!"}
{"text":"Got a medium peperoni pizza on sunday... it was more like a large.. I turned my brother in law onto this place  and he Loved The Pizza!!  I uaed to eat here almost every other day when i worked at raduoshack on baum blvd back in the day.. Glad they take credit cards now AND Deliver.... Heard it was under.new management..  All i know is The  Pizza is Great.. Prices Are Great.. and the staff was More that Friendly and personable Unlike Downtown pizza shops   Ill Definity be getting alot more pies here.. and so will you once you try them..."}
{"text":"Mmmmm delicious pizza at a great price.  I got a pie last time I was in town will defiantly be back! Service was straight forward, just order what you want and come back in 10-15 minutes for the goodness.  I ordered a medium (14\") pie 1\2 pepperoni 1\2 mushroom for $9.10 ($7.50 + $1.60). Took a quick 10 minute walk and our pie was ready for us to grab a seat outside and enjoy.  Perfect location to grab a bite to eat and watch the world go around.  Ingredients were very fresh, the cheese was delicious and the crust was nice and crisp.   They offer pies, hoagies and calzones... sticking to what they are good at.  I will definitely be back to enjoy another slice."}
{"text":"Thanks for making me wait 45 minutes inside the shop because the workers were too busy screaming at each other to realize my pizza had been done the whole time."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Bloomfield. Prompt delivery. Moved out of Bloomfield to Highland Park and continue to order from here. They deliver to HP as well."}
{"text":"Very average pizza. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza and it arrived on time and warm. The crust and sauce were lacking in flavor and the cheese and pepperoni where average at best. It was about two dollars cheapper than most other pizza shops so I actually think it's a viable option oif you want a cheaper pizza."}
{"text":"I ordered this pizza through delivery and I was excited because I generally really like a NY style, thin crust pizza. We got three large pizzas, one with pepperoni, one mushroom and spinach, and one cheese. The main issue I had with Pizza Italia was the lack of salt. Everything else was good but it really needed more salt in the crust and sauce. Both tasted bland. With the small addition, I think this pizza could be really good!"}
{"text":"Looks like it could be good, but had to put it in oven to finish cooking. Cheese not even melted, crust a pale white. That's the biggest disappointment. Called, said he \"didn't get to look at pizza before sending it out, he'll try harder next time.\" Recommend you put a note to please thoroughly cook through. Tuesday at 8 pm- no good excuse to rush a pie out. Boo."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my girlfriend and another dining companion for dinner.  We decided to come here after after reading all of the good Yelp reviews.  It is a pretty easy place to find as it is right on Liberty but I was a bit disappointed whenever I walked inside.  You see we were looking at eating it there and they have no tables.  Thankfully it was nice outside and they did have a couple of seats in front although that left us subjected to the cigarette smoke of the workers and a crazy group of loud people right next to us.  For our dinner we decided to order a XL cheese pizza and also a large white pizza.  We started with the white pizza and boy did it hit the spot.  The crust was crunchy, the garlic and herbs in the oil sauce were tasty and the cheese was decent as well.  Our red pizza was a similar experience as I imagine the cheese and crust were the same and while the red sauce was good, it lacked a little of the oomph that white sauce had.  Overall though they were two very solid pizzas that I enjoyed.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  The prices were good and the pizza good as well, now if they only had some inside seating."}
{"text":"As someone who grew up on New York Pizza, Im kinda hard to please. This place is probably the best in the neighborhood. Also shout out to the dude who just took my order over the phone for being concise, quick, and repeating everything back."}
{"text":"Just ate here today for lunch, not too bad $5.50 for two slices and a drink. The pizza was very good, good taste and the crust was really crispy but didn't cut the roof of your mouth, I like that. The place was also really clean, not too large but most people just grab and go. The staff was also very friendly and made sure to say hi and thank them for coming in to everybody."}
{"text":"These guys rule.  If you want thin crust gourmet pizza this it.  Finally, a good pizza place in North Scottsdale.  I'm sorry for all those out there that like Pizza Picasso I think it's avg. at best.  This pizza is worth the visit.  I put it on par with Cibo, Grimaldis etc.  I eat a lot of pizza and this is good pizza.  The other cool part about this little hidden gem is the family.  Meet Cosmo and the rest of the family and you will stop in just to say hi.  Seriously, very good pizza and nice family owned business."}
{"text":"Great pizza place in Bloomfield. I've never had a problem with orders and the staff is very nice! I've ordered many times before and will continue ordering in the future."}
{"text":"Super nice people, but the food just has not been that good so far.  For almost ten bucks, I wouldn't expect a chicken caesar to be made with red onions, cucumber and a Paul Newman's caesar dressing pack.  The pizza is good, but lots of places have good pizza in the same price range.  Other food has been both burned and undercooked at the same time.  They did a good job redecorating the place, and all the staff have been so nice.  I really hope they can make a go of it, but don't think I'll risk visiting again until I hear better things about them."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place given that its Yelp rating is tops and that it was plugged by Pop City Media's 2012 \"Two guys. 12 pizzas. One day.\" feature, even despite being towards the end of the 12-pizza day.  I got a small sausage and mushroom pizza.  Didn't like the toppings at all.  The mushrooms had a very strange and off-putting texture and color.  I suspect they were slice canned mushrooms, because I've had lots of fresh mushroom pizzas and they have NEVER looked or tasted like that before.  Bad start.  The flavor of the sausage was totally carried by salt... it tasted like salt and sausage-texture.  But -- otherwise, the sauce and flavor were pretty good, and the crust not bad.  It's chewy, though, not really my favorite style.  I think I could have enjoyed the pizza if I didn't get the particular toppings I chose.  I'd maybe get pizza here again if I had to feed a crowd or if I were drunk, but I'll stick to cheese or pepperoni next time.  To be fair, it is pretty good bang for your buck (the small pizza is substantial and around $8 with two toppings!)"}
{"text":"Ahh, I told myself as I ordered my pie that the former location of Carusotti's has to yield good pizza: \"why oh why did Carusotti's go?\"  Well, from the ashes of Carusotti's comes Pizza Italia, which initially appeared to be a reboot of the former business occupying its location but as I came to find out, is an entirely different animal.  I ordered my 'za and was quoted 20-25 minutes.  Everyone knows you can't rush perfection.  I waited in heated anticipation.    When I arrived, they weren't overly busy (this was on a Saturday night) but it wasn't exactly slow either.  I noticed one of the employees (perhaps part of ownership) was chatting with customers outside.  Hmm, good sign I thought.  I then approached the counter and saw through the window the chefs that were crafting my dinner.  There were two - an older and younger gentleman.  A woman also greeted me.  I was welcomed with smiles and the feeling I walked into a household.  I put the pieces together - this appeared to be a family run operation.    I paid for my pizza and wings and as I exited I was thanked for my business by the gentleman that was speaking with the customers outside.  Alright, I've driven home the point this is a friendly family run joint.  Now for the pizza and wings review:  The pizza (as others have mentioned) is not cracker thin, but crunchy and crisp.  Good tasting sauce, but where it really shines is the cheese and other toppings.  The sausage (which is stated as homemade) is REALLY good.  There were big chunks of \"bulk\" (i.e. no casing) italian sausage, not too salty, quality spices, and the onions that I ordered as a separate topping were \"slivered\" instead of diced.  But again, not overwhelming - rather they were mild and sweet.  The cheese used was a good quality creamy mozzarella - not too stringy but well melted and plentiful.    The wings were cooked very well, but slightly on the \"drier\" side as far as sauce goes.  The meat inside is juicy and tender, but these weren't the typical sloppy buffalo wings dripping with sauce.  Personally I'm indifferent as to either style, but a heads up for anyone who likes the more traditional style wings.  I also got 10 drums out of the dozen, which was a bonus.  They also serve pre-packaged Ken's ranch, which is a personal fave.  The pizza was cut into squares, which threw me off a little bit.  Good news is there is less crust, as they really top the entire pizza to the edge, however it was unexpected.  I was skeptical at first but ultimately appreciated the different preparation.  Don't confuse this with an Oregano's style super thin crust experience though - it's a much heartier pizza.  Could it be the imported flour they boast?  Perhaps.  Finally, they do deliver now.  Bad news - not open on Sunday, which is often a pizza day for me.  Maybe they'll reconsider at some point, but I'm not going to argue motivation for places not being open on Sundays (although for a pizza place is a little disappointing, especially during football season).  Overall they offer very tasty, well crafted food, quality ingredients and a unique spin on otherwise local mundane offerings.  Being it's a local establishment and family run gives me a reason to keep coming back.  A little on the pricey side, but again you are paying for quality.  Viva Pizza Italia!"}
{"text":"Yesterday at work, someone ordered pizza for all of us...for reasons that remain cloaked...in mystery.   Were they fattening us up for some sort of slaughter?   I had to play Batman and ask around to find out where the pizza came from. \"I dunno, just eat it\" was the primary response. Finally I cornered someone, tied him up, and got an answer.   \"Pizza Italia, man! Pizza Italia in Bloomfield! Don't hit me no more!\"  I kid the yahoos I work with and the Dark Knight Detective himself.  Their pizza is yet another solid Pittsburgh pie, the kind you can get at any number of pizzerias in the area. They tend to be similar in taste and overall constitution; tough, doughy, crackly crust, a sweet, chunky, fruity sauce that cries out \"I was made with fresh tomatoes,\" and a soft, slippery cheese that just slides into your mouth, down the hatch, and into to your belly. But it's a hella GOOD pie!  If this was the only kind of pizza that existed, I'd be content to munch on it for the rest of my dining days.    It was even good cold, and since old man Crowley can't be bothered to heat our building properly, the pizza didn't stay hot long.   Yes, we are but farm animals. We get pizza once in a while instead of slop and feed. At least the pizza's always top notch, though."}
{"text":"Super bomb thin crust NYc style...2 slices to go with a side of ranch was 3.75! Crazy yum and cheap best pizza in the area...loved!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. They use only the freshest ingredients and are reasonably priced. I love the combination of freshly grated cheeses and homemade pizza sauce.  The owners are friendly and have been in the business for a long time. The service is spectacular.  I recommend mushroom, pepperoni, or sausage toppings and steak or Italian subs.  Grew up in Pittsburgh always going to this pizza shop and anytime I came home from college and hometown visits even now, we always get pizza and subs from Pizza Italia.  Definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This is our pizza delivery go-to. Consistently good, not expensive, easy to order through Yelp. The only downside is that it doesn't always arrive piping hot, but a few minutes in the oven solves that. Big fans of the pepperoni pizza and the steak hoagies. Our favorite place that delivers to Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"I know I've Yelped this place before. Yet here I am being reminded to do so. I sometimes wonder if my reviews sink into a black hole lol. Also positive I've checked in here more than twice. But, I digress. I'm a Bloomfield resident and we have a couple of choices for pizza. I like this place. It's good for a late night slice or of across the street at Howlers watching bands and need a bite to eat. It's the kind of place you'd expect to see in New York. Service is friendly, blunt and fast.  The pizza is decent for what it is-greasy, cheesy and good."}
{"text":"Ordered from them last night, the owner or manager was really cool.  His delivery driver took off early, but he zipped out himself for the last delivery.  Pizza was very good, cut into squares, lots of cheese, great ingredients.    The only thing knocking them down to 4 stars, is they are pricey.  Not even just pricey, but almost overpriced.  I'm sure if you're just buying a couple slices over lunch, its not bad, but as a whole pizza, its expensive.  A large cheese pizza was 16 bucks, another 2.25 for each topping (I had two), add on tax and delivery charge, and the total was 24.75, NOT INCLUDING TIP!  Ouch.  Good pizza?  Yes, its VERY good!  Good value?  mmmmmmmmmm, not so much.  Try to find a coupon just to make it normal priced."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite pizza in all of Pittsburgh!! The crust and sauce on these pizzas are perfect. There's absolutely nothing fancy about it, just great pies. Its the type of pizza that's even better cold the next day! I recommend the meatball hoagies too. Love this place!! Just beware they don't deliver and you can't dine in - unless the weather is nice and they put a table out front."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sicilian style for delivery. It came 15 minutes early. I prefer the NY style after trying the thick crust. The sauce is sweet and has a lot of Italian seasoning in it. I ordered pepperoni and the toppings are skimpy. The pizza was ok not great. I still haven't found a great pizza that delivers to Troy Hill."}
{"text":"It's ok if you're really hungry and there isn't any other pizza place open. I didn't get sick. that was a bonus, slices were tiny for $1.50. No wonder they were $1.50. Salads over priced."}
