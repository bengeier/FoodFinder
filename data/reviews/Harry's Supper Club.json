{"text":"I had Friday Fish last night there, Wow a great salad bar, like from the old supper club days. One of the best in the areas. Very busy but staff was attentive.Fish reasonably priced and good. Would go back just for the great salad bar."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Harry's three weeks ago and had a drink  to size the place up and check out the menu.
Went back this evening with intentions of trying the food.
First stop was the bar where the beer I ordered cost me 75 cents more than three weeks ago..... no big deal - but still.
We then asked to be seated and were escorted  to the dining room.  
After a period of time it became obvious that we were invisible to the wait staff.  We then sat for another 10 minutes finishing our drinks and with no acknowledgment before we finally got up and left....
We won't be back.

Update 10/20/13  - Not surprisingly this place is out of business.  CLOSED."}
{"text":"Ate here last night with my girlfriend.  

Note to chef..blackened scallops does not mean you rub the scallops around on the dirty grill to make them black.  That's exactly what these tasted like.  no seasoning whatsoever.

She liked her perch and the fried shrimp was ok, though over cooked."}
