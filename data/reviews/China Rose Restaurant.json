{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch and we were quite unimpressed. First off, the benches need to be cleaned or replaced as they were extremely dirty and clearly not up kept. Second, the lid on the bottle of soy sauce at our table was chipped quite badly at where it screws onto the bottle and was a pale pink colour instead of the usual bright red. Not only did this make me feel uncomfortable about using the soy sauce, it also made me wonder if they bleached things while cleaning, hence the faded colour. 

The food selection was quite small, limited, not well replenished, and the flavour was off on most things. Honey garlic ribs without sauce or seasoning? Check. Hot and sour soup with so much vinegar in it that it burns your throat? Check. Chicken wings with no salt? Check. Under cooked veggies? Check. Burnt dumplings? Check. Unnaturally red sweet and sour pork? Check.

The only things I will say were ok would be the noodles and potato wedges, which were surprising crispy just like Costco fries. Needless to say, would not recommend and never returning again."}
{"text":"I have ordered delivery from China Rose in the past. Typically we have ordered full dish selections rather than combo dishes. Very good food we thought. The food has always been fresh, very tasteful and satisfying. Tonight I ordered a combo dinner for one with an extra side dish of salt and pepper squid. STALE AND HORRIBLE! It tasted like it had been sitting out on the counter for 2 days. The woman that I ordered from on the phone was not helpful at all. Never again :("}
{"text":"China Rose is hands down the best Chinese food in Calgary! Not to mention the service is great, the location is convenient with lots of parking and their buffet includes dessert. What more could you ask for!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite cuisine is Chinese, my favorite Chinese Restaurant is China Rose.  In 25 years of regular visits, I have never been disappointed.  The buffet is always hot, fresh, and delicious.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We went here due to exigent circumstances...we were in a North-East industrial park and we were desperately hungry.  We tried two dishes: a \"real\" Chinese beef ho fan, and a \"western\" sizzling rice plate.  The ho fan was actually quite decent, comparable to some of our favorite haunts such as the Calgary Court Cafe.  The price was good too, $8.99 for a big platter.  The sizzling rice on the other hand was a major disappointment: the \"oyster sauce\" was a thick, flavorless beige soup that drowned the rice and assorted meats.

The service was very good, and the restaurant is quite spacious.  We saw them refilling the moderately sized buffet quite regularly, but can't speak to the quality of the items contain therein.  Hopefully the sizzling rice is not indicative of the \"western\" dishes overall, as it made us in no rush to go back.  Suprisingly, the safer bet seems to be the traditional dishes, as attested too by some other reviewers here."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on my experience at beerfest 2012. Being told by a friend they have the best dumplings in town I had to find their booth. While getting closer people were devouring their veggie chow mein noodles all around us. Deciding to split an order of dumplings and noodles by time we got in line. Unfortunatly they were out of noodles. \" we will have more in 20 min\". Well! Was told that 4 different times in a 4 hr span. Once we finally got some I was very dissappointed. One bean sprout does not make it veggie chow mein and portion size inconsistent. As for the chicken dumplings. Not so great, crispy outside yes. But no flavor to the chicken, not a hint of any seasoning. For a place known for a good buffet, not be able to keep up serving only 2 items makes me wary of ever wanting to eat here. 

Wow, that's a long review for noodles and dumplings. Lol"}
{"text":"The chinese food is westernized, however, even then it is pretty good tasting.  I tried asking for a real chinese food dish but the asian server didn't know what I was talking about and then when he went to ask, he told me they don't make it."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese buffet in the city. This place is consistently good and has a ton of options to choose from. There's always new stuff on the buffet and the wings are amazing. The place is huge too, they have a private room, a separate bar, a second floor and they're opening the rooftop patio soon too apparently. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It's a solid okay. 
Sometimes the deep fried stuff is soggy and it's all pretty greasy but if you're looking for a cheap hangover Chinese restaurant this is your huckleberry for sure."}
{"text":"China Rose is the epitome of westernized Chinese food.  Most of it is deep fried, with the salt as the predominate spice being used.  If you are in the mood for some greasy food, then this will hit the spot.

Some of my more favorite items were the chicken dumplings, the orange chicken and the spring rolls.  All western Chinese food done well for a buffet.  Everything was hot and refilled regularly.  The biggest let down was the ginger beef - 90% soggy coating over chewy, stringy beef.  They should work on their recipe, because as far as western Chinese food goes, this is usually one of people's favorites.

The service was excellent - our water and tea was attentively refilled.  Our plates were removed promptly, and we were encouraged to make multiple trips to the buffet.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but I think that they aim to do a certain thing, and they do it decently. A-ok!

{"text":"It's an OK buffet.
The price and the quality of the food is ok.
Overall it's not a bad place specially for lunch time with coworkers.
It has a very good big space, it was clean and helpful staff."}
{"text":"We tried a sample of the food at Taste of Calgary and thought it was worth checking out.  Stopped in and ordered take out.   Our order was mixed up and ended up missing stuff, not a great start and it went down hill from there.  The chicken balls taste like that processed meat, ginger beef has no bite to it at all.  The one thing I did enjoy was the spring rolls, but don't think I will be going back for just those."}
{"text":"China Rose is one of the better buffets in Calgary without a doubt. It's an older restaurant that's been around for awhile and the staff are pretty good. The size of restaurant is is pretty big with a decent size of buffet table with plenty of options.

The food has always been good over the last few visits and I could confidently say it's consistently good. Freshly made buffet dishes and the ginger beef has been really good. One time it was off with dryness and taste but every other time it's been a solid awesome.

The location of China Rose is a bit shady if you haven't been to the North East Calgary before...but haven't had any issues with parking and it was worth the drive to go eat here. 
The overall experience is great and I would definitely recommend trying this place out if you are looking for a good Calgary buffet to try."}
{"text":"Live in the SE but went here with a Groupon. This is my new Chinese go to restaurant! Buffet has excellent choices and everything I had was fantastic. Clean, nice environment, and every single employee was friendly and attentive! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went last night due to another Yelp recommendation for Hot and Sour Soup and was not disappointed. Note there is no schredded pork in their soup but that is fine. All ingredients were in the right proportion with the right amount of \"chille\" spice. While there we also tried the mo chu chichen w/ wrap, chicken hot pot and pork  dumplings. All dishes we really decent with the chicken cooked to perfection in both dishes.
Most people go for the buffet, which we will have to try some time.

Our waitress seemed like it was her first night and was not sure of the food on the menu,the location is out of the DT core and the restaurant seemed non-tradional chinese. (Buffet House) Having said that, because of the quality of food and prices we will definately go back"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food, lived in delivery area for a year and had it so many times! Was always fresh and hot! There noodles an beef were amazing! Love the hot and sour soup! Tasty and large chicken wings! Awesome BBQ pork and tasty friend rice!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and there wasn't a lot of varieties. Mostly a bunch of fried meats saut√©ed in different sauces. They literally had the bare minimum of everything: two type of sushi, one cucumber and one fake crab rolls, a wonton soup and a sweet and sour soup, some jellos, some fries and chicken wings and spring rolls, etc. Don't expected Mandarin level if you are from Ontario! There's only one row of buffet if that gives you an idea what you're getting yourself into."}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet in Calgary, the place is clean, service is good, no msg, not salty and vegetarian friendly, the only thing I wish they had tapioca pudding."}
{"text":"Food is soo gross! You may as well go a store, find the cheapest crappiest frozen Chinese food and eat that because it would taste better and fresher than this place. Does not even deserve one star."}
{"text":"I have been there with my family twice.  This is becoming one of our favourite place to eat Chinese food.  Love the buffet concept you get to try all the variety of food there specially the fried noodles.  Staff are nice and friendly.  Definately recommend China Rose"}
{"text":"We decided to try the buffet on a weekday night, was not impressed at all. The food was less than warm and seemed to be sitting out for hours. Some of the food looked a bit suspicious (beef was white?) especially beef/chicken/oysters so I pretty much ate the vegetable items. The dessert section was okay, the ice cream scooper was sitting in some water that looked like it had not been changed for hours, bothered by lack of cleanliness.
Servers were really nice.  But unfortunately I do not plan on going back."}
{"text":"Food:  This is a westernized chinese food buffet, all you can eat. With that in mind, 4* for the food compared to many Chinese buffets in Calgary. 
Service:  5* servers are very attentive to serving you. Most of them are very friendly and appear to like their job.
My only hesitation is they label \"no msg\" in their food. I can definately understand if they don't add the msg flavouring in their food which is perhaps why they label \"no msg\".  However, they use hoisin sauce and other sauces that contain msg."}
{"text":"I have to admit this now become my favourite Chinese Buffet restaurant in Calgary; excellent service from the staff, and cooks are happy to make things fresh for you if they are running low."}
{"text":"My stomach hurts now, but I'm not sure if it's from frustration and disappointment or the awful food. We got seated and ignored until we flagged someone down and asked for menus...it is assumed that you will be eating from the buffet even though they have a full menu. We order, then get ignored for 25 minutes. At this point I flag down the only person around and order two caesars. The bus girl launches into this big explanation of how she can't make our drinks cause she's not 18 blah blah blah and eventually I interrupt and ask her to just pass on the message to our server. The drinks came out quickly and at this point our server goes \"oh you guys still haven't gotten any food?\" nooooo. We have not. She leaves for another five minutes then comes back to let us know that 'the kitchen lost' our ticket. Okay. Ten more minutes goes by and they bring out our wonton soup which was bland. Then come our spring rolls, which contained not a single vegetable. Seriously! My hubby was lucky enough to get one shred of carrot in his, but mine was pure noodle. I realize soon after that our deep fried wonton appetizer hasn't come yet and ask about it. Server looks panicked and goes \"oh I'll check on it\" then returns another ten minutes later with it. The wonton was chewy and stale and accompanied by the grossest sauce I have ever tasted. It was as if someone had mixed a can of vegetable soup up with some hot sauce. Ewww. 
So then come our mains. Cantonese chow mien noodles were half raw (server informed us that's how it is supposed to be) and the shrimp were also under  cooked. Yikes, on to the black bean beef and broccoli, which was void of any flavor at all. The only thing that we ended up actually eating was the fried rice which was edible and that's all I'll say about that.
When we try to pay our bill there is a lot of confusion about how much of a discount we will actually get for all this and how much our server has told us we will get. I get frustrated after ten minutes standing up at the till watching the guy try to do math...I eventually tell him exactly the steps he needs to perform mathematically but he ignores me. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"China Rose is a beautifully decorated restaurant with an abundance of fantastic, friendly servers. It is moderately priced and a little more expensive than other buffets in the area but in my opinion, you're paying for the atmosphere rather than the food.

Their items are hot, fresh, and restocked constantly. They do not use MSG in their restaurant, but their food is very salty. Some almost overwhelmingly salty. It is hard to eat much of any of their salt and pepper or garlic items, and the ginger beef is very dry with a hard batter on it that I could not stomach. I do however love their chicken wings, those are crispy and delicious. They also have a great dessert selection.

3 stars for the service, but they need to make some improvements to their recipes."}
{"text":"I was at China Rose for a conference last night and the lounge is a respectable rental space, seating about 70 people with just enough room for presenters and a display table.  I appreciate the free parking in a huge lot that is easy to find.

The buffet was the conference meal and I only scratched the surface, as I was emcee and didn't want to overeat.  I had chow mein, spring rolls, fried rice and orange chicken (I think that's what it was.  It wasn't ginger or lemon).  The chow mein was pretty dry but everything else was okay.  I think their desert selection is weak and from what I could see, there's only one traditional choice.  Otherwise you're opting for standard cake-type stuff or ice cream.  The buffet area seems crowded to me and they need to step it up in the cutlery department.  I shouldn't be eating my desert with a plastic fork in a restaurant.  

I ate at China Rose a few times years ago and was totally fine with it then.  I guess my standards have changed and I wouldn't say this is a place you'd want to bring friends or company to if you're in the mood for buffet and looking for a nice dining experience.  For me, it's good enough for a spontaneous and casual outing with my spouse."}
{"text":"I think this is a solid 3-star buffet. It has a great value, good variety, and numerous veg/non-veg dishes. Everything was palatable and some things were actually pretty good, so all-in-all it was a positive experience. The service is also great (I felt like my server was genuinely happy to see me) and the place is spacious and comfortable. 

We went because we were really hungry in the area and we wanted some cheap chinese food. Although H&J is now my favorite for that, I sometimes want to try something new. Therefore, we ended up here, and I was quite satisfied when I walked out. I believe that the buffet was $10.99 (Sunday night) and there were numerous appetizes, salads, hot dishes and desserts. A few of the items were a bit too salty (and the seafood dishes left something to be desired) but the westernized ginger beef, curried noodles, and orange chicken were pretty good. The egg rolls were pretty typical as were the dumplings.

In general, if you're in the area and really want a buffet this is a solid choice. Also, as  side note, the space is huge and there is a room to rent so it might be a great place for a group function. However, for a general meal, I don't really think it's worth a drive across town."}
{"text":"Top notch chinese food buffet, and even better menu items.  You should try the peking duck (call in advance to ensure they have it), the salt and pepper chicken wings, the lai yau (white cream sauce) lobster, black bean clams, ginger beef, and hot and sour soup with deep fried wontons just to mention a few.

I wish more people knew how good the menu items were instead of just coming for the buffet (even though that is good too)."}
