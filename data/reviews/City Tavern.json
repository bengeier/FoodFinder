{"text":"I give this place a 2 stars because the filet mignon sandwich was tender,but lacked flavor  that's it and I'm being generous, we sat at the bar stools with a friend for lunch and the bartender was quite rude and it was our 1 st time so we had some questions, it was Mother's Day so they were not serving the whole menu as they had a buffet, we asked the price of it and she ignored us, then there was a photocopy page with some food they served from the menu, again no price, I hate to get ripped off because happened to me every time I order from menus without prices, finally we got a regular menu to see what came with the food and stuff, I probably won't go back service is super high on my expectations and it sucked here."}
{"text":"We were hungry for steak. Stopped in and ordered the 14 oz. ribeye- medium rare. It was cooked to perfection and came with Parmesan mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  Our server Tracy was attentive and friendly. We will definitely go back. We sat in a comfortable booth in the bar area."}
{"text":"Never. Ever. Again.  Service was lousy- large party- but they knew we were coming.  Reservations but did not matter.  Took an hour for even the drink order. Over an hour for food - then another hour to get the bill.  Food was not the greatest either.  Gave it a shot-we won't be back."}
{"text":"I will never go back. Sat at the bar.  Bartenders were ok, but I looked at my online banking the next day & they charged me for my tab and someone else's as well.  I've never has issues with the City Tavern near my house but will think twice because of the mess now I have to go through to dispute this bill."}
{"text":"Wanted a restaurant close to mall for burgers. The atmosphere and food were disgusting. I don't know how they are in business.  It is one star only because we can't rate zero stars."}
{"text":"No go. Took over 45 minutes to get our wraps! Nothing offered for inconvenience. Marginal food and service."}
{"text":"1 of top 10, I think not! Disappointing lunch today. My guest had lobster ravioli served cold and quite honestly lacked flavor. I opted for vegetable panini with chicken. Panini was soggy and the cheese barely melted. Left 90% of it and went to McCormick and Schmick's next door to satisfy a craving."}
{"text":"Our server, Dakota, was amazing and on point. We had the Napa Valley Quesadillas... first glance I was concerned if I would like them but they were amazing. I had the Chicken Philly which was good... what you would expect at a restaurant... rather than a Philly shop. Overall, it was great service and good food."}
{"text":"Was served undercooked chicken when I complained they just gave me a coupon for 5 bucks, no manager on duty, supposedly general manager John will be back. Horrible experience, I took photos of the undercooked chicken, let's hope I don't get sick..."}
{"text":"The breakfast/brunch is WAY better than their dinners! Their dinners are just ok and are overpriced. But OMG their eggs Benedict...... Sooo good"}
{"text":"Oh City Tavern! To be quite honest, there is nothing very special about this place. The service is okay... you won't be disappointed, but you won't be wow'd either. The food is good, but a bit pricey in my opinion. The drinks are fairly expensive as well, and I've never been very impressed with their mixed drinks... BUT, somehow I keep coming back... I can't put my finger on it... The atmosphere is good - romantic (at least at night) with candles on the table. And the faint music is soothing... Oh wait, I know!  My girlfriend loves this place! ...That is why we keep going back! Plus it's within walking distance to the movie theatre! Mystery solved! ...Now I just need to find a new place that we both love!"}
{"text":"Went to this establishment today and from the moment we walked in we couldn't have been more disappointed.   The manager asked how many and when we said 10 plus 4 kids he gave us an extremely disgusted look.  Mind you this was at 3pm and there was one other customer.  Of course everything continued to go down from there.  Not bringing drinks to those that ordered,  taking 10 minutes to find out the soup of the day and then the worst bringing each meal out with 5 minutes in between each plate.  Of course 2 people never got their meal and the waiter never put it in and said I won't charge you then did.   Then all bills were screwed up and it took 30 minutes to figure that out.  Awful.  Never ever be back."}
{"text":"This is fast becoming one of my favorite restaurants.   For me it's up there with Good Food and Barringtons but a better bar scene.  That matters to me as I am currently single.   The staff is very well trained and the owner John Weinbrenner (so?)  is often on premise making you feel special.  And isn't that what we want ?  Yes we want great food and City TAVERN HAS IT !  They have it in abundance. I had the tuna tonight and it was great. Better even than Sullivan's who made that appetizer for me.  Steaks are strong but the signature items are what set this place apart.   But as I said earlier they really make you feel special. Like a VIP no matter who you are.   I feel prices are on point for the quality.  Come here. You will be glad."}
{"text":"I have found this place to be wildly inconsistent. Lunches are usually reliable but unspectacular and a little spendy. Two dinners here have been terrible. Waitstaff are all young and untrained, eager to check up on you in a hurried way, blatantly upselling the appetizers and specials of the day, and always selecting the most expensive option when you ask their opinion on various items."}
{"text":"This place was brilliant! We we able to get a nice booth no problem on a Saturday night. I had the pork chop and she had the steak. The portions were huge so we both took some home (see picture). Best place if you live in the area and don't want to drive up into Charlotte."}
{"text":"We went in for dinner last week with the kids. The hostess immediately greeted us and told us it would be a 10 to 15 minute wait. In the mean time, we stepped outside to wait for our table.  About after 15 minutes we were seated and given our menus, but not for the kids. We were informed later that they did have a kids menu. Ok but that didn't help when ordering. I need to know prices when I have so many kids.  We were asked by server if we would like to have bread. We said yes and they said it would soon be out. Sure enough it came after dinner.  I asked if they had sweet potato fries for the kids and they told me it would be extra which was fine with us, but the kids got regular fries. Someone didn't write it right, but I didn't complain. My husband liked his steak which I tasted and it was tasty. But my  seafood stuffed eggplant was not the best. Way too much sauce and some of the fish in there tasted really bad. And the steak was saucy as well. Too much sauce ruins the meal.  I will stick with the lunch menu instead."}
{"text":"Resonably priced and very convenient, City Tavern always pleases.  Try the Coconut Shrimp Martini, the meatloaf (with buffalo, pork, and veal), and the Blackened Seafood (sea bass, shrimp, and scallops). Full service bar makes up some good martinis."}
{"text":"The Tuesday prime rib special is off the chain. Among the most tender and juicy anywhere. Au jus was good and the horse radish dip has just the right amount of bite. Grilled veggies and homemade garlic mashed potatoes are an excellent addition. The starter bread and balsamic was outstanding as well. I've had the bison burger several times and it is also amazing. Only thing it needs is a proper set of fries as a side! Skinny frozen fries next to such an amazing burger is a crime, especially with nearby places service fresh cut homemade fries. Make the fries like you make to garlic mashed! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Arrived @ 6:15pm on Sat without a reservation, restaurant was fairly full.  We were seated immediately though.  No one even acknowledged our presence for 15 minutes.  We got up and left, once again, without being acknowledged.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"This appears to be a nice restaurant from the outside and the atmosphere inside is not bad. However, the food is not good. I ordered the Chicken Panzanilla and litereally received a chicken breast sitting in a flavorless brown broth. My husband laughed and said my dish should have been called \"Chicken Sitting in Water.\" And that is exactly what it tasted like. The sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes appeared to be missing. And where was the white wine sauce? My husband's plate was not much better, so we will not return."}
{"text":"A bit pricey and slow service. Food was just ok.  Wish The Mill was still there. Will not be back"}
{"text":"If you want to have a drink this is the place. There was 1 bartender that was AWSOME. (A guy about 6ft)He had another drink waiting for me before i ordered. The other bartenders just ingored the customers while this guy worked his butt off. Will go back just because of him."}
{"text":"Our waitress looked like she hated her life. Very unpleasant.   I ordered the mixed grill: filet, ahi tuna & meat loaf with mashed potatoes and a salad.  My steak had no flavor, Ahi Tuna was bland and the sauce that went with it tasted like something out of a nail salon. My meatloaf was dried out and crispy.   My potatoes were great and so was my lemon water. I normally don't complain about restaurants because my family owns and operates 3 but this place will never get my money again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food overall. I get the prime rib sandwich and have had their pasta dishes and burgers too. Service is a crapshoot - and we have never had good service when they are busy. Staff gets flustered and messes up and waitresses disappear cause they don't want to come out of the kitchen without your food after 40 mins. So go if the parking lot if half full, stay away if it is packed!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch yesterday and was really quite pleasantly surprised. Located in the Stonecrest shopping area, I thought it would be overly expensive but the menu had a wide variety of food at a variety of price points.  I ordered off the brunch menu (served until 3pm) and got the veggie omelet. It was great- filled with fresh vegetables and delicious cheese. It came with the breakfast potatoes which I was somewhat disappointed by. Maybe it was just the ones that I got but they were not crunchy and had no seasonings (not even salt). It also came with an english muffin which was pretty standard.  My mom got one of the pasta dishes from the lunch menu. It was a very large portion of food and she enjoyed it a lot (I didn't try it). Service was quick and friendly and the place was packed (about 1pm on a Saturday- maybe a lot of holiday shoppers?). My drink was continually refilled without me having to ask. Booth was comfortable and the ambiance was perfect for lunch (cozy and casual). Bathroom was clean.  The clientele was fairly yuppie but that is going to happen in this area of Charlotte.  Overall, this is a great lunch choice if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Poor service! Waited for 20 minutes just for the waitress to come to the table. Then we waited 45 minutes just for our food. The work staff is the most perfect example of back woods people. The food sucked. The only somewhat good thing was the free water. Would never go back again. On top of that we signed our recipt with the waitress's eye liner because there were no pens."}
{"text":"Visited Sunday at 4:30pm. Waitress took our order. After about 5 minutes I had to ask waitress for bread. She returned to tell us  bread was burned. Never did get any bread. I asked for a1 steak sauce. Waitress returned to inform me they had none. We waited what seemed like a long time for the check. Overall service has nosedived. It was not even busy. I see no reason to go back!"}
{"text":"My one and only visit was for lunch May 11 and I was not impressed. Our waiter was overbearing. He kept trying to push the specials and add-on items while we were ordering. I felt he was in the sales industry not service.  I had the New City Salad.  It was not worth $9.  It was mostly lettuce and I was still hungry when I finished. My husband ordered the chicken salad sandwich with chips and salsa. It arrived on the wrong type of bread and no salsa. The kitchen did quickly correct the mistakes. He said the sandwich was good and unlike mine worth the price.  My experience wasn't awful but nothing to make me want to return."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times.  The bar atmosphere is great and bartenders are attentive and good as well.  The restaurant however lacks.  The decor needs help to be updated to provide a better atmosphere and the food and service needs an overhaul.  I wrote a letter to the manager after going there a year ago and he replied that no one ever complains.  I did not feel that I was complaining...only letting him know of my (as well as the group I was with) dissatisfaction with our experience.  The group I was with will not go back and they go out on a weekly basis."}
{"text":"Wanted to try it.  Big mistake.  Not one I will repeat.  Food is a little pricey and the area we were sat in was cramped.  The waiter constantly bumped my chair during the whole meal.  Burger was average at best and the fries were cold.  My wife had the seaoned veggies and garlic potatoes which were hidden by the garlic.  I am always willing to try something once but in this case only once."}
{"text":"My first time here by my self for dinner and a drink. Sat at the bar bar tenders we're friendly told them it was my first time here gave me a few recommendations. I had the shrimp in Thai sauce good but thought it would be spicier. For dinner I had Cajun salmon and I mixed up all the sides they got the sides right and the salmon was cooked perfect. It's a little pricey for the portion size but was good I would trying them again"}
{"text":"At the beginning of the meal I was not impressed.  The table was sticky the service was not great.  We ordered the calamari for a starter and it was way too salty and was not a great portion.  I was thinking this was a totally waste until I got my bison burger. I was sooo good.  I recommend the bison burger to anyone.  I will go back for the burger and stay away from the calamari!"}
{"text":"First time here, lunch on a Friday. The Lobster Bisque was fantastic. Had the Thai Shrimp, just right not drowning in sauce. Nice &  pleasant ,very clean . The service was excellent. Joanne was gracious, effective & knowledgeable. Look forward to returning with my guest."}
{"text":"We went there because we had a gift card. Seems like a nice upscale place, complete with snooty hostess. (there was a second hostess who was nice and friendly there, too, though) The server Jake was a good guy, knowledgeable and friendly. The food left a lot to be desired. Filet Mignon overcooked, the appetizer bread had raw dough in the center, my wife's chicken had some kind of disgusting sweet sauce on it. Maybe a bad night, but I could have gone to a diner and enjoyed more."}
{"text":"Best kept secret around - Thursday nite - bar food - City Tavern SouthPark - 1/2 priced appetizers - also $10 petite filet - it was melt in your mouth delicious.  Very surprised with that price you also get yummy mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  Service was impeccable and ambiance was great - bartender even changed music to jazz to accommodate the \"older folks\" at the bar.  Same menu as Stonecrest location I think.  Interior is very classy - would imagine after the sun goes down it would be a very romantic place for dinner.  Will definitely make this a go-to place for the great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"A trip to a restaurant should not be an upsetting experience and yet mine was. The room was freezing cold (in the low 60s) and the food was absolutely abysmal. I couldn't imagine any circumstances where I would find myself eating at City Tavern again."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but really good food. Pleasantly surprised with the flavors. Also, they don't have a \"kids menu\" but we asked our waitress and she told us they do have kids items. She told us what was available and the kids picked from those."}
{"text":"Monday night 1/2 priced burgers. Good service. Super fast. Burgers perfectly cooked. Tasty. Great deal."}
{"text":"We've been coming here on Mondays for the last few weeks, at first alternating with Moe's but now every week.  What caused this?  They consistently have the best turkey burger I have ever had.  Going back, getting here can be a bit of a pain.  Traffic at the shopping center from Ballantyne is one lane so leave early, also getting out can be just as bad because of other construction on Elm and people not being able to figure out how a 4 way stop works at the entrance.  The restaurant has always been clean and service good, the menu has a lot of options and while the only things I have eaten are the angus burger, turkey burger and the fish and chips all were excellent.  If you look on their website you can see what they have on special for that day, otherwise it's a bit more than I like to spend for a normal workday lunch.  One downside and the reason why this isn't a 5 star review is that they have advertising screens in the bathroom.  This goes against the atmosphere of the place and is more fitting of a McDonalds or truck stop."}
{"text":"My last visit here was for easter brunch and it was just ok.  Nothing super special, the selection was kind of small and there were no sauces for the salmon or other meats that was disappointing since I'm a condiment queen.  The fruit was fresh but the few cookie-type desserts tasted of a long bad stay in a freezer somewhere.  I wouldn't go back again for brunch.  There are too many other choices."}
{"text":"I have been to a couple different City Tavern locatations and had the exact same experience. The food is not good at all, and is completely over priced. I've had their crab leg special and crab cakes and wasn't impressed at all. I would only return to get drinks, and because the City Tavern by where I live has great outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and food quality! Can't beat the value. A go to place for a local scene and fantastic atmosphere"}
{"text":"I went to dinner at City Tavern last night and I loved it! The ambiance was lovely and the food was delicious. I ordered the seared chicken breast in a mushroom cream sauce with seasonal veggies.  I even split the dish and it was plenty for both of us.  You must order the cauliflower mash as a side, it was to die for!   The rolls they serve are also very tasty.  I come to City Tavern whenever I am in town, and have never been disappointed :o)"}
{"text":"Popular lunch spot with a good assortment of dishes. Reliable and not fancy -- and that's good."}
{"text":"We went there as a group from our neighborhood.  There were 26 of us.  Each couple had a coupon and the manager/owner would accept only one.  We tried to discuss it with him.  He was the rudest person...nasty...insulting....not someone who should be the in a business that involves contact with the public.  This is a new restaurant and instead of going the extra mile with our group so we would come back and bring others (we live in a 55+ community), his attitude soured us all on ever going back.  The restaurant only has a 91.5 cleanliness rating which is relatively low.  This man used to own the City Tavern in Stonecrest which closed.  My husband and I went there once in the eight years we have been here - the reason...it was dirty!  Made the list of dirtiest restaurants.  Looks like this is going to follow in its footsteps.  Additionally the food was OK - nothing special.  Restaurants are a dime a dozen - there is so much competition.  If he doesn't make some changes to his attitude and restaurant, his time in Waxhaw is bound to be short. We would never go back here, even without problems with the owner.  It is just not good enough - nothing to set it aside from any other average place."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had dinner here this evening. I'm giving it 3 stars only because our server was so sweet and attentive. The food was definitely a 2, she had chicken fingers and fries, hot and crispy but nothing special. I had a house salad, completely ordinary, and the blackened seafood. The sea bass was really odd, like a big blob of fat. There were then 3 or 4 each small shrimp and scallops, very tasty with mashed potatoes but it really could have used some vegetables or something, for $23. It was a breeze to get in at 6:45 on a Saturday so that is a plus, I'd try it again in a pinch but that's about it."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try City Tavern for a while now. I feel as if I should have tried them years ago. It almost seems as if the restaurant may be cutting corners. The food is subpar. Most of what I had was previously frozen. My egg roll was cold in the middle and the calamari was incredibly chewy. My \"sushi grade\" tuna was pink, not red. It was basically over priced bar fare."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star ONLY because the the waiter was friendly and efficient.  We were shopping at the mall and decided we wanted to sit down and have lunch.   I wanted California Pizza Kitchen but the family wanted \"something different\".  Boy did we get it.  The table was sticky and my shirt kept sticking to it...GROSS!  That should have been my first clue.  We ordered our food and I got the summer salad with grilled chicken, my oldest got a crispy chicken salad, my son got a burger, my youngest got mac n cheese....and my husband got some seafood pasta dish with a calamari starter.  The food arrived and was pretty enough but my husbands calamari lacked any remote calamari flavor.  In fact, I'm fairly certain it was just breading.  My husbands seafood pasta had only two pieces of seafood in it and a side order of mashed cauliflower that tasted like straight vinegar.  The waiter kindly took it off our bill but by this point we decided we would never be back.  Once we paid our bill and left, you would think the experience would be over.  Not quite.  My husband spent the evening suffering from a clear case of food poisoning.  Suffice it to say, we won't be back.  And I rarely post a review to yelp but this experience inspired me to share with (or rather warn) others about City Tavern."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Small,high priced, tasteless portions. There are too many better restaurants locally in Waxhaw to settle for this. Creepy feel as well, similar to the restaurant in the Goonies movie, except no leads to a pirate treasure. It feels like they just went to food lion up the street for supplies. Where is bar rescue already?!!!!"}
{"text":"Noticed the last few times we have visited that there are fewer people than it used to be. We ate here early the other day and scallops were good. Fried green tomatoes were delicious. My husband got shrimp and grits and he was happy with his food. Nor sure where all the people have gone. The food has always been pricey and it just seems it may be a little pricey for the economy for what they have."}
{"text":"HAPPY NEW YEAR!  A few weeks back I saw an ad for New Year's Eve special offering of either a 3-course or 4-course special which included a choice of champagne, wine, or beer... in addition to  other beverages. We have been to City Tavern - Rivergate many times in recent years, but we had not been there in the last 6 months. I did not realize that the Rivergate location had closed and MOVED to the old Fishbone location off Gold Hill Road.  I checked with friends and soon called to make a reservation for 3 couples for 12-31-15. When we arrived the lot was nearly full... and the tavern was busy. We were greeted and seated promptly by the hostess. Soon our waitress Vicki had taken drink orders and brought the bread and dipping blend of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and shredded parm. (Always tasty... and an inspiration for home experimentation.) Vicki was cheerful and very helpful answering a few questions about the special menu selections as we each placed our orders for the four course special for New Year's Eve. Soon our salads arrived and we began a leisurely feast as we chatted and caught up on many events of the last year. The choice was either a Caesar salad or a spinach salad. BOTH are typically excellent, but I personally prefer the spinach with the house balsamic dressing (which I have BEEN UNABLE TO DUPLICATE at home). In fact, I highly recommend this salad with an ADDED petite filet as a delicious light meal. The balsamic dressing pairs well with steak... the reason I have tried a few times at home to clone it. Next course was Appetizer... a hummus with pita chips, a beef satay, or three bacon wrapped scallops. All were declared good... the bacon was crisp and the scallops were very tasty with an accompanying remoulade. The main course offerings were a Tuscan filet, a stuffed salmon, or a roasted chicken... accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus, fresh mozzarella slice and a tomato slice. No one in our party ordered the chicken, however, both the salmon and the Tuscan filets were perfectly prepared as ordered and excellent. As we were having our main courses, the manager dropped by the table to chat and confirm that we were quite pleased with the food thus far. Finally we got to the dessert... either salted-caramel cheesecake or a 6-layer chocolate cake. Each couple goy one of each and proceeded to share. The cake was a delight to chocoholics, AND the cheesecake also passed the chocoholic taste tests! ALL SIX in our party AGREED that this meal was excellent in every way, a great value offering by City Tavern for the evening, and that we had excellent service. We had plenty of time to enjoy our meal unhurried and to visit as long as we wished. I don't know when the move to this location was made, but the Rivergate team seems well-settled into a nice new home... and still providing enjoyable dining experiences for their patrons!  WELL DONE!"}
{"text":"Good food an very comfortable.  You can hear your self think and have a relaxing time."}
{"text":"Slow service- waited 10 minutes for our server to come greet us at the table while others passed us by.  Had to ask her about the food and drink specials.  She was just an order taker, not a professional server.  Bill was incorrect, which I'm coming to realize on this site that it's become a habit.  Manager is non-existent.  Never got a table visit and server was completely on her own.  I've been in nicer bathrooms in dive bars.  Smelly, dirty, and needs an overhaul.  I'm sure it's not happening anytime soon as it's been the same for years. Turned right around after I opened the door.  Made me sick to my stomach!  Carpeting in the dining room is dirty and stinks.  Televisions are 20 years old.  Seating and tables are beyond normal wear and tear.  Nothing has changed since they opened.  Sucking the place dry until you're required to re-image isn't the way to treat customers.  Food is average at best.  Nothing to write home about.  Sad portions that were lukewarm isn't my idea of a good restaurant.  Obviously they are hurting for business as I just received a coupon good for $12 here.  It immediately went in the trash.  Nothing special about this place.  I'm looking forward to it going out of business or a small fire in the kitchen to close it down to renovate or a new concept to come in."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food, had the mixed grill, superb. First visit very pleased."}
{"text":"I really wanted like this place, and to post a positive review here.  It's close to my house, and I would love to be able to be a regular there.  Unfortunately, the quality is very hit or miss.  The food quality varies, from well below average to average.   In actuality it probably only deserves a single star, but the occasional decent meal has me feeling charitable."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch and it was...good - the service and food was satisfactory.    Eating/drinking on the outdoor patio is....odd..because you're kind of sitting in a parking lot - I think that's why so many restaurants that tried to open up there have failed - weird location; however, their giant  bar is great and would be great for drinks after work.  I hope they survive because we had a good experience very shortly after they opened."}
{"text":"Lunch here was horribly disappointing, but in no way inexpensive. The salad I ordered claimed apple and avocado, but the slivers were pathetic, very few and in no way fresh. I added scallops for an extra $6 and they gave me two about as big around as quarters. The taco strips were so stale they were chewy. To make matters worse, gnats were all over us the entire time. For this pathetic salad, two measly scallops and iced tea, my bill was over $19 before tip! We agreed this was our last visit there."}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I remind myself why I haven't been there recently. I had the NY strip and the meat was tough but flavor was good. It was overpriced. My husband felt his seafood was undercooked and only picked at it."}
{"text":"Family of 5 visit.  3 Great Steaks, Love the Bangkok Shrimp.  Good bread, good fries.  Live Music was playing in the bar area - good stuff.  We ate in the dining area where the music was loud enough to hear and enjoyable.  Wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  Booth was super size big enough for 6 very comfortably."}
{"text":"I've seen lots of reviews of places but I .like to see for myself. I found the food here to be excellent. I also like the new Belly Rewards program. Way cool. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to all 3 locations and have always enjoyed the food. They even just started a new rewards program called BELLY and it's pretty cool."}
{"text":"Bread is great.  But we won't be back.  $39 for AYCE crab legs is $10 too much.  Artichoke dip crusty and aged.  Firecracker shrimp tacos bland and tasteless.  Really disappointed by food quality.  Waitress, however, was really nice and almost apologetic."}
{"text":"I went today and had one of the chicken dinners.  It was awful.  The chicken was very fatty and had a bad tasting sauce on it.  The Mac-n-Cheese was very chewy and I didn't like it at all.  The mashed potatoes were just so so.  The bread came to the table 2 minutes before the dinner so I didn't get to eat much of it.  I brought the chicken home to my dog.  I may call the manager tomorrow and complain.  I didn't want to make a scene because I was dining out with a new friend."}
{"text":"City Tavern is a franchise that has been struggling to have good food on a regular basis.  The new one in Fort Mill on Gold Hill road is woned by a gentleman who really could not care less if your food was not what was described - i.e. steak with asparagus, so they serve summer squash instead, or that the food was well prepared - the risotto was totally undercoooked, so he says:  \"I guess we w ill have to work on that\", no apology.  It's ok with him if the bar is close to 80 degrees - other people can handle it! HEY, THIS IS HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD SERVING HIS CUSTOMERS. if you can't deal with that - he thinks - too bad, I don't need your business.  I guess it is a good thing he doesn't need mine or my husbands because we won't be returning."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for our anniversary.  It could not have been worse.  The waiter was untrained and got our drinks wrong then told us that there was no more bourbon that we like (Maker's Mark) or Sweet Vermouth, so we could only have one drink.  Then he brought out 4 tiny pieces of undercooked dough that was supposed to be focaccia, and it was in a large wooden bowl that had a chunk out of it that left a sharp edge.  The bread had a piece of sandwich wrap over the top.  When he brought our wine (which was $45), he asked if we had had it before.  We said yes, so he just poured it in to our glass without allowing us to taste it.  The steak was good, but that is the only thing you can order and be sure that it won't be awful. The wait staff  changes constantly as does the chef it seems, so there is no consistency.   Skip this palce."}
{"text":"I tealize it was valentines day but it eas poor service, long wait time, wrong orfer,  many others arrived after my wife and me, andvserved before us.  Not an issue normally, but my wife and i are there twice per week,,,,not anymore.  I realize us exiting city tavern as a twice weekly habit will not put them out of business and not a threat at all, but they list litalty tonight. Again, it happens, but they had zero care or desire to care about  our experience , butbthat is why they lost us as steady customers. Not even a word wgen we tried to explain their failure tonight. They just didnt care."}
{"text":"I used to drive here- twenty five minutes it took me, to drink my favorite martinis in town.  Their martini list is long. I liked anything with cream added.  And their cafe magic is also very good.  Ask for their incredible FREE warm, soft bread served with vinegar and olive oil- their will be double, and triple dipping.  Lots of bread and martinis, makes a meal for me.  However, if you'd like more sustenance their BBQ ranch chicken nacho chips are amazing and I dont even like BBQ sauce or ranch!"}
{"text":"Be sure to try the sweet fry sauce! It's a secret fur the sweet potato fries!   Great people here! Good Staff."}
{"text":"I had a pretty good experience here. the food was great for the prices. When I first walked in I was expecting $20 and over for a meal but it was more like $20 and under.  I had a ceasar salad it was really good, better than some other places I fequent. I would order it again. Our waiter disappeared for a good 20 minutes, so we had empty drink glasses for a while. It also took awhile to get out check. they also seemed to have some good drink specials, especially compared to uptown."}
{"text":"I was trying to find somewhere in the Southpark area to meet someone to discuss business early in the evening so this seemed convenient.  I can't comment on the food because all we had were drinks, but I was completely throw off by their beer selection (or lack of).  For an establishment with \"tavern\" in their name, you might assume that would be a primary focus, but apparently not.  They had all the basic beers you would expect to find anywhere, but then had 4 or 5 other beers listed under \"Craft Beers\" .  We both tried to order something from the Craft Beer selection and were told they don't have them, or actually any of them anymore, they just haven't changed the menu.  So basically we were left just the basic run of the mill beer choices.  I find it hard to believe in Charlotte when there are several local breweries within 5 miles of this place they can't have any local or regional beers.  Even chain restaurants carry local beers now, so this is really unacceptable.  The server was pretty unapologetic about the menu being out of date, but I guess that's not really his fault.  I guess I'm just dumbfounded that a place in a prominent part of the city would have such a lousy selection.  Very weird."}
{"text":"I'll start from the top.  I called for a reservation and the hostess said \"the restaurant isn't even halfway full, so it doesn't really matter what time you come\". Should have been a red flag. When we got there, it appeared that the hostess didn't know what to do with us....she stood holding menus staring into \"not even half-full\" dining room for a good couple of minutes. We ended up at a pretty nice table though and the waiter came over right away. However, the very little english he spoke was barely understood as he whispered his way though his introduction. The drink order ended up being 2 glasses of white wine, a glass of red wine and a beer. 15 minutes later, he came with 3 glasses of white wine. Um... We corrected him and he got us the right drinks and took our food orders. I ordered the pork chop and strongly emphasized my desire to have it very well done. All the while straining to hear his broken english.  The food came, my pork was pink throughout. My fiance's steak was rare (he asked for medium) and his father's gravy was that out of a McCormick's dry seasoning package from the grocery store. I sent back the pork to have it cooked further and they, kindly enough, took it off the check because the waiter was clearly in the wrong. There was this \"apple chutney\" on the chop and anyone could've given me a side of canned apples with cinnamon flavoring and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference. The mashed potatoes were cold and had questionable chucks in it, that I really don't think were just un-mashed potato and the asparagus tasted like dirt.  They gave us a free appetizer coupon because of the trouble, which was also a nice gesture but to be completely honest, I don't know that we'll ever go back there. Maybe just to drink and as long the person waiting on us knows the difference between red and white wine. We'll wait til they start washing their veggies before we ever eat there again though...."}
{"text":"I have been to City Tavern several times before, and have always thought they have decent food, I am especially fond of their french fries.  This morning we went here to grab a little brunch, and it was really good.  I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict, which came with two large crab cakes and two poached eggs, over honey baked ham sliced thick, covered in a creamy hollandaise sauce, it was very good; tasty and filling.  My girlfriend ordered the breakfast burrito which was also very good, warm soft flour tortilla wrapped around scrambled eggs, and sausage, pretty good.  Each dish came with an order of breakfast potatoes which must have been fried in the same oil as the fries, because they were great, light, crunchy, and Delicious with just the faintest hint of oil to mix with the crushed sea salt and make this one heck of a good brunch, I left stuffed and satisfied,  Oh yeah we also got an order of Chicken wings, which were on special on Sunday, and they were very good too, crispy skin, and meaty wings, with a hot sauce, and delicious blue cheese to dip in, nice way to top of Brunch. The service was very good as well, our waitress was kind attentive, and accomodating, great job."}
{"text":"I brought my family here tonight and received the worst service ever. The food is great but when our server disappeared, the problems started. We waited for quite a while to pay our check. We signaled the bartender to ask her to find our waiter and she completely ignored us, twice! I had to take the check up to the bar, where she couldn't pretend not to see us, and ask her to find our waiter. She went into the kitchen and was screaming for our server. The  entire dinning room of (3 tables )could hear her. A very disappointing Saturday evening! Really bad idea to keep your customers waiting to pay!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I have gone to this City Tavern 4 times or so.   All I can say is wow.  Lets start with the food - they have a pretty good Grilled Salmon Caesar salad (which is one of my favorite dishes at a place like this). The salad is good and pretty cheap (I think its like 12 bucks).  The problem is the quality - sometimes the food is good, others its not cooked or just not what you ordered. Some examples: Once my wife ordered tuna which came out still frozen (as in it was still an ice cube). The entrees are SLOW to come out - Plan on having a few hours to eat. The staff is un-apologetic - They seem to think its ok to mix up everyone's orders and let us figure it out by going from table to table asking if some one else got your plate.  I can't say I've ever left the City Tavern thinking wow - that was a pretty good meal. Usually I'm just in shock about how horrible the experience was and how it was so much worse than i remembered it was before.   You know, this rating started out as a 2 then as i wrote i realized just how lame the place really is.   Bottom line for me - If you have 3 hours and a whole lot of patience, then the food is decent and its not really that expensive. Otherwise take your hard earned $ and spend it someplace else."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place and wanted something different near home.  Although they do not have a beer menu of what's on draft, they do have an impressive selection of local brews and some standard favorites.  After a little research we chose Sexual Chocolate Imperial Stout at 9.75 ABV, it packs some of a punch.   We were offered food menus and noticed on the back: wines are listed.  In my opinion for a 2 dollar sign establishment there should be no appetizers over 9 bucks, but that's me.  Although we did not eat here,  some of the food prices were a little high.  With that said,  the food may be worth it so a more thorough review is needed.   The bartenders were very personable and attentive.  Our bartender asked how we liked the beer which started a conversation.  I appreciate having bartenders that engage customers.  We did notice that the bar area tended to be a more mature crowd, definitely no millennials here.  I love the set up and ambiance of this place and just enough TVS to give you sports but not totally in your face which allows regular conversations to flourish.   We will be back. For now, it's only fair to give 4 stars as we did not stay long nor order food. So next trip will update review."}
{"text":"We had great service , excellent food with large portions . The 14oz ribeye was one of the best cuts of meat I have had in a long time . The bill was very reasonable also"}
{"text":"Food was great! Got a groupon for this, and liked it so much we gort a 2nd one. Food is great. We went on Tuesday which is martini night and was also prime rib night. Prime Rib was AMAZIng, and the scallops were excellent as well, bested only by the scallops at Blue uptown. Martinis were delicious. I recommend the watermelon, it was my favrite. The cream cicle was good too. ONly 4 stars for hostess. We arrived with teo couples ahead, and we stood aside and waited. Another couple came in and went up to the hostess stand and she sat them immediately even though she had already acknowledged us. Her response was that they were standing there. Very frustrating. So the trick is to stand right at the hostess stand if you want to get sat more quickly. Server was amazing, food amazing, hostess was ok. She did pitch in and help clear tables to seat people but overlooking us really peeved me."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Mothers Day Buffet this morning. A bit pricey, however the food was delicious! The new location is very nice as well."}

{"text":"My first experience here was terrible on all levels and I stayed away from them in their new Tega Cay location for over a year before giving it another shot. They've earned a 4 star rating. Their staff is aways warm and friendly. Even after just 2 visits the bartender remembered a particular way I prefer my sandwich and had it prepared as such even when I had forgotten to specify.  The bar area is a great place to grab a bit and catch up on some sports or spend time with friends. Great specials too. As I type this I have a bit of regret that I forgot tonight their filet mignon sandwich is the regular special and missed it. I will be there next week!"}
{"text":"Fabulous server Meghan Collins.  She made our meal even more  Pleasurable than just the delicious food.  We love City Tavern in Waxhaw N C.  Can't wait to go back.  Linda and Al Brickman"}
{"text":"Dessert to die for: Yesterday I had the most delicious Salted Caramel Cheesecake at the City Tavern in Waxhaw South Carolina. Actually had so much good food with my meal that I decided to get dessert to go. Didn't actually eat it until later that evening and was surprised at how really tasty it was, good thing I didn't have to share like I had originally planned.  I would highly recommend this superb restaurant off the beaten track. Service was prompt and courteous, seating us in a quiet corner where we were able to talk privately about the better things of life. Try City Tavern, I know you'll like it."}
{"text":"Not sure why this is rated three stars, our experience would give it one...spouse and I had dinner in the dining room due to the fact that the bar area was a little to loud with the live music entertainment, we probably couldn't hold conversation because we wouldn't be able to hear each other..so into the dining room, first off, nothing bad about the waiter, we placed our order, my spouse ordered the black and Blue filet sandwich with garlic fries and I ordered the chicken fajita sandwich on a low carb wrap, I asked if I could substitute the fries with the mashed cauliflower...I was told there would be an up charge of $4....WHAT???I then ask if I could substitute it with the seasonal sautéed veggies...waiter had to go ask the kitchen...I felt like I was being held hostage that I had to have the fries!!!..waiter came back and said I could get the veggies...Whew!! Our food arrived in a timely manner..first my order...my chicken fajita was okay, not too sure it was a low carb wrap though..sautéed veggies were average, nothing to write home about..my spouses order was ..well....interesting...the black and blue filet sandwich with caramelized onions and a horseradish blue cheese aoli..a heck of a lot more bread than meat..and absolutely no horseradish flavor what so ever...I said to her \"looks like you got regular fries instead of the garlic fries\"...we each tried them and sure enough, no garlic flavor, we called the waiter over and he promptly said he'll bring over garlic fries, when he brought the \"garlic\" fries over...they looked exactly like the fries that came with her plate!! Tried them and again...no garlic flavor!!!, so the waiter asked us if we would like to see the manager and we said yes...so, this man comes over and says he's the owner..not sure what happened to the manager...but we explained our disappointment with the fries and the aoli..we were told that they are garlic fries..and you know how they prepare them??? Get a load of this...they sprinkle garlic salt on regular fries!!! That's it!!!REALLY??? He then asked if we would like to have more garlic salt on the fries!!!..between the two of us, we ate maybe three fries...AND...for the horseradish blue cheese aoli ...he asked if she wanted more on her sandwich..like that's going to change the flavor?? I told him how dissatisfied we were with her meal. He sure didn't seem to care...now don't get me wrong... if I owned a restaurant and had an unhappy customer I would do SOMETHING to make it a better situation...like maybe take the price of the so called garlic fries off the bill...this owner/manager did absolutely nothing...was the cost of the fries going to make or break this business???...will we return...think y'all know the answer...."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a group. I will say you need reservations on a Saturday night. The food was excellent and the service was very good. The only reason for 3 stars and not 4 was it was way too dark. We could barely read the menu. When the food came out it smelled wonderful but we couldn't see the beautiful presentation.  I will definitely go back and hope they replaced some of the lightbulbs that were burnt out."}
{"text":"We went out Saturday night as part of our anniversary celebrations.  We've been to this city tavern a few times. But until now, never to critically assess the food.  The turkey burger looked fine, but when tasting it, we had the impression that it was probably prepared from a frozen patty.  When you've eaten fresh ground turkey burgers, you can tell the difference.  On the other hand, the Turk-buff-aloaf was wonderful.  At $15, this may be the best entree deal, not that this is in any way a slight to the fillet minion or seafood. Anyway, the portion was also delightfully generous, and there was plenty to put in the to go box."}
{"text":"It's always hard to find a place for a large group, especially with kids. For good or bad, there is always plenty of space here. The food is just ok, but it's nice to be able to relax and have some space."}
{"text":"While I agree with many of the disgruntle posts, having had mixed experiences here, finally we have had a good experience. The service and food was good. I hope they keep going higher!"}
{"text":"With a name like city tavern after a long day of painting, I was very excited to get some boneless buffalo wings and a adult beverage. New to the area, this looked like just the place! ...until I walked inside. My husband and I had casual clothes on and felt very out of place. I know when there is a place with lobster on it more then once on the menu, I ain't in Kansas anymore. We got the BBQ nachos which were and the chicken sandwich which were decent. The bisque left something to be desired. I felt like this place had an identity crisis, was it an upscale eatery or a bar and grill. Based on the name and expectations that come with it, I was a little let down here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in both food and service. I ordered the chicken dish I've had there several times before and my friend ordered the same based on my recommendation. The chicken breast was tough and flavorless and the sauce like water. I politely asked the server if something had changed because this was nothing like I'd had in the past and was very disappointed. She said she was sorry and that there was a different chef in the kitchen and left it at that. Neither of us could eat more than a few bites. When our server came back to pick up the nearly untouched plates, she brought the check and offered nothing more. I am not one to make a scene and hoped that she would have at least offered some sort of discount off a future meal with apologies to please give them another chance but not a word was said. What a shame. We so desperately need some good sit down restaurants in this area of Fort Mill. Unfortunately it appears that City Tavern is heading in the same direction as so many others that have failed before it."}
{"text":"City Tavern is a very quaint restaurant on Rea Road in Charlotte that has a very appetizing short and sweet meu. My husband, daughter and I brought a City Pass book from my daughter nanny (who was selling them for her son school).  We were hungry didn't feel like going home to cook and the book was sitting in between the seat of the car so we flip through to find something in the area we were in and WAAAHHH - LA \"City Tavern\" appeared. We attened the week after Restaurant Week, however the chef extened the pre-fixe menu for an additional week due to high demand. Though we didn't get the pre-fixe for $30 which had 4 course (all looked appetizing) we were HAPPY with what we did get. I personally had the seafood Capellini  and it was AMAZING!!! My daughter had a Tavern burger and my husband had Lemon grass seared scallops which they both demolished and looked me my plate to dig in (I NEVER finish my food so both of my MIKEY's ALWAYS clean my plate ;-) The waiter we had was very pleasant and helpful, ooh and they have drink specials every night. We happen to visit on a Saturday and the Margarita's were $5 and very good."}
{"text":"The good- I had a groupon so I didn't have to pay full price for the bland dishes consumed by my daughter and neice.   The bad- I ordered the blackened seafood. The sea bass was overcooked (rubbery). The scallops were undercooked (one under one over). The mashed potatoes were AWFUL, taste like boxed mashed potatoes with a few lumps to try to fool you into thinking they were homemade. Nothing like the ones in the picture.   The ugly- our waiter smelled like she had been out drinking ALL night (it was 5 in the evening). D'angela (the chick that answered the phone) was not friendly at all.   Groupon free meal or complimentary appetizer..nothing will get me back in the door."}
{"text":"Wide range of menu items, great service from hostess and waiter. Nice layout of Resturant and Bar area. BBQ chicken chips as appetizer was amazing. Will def go back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food, great smiling service and nice atmosphere.  Weekly specials are awesome and the menu has options for everyone.  Chefs are very accommodating to special requests.  Very convenient located for those is Waxhaw.  Plan to make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! I had the ribeye steak with Parmesan mashed potatoes, Asparagus and a blue cheese wedge salad. Wife had Gorgonzola NY strip. Really enjoyed the meal. Kids both had kids cheese burgers. Great meal cool environment. Ask for the secret kids menu!!! Meant to take a photo of my food, but totally forgot when it arrived it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Closed down"}
{"text":"We ended up at City Tavern for our Valentine's Day dinner because our plan A fell through. I wasnt disappointed in the meal, and dessert made the short comings in the meal balance out. We started with the rustic.bread and oil dipping sauce which was very good and the spinach and artichoke dip which was tasty as well, but could have been served warmer.  I had the Chicken Madeira, which I have had before. This time however, the chicken had hardly any flavor and the sauce was runny and just not appetizing. The mashed potatoes and veggies were decent.  My husband had a steak and was pleased with the size, flavor and cut and was able to substitute veggies for the asparagus side with no trouble. Our waiter was super attentive and I love the group effort of table service although they sometimes seem a little frantic! We had the red velvet cheesecake and it was very good, not too sweet, perfect layers of cake and cheesecake and the whipped cream off to the side (and out of my way...yuck). All on all a good visit."}
{"text":"The dinner hour was very busy. The first impression was a lot of items on the menu.   The crab cakes were good but could use salt. The slaw could have used less dill.   With the exception of 1 stake out of 4 meals all was cooked well.  The meatloaf was over seasoned.  All of our food needed salt badly.   Once we hit the salt the flavors were very good.  For my wife and I. Steak that needed to be salted was a mistake by the kitchen. We had to salt everything on the plate.   The restaurant is nice inside. Perhaps a little over lit."}
{"text":"I'm going to start out by saying I have not eaten here yet. Perhaps I should wait until I do, but honestly I don't have any immediate plans to do so.  I usually pop in with the boyfriend for a drink at the end of the day. The bar is rarely very crowded, which is a plus for me since I hate cro"}
{"text":"Really great food. We had the salmon and a wedge salad. The blue cheese on the salad was amazing. The salmon was cooked perfect. Not a tv in sight which is big plus for us! Great music too!"}
{"text":"Food (steak) was not good quality. We were there at 8:30 and we felt rushed because they were slow and wanting to close. No bread. Waiter was nice but slow to respond to our simple requests."}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all. The interior was comfortable and nicely done, the service was quite good (more on that in a minute) the menu was a little limited and maybe a ~little~ on the expensive side but not outrageous. All their sandwiches come with the option of few different kinds of bread including low carb wrap and whole wheat bun. I'm working on eating better so I got the Steak sandwich in a wrap ( yeah I know. . . small steps) I also subbed out vegetables for the fries. The waiter, aware, that I was trying to eat a little healthier had them steam the veggies instead of doing them in butter. Now honestly I would have preferred he offered that rather than just up and have them do it but it was a nice gesture that I appreciated and will count as being good.  One small touch that I really like are McCormick salt and pepper grinders on the table. These produce nice fresh ground salt and pepper without the fuss of a waiter standing at your table with a pepper grinder the size of a baseball bat. It was quite good I'll be back"}
{"text":"We ended up because another was closed so we stopped and the closest place. It as nice enough when we walked in. Nothing super special but decent.   We got the menu and realized that the prices were pretty high. It was fine, we didn't really mind too much. But it wouldn't be a regular place for us. There are specials at night so we got $5 burger. They were ok, nothing to write home about. Sweet potato fries were really good. My daughter got the pasta and sauce.... yuck. The sauce was bitter and pretty gross. My daughter ate it though... I could barely make it through one bite.   Service was really nice but SO slow. Painfully slow. I was literally looking for anyone to take our payment just so we could leave. I'm not sure what was going on but it was slow and there waitress was still missing.   Honestly we probably wouldn't come back here. Maybe to grab a drink if it's open and we are in the area but not to dine. Wasn't worth the pricing by far. A"}
{"text":"Yeah, they're closed.  Shock of the century.  Overpriced drinks and a pretentious menu that didn't live up to its vision.  For this neighborhood in general it was too ambitious.  The same restaurant downtown probably would have soared because Uptowners tend to ignore prices more.  But in Dilworth it's trying too hard.  Just be a pub!  People love pubs!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try after rave reviews from co-workers.  Prices are reasonable,service is good and great location. The food was pretty tasty. Be warned a few items are misnomers. Ex. Garlic fries were shoestring and not very garlicky? No need to describe plain items as fancy/premium sides. Would come back and try brunch which is offered on weekend."}
{"text":"My experience here was great. I ordered food for takeout at the bar, and the bartender was wonderful. She immediately took my order, and constantly checked on it and gave me updates. It was a pretty busy night, so I was surprised she had time to constantly check on my order. I had the chicken saltimbacca and it was great! Will def be back."}
{"text":"The City Tavern serves brunch on Saturdays from 11am-3pm and Sundays from 10:30am-3pm.  Since David & I love brunch, we had to give it a try.  A good choice here is the Veggie Omelette ($8) which comes with zucchini, squash, carrots, tomatoes, baby spinach, and cheddar-jack cheese and  a side of breakfast potatoes.   Also, they feature one of David's standby favorites, the Western Omelette (also $8) which includes ham, peppers, onions and cheddar cheese.   On the day we were there, they were not extremly busy but had a steady stream of customers.  The service was fine, the food was fine, but nothing stood out as special or really outstanding.  If we happened to have a coupon or if they were doing a special promo we'd go back, but otherwise this probably won't be the first place we think of when we're in the mood for a yummy brunch."}
{"text":"I honestly don't really care for City Tavern. I've tried the wings and also the Chicken Panzanilla. They were both awful and I could barely take anymore bites (Was sampling my boyfriend and his sister's plates). So why the 3 stars? WELL.. I was introduced to something magical. Let me teach you about the MONDAY ANGUS BURGER SPECIALS! Angus Burgers with toppings are 50% off on Mondays. That means you can get a hearty-sized Angus burger with sauteed onions, mushrooms, pepper-jack cheese and a side of garlic fries, mashed potatoes or veggies on the side for around $6!! Trust me, stick with the Angus burgers and you'll love Mondays."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. After waitress brought our drinks and took our order, we did not see her for 45 minutes. The manager was going to look into the situation and he left and did not return for at least 15 minutes.  Entire dining experience was not good. When food finally came some had to be returned because to cold to eat  Until this place is under new management, we will not return. Bad use of good space."}
{"text":"I see why they are on groupon.  gave this location (South Park mall) two chances and I'll never go back.  they keep their candied walnuts mixed in w/their blue cheese, so who knows about the rest of the food.  they also can't seem to get their reservation rules clear btwn the people who answer the phone, the hostess, the waitstaff and/or the manager.  plenty of better restaurants in the area to try."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I have to agree with some of the other reviews, this place has a name that does not go with its interior. If you are going to name a restaurant \"city tavern\" then that's what it should be, not some wanna be fancy over priced burger joint. The food is okay, nothing to write home to. There are much better restaurants in the city with better food at a better price. We tried their fried green tomatoes, mine are much better and cost 1/3 the price to make. My boyfriend and I went to the Cheesecake Factory last night and we both got dessert and it was less to eat there then at City Tavern (which I also had a coupon for) I don't recommend this place when there are so many other great places to eat in Charlotte. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Decided to eat here for lunch having eaten at other city taverns in town. We were promptly seated and the server was polite and friendly. I got a Cobb salad and they turned my sandwich into a wrap. It was really good, and the Cobb salad was fresh and great. My wife was pleased with her BLT sandwich and BLT salad which also were done with nothing to complain about. This is a nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Starting with first impressions on our inaugural visit, we were greeted by a friendly staff and a very attractive dining environment! It was a very slow Sunday evening with more staff than Customers. Nicole was very accommodating in moving us closer to a working monitor and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu.   Unfortunately, the kitchen staff didn't deliver on her descriptions! Nicole began by touting the bakes potato soup as a thick hardy cream broth with potatoes and bacon.  Once ordered, she quickly returned to inform us that the chef was making more and it would be a few extra minutes. Not a problem as the Cats were playing and it was cooling down quickly outside. Hot soup sounded perfect!  10+ minutes later she reappeared with flavorless cool white water...No thank you! My Bride ordered the sliced prime rib sandwich. She found it a tasty, satisfying and an item she would order again. I ordered the Black & Blue filet tip sandwich. The minimal amount of under cooked beef tips lacked any peppery taste (black) and blue cheese flavor was totally absent. The \"killer\" garlic fries were fresh but missing any semblance of a garlic flavor. Decided not to push the issue.  We are big supporters of the Waxhaw restaurant scene and this one will need some work to survive as dinners can't eat ambiance and your staff is only as good as the food they serve!"}
{"text":"This place is good.  It does not have a great beer selection for a place that calls themselves a tavern, but it will do.  They have food specials (it seems) every day of the week and I think drink specials as well.  I know Mondays are half of burgers and they offer brunch on the weekends.  For a place close to my house, it is a winner.  City Tavern also offers pricier menu options, which makes me a little confused about what they are trying to be exactly.  It bothers me somewhat when I restaurant can't decide if they want to be upscale or not..."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today, had a coupon to use.   We started with the Lobster Nachos, which were different and delicious. For lunch, I had a build-your-own-burger and substituted parmesan mashed potatoes for the fries. The burger was ok, nothing special and the potatoes tasted like the loaded mashed potatoes from Chili's. Again, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  Our waitress was wonderful, and very attentive. Good service.  Not sure if we'd go back in this capacity - I would probably choose Bad Daddy's ... but it was a decent enough meal."}
{"text":"Would definitley recommend this place! Great selection of food, wide variety. Atmosphere was clean and our waitress, Sasha was on her A game. We were in and out in a very timely manner. Food was excellent - I got the shrimp carbonara. Definitely needed that after a long day and I have another meal for tomorrow. Check it out folks!"}
{"text":"Not worth one star. My boyfriend and I went in with another couple and had an awful experience. Our friends arrived ten minutes prior and still had not been greeted by anyone. It was another ten minutes before we were greeted and given menus. We were sitting in the bar at a high top table. Once we finally had drink orders taken we gave her the food order as well in hopes of speeding it up some. She forgot the order and came back almost 15 minutes later to ask what we had ordered so our food hadn't even been put in yet! Food finally comes out, and my boyfriends seafood Mac and cheese was similar to a can of beeferoni you would get at the store for a buck. My friends lobster nachos consisted of about ten chips with three small pieces of lobster. Hardly worth the $14. My seafood trio was over seasoned by a ton. It looked like a whole can of old bay was dumped on top. The bartender finally came to see how our food was about twenty minutes later when the whole table was finished eating and totally out of drinks. I don't like causing a scene and complain in a restaurant so we kept quiet, especially after a manager was standing at a table with what appeared to be employees getting drunk and yelling very loudly--this clearly would have been zero help to us as he did not seem to care that he was ruining our experience as he yelled over everyone right next to us. I can deal with sub par bar food, but the service was the worst I have experienced in a long time. Definitely not worth what we spent in there. We will never be back, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The restaurant looks nice enough.  The food, unfortunately is not good. The ahi tuna had been frozen and was very bland. The risotto was the AWFUL. I couldnt eat it.  We had a coupon for 50 bucks worth of food and it took them until after we ate to know if they were going to honor it or not."}
{"text":"First time here for breakfast-got the raisin French toast-not done! Bacon-very tasteless-bloody MARY-I think they forgot the main ingredient! Nice atmosphere-great server!"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon (3/3/18), lots of good college basketball on TV...yet, only 6-8 people in the bar. Went for the \"Oyster specials\" that they advertise and have signage for. Ordered 2 dozen. They were dry, semi-frozen, absolutely no liquid, came with 3 crackers and no cocktail sauce.  Ate one, tasted off. Tried another, still not right. After looking at them more closely, you could tell these were not freshly shucked. It is obvious they shuck ahead of time (days? Weeks?), freeze and wait for the occasional sucker to bite on the \"oyster specials\" and come in. Then just toss them on a platter... We told the bartender and she went to the kitchen manager who wanted to insist we pay for at least 1 dozen. Are you kidding? It was obvious what they do for their raw oysters, and pathetic that a manager wouldn't acknowledge, or offer to take it off our bill. Bartender went to battle for us, however. \"Customer's not always right\" based on other reviews and my experience yesterday.   Won't fool me again. If you can't shuck and serve FRESH oysters, don't bother. They should stick to draft and bottle beer. Seems more of their core competency. Bartender was very nice, sweet and apologetic. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My last two attempts to place a to-go order have been futile.  I called for 10 mins before someone answered the phone, each time. Just a few minutes ago,  when someone finally answered, I'm put on hold. I hung up after 2 mins. And yes, I could habe placed my order at the restaurant, but that defeats the purpose of ordering ahead if I have to sit and wait 20 for my food to get ready."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened here. First off all,  the server ,who was very nice,  brought all the courses within minutes of each other.  That wasn't the the big disappointment of the evening. The food was bland and tasteless. I had the lemongrass seared scallops with risotto. Instead I got scallops swimming in this strange lavender colored sauce. I didn't taste lemongrass at all . My date's streak was tough.  He was hacking into it like an autopsy. The crab cakes were more cake than crab. Very disappointing. To top it off , I told the hostess, who didn't seem overly concerned, the ladies room had very little soap and no paper towels.  I wont be back."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and well prepared. Have never had anything less than great at the Steele creek city tavern location.   Service is always friendly and timely. I just have never shared the same negative experience as the other reviews here.   Also, coupon options alway exists, which make this place even that much more affordable. Just recently had the buffet and everything was well maintained and fresh. The best buffet as my mother-in-law proclaimed (and she's a tough customer)."}
{"text":"Cold, buttery noodles, tough chicken, over priced entrees, staff that lacks personality. The server called my wife \"Hon\" more times than should be acceptable by the entire population of this state for the entirety of this decade. Kids meal for $6.50 included a small bowl of cold, buttery noodles topped with a sparse sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Where most restaurants serve portions that are way to large, City Tavern is not guilty of this! Not nearly enough for the money. Full of old, out of touch clientele who only eat there because they have for years. Out of business soon, I bet!"}
{"text":"For some reason I read bad reviews about City Tavern but I had a wonderful lunch there.  The food was fresh, delicious and reasonable.  Amber, our server was friendly and attentive.  I will definitely be back.  I'm glad I tried this restaurant for myself!"}
{"text":"Staff has provided excellent service each time I've been here. Food has been top notch as well. Draft beer selection is decent as well."}
{"text":"Great place to go in SouthPark. Best restaurant at the mall. Excellent service, good food, fair prices, and good looking clientele."}
{"text":"I've drove past City Tavern many times on my way to the Container Store & the South Park mall, but finally made a point to stop and eat.  Oh, and I had a groupon to use.  Nothing on the menu really jumped out at me.  It was a tough decision for what to get, and I ended up going all crazy and getting the wedge salad with buffalo chicken tenders with a side of mac and cheese (and I just realized I left my leftover mac and cheese sitting on the table in a box...ugh).  My boyfriend went with the lobster ravioli and because we had to spend $40, we also started with the Sea Bake appetizer.  The appetizer was delicious, little pieces of scallop, lobster and shrimp all melty and delicious.  My salad was very heavy on the dressing, I actually think it was held in place by dressing so it wouldn't fall off the plate by accident. The mac and cheese was sold to me by the waitress, but little does she know, I'm a mac and cheese snob.  It was okay, it still doesn't measure up to the creamy gooeyness of the mac and cheese of the Black Sheep in Center City Philly... anyways... I'm a tad bit sad that I did leave most of the mac and cheese in a take out box on the table. My boyfriend's food looked good, they had a good amount of lobster raviolis but he commented that they weren't amazing.  He also had a side of sweet potato fries that came with an \"interesting\" sauce.  We sat outside, but our table was wobbly and there was a good amount of broken glass on the ground. Not really what I was expecting from City Tavern."}
{"text":"If I could give this so called \"restaurant\" 0 stars. Tonight's the first time I have ever had to wait an hour and a half for food and our waiter had horrible service on top of that. I do NOT suggest anyone eat at this establishment."}
{"text":"Average food. (Remember the 90s?) and very slow even when there was only one other table in the restaurant.   Good service just everything else was a bit lacking"}
{"text":"Love this place! Seafood pastas are awesome(especially the seafood cap). Rack of lamb was tender and tasty. The filet mignon sammie, well I can't put into words how good it is! This place rocks. Best mojitos in town too!"}
{"text":"So against my better judgement my husband and I went to City Tavern again for dinner last night. We had another Groupon that was expiring and didn't want to lose it.   We sat at the bar because there were no tables available in the restaurant. It took 8 minutes for someone to acknowledge that we were there. Then another 10 minutes to get our drinks. We did get menus right away when we asked but sat there for another 15 minutes after we got our drinks to place an order.   After we ordered, I was watching the Giants play on the TVs above the bar and I noticed SWARMS of fruit flies. SO disgusting. If you have a clean bar, you don't have an issue with fruit flies. I ended up swatting them away all night.   It took 45 minutes from the time we sat down until we received our barely warm appetizer and then nearly another 20 minutes after that to receive our steaks. I didn't get a steak knife and had to ask for it twice. I had to ask for a glass of ice water FOUR times. My husband's steak was fine but mine was so raw in the middle I'm surprised it wasn't still mooing (I ordered it med rare). The asparagus looked like it was several days old and the french fries tasted weird (I'm guessing the oil in the fryer needs to be changed). Service was terrible all the way around. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Certainly not the worst restaurant,  but you have much better options. I have been a few times, and it's about average. On one occasion I went with a couple who had a $5 certificate they were using. Although we were paying separate, I was denied the ability to get the evening special, because of their use of this certificate. Seems petty too me, but apparently their rules. The waitress was somewhat condescending about it, and so I have never been back. A better alternative, albeit a little farther away, would be Harper's at Carolina Place. Similar menu options, and much better service and food. In the area, Friday's, or Fuji would even be a better option."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!   We were traveling thru, staying at the KOA in our RV..... we went at about 5pm on a Thursday night, & what a crowd!  Wonderful happy hour - had the petite filet special....our best meal across the country!  Belinda took great care of us, & was a really fun waitress!   Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch expecting a simple meal that wouldn't take a whole lot of time. I was mistaken.   Food: the food tasted decent and was fairly warm when it came to the table. I had the seafood Mac and cheese which was alright. By the time the food came, I was starving. My girlfriend got the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. She says it tastes odd, and the fries at McDonald's are more satisfying than the ones that came with her meal.   Atmosphere: the atmosphere here is that of a typical sports bar. Moderately loud mainstream music with a couple small TVs scattered around.   Service: at first, I felt so bad for the elderly lady who served us. She seemed sweet. Though we could quickly tell that she wasn't sure what was going on. We received our appetizer on time. It took over 45 minutes after we received our appetizer before we received our food. We were about ready to pay for the appetizer and leave before they walked out with our entrees. It wasn't until I reminded our server about our food that we saw it 15 minutes later. We also had a mishap with a spilled water early on, and another empty glass, both of which were not addressed by the server until we had to flag her down to ask (after I had asked her about the status of our food).   Overall, I will personally not be coming back. As a very experienced server for multiple establishments, this has left me pretty dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  We had the filet tips and seafood trio, and that was pretty good. Could be from frozen, but fairly tasty. Not a good beer selection. Fair for wine and they have wine specials. Dining room is ok, kind of blah, but its just a big square room with tables. Feels like somebody's gonna drop some 80s country and start a line dance.   But the kicker was the service. And not so much the wait staff, but what has to be management and their poor training. Simple things that any wait person should know. Would one actually place an employee out to the public without knowing the person knows what they're doing? Very risky and falls short here.   Best to stick with Maxwells or Trattoria if you're in Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Recently took my staff here for a celebration dinner and boy was I let down! The service was incredibly slow. I waited 10 mins just to get an introduction and drink order from the waitress. What's worse was that we were one of maybe 10 tables in the entire restaurant. We had cold food & wrong food. We constantly had to ask for our waitress just to get refills. Quality of food was okay once the order was right & hot. It's less than a mile from my house, but still not worth the drive..."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch today at City Tavern for an early Mother's Day lunch with mom and dad.  Located at a prime corner spot at Stonecrest Shopping Center off of Rea Rd, my mom declared her lunch was the best crabcake that she has had in Charlotte (beating Village Tavern, Firebirds, 131 Main and a few other random places).  Upon entering around 11:30 on a Friday, the hostess seemed like she may have wanted to be elsewhere, but our waiter, Darren, quickly made up for that.  He was very friendly, informative and helped dad decide between a few different choices.  Most lunch choices were between $8 and $11, with a pick 2 (1/2 sandwich, salad or soup) for $8.  The food:   Appetizer of Spinach Artichoke Dip served with tortilla chips was excellent ($8).  Creamy with lots of spinach and cheese and nice big pieces of artichoke.  Perfect amount of chips for the amount of dip - how often does that happen?  It was quite good, although I thought $8 for the small portion was a bit much, but it was good, and everything else was beyond reasonably priced for lunch.  Mom had the crabcake sandwich which is served with fries for $9.  Remoulade on the side. Beautiful crabcake that was full of meat instead of filling.  Nicely browned, about the size of a thick burger.  She was very happy.  Dad had the special of the day,  fish (tilapia) and chips for $7, which was a steal based on the portions and quality.  He said the fish was well prepared, in a Newcastle beer batter, but the batter wasn't super heavy (which is a good thing for him).  2 large filets served with shoestring fries and a chunky cole slaw.    I had the pick 2 with the steak in the grass sandwich (shaved prime rib, spinach and provolone on a soft but toasted hoagie roll) and the blue cheese wedge salad.  Perfect portion for lunch at $8.  The meat was tender and not stringy, like some shaved meat sandwiches can be.  The salad was a fresh and crispy 1/4 wedge of iceberg, topped with tomatoes, bacon, blue cheese and a tangy, creamy drizzle of blue cheese dressing.    Our drinks didn't go dry thanks to our attentive waiter and the additional staff.  Food was brought quickly and everything arrived hot or cold as required.  Check arrived promptly, and paying was quick as well.  Mom had a coupon (of course) for a free lunch with the purchase of a lunch and 2 drinks, so it was an even better deal.  (they also have the same coupon for dinner, which she left with me - so be out on the lookout for those for an even better deal).  Great spot for lunch and I will definitely return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding.  The server even let us know that the garlic fries were not what we were expecting.  They were just going to be fries with some garlic seasoning sprinkled on.  The Ahi tuna appetizer was good.  The fried asparagus appetizer was small.  It was 6 spears.  Our entrees were okay.  Steak & seafood - nothing that stood out about either.  Live in the neighborhood but prob the only visit."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and the server came and took our order very quickly. The atmosphere is almost like a high end pub, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The food is a bit pricey. The whole place is very clean, and I left very satisfied. When I can afford it again, I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was amazing.  Been here a few times.  The new server Robin was a delight.  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Nice, clean-cut decor, great menu, kid-friendly and super service.  Need more?  We went for lunch and the menu options were interesting and adequate for the most choosy patron.  Tried the tempura battered asparagus with chili ranch and they were delicious.  Wish the portion was larger.  Hoagie sandwiches were great.  Many like Philly steak-cheese, but these were upscale with sliced prime rib.  Wife had variety with spinach and cheese, I had mine with mushrooms, onions and cheese.  Rolls were soft and your salivating mouth could easily take in the sandwich.   Make certain that you bite into your sandwich over a plate or you will have a dry cleaning bill for sure.  Very juicy.  Fries were perfectly fried.  Will give it a try for dinner, but bet it will be crowded as it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Went to the new location in Waxahaw and the food there was awful!! Their staff seem to be inexperienced and at one point I just wanted to pay my bill and leave. This is not a place that we will be going back."}
{"text":"I give the Tavern a 3, though it's a low 3.  The 3 that means I ate it and didn't die, but I won't be returning.    The entire experience made me keep looking in corners and on lapels for cameras to see if I was getting Punk'd.  Sadly, Asshole Kutcher did not pop out at the end of my meal, which leads me to believe this place is just a hot mess.  I do enjoy dining at the City Tavern and Stonecrest, but this seems to be a completely different experience.   Formerly a Mexican joint, which was previously a Morton's, located on the Barclay Downs side of Southpark mall near McCormick and Schmick's and Dick's, the whole vibe seems forced.  Oddly placed potted plants, a bar area that spills over into the entry so you have to twirl around people to exit, a bathroom that had not been cleaned with anything other than a passing glance in quite some time, a hostess who seemed a little frazzled as she was getting chatted up by a waiter, only a few tables seated with a few hard working wait staff, but quite a few who just seemed to be milling about... it was just off in every way.  But I had been shopping and I needed food, so... I waited for someone to come take my drink order after being seated.  And I waited.  And.... I waited.  Seated next to women who were old school in scent application (they were both bathed in opposing and equally offensive eau du toilettes), I was afraid the hunger and breathing through my mouth was going to cause me to pass out.  Finally, a young man who was working the large party room on the other side of the glass doors took pity on me and took my order.  He was friendly, and efficient.    The food: A summer salad consisting of strawberries and blueberries was offered.  Since it is December, I passed on that and ordered the shaved prime rib sandwich with fries.  The fries, of McDonald's width, were completely devoid of any kind of seasoning.  I never put salt on anything, ever, but had to liberally douse these with salt.  The shaved prime rib was tender, but had several fat pockets that were bleh.  At first I thought the meat was juicy, but I think it was just greasy. Covered in cheese, the meat was flavored okay, and the toasted bread was tender on the inside.  It was good enough, but nothing worth repeating.  The young man that FINALLY waited on me was friendly and efficient, some of the others could take a lesson since the crowd seemed pretty sparse at 6:30 on a Tuesday and per table tips need to be high.  My drink was kept filled, condiments were brought, check was brought and picked up in a timely manner.  But the food was just *shrug.  I wasn't terribly impressed with anything and with all of the choices in the area, there is no reason to spend money on a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"A friend and I went on a Thursday evening and had to wait 20 minutes for a seat, although they did not seem overly crowded. As we waited, we had a drink at the bar. The hostess came over about 20 minutes later and told us our table was ready. We then waited about 15 minutes to be acknowledged and for a server to come to our table. When he did, he told us that the restaurant would not be able to accommodate us because their whole kitchen staff just walked out. The manager then came to see us and gave us three $5 restaurant gift cards to use on a future visit. Needless to say, we will not be back in a hurry. Maybe it was just a very off night, but the restaurant seemed to be very poorly run. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Do like City v. Hickory Tavern better.  They have a more complete menu, specials on certain nights of the week, like Tuesday $1.25/ounce prime rib and other specials throughout the week.  Check the website to see what is what for lunch and dinner.  There are daily lunch specials, also.  This Waxhaw location has a nice meeting room which we have used for our book club meetings.  They provide wait service and you can order from the menu.  Makes for a pleasant occasion and you have privacy along with a quieter place to chat. And they will provide separate checks.  The bar does a good job, service is friendly and accommodating and the food is good."}
{"text":"Overall not as bad as some of the previous reviews. But of course I opted for the burger which I custonized to my taste. Not the most difficult item to make.....neither are fries. I did order TRUFFLE fries but my fries had NO truffle flavor in them at all. The bartended swore that she smelled truffles....well I use truffle oil ALL the time and I assured her that these fries had NO truffle in them.....I don't believe she knows what truffle oil is supposed to smell like. Nonetheless she didn't charge me for the truffle fries which was a PLUS!  Nonetheless the fries were good. They were garlic herb. Burger was very good, and they got my CRISPY bacon order correct.....I HATE soggy bacon! Burger was medium well....I ordered medium but it was still good.  Got their house Cabernet which was decent....it was a Mondavi Vendage...or so the Bartender said. Seemed better than a Vendage.....only $5.50 so not a bad deal at all.  Note that I came at 330pm....an off time. So I sat at the bar. Can't say what their normal service is like. Bartender was cool and attentive.  I will try City Tavern again. Good experience with a couple of miscues. But compared to VILLAGE Tavern. ...Village wins every time!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best location that I have been to. We had a quick dinner before heading over to see a movie. My wife had the chicken ceasar salad which was huge and had a lot of chicken on it. She loved it and said the ceasar dressing was good and not overly \"anchovy tasting.\"  I had one of the burgers which was cooked perfectly and was also of a large portion. The staff was fantastic and knew that we were in a time crunch to catch our movie so despite a busy Saturday evening they were very accommodating and we made it out just in time."}
{"text":"Friends said go back, they have improved they said. Thursday evening, no one in restaurant, everyone in bar area. Bar is full of Seniors getting half price appetizers some just ordering water or one drink, server/bartender has to spend all their time on the typical seniors demands while the customers that want drinks and food suffer."}
{"text":"I had the mixed grill, hubby had the meatloaf.  8:30 pm on a Thursday night, no wait.   Food was great for the price, although plating could have been nicer, hence the 4 stars.   Our waitress, Morgan,was upbeat, positive, bubbly and made the evening enjoyable.    2 very nice dinners, 1 glass of wine, 1 tea, good atmosphere,  $65- including appropriate tip.  If the chef had taken one more minute on presentation, 5 stars. We will return. :)"}
{"text":"Great customer service when I tried repeatedly to call the Fort Mill location to no avail. Savannah at this location offered to have her manager text the Fort Mill manager to ask them to answer their phone! Above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Update, when we arrived at the restaurant the \"less than friendly\" hostess told us they were only seating those with reservations, which I would have made had they answered the phone! They did end up putting the three of us at a table and at the end of the meal (very mediocre) I asked for the manager. He came to the table and I explained the unanswered phone calls. He apologized, but barely, and toward the end of the conversation said that the phones had been out for two hours that morning. I have no way of knowing if that was true but I will say he seemed put out and unwilling to accept responsibility for any part his staff had played in the morning's activities. Will NOT be going back - that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Went to City Tavern for the third time for a small birthday dinner. This last experience was awful! Worst $100 ever spent. Our waiter was young, slow and inexperienced. The bartender made my amaretto sour incorrectly, twice. She obviously did not know that the drink comes in a smaller glass. I just switched to beer. Such a classy place though! Inexperienced staff. The manager even came to our table with the server and said not a word about anything. Really? We won't be back. The previous professional staff obviously found greener pastures."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends about a week ago and I will go back. Our server was excellent and the manager came over to ask if we were enjoying our meals. Great overall customer service. I had the blue cheese and bacon ice burg lettuce wedge salad and it was really good. My friend has a strict, restricted diet and the server worked with her to make sure she could find something she could actually eat. She got grilled salmon and steamed veggies. It looked like it was perfectly cooked and she said it was great. My other friend ordered a burger and loved it. The last friend ordered a pasta dish and it didn't appear to be very good. I'm just going off of appearances. She didn't say either way if it was good or not. Two of my friends ordered dessert and while they said they were good, the desserts are pretty expensive. Not worth no matter how great they are because the pieces were small to average, in my opinion.   I plan on returning to City Tavern. Some of the menu items are way overpriced but some are reasonable. I especially appreciated the excellent service we received. So many restaurants lack in service these days."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch early on a Sunday (11:30ish) and there was no wait but an average amount of ppl seated. We were seated in a corner both by a window which was nice however there was a constant stream of dust falling from the dusty beams overhead.   The burger was juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. We got the burgers as the brunch menu was limited to a bunch of egg dishes and some waffles.   I would come back for dinner but it's a bust for brunch."}
{"text":"Meh is right.   Had high expections because I really liked their CLT location.   Sat in the bar area.   Bartender was good and waited on us.  Bar huge and looked like a good place to hang out and watch the game etc.   But the food was just ok......the CLT location prepared the food much better.  Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Was excited to see they would be moving to this location.  That's where the excitement ended, we gave them a try and they had no clue what was going on, no idea of what was on the menu, really slow service, decent food but very pricey and more like snack portions, chalked it up to just moving and maybe there was some confusion because of that.   Returned two more times with the hope that even though this place wasn't new it's just new to this location that they got back in the grove, we kind of expected the service to be better.   Second visit was nothing better than the first, my wife ordered the lobster nachos, sounds appetizing and exciting.....  Well until they plop this plate in front of you with a total of 15 nacho chips, each has a tiny piece of lobster on it and some weird cheese ($15.00 !).  Third visit we where seated outside, that's where we sat for half an hour, no menus, no drinks, nothing.   We are done, not going back, why would we, poor service (horrible), very expensive, extremely small portions.    I give them 9 months, I'd give them 6 but obviously the ownership is a little slow and it's going to take them a little longer to see that this restaurant is being supported by their other location.    Go back to NC we really don't need another crappy restaurateur that thinks the customer always comes last."}
{"text":"I have been here a few tomes but only for lunch.  I have always had the chicken panzanella, and it is quite yummmy.  Also at lunch the prices are really reasonable   I think at night time this place is yup city, but they do have a wonderful outdoor patio on top of the restaurant that's cool."}
{"text":"The food was good. Best bison burger I have had in a long time. Our server, Amber, was amazing. She was attentive, but not overly so. She didn't try to push stuff off on us that we weren't interested. I did not run out of tea even once.   The only issue I had was that the menu was way too expensive for a lunch menu. (We were there at noon.) It seemed more like a dinner menu. When you go to a restaurant for lunch, you do not expect to see fine dining prices.   Lower the prices and put more lunch-like options on it, and it'll be five stars from me. As is, it is highway robbery for the food."}
{"text":"My brother in law and I stopped in to watch the game the other day. What a disappointment! The bartender was too busy visiting to notice we were there apparently. When she finally acknowledged us we ordered drinks and some apps. The fried green tomatoes I ordered would have been my first and last. Luckily my brother in law tried them and said they were just bad, and assured me they shouldn't be that tough and chewy. His nachos remained on the plate after we both gave them a try. When the bartender asked if we wanted another drink we mentioned our disappointment in the food and asked her to take it away. We got the bill and we were still charged full price for both plates that we didn't even eat. When we brought it up, the lady told us that there's nothing she can do. We both vowed to never go back which is unfortunate because it's walking distance from my their place..."}
{"text":"If you want to pay 15 bucks for a dish that tastes like a lean cuisine than go ahead. My fiancé was ok with his steak but I was not impressed with the chicken I got. Not crowded at all. Service was good."}
{"text":"Superb filet - special on Thursday! Excellent staff! They do it right. 4 in our party and all loved the food, atmosphere and people. We will return on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Just had a delicious meal and fast courteous service.  Saturday night and moderately busy but the wait staff was friendly, attentive, took our order promptly, refilled our beverages as we waited a short time for delicious steaks and salads.  By the way, try the new city salad... So beautiful you are almost reluctant to eat it, but you will be so glad you did!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but they lost a star by bringing out The main course before the salad was done and rushing us to leave"}
{"text":"Hubby and I visited this morning for Brunch after seeing the Groupon offering. We are in hunt for breakfast spots so we gave it a try, well we were seated quickly and the server was there in reasonable time. He informed us that today's special was built your own omelet, so husband being the omelet snob he is went straight for that option. I too went for that option. Also had a $3 mimosa which was fab.   Well when our food arrive, the server informed me that they did not have turkey for my omelet, but I was thinking that I never asked for turkey. Anyway I dive into it and realized that they did not put any cheese in it which I did ask for. And they gave me potatoes which I wanted to exchange with fresh fruit. So it was not looking good for the server. My husband also commented that it was greasy and he ordered egg whites to be healthy.  Overall server was ok, besides getting my order wrong and the food was ok, nothing to rave about. I will visit for dinner, seen I did buy the Groupon for it. I hope dinner will be better"}
{"text":"I really like this place! My boyfriend and I went because we had a coupon and it was delicious. The atmosphere was quaint and the staff was polite. I had the smothered trout with rice and vegetables. It was amazing and good size portion too. I probably would have had enough to take home if I hadn't been so hungry. I also stole a bite of my boyfriend's farfalle florentine and that was pretty tasty too. The night was topped off with a piece of tiramisu. I usually don't like tiramisu but I changed my mind after having it at City Tavern. This is definitely the place to go for a glass of wine or a casual dinner. It's classy but it isn't a place where you have to get dressed up. I plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Our family went to City Tavern for the Father's Day Brunch this past Sunday and I HAD to share our visit. It was delicious!! The breakfast part had the fluffiest eggs, bacon perfectly cooked and delicious grits!  The lunch part had the BEST mash potatoes and little steak medallions, that melted in your mouth!! Service was outstanding! We will definitely be back!! My only complaint was a little hot in there (but 90+ degrees outside) so not a deal breaker! Great place for a crowd or a couple!! Kudos City Tavern!!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning here for a while.   City Tavern is a fairly expensive restaurant to have such crappy service. My friend and I went in yesterday (Friday) around one in the afternoon. It was dead, no hostess at the door, nobody greeted us for a while. The hostess was nowhere to be seen so another server, who looked like a third-shift Waffle House Nanny McPhee, hesitantly sat us. Mind you, the restaurant only had a total of like seven patrons, and there were several empty tables but she threw the menus down on a filthy booth that had crumbs and French fries on the seats.  My friend and I looked at each other like, wtf? but the woman had already walked away so we hesitantly wiped off the crumbs ourselves. There was a dirty RED washrag on the table adjacent from ours. Aren't those supposed to be white? Just saying.  The hostess appeared from the bathroom looking frazzled and honestly strung out in my opinion. None of the female servers were wearing a standard uniform. For the price of the lunch menu, they should have at least combed their hair that morning.  By the time Eric greeted us we had made a decision not to eat there, but instead each ordered a Bud Light and asked for the tabs. He was the only good thing about this place - or maybe it was the beer - so we tipped him accordingly even though we did not eat there.  Unless management gets a better wait staff, I'll stick to the City Tavern by SouthPark."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last night for a few beers and maybe an appetizer.  I had a coupon from the \"Welcome to the Neighborhood\" packet I got in the mail - $15 towards food, dine in only.  Perfection.  We sat at the bar, the bartenders were all very friendly and quick with refills and checking on us. We glanced at the menu and the prices for meals looked a little pricy, but not too bad.  Steak, fish, etc for $20+.  But we only came here for drinks and apps - so let's talk about those lobster nachos....  Oh my gosh.  We went with beers and decided on the lobster nachos.  Best decision ever.  Huge chunks of lobster mean adorned each nacho chip, that was also smothered with hot sauce and cheese. Mmmmmm. My mouth is watering just remembering it.  I completely suggest this for an appetizer.  Its plenty for 2 people, but runs $14, so it was awesome with the coupon and a few drinks.  I'd definitely come back here, for a date night or just to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"For the price it's not all that. Before I review the food, I need to share my experience fom last night.    Upon arriving at the restaurant we were seated at the table next to the patio door.  Within the first minute we realized the wait staff and customer traffc flowing in and out the door would be annoying, nevermind the heat that radiated to our table everytime the door opened.  We asked our server to be reseated.... your'd swear we asked for their first born.  We got the 'ok' to move, but no help moving our drinks and such.  Once reseated we noticed the huddle and pointing on the part o fthe staff up at the bar.  Ummm... guys, we are actually the paying customer.  But here is the funny part.. The hostess proceeded to seat 3 more groups at the table. All of which asked to be moved within minutes.  I was jealous.. the third group actually received help with their relocation.  The food.. all our meals were cold. Lobster nachos not worth it! You can find a better meal and mediocre service many other places in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Great experience! Had the Chicken Panzanilla and a basket of sweet potato fries. All was wonderful! Wait staff did exceptional! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ummm, it was fine. I wish I had a more definitive thought either way, but it was so nondescript that you could've told me I was at any one of the many other restaurants it's been, and I would've believed you. They haven't changed a thing since it was The Mill (did The Mill change anything since it was Fishbone?). Man, it just feels so dated in there.  They open at 10:30 for Sunday brunch, so the fella, his parents, and I got there then. We were the first people there, but the manager and three hostesses seemed pretty disheveled when we walked in. It took a few minutes for the manager to get the menus and show us to our booth, which was at the far side of the building, and he felt the need to fill the walk with numerous questions like \"what made you come in today?\" Ugh. Once we were seated, our waitress was good and promptly took our order, refilled coffee/water when needed, and was really nice.  When the fella's mom ordered a waffle - of which there was literally an entire section on the menu - the waitress had to explain that they actually didn't have any waffles. Ummm, ok. She said they were still waiting on new menus, but no one had printed them yet. So his mom switched to the french toast, which is also what his dad got. I got the western omelette, and the fella got the breakfast burrito. Everything was... fine.  I wish I had something to note that really stood out, but I'm not even sure I'll remember this visit in a few days. I wish something really good would move into this building since it has such an awesome location, but I fear City Tavern is going to go the way of all the other restaurants that have been there."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood restaurant to visit. We went for an early lunch and had a Groupon to use. I liked the brick and decorations inside the restaurant.  It was really empty. For a while we were the only ones on the dining side, but customer service was great.  Having been on a diet and eating less, we both had cravings for pasta. I got the shrimp carbonara and my husband got the seafood Mac and cheese.  The carbonara was good, but not the best I've ever had. I wish there were more shrimp. And a piece of bread would have been nice to sop up the sauce. My husband's was good, but he had some type of hard bone or shell in his dish. He told the waitress and they offered to make another and gave us a discount.   We would still go back because the rest of the menu looks good and the manager was super nice."}
{"text":"I like City Tavern quite a bit.  Despite their location in the upscale-ish Stonecrest shopping center, they are pretty reasonably priced.  Some of their dishes can scrape past the $20 mark, but you can always get a burger for $8 (or $10 for bison... but more on that in a bit).  Additionally, on Mondays, they have all burgers half off!  The interior of the restaurant is pleasant enough.  It's classy without being uncomfortable.  The service is decent: some of the servers can be a little sassy, but that doesn't bother me.  Their New-American-type food is good, too.  I've had several of their entrees, and while nothing is mind-blowing, it's tasty and much better than the commercial chains.  If you want an appetizer, you really must try the tempura asparagus.  They are fried perfectly so that the asparagus remains crisp and flavorful, and the wasabi ranch dip complements them perfectly.  Oh yeah, I said I was going to talk about their bison. City Tavern serves a bison burger, which is pretty unique for this town (at least in my experience).  The patty is very flavorful and most, and they'll actually serve it with a nice pink interior if you request it.    The one qualm I have with City Tavern is their fries.  Sometimes, their fries are really, really amazing.  Other times, they are just okay.  I need to figure out their schedule.  My routine for a night at Stonecrest usually proceeds thus: Borders, City Tavern, movie. You should give it a try if you're looking to get out but stay low key."}
{"text":"We had City Tavern cater for a friend's 40th birthday party in Tega Cay. The staff were extremely courteous, on time and professional. There was plenty of food to go around and reasonably priced for the amount of people we had (35 ppl.). The food was also delish!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar listening to the ignorant bartender with a horrible attitude complain about everything. Asked what beers were on tap he says theres a lot   Like I was bothering him. Ordered half price app calamari ($9)? Flat out awful. Breading tasted like progresso crumbs. Had the runs for 2days after. Female bartender playing with her hair cracking her gum and talking with one patron the whole time. This place is trash!!!"}
{"text":"Today I used my Groupon for City Tavern.  Although there are several locations available for whatever reason it slowly made its way on my list.  I ordered the macroni (contained crab, crawfish and shrimp) and the turkey/salmon sandwich.  I was amazed at the food portions and the taste of my dishes.  Fernando C was my waiter and he provided excellent customer service, which nowadays is hard to receive.  The only flaw was someone forgot to mop the front entrance I could hear the stickiness.  Other than that I will return b"}
{"text":"Very good meal, service, and atmosphere at a reasonable price. The chicken saltimbocca was excellent!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Overcharged for the burger. Runny mac and cheese. Righteously indignant waitress. Asked to speak with manager....never came. Paid cash, and was asked 5 minutes later how much change was wanted back...instead of bringing all the change and letting us decide the tip. I guess the 1.00 each of us left for tip wasn't enough so the waitress angrily tried to return it at our car. YES OUTSIDE!!! We had to hear about how her son plays in the NFL and she's not going to be treated like that. NEITHER WILL WE, won't come back even if its free. RECOMMEDATION: find another crappy place with bad service where the mediocre food is overpriced...you will still be better off."}
{"text":"Service was decent enough. When the waiter brought bread we laughed because it was a tiny tiny amount (five pieces, plus some awkward cut sides) for six people. 1.5 in squares of what I believe was supposed to be focaccia. No FLAVOR.  I had the Sea Bake Starter. It was supposed to be shrimp, bay scallops, and crawfish, in some sort of creamy cheese sauce. NOT WORTH THE PRICE. There was shrimp and a couple of tiny pieces of crawfish. The sauce was watery, and the whole dish lacked flavor. Totally blah.  There was also a chicken quesadilla. Yet again. No flavor to it.   Overall, nothing great at all and wouldn't recommend at this point."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday evening around 7. We were told it would be a 25 minute wait. After about 10 minutes, we were told it would still be about 20 minutes and we could sit in the bar area if we wanted to. So we did. It took about another 5 to 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged by the waiter. After placing our order, we waited about another 30 minutes without being acknowledged by the waiter and without getting our food. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"My guess is there was no management or owner present during our visit as the staff seemed VERY unmonitored and disengaged. Food was adequate. Service was poor."}
{"text":"This place was close to my hotel, and had a $5 off coupon from the hotel so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the \"GOURMET MEATLOAF\" - and while it was good enough meatloaf, I honestly found nothing \"gourmet\" about it. Wanted a salad, and had to order on the side. No bread included either.  The service was friendly and quick, and the food was prepared well.  I doubt I'll be back, as nothing really impressed me about them and considering the $14 for meatloaf that was nothing special, I'll be looking for a different place next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Okay, seriously I do live close by, but the food is pretty decent here and I really like the double deck outdoor seating when its not too hot.  Good draught beer and we never seem to have to wait too long.    Try the ahi app and the blackened seafood for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow. What can I say. Really weird place. Restaurant atmosphere was encouraging - nice bar, good lighting, low noise. However... The menu was almost unreadable (type 4 pitch perhaps). Server was completely unprepared/untrained/uncaring or all three. I was actually embarrassed for him. Restaurant management needs to do more to adequately prepare their employees. Food was timely. Tasteless. Salads had way too much dressing. Risotto was mushy. Veggies were greasy. Salmon was perfectly cooked for my taste. I really wanted to like this place. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Just got home from our dinner at City Tavern. Definitely was not a busy night but they were short a receptionist, so we had to wait for one the servers to seat us. The bbq chicken chops that we had as an appetizer was yummy. The house bread would have been better if it was hot. The steak I had was alright. The server we had was very nice and attentive. It was his first day as a server so I tipped him 20%. Btw they have a groupon for this place so it was worth it. Will be coming back for appetizers."}
{"text":"We have  eaten there several times. Noticed an inconsistency with food. For instance I always order the blue cheese wedge salad. Last time I got a  small wedge of lettuce with liquid  blue cheese dressing, not chunky like the last time and  no bacon , tomato or other stuff on it. The French fries with our last burger were limp and not crispy. We like the burgers which are always tasty. The chicken wings, nothing special. The seafood bisque, soup of the day was delicious. Have had the Tuesday special steak dinner, very good. My dining mates said the seafood mac and cheese was great. We have always had nice friendly service Probably will go back but not as frequent as before."}
{"text":"The food was ok....not as good as it should've been for the price. The wait staff was horrible!! Took forever to get a drink and menu. They disappeared when it was time to place my order. I WILL NOT be back. It was not worth the price"}
{"text":"What a disappointment ... Bar service seemed fine but once we sat down it was downhill.  Waiter was cold and didn't engage.  This continued throughout the meal. Drinks were slow in coming despite it not being full.   Food - major disappointment.   Appetizers had the shrimp (good spice but smothered in sauce -- just wasn't necessary ), ahi tuna dry, nachos were horrible -- drizzled with some cream and some ketchup tasting sauce ... I had scallops and most were ok except for one which was rubbery ( cooked too long ) ... I had it on top of cold cauliflower mash which tasted horrible.  The accompanying sauce also drowned the dish.  Just wasn't necessary.    Not returning."}
{"text":"Underrated! Food is always good and at a good price. Bar has a good selection and daily specials. Definitely recommend for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place....except for all the weird rules about happy hour, beer specials, and getting food to go.   I have been coming here now and then for about a year.  They have a decent selection of local craft beer on tap, so I like to stop by to see what's going on.  Marty, the bartender, is amazing. He has singlehandedly introduced me to several beers and I love to get his take on what's happening in the beer scene.   This most recent visit was a bit of a quagmire.  None of the craft beers were on special....unless you consider big beer a craft.  Now, the price of a craft is only $5, so that's a bonus and worth the price.    Their food items on Happy Hour don't necessarily match up with the items on the menu...challenge.    Ultimately I wanted to take a special to go and  I was all set to end the evening after splitting 7 beers with Compadres.  It didn't happen.  Apparently you can't take a happy hour special to go.  Big fail in my book. Just spent $5 each for a half dozen plus beer and got denied a bit of food....not good.  I'm guessing I could have ordered the food and had it brought over and then asked for a To Go box and been OK....but that seems shady.    I have now accepted that when you head here you can drink but you gotta have a plan for food afterwards if you want to eat elsewhere.  Kudos to the bar staff...negatives to the establishment for the rediculous rules that'll Make me think twice about bringing friends here for drinks, and some food to go."}
{"text":"City Tavern has certainly lost any direction it may have once had.  I remember their Steele Creek location for their excellent weekend brunch.  This location offers you half price Red Bull/Vodkas?  Been several times during the week and try to like it due to great location and menu, but am always disappointed.  The wait staff is always clueless about the current menu and specials (except for the drink specials).  The place is only ever about a 1/3 full and for good reason.  Excellent location, nice building space and layout, should be a basis for success right?  The one time we had a larger group and made a reservation, they couldn't find the reservation but mentioned it was fine since they aren't normally busy during the week and proceeded to seat us shortly after.  This place is not busy for a reason."}
{"text":"Great food.  Excellent service.  Almost always space to get seated, due to the size of the restaurant.  The weekly specials are awesome from half priced app Thursday to wine Wednesday...  I definitely recommend this location and the great staff that works there !"}
{"text":"Seated on a Tuesday night at 7 pm, we had no server acknowledge us, despite sitting for an inordinately long time.  No, \"I'll be with you folks in a moment,\"  no, \"Hi, I'll be right back to take your drink order,\" nothing.  Several servers walked past, but not a glance in our direction.  Good WiFi, though, so as we waited, and waited, and waited, I discovered many single star Yelp reviews.  Hmm...maybe not worth the wait.  I can't comment on the food, or even the drinks, as we didn't get the chance to order any.  Eventually, we cut our losses and returned our menus to the disinterested people at the host station."}
{"text":"Maybe I just got unlucky, but either way, my first experience here was NOT good.  I drive by often, and since they have a sign up that says \"Best steaks in S. Charlotte,\"  I thought I'd test them out.  It is a little funny that they only compare themselves with S. Charlotte as if they don't have confidence to broaden their competition.  In any case, the steak was average at best, probably a 5 out of 10.  I ordered the Ribeye, and it was about 25% fat and I really don't like to eat THAT much fat in a steak.  The potatoes seemed like they were microwaved because they were hard, almost stale.  The green beans were ok, maybe the only thing good about the food.  I sat at the bar and even though they must have noticed my cup being  empty, I sat a good 20 minutes with an empty glass before they grabbed the sweet tea and gave me a refill (took 5 seconds).  Sure I could have said something, but dang, two of them were standing right in front of me, so I was curious how long it would take to notice.  No manager asked how my meal was which I am accustomed to at all other similar joints at this price point.  If she/he had asked, I would have been forthcoming and said I rate my experience 4 out of 10 based on the food and service.  It's one thing to serve a crappy steak, but to say you have the best steak in S. Charlotte is just bogus.  Longhorn and Outback beat it 10 times over.  Lastly, I was disappointed that they did not give bread or anything while waiting for my meal.  Again, I'm accustomed to that with other restaurants I go to for a steak, although I admit this was my faulty expectation rather than something they did wrong.  I tend to frequent restaurants with free bread or chips since I'm often starving when I arrive.  Needless to say, unless they offer me a free meal or someone else invites and is paying, I will look elsewhere for a steak dinner.  It's definitely NOT the \"best steaks in S. Charlotte.\"  Sorry to tell you..."}
{"text":"This place is alright, it is a little upscale for my taste, but it isn't too much of a hurt on the wallet.  The bartenders are all nicely fitted in black, and the entire restaurant is clean as a whistle.  The crab cakes that I ordered were so tasty, and the waiter was pretty quick.  I thought that the bar service could use a little work, it took forever to get my check, and they weren't that busy.  Mostly older people hang out here, so the music is light rock.  That's alright, they played some beegees and that warmed me up a bit."}
{"text":"Second time to the City Tavern in Waxhaw...each time I have been very pleased with the results!  Last night we had great service from a Server named KIM..she watched every need we had. We ordered Appetizers and Salad. And even ordered a meal for Grandma off the Kids Meal We had the Kale and Apple Salad, with a Apple Citrus Vinegarette.. It was great!  We also had the  Quesidillas with Smoked Gouda..also really tasty. My sister is a Vegetarian and the did everything to help make sure she was taken care of! They also have a great local Craft Beer selection! Always nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"We went here over a year ago one night because it was local and the food was just ok but yesterday we decided to try it again and to my surprise it was much better than expected.   At first we came in around 4:20 pm and only a couple people were there and no one was there to seat us, at first I was planning on leaving but then a woman came out and directed us to a table.   We ordered the fried green tomatoes and Bangkok shrimp,  both were very good, the kids had grilled cheese and fries and chicken tenders that were very good in flavor and presentation.  We then had a Greek salad with grilled chicken and a shaved prime rib sandwich,  needless to say there were no leftovers to account for.   Not sure if it's under new management since the last time or just an off night a year ago but this place is fantastic.   I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes.  The service by Harley was very good as well, nothing but good things to say about the whole experience.   Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, Tiffany and Marty are both excellent behind the bar regardless of the size of the crowd, will defiantly go again"}
{"text":"I came into City-Tavern on May 8, 2011(Mother's Day) at about 4 something in the evening. There are two suggestions I can offer:   Plan better on busy events The customer is always right    I'd heard so many good things about City Tavern, so I finally came to give the place a try. We arrived with three guests waiting for one of our guest to join us. We didn't have to wait long to be seated. We sat down and the manager came to take our drink orders. We didn't wait much time on receiving our drinks at the table. The waiter we had told us about the all-you-can eat crab leg special, but did not take our order at that time. The waiter walked away not returning for 20-30 minutes(mins), my partner went to the hostess to let the hostess know we wanted to order. The manager of the restaurant came to the table to get our order. At that time we ordered an appetizer: Sea Bake and Entrees: two all-you-can eat crab legs, and a seafood Capellini with bow tie pasta. There were many guest that came in behind us not ordering all-you-can eat crab legs, but got their food before ours. We waited another 20-30 mins on just our appetizers. Finally, our fourth guest arrived stating \"Gosh you guys still don't have your food yet?\" The fourth person in our party had done the following before getting there:  Dropped her husband off at work in Pineville, NC, came home put on clothes, then came to the City Tavern. When our waiter came over we asked him what was taking so long for our food. The waiter stated \"that the restaurant was soooooo busy and the orders would take a little longer because we had the crab legs.\" I have been to many restaurants and seen busier! The waiter then took the fourth guest order, which was appetizer: hot wings, entree seafood capellini. We also requested for the manager who didn't make the situation anymore pleasant then the waiter did. \"The manager stated that the policy was they had to wait on the appetizer to get done so that it could come to the table first. They could not let the appetizer come before the food!\" I'm definitely a person that eats out often and I have never heard of this in my life. Before asking for the manager the waiter stated \"that I went to get the manager for you, she said the same thing I did.\" Clearly unprofessional when it comes to your buying customers. After the manager came we then received our food after waiting about 30 mins. Another 5-10 mins the fourth guest food comes to the table, both appetizer and entree. The waiter knew he did such a crappy job he went ahead and added 20% gratuity to the ticket. I would never go back to this restaurant again or even recommend anyone. For future each one of the workers that were discussed in this email should treat people how they would when they're dining! I was already feeling a bit down because this was the first year of Mother's Day with out my mom due to her death on last year."}
{"text":"Come here at least once or twice a week. Different types of specials every night. 1/2 price appetizers, wine night and many more. Casual place, easy to come to and great food make it my favorite!"}
{"text":"OK... it's a Sunday and business is light, very light. NFL games are being played on the TVs to bring people to the bar but, apparently,  a lot of people ignore this place. Let me explain some possibilities why.  1. The staff doesn't seem to work well together... I sat at the bar and could hear a lot of bitching between staff... wrong orders, people not doing their jobs, standing around... whatever. I can understand this happening if the place was busy but it was EMPTY!!!  2. The interior looks like it's ripe for a do-over... Come on, there are TUBED TVs and tiny flat panels that are poorly placed. TWO couples came in to watch an NFL game that was not being projected and left because the bartender couldn't find the game or, frankly, she seemed bothered that she had to pull herself off her job to make them happy... they LOST BUSINESS... COME ON!!!  3. My Bloody Mary was one of the worst drinks that I have ever had... the mix was terrible... how do you screw this drink up? How about some imagination?   THE GOOD NEWS: I would have given this place 2-stars but the food was pretty decent. While the kitchen screwed up an order for a couple next to me (ordered a panini and got  a BLT or something like that... LOL..) mine came out nicely... salmon/eggs Benedict... yummy but I'd have used better bread)...  All in all, I'd hesitate to come back... it's just too run down.... while I know that you can't eat ambiance it didn't even have that kind of ambiance that was cool or unique..."}
{"text":"I decided to try to this place with a girlfriend after purchasing a Groupon. Like other reviews, I wanted to like this place. Drinks and food came out quickly, which was great; however, the server was too aggressive. He came to our table asking if everything was okay (yes, another great thing), BUT it felt like he was stopping by our table every 2 minutes. When I was wanting to catch up with my friend, his presence felt like an annoying pest that wouldn't go away. The 2 stars go towards the prompt service in terms of getting our meal delivered quickly and for the mimosas being strong and delicious. I ordered chicken alfredo, which lacked flavor but made up in a pool of oil. Yuck. I wish I could say I'd come back, but I won't."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been in, and service hasn't improved. Very slow kitchen and poorly trained staff. Good is decent, but plan to wait... and wait."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I loved the Service! Are waiters name was Dakota \"like the state\" he was so Friendly and really seamed to care about the people not just a good tip. I've eaten here more the once and I always get the same thing because of how good it taste. I really feel at home here because it gives off a home felling vibe. Love the food and we come back many more times!"}
{"text":"Been here four or five times lunch is way better then dinner The servers at dinner is the reason I will not go back!! I love waiting twenty minutes to have somebody come to the table and then actually sit and watch my food sit and wait for the server 15 minutes to pick up the food Have better service in fast food"}
{"text":"The restaurant was so hot it miserable, and the staff said it was the normal temperature.  The dining room was dirty and no one appeared to be cleaning dirty tables, but the servers and hostesses did have time to stand around chatting.  Additionally, the servers appeared grungy, not neat or clean as one would expect from a mid priced restaurant.  There were four of us in our group and the appetizers and entrees were not good.  Two of us ordered the steak special that evening and neither of us could eat the steak because the it was well done, they were ordered medium rare, and the sides were very greasy.  The other two meals were not any better.   We will not go again."}
{"text":"It appears a little fancy when you walk in, but the food is reasonably priced and tastes awesome. The atmosphere was excellent, the waiter's know their menu and are extremely friendly. This is the type of place where the food is cooked by real chefs, not kitchen cooks. The Twin Tails meal was quite honestly the one of the best meals I've ever had. They quite frequently run a Groupon you have to jump on! If you haven't been here yet, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Charlotte location is closed for business.  I went there tonight without thinking to check their actual website to see what locations are open."}
{"text":"2nd time going. The restaurant is never really busy. The waitresses are friendly but don't pay attention to details. Each order we've had they've forgotten sugar, straws, drinks, to bring out soup, etc. The last time we went my husband had the meatloaf and I had the seafood bisque (flavorful with a kick) and beef tips 1/2 sandwich (bread roll was toasted and warm) combo. His was OK nothing to rave over but my meal was pretty good. The disappointment was with the appetizers. We ordered calamari, the portion is perfect for two people, not a huge portion. It was light, crispy and didn't taste rubbery. We barely got any sauce and had a lemon slice not a wedge so we couldn't pinch it to put lemon juice on it. We asked for another sauce and they forgot to bring it to us so we had to ask 2x times and the one we go was marina sauce and it was really hot as if it just came off the stove, our calamari wasn't warm at all. We also had spinach artichoke dip which was cold, the cheese wasn't even melted. It looked like it may have sat under the heat lamp for 10 minutes and then was served to us. They were super stingy with chips. Kids eat free on Sundays. My son had the chicken fingers with fries. The chicken was lightly battered and tasted good. The shoestring fries were so salty that we couldn't let him eat them. My iced tea initially came with lemon and what looked like a piece of onion skin. When I asked the waitress for a new glass of iced tea she argued with me that it was a piece of lemon, it clearly was not and I had to ask 2 more times for a new glass. I was turned off by her arguing with me on that issue and felt it should have just been replaced without saying. The atmosphere is OK, a bit dark in the booths. You can seat a large group comfortably. We did not have drinks but they do seem to have an ample bar with televisions to watch games."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here and take part in the happy hour.  We happened to be there the same time as a wedding party so they seemed a bit flustered and fairly busy at the door.  We sat at the bar and ordered a few whiskey sours and a rum and coke. The drinks were pretty good.  We later ordered blacken chicken and pasta.  The food was ok."}
{"text":"I am absolutely impressed with how all of the staff that we encountered were so friendly. We Where were acknowledged immediately and  didn't have a long wait. We also were serviced by several people that were not assigned as our waiter. Our drink glasses were never empty.  The salmon and shrimp were seasoned perfectly. The food was  five star quality and I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a dinner on Saturday night for our company. The service wasn't good at all. The food was horrible, someone had ordered a drink and received, clearly someone had taken a drink out of it. It had lipstick on the glass. The room was dark and cold. The serviced was horrible even the waitress wasn't good and customer friendly."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! French toast with potatoes and 4 strips of bacon!!! The $3 mimosa was awesome. Highly recommend this place. Fast service!"}
{"text":"Mixed thoughts.  The crab cake sandwich was very tasty, but the tomato wasn't ripe and the lettuce was paltry.  The garlic fries have good flavor but seemed like low quality frozen fries.   My wife got the hummus wrap.  A TON of hummus, but it overpowered the other flavors.  They did substitute veggies for fries for her for a more healthy option.  The sweet tea needs a but more ice to be just right.   Had a little fly problem as well."}
{"text":"Met a friend here yesterday for some drinks/apps.  Sat outside since it was so nice out. Started out with a bloody mary.  They were good and I'm assuming there was vodka in mine, although you could not taste it.  My friend got the calamari and I decided to splurge and get the Lobster Nachos.  The calarmari looked good but had no taste what so ever.  The nachos cost $14 and were approx 10 single chips with a small little bite of lobster and some sauce drizzled on it.  I'm not sure what I was expecting but for $14 I thought I'd get more then 10 small chips.  Guess I should have went for the all you can eat crablegs instead.  Service was good, our waitress checked on us often."}
{"text":"Great Bison Burgers!!  Nice patio outside. Brunch at City Tavern until 3 pm.  Filet Mignon Benedict and Bison Burger!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at City Tavern several times and had great experiences.  Not tonight.....the service was non-existent.   The excuse from the hostess was they had a party of 30 in a back room and the managers put most of the servers in there.    Why seat us in a section that has no server then?   The main dining room was three quarters empty.   Or the hostess could have taken a table to help out?     The food was the savior because it was as good as always....so that will likely bring us back for another try.      My other complaint about this restaurant is that I never see any management.   Why are they not visible?"}
{"text":"We were entirely unimpressed with our visit to City Tavern last weekend. There wasn't anything so shockingly terrible we wouldn't return but it will certainly be another couple years.  The first sign of a problem was despite coming around 6:30 on a Friday there were only a couple other customers there. We snagged a booth in the corner and reviewed the menu. The waiter talked about liquor and beer specials but did not mention the $4 wine special to us (he did to a later table that came in, so I switched my wine choice). They did not offer a liquor list when my fiancé asked what the options were only a list of rather generic low shelf options.   Then my fiancé asked about the oysters (the reason he picked this place) and the waiter said they only had them some nights. The huge banner outside indicated Friday was a night they served oysters so not sure if that's an only sometimes on the weekend policy or an ill-informed waiter. Anyway, when he came back the waiter confirmed they did have oysters for sale. Only by the dozen. Served with traditional cocktail sauce annnnnd drawn warmed butter. I am by no means an oyster aficionado but butter with raw oysters was definitely a first, and unpleasant, surprise. Especially since I was expecting a vinegar based sauce.  The complimentary bread that came after the oysters was delicious. My salad had dressing so thick I could hold my dressing cup upside down with no apparent inclination for the blue cheese to disperse onto the salad. My filet was not bad though it had a definite resemblance to a fast causal reheated steak. The potatoes were disappointing. The steam vegetables were served after the mains and while not bad didn't really leave an impact.   All said not a horrible terrible experience but certainly poor enough to wait another 2-3 years to return."}
{"text":"I like this place because they always have some great daily specials like 1/2 price bottles of wine during the week and $0.40 wings on Sunday's.  The wings are no where near the best I've had here in Charlotte but there decent.  They also have a seafood dip app that's pretty good to."}
{"text":"I tried calling during the day on a Saturday to see if they take reservations, but the phone rang and rang with no answer.  I mentioned it to the Manager that night and he said that it was known issue that had been going on since they opened, but they can't seem to get resolved. Then he offered to give me his cell phone number in case I wanted to call him directly next time. Really?!? That was just weird to me....and  my husband.  HAHA!    Anyway...the food was good, but way overpriced.  The service was overly friendly (I can tell you everything that you ever wanted to know about our waitresses high school successes).  The food was painfully slow coming out of the kitchen. It took nearly 45 minutes for our meals to arrive...good thing we mentioned that we had to be out by a certain time!    Was it terrible...no, not at all.  But, we really didn't love it either and for us to drop $100+ (before tip) for 4 people to have dinner (w/no alcohol), then we really need the atmosphere, service, and food delivery speed to be above par.    We had such high hopes for City Tavern in Waxhaw as we are still searching for a local go-to.  Unfortunately, I don't think this will be it."}
{"text":"The food was relatively good.  The service was a disaster.  The waitress (Melinda) forgot to bring us bread, it took her 15 minutes to get us beverages.  We waited 15 minutes to get the check and another 15 minutes to be able to pay.  It appeared like we were purposely ignored.  It was a terrible experience overall."}
{"text":"Loved my meal and had a fabulous time with our waitress!! We had a fun time with her. She took our jones with good spirit especially for it being later in the evening (we went around 830pm.....after a long day of shopping). Served our meals and drinks with a smile. She also offered advice about the meals and everything was spot on!!   I had the creole salmon and it was delicious!! It was served with a mushroom risotto and sautéed summer and zucchini squash. This place has a tavern feel with an upscale twist. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We got a to go order from here. The place is a little hidden and the parking lot can be confusing. We got our order without any issues. The hostess was very friendly and guided us where to go. Our food was already ready.   I got the blackened shrimp pasta and it was pretty good. The sauce was very thick and could possibly be from a can and not homemade. It was a big portion for a lunch size. My friend got the buffalo chicken wrap and she really liked it. She ordered garlic fries with it but she got regular fries. Fries were good, very skinny. A few people got the southwest wrap and they liked it. They also got garlic fries with their order but ended up getting just regular fries as well.  Overall, this place is ok."}
{"text":"Consistently bad food quality the place has potential great location good bar good scene but awful food. Everything I've ever ordered from here was not cooked right (under done/over done)"}
{"text":"I was just a little upset with City Tavern. There were not any healthy meals for a vegetarian besides a salad.   The restaurant looks very nice. It would be a nice place for a date night. That is the only reason why I would give it two stars.   However, it was very expensive!"}
{"text":"(my third visit) Food is good....a bit pricey, none is under $12 - FEW under $15, most are over $15. Even sandwiches ranges from $9 to $14 (I'll opt Red Robin over this). I've ordered seafood stuffed eggplant with lobster sauce on risotto. It's GOOD, but lacks a bit of \"kick\" - need spices. Overall, it's yum! Special nights - on drinks, appetizers - they're killers. You cannot beat their prices on those special nights. Have PLENTY of private space for private parties."}
{"text":"This is actually a 3-4 star restaurant... depending on what time you go. If you go unprepared (sans-coupons) at dinnertime, you WILL get screwed over by the outrageous prices that the regular menu features. I would go for the pasta, since the servings are more generous than pretty much anything else. Second choice would be the sandwiches.  With that said, I went at lunchtime and got a delicious filet mignon steak sandwich, which only costs about 9 or 10 bucks and came with delicious fries, sauteed mushrooms & onions, and melted provolone cheese that soaked up the rich steak reduction beautifully.   Well worth my money for lunch, especially since I had coupon that allowed for the second entree - for my best female friend Natasha - to be free so long as you order two drinks. Sweetwater IPA For. The. Win."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money.  They advertise in a local coupon magazine, which is why we came in for their Sunday \"All-You-Can-Eat\" Crab legs.    The crab legs were cold, tough, didn't come out of the shells easily.  The melted butter tasted like butter flavored oil, gross.  Came with mashed potatoes and veggies which were just Ok.  But we didn't complain, hey, you win some you lose some, right?  When we went to pay we offered them the coupon; $10 off $40 (on a bill that was $95 with tax).... and the girl came back and said we couldn't use the coupon on specials.  I then pointed out that the coupon didn't say that.  In fact, the coupon is printed next to the daily specials, implying a reason to visit.  She agreed the coupon didn't state it, said she'd try again.  No luck.  Her bar manager refused, so she sent over the general manager.  She also refused, she said it was the owners policy.  I'm really not a person to make a stink over a stupid $10.  But really, they are wrong.  Plain and simple.  They advertised something that is misleading.  And they don't know enough when to suck up their mistake for the sake of providing good service.  So we paid the bill, told the manager we wouldn't be back, pointed out that the owner would be good to notice that the place was empty at 8:00 on a Sunday night, and tipped the waitress generously.  And then we went to Culvers for ice cream, because we earned it!"}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day buffet and it was too expensive for the quality of the food served.  Runny scrambled eggs, dry noodles Alfredo with what was suppose to be chicken and shrimp.  Desserts were store bought mini muffins, cookies and fruit.  Very disappointed.   Staff didn't check if we needed refills we had to wave her down.  Sorry to say won't be going back."}
{"text":"Rude staff . Short on staff . Looked inexpensive with a ridiculous high price and a 91.5 sanitation rating . I'll let you decide. Never are and we left because  they wouldn't let us sit outside even though open tables were available outside and there was another table seated outside and being served."}
{"text":"I went to City Tavern this past Wednesday. I just went in to have a drink with my Wife and we had great service sitting in the bar area. I have been here several times and never had such good service. I suggest you go in on Wednesday and ask for Michelle. It won't be hard to find her as she is the one with the big smile and a laugh."}
{"text":"We had dinner here recently. The decor is a bit all over the place, it doesn't have any personality, no strong character. Same goes with the food we tried.  I got the Chicken Saltimbocca with prosciutto,spinach and mushrooms wrapped around chicken breast, with mashed potatoes and some bland sauteed vegetables. The dish was supposed to have some Madeira wine based sauce, but it tasted more like a regular gravy to me, which isn't a good thing. For the price they charge (over $15), I expected more sophistication. My husband got the Chicken Alfredo over bow tie pasta, once again, it was just OK, he wasn't a fan of the extra orange colored mystery cheese they added to the sauce, it made it too heavy. We got 2 glasses of their house red, which it was OK.  The service was a bit much, the waitress stopped too many times at our table, but somehow, she brought my husband's food later than everyone else in our party.  Monday nights they have half off their \"make it yourself burger\" deal, so it was getting crowded. I guess their burgers are decent.   Overall, OK place, bit pricey, just don't expect anything great."}
{"text":"Once was more than enough. Never again. I went with friends for a Friday evening meal. After being seated, it took forever to get a waitress to visit our table. After inquiring at the hostess stand about whether wait staff was assigned to our table, our server appeared and rudely asked what we wanted to drink. No greeting. No \"May I get you ladies something to drink?\" Later, it was impossible to get her to refill our drinks.   Ordering was another challenge. When we asked the server about getting pasta with meatballs, she didn't think it was possible. So my friend offered to order the meatball appetizer + plain pasta, so that she could mix it together for her daughter. Seems as if the kitchen could do that with no problem. The fish that was served was spoiled and left such a nasty after-taste in our friend's mouth that she couldn't even eat anything else. After it was sent back, the server informed us that we were right; she tasted the fish when she returned it to the kitchen!  Our server was very busy - with a table of people that were apparently her friends. She even sat down in the booth with them to socialize, even though the restaurant was (amazingly) busy and people were waiting to get a table.   At the end of our meal, we were told that the spoiled fish dish would be removed from our check, bringing the total to $44. When she presented the check, it was for $66. Upon closer examination, it became apparent that this was the check for our server's table of friends. She had already run our credit card through for this amount, and when asked her to show that the charge had been voided, we were first informed that this would have to wait until the end of the evening when the restaurant closed. Then she tried to convince us in a brusque manner that it had not been charged to my friend's account; the server even told her to check her bank account right then - at the table - to prove it. Very confrontational.   After paying the correct bill and leaving City Tavern - Waxhaw, my friend used her phone to check her bank account. Sure enough, she HAD been charged the $66 in addition to her $44. She called the restaurant and spoke with the manager, explaining that she was normally not one to complain, but this evening had been a fiasco at his restaurant. He promised to refund the incorrect charge and offered to comp her for the meal. Unfortunately, we could not recover a ruined evening.   Service and poor food like this can ruin a restaurant. Why this server continues to work here is a mystery. She is rude, inattentive, and obviously a detriment to City Tavern - Waxhaw. The town is steadily growing and has many other options within a 10 minute radius. It wouldn't surprise me to see an empty parking lot and a VACANT sign on the building in the near future.   Don't waste your time or money. Go somewhere where the food and the service will make your evening enjoyable."}
{"text":"Food was good but took over 30 minutes after ordering. I liked the pork chop and the Parmesan mashed potatoes. I have pictures for some of the items that were served. The atmosphere is nice but the service needs to match."}
{"text":"City Tavern is an attractive restaurant in the heart of uptown Charlotte. They boast a nice menu with a great seafood selection, so we gave it a shot. For starters, we went here on a Saturday night at 8pm and were practically the only ones inside, which is never a good sign. I ordered a mojito, which was really good and refreshing - one of my favorite parts of our experience there.   I ordered the seabass and it really wasn't anything spectacular. This is definitely one of those restaurants that gets the job done, it is clean and the food is OK, but I would probably wouldn't think to go here when looking for a good restaurant on a Saturday night. If you do head over, look for my second favorite part of our experience, our waiter. He was so cool and absolutely hysterical!! I can't remember his name, but look for the guy who looks like Dave Chappelle. You'll get dinner and a show."}
{"text":"We just moved to this area of Charlotte about 6 weeks ago. We've stopped by City Tavern at Rivergate before for a drink, but two nights ago, we decided to go in for a late dinner. The wait staff was superior; they were so very knowledgeable and described how our dinners would appear when they arrived. My boyfriend got the special, a ribeye steak and lobster tail with asparagus, and I got blackened seafood served over a bed of their potatoes. We also got a salad. We are pretty critical of food, but we couldn't remember when we'd eaten a more delicious, precisely cooked meal. I can't wait to have another superior dining experience at this restaurant. I'd highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for $20 and enjoyed splurging on an 8oz filet for lunch. It was amazing. The mushroom sauce for the mashed potatoes made it perfect and over the top. The bunt cake chocolate dessert was notably average and I'll have to try an different dessert however no points lost. It is a pricy place for what I ordered, but their lunch specials are very good value at rates that could compete with the average but subpar fast food joint. All in all, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch service as well as great food. I have been to this restaurant twice in the last month and have had great service and food both times. I am very impressed with both visits. I also like that they have a private dinning area for large groups and or get togethers, very good for my business in the area. Check out City Tavern in Tega Cay, you should not be disappointed."}
{"text":"up-scale bar food.  not my normal go-to; but, the staff is nice.  food always hot.  can get busy on weekends and around movie times.  apps good before a seeing a flick.    try the tempura asparagus."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, I really do. However, the last time I was in to pick up a to-go order, I was appalled. The bartender was 1. Rude, 2. Horrible, 3. Rude about my mention of her inability to keep up and nudge that she should ask for help. Food was really inconsistent the last few times - portions were cold and fried foods showed me they've not cleaned the friers in awhile..... Drinks took a long time to get to tables and my martini glass was super sticky. I'd advise an examination of staff and reevaluation of general processes. There's potential - and the east blvd location was always awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Suprisingly good food in a suprising location.  The menu has a little bit of everything.  I've been to this location before but rarely think of going here. The menu can be pricey but there are good values as well. I belive this location offers a Sunday Brunch and if so I ll definitely try it."}
{"text":"Server Brian M completely killed the night for me and my date. Food came before drinks....Brian disappeared in the back for 20 minutes then proceeded to pass our table full of empty glasses 3 times until I walked up to him and gave him my credit card. Thanks but no thanks. I was generous with the tip even though it was not earned. Cheers. On to another restaurant to continue the evening."}
{"text":"nice Thursday night crowd..acoustic set was AWESOME. not sure why the big radio station bus had to be parked right next to where we were sitting but aside from that the food was consistent (lobster nachos) compared to the location at StoneCrest and the waiter was on point."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat last Thursday and saw this place and it had some good reviews. So we decided to give it a go.  We walked in, and waited. And waited. And waited. After about 3 minutes (during which time my husband suggested we leave) a girl walking by said, I'll be with you in a minute.  So we waited...and waited...and waited. She finally came back, another 3-4 minutes later. The place was not packed by any means. There were a lot of free tables. I just chalked it up to her being new (maybe) and not knowing how to properly be a hostess.  We were seated and then our waitress showed up a few minutes later. We placed our drink orders, and received our drinks about 5-7 minutes later. We placed our order at that point.  Then we waited. And waited...and waited. We were sitting there for 40 minutes when our appetizers arrived. I got the caesar salad and my husband got wings. The caesar was very bland. There was barely any dressing on it. My husband said it was probably because I like so much dressing, but then he tried it and agreed it had no taste. The wings weren't bad, but the hot sauce was not very tasty at all. Then came our main course (by this point we had been at the restaurant for well over an hour). I had chicken in a sauce with parmesan potatoes. It looked really good. Unfortunately, it did not taste very good. My husband got the steak. Now let me just say that my husband LOVES steak. He has successfully finished off every single steak he's ever been served. He has complained about a few, but never in the 6 years I've known him, has he not finished a steak. Until now.  The quality of the steak was absolutely terrible. The steak was not properly seasoned at all. The chef did get one thing right...the steak was rare which my husband asked for. But he left over half of his steak.  Our waitress came over at one point to ask us how we were doing. We both looked at each other and said...ummm...ok.  Then we got the bill. It was over 100 dollars for 2 beer, 1 glass of wine, a small caesar salad, wings, steak and chicken.  This was hands down the worst meal and service I've had since moving to the Charlotte area. My husband said he would much rather head to the cedar street tavern in uptown charlotte. Our meal there was probably 1/3 of the price and the food was MUCH tastier. And the service is always incredible there.  I will never EVER go back to the City tavern. This place was such a joke. The food was terrible, the service was awful, and the prices were absolutely atrocious.  We ate at the Cantina thats across the parking lot from in last night, and had the BEST experience. Our waiter was absolute perfection. we had 3 beer, guacamole, with nacho chips and salsa, 3 tacos and a chimichanga for 57 dollars. And the food was a million times better. Our waiter at Cantina also received a 26% tip because he was so incredible.  Save your money and your palate, and do yourself a favour and DO NOT go to the City Tavern on Rea Road!!!"}
{"text":"Nice  sitting space . Food is not that great tastes just ok nothing that great. Tried hummus platter- hummus tasted really bad no taste at all. Panini sandwich was good .."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, this has been a favorite hangout of mine for years.  I know much of the staff and love them.  Maybe because I am a regular my comments are unnoticed?  The floor is FILTHY.  Has been for years.  The food has been consistently inconsistent and the wait staff are not professional cleaners, nor should they be expected to be; cleaning up after a shift is their job but never doing ANYTHING else to the space has created years of grime.  HIRE SOMEONE, to come in and DEEP CLEAN the bathrooms and dining room.  I personally know the kitchen is clean.  COMMERCIAL CARPET SQUARES HAVE A PURPOSE - to be replaced when they get crappy - they've been crappy for about 4 years.  Overall, the bar, dining room, etc. is just worn out and dirty.  The bathrooms have mop slosh stains on the tile walls that I have seen un-removed for more than a year.  I have never been to the SP or Ballantyne CT's because this one is close and has a group of great regulars - sort of a 'Cheers'.  But it has really been neglected of late and it shows.  Paint a wall, change out the ceiling tiles with stains from 2009 smokers, just a LITTLE bit would  make a difference.  This side of town is growing with many new spots coming in, to compete there has to be at least a minimum amount of revamping and money spent.  The concrete floor is stickier than a movie theater's... having a dishwasher slosh around dirty mop water in the a.m. isn't cutting it.  It needs to be SCRAPED, then cleaned, then re-stained.  Also, CT Rivergate has to be losing in the THOUSANDS on the keg system that has been messed up for YEARS - they have to pour out two or three glasses of foam for every beer they pull. Temperature? This is not staff's fault, but really, when is this going to be updated?  Love it, but would love to see it get the attention it needs and become a great place again. Thanks :)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I have always frequented this location to grab beers before a movie. Last night we decided to have dinner and the food tasted amazing. they bartender was quite prompt with the drink service.  Unfortunately my boyfriend noticed a rather large size roach crawling up the wall and aound one of the flat screens. when he notified the manager she shrugged it off and said ohh thats just a water bug. she seemed unfazed and when my boyfriend told the bartender he found it crawling through the wine/champane glasses. he picked it up with a rag and looked at it yeah that was a palmetto bug (large roach). He didn't pull down the glass to clean them he just left them as is. My boyfriend and I were so grossed out we promptly left."}
{"text":"Overall first impressions very nice.  Ordered egg roll apps.  Seriously;? 2 small egg rolls cut in half...very small portion...definitely not sharable...here for super bowl party... TVs need a tune up....spinach dip very good...meatballs not so much... Very dense."}
{"text":"Great food and selection. Second time here and never really busy in the restaurant area, but bar usually has a good crowd. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"My mom and I went here for dinner recently. Our waiter Luke was super friendly and the hostesses were great too. The food was delicious. We ate every single bite on our plates. I'm so glad that there is a City Tavern near us. I plan to come back soon and encourage others to try this place out soon."}
{"text":"I love the food here and it is the perfect place for date night or if you wish to dine out with your significant other. The staff is friendly and always willing serve you with a smile. I took my other half here for our anniversary and we had a blast. I would go back and tell others to come too."}
{"text":"One paticular manager at City Tavern seems to be more caught up in his personal life along with his cheap, entitled, two-dollar hooker of a girlfriend rather than a group of paying customers. Tried to spend NYE at this establishment, however a person from our group was forced out of the restaurant after simply making a 'hello, hows it going' conversation with a woman next to him (who was the manager of year's girlfriend). After the entire debacle, the manager's girlfriend admitted she was wrong for having our friend kicked out, however it seemed to be a slew of non-sense, MIDDLE SCHOOL, drama that was derived from this situation. Again, we were paying customers who fronted a cover to get into this establishment... and after the drama ended, two of the bartenders, who witnessed the entire situation, offered our entire group free beer for thier management's malice ( which was much appreciated but the damage had been done)... I've worked in the restaurant industry in the past and understand how customers can be, however this situation was completely instigated by the manager's personal issues and was completely unprofessional. I enjoyed spending time and money at this restaurant in the past but now I'd rather spend my money on a vending machine that sells stale $4 sandwiches. So many great restaurant in charlotte and I wouldn't waste your time on this drama-fest."}
{"text":"Came here with colleagues for dinner.  Half of the party ordered martinis while the other half shared a bottle of pinot noir from the relatively simple wine list.   Ordered a few appetizers which included lobster nachos, barbecue chicken chips, and calamari.  Perfect for sharing.  Service:  overall friendly, but our server needed a little more polish.  One of our party had a special request inquiry and rather than continuing to finish taking the rest of the table's drink orders, stopped to answer the question.  This resulted in a nearly 10 minute delay in getting everyone served at the table.    Food Quality:  very good.  The salads as entrees topped with item of your choice were a hit.  They looked great, tasted fabulous, and were nice portion sizes.  A number of us ordered from the Steaks, Chops and More section.  I ordered the mixed grill with more than a little al dente asparagus, filet (grilled perfectly), grilled pork loin (really done well), and  lamb chops (which were far too underdone for medium rare). I sent back the lamb chops because they were too rare, and the resulting chops were perfect.  Ambiance: good for groups or small tables.  Clean look with raised tables along the far wall.  On the back wall was a long bench on a raised platform.  The diners on the other side of the table sat in bar stools.  So if you're not paying attention, it is easy to forget to step down."}
{"text":"What a poor experience my girlfriends and I had at City Tavern-Rivergate tonight!  The food was well below average and the customer service was very poor.  We will never return to this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I tried City Tavern first time today and didn't have a good experience.  They don't seem to cook things to order.  Just wanted mayo lettuce tomato on a sandwich.  Got home and no mayo -- so it was a pretty dry sandwich.  Garlic French fries the hardest chewy fries I've ever had. Beef tips I asked well done but it came medium rare.   Desserts are serve in a small portion so $6 didn't seem worth it.  Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times (2 bar 1 patio) and all 3 times the food was good or great. The service was slow once but the steak dinner made up for it. I have noticed the bad reviews listed here are from Yelppers with few reviews and the good reviews are from more true Yelppers. I take that under consideration when evaluating in yelp (consider the source)"}
{"text":"Decor is pretty standard. Open rafters and exposed conduit meets rustic appeal but has art for sale. We were seated quickly and served quickly as well. Ordered the gourmet meatloaf with mashed cauliflower and sweet potato fries. Meatloaf was moist and delicious. Has turkey, beef, and buffalo and topped with a standard but delicious brown gravy. Mashed cauliflower was out of this world. I'll be back for that alone. Sweet potato fries were delicious and had a wonderful sweet tangy sauce I can't quite put my finger on taste wise but loved. Nice atmosphere and service was friendly. Bridget was a great server."}
{"text":"Seafood Mac n cheese was great. A little of spice was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time eating at this location tonight. Floors are very sticky and aren't being cleaned well. Fries were terrible and we had to ask for new ones. Grease tasted old. Meatloaf was mediocre. Will not be back, especially for the money."}
{"text":"City Tavern has really gone downhill. Our last few visits have gotten progressively worse - both with food and service. The icing on the cake is we even wrote to them to complain and they never even responded. Can we say mismanaged?!"}
{"text":"Walked in Saturday evening around 5:30pm and sat right down. Decided on the bar high tops as there were plenty, and great views of many tv with college football games on.  Saw the menu online earlier, ordered the filet mignon, parm potatoes and asparagus.  Prepared wonderfully just as pictured on website. Great presentation, ambiance nice, upscale tavern style.  Service was spot on, never waited a second for anything. Was out of the wine ordered, so they upgraded (same cost) Had two bottles.  Susan and Jen are Rockstars !  They even got the stain off my new white Harley shirt from the dipping oil !      Overall, the food was priced well, with good diverse selection enough to satisfy most cravings. Wine and beer selection plentiful.  And service was exceptional !      Thanks Again !          Rick"}
{"text":"City Tavern's food is inconsistent but when it is good, it is very good. For example sometimes their salsa is chunky, sometimes very blended. Sometimes the bun on sandwiches are burnt. Sometimes the fries are undercooked. Usually I know what to expect from a restaurant but I feel like there is always a risk when ordering here."}
{"text":"BEST FILET MIGNON EVER! Our server, Chelsea was wonderful, and our food was amazing. The blackened seafood trio was delicious. Seriously, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Things started out a little slow. I was invited to City Tavern to participate in a fellow belly dancer's birthday hafla or party.  I was very impressed with the generous sized room that they had reserved for us.  However, nobody came to take our drink orders, so another dancer and I went to the bar.  The bartender apologized regarding the lack of service to our group.  We placed our wine order and waited.  And waited some more.  I could have probably grown my own grapes during that time span.  Even the ringing up of the beverages took longer than anticipated. Back in our reserved room, a server finally came to take our food orders.  The food itself was good.  I had the Brie, smoked Gouda and grape quesadillas.  They came with sour cream (yum) and raspberry jam, which I left untouched because I don't fancy sweet condiments with savory food.  The quesadillas were unique.  The flavors of the Brie, Gouda and grapes made a tongue shimmying combination for this belly dancer.  The other guests appeared to enjoy their selections as well I was thrilled that we had plenty of room to dance; however, I noticed two wilting peace lililies badly in need of a drink.  The lack of attention to the plants mirrored the nonchalant service.  Care for your plants and your customers! Please note that although there was a lack of organization, the staff was friendly.  A gentleman asked how the evening was, and, really, it was nice.  Good food and a large space to perform!  Three stars this time, with a little belly dancer intuition that it will be even better upon our next return."}
{"text":"I was again disappointed by this place, I had hoped for changes by now. Every time I have been here there have been issues, (no bartender in sight, no one acknowledged us till we leave, where to sit us, no advertised special as in the paper, no idea where our party was, wrong food brought for table) This was no different a night, it took 19 minutes to get service and another 15 to get our wine. We won't be back anytime soon, we were too scared to order food."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance since it feels classy, but that's it. The food was.... just flat-out not good. I got their seafood cappellini and sadly it was cold. Definitely not fresh. My mom got their Filet mignon sandwich and that was just disastrous. The meat was tasteless and it was cold. Basically it was awful. The waiter was nice and professional but I think they need to hire a new cook or something since the business seems pretty good and it would be a waste if it run out of business due to the quality of foods."}
{"text":"Stopped n here on a Thursday night with a coworker.  Ribeye was excellent.  The night before I had been at 131 Main on Rea Road and also had a ribeye.  City Tavern's Ribeye was MUCH better.  Bread and dipping sauce was delicious.  Waitress seemed pretty good.  I was not sure which beer to have so she brought me a sample of two related types.  When she came back and I had made my decision, I had a fair amount left of the one I preferred and she took the glass.  I thought it was kind of funny though."}
{"text":"Ribeye horrible. Calamari rubber tires. We asked for the Ribeye to be cooked medium rare and it came Raw inside. We sent it back and then it came out well done. Calamari appetizer sent back twice. Chewy both times. Service was slow. Best thing about the meal was the bread."}
{"text":"While waiting for work to be done on our car at the nearby Best Buy, we wandered across to City Tavern to quench our thirst with a couple of beers. It was great that they had some locals on tap, including my favorite Captain Jack from OMB. We also shared an order of the lobster nachos, which were okay but not not as much quantity as I expected.  Quiet on a mid-week afternoon centered between lunch and dinner but the service in the bar area (several TV's tuned to sports channels) was good."}
{"text":"I have been to City Tavern a couple of times, and to be honest it is always hit or miss.  Sometimes the food is good and the service is slow, other times the food is bad and service is great.    It's a lot like my golf game in that I can't put together a perfect round."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves a large variety of entrees. The seafood was good, not great but good. Caesar salad was weak but passable. Excellent service! Comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff.  Fat Tire on tap, always a good sign.  Vital Statistics; 1/2 Price wine on Mondays. Good value on entree prices. You can eat well for $20.  Good price/value relationship"}
{"text":"This place is definitely hidden, even though it is directly next to South Park Mall. The ambiance is close to a finer restaurant even though the prices do not reflect the atmosphere. The BBQ nachos are exactly what a person is looking for; cheese, sour cream, BBQ sauce and chicken on each individual nacho. How much does it suck when you get a plate of nachos at your table only to realize that half of them are covered with the goodies. This place takes the extra effort to ensure full coverage.   On Tuesdays, City Tavern offers half price martinis with their full list of about 12-14 different options. This is the perfect opportunity for afternoon shoppers to get a delicious alcoholic beverage without breaking their wallet.   Furthermore, our waitress was both friendly and attentive. She even shared in a few laughs about the topic of conversation.  The only negatives to our visit was the pricey New City Salad (extra $ for grilled chicken), which was crisp, delicious and had a unique dressing flavor, but was not big enough to cover the $14 charge.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant for a well-priced drink and an appetizer for those South Park Shoppers."}
{"text":"Well worth the drive over to Waxhaw for a nice night out. Good food and friendly staff. Give it a try !"}
{"text":"We went in for lunch today. This was our second visit and I must say the first visit a while back went well.  We got there about 12 noon. Almost an hour later at 12:55 our burgers arrived and we had no choice but to ask for \" to go\" boxes.  The server was apologetic for the delay ( lost order ) and gave us a discount. I've got to say she was very nice. But at the end of the day.....we went there for lunch...sat an hour and didn't get served in time to eat lunch. We brought our burgers back to work, cut into them, and our burgers which we ordered \" medium well \" and \" well\" were rare - hardly cooked.   We won't go back.  One the positive side - we ate at the City Tavern in Waxhaw a couple weeks ago and it was great !"}
{"text":"I already made a more detailed review for the branch at Rivergate but I love the server here. Even the chef was very thoughtful. This branch is a bit dark but I like wall of glass.   I don't like that it's hidden behind buildings. A little hard to find but they were helpful in guiding me to their restaurant.   This branch doesn't have the same daily specials as Rivergate though."}
{"text":"I like going to this branch because it's very close to my Charlotte house and they have inexpensive quality dining/takeout. On Mondays, they offer 50% off their already cheap burgers. I like the fact that City Tavern has the same prices all day long.  Their menu doesen't offer anything you cant find elsewhere and their food wont amaze you. (they did have a seasonal machiano cheese cake that was amazing though) City Tavern can be eaten casually but if you're looking for great tasting food that will blow your mind, you'll have to resort to somewhere else.  The staff is a bit fake and they don't have a charming personality."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with City Tavern. The place looks very warn and the food was awful and the prices were outrageous."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch.  The place was pretty empty by 1pm and but 1:30 it looked like I was the only one left inside the restaurant.    The server was attentive and friendly.  The menu was a bit more upscale that what I would consider your average lunch menu....filet mignon on a lunch menu?  Anyway, that should tell you that the prices were a little higher than your normal lunch spot as well.    I selected a lunch combo...a greek salad and 1/2 a chicken philly sandwich.  The food was good.  The salad dressing was pretty good but I felt the price was a little high for what I got.     The service was what stood out here.  The service was quick but of course when you are the only customer in the restaurant I suppose it should be."}
{"text":"I absolutely love city tavern! Every time I go, I get the chicken alfredo. It is soooo good. It is a little on the spicy side but it makes the whole meal come together. My boyfriend always gets the lobster mac & cheese and always loves it. The cheese bread they give before your meal is also very good. My favorite waiter is Dakota. He is very nice and always jokes with us and makes us feel welcomed. They also give out great groupons!!"}
{"text":"Groupon is what brought me into the restaurant. We Came at lunch time. There was a advertised special of half off regular burgers. My husband ordered a bison burger which made our meal roughly 10 total including the cost of the groupon which isn't bad. Without the group on it would have been roughly 25. The taste was pretty good. I was surprised that the bison burger didn't have a gamey taste. Service was good. Our drinks were filled as soon as they were emptied. I know several people have stated as far as the price it was expensive. I would have to disagree in my opinion. 10 dollars for a burger is what you would pay for this type of restaurant. As far as the other entrees the prices were also average. We stated even without a groupon when we wanted something different we would come back. We do have two small children and this would not be a place we dined at with them. It was definitely a setting for adults."}
