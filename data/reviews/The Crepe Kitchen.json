{"text":"I never knew a crêpe could be so delicious.  I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Crêpe Kitchen and I can safely say that this single experience has moved the crêpe into my list of favourite breakfast items. I was a bit skeptical at first about the combination of sweet and savoury, but they really hit the nail on the head with their Good Morning crepe (2 eggs, bacon, maple syrup, cheddar cheese). Each bite had the perfect combination of ingredients, with no single component overpowering the others.  Aside from the food, this place provides the perfect ambience for a casual weekend brunch. I'll  definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant...Eduardo was helpful and friendly. They have a large selection. The prices are a bit higher as is expected of Oakville. The food arrived on time and was presented well. It was still hot and tasted fresh. They do however have limited seating and only serve crepes, croque Monsieur, croque Madame, and soups. A very limited menu but if you want some nice crepes, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"A great selection of savoury and sweet crepes.  I had the dulce de leche with strawberries.  Amazing.  Great texture on the crepe, with an absoloutely delicious filling.  A tad on the pricy side, seating is somewhat limited, and they do close early.  So go for breakfast or lunch only."}
{"text":"A quaint atmosphere, friendly service. We had a savoury and a sweet crepe.  Both were delicious and quite large, very filling."}
{"text":"This place is trying way too hard to be pretentious. The owner served me and he came across as smug and was pretty awkward to be around. Regardless, the crepe still sucked; it was thin and flavourless and I would equate it to eating oxygen."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and starchy crepes. The owner should rethink his career in hospitality until he learns the meaning of the word."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We came here as a goodbye breakfast for our friends moving out west.  From the moment the 6 of us walked in, it felt like we were a nuisance.  3 of us requested a modification to the crepe for dietary/allergy reasons and we received eye rolls from the man behind the cash and the cook.  They told me \"it's too much work\" and it's \"not on the menu\".  Simply, I will never return.  Their attitude (except a young, female server - who was delightful and very helpful) was sour."}
{"text":"Fantastic crepes, whether for breakfast, lunch or dessert. Great French press coffee. Cute and clean, if a little small."}
{"text":"Overall 4 stars! Loved the crepe and salad. I had the Cheesy Pesto crepe which was tasty. Didn't like that the drink glasses were cloudy, so we questioned how clean they were. A little bit crowded but that was understandable because there was an event going on. The service was great and everyone was really nice! The crepes were a little bit pricey, but the portions were large. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years. We love the crepes, they are delicious and worth the money. Such a large variety. Cappuccinos are delicious as well. The atmosphere is great - love the French cafe style and antique furniture. The owners are great people, very welcoming and you can tell they love their business - we see them there every Sunday. We love this place so much we came here on our wedding day with my wedding dress and all - the owners welcomed us warmly. We now come here with our baby and the owners love having us. The servers are prompt, polite and take care of you well. This is a great place to go if you're in the area!! We are regulars and will be coming here for years to come :-)"}
{"text":"Same old, same old with this place. An obnoxious owner, tables too close together, and way too loud to have a normal conversation. Nothing seems to change at this place. I have no idea how they're still in business because Oakville has a ton of great restaurants that provide welcoming service with good food."}
{"text":"It is too bad that the owner and staff were so rude and out right mean, because the crepes are good. We walked in with a group of mom's for a birthday breakfast on a Tuesday, only to be immediately insulted. We were told to 'be quiet', 'move out of the way', move a birthday cake we brought off of the table (regardless of us understanding outside cake isnt allowed), the owner even removed glasses of water from in front of us, to get us out and argued with us. We all ate and drank and spent money. This is a restaurant but we felt as if we were in a library. He would huff and puff and told us to SHHHH. Other guests were speaking and laughing as well but it appeared our particular business was not wanted. So, none of us will be back again."}
{"text":"My friend and I were deciding where to eat and chose this place. We were getting together for breakfast. When we arrived the charm of the place hit me instantly. It was so cute.  I felt like we just stepped into a little shop in Europe. The owners were working the place and the guy took our order. We decided to split a savory and sweet crepe as we couldn't decide which sounded better and he offered to wait to serve the sweet later so it would be fresh when we were ready to eat it. We sat and he was very attentive. Kept our waters full and kept our silverware fresh. When our food came I thought I died and went to heaven. We split a caprese crepe with prosciutto. OMG!!! So so good. When we were finished he brought out our sweet crepe. It was Nutella, banana, and strawberry. It was a bit too sweet for me but I think a lot of things are too sweet. It was still really good and the actual crepe was the perfect texture. Light, airy, not gummy.   It was so good that the next day I took my husband and his brother and girlfriend for breakfast. We all loved it! We did the same thing and each couple split a savory and sweet crepe. My husband and I shared the caprese (again- that good!), and the French crepe which is lemon juice and sugar in the crepe.  My brother in-law and his girlfriend had the farmers crepe and apple, custard, and cinnamon crepe.  The farmers was so good! I will be getting that next time! The apple crepe tasted just like an apple pie. The lemon crepe though in my opinion was perfection.  Perfectly sweet and tart inside that beautiful dough.  It was again the owners working the place and they were so charming and attentive to what we needed and asked for. We will be frequenting this place definitely. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really homey-country vibe, perfect for what you might look for in a breakfast joint. You stand to order, and the food is brought in fairly good time. You can see all the happenings straight behind the counter, as the staff deliver their crepe creations...  We all ordered different crepes, the simple Ham and Cheese, the Chorizo sausage, and the Mushroom Three Cheeses.  If you're into flavour and spice, go for the Chorizo. If you like simple, humble, go for Ham and Cheese. The Mushroom Three Cheese is for those who LOVE cheese, and of course, love the subtle flavours of mushrooms. Overall, good crepe place, and they offer hot sauce oh yeah."}
{"text":"To be able to give this restaurant a thorough fair in my review, I decided to make my presence there 3 times although the first time didn't go very well for me. So, here it goes:  - When you come into the restaurant, you have to make your order first, paid and then choose your table to sit. The handwritten chalkboard menu is right on the wall next to the cash register and also on a pathway of the front kitchen. I find it a bit awkward, as a first time customer, who needs a bit of extra time to learn through the menu, because you feel you're in the way of other customers who are making their order and you're in the way of the server who enter and exit the same path. My recommendation is the restaurant owner should move the chalkboard menu somewhere else away from the front kitchen entrance way and the cash register.  - The food: the crepe batter itself is on average, acceptable but not special enough (not light and too much butter). The savoury crepe is not at all good. There are too much flavours go into the crepe. After eating, I'll find it very heavily sit in the stomach. The sweet crepe is better since it's simple and straightforward although I find it on a sweet side. - The price is right for the area but it's higher than the quality of the crepes they offer. - Decor and Cleanliness: Decor is great, bright and right for a french restaurant theme. The washroom is also clean and bright. However, they need to wipe the the table better after the guest leaves because I find the table matt often is sticky. Sometimes there is food still stuck on the table or table matt. - Customer service is needed fixed the most in my opinion. A very long wait for the food to come and if you come in with a hungry kid, the world will end for you. The male owner is never happy; rather grumpy most of the time. He has major (french) attitude toward his customers. As mention above, I find the sweet crepe is on the sweet side so I asked him, when placing my order, not to add the icing sugar on my crepe and he rolls his eyes at me every time with a long inhale and exhale under his breath.   Overall: not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Customers should be treated and respected well for them to return. Simple is that."}
{"text":"Bad bad service. The senior staff was very rude to the little girl. We understand the customers have to order before taking the table. But you don't need to be so rude to ask a 6 year old to leave the table in such manner. So bad!"}
{"text":"My daughter loves the chicken, hearts of Palm, mushroom and Béchamel sauce crepe!  It's a must do when we are in Oakville!  The dressing on the salad is great and we often buy a bottle for home (only way to get her to eat salad).  You place your order at the cash and u get a number to take to your table.  The owner will usually direct you to the smallest table to meet your requirements (so you can't always sit where you'd like).  But, you've got to understand that really as they want to seat as many as possible.  Good flow of customers.  I'm only rating 3 stars as I like a consistent and pleasing atmosphere!  The only issue is that sometimes the mood in the kitchen can affect your time spent.  Not a consistently happy atmosphere.    I brought someone from the UK to treat them to lunch after raving about it and they stated they wouldn't go again due to the atmospheric pressure!  But the food is consistent and the restaurant is quaint and clean!"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter if you pick savoury or sweet - you'll be getting a great crepe. On this lunchtime time with the kids, we had the breakfast burrito, the philly cheese steak, Charlie's choice and for a little sweetness, the Nutella banana crepe with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  My kids actually cleaned their plates, which almost never happens. I had the French press coffee which was delicious and my son had their hot chocolate which he really enjoyed.  The staff is friendly, helpful and quick. Our crepes were brought out piping hot full of delicious ingredients. My one and only gripe about The Crepe Kitchen is that it's pretty steeply priced for a casual lunch place and the serving you got is comparatively small. But I guess that's the price of a great location near the lake in downtown Oakville."}
{"text":"Great experience. We are visiting from Los Angeles. I ordered the \"good morning\" and my husband ordered \"farmer's pick.\" They were both delicious and served with REAL maple syrup from Quebec on the side. Crepes also come with small side salad on the side. My first bite was mouth watering. Service was impeccable, staff get friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place was a little more expensive than I was expecting to be but you can see why when you get your dish. It was very well made and tasted great. However it was quite squished with waitresses bumping elbows everytime they passed and it was too loud to have a conversation with the person next to me. Would be great to go at an unpopular time though."}
{"text":"Ordered the Pop-Eye (savoury crepe stuffed with spinach, eggs, mozzarella and Mornay sauce) and loved it. However, service was very slow.  Had to wait a good 10 minutes just to be given water! I can understand taking time for food or coffee, but water should come almost immediately - especially when you order your food and pay beforehand!  ETA: I got the sense that they serve tables in the order they're seated - including giving clients water!"}
{"text":"Warning, not kid friendy. We had a very bad experience and will never go again. My 3 year old son committed a couple of minor infractions  while we waited for our food which would have been overlooked at any other restaurant but the uptight and unfriendly owner lost his cool.  We got a refund and never got to try the the food. Stear clear of this place if you have children."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Feels like you're in France. It's truly a fine dining cafe experience. Family-run business serving old-world, high quality food. My daughter and I try to go every week. She gets a Nutella crepe with a whipped cream heart on top and I go for the AMAZING French onion soup and side salad. YUM!"}
{"text":"Crepes were good but service wasn't. They need to turn their AC on or at least make sure its at a comfortable temperature. We felt so rushed to eat and leave. Owner cleared off our table before I even finished my drink although I told him 2 mins earlier that I'm not finished. I've never been looked forward to leave a restaurant."}
{"text":"I live in North Carolina and visit Canada at least 3 times a year - on my last visit I tried The Crepe Kitchen and it was outstanding...the atmosphere is quaint and warm, the service was great but none of that matters if the food isn't - I had the Mediterranean Crepe and it was excellent - also loved the french press coffee! I will be visiting every time I am in the area! Lisa"}
{"text":"This place is the best place to grab a crepe breakfast any time during the week. It has a small family run feel and it seats less than 20 people at time. It does get packed very quickly and you'll be waiting for a table for a long time! But never the less it is worth it!   You place your order at the front and they bring the food to you. The crepe comes with a Honey Mustard Salad dressing is made in house and it is delicious! They sell it by the bottle but it never last in my house. My favorite crepe has to be the spanish, its got fiery chorizo sausage and cheddar cheese what's not to love?  If you're in the neighbourhood, come check this place out! but be warned it fills up very quickly."}
{"text":"Yes it's small and yes it can get a bit noisy and if you are looking for quiet then you should probably stay home and make yourself some food. I love this quaint little restaurant and the food is always amazing and the French press coffee is a nice touch and adds to the atmosphere. I have never had any issues with service and I think a lot of people expect to much from people just trying to do a job and serve you great food, they think just because they bought food from them they can treat them badly and not have them respond, I wish I could go to some people's work and treat them as badly as they treat their servers."}
{"text":"great delicious crepes!!!  BUT.... oh there are BUTs.  WAY too expensive for what you get.  I understand you have to charge a lot for the location, but give me more food on the plate to make what I am paying worth it.  The owner is super rude.  The atmosphere is just not friendly.   I don't need a waitress who annoys me to death asking if I am happy, but I don't want some dude who is just the opposite of minimum friendly.  Good food, too expensive, and not a great environment....   I don't know if I would go back."}
{"text":"Expensive....I am not going there again, my wife, my daughter and I spent  like $70 on breakfast. ..Good quality....but expensive"}
{"text":"Go. Go now. This is crepe heaven. Exceptional menu that contradicts the notion that a long menu is a detraction. This family run gem has it all figured out and they do it really, really well. Here the long menu just means you need to come back more often.  They certain don't drop the ball when it comes to coffee either! A crepe and a coffee here will change your life. See you there....if you know what's good for you."}
{"text":"Gotta be the worst service you can pay for in the service industry.  Bad attitude, very unfriendly management.  The food was decent and the decor was nice, but the experience just puts you off so much that its hard to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Decent crepe's but the owner is downright rude. We sat outside for a moment and told my friend to leave the seat. We still went in but there seemed to be a non-friendly customer atmosphere. They would be way better off with someone seating people properly and courteously. Food is ok bit would not go back because of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best service, great food, follow this review for an epic experience!  Eduardo and Ana are a dynamic duo. Whenever my girlfriend and I visit Oakville (coming from the states), the first stop we make is to The Crepe Kitchen.  Love is the ingredient to every recipe...."}
{"text":"My favourite place for yummy crêpes, French onion soup, and delicious house dressing (best dressing!!)   The couple is super nice and friendly.  My go-to crêpe is the \"Very French\" which is lemon with strawberries :) The mushroom crêpe is great for savoury. Tastes very authentic and the atmosphere is cute and rustic.   I always come here with my family and will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Cute little cafe hidden off Lakeshore with probably around 10 small tables. Enjoyed my chicken pesto savory crepe. Just didn't like slowly getting kicked out. If you're looking for a little coffee shop to catch up with an old friend for a few hours, don't go here during busy times like lunch hour."}
