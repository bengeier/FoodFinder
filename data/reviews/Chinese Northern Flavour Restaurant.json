{"text":"The experience here really depends on what you order and if you like northern Chinese cuisine. They are good on food with strong spices. I recommend the cumin lamb, double cooked pork and this crispy chicken bites (not sure what it's called in English). And you can't go wrong with the kebobs.

Side notes: $6 beer pitchers, might be a bit watered down but still a decent deal and goes really well with the spice-full food :-)"}
{"text":"Thought we'd try out this restaurant as it had received a 5 star rating.  However, the lamb and beef kebabs were quite salty and the fish hotpot tasted like the same seasoning they used for the kebabs.  The shredded jelly fish with the sliced cucumbers were too thick for my taste and the whole dinner did not come up to our expectation."}
{"text":"This place was great. Some staff don't really speak much English but the food is worth the communication struggle. The jellyfish salad was awesome and the cumin lamb delicious!! Their dumplings were also tasty. I was really really satisfied with the food, it was seriously some of the best Asian food I've ever had.

I was apprehensive about trying this place but Rol San across the street was closed and I was hungry. I'm really happy I tried this place because I'm now a regular. 

Also, I went with a few Asian friends from various places in Northern China and they all assured me that the food was authentic and tasted homemade."}
