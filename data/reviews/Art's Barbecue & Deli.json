{"text":"THE WORST BREAKFAST EVER!!!!!! Dry and chunky grits!!!!  Powder eggs or what looks and taste like powder eggs.  If I did not work so far away; I would had taking it back.  I could pick up the grits with a fork!!!!!   WASTE OF MY MONEY!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had anything here other than the chopped pork barbecue.  Art's will not make anyone's list of the top twelve barbecue joints in North Carolina, but I have yet to find any place in uptown Charlotte that can match Art's barbecue.  You place your order at the counter and they bring your food to your table.  The dining area is tiny and the seats are close together.  Don't go here for the ambiance.  But the 'cue is good."}
{"text":"We love Art's! It's right down the street from our office and we regularly frequent this diner for lunch. Not sure why so many people have to take to online forums to slam businesses these days. This place is consistent, friendly, fast and delicious! Keep it up Danny & crew!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and very friendly service and food. This place has a good long history with the area and dedicated customers. Breakfast is good and lunch is also."}
{"text":"I love Art's. I live nearby and it's a friendly little place with simple, inexpensive food and great service. The owner is very altruistic as well, which adds to my love of the place. They've been around for years and are very popular with the lunch crowds and with locals in Dilworth. If you want fancy food, head elsewhere, this hits the comfort food spot every time. Yum!  Oh and their burgers are good too!"}
{"text":"The only way this guy can stay in business are first time customers there can't be repeat.  They did not have relish for a cold hot dog and the mustard was actually sicking.  My wife ordered a pulled pork BQ and got beef being in a hurry she kept it  took one bite.  I tossed a regular hamburger, hotdog and BQ.  Later locals laughed at us being suckered in."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast. Quick, nice portion size, good quality. Home fries made to order, good wheat toast not made with crappy bread. Very clean too. Not crazy about styrofoam plates & cups."}
{"text":"First time visit. Fast take out service. Order, wait a few minutes, BOOM, food. The Good: Chopped pork was delicious.  Corn bread was tasty Baked beans were awesome!  The Not So Good: Potato salad was meh. Eggs and a little too much mustard or whatever they used. Roll seems to be generic store bought, out of the package roll.  Pecan pie....I believe it's frozen from a store? The crust had that \"I've been defrosted\" taste.  I'll go again but skip the pie and switch up a side. Funny thing the guy behind the counter said something to the effect of liking them on Facebook because they can't control what people say on Yelp."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Period. I don't know about everybody else but when I get barbecue I expect to have SOME kind of smoke flavor in my meat! The flavorless meat drowned in sauce is not acceptable for any real barbecue lover. And thats exactly what they served up to me. The sliced pork has NO FLAVOR at all... I felt like I was robbed. For any one looking for authentic b b que... save your money, ..and your tastebuds!"}
{"text":"This is a place that you WANT to like. Great location. Long history in Charlotte. And there's really a dearth of good breakfast diners in the area. But it just fails to deliver too often.   Today I was the only person in the diner when I walked in, ordered a bacon, egg & cheese sandwich ... and twenty full minutes later, nothing. I finally ran out of time and had to go. I asked for my money back, and honestly wasn't all that upset about it. The manager explained he had a big telephone order (not sure why that takes priority over someone who drove in and waited) ... but still, whatever.   But when I got my money back and put some of it in the tip jar as a \"thanks for understanding,\" the manager barked that \"that's [the hostess'] money, I don't get any of that, and it was my food.\" To be honest, that sealed the deal for me.   The food just doesn't measure up to that kind of poor customer service. The place runs like its on borrowed time and just coasting to the finish...which is a sad spot for what should be a really awesome retro piece of Charlotte."}
{"text":"Maybe my standards are too high. I had high hopes for the breakfast biscuits here, based on various reviews online, but in the end they taste like frozen biscuits with various toppings. I had a chicken biscuit, and the boyfriend had egg and bacon. Both biscuits had that sweet, frozen/refrigerated/pre-made biscuit taste, rather than a true buttermilk biscuit taste. If I'm getting chicken / bacon / other savory items on my biscuit, I don't want the biscuit to be sweet! We also got potatoes, which were good, but they were nothing particularly special. In the end, I can make a better biscuit, and even the biscuit sandwiches from Bojangles are probably better than these (gasp).   I want to go back to Art's for lunch soon, because I really, truly loved the atmosphere in there. The staff were amazingly nice, it's a cute little place, my order was ready quickly, and I like to support local business. But the biscuits just don't cut it for me to try them again."}
{"text":"I eat here every week at least once. The food is good and service is always top notch. Of all the lunch spots this one has the most regulars. The BBQ is unique and I love it.  I had them cater a party and all the guests were raving about it. It's a big menu and I really only eat a couple things but the daily specials are all really good."}
{"text":"Just visiting the area.  Stopped in for some barbecue.  Good food. Friendly staff. Good price. Look the BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast biscuits in town! This place is a Charlotte staple! Also try the party pack for larger catering needs, Danny the owner is world class he will take great care of you! The folks here take a lot of pride in giving great service and quality food! Eat here once and you will be back!"}
{"text":"Service was fast. Tea is good. French fries are good. Bbq - not so good. Will try something else to see if I change my opinion."}
{"text":"Had Thursday's fried chicken special.  Delicious.  Fresh. Hot. Crispy.  Flavorful.  Had option of 12 sides and drink.  I had 1/4 dark meat, mac & cheese, small salad,  corn muffin, and drink. \"Chicken done right!\"  Price a good value. Mac & cheese, meh."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of watered down vinegar sauce with a few specs of tomato at all.  I gave it two-stars just not to be a jerk, but I tell everyone not to go here."}
{"text":"This is a good little place to get a cheap, greasy meal.  Art's is open for lunch and breakfast (they open really early and close around 2).  This place is small and can be crowded, and it is very informal.  I don't know much about the lunch foods, but the breakfast is pretty good."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast! Pancakes are huge and very flavorful. Amazing biscuits and hash browns - we were a party of 7 and everything was perfect! Staff is so friendly and fun! It will be my regular stop next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I came here twice in one day, so I've got a lot to say.  Let me sum it up for you before I dive in -- AWESOME breakfast, HUGE lunch, FRIENDLY staff.  ---  I curiously popped in for breakfast one morning, since I had gotten to work a bit early, and it's conveniently within walking distance.  When I walked in, I was greeted with two things:  a friendly smile, and a massive menu.  I ended up going with a classic -- bacon egg and cheese biscuit.  It looks a lot smaller than it actually is, because it filled me up, to my surprise.  And it was delicious.  Super flavorful, everything you could want in a hearty breakfast sandwich.  I liked it so much that I told my friend about it, and we went a couple hours later for lunch.  Lucky for me, they had the Thursday special -- Fried chicken, bread, and two sides.  The server kept suggesting it, so how could I say no???  My friend got a cheeseburger.  They bring the plate out, and it's the biggest helping of food I'd had in a while.  MASSIVE chicken breast.  Served with not one, but TWO scoops of mashed potatoes and gravy, and mac & cheese.  Hush puppies were a bread item.    Pure.  Southern.  Bliss.  My friend's cheeseburger was 10 oz.  Gigantic too.  You get a serious bang for your buck here.  I really enjoyed the sides, and the fried chicken was good, but I felt that it could've been more flavorful.  Kinda overhyped, at least for me.  But hey, everything else was excellent!  One more thing to note, they've got Panthers memorabilia hanging around the store.  Autographs from literally every big Panther.  It's a nice touch.  Overall, a pretty cool place.  I've gotta try their BBQ next time."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but considering I had not eaten here up to very recently in the almost 10 years I've worked within a block I must say I was a tad disappointed.  Think I'll try again to see if maybe I just came on an off day."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. The server, while a bit harried, was charming, friendly and helpful. The food was totally fine. In fact, the biscuit was pretty good. I'm a non-Southerner, so maybe the biscuits aren't spectacular, but I liked mine. Price is right, and service was quick. Don't hesitate to go, but don't expect more than decent diner fare. That way, your expectations will be met or, dare I say, surpassed."}
{"text":"Why mornings always has to be hectic?! Whether I'm trying to make it to work on time, or to start an early shopping day -- or even on the very rare occasion, when I'm striving to make it to take a board exam in my new city, in the morning. Early in the morning. Sigh! Well, hectic or not, no one has to skip the most important meal of the day. Breakfast- of course! My exam was scheduled at (AMP) assessment center inside H&R Block Office. I woke up early enough to eat breakfast. Art's Barbecue & Deli was literally next door to the assessment center, which was very convenient. The lady behind the counter, who took my order of Cheese Omelette, was super sweet.   Facts: - Open  Mon- Fri 7am-3am and Sat 7am-2am. - Full Breakfast and Lunch. Please note that Breakfast is served till 11am and till noon on Sat.  - Even though Art's has been around since 1976, they accept credit and debit cards in addition to cash. - Art's daily lunch specials is served with two side of your choice of: (green beans, baked beans, potato salad, cole slaw, mac & cheese, hush puppies, mashed potatoes, french fries, side salad, or applesauce)  Monday: 1/4 BBQ chicken Plate $5.95 or White meat $6.95 Tuesday: Chopped Sirloin Steak Plate with grilled onions & gravy $6.95 Wednesday: Grilled Chicken tenders on rice with gravy $6.95 Thursday: Art's Southern Fried Chicken Plate $5.95 White meat $6.95 Friday: Fillet of Perch plate with tartar sauce $6.95 Saturday: Art's Hamburger Deluxe with lettuce, tomato, mayo, french fries and no other sides. $5.95  They only took a matter of few minutes to make my Cheese omelette and it was decent. Did I mention Art's also close from where I live. So, I will be be visiting whenever I'm starving and lazy, and that happens a lot.   Three and Three Quarters Yelps"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick breakfast and ordered the Breakfast Special.  Lots of food for a small price.  Everything was fresh and very tasty.  I will definitely return.  Maybe for lunch.  Also very friendly staff."}
{"text":"If you just need a quick diner fix during the day or your quiet breakfast nook for some home-cooked fare or if you need to eat to feel better after paying your taxes at H & R Block, you're in the right place.    The owner is so nice (after he almost backs over you)!  Seriously, he apologized, but sadly no free breakfast for me that morning :)    It's clean, the staff are friendly, there's usually a paper you can snag part of & it's quiet..ahhh, silence beckons me away from the normal breakfast crowds."}
{"text":"I've actually never had Art's barbecue (though I love that they spell \"barbecue\" with a \"c\" - a man after my own heart).  I've only been here for breakfast.  I realize these days that your breakfast fare is generally split into two categories - fast food, that you can put onto bread of some kind and then the sort that you put on a plate.  Of course you have some leeway in there, but that will generally cover it.  Art's, naturally, falls into the latter category, offering eggs and meat plates of various styles, and will typically pack in the parking lot.  You simply order at the counter and a few minutes later you are all set with a plate of piping hot breakfast, ready-to-go!  Service is friendly to boot!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is a 4, lunch a 2 so....math.... a 3. The people are very nice. I've tried 10 different things at lunch because some coworkers like to go there with no luck. I need to just order breakfast when I go because there you can't go wrong with any of the egg choices."}
{"text":"Fried Chicken Thurday Special, need I say more? So delicious! I'm born and raised in Charlotte and for me to say it's the best fried chicken I've ever had is a statement. $7 plus change for a fried chicken and 2 sides (mac n cheese and green beans are my favs)? You have my heart. I've gotten the BBQ here before too but honestly, I only come here on Thurdays before preschool pick up that's right next door. The BBQ is decent and doesn't taste too fatty which I enjoy and it's a great price. The cashiers are super friendly and gorgeous. I need them to give me make up tips. How have I been in Charlotte my whole life and just discovered this gem?"}
{"text":"Diner style breakfast. Good selection of breakfast choices. All cooked very well. The pancakes are crazy huge!  What really makes this place is the owner Randy. Great personality, really cares about his business and your happiness. Something lost in today's society. Have not tried the BBQ at lunch"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I stopped in for lunch and ordered the chopped pork sandwich with baked beans.  I really liked the beans. The sandwich was good. The meat was cooked well and the sauce gives it a tanginess that goes well with the pork. I really liked the mom and pop vibe of this place. It has a strong history and has been around for decades. The staff was friendly and I was able to get in and out fairly quickly during their lunch rush."}
{"text":"I've only been here for breakfast so far but my experience has been great- the staff is super friendly, the atmosphere is charming and the food is consistent and tasty. I definitely recommend a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit- their biscuits are so buttery and yummy. This is the perfect place to grab a quick breakfast on the go and it has a great low key and fun vibe."}
