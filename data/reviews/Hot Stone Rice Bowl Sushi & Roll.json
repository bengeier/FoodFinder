{"text":"Never had a bad experience here for the past 2 years I've been coming here.The staff is friendly and a nice small restaurant to have lunch or dinner.  You get a free salad to begin with. The sashimi is fresh and portions are good for the price you pay. Definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for decent sashimi for a good price considering Calgary has a high mark up for anything seafood."}
{"text":"I used to live right down the street. Had takeout one time. Never again. I had the teriyaki chicken bowl and my boyfriend had the spicy teriyaki chicken bowl. It was small, the chicken was the crappy part of the bird- brown, tendons and such. Overall very mediocre. Extremely overpriced. To top it off, when he paid for it on debit, and yes this was takeout, their debit forced him to tip. He tried to tip 1 cent but they forced him to tip more than that. Terrible."}
{"text":"I ordered Alberta Roll and the server repeated Alberta roll back to me but she brought me another roll that has salmon and I can't eat it because I've allergies. She didn't even apologize and left. I know a bit Korean so she kept saying that i repeated the Philadelphia roll and i said yes when i never heard Philadelphia! Anyways my trip to this restaurant sucked!"}
{"text":"Situated in the Glenndale Shopping Centre in the middle of what seems to be nowhere for a guy like me who spends most of his time in the good ol' hood.  This place gets backed basically right at 615pm it seems, so either get your reservations made or show up a bit earlier to ensure you get yourself a table to eat at.  Stone Pot Rice Bowl has an assortment of Sushi, Rolls, Sashimi, Rice Bowls, Noodle Bowls and Soups. Enough variety in their menu to keep your flavour buds entertained!  The staff here are super friendly, they greet you as you walk in and make sure you are seated as quick as possible and my only gripe with this place is when it is a full house their service slows down quite a bit and they start forgetting things that need to be made to order, I don't blame them, I don't think they were prepared for such a packed house and will most likely learn from this nights experience.  Here's what we ate:  Kimchi Gyoza  - I wasn't too impressed with this menu item because to me after having a kimchi grilled sandwich at Anju I expected it would be something similar via the dumpling wrap but it was just chopped pieces of I have no idea.  Beef Tataki Sashimi - I found this to be so delicious!! Sliced Rare Beef Tataki covered with chopped green onions, fried onions, lettuce and whatever delicious vinegrette sauce thing they used. YumYUM YUM! I feel like I need five plates of that (we did have two though.)  Spicy Chicken Bowl - If you like spice you'll LOVE this rice bowl because the tangy spicy sauce they use definitely has a KICK so order this bowl and grab yourself a glass of water and ENJOY because this bowl was just freakin delicious!  Dynamite Roll - Prawn Tempura, Avocado, Cucumber & Smelt Roe (Masago) + additional Salmon. Delicious as usual there wasn't anything to complain about with this roll.  Crazy Buster - Salmon Spring Roll wrapped with fresh Tuna, Salmon served with Spicy Sauce, Green Onion and Garlic Chip. Seriously my favorite roll it was so delicious, had a nice crunch factor to it and you can't just have one.  Power of Love Roll - Crab and Avocado roll wrapped with Unagi served with Unagi sauce and Wasabi Creamy sauce and Tobiko. My second favorite roll it was light, bit sweeter and I thought the ingredients all balanced each other out. YUM!  Alaska Roll - Smoked salmon, crab & avocado rolled with Rice and Seaweed. Also an enjoyable roll although I really wish they added the Philly Cheese to it to make it incredible.  California Roll - Crab & Avocado rolled with Rice and Seaweed. My least favorite roll of the five we chose to taste tonight only because the California roll is like the introduction to Sushi. Not much taste to it but still edible and enjoyable nonetheless.  I wish this place was closer to home because I would probably go there more often but being where it is in the middle of nowhere (for me) I'll only be by every once in awhile. Definitely check this place out if you want to try some great Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Odd location,  fantastic food, good value. I defiantly recomend giving this hole in the wall a try."}
{"text":"Perhaps I didn't order the right things...I ordered the Lion King Roll ($13.99) and it was filled with grey, fishy salmon. I was not impressed.   The Chicken Teriyaki Bowl ($9.99) was better. The chicken was tender and the rice was perfect, just the right amount chew to it.  The Scallop Pizza ($7.99) was decent. Each of the four pieces had two small pieces of scallop. The rice was deep-fried, so it was oily and gummy.  I would rather go to Gachi and get something more unique, fresh and flavourful."}
{"text":"We showed up here at about 7pm on a Friday and it was really busy for such a small place. Due to the rush we had to sit in a tight corner, but the waitresses were both incredibly friendly so that made up for it.   Dynamite roll, beef rice bowl and spicy rice bowl were all delicious. The roll seemed larger than the kind we usually get at other places.  A bunch of decor is left over from when te building housed the primal grounds coffee shop so it looks a little strange.   Would visit again"}
{"text":"*CURIOSITY GOT THE CAT*   Worst Japanese Restaurant (if you call it that)  in Calgary, Period.  Here's why:  Alright so I decided to treat my Mom to dinner.... we chose Hot Stone Rice Bowl Sushi & Roll  strictly based on location (it's 7 blocks away from my house) .  Plus, I drive by the place often. That it only made sense to promote small business and get to know the area's food selections... blah, blah, blah....  When we got there, parking was available... only 2-3 cars in the lot. Around 6pm on a Friday Night (odd)... you'd think a place in the middle of Westbrook & West-hills would be pumping with people. Inside the small nook of a building (the size of a 4 bedroom home) was dead.   Inside the place was olive green walls, funky chairs and tables fashioned from the 90's and recycled from the previous Cafe establishment. The place is best described as eclectic and work-in-progress.  I was greeted by 1 of the servers who offered us a table near the kitchen, of coarse with my Mom (being a picky eater) she demanded to review a menu first. The server gave us a unappeased look before handed us a menu and walking off annoyed.  We both saw some interesting appetizers and agreed on staying (we seated ourselves near a window by the entrance, the door was open giving a lovely breeze).  I couldn't help but notice the 70's tiles and the dirt swept into corners... the floor was very grimy... it made eating their questionable.  The menu was basic and forward, offering some perks like Sashimi in a combos package or stone plated dishes for the additional price of $2. The prices seemed fair and cheap.   However, what they don't tell you is if you don't choose to Hot Stone your plate the food is served room temperature... My Udon soup was luke warm, and the veggies had been added in raw without steaming or cooking them. The noodles were thick and I doubt they were Gluten Free as they suggested... I was constipated and bloated for 2 days after eating the soup 1/5 flavour was very bland aswell.  I tried the Alaska Roll 4/5 the salmon was perfectly smoked. Dynamite roll 1/5 the Tempura was actually a shake and bake with wheat flour and very hard to chew... Did NOT like it!  However the plating was well done, the sushi Rolls were sliced thinner then I am accustomed to, yet I like the size... I wasn't deep throating my food. In the future I will request smaller sushi rolls... genius!  My mothers had the House Green Salad, the dressing is a mysterious delicious Orange vingerette (with very little in the salad) and well plated. Topped with Julliene cukes, spiral Beets and sprinkled Sesame seeds.  I got a small salad aswell (came with the soup). She also ordered a Beef Teriaki,  except they forgot to add Teriaki sauce to her meal...  they also put alot of leaf lettuce and rice to make the dish appear full.... from her words: Bland & Disapointing come to mind. 1/5  I TRY TO KEEP IN MIND THE LOCATION IS NEW AND THEIR WORKING OUT THE PERKS... BUT SERIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE HAVE THE COOKING TALENT... WHILE OTHERS SHOULD JUST NOT BOTHER WITH BOILING WATER... IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT."}
{"text":"More of a fusion but still great anyway!  My family goes there at least once a week.  It reminds me of the old hole in the wall that my father hung out in all the time.  It's a small building that looks like it could be closed.  I think there used to be a dairy queen or some other ice cream shop there years ago.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  My family usually goes in there on mass and they are more than happy to accommodate us."}
{"text":"Hot stone rice bowl closed in February 2017. Yelp should update their site don't know what more you want me to say other than NO LONGER IN BUSINESS"}
{"text":"Decent place for a bite of Korean/Japanese food. Our favorite sushi place was closed today, so we thought we'd try this place. The sushi was average priced for average quality. Nothing super special, but the service was prompt and friendly. I left satisfied. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Team Fam came here for dinner and I got a good taste of the following: Beef Rice Stone Bowl Unagi Roll Seafood Miso Soup Avocado Roll Green Salad The seafood came mainly in the addition of some clams and mussels. These were clean and had a nice chewiness to them so thumbs up.  The unagi roll was your usual fare of eel and teriyaki sauce. The eel was quite flavourless underneath the drenching of teriyaki sauce and I think the sauce was just a quick way to add flavour to this roll.  Now we have the stone rice bowl. Indeed it sizzled on arrival and our server recommended we stirred it frequently so the rice would get crunchy but not stuck to the bowl. If you're looking for a high-level donburi this is a winnerbut keep in kind that it's an extra dollar for the stone bowl treatment.  And now with the green salad and avocado roll. If you're looking for cheaper filler, the avocado roll is a nice go-to with fresh-looking avocado and the green salad tends to come with the stone bowls."}
{"text":"Decent sushi and not over priced. It isn't the best in the city but it definitely satisfies a craving for under $30. A great go to place if your in the neighbourhood and want some take out."}
{"text":"We ordered a number of mostly-sushi items:  * Ebi / shrimp sushi * Toro / fatty tuna sushi * Sake / salmon sushi * Tako / octopus sushi * \"Crazy Buster\": a gimmicky roll containing a deep fried salmon spring roll * Beef rice bowl * Miso soup  It was... mostly ok. Higher quality than Edo or other mall food court sushi, but not great either. The fish portions on the sushi were on the smaller side, but that's perfectly reasonable given the inexpensive prices.  One thing that didn't work for me was the \"Crazy Buster\" roll. There was lot of of grey / brown salmon fat in the roll, which gave it an unpleasant appearance and taste.  Two things I thought were notable:  Another reviewer mentioned the smell. We were the first customers of the day, and I also noticed that the place didn't smell quite right when we walked in. I wasn't able to place exactly what it was; it wasn't a fishy smell.  The listing here says it's good for kids, and I can vouch for this. They gave our toddler kiddie cutlery and a cup she liked so much she wanted to take it home. At the end of the meal they brought out a basket of lollipops and offered one to our toddler. Little touches, but more than most sushi restaurants provide.  Overall, I thought this place was fine and wouldn't object to coming back, but I wouldn't make an effort to do so either."}
{"text":"First off, the sushi itself was mediocre, but I am giving them 2 stars for their service, as the server was attentive and the food came out quickly right after we ordered.  The restaurant itself needs to be revamped. It is quite dirty outside, the inside is a bit dated, the washrooms are horrible, and the smell of the dining area is a bit weird.  As soon as we came in we felt that it was not a busy day as the sushi chef was sitting in the dining area looking at his phone. Now we know why it wasn't all too busy.  We opted to try out some California, dynamite, mango, and  crunchy rolls. The rolls were quite big, so that was a good suprise. But the sushi was very dry, had not taste whatsoever, and fell apart quickly.  We did get a complimentary salad, but to be honest that didn't really help with the impending disappointment of the sushi. And even though we ordered different types of sushi rolls, they all seemed to taste the same. We are definitely glad that we did not order any sashimi!  Overall, we will not be coming back to this restaurant. And I don't think I am able to recommend it either :'("}
{"text":"Very grubby - needs a good cleaning - the front door is filthy - food was OK but the grimy feel made me wonder about what the kitchen is like. Won't be back."}
