{"text":"This place needs to be called the Cheers of Phoenix. Everybody knew everybody's name as they came in and left. The food was good but the friendliness of the staff and the fact that so many people were regulars made me think this is a place I need to go back to over and over as well. I had my usual, an omelet and fries for brunch on Sunday, which was exactly how I ordered it and tasted awesome. Pam, my server recommended chicken strips which are hand made from fresh chicken and did look delicious on another customers plate. Decor needs a little tidying up. I love the fact that they're honoring our service men and women but it is a little hodgepodge. Worth a visit if you like good food and places that like their regulars enough to know their names!"}
{"text":"Quaint, great, friendly service. Delicious food and coffee. Ever have Kielbasa for breakfast? If you haven't, try it:) The eggs Benedict and biscuits and gravy are also phenomenal."}
{"text":"This is a decent little neighborhood restaurant. I've eaten breakfast and lunch there. But were good, what I would expect. I had a veggie sandwich with turkey added. It was one of the only healthy options on the meal. But it was very good with all fresh ingredients. The guacamole was probably premade, but had a good flavor. The menu is diner-like.   I could tell they have a lot of \"regulars\". The staff are very friendly, like a family.   I look forward to eating there every once in awhile. I love to support privately-owned neighborhood restaurants."}
{"text":"I only give it 4 stars because the food was good, not incredible. The service was great and the waitress was very kind. I couldn't believe how cheap the food was, especially given that the portions were large.   I had the country fried steak and eggs with hash browns and muffins. They were even very willing to let me modify my order.   I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great service & great food! Brought a group of 13, 5 being small children. Everyone was so kind!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just went for breakfast here this past weekend. It's a very small, hole in the wall cafe. There was about a 15 min wait at 9am on a Saturday. Service was pretty good, but the food was super heavy. Seemed like they had a bunch of regulars. I would say we had an okay experience, but we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"My new #1 breakfast stop. Great hash browns with peppers and onions. The never ending cup of coffee is just that with the great service. We were really made to feel at home. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is simply amazing!! The Chefs in the kitchen know how to make everything on the menu taste delicious! The icing on the cake is the amazing group of ladies that welcome in and get you all ready to enjoy the tasty fare! The prices are very reasonable and I've always left satisfied!   Don't give it a second thought and try this out once and you'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The 40th Street Café is hidden away in a small strip center. It's definitely worth finding. A breakfast and lunch spot, the café has some of the friendliest servers around. They always recognize us and inquire if anyone in our party is missing - and we only eat here once or twice a month these days.   The café is small. You'll get to know those dining around you whether you want to or not. Look for a refrigerator case on your left at the back of the dining room. That's where you'll find a chalk board with specials posted. Great specials available during weekdays in particular. The kids meals are really inexpensive, as well, and your children will be rewarded with a free chocolate chip cookie on a stick at the end of the meal (with your permission of course).   If you arrive at a busy time (Saturday and Sunday mornings), write your name on the waiting list posted outside on a column. There are a few outdoor tables, but this is not a dog friendly establishment. There's a dog groomer and veterinarian next door... so the café gets a pass on this policy.  You may especially like it here if you are from the Midwest. I know my husband loves the 40th Street Café for that reason. The café has a pleasant small town feel, great baked goods and a classic menu. It's a wonderful place to go and escape when city life gets a bit too hectic."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich. Taylor ham. Sourdough, home fries.  That's what you need to get!! Great service!  Awesome menu!"}
{"text":"Our very favorite breakfast and lunch place! The best menu with options for every craving.  Locally owned and operated with our favorite servers and cooks too.  I highly recommend 40th Street if you aren't already among the loyal customer family!!!"}
{"text":"Why, why, WHY has no one told me about this place! This place is EXACTLY what I want when I go out to breakfast!  The location: Totally tucked into that strip mall at 4oth & Greenway where most people (including me) never get past Starbucks and The Gelato Spot. Small inside, but feels cozy.   The service: Awesome- nice ladies who fill up your coffee, are sweet to your kid and know that what they do is based on immediately making you feel comfortable. On a related note for those of you with kids- There is NOTHING I appreciate more at a restaurant than a server who 1) gets your kids food out as soon as possible. Eating kid = happy kid and 2) hands YOU the hot plate so you can take care of it, rather than dropping the plate in front of your 2 year old, announcing it's hot and leaving. DUH!  The food: Fantastic- I had the chicken and veggie skillet. I never order skillets because they are always greasy and loaded with cheese. I took a risk and it paid off! Perfect combo of yummy but  not, I need to purge after this!  The price: Just right, a LOT of food for not  a lot of money. Me, the wife, and our full size 2 year old ate for under $25. And let's just say I took food home- NEVER happens :)  The customers: Totally cool- the place is full of regulars who were all nice to our little one. It didn't hurt that he went table to table saying goodbye on our way out, but nothing makes me want to smash a face as much as a person who is rude to my kid so mad props to the regs!  All in all, this place  is just my speed and we will be back... A LOT!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food and good prices. Had never noticed it tucked away in the plaza till a friend of mine mentioned it to me. I was not expecting much from the outside but I am glad I went in."}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome staff, and awesome food. My wife and I were looking for a nice homey place in the big city and found it here. The place is always packed though that never deters the wait staff from taking time to check on us, refill our coffee, etc. We have young children and never feel as though we're \"those people with the kids\". Great food, great prices!"}
{"text":"For the last 11 years, if you were looking for me, all you've had to do was hang around 40th Street Cafe and I'd turn up eventually. I've tried virtually everything on the menu and we've built a few things that have been very successful. My #6 daily special is scrambled eggs with green chile & onions, hash browns, warm salsa & a flour tortilla. Not on the board, but Sherrie (and more than a few regulars) will know exactly what you mean.  I'm not a big chicken guy but the fried chicken strips with French fries would make the real Colonel proud! Terrific coating, crunchy & tasty.  Don't miss the homemade soups. According to David Abella, a renowned chef, \"complex & flavorful.\" He went to the kitchen to compliment the cooks. The fried fish (special on Fridays) is among the best you'll enjoy. Again, a breading that fries perfectly & tastes great. Peggy runs a fine, friendly, patriotic, community cafe. Enjoy it for what it is. There are very few left."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. It reminds us of the Mom and Pop diners we grew up with in New Jersey. yGreat breakfast, they serve Taylor Ham, if you grew up in North Jersey it's called this if you grew up down the shore they call it Pork Roll. Tasty cheeseburgers and good turkey clubs."}
{"text":"Breakfast special:2 egg omelet, home fries, and English muffin was excellent! Service is great, and pecan pie slice purchased to go didn't make it out the door! :)"}
{"text":"The chicken enchilada soup is dream worthy...yum!!!!!!"}
{"text":"40th Street Diner is a very special place.  I think the first time we were in was the day they opened.  We lived in the nearby Greenway/Tatum area and I sold a lot of homes there so I would always know at least one person having breakfast at the same time as me.  It's the kind of \"old fashioned\" neighborhood place where everyone joins in everyone elses conversations, be it the weather or current events.  Sure there are differences of opinions but that's what makes people keep coming back.  The food for breakfast is as good as it gets with lots of love added to each plate.   We've since moved to far west Peoria and I really miss the old neighborhood friendliness and the 40th Street Cafe. If you love people and good conversation and amazing food be sure to drop in, by cautioned though it will soon be a regular place to meet friends and make new friends also.  Peggy we miss seeing you!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. It is always busy and the food and service are great. It's the small town resturant in the big city."}
{"text":"This has become one of our regular after-church places.  Their skillets are great.  This is an old-fashioned, family owned cafe with tasty yummy comfort food that we have enjoyed for years.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality you receive.   Coffee is always hot, service is prompt, and the portions are generous.   I love their two egg skillets."}
{"text":"The food is diner-ific. Small dining space, often waits. But when you're craving a greasy spoon, not a bad option. Yummy hash, super chicken fingers, solid burger. Don't try sarcasm with the staff. You've been warned."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years. I love the breakfast options, and there is always a special going. But it is the atmosphere and the people that make this place special.  It is kind of like a family where everyone is welcome. The regulars are there, but if you are going for the first time it is friendly, inviting, and comfortable. I like the home fries - nice chunky breakfast potatoes. You can get them in a skillet or just on the side. Yum!"}
{"text":"It's not often I feel the need to rush home to post a review for a place I have just eaten.  But I am in a breakfast bliss thanks to this place.    Moving to a different part of town is difficult, especially when it comes to things like finding all new places to eat a inexpensive yet great breakfast on the weekends. Alas, the Peoria Cafe is too far away for a Saturday morning breakfast run, so a new \"hole in the wall\" was needed. I refuse the \"popular\" standards such as IHOP and Denny's, and I was worried that there might not be a suitable spot nearby.  Thank God for Yelp! The reviews were mostly good for this place, which was only a few miles away, so thought I would try it.  Everyone said to expect a line, but I got lucky and grabbed a spot at the counter right away. Ordered something simple; eggs and bacon with hash browns and toast. OMG, the bacon, the bacon.  It was incredible, the thickest, most wonderful bacon I have eaten in a while.  Hash browns were crispy (not greasy) and eggs, well are eggs.  I can't wait to bring all my family here when they visit!   ONe thing though, when people say it is small, they are not kidding.  Even after reading that, I was surprised how small it was.  There are about 15 tables packed in there, and that's it. One of the waitresses was talking about 2 guys sitting at a table talking for over 3 hours - don't be rude, go somewhere else and catch up.  Make room for someone else to sit down and let your waitress earn a living."}
{"text":"Excellent service and huge portions of food. Went here for lunch with my dad and cousin and all of us enjoyed our meals. I had the Reuben sandwich that had a generous portion of meat on it. I liked that they put the dressing on the side. Best crinkle cut fries ever!  It is a small place and I was too full to try their homemade pies. I will have to go back next time I'm out here."}
{"text":"Very at home feeling cafe. The staff is bright and smiley. There are a lot of regulars. The food itself is really good if your looking for mom's cooking. Atmosphere is a \"comfortable active\" feeling. I got the corn beef hash plate. Very good. Must try the home fries. All together a very nice quaint eatery. Will return!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast had country fried steak with home fries and eggs. Small cafe but super sweet wait staff. Will be back"}
{"text":"Rude owners and bad food. Could also do without the war shrine.  We were told the wait would be a few minutes. After much longer, I poked my head inside to assess, since my son had to get to work in a bit. The owner asked me what I wanted and I tried to explain. She bit my head off and told me not to argue with her.  Why do people go to a place like this? What happened to hospitality? Why not give the customer some courtesy for spending their hard earned money at your place of business.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Hidden in a strip mall with all the usual stores you'd find on a busy intersection. All the staff are very friendly and treat you like family. Nothing we've ordered has been extraordinarily great, just all really good. They're very helpful with any special orders. When you're tired of all the chains this is a nice alternative,"}
{"text":"My family and I have been faithful, frequent patrons of this place for 6 1/2 years.  We appreciated the service, food, and prices.  However, things have changed for the worse!  On our last few visits, the portion sizes have been consistently shrinking.  I suspect sub-standard ingredients in use, as well.  Such a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  After all this time, I can no longer count on my expectations being fulfilled.  I feel so CHEATED!  I would much rather see a fair price increase than have to search for a new favorite spot."}
{"text":"On July 4th I came here after reading a recommendation on Yelp, because my regular place was closed. As advertised, a classic diner with friendly staff.  If you go sit at the counter where the regulars interact with the waitresses.  All good fun. Enjoyed my 2 eggs sunny side up with sausage, hash browns and sourdough toast.  The toast were slathered in butter  - Yum - and the hash browns were crispy. A very good breakfast!!!!!  If you are into organic, farm to table, GF, or you need a fancy new hipster cool place, it is not for you.  No Kale on the menu. Pretty sure the eggs are not farm raised.  Although there are salads, with Balsamic on the side :)  Old school, down home, good food, reasonable prices and atmosphere. Nuff said."}
{"text":"This place is like a step back in time. When food served in a restaurant tasted like mom would make. I eat here mainly for breakfast and iv'e never had a bad meal. The portions are plentiful and the food is good. I'm not talking fancy just good food for the money. They also have awesome meal deals."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall mom n' pop eatery!  Delicious brunch. Fresh baked goods. Excellent fast Customer Service. We ordered eggs Benedict and the super skillet. Everything was good and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My bf and I weren't a fan of this place. It's very loud and small inside. I ordered a mushroom and cheese omelette, bacon and a biscuit. Bf ordered a spanish omelet with salsa and home fries. My omelette wasn't seasoned at all and lacked flavor. The bacon and biscuit were great tho. The bf liked his meal. The one thing we both agreed on was that the coffee was awful!!"}
{"text":"This is a really fun neighborhood cafe. Nice breakfast menu and food is great. The cafe is really small so there isn't room to wait inside. Also, be sure to add your name to the waitlist when you arrive."}
{"text":"Great local cafe !!! Good local crowd which generally means good food too and I was NOT disappointed! Seating indoors or out. Had biscuits and sausage gravy, which to me is a defining dish. It the cooks make good sausage gravy you can BET the rest of the food is good. Scored 9 out of 10 there. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  It's a small restaurant in a strip mall.  They have really good breakfast.  I love their biscuits and gravy.  The prices are really reasonable and have great customer service.  It's funny I have eaten at this place 3 times now, and it seems I see the same customers in there.  They must have a lot of regular customers.  My waitress was very good and always checked up on us.  I would recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"If you like good, no fuss, comfort food, this is your breakfast joint. Hipsters, move along. For a restaurant that has carpeting, it's incredibly clean! Most places with carpeting have a terrible musty odor, but this place didn't smell bad at all.   For a small mom and pop, their menu is pretty extensive. We went in at 1:30 p.m., and it was still 3/4 full. The clientele was an older crowd, but mostly all regulars. There was a lot of good humored banter between the customers and the wait staff. We were told to seat ourselves and were given our menus immediately.   When I go to a restaurant, I like to get recommendations from the wait staff on their favorite dish on the menu. I always end up with a happy stomach this way. Based on the server's suggestion, I got the chicken fried steak which came covered in their homemade gravy. It was seasoned perfectly and not too overtly salty! I substituted the potatoes with grits which were nom nom nom. With my meal, I ordered the biscuit and it was also homemade like Grandma made. The only complaint I have is that they served the biscuit and grits with margarine. Big no-no.  The service was first rate and our coffee was refilled on regular intervals. I'll definitely be back again. Despite the margarine debacle, I'm a huge fan of this place."}
{"text":"Ya'll come! Friendly down to earth good fixin's and hot coffee! 2 tv's in case you dine alone, but come back a 2nd time and the staff will become like family. :)"}
{"text":"Good food. Busy place. I had a chili size and my hubby had a grilled pastrami.  The chili size was good, not great. It was not quite hot enough. Fries were yummy. Servicer was pleasant.  Looks like a lot of regulars come here as it was always humming."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The food, the atmosphere, the service. It's all a top notch old school diner experience that you used to get years ago"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The wait for a table is always long, the wait for your food even longer.  The waitress spilled coffee on my leg and wouldn't even apologize. The food is average."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure all the amazing reviews of this establishment are thanks in large part to the friendly staff.  It was so cool to watch them in action, like an old movie set at a diner.  Their interaction with the customers, particularly the regulars, was so nice and welcoming I could barely stand it.  For that reason, I can see this place being rated highly.  As for the food, I found it to be pretty standard breakfast fair.  I had corned beef hash with eggs.  I asked for my eggs medium, but they came out a bit under for me with the whites a little runny, so I barely touched them.  The hash browns and corned beef were pretty good with a nice crispiness.  I asked for a biscuit on the side, which was a nice treat.  Could have been cooked a tad longer, but all in all it was tasty.  I would surly come back to 40th Street Cafe.  The quaint diner feel was so unique and nice... that would bring me back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely a hidden gem. The staff is the best. I've dabbled around their menu for a few years but always come back to the crispy chicken cobb. Craving it now!!"}
{"text":"Just had the #1 breakfast special . It was perfect . The home fries are the bomb ! Tina was my waitress .  She always remember me . And she's efficient , friendly, and gets the job done . This place rocks !"}
{"text":"4 out of 5 stars only because the cafe is small and the floors were dirty.   Other than that, the service and food was great. I had the Eggs Benedict and my husband had the corned beef hash. (Seems to be a breakfast trend of ours as of late). The Benedict sauce was delicious, I was even dipping the potatoes in it.   Plenty of food at a good price. I look forward to coming back and trying a different item on the menu."}
{"text":"Always a great place to have breakfast! Definitely our favorite!! You'll feel like family as soon as you walk into the cafe! Staff is wonderful and the food is delicious.   French toast griddle, scrambled eggs with cheese, all bacon. PERFECT mix of salty and sweet!"}
{"text":"Great service! Coffee cup never went cold! Corn beef hash was perfectly done! I will be back! Heads up you can order half a waffle."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Comfy vibe amazing food. Food had a new England taste to it and will definitely be going back.  Highly recommended. Prices are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I just never understand how people can think this cafe is so great.  My folks regularly eat here, but every single time I have gone, I have been very disappointed with the quality of their food.  I was there yesterday (with my folks) and ordered 1/2 grilled cheese and a bowl of French Onion soup.  My sandwich was cold, cheese not melted, and my soup had unmelted square cheese sticking out the bottom.  It was barely hot.  My Mom had the fish and chips and she said it was the worst fish ever.  When we left the place, it was packed.  I guess I simply look for good food, prepared to order, and served hot.  Not my favorite place, and I think it was my last visit."}
{"text":"This is a great little hidaway breakfast place with great food and generous portions.  Is the staff knockout friendly, no, but I am not conversing with them during breakfast either, so I don't care.  They're pleasant enough and efficient.  The place is always full, but I have also always managed to get a table pretty quickly.  The skillet breakfasts are super!!!!   The only reason why I took away a star is that you're no longer able to sit outside with your dog.  It used to be dog friendly and I loved walking a half mile with my small dog, have some good breakfast, and walk back home.  It's a shame, but I'm sure they have their reasons.  Still... dog friendly places always get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's a place were everyone knows your name. It has a great atmosphere and everyone is very nice. After having breakfast here for the first time 5 years ago, I've never gone anywhere else but here for breakfast now. It's like a once a week tradition. My 3 kids under 8 also love this place. There nothing on the menu we haven't liked, but I love the biscuits, pancakes, and the occasional Texas burger."}
{"text":"The service was very good and very attentive. The food was OK. I got the chicken salad sandwich which was very tasty. The potato salad was very bland snd I wouldn't order it again. They were very busy. All the tables were full when we were there."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this little place has been here for 23 years and I only found it within the past year. Been here four times and it is always delicious. Both for breakfast and lunch. During the week and on a Sunday. It can get busy. That's a good thing. The waitresses are so friendly and helpful. The onion rings are incredible. I had the tuna melt yesterday and it was really good. No fishy smell or taste. They are known for their chicken strips.  I so appreciate going to a restaurant that is locally owned. Much better than a chain restaurant. The restaurant is pretty small. We mostly sit outside. It is truly worth a try."}
{"text":"I love the biscuits and gravy. With a side of bacon. Fast and hot. Quick service. The staff is very friendly. Everyone is very out going. Well another day with biscuits and gravy with side of bacon and large milk and water. I love this place. Well on 10/18/16 I showed up at 4:00am, too early. But I waited and had my biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon large milk and large water. Great as always."}
{"text":"Just sat down enjoying a really great cup of joe. As my first time here, i am enjoying the decor American Pride. I feel at home. Service is top notch. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"Food was average. I had the oversized omelet, which wasn't that big. My girlfriend had two eggs,  potatoes,  and a biscuit. She really liked the biscuit. Her dad had a skilet, which he said was good,  but some of the potatoes were undercooked.  Service was good. The place was full, but we were seated quickly."}
{"text":"This is a tiny, unassuming hole in the wall (the sign outside only says \"cafe\"), but it's a great little place that really hits the spot.   Pretty sure they're only open for breakfast and lunch, it also seems to be a real \"regulars\" type of place as well, so the service is very 'down-home'y.  I ordered chili geese fries with a side of bacon and a tortilla so I could cobble together a whacky burrito of sorts, and my boyfriend got the fried chicken. Everything was delicious, hot and fast. I can easily see myself having many more hungover breakfasts here!"}
{"text":"This a a great local place where you can get diner food and be treated like they are happy to have you drop by for a meal. The first time I went, I felt like an outsider because everyone seemed to know each other and the servers. The second time I went-the servers remembered me and welcomed me back. They even remembered what I drank. Needless to say-this a a friendly local place with simple good food at an affordable price. They must be doing something right because there is always a nice crowd of people but you can still get a table. They top off your drinks the entire meal!!  I enjoy this cafe and frequent it often."}
{"text":"I love coming here because the food is good and hearty - bacon & eggs, pancakes, etc.  You can also get lunch and the prices are reasonable.    There is one room only so you might have to wait at breakfast time but it's worth it.  The servers are very friendly and make you feel at home.  There are a couple of tables on the sidewalk outside."}
{"text":"I've review this place before, but felt I needed to update. We have tried several different breakfast places, and still come back to 40th Street Cafe every time We LVE the staff - Tina, Sherry, Ethyl, Kim, Fred, ALL of them are friendly, funny, anxious to please, and treat you like old friends.  Peggy did a wonderful thing when she opened this establishment"}
{"text":"I had been to 40th St. Cafe a few times previous to my last visit and thought quite highly of the place, however, my last (and final) visit was a total nightmare...I got food poisoning for the first time of my life and have finally been able to keep solids/liquids down.  I would not wish food poisoning on my worst enemy.   FWIW, I had the ultimate skillet for breakfast (I know - it sounds gross just saying it), so I'd surely recommend treading lightly with the meat if you visit this spot.    Additionally, the service was lousy and there were a lot of weird vibes/negative energy around the place.  I opted not to report this to the health department and decided to post to Yelp instead."}
{"text":"Omg this place is unreal! I try to eat mostly plant-based food (and they do have veg options which is FANTASTIC), but the French dip was calling my name and, well, now it's gone...devoured...wonderful soft bread...crispy, fresh fries. I was staring at someone's nachos and contemplating that (next time) because they make their tortilla chips!!!!!!!!!! Everyone should make their own chips...this place is one in which I will return. Absolutely. Many regulars."}
{"text":"Good place for a warm breakfast.  Servers are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Nicest owner and staff but real small dinning area but if you can get past that or in for that matter Food is just good home cooking at great prices it is in my monthly routine now"}
{"text":"I am really more of an A-OK, but I know my husband would definitely bump this to four stars. Great place for a quick, good and inexpensive breakfast.  How many places in Phoenix or any big US city can you get a two egg spinach omelette with tip for under $10?  Definitely a mom and pop which leads to consistently good food. If you are a foodie, then go elsewhere. This cafe is just that a little cafe with American breakfasts including chicken fried steak and corn beef hash."}
{"text":"This is the friendliest restaurant you'll find in town.  Excellent service and really tasty food. I can't eat gluten and they were willing to substitute fruit for toast. Reasonably priced, too."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff, but it is just too small and the food is subpar.  With all the other breakfast spots in the area, they need to step up their game.  Food is just as important as the service!"}
{"text":"Very happy that I went here. It's like a family owned business , the owner I believe was there too and she greets every one and if the staff are busy she would help. The staff were friendly, acknowledged me and she brought the food in no time. I also ordered bacon instead of ham on my sandwich which wasn't in menu and she did it for me. Very satisfied with my visit will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have come here multiple times for breakfast and they never disappoint! They have great portion sizes and great friendly service too! I recommend this place as much as possible!"}
{"text":"Best chicken in town from chicken strips to chicken salads to chicken and waffles to chicken sandwiches. That's  one of their specialties. But they have many more and can customize anything you'd like  too!  Would give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Wow this was place is so creepy and the customers are just as creepy,A friend of mine hade mentioned that this place had good breakfast,so I thought I would give it a try.I walked in the joint to give it a try and the looks i got when i walked in where enough to make me want to run out I have never seen more racist freaks crammed into a small place in my life,The Career sever was just as racist as all of the freaks in the joint, just rude as hell,Bottom line if you you want to experience phoenix racism at it's best go to 40th st Cafe,food cold service terrible and rude career waitress from hell, i would warn anyone who is not white and ignorant to not set foot in this place,more freakks and employees crammed into this place than i have ever seen!Stay clear unless your writeing a book on racism in phoenix at its best."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Good food, great prices, and a free cookie for our daughter when we leave! The waitresses are friendly and competent, we've never had a bad experience (and we live across the street, so we've gone quite a few times!). Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Was told about this place very good food and service. Over easy Eggs, hashbrowns, bacon and English muffin. Cooked to order wonderful. Very busy still great service."}
{"text":"Great place. The food was good. The prices were reasonable, and the service was great. It's a great neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Had been meaning to try this place for a while and decided to come here on a weekday off from work, hoping for no wait. Well, I was wrong, even on a Monday there was about a 10-15 minute wait. Oh, it may have been a holiday...  Pam was our server and she was very upbeat, friendly and prompt. Food was good. I had my no fuss keto friendly breakfast (2 eggs over medium and a side of bacon, plus decaf) and I had to try their chicken fried steak (which I did not fall in love with). Hubby had a chorizo skillet and diet. I have no clue about the individual prices because the order and receipt are handwritten, but it was $25 before tip.  We may be back eventually but not very often, for me the cons would be wait time (good for them), and the place is a little too small/crowded. The search for our favorite weekday breakfast place continues : )"}
{"text":"Amazing chicken fried steak. Definitely worth the wait. The gravy and orange juice were really good as well. Even though they were super busy the waitress kept up!"}
{"text":"This place had impressed us in 2007. So, while vacationing in Phoenix yet one more time, we were trying to re-live good old times, we returned.  Sadly, this time it was not meant to be a happy experience for all.  Seeing meatloaf on the menu is Mr. B's signal to stop looking. But, too bad. This meatloaf sandwich was beyond salty. I think if the chef had practiced some restraint on the salt, the meatloaf might have been wonderful.  It had a unique sweetness (perhaps the bell pepper?) that I thought was good. But then there were also the powdered mashed potatoes covered with a salty brown gravy and the overcooked green beans. Frankly, it did not cut it. I knew I would hear about it later.  My breakfast was supposed to be a home baked biscuit topped with ham and egg and gravy.  I requested my biscuit be served separately and they kindly provided it on a separate plate with some butter.  Huge and thick it was, but you and I know being big does not necessarily make it better.  This biscuit was dense and doughy. I was going to give it the benefit of the doubt and picked out one blackberry jam packet from a carrier set on the table.  And lucky I did.  The waitress came by and smilingly asked me if I had enough jam.  Not getting her drift, I said yes.  Then she, without further ado, commandeered that little jam organizer and presented it to another table.  Whut? Is this yet another recessionary tactic?  My eggs were scrambled nicely. And the smokey ham was thinly sliced and tasty. The sausage gravy was delicious.  But I was still reeling from the jam thievery. As it turned out, I was not that impressed with the biscuit and ended up leaving the outsides on the plate and eating the buttered innards with my teaspoon of jam. So I guess she did me a favor so I wouldn't eat so many carbs without thinking.  BTW - The hashbrowns were perfect. Soft inside and crispy outside. Ate em all.  Coffee is by Farmer Brothers. A brew that is too light for my liking. I passed.  So, while my breakfast was OK, the meatloaf was a complete let down.  I doubt I will be able to get Mr. B back.  Once bit, twice shy."}
{"text":"This place is about setting the right expectations. This is a simple, friendly and family owned diner. The service is super friendly and I think if you lived here they would remember all your qualms. Based on the ambience we kept it basic. My husband had the griddle and I the healthy omelette. Both were good, although the toast was below my standard. Consider it to be generic brand wheat bread. The restaurant is easy to find and there is plenty of parking especially in the early morning.   Bottom line...if you are looking for a basic diner breakfast with the added family friendly service...you will love this place    Pros Family friendly and great service  Good griddle and healthy breakfast  Easy parking  Clean basic ambience   Cons  The toast was below par for my standards...I think they could get something slightly better   Cons"}
{"text":"What a find!  Thank you Yelp!!  We came here for breakfast a week or so ago for the first time and my oh my.  It was fantastic!  My husband could tell it was good because I actually ate all of my scrambled eggs and I rarely do that.  My husband ordered the chicken fried steak.  They hand bread this here and he said it was phenomenal.  Everything about our breakfast was great from start to finish.  This place is tiny and in a little strip mall next to a dog grooming salon.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved going here. Didn't know this hidden gem is right around the corner from my house. While the inside may be a little cramped, they have every home cooked meal you can think of. Their breakfast? KILLER. My server was about average as far as serving can go but that's not going to stop me from coming back! Great little shin dig."}
{"text":"Sherrie is the best. She knows everybody that comes in by name; knows what they want and treats everybody like family. And the food is really, really good too.  Me and some buddies have been eating here for over 4 years and we recommend it all the time. Most mornings we see a lot of friends here from church as well"}
{"text":"French toast, bacon, perfectly cooked over-medium eggs, biscuits and gravy!!! All sooooo good and the staff was so friendly. I can't wait to try the pancakes next time."}
{"text":"This year marks the 15th Year 40th St has been open. This year marks the 1st time I have been there......That is a sad thing. This place is exactly what I want.   1. Homemade food. I am not talking about just the soup either.   2. Small and friendly   3. Good prices and portions to match   I had the meatloaf open faced sandwich served with mashed potato's and corn. It was the best I have had in years. Maybe the best ever. They wrap the ML in bacon while cooking it. It gives a good flavor to the meat and they even slice some of the bacon in with the meal.   PS the biscuits look amazing."}
{"text":"This afternoon was our second time visiting, and it absolutely hit the spot! Small, quiet, local and inexpensive-- and so delcious! I ordered the griddle with pancakes and ate every single bite, which is unusual for me to do. My husband ordered the chicken fried steak skillet and it was huge and full of flavor! We would pick this place over the trendy & loud brunch spots any day of the week.  Planning to make this our 'regular' spot."}
{"text":"REALLY small. Not that there is anything wrong with that.  Very friendly staff and a really good chicken fried steak and eggs. Your coffee cup will never be empty."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day while I was in the area. I didn't know this place was here until I saw something on Yelp. I was looking for a place to eat lunch and this one had had pretty good reviews from Yelp friends.  From outside, all it said was \"cafe\".  Without the Yelp picture of the front, I wouldn't have known this was the 40th street cafe.  From the reviews I read, I knew what to expect. Trip to Midwest.  When I walked in, I really thought other reviewers were correct, I felt like I was back in Ohio from my younger days.  Decor, service and everything about this place is like they just moved the whole restaurant (food and people) here.  Although it was during lunch time, the first picture I saw on yelp was Egg Benedict, I couldn't help myself but order one for myself.  Good old traditional Egg Benedict. Nothing fancy, just good old kind.  I looked like I was the youngest customer there. Most seemed to be retired from work.  Servers seemed to know most of the customers. Nice friendly restaurant with basic food. I felt comfortable eating here."}
{"text":"The fact they kept skipping over us after waiting a whole 1 hr outside smh but beside that the food was ok for a hole in the wall spot."}
{"text":"Awesome old school family run diner! Wait staff fun and friendly, menu carries the usual favorites and then there's a section of customer faves. Small and crowded but you're made to welcome and part of the crowd. Food great- this place is a treat!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices and big servings. Great place for breakfast, brunch or lunch. Waitresses are pretty, funny and make you feel very welcomed. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"On a Monday morning decided to come to this local neighborhood café that my dad suggested! Supposedly I have been here before back in my teens days, but simply could not remember. Let's just say this is my first time, long time visit at this small and quaint café. Decorated with U.S. veteran memorabilia is a nice look. Impresed how they had good specials listed on a small blackboard. Dad went with the eggs and toast special and I went with the eggs and corned beef patty special. Really cool that hash browns and toast/biscuit came on the side.  The coffee was delicious and strong just like I like it! Great experience for Monday morning with my pops. Sorry did not provide any pictures, I was starving and simply forgot :("}
{"text":"40th St Cafe is a little neighborhood breakfast/lunch cafe with about 5 stools at the counter, 20 tables inside and three or four outside.   The staff is upbeat and friendly toward everyone.  If you've been there a few  times, they remember your beverages. You never have to wait long for your food which is basic and consistent.  There is always a breakfast special and a lunch special with a couple of soups they make.   When we enter, we always check to see the message on the blocks and the special(s) listed on the chalkboard. I love when they have a special with chips, because they make their own.  For a bottomless cup of coffee and Coke, a breakfast, and a lunch, our bill has never been over $20.  These days, that's a bargain!   Relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Nothing says family like 40th St. Cafe. My family and I have been going to 40th St Cafe since I was a kid and it has a special place in my heart.  My mom was at 40th St Cafe every day for coffee, many days for lunch, and we often went for dinner. Being a single mom, raising two boys, she also was allowed to pick up shifts to earn extra money. When she was hospitalized for pneumonia, the cafe fed my brother and I. One of her dreams was to take us back to New York and show us where she grew up, but we could never afford it. . After she was diagnosed with cancer, the cafe staff, and some of the regulars raised enough money to send my mom, brother, and I to New York for a week with spending money. Our whole family was also there for a big reunion. It is a trip we will never forget. 5 years ago, we lost my mom to breast cancer. Every year, the cafe participates in the Walk for the Cure in honor of my mom and others that have passed.    I live in Gilbert now, so I do not go as often as I would like, but any opportunity to get to that side of town, 40th St Cafe is where I will go. Peggy's Pies are incredible! Best in the valley. If you like good home cooked meals, this is the place to go. I usually end up ordering the Cobb Salad with Blue Cheese dressing. They make their own Blue Cheese, and it is amazing, different than what you are used to. I also love their Guacamole Burger. For breakfast, you cannot go wrong with the Ultimate Skillet.    So if you are anything like me and like to bring business to people who really go the extra mile to make a difference in people's lives, then go check it out. You won't be sorry you did. :)"}
{"text":"there are great reviews for this place, but for me, the experience was only so-so. the food really wasn't anything impressive. the eggs themselves were fine, but salsa was too watery and made them runny. the toast tasted like white bread but they said it was sourdough. the hash browns were the best part of the meal. it was very cramped and there was no clear path to the door. you sit basically on top of other guests - no real space between tables, which is awkward unless you're the type of person that  wants to get to know the strangers seated 2 feet from your table. our server wasn't so friendly either. i don't think i'll be back."}
{"text":"Meh, disappointing. The food and service were nothing to write home about. I got the Eggs Benedict. The hollandaise was tasteless and coffee tasted like dirt.  My plate was taken away by Tina without being asked if I was done.  The same server didn't even thank me when she gave me my bill.  I would have had better food and service at Denny's."}
{"text":"I Love this little Cafe. I have been going to 40th Street since they opened. I'm pretty sure my Dad's a regular. Everything I get is just how I expect it. My usual is ham and eggs which is a pretty good size breakfast to include hashbrowns and a bread. Coffee is wonderful!!  I have even tried their lunches. They made a pretty good burger and buffalo chicken sandwich is great. They have great daily specials as well. Friendly ladies too. Thanks Ladies =)"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since it opened.  Hate to admit, but damn thats a long time. Out of the 50 plus visits over the years, I have never had a bad experience. Every food item is top notch, and the desserts are amazing. For some reason i havent been in quite some time, but it was as good as ever yesterday when i was there.  Many have posted,and its true..this is like eating at home."}
{"text":"I think Daren C. and I have the same taste buds! Now that I have mine back that is.... long story.   I went to have my dogs groomed in the area and the owner of the kennel said this joint has a great breakfast.  So I love to eat and I had an hour to kill so 40th street here I come. He was right this joint has a pretty tasty Bfast. I had this skillet with Eggs, Chorizo, onions, peppers and potatoes. It was huge! It was nummy nu mmy in my tummy. The best part is.......wait for it.........they had my favorite coffee ever! Farmer Brothers! I am not a coffee drinker and don't claim to be but I will drink a pot of that Farmer Brothers it is so good! Warning do not order the sausage gravy, it is not real gravy and they just toss sausage in it YUCK! Besides the gravy and one annoying waitress. This joint is cool with me. I took one star away because they need to clean a little better. All and all good food, good price, good portions and a good start to my day! Thanks"}
{"text":"So this cafe, is pretty standard. I mean they have the food you'd expect for breakfast.  I really am surprised by how high the ratings are. I was not impressed at all by the food they served. I love going into diners/cafes and this just didn't meet my expectations.  Their omelettes were whack. Tasted rubbery and eggs were way over cooked. The cheese they used was not right at all either.   I hope all their high ratings were from the lunch menu, because breakfast is not worth it in my opinion..  Staff was nice and that is what prevents them from going under the 3 star mark."}
{"text":"I have only had breakfast here a few times, but thought it was great. They have large portioned, country style breakfasts. Very good value since some of the other nearby breakfast places charge much more for smaller portions. Everything tastes fresh (no frozen potatoes!) and the service is friendly. I just wish it was a little bigger inside the restaurant, since its a bit cramped."}
{"text":"I love finding local cafes that combine good food with attentive service and this little place doesn't disappoint. Came in for brunch on Mother's Day and while even though they were hopping we were able to get a table for 4 promptly. Patio dining is very limited, so if want to dine outside on a beautiful day you'll need a little luck. The staff was very friendly and attentive - my coffee cup was never empty! Food was presented well and tasted great. Everyone at our table enjoyed their meal and agreed this cute little place is a gem. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"A simple Diner-like feel where everything is homemade. The restaurant is spotless even though the tables are pretty tightly cramped. I would not recommend this place for groups but if you just want to go in and get a hearty breakfast or lunch this is a good place. The prices are great and the servers do a wonderful job. There's a reason this place is always packed. Definitely worth the wait"}
{"text":"Went here after not wanting to wait at another spot. We got right in. The chicken fried steak skillet is good and loaded with potatoes. The gravy is a little bland. The service was spotty and at one point we were taking bets on if I'd get my toast. I did. Would go back"}
{"text":"This is a tiny Mom & Pop sort of diner that would be perfect to order \"flapjacks\" from, which I'm determined to do on my next visit. This time, I ordered orange juice (fresh squeezed, it tasted like) and eggs, chorizo, potatoes, and a tortilla. Why do I ever order chorizo from a non-Mexican place? I don't know. But aside from that, my breakfast burrito was pretty tasty. I love that they only do sausage patties (my favorite!) and that we were able to sit outside and watch the slow parade of dogs going in and out of the grooming place a few doors away.   Next time: flapjacks, an egg, and a hot chocolate outside. That's right. I'm doing it."}
{"text":"Stopped here an early morning as I was headed to Starbucks in the same parking lot. I really wanted breakfast with my coffee and I spotted the small flashing \"Open\" sign when I parked. I'm so happy I wandered in. I enjoyed a tasty breakfast sandwich with Taylor Ham (a New Jersey staple, I felt right at home) and a coffee cup that was never empty. Friendly, clean and homey diner atmosphere. I'm pretty sure everyone else in the restaurant was a regular and I can see why. I love this place and will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I have only had breakfast but the food is sooo good. It's a really small place so there us usually a wait but it'sworth it. Enjoy. : )"}
{"text":"Returned here after a few years between visits..  My previous breakfast experiences had been great, but this time (for lunch) disappointing.  Had the \"skillet\" which had overcooked scrambled eggs atop a congealed mess of potatoes, etc.  My guest (who'd never been here & to whom I'd highly recommended the 40th St. Cafe) had a similarly mediocre meal.  Maybe an off day for the cook? I still like the diner vibe and the service is just fine, plus prices are reasonable.  Will try again & hopefully this recent experience was just an anomaly."}
{"text":"Old school café with awesome food, great service, and great prices!"}
{"text":"A small small cafe about as large as a living room, but the food is exceptional and the service is great. It's a little hole in the wall that's almost literally in a hole in a wall.  They cater especially to service members; military, fire and police. A very patriotic place which in my opinion makes it shine a little more.  Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday just after 11am so we just missed their breakfast specials. Our meals were very large and priced well. I had a combo plate with pancakes, eggs and sausage. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese on the side as well.  The pancakes were very large and fluffy and my eggs were poached PERFECTLY!  The bagel was very fresh tasting... not sure if they make them there but I would be surprised if they didn't!  Did have to take one star away because my husband did not enjoy his Eggs Benedict.  The hollandaise sauce was quite bland and not a true hollandaise sauce at all. Other than that we really enjoyed our server, she was very friendly and never let our coffee cups go empty.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  I have been coming here for about 12 years.  The service is always great, and their food is even better.  I have brought many friends and family here and they always enjoy their food.  The country scramble is heaven."}
{"text":"Service 5/5 Staff was awesome...Friendly, quick, & attentive! They doted over our baby too so that helped!  Food 4/5 Food was honestly pretty darn good! I had the Eggs Benedict w/ hashbrowns. The baby had Scrambled Eggs & the French Toast. 4/5 because the french toast was dry & maybe a smidge over cooked.   Ambiance 4/5 Really small & tight squeeze! But everyone (including the patrons) were super kind & friendly...like a family!  Overall Experience 5/5 It was an awesome experience!   Total 4.5/5 (I'm gonna truncate (round up) to 5 Stars because Yelp doesn't do half points.)  Bottom Line... I'd definitely go back & I'd definitely recommend to a friend!"}
{"text":"Tight quarters and tightly knit community. Our server was friendly and it seemed more than three quarters of the customers were regulars. Portions were more than generous and kids menu was extremely affordable. Friendly atmosphere, good comfort food and worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great little hidden local spot.  I arrived before my breakfast date and the server got my ready with coffee and the menu.  My coffee cup was never empty.  This is a huge plus in my breakfast world.  I ordered with breakfast sandwich with bacon substituted for the ham and hash browns extra crispy.  This was such a simple comfort food breakfast that I could have easily cooked for myself at home, but instead the staff here made it for me and it was even better. This is truly a tiny little place with as many tables as possible pushed in there.  So if you don't like seeing what your neighbor is eating, you might try someplace else.  I personally loved making conversation about what they ordered for breakfast. Love 40th Street Cafe and can't wait to try it for lunch."}
{"text":"40th Street Cafe is a delightful place for home cooking. I was looking for good meatloaf and I found it! I will return for another dinner. Tina was a delightful server. She took my dietary restriction into consideration and suggested I have the hash browns with my meatloaf. A good suggestion."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict were good not great. But the staff was very friendly and attentive. Good american breakfast place. Close quarters for seating, reminds me of being on a ship. That's a good thing, because the quality of service also is cruise like. I will be back."}
{"text":"The owners and staff are very friendly and the food is great. Straightforward American fare, nicely done and at a good price. ALWAYS crowded and the tables are close together, so don't expect privacy, rather revel in the atmosphere and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I probably wouldn't have come here but for some reason I was reading the Yelp reviews and bookmarked this place. Checked off. Seen this place before and very very unassuming cafe in the strip mall.   We walk in and not sure what to expect. One of the waitress tells us to just take a table. So we sit down and there is crumbs on the table. Wife is freaking out (Scottsdale woman)  hahaha. One of the customers gets up and says I will get that cleaned up for you. Man is this place different. It seems something like the 60's or maybe like home. Waitress are just talking to the customers. Joking and everything. Just like home. Not your normal cafe.   I ordered the ultimate skillet. It had home potatoes, bacon, ham, sausage, onions, peppers with eggs on top with a side of English muffin. I really love home potatoes. I thought it was pretty good. Tasty, huge portion and filling. Not bad.   My wife for the Caesars chicken salad. This was very very different salad than other places we visited. Nice chunks of chicken, bacon, and egg. I was able to sneak a few bites and it was really good. It comes with Texas toast. My wife really liked the salad and toast. Usually she doesn't eat the bread with her salad but not today. She really like it.   As for the service, these servers are like your family. Seemed like your aunts or something. Take you order, fills you water glasses and coffee but never asked how everything is cause it's seems like home. Like family. Very homie place.   Only talking at this place was with the waitresses. My wife was a little uncomfortable cause it's such a small place that everyone hears your conversations so no one talks too much but with staff.   I liked the place. Huge menu. Let's put it this was family atmosphere (your treated like family), good food, huge portions. If you come here just be ready for a different environment. Loved it that on the walls are pictures of veterans. Leave your Scottsdale attitude out the door and just enjoy this different cafe. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong - I enjoy a hole-in-the-wall sorta place. But I also expect the food to outshine the location, ya know?  First, let me say there was nothing -wrong- with the food.  The omelet was not under or overcooked - but it was just bland.  Personally, I like my omelets to have a little browning and caramelization and these were just typical and plain.  The coffee wasn't very good - it tasted a little burnt, in fact, and I left not very culinarily satisfied.  I can appreciate the unique look and feel (cramped as it is), and can tell there are a bunch of regulars whom the staff know by name, and there is a good \"vibe\" to the place.  But without the food to back it up, I doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent amount of simple delicious breakfast food at a great price, this is the place for you! I've been here a few times now and it's now my go to diner when I just want some simple classic American breakfast food. It can get pretty crowded in the mornings, so if you're there during peak breakfast hours expect to wait for a table. It's worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite breakfast place. No frills here--simple food that tastes great where they know their regulars. It's not much to look at but they serve some mean home style breakfasts. And they have both shredded and home style potatoes. The food is inexpensive and service is friendly. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Sherrie, Kim and Tina are the nicest servers in the west!!! Great atmosphere. Delicious ruben and potato salad. You can't go wrong here for lunch or breakfast"}
{"text":"Food is great and service is even better! I would recommend to anyone looking for a good place for breakfast. :)"}
{"text":"40th St. is a pretty good place to have breakfast on the weekend.. For those of you wanting a pretty place with pretty Scottsdale people, you won't feel at home here.   Thomas S. was right on with his review comparing it to Mel's Diner of TV sitcom fame. It's was great to see the attention the regulars get.  Now after reading the reviews I'll have to go back and try the pie!"}
{"text":"I've learned from Yelping that people who rate Denny's and Ihop as their most favorite breakfast places almost invariably rate places like 40th Street Cafe and Matt's Big Breakfast as \"bad\".  I'm sure the best lunch they ever had was McDonalds and their best dinner was Olive Garden.  Whatever.  Folks, this is not fast food, nor is it anywhere near gourmet food , it is what it is, a simple family local restaurant.  I have been there countless times and here are my observations:  1) Food Quality - tastes home made 2) Price - cheap 3) Staff - superb!!! 4) Variety - okay for a tiny family-owned local place 5) Overall - fast foodies will hate it.  Fantastic ... stay away so us locals can enjoy it  And OMG, those ppl who drop a star or two or three becasue they don't understand the decor ... full of yourselves maybe?  You go to restaurants for food, not what the owners hang on the wall.  Deal with it."}
{"text":"Great & friendly service & absolutely no wait time. The staff here seemed to know everyone in this hole in the wall cafe by name & it made for a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  They had a hearty breakfast menu with lots of options-- & healthy options too!  My husband ordered the eggs benedict, & I got the country fried steak skillet. I cant speak for his dish, but mine was amazing! My eggs were cooked just as I ordered & everything was perfectly cooked & seasoned. The portion of food was pretty large considering the cheap prices.  We left happy & full & I'm sure we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is always consistent and very delicious. The restaurant is filled with regulars, which makes it a home style feel. The girls that work there are the \"Best\" Homemade pies made by Peggy are yummy to say the least."}
{"text":"A great, family owned for 27+ years, open for breakfast and lunch only. Service is always friendly and attentive.Food is always great...A terrific neighborhood restaurant you'll want to go to often.Like Cheers, everyone seems to know each other"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with Hubby and Little Man today. I can't say enough how much we love this place! Even when there's a wait, you don't have to wait too long and the service is very good. The regulars are friendly with our son and the food is awesome! I usually get the machaca and eggs, or a tuna melt on a bagel. They have the best fries ever! The kids' meals are inexpensive, they bring crayons and paper, and give them cookies at the end of the meal. Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices. This place is the neighborhood restaurant you may remember from your childhood; a great place to feel at home, to have a great breakfast, to enjoy a good sandwich. The staff are as user friendly as the food. The ambiance is simple, American, and kept clean."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I have found in az. Everything is homemade and has big portions with super low prices. I tell everyone about it and describe it as your grandma type cooking with waitress that have been there forever a real true diner joint that I love so much! Open at 5am which is another bonus since I work nights but wish it was 24/7 like. Country boys down street cause if be there all time if that was case with my schedule. Definitely an awesome place that I would recommend for anyone looking for delicious and cheap home cooked comfort food nothing fancy about it just good ol diner"}
{"text":"Food is great. Good home-style cooking. Fast, fast, fast service. They need a bigger place as it does get crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"Our usual place was packed so we checked Yelp and found this place. It's not much to look at really. A definite hole in the wall kinda place. Which are the best!  The staff was super friendly and the food was very good.  We thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"I totally expect to see Mel Sharpel's slinging hash in the kitchen with Alice, Flo and Vera, in those cute waitress outfits, tending to the eclectic brood of diners. And while the fictional characters from my past aren't here, you will find some REAL characters. My favorite is the older couples who don't speak to each other but instead read the newspaper. And the trucker guy who says things like \"Thanks little lady\". Not to be rude, I just batted my eyelashes and said, \"Why you're welcome trucker man.\"  All the servers are women who know their regulars names and what they want. Without fail. Though I\"m not much of a pie guy (insert homo joke here), people line up for Peggy's Pies. Me? I'm all about breakfast on the weekends and anything with gravy. Come for the meatloaf, chicken fried chicken or the biscuits but stay for the pie. It's like taking a trip to the midwest without the cavity search at Sky Harbor."}
{"text":"Maybe four stars. Maybe five stars. Can't decide. Guess I'll just have to come back again and again to figure it out.  It's easy to drive by this little gem. It's wedged in a strip mall between a pet groomer and a pack and ship store. You'll likely miss the \"cafe\" signage your first time here, but your persistence will be rewarded. It's been hiding here for 21 years!  Very small, with a great Midwestern family sort of vibe. Owner is named Peggy. Friendly waitresses who know the names of all their regulars. But don't worry, they'll be friendly to you as well. And their names are printed on their shirts, so you can call them by name if you'd like. Walk on in and seat yourself.  Look for a clipboard posted outside on a column to sign yourself in during busy times.  Tables are squeezed into a very tight space, really my only complaint, with no table seating more than four. But they'll move tables around for you if you're a bigger party. My \"neighbors\" this day included a dad with a preschooler, a couple of Iowa snowbirds, and some millennials dining after a workout. All friendly.  And kid friendly! Crayons. Kids Meals start at $1.50, although $2.95 is the likely amount to be spent. But the big win, at least according to the five and six year old who often accompany me out, is the chocolate chip cookie on a stick you receive if you finish your meal. What could be better than topping off a pancake breakfast with a chocolate chip cookie? Well...  No, they're not dog friendly, even with limited outside seating. Don't judge, though. It's easy to understand why there have been past problems with both a dog groomer and a veterinarian located next door.  Oh yes, the adult food. I can really only speak to their breakfasts, which I love. Look for the specials posted on a whiteboard above a cooler in the back of the cafe. Great breakfast deals M-F until 11:00. Then a lunch special kicks in.   They don't know my name yet, but I suspect they will soon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! It is the closest thing to a true diner Arizona and Phoenix has. This place has always been my go to. Great food, great service! They are a family there. The food is pretty basic: traditional eggs, bacon, pancakes etc and standard burgers, salads etc for lunch. Food is always consistent. Comes out hot every time. There is a reason this place has been around as long as it has!"}
{"text":"What a great find and thanks to Yelp! its small, but food was good and just the right amount and at a great price. Will definitely be heading here again even if its out of my way for breakfast. They have lunch and dinner too, menu looks good, so I'll have to try them for lunch and dinner too."}
{"text":"I have probably been here 100 times in the last 10 years!!! This is THE breakfast spot to go in Phoenix. Location is great, price is even greater.  If you go on the weekends be prepared to stand outside an wait because there WILL be a wait everybody who is anybody knows about Peggy's aka 40th street cafe.   Breakfast - The best ever!!! Biscuits and gravy are rediculously good, and the waffles are amazing. They only have 1 waffle maker so if one table orders two waffles they will serve you a half at a time which is cool i think.  Dinner - FISH FRY and chicken fried steak!!!!!! Thats all i am at liberty to speak of since those are the best two diner items ive had.   Wear Cardinals gear during football season and you get free coffee!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great breakfast cafe. Here are the perks:  #1 CHEAP  #2 Great Gravy  #3 Tasteful Bacon  #4 Kind and Fast Service   Here are the reasons for a solid 4 stars:   #1 Biscuits were VERY heavy  #2 House potatoes had no taste  #3 The restaurant lacked decorations.   Overall, a great experience and we will be back for occasional breakfast. It seems like there were a lot of \"regulars\" when we went, which was nice!"}
{"text":"Happy camper...enjoyed an excellent eggs benedict...they got it right! Cozy cafe, excellent service and friendly people. Everybody knows everyone in this place. Struck up conversations with the regulars while there. The coffee cup was never empty. Had the home fries as a side.  They were ok...needed a bit more flavor.  I may try hash browns next time. They have daily specials as well. Prices are reasonable.  One of the few places that opens at 5:00 a.m."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The spinach and feta cheese omelette with a little tomato added in was delicious. I will definitely be back. The price was right, the service was efficient and the crowd was friendly. A regular suggested I try the French toast next time."}
{"text":"Love the staff the eggs and bacon were perfect. This is the type of place I'd recommend to bring a family to eat at. I am giving it a 5 great experience."}
{"text":"As has been said before, this is a tiny place full of regular customers.  The portions are generous and the price certainly is right.  The waitress wouldn't stop asking my 2 year old what the \"Easter Bunny\" was bringing her.  It got kind of old especially since we don't worship Bunnies at our house.  Seating was tight and we got to sit next to a guy having breakfast with his girlfriend and happy to say that his wife was home sleeping.  I wouldn't say that that the clientele all lived in the trailer park but some do.  If we go again we'll try and get there early before the crowds.  The bacon was especially tasty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast on the weekend.  This place is truly a gem. Having been here for over a decade, they know what they're doing and how to cook a great meal. There may be a slight wait on a busy weekend, but it's totally worth it. The breakfasts are delicious, very well portioned, and come at a very affordable price. It's no frill, but has a great, friendly cafe environment."}
{"text":"Love this little cafe. I love their coffee and Sherry is the best waitress ever. It's best to have a late breakfast because it's always packed and very very busy if you go earlier. Try all the breakfast specials because I can't find a favorite they're all just so fresh and delicious and the portions are wonderful"}
{"text":"What a great hole-in-the-wall spot for breakfast or lunch!  I got the healthy omelet, and it was excellent.  The service was super personable, friendly, and fast.  I'll be eating here frequently!"}
{"text":"Just got back from breakfast at the 40th Street Cafe.  For a Tuesday morning, it was BUSY.  Only a couple tables open.  My waitress Sherrie was a total delight; I never saw a smile leave her face.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant (75 cents extra, totally worth it), sub bacon instead of ham, and sub scrambled eggs instead of the over hard egg just like I saw in a picture here on yelp.  It was great!  Loads of bacon, the eggs were great (not dry like other breakfast places like to serve you).  The hashbrowns were good - although not seasoned at all, like another reviewer noted, so I had to salt them myself... but that seems to be a norm for breakfast places like these, since a lot of their clientele is of the older generation who can't handle salt.  Lots of regulars here, lots of people just sitting drinking coffee and reading the paper.  Although one woman was totally rude and annoying - my waitress was taking the order of a woman sitting at the table next to me, and a woman at the table across the aisle threw her wadded-up straw wrapper at the waitress while she was taking the order - it almost landed in the full pot of coffee on the table - then apologized to the customer getting her order taken, saying she was trying to hit the waitress, and let out the most ungodly hyena-like guffaw I've ever heard.  I get that you know the waitress and you're trying to be funny, but jesus christ.  Have some respect and try to contain yourself.  She was at least 60 years old btw.  ANYWAY, overall it was a great experience and I had a good time just sitting there eating watching the price is right on their 20-year-old television.  I'll be heading back there for sure."}
{"text":"Want to feel like you're in a small town?  Come here.  Why?  Because there is such an amazing sence of community here.  Sit up at the counter, try a slice of one of Peggy's famous homade pies and chat with the waitress.  She's better than any bartender.  Or better yet, bring some family or friends and sit down at one of the tables and order some real food.  Real food because it's all homemade.  From the biscuits to the chicken fried steak to the smothered chicken to the meatloaf or some real get you going breakfast food.  From scratch food at practically fast food prices.  It's insane.   The waitresses are amazing.  Our 3rd time there we had the same waitress we had the 1st time.  She remembered our order - including a special request for gravy on the side.  Before we said it.  And it had been weeks since she saw us.  We decided it was kinda freaky - but amazingly cool at the same time. They are all amazingly nice in a down home kind of way.  Ya might get called hun.  Or sweetie.  I've seen regulars get their hair scruffled.    One time we were there I saw the wait staff pull out the white pages to try to find the phone number for one of their regulars.  They were concerned that they hadn't seen him yet that week.  They found out he was sick, and one of the women said she'd bring him some food on her way home.  Right there and then - they had my business.  I may not live in the area anymore, but we try to make it over there at least a few times a year.  Who wouldn't want to support service like that?  When you go - be aware of their hours.  These are small town too.   M-F 5am-9pm Saturday - 5am-3pm Sunday 6am-3pm"}
{"text":"I have no reason not to give this place five stars. I walked in for the first time and sat at the counter. The regulars were sitting there and struck up a conversation with me. I asked them about the food. They had nothing but good things to say. I had the chicken fried steak or I guess it's country fried steak it was absolutely delicious! There was a lot of food more than enough for me! The eggs were cooked perfectly! This is definitely a place I will return to. Although it is small I absolutely loved the family feel!"}
{"text":"First time here and I would definitely go back. Great friendly service with a real local feel like everybody already knows you. I felt like I was walking into Cheers where everybody knows your name. The staff was just super friendly, in a good mood, and talking to everybody. My order was pretty difficult because I'm always customizing things, so it's usually a crap shoot if it comes out right. Everything was perfect, hot, and tasted really good.  Great little small local cafe spot for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Appears to be run by vets possibly cooked in military food is good and prices great. Very friendly atmosphere. Waitress's knew 85% of the customers and what they liked to eat. Very patriotic. Check it out.."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food for way cheap! WARNING: Only odd thing is that when you order an omelet with cheese, they put the cheese on the top, outside. So you have to ask for the sheese inside when you order.  Other than that, I'm becoming a regular. My husband and one of the servers always joke about the Cardinals (she's a huge fan) and when he went with my sister once without me, he said he got a few funny looks. THis is a great place for basic breakfast faves. Nothing fancy (you're all sort of crammed in there)  but really comfortable and good food."}
{"text":"Very good chorizo breakfast converted to a burrito and mediocre biscuits & gravy.   Service was excellent and the staff was very nice.  Prices were very reasonable.  Small place with a few outside tables, great little neighborhood diner."}
{"text":"Our usual place was packed so we checked Yelp and found this place. It's not much to look at really. A definite hole in the wall kinda place. Which are the best!  The staff was super friendly and the food was very good.  We thoroughly enjoyed it and will be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and they have the best biscuits and gravy. The eggs are never overcooked and the bacon never undercooked. The community atmosphere is reminiscent of small town diner familiarity. You can't help but feel it as soon as you walk in the door. I'm always running into friends who love this place as much as I do. The waitresses and staff are always friendly and accommodating when I come in with large groups of people. It is definitely  worth the wait on the weekends. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"A little, and I do mean little, hole in the wall diner that reminds me of a Florida retirement restaurant in the community where my dad lives. Military gear all over the walls, older crowd, and a very extensive menu. Lots of choices here. I had breakfast. The food was nothing to write home about but not bad either. Service was great for how busy they were and the meal was cheap. The tomatoes were not good, spoiled/sour but that seems to be the trend  in Arizona.  I would go back for a lunch option but to be honest I would not go out of my way to eat here. It is far from my neighborhood. I only stopped by because I was running an errand nearby."}
{"text":"A friend and I have been wanting to try this place for months. Finally had the opportunity. Arrived about 8:30 on a glorious October morning. Found the inside of this tiny strip mall establishment sold out. Instead of waiting we opted to sit at one of the three tables outside.  A gentleman brought our menus and took our drink order. He never cracked a smile, seemed a little put off that we wanted to sit outside. Since we had very little contact with him, no points off.  Our waitress brought our drinks after a few short minutes. She made up for Mister Grumpy pants short comings.  We came to 40th St for one reason. The Pork Roll, aka Taylor Ham. I ordered the Pork roll, egg and cheese on grilled sourdough with home fries. My dining companion ordered hers on a bagel with hash browns.  Breakfast arrived after about 10 minutes. Maybe a few less maybe a few more.  Picture perfect. Bread perfectly toasted. Cheese melty and gooey, egg slightly over hard. My sandwich only could have been better if the egg would have been a little soft or even a little runny. Not complaining though. Potatoes cooked perfectly too. Crispy on the outside and fluffy soft on the inside.   Even though we sat outside and it was a pain for our waitress our service never lacked. Drinks and coffee re-filled and she returned several times to check on us.  We our westsiders and drove the 30 minutes to try 40th St Cafe and we do not regret that decision.  Highly recommend, especially any east coast transplants that are craving a PR, egg and cheese. I can't wait to go back to try something else from the menu!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not my favorite place for breakfast.  I hated the wicked crammed layout of this place and the decor is just confusing.  I don't get the diamond-plate on the walls and I definitely don't understand the down home country kitschy decorations up on shelves.  Whatever, it's about the food right?  I ordered a bacon and cheese omelet with hashbrowns and I was a little less than impressed.  The omelet was pretty crispy on the edges, and that is only appropriate when I order fried eggs.  The bacon was okay, but too overdone.  There wasn't enough cheese and the cheese that was there was just blah.  The hashbrowns just tasted like potatoes.  They needed a ton of salt for me to eat them.  I thought the portions, while enough for me, were a bit small for the price.  Pretty much everywhere else I can get a heaping plate of breakfast food for under 7 bucks.    I've had better.  That's really all there is.  The service was nice enough but I just don't really care for this place.  I really felt like I was eating in some po-dunk town with all the strange \"characters\" dining here.  At least it didn't make me sick."}
{"text":"Although the restaurant is small, we had a great breakfast and the waitress was super nice. I will say that they had a bit older crowd. Prices were very reasonable also. I would recommend if you don't like the chains!"}
