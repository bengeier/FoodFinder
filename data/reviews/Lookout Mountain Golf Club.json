{"text":"Nice golf course over all.. Had a good time with my buddies.. Greens were in good shape.."}
{"text":"Over-seeded in Nov made greens slower but very puttable. Fairways perfect and NOT cart-path-only which is a great thing. Priced right ($50 after 1 pm).  Good hole variety in bunkering, elevation, and risk-reward. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The course was worth the money.  Overall conditions were very plush.  There are lots of sand traps strategically placed specifically for my game.  I managed to find every single one.  I will gladly come back after I work on my swing a little more."}
{"text":"Love this course. Play it every time I'm in the Phoenix area because the price is right, the staff is friendly, and the course is always in great shape. 

Last time I was here I was paired with the head instructor that was giving a playing lesson for six holes. Super nice guy and made the round that much more enjoyable. 

This is what I think of when I think resort style golf course."}
{"text":"Challenging greens with unexpected slopes and fairways with tons of surprises. We played the forward tees but the championship tours looked really challenging!  Love the lunch that you call in at the 8th hole and then eat on your way to the 10th.  Not very much water on the grounds. 

Overall we had a great experience and we would definitely play this course again or even bring friends to it."}
{"text":"The golf conditions (fairway grass and greens) are never consistent. I blame that on ownership and the Superintendent. The pro shop guys are always very nice and friendly, that's not the same of the old codger's that are in the starter's room near the practice area. They are typically rude, short and they act like you're bothering them from getting in their free round of golf. The practice facility is above average. In my opinion it's not worth more than $50 to play the course during the winter months, there's better deals out there for the condition of the course your getting."}
{"text":"I've played Lookout Mountain Golf Club several times, but have never written a review. The course is SO much fun, offers a wide range of shots and shot types, and the course is always in great shape. The fairways are pure, the greens hold and are smooth, and the pace of play is always on point. The staff is great, too, from the guys in the golf shop to the player's assistant on the course. Just an enjoyable and memorable experience from start to finish. Oh, and 10 tee... What a great hole! It doesn't get much better than the experience you will have at Lookout Mountain Golf Club."}
{"text":"We golfed on Saturday and Sunday of President's Day weekend.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  They made sure I understood how to check in and where to go.  The course was beautiful.  The greens are in excellent condition.  The practice range is included in the price and you hit off grass.  
The course was interesting and fair.  It forced you to focus, but it didn't punish you too bad for an errant hit.  I also appreciated the 10 minute stagger. That allowed us to finish 18 holes even though we bought a twilight tee time.  
I would definitely return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite courses in the Phoenix area. Love the elevation changes on the back 9. Staff is always great. Start of back 9 has a little hut for lunch that you place the order on 8. Usually a little bit of a wait on 10, but with the view you can't get mad..."}
{"text":"Beautiful course. Fun & challenging. OK price. Friendly staff. Great course condition. Convenient location from anywhere in the valley. We'll return."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite  courses . Greens and fairways  are in great shape . The course  is convenient .the food at the halfway  house is excellent.  The course  can be a little  pricey.  The greens are very tricky . Their are some outstanding  views on the course.  Some times the pace of play is slow"}
{"text":"We golfed twice here this week and love this course. It has some really nice advantages from the forward tees and the ball goes a mile on the dry surfaces. Staff is nice and there are great views. 

Tee off before 8 am for a cooler round in the summer. Plenty of drinking water on the course.

Great pricing through GolfNow. Sometimes the pro shop can natch it other times they won't. Guess it depends who is working the register."}
{"text":"There are fancier golf courses but overall this place is a low 5 star golf course.  It is challenging, beautiful and fun to play golf here.  It is confusing for first timers as you first go the club pro shop which is not connected to the golf course.  But once you get through that, it is a blast to have access to free range balls and to practice the short game.  The holes are nicely landscaped and the greens were cut short for a true roll.  Some of the signature holes were intimidating but so fun to figure out where to place the ball.  We got a huge discount with a golfnow golf caddy deal for $50 which quickly sold out.  I think this place is worth their full price fee but it was so nice to play for less."}
{"text":"Came today to simply use the putting green and chipping green and was told that I have to pay $25. 

There were a total of 5 people there. I wasn't bothering anyone nor was I costing them any extra money. I play this course all the time but after today I will no longer give my money to this course. 

It's not nice enough to pay money to use the putting and chipping greens.

After this experience I drove down the street and used the facilities at the 500 club instead."}
{"text":"Lookout Mountain Golf Club is average golf course for the money. They have good views and few challenge holes. Troon has done a good job managing this property. Plenty of water fountains and beer carts for the hot summer days."}
{"text":"Had a great round here a few weeks back! This was my first golf experience on the west coast and it was awesome. The hills, the views, the lack of trees.... A+. The sheer amount of space for me to still lose the ball... F, but that's more of a reflection of my own poor golfing than of the course, of course. Although we arrived a bit late, carts and bags were ready for us to head towards the range immediately and we were on the first tee within 15 minutes. Once we teed off (poorly), the course brought us all kinds of happiness and sadness; there were hills, dog-legs, beer breaks, cigar breaks, club breaks, balls in yards, long short games, backs thrown, cactus pics... and so much more. Overall, a wonderful day on a beautiful course. I only wish I was better at golf to really challenge the course, instead of the course constantly calling me challenged (not PC, course!). Would love to come back!  

Protip: you better play all 18. Turning around at 9 is a 3 mile trip back to the clubhouse.
Bonus: Cool little clubhouse bar to laugh about your game or kill some time before your tee time"}
{"text":"Great guys at the pro shop!! I think we bought them out of the new Nike colored golf belts! Thanks so much for the hook up and getting me in and out quick when buying the pink belt for my wedding day!!!"}
{"text":"The course and surrounding scenery were beautiful.  My complaint is that I'm staying at the resort and have played multiple rounds only to just find out that others, not staying at the resort, have been paying $50 per round less than me by booking at Golfnow.com. I would think the club house would be upfront on pricing with a patron that is staying at the resort.  Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"Foursome all ended up with 15-20 shots more than usual. This is not a user friendly resort course because of narrow fairways, blind shots, numerous bunkers, and tricked up slopes to the rough. Plan to lose balls. Condition was good, greens true and pace at 4 hours. Unless you are a super accurate target golfer, though, you have MANY better golf course options in the valley of the sun."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy this course. It is challenging but not overly hard. A bonus of getting free range balls with your round is always nice. Many shots from the fairways that you take are not on a flat lie. However this time of year, if your course isn't in decent shape, you get a lower mark. Their greens are in pretty good shape but I found myself hitting on dead fairway or hitting from spotty grass around the greens. When you are not rewarded for hitting the ball in the fairway, it is a little hard to have fun. I can tell that they are trying to help by overwatering but this leads to the other problem of soggy grass. This is also a problem on the course and I often found myself hitting in a wet lie when I shouldn't have been. I have played here many times and probably will again."}
{"text":"Great location some fantastic elevated tees. Expensive during winter months. Great clubhouse for drinks after. 
Good driving range where balls are included in green fees."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to golfing and our expectations were high!! It's Arizona! Wow... what a disappointment! We have never been to a course where the people working there (2 men) were so miserable! The course was nice but no one said hello or greeted us in a friendly manner or even gave us a quick chat about the course! We left there and thought to ourselves... what a sucky place! Obviously will never come back !! We went to a nicer and friendlier place in Scottsdale. Will defintely go back there!"}
{"text":"This is the resort course for the Pointe Tapatio Cliffs Hilton.  

Not an easy trek by any stretch of the imagination, but nevertheless a playable course for virtually anyone.  Desert golf is great in that low-index golfers can be challenged by the requirement to play target golf.  High handicap or newer golfers should enjoy the fact that the desert conditions make it very easy to find errantly hit balls and place them back in the fairway.  (Don't try to hit off the desert dirt unless you hate your clubs.)

There are a couple difficult forced carries but as long as you pick the correct tee box, they are all manageable.  Course conditions are always immaculate.  (I've probably played here 20 times over the past 5 years.)  The greens fees are a little on the high side, but then again this is resort golf and that is to be expected.

My only complaint is the service.  The guys who work the carts need to grow up and act a little more mature.  I get tired of standing there watching towel fights or two guys arguing over who can hit a golf ball farther.  I don't know why, but this seems to have gotten worse in the past year."}
{"text":"Nice hidden gem. Fairways were okay. Some fun elevated tee boxes. Would play again.  Adding more words so yelp doesn't post as a tip. Not much I can say. Worth 50 but not a hundred."}
{"text":"called 1 hour ahead. asked about driving range, was given info about pricing over the phone. 
thought i got lost - gps took me to actual range, needed to go to golf shop. called for directions, talked to 1 person, transferred to another \"more familiar\" with course. he gave us directions. drove literally 5 minutes, arrived and was told range was closed!
i was INCREDULOUS! told them i had JUST called and was told sorry, range closed early because frost on grass delayed scheduled mowing that morning. he knew nothing about why no one on staff communicated that.
not happy with answer, called again, transferred to someone at golf shop. relayed info, heard frost story again. asked AGAIN WHY NO ONE TOLD ME, was informed they use an answering service.
asked why no one at course bothered to tell answering service - which i had NO WAY of knowing i wasnt actually talking to someone at the course. just got rehash of excuses.
drove over 45 minutes to get to course only to ne turned away. NO EXCUSE FOR THAT! not when i called several times to check on using the range."}
{"text":"A decent mountain-style course.  The first 6 holes are fairly straightforward, the next 12 get nasty!

Do Not Plan To Walk This Course!  Get the cart!

The ladies who work here are all fantastic and very pleasant.  The males are all uber A-Types who are pissed at the world because they work at a Golf Course.  The starter we met was a total doucher.

Go if you get a rate.  Not worth full price."}
{"text":"Just played this course today, played from the whites because I wasn't striking it well yesterday. I truly enjoyed this course. I have nothing bad to say about it except that I wish it were closer to me.  The staff were very friendly especially Jim( from Iowa and a Bears fan). Thanks for your insight.
   Let me start by saying, this is not a course one should walk. The elevation changes would really punish you. Tee to greens were in great shape. Well maintained fairways, some narrow but are aesthetically pleasing. Not a lot of water but plenty of bunkers which are well placed. The greens keeper must have been mad because the pin placements were challenging. Made it fun though.  The greens were very smooth, fast and true. 
   Lots of elevation changes which made for awesome scenery. Loved the view from tee box 10.  I would play this again for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent track! It's short from the tips at 6,500yds but it is extremely difficult. 

The greens always roll like lighting and are true. All wedge shots stick. This is a risk/reward course with a lot more risk. The fairways are narrow and the greens are on the smaller end.

The course layout is 10/10."}
{"text":"I'm certainly biased since this is so close to my house, but this is my favorite course to play in Phoenix. It's consistently in great shape, the staff is amazing and it's got some of the best views in the Valley. The course is challenging and there's lots of elevation, but it's not as long as some of the other resort courses in Phoenix. The bonus is that Troon took over a year or two ago, so you get Troon points, too!"}
{"text":"Played this course for the first time yesterday and I loved it. It was a fun and challenging course. Greens were in great shape as well. The sights were amazing as you play through the mountains. The staff was very friendly and helpful. When you finish playing they give you an ice cold towels that has a mango scent to them.... Loved that! I will be returning to play very soon."}
{"text":"I have not even swung a golf club in more than 2 months...how does that even happen?

So, in an effort to make myself look as foolish as possible, I decided that I a needed to tee it up at Lookout Mountain, the resort course at the Pointe Hilton at Tapatio Cliffs, for my comeback round:)

This sporty little course isn't very long (a little over 6500 yards from the tips), but don't let the lack of sheer yardage fool you... the course is a challenge, esp. played from the tips.

The driving areas are all relatively tight (you should only be thinking \"driver\" on 4 holes...all the rest need more precision than a driver will allow...at least for me:)

There are pretty views to distract you and claustrophobic tee boxes and sight lines to worry you, so that adds to the fun:)

There's definitely a reason this course is routinely ranked in the top 25 in Arizona and the top 400 in the US:)

Lookout Mountain has a very nice practice range near the first tee (which, in this interesting layout, is a mile away from the resort, main clubhouse and the bar:(

The course was in good shape (they have had problems from time to time with burnout on the greens, but not apparently this year:)

Service is exactly what you would expect from a good resort course...all the staff call you sir and they cannot wipe your clubs down often enough...they bring ice towels out to you on the course...the beverage cart girls are all pleasant and friendly and they have a charming little snack shack at the 10th tee...the highest point at the Pointe:)

From there, it's an entertaining little tee shot from a cliff onto a sidewalk that will set the tone for your back nine:)

Sadly, in the only thing that I don't really like about this place, you can't  sit at the bar and watch vanquished golfers stagger off the 18th green (which is always part of the fun:)...there's a \"pro shack\"/starters house at the18th green/range complex, but that doesn't get the job done.

In an effort to really turn my comeback round into something really ugly, I hit exactly 21 range balls and rolled 5 putts to warm up...after more than 2 months of no play:)

But, it all worked out and I managed to play my way around Lookout Mountain in fairly good order.

Give Lookout Mountain a try...they have some good rates (now that summer is here) for this entertaining little layout:)

Oh, my round...78, from the tips...ice cold:) 

I am back, baby:)"}
{"text":"Nice course... Couldn't argue with the price, staff, overall set up.

Challenging for sure.

The first 5 or 6 holes are pretty easy and then it gets difficult.

I would play here again..."}
