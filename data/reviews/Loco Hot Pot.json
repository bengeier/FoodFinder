{"text":"I'm not generally a hot pot fan because it's better at home, but this place has great flavor, and lots of soup base options.

Hard place to find, didn't show up on Google or Yelp directly, guess mostly Asian crowd. It's not ayce, but either mini hot pot or by the lb.

They also have a few non hot pot dishes, I also got the sea weed salad and it was great. Definitely return if I'm in the area.

I think it's a interac or cash only place."}
{"text":"Finally we have a 'Stinky-Tofu' style mini hotpot place in Toronto!  Loved the stinky-tofu style hotpots back in Asia and also in some US cities Like Los Angeles, but haven't found a comparable one here in Toronto for the longest time.

This place must have just opened recently, because Yelp doesnt have its listing yet at the time of this review.  Located at the corner of the Food Basics plaza at Yonge and Cummer, it's hard to find them especially when their sign is really small compared to the other businesses in the plaza, just look for the red sign that says 'Hot Pot' and some Chinese writings beside it.  

Their menu are composed mostly of the signature miniature personal hotpots, with different ingredients and soup bases and spicy levels.  These are not AYCE style hotpots , and all the food comes already cooked in the hotpot when they bring it up to you, so you dont have to cook it yourself.  

The soup base flavors can be more salty and stronger flavored compared to other typical Chinese hot pot places though

We ordered the signature stinky tofu hotpot and the spicy tofu hotpot, the flavors are pretty good, very close to the flavours we've had back in Asia, the stinky tofu pot might be a bit on the salty side when the soups start to get boiled away by the little burner underneath.  

The stinky tofu does taste similar to how they are made in Asia, however the flavor is a bit more blend then the ones I've tasted in Asia,  but neverthrless this is good enough for me as there are not really any other places in Toronto that offers comparable flavors.

The dishes comes with some basic dipping sauces like sha cha sauce and sesame sauce, I had asked for Minced garlic and diced green onions, which they were happy to provide at no additional charge, you also get to choose rice or noodle to go with the hotpot.

Apparently they also offer a-la-carte ordering for hotpot ingredients based on weight, and there's a chilled buffet style cooler by the wall that you can order from. 

Overall pretty good experience in terms of authenticity of the Food flavors,  it seems they have just opened and still getting their acts together, I would definitely come back again,"}

{"text":"Nice to have a hotpot place that is not all you can eat.  The taste here is pretty good but really heavy on the salt.  Service was terrible even by Chinese standards.  One person serving the entire room.  For most of our meal we were the only table but the servers back is constantly toward us because shes at the display of uncooked food working on takeout orders.  So for basic things like water I had to walk up to her to ask for it.  

Midway through the meal we asked her for an order of egg noodle (yes walked up to her to ask for it).  She communicates to the kitchen one order of egg noodle. After not coming for a while we followed up.  She went to the kitchen, then went to the uncooked food area and grabbed us an instant noodle.  'Isn't this instant noodle?' we asked.  She said 'no its egg noodle'.  We walk up to the uncooked food area, label says instant noodle.  So either she did not know what egg noodle was or she was trying to fool us.  I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say she does not know what shes doing.

As I said, this place is heavy on the salt.  The end of the meal's experience is analogous to the opposite of really needing to go to the bathroom.  We wanted water intake so badly we were getting antsy to get out of there.  The food was so salty that the sauce we dipped the food in would make it less salty.  Yes, satay sauce washed our food. By this time there were several tables so no chance we would get any service.  Paid, took their tip and bought drinks at Shoppers next door."}
