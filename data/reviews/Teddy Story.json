{"text":"Very cute little cafe ~ definitely a great place to tske pictured we cute and huge teddy bears"}
{"text":"The Earl Grey Rose milk tea is my favorite! They make it with David's tea leaves and add Rose syrup to it, it tastes so good and you can't get it elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Cute little café - shop near financial district. My little niece loves it plus it has a mini cinema playing some cartoons movie. I went there twice. On my first visit, I had hot chocolate. It looks appealing with some marshmallow, chocolate syrup, and sprinkles toppings. It was too sweet for me but I'm sure you can make a request to make it less sweet. For the second time, I had almond latte and my friend had a milk tea. It was excellent! From both visits, they didn't have a lot of selection for dessert. Only cupcakes, macaroons, and a cheese cake. However, the server told us that the cupcakes were not fresh and we can only order the macaroons and a cheese cake. I like that the server was being honest but I wish that there are more supply and more options for fresh dessert in the future. Overall it's a great experience and service, especially for the kids!"}
{"text":"Teddy bears are so cute!!! Got a pair of newly married teddy bear for my friend as a wedding gift! She loves it!"}
{"text":"I gone there to check it out the cafe i have been searching for a good place to relaxed all those bear is soooo adorable and cute. I order a roasted marshmallows drink from the cold is like hot coco. I enjoy the place. I'm gonna tell my friends about this place. Also I found out they open a month ago!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's the cutest little cafe and full of adorable teddy bears. I tried it on Ritual and got a delicious vanilla hazelnut white mocha latte with almond milk that was made with a bear design that was almost too cute to drink. I also ordered the dark chocolate cake and it was divine. Moist, airy, delicious and not overly sweet. The woman and man working behind the counter were both so friendly, helpful and accommodating. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This is honestly a very small but super cute café! Personally, I'm not a major fan of stuffed animals (I own a couple, but I'm not the type to go crazy over cute teddy bears), but I was still very amused and did some fangirling haha. The interior is filled with teddy bears, both large and small, and the tables and chairs resemble those of an outdoors patio.  They have a daily special, and on the day I went (Saturday), it was half price off an avocado smoothie. However, when I asked, the manager said that they had no avocado in stock because it wasn't in season. In return, she promised to provide any smoothie at half price. Just proves how great their customer service and café quality are! Since all their smoothies are made from fresh fruit, they are dedicated to providing the best smoothies. I really respected that :)  The manager continued to be friendly and helpful throughout, asking me to contact her if I had any questions. She also made true on her promise of providing all smoothies half price off.  In the end, I ordered a papaya smoothie (the cashier recommended it as they just got a fresh shipment yesterday), while my friend got a mango smoothie. Both were super fresh, but I preferred my friend's drink as it was less \"artificial\" in taste. There was an obvious taste of added sugar in my drink, though I still thoroughly enjoyed it because papaya + almond milk = match made in heaven.  I'm definitely coming here again! Great drinks, great service, great surroundings. Next time I might try their coffees, since they're so famous for their latte art!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend anyone who wants a calm place to go or simply loves stuffed bears. I went with my family here in winter 2017 and I even bought a bear. I love the fact you can dress up your own bear which I just had to do. There is an abundance of size choices for the Bears. There are 10 inch 12 inch 14inch bears and bear big enough to cuddle with before bedtime. The drinks and food are splendid. I hope anyone who reads this review stops by Teddy story after reading. I hope you enjoy this really cute cafe!"}
{"text":"Adorable decorations, especially if you're into Teddy Bears or plushies. I'm not but luckily for me the drinks and desserts are plain mouth watering and there's a projector in the back playing Tom and Jerry for some childhood throwback. Super nice workers too!"}
{"text":"Adorable and friendly, this cafe is unique with its main attraction - stuffed teddy bears! They even have a small cinematic wall that invites you with YouTube videos of Paddington Bear and other cute bear loops. They serve tea, coffee, mocha and matcha lattes, macarons and baked goods. The decor is somewhat old-world with their rustic Parisian affair to match with some of their  french-style pastries. Definitely one of a kind in the city."}
{"text":"This review is extremely overdue but I just simply LOVE going here with friends on a date. It is the perfect cute store to have brunch/afternoon tea/coffee with their pastries.  They have a large selection of drinks ranging from Organic Tea to Cofee drinks toReal Fruit Slushes. I love them all and I also love the fact that they have milk alternatives like Soy and Almond. A large majority of my friends are lactose intolerant or vegan so this is a huge plus.   I ordered the English Breakfast Milk Tea with Rose Water multiple times and I love it everytime because the barista's here are experts. They use thermometers for the right temperature of their hot drinks so they don't serve it too hot or too cold and they will artistically draw flowers or leaves on your latte's which I'm very grratful for.  The mini dessert bar options can have different cakes everyday but they seem to always have their supply of macarons in. I've had their Tirimisu cake and for me it was on the bland side lacking expresso flavour. I've also had their Chocolate Mousse Cake which seemed to have a red velvet cake filling and i LOVED every bite. For the sake of ettiquette, I told myself not to lick the plate.   The bonus of this cafe is that you can choose to pay first for your food or pay as you're leaving and I really love this option as I prefer to pay when Im done gobbling up their entire store.  The jazz and classical music going in the background suits the theme of this place and it adds to the already causal yet relaxing atmosphere. I feel like im off in the Teddy bear version of Europe somewhere either in France or Belgium. If you go all the way back into the cafe they have cute retro shows being projected onto the back wall like Hamtaro.  Now save the best for last... THE BATHROOM. It's HUGE. It'l has a drain on floor incase it floods!!! Always has enough toilet paper! The abundancy of paper towels!!! SUPER CLEAN. And omg. They have eco friendly hand soaps and lotion which I believe have oatmeal, shea butter, argan oil, the best products that could soothe dying hands.   If I could live here I would. Thank you staff for always being so friendly and wonderfully accommodating!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest cafe ever, it operate as a teddy bear shop and a cafe. The store atmosphere is cozy and calm, perfect for studying and catching up with friends. Decorations include teddy bear clothing and a variety of different size teddy bears. The menu offers a variety of drinks of refreshments. I tried the toasted marshmallow mocha which was really good and the barista does cafe arts on hot beverages as well. In addition, they have a wide selection of cakes and sweets including macaroon. I have tried the chocolate mousse, mango, caramel and raspberry cakes. The caramel cake was the best out of all 4 of them. Prices are reasonable and fair. Overall, this cafe deserves a five star because of its service, atmosphere, environment, and the quality of its food and beverages."}
{"text":"Get ready for a super detailed review because this was one of the highlights of my trip to Toronto. This was on my itinerary prior to my trip and I was super stoked I got a chance to visit!  Teddy Story is a little cafe with adorable bear decorations straight from a little girl's fantasy. Its a teddybear store in the front half, and a cafe towards the back. In the front part of the store, there is a giant menu on the wall with a wide variety of drinks! I ordered a coffee milkshake and a earl gray rose milk tea. The dessert I ordered resembled a slice of watermelon but was really a raspberry cake with cream. There is also a giant screen portraying the adventures of Paddington, along with a super cute soundtrack that is played through the store. After taking a few sips of my drink, I wandered toward the teddy bear section. They have pre-made teddies with clothes already picked out, along with special collectible items! Additionally, there is an option to \"make\" your own teddy! You can choose from different sizes ranging from 5\"-8\" and up to about 14\". Each teddy is designed differently so they have different price points. There is also clothing / shoes you can pick out for your teddy based off of what size they are. I chose a 8\" teddy ($21.99) and picked out a hoodie ($10.50) along with some cute sneakers ($9.99). My total came out to be around $50 ish dollars. To be honest, I rather purchase a custom teddy from Teddy Story rather than a big company like \"Build-a-bear\" because the quality is much better, and the price points are pretty much the same. The person working helped me pick out the outfit and recommended me items off the food menu. Overall, I had a great experience and I left the cafe with a new cuddly friend!"}
{"text":"We drove by and saw the beautiful teddy before dinner so we decided to stop by to check it out. Entering the cafe on a cold winter day brightens up a dull evening and reminds me of being back in Asia. The screen was playing my favourite Doraemon, the staff was friendly and helpful. I ordered the lavender green tea and it was very nicely done. This is definitely worth a try as is a very nice independent cafe and there was one special table where you can sit beside two big teddies!"}
{"text":"So cute! The vanilla hazelnut mocha was delicious, and the surprise teddy bear art did not hurt at all! :D The cake was delicious too! Also got the chance to try the Earl grey lavender the latte; a little sweet, but still delicious! I love the atmosphere and all the teddies are one of a kind and unique from each other. I would love to buy a bear or two from them!"}
{"text":"Probably the cutest cafe I've ever been to in Toronto! The decor is so pretty and lovely. But if you don't like girly things and teddy bears you're going to want to skip this one haha. The lady working there was really informative and helped us decide on our drinks (they have a pretty interesting drink menu and some unique drinks!) She also draws cute latte art for you as well! They also have some cute pastries and cakes to choose from. 11/10 instagrammable cafe!"}
{"text":"Ordered a toasted marshmallow mocha - it was just the right amount of sweetness   The cafe is super quiet - would make a great place to do quiet work or catch up with friends.   Cute teddy bears everywhere"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more stars because this place is so cute, but their drinks are really hit and miss.  The main draw of this place is that it has adorable decor, and also functions as a teddy bear shop. You can get your coffee or tea AND a soft toy in one place, in about 5 minutes. It's definitely a place to take cute photos and sit for a while or pick up a gift for your girlfriend.  Unfortunately the drinks themselves are very mediocre quality. I think as long as you avoid anything sweet or floral sounding, it'll be fine. Steer away from most lattes because they are very sweet, in that artificial and cloying way. Their more regular items are too overpriced in their neighbourhood, with cafes nearby that are famous for the quality of coffee. I also tried this avocado drink, which was super thick and basically like drinking blended whole avocados. At least it was good value for my money lol  Come for the ambience, skip if you care about the quality of your caffeinated drinks."}
{"text":"CUTENESS EXPLOSION. Be prepared for teddy bears everywhere!! Teddy Story is the spot for superrr kawaii picz.  Pros: - New and clean! - Huge selection of teddy bears and teddy bear accessories. - Drinks made fresh to order. - Prices were decent for drinks/food less than $6, teddy bears start at $30. - Not busy, it was completely empty when we entered. - I enjoyed their cheese cake and the strawberry smoothie, it was alright.  Cons: - Tables are small, so you can't play board games or stay too long. - It can be eerily quiet at times.  Definitely recommended! I live in the neighbourhood and really liked it here, but won't be coming back anytime soon... It's a cute and novelty place - great for pictures and special events! They should consider hosting kids birthday parties, tea parties, baby showers, etc."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place when I was visiting Toronto and looking for a place to sit down, have coffee and maybe some dessert.  Being that it was a Monday and Thanksgiving in Canada, a lot of places were closed, except starbucks and little place.  So I decided to check it out.    When I arrived, I was a bit confused cause it looked more like a toy store with a lot of Teddy Bears instead of a cafe, well I walked it and found that it was both! haha.  This store looks like a Teddy Bear vomited out lots of Teddy Bears with over-the-top cuteness all throughout the store, I was a bit uncomfortable with so much stuff animals but still decided to give it a try.   I ordered the Hazelnut White Chocolate Latte with Almond Milk and my parents got the cake, and americano and some espresso bar.  Everything was actually really tasty!  Nothing was overly sweet (which was a concern of mine because most cute places are like that) and we enjoyed our little break from touring Toronto.    There is an extensive menu of drinks and I'd recommended the latte I ordered if you cannot decide.  Staff were friendly, helpful and gave suggestions on what we should try.  Bathroom was also really clean."}
{"text":"A teddy bear boutique + café. The store is filled with teddy bears of all sizes - too overwhelming for me and not my style BUT the quality of the drinks & cake was surprisingly good!  I had the Mocha which was delicious - not powdery at all, like a rich hot chocolate, complete with super cute teddy bear latte art! I also had the Chocolate Truffle Cake - not heavy at all. Creamy and light with strong truffle flavour.  Would recommend checking it out even if you don't like teddy bears. The mocha is definitely better than some coffee franchises."}
{"text":"Such a cute little Café. I've always wanted to come here as I am borderline obsessed with cute teddy bears! So I've really come to the right place.  I love their selection of espresso, frappés, got chocolate, lattes, smoothies and more. I was slightly disappointed with their dessert selection. Although they had a few, I was hopping for a more home made dessert and now the so called mass produced \"la rocca\" mini dessert which were tasty but I can get anywhere. With the authenticity and unique concept of a Café, I was hoping for a cool dessert to go along with their cool drink menu.   I love how they play paddington bear in the sitting area, they decorate the cafe to each holiday. I went and it was Halloween themed! Super cute!   Also you can buy your own bear and dress it up... \"build a bear\" much.   This place caters more for younger kids but hey! Aren't we all at heart!?"}
{"text":"Cute pastries and lattes :) service was good but the non stop jewelry box music may be annoying over time."}
{"text":"The desserts and drinks were decent - probably a 3/5? But what makes Teddy Story special is the café's overall theme and atmosphere. The decor and food are both Instagram worthy...lots of props to work with."}
{"text":"Unplanned trip passing by teddy story. In this store there bunch of cuties here. Whether you are looking a gift for your love ones or your little ones. I bet u can find a gift to go. Besides the teddies, there are cakes and coffee/ teas. Cute lattes"}
{"text":"Review is long overdue but nice and short. Very cute cafe. Came here while waiting for dinner at Gyu Kaku and decided to have a papaya smoothie. It was fresh and tasty (they use fresh fruits). I would totally recommend checking it out and having a coffee or tea here. The teddys are quite interesting for sure! There were lots of people shopping for them while I was here."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! There are tons of teddy bears on sell and display. The store is quite small with limited seating. But on the day I went there was no one else so we took our time taking pictures. The store manager was very sweet and let us moved around bears and things for better photos. Most of the drinks here are hot chocolate and milkshakes/slushies. The toast marshmallow hot chocolate is the most photogenic choose, but it was very sweet. I ended up liking the oolong milk tea much better."}
{"text":"This could be the cutest café in Toronto, Canada or the world except it is not primarily a café, but a toy store specializing in teddy bears. Plush toys are usually cute, but everyone knows that teddy bears are not only the cutest, but also the classiest, nicest and most smart of them all so Teddy Story is as good as it gets.  Teddy Story sells hand-made teddy bears of all sizes, shapes and personalities (except all teddies are kind and friendly of course). They have 10 cm teddies and a couple of meter and a half ones. One chooses a companion, dresses him or her and adds a story and goes home happily.   Thankfully the owner has had the brilliant idea of adding a dedicated corner of the store to being a café and one can order attractive and colourful pastry, cookies and choose from a menu of daily specials, coffee, café au lait and teas. Not only the coffee was deep and tasty, but they also add cute designs (hint: it could be beary) to your beverage.  The café and store are not only cute, but also clean and tidy and show a pride of ownership. This is clearly both a business and a labour of love. The owner and her employee were poring over our beverages and, although the design of the bear needed some work, they were clearly caring and earnest. Speaking of the owner and employee they are polite, friendly and well put together. I almost wanted to thank the pretty owner for her store and demeanour! The website has a couple of spelling mistakes, but represents the store well. Please stay friendly and humble and kudos.  They have a table already occupied by a teddy so feel free to sit with her and treat her and yourself to a tea or smoothie. They were showing a Paddington bear cartoon on the wall, yet their store is still quiet and tranquil so go enjoy the treat, beverage or the bears as your eyes wander.  Teddy Story is the prime destination when looking for a friend/teddy bear or when downtown having some quiet time and a treat."}
{"text":"Teddy Story is a little cafe tucked away with a small entrance on Adelaide street. The cafe sells collectible Teddy Bears (not your regular kind from a department store) that are from Teddy House in Thailand. The bears can be dressed in many outfits (mind you, it can end up being quite pricy).   The decor is quite welcoming and the teas are excellent. I ordered the Citrus Oolong tea and the barista served it up with plenty of tea leaves making the tea more flavourful than I expected!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely adorable and the service was quick and fantastic!  The staff was kind and the desserts were SUPER good.  We got the rasberry pistachio mousse and their chocolate mousse.  For drinks, we purchased the toasted marshmallow hot chocolate and milkshake. Both were yummy and pretty sweet.  If you want to enjoy cute desserts in a cute atmosphere, go here!"}
{"text":"I recently saw IG posts about this newly opened, teddy-themed cafe in Corktown and I have to check it out :) Immediately, you are surrounded by all these cute teddy bears and super cute outfits for them too - from keychains to regular size, life size, and ginormous ones where you just want to lay on their soft tummy (and squeeze them and huggles them - don't judge me lol).  Teddy Story is beautifully decorated inside, has a huge screen playing Paddington Bear, and a small seating area at the back as well - I felt like I was Alice in Wonderland having a tea party with teddy bears ^^  They have a nice selection of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and also fruit smoothies! Ordered the toasted marshmallow hot chocolate and it came with marshmallows, rainbow sprinkles (yay!) and chocolate drizzles on top. I thought they were going to torch the marshmallow when I saw toasted... would've been even better!  There was one lovely lady working on the floor and behind the coffee bar that late afternoon. She seemed new, so we didn't rush her and told her to take her time. She was very polite and courteous, and then offered each customer a slice of strawberry cheesecake and a goodie bag full of treats to take home ^^ Thank you so much - I really appreciate that :)  I would love to come back and try their smoothies next time ^^ It is definitely a nice place to catch up with a friend or two. If you want to impress your date, and you know she likes these cutesy things - this is your place lol.  P.S. Christine, this is for you :)"}
{"text":"Nestled in downtown there is a place which upon entrance took me to my  happy place- - It's like I had followed the yellow brick road home and had been invited to the party either to celebrate Care Bears reunion or a Potluck at Alice in Wonderland or Willy Wonka's.  There were cute stuffy bears in all sizes which lined the walls along with their outfits ... enticing the kid in me to drop everything all my worries, work stresses, and just play... and if the Play notion wasn't enough... on the left side there were delicious desserts and a fully stocked caffeinated drinks and smoothie bar, a friendly barista ready to take my order. I ordered the Lavender Green Tea. (Yum)  Then I took my  drink and sat in-front of a big screen which had cartoons like Winnie the Poo playing without sound-- but the music in the background carried me away to a fantasy land--- Far Far away for a few minutes on my lunch break.  Ahhhhh I can't wait to take a Teddy home and play dress up (-;"}
{"text":"Environment is quiet and cute, but taste is so so... very disappointed, it's not home freshly baked. All bought from outside. And too sweet. It's just a place to take photos."}
{"text":"The store is pretty cuuuute *^*  The staff are friendly and they have a great promo going on  If you buy a bear it's 30% off  Outfits are buy one get one free  They accidentally made us another drink but gave it to us on the house, offered us chocolate.  The end before we left they even gave us a bear for free. Overall I recommend teddy story ~"}
{"text":"Teddy Story is a newly opened cafe on Church and Adelaide selling a variety of plush teddies from Teddy House; a popular brand from Thailand. In addition to selling teddy bears, they also serve specialty coffee, premium hot chocolate, real fruit smoothies, cakes and macarons for both dine-in and takeout. The concept itself is very cute, and great for a casual get-together with friends or dates.  As for my drink, I opted for the Toasted Marshmallow Hot Chocolate. The hot chocolate was served with white marshmallows and drizzled with chocolate syrup. The cup of hot chocolate was pretty standard, but it was prettily designed and great for an IG photo. Besides an extensive menu of both cold and hot drinks, they also serve a decent selection of pastries. They don't bake them in-house, but they do get them fresh in the morning from an uptown bakery.   The stand-out feature of the cafe has to be the selection of teddy bears from Teddy House. Unlike Build-A-Bear Workshop, you cannot build your own teddy bears at Teddy Story. However, you can customize your teddy bear with a variety of customized clothing pieces (prices vary). The teddy bears are displayed all throughout the cafe, and they do come in various sizes.  Teddy Story also offers a personalized delivery service, where the gift would be delivered in person to the recipient by Teddy Ken; their mascot.  The location itself is conveniently located downtown and a few minutes away from the Eaton's Center. The overall decor was very Instagrammable with its white, clean and sleek look. Guests are also welcome to move around the large teddy bears located in the seating area for photos. Very cute place!   Read more at foodaholicblog.blogspot.ca/2017/02/teddy-story.html."}
{"text":"Super adorable cafe! I think the concept is very fun - a cafe that offers coffee, lattes, smoothies, macaron and cakes, along with selling teddy bear and teddy bear clothing and accessories. I can imagine going here for a date night or catch up session with girlfriends. The decor along with the packaging of the cake boxes is beautiful.  The owner is super friendly. She greeted me when I walked in/left, gave me time to look over the menu, and gave me recommendations as well.   Prices are average. A smoothie was around $6."}
{"text":"Favorite place to date and study. The server is very sweet and accomodating. Great service with a variety of coffee, milktea and desserts. Best place for teddybear-lover and couple. Personally recommend the rose milktea and strawberry cheesecake. Will definitely come back again! Perfect cafe with the perfect service. I think it deserves a 10/10."}
{"text":"Came by with a friend of mine on Saturday and was greeted by friendly staff and an empty store. I ordered a matcha latte with soy and my friend got a tea. Too bad I didn't try the coffee but the matcha latte was overly sweet for my tastes. You come for the teddy bears not the food/drinks after all. The cafe/store wasn't overly crowded which was a huge bonus as we were able to take pictures without interruption. Overall, Teddy Story is one of those places where you come once and don't come back again (or if you're a huge teddy bear fan) or come once in a while."}
