{"text":"Convenience is the type of place you'd go once for some cute pictures. But other than that the food, drinks and service was subpar.  I didn't expect much food wise. We ordered the yuca tots, burger queen, Mac and ribs, boom boom bap, fried chicken, beef patty.  The yuca tots were good and everything else was mediocre at best. The fries that come with the burger were extremely salty and the ketchup had a weird aftertaste I'm thinking licorice? Could be wrong but it's no Heinz ketchup.  So you would think at least their drinks would be good considering it is a bar but I was left unsatisfied. Tried the negroni, old fashioned and a whiskey and ginger ale. All fairly watered down and tasteless.  Probably wouldn't go again but at least I got some insta worthy pics."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, really random decor, feels mismatched/hodgepodge, pretty shitty service. The $5 drinks are teensy!"}
{"text":"not your typical idea of date night..but it's the first friday the 13th of 2018,why not enjoy a place with vhs and old school music"}
{"text":"This place seems to get a lot of attention for their 80's aesthetic, but I think their food is worth some attention too.  Our group ordered Yuca tots, Korean fried cauliflower and the Nashville fried chicken. They were all really good, with the Yuca tots being something unique that I haven't seen elsewhere.   Good drinks, and a nice huge patio which is a great spot during the summer. Lots of space inside too if that's your thing or it's the winter that looks like it could accommodate groups of many sizes."}
{"text":"Great retro vibe - and very Instagramable! The food was by no means healthy, but a great cheat meal. Perfect to share with friends! Cocktails are super tasty, too."}
{"text":"Convenience is located on the north west corner of Queen W and Northcote just a couple blocks east of Dufferin.  Convenience is cool.  That's about the shortest description I can give.  That's not me trying to be short, I'm tall.  The thing is cool is so relative and I'm an old school type of guy.  Retro old with a side of sugar.  The entrance of Convenience looks like a convenience store.  Maybe it was at one time?  I can't remember what was here at the time but the post office is still there near Lisgar, the doughnut store seems gone, the Gladstone is well not what it used to be and the entire neighborhood has changed from what I remember it being a young one that grew up in Parkdale.  There's some old school stuff to be had in the old store part like Lick N Dip, Popeye cigarettes, and other candy that was around when you were young too.  Go to the bar and it's a nice space, open and with a retro look.  They just finished their outdoor patio last week!  The thing is the patio closes at 11pm because it's a residential building and area too.  That's sort of a bummer but it's understandable.  Besides drinks this stop in our little walk around involved getting some bites to go with...  We walked from The Shameful Tiki so I was dying for a beer and Convenience conveniently had that and other things to go with our drinks such as some things that on paper sound good.  So we went with a couple safe favorites in Nashville hot chicken (boneless) plate that comes with a little side of macaroni as well as Korean fried cauliflower and some wings as well.  Now the Nashville chicken was deboned thigh which I happen to be a fan off.  The batter seemed rather thick and the heat wasn't as hot as I had hoped for but the coating was crispy and the chicken was still tasty.  I would have liked it a bit more oily for Nashville hot.  I like what PG Clucks has to offer when it comes to that which seems closer to what I'm used to seeing at more places like in the US (where Nashville hot is from obviously).  The wings had a good taste, sauced of course and the KF cauliflower was good but it's veggies.  I mean I would rather it be chicken!  But it's a nice change of pace.  The star of this night however was the \"yuca tots\".  Yuca - shredded like hash browns, shaped and formed into cubes like tater tots with sort of the same consistency topped as if they're like Taco Bell fries supreme sort of but with pickled jalapenos, cheese and other goodness.  These things were so good.  I mean I had my fair share of yuca in Miami but this was crazy different and great!  The restrooms have a surprisingly wide staircase to the basement and the rooms are defined by either He-Man and She-Ra on the door. The stalls have black light (ultraviolet) and Masters of the Universe wall paper.  Crazy...  Overall this place was to my liking.  I liked the snacks, the drinks and the vibe.  The new addition of the patio is just in time for the good weather as well."}
{"text":"Aesthetically pleasing, but not so much your go to food place. The menu plays on the concept of convenience store candies and incorporate it in the meals. Definitely a fan of their drink menu because although some ingredients may stand out as \" strange \" the flavours ressemble the candies or given names.   The overall setting is great! It is popular for the pink washrooms and back area for dinning. The main entrance is your typical convenience store with all the goodies. Just around the corner is the dining area and a bar. The music creates a nice atmosphere with throwbacks of r&b.   Overall it's a good place to meet friends, hang out with friends and get drunk with friends!"}
{"text":"Not very impressive.   POSTIVES:  Environment is awesome.  Service was great.  Drinks were cheap.  NEGATIVES:   Didn't really wow me. But I would suggest checking it out.   GET THE YUKO TOTS OR THE BURGER."}
{"text":"Food is terrible . Service is okay. Order the boomboom bap , which is their version of the bibim bab what a disgrace to Korean food. Like what is that rice they use ?? Uncle Ben's ??? And the Mac n cheese is salty. This was during pre close time so there's no excuse. Will come try other things later but definitely won't be ordering those two things off the menu."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday to have a few drinks (and take a few pics) with my girlfriends. I had strongly suggested we eat elsewhere given the overwhelming reviews of how awful the food was. However, we decided to take our chances and we're very pleasantly surprised. They happened to have just launched a new menu (literally the night we went was the first night) and gone are the weird candy themed dishes. The new menu is actually really good. We had the tots (yummy), the pogo sticks (average mozzarella sticks), the spicy fried chicken with Mac and cheese (fabulous), the cauliflower (also fabulous), and the beer and quinoa salad (average). Overall the chicken and Mac was the highlight, and the ice cream sandwiches were superb. Cocktails were well made, service was good, and price was very reasonable. I would recommend giving them a second chance (if you'd been before but hated the food), and definitely a first chance if you haven't been yet. Vibe, crowd, and interior design were of course a+."}
{"text":"Come on this place is fun. Pink wall of phones. Neon. Candy. Fun menu. Worth a try. It's Instagram worthy so all the millennials will love it."}
{"text":"Food - Fries were good but there wasn't many options for someone who doesn't eat meat. I was suggested to try the pogo sticks with cheese inside. It was basically two giant mozzarella sticks (not the best tasting). We also had mac and cheese and the yuca appetizer, those were the better tasting dishes.   Checked out the bathroom as well and it's as portrayed in photos, downstairs is lit with pink light with great lighting in the washrooms.   This restaurant is more comfort food than bar food but served with drinks and cocktails. Overall liked the vibe, the music and the aesthetic. Not the best food."}
{"text":"I'd be surprised to hear that anyone went here for anything but the washrooms at this place. They're all over Insta which is ultimately why my friends and I decided to check this place out.  Walking into Convenience is like walking into a retro convenience store from your childhood, literally. The front area is a small convenience store which sells a variety of candy you probably haven't had since you were a kid.  Upon our arrival we were told it would be a 40 minute wait and that we could grab a drink at the bar in the meantime. We wound up checking out the washrooms downstairs and sneaking some photos with the phone wall in while we waited. By the time we were done we were seated at a nice and spacious high top table in the middle of the room.  We had already ate prior to heading out so we just ordered drinks. The house wine is about $1/oz but you're definitely getting what you pay for with this one. My friend also tried the cosmo which both of us found pretty gross overall.  Not entirely sure if I'd come back here or not, but it's a cool place to check out at least once. They did a great job overall with the interior decorating."}
{"text":"After all the Instagram hype, I decided to finally go go convenience, mostly because the drinks are cheap and the decor is cool.   I wasn't disappointed by the drinks as they are super cheap... A little watered down? Possibly... but what would you expect for 5/10 dollars for a drink with 2 oz alcohol? I had the tap wine as well which wasn't bad.   The decor is so cool, I understand the hype. The bathroom area is the coolest thing, no wonder everyone wants selfies of themselves there for IG. The store front is nice too.  The reason why I gave three stars is definitely the food... The food is cheap ish but very average. I had the kale and beets salad and it was ok (a salad is a salad) but I was super excited about the pop rock olives and unfortunately it fell flat. It's pretty much a salad with pop rocks. The tapioca nachos were alright but the salsa is pretty sweet and I really didn't like the overpowering sugary flavour.   Service was good and everything was served quick.   Would recommend for drinks and for the decor!"}
{"text":"Great and fun atmosphere however, they need more menu options and dessert was sold out at 9!?  Food was good but not great."}
{"text":"went here for drinks after dinner for my friend's bday - she recommended this place based on the photos on instagram not word of mouth or personal experience.  The reason I'm giving this place a 3 stars is because the drinks are all watered-down - we didn't order food so i can't comment on that.   i got a pine colada cocktail and it wasn't the typical drink - it looked and tasted more like a rum sour but diluted. i also got the creamsicle - better than the first but still diluted. my friends also said that their drinks were diluted, one commented that her vodka soda tasted like water  they have a long list for drinks but based on the taste of it, I'd say the price is too much.  the decor of this place, however, is over the top - it really builds on the retro theme from the moment you step in to the toilet stalls. when you first enter, the place is set up to look like a small convenience store with nick nacks such as candles, gums, lollipops, terracotta, etc. the restaurant itself is lit by black lights but they also have other lightings so it's not completely dim. We went on a Thursday night so there was live DJ.   I would recommend this place for the novelty/decor of it but not for the drinks"}
{"text":"Everyone is pissed because the food and drinks aren't that great and that it's a gimmicky place, but are you going to a bar that's insta famous for the food? It's kind of gimmicky in a way that there is just so much going on that I feel like it works. From the botega-esque entrance to the plants hanging on the ceiling, to the party line (the germaphobe in me would not dare touch the phone against my face)...I was really into the screens above the bar that show the entrance to the washrooms, with the famous party line telephones. It can get pretty wild on Friday night, I'm talking hand-stand twerking against the wall. People watching is fun. Also, the drinks are pretty cheap by Toronto standards so like don't complain. You can get hammered and have a great time. The vibes are great at this place, you can actually get a table, the service is excellent and the music was lit. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I had a great time at convenience. We made a reservation so we were promptly seated at a communal high top table that I did not mind. The $5 2 oz draft cocktails were great and such a good idea! The food was a little below average. We ordered the Mac And cheese which tasted like KD. We also ordered the shishito peppers which were very salty and not the best. But the fried chicken was great, the only food item I'd recommend to order. The ambiance and the downstairs foyer were pretty cool. I wouldn't say I'd go out of my way to go back again but it is a neat little place to check out and the drinks are well worth it!"}
{"text":"Interesting from the outside as it looks like a convenience store.  It has a very retro feel once you enter.   We ordered every dish on the menu.  Some of the appetizers were strange. But at 5 dollars we decided to order it.  It wasn't good.  Actually most of the snacks and appetizer dishes were just not good. We left some of it untouched.   Stick with the main dishes. The burger was great and cheesy.   Stay away from some of their small dishes."}
