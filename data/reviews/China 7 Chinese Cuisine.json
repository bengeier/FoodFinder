{"text":"China 7 has always been one of my favorite places for good food, a friendly staff and very reasonable prices. Service is fast and the orange chicken is to die for! My wife's favorite is the almond chicken."}
{"text":"I love this place my family goes here a lot probably for like 13 years and the food is still delicious."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! - The food is sub-par, quality of the food is terrible.  I ordered the mongollian beef for lunch.  The beef and fried rice were tasteless.  My mother had the sesame chicken which did not taste good as well.  There was over half on the plate when I informed the waitress that I could not eat anymore because it did not taste good.  I only ate ass much as I did because I don't like returning food but I just couldn't force myself to eat another bite.  I admit I should have told them immediately it was bad.  She immediately got defensive and said they have been here for 15 years and no one complains about the food and that it must be me.  She may have been right and maybe it wasn't the taste I like for mongollian beef but she didn't ask if I wanted anything else.  She got the manager who also told me they have been there 15 years and no one complains and it's just me.  They were rude the way they spoke not only in what they said but how they acted when they said it.   Buyer BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Great local eatery. We always do carryout and it is extremely quick and easy. Very good food and we have never been disappointed. My favorite is their Orange Chicken, I have not found anyone that can make it better. Great local small business!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and love this place!  There are 2 other chinese places close by but my family likes China 7 the best.  Good fried rice,  chow mein, orange chicken and beef with brocoli, mu goo gai pan and mu shu chicken. They have great lunch specials also.  I have never been disapointed except when they close for a month to go back to China."}
{"text":"We found this small restaurant a few years ago. Since then it has become one of our favorite go to places. We have never been disappointed. The staff is friendly and our waitress always remember what we order down to providing the hot and sour soup for me in place of the won ton soup. The prices for the lunch are unbelievable."}
{"text":"So much for home made egg rolls, I guess they are too expensive and time consuming to make so they decided to serve pre-maid frozen ones that are wormed up and served to order. Very bad choice not to mention that the new egg rolls taste horrible. I have been ordering their egg rolls for 15 years... One more restaurant that chooses to sacrifice quality and happy customers over cheap food... One would think that with all the complaints they would raise the prices to keep popular food on the menu rather than discontinue it and serve a very poor quality substitute."}
{"text":"Good food, the staff is very nice, clean but the music is the same song over and over no matter what day you go."}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese restaurant. Been there lots of times! Always the same great food, good quantity, great service."}
{"text":"Overcharged us for our food. Ordered the 5 dollar lunch specials and she brought us the dinner plates. The waitress was rude. Never going back."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good and cheap

But I tried the teriyaki chicken and it was terrible.    owner refused to give credit or replacement

I'll go elsewhere"}
{"text":"It's a small and quiet place. Very clean and friendly. They have a great lunch menu that doesn't dent the wallet. The Chicken Curry is excellent! I tend to go for the small family run \"hole in the wall\" places. It's where the best food is. If you're into that, then this is another place to put on your list. 
I'm definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food for a good price.  The MuShu pork is good but different - hot & Sour soup is good.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Eggroll had 1 tablespoon of filling. Unacceptable. They were a gross mouthful of uncooked wrapper. Incredibly bad.

The wings were dry but acceptable. Nothing to return for.

The Kung Pao chicken had chicken, stringy green onions, and a tablespoon of peanuts. No texture. No spice. Just sugary sauce and mush. Really bad. It used to have celery, water chestnuts, and carrots. It sorely misses that textural element.

The Kung Pao broccoli was the same as above without chicken. I requested extra spicy. I got a spice level appropriate for a young child.  Too sweet for me to even eat. It went in the garbage.

The egg drop soup was really good, but there was nothing in it but broth, egg white, and about a teaspoon of mushroom and water chestnut. It at least had good flavor.

I will NOT be returning.  I would not spend a penny in this broken down joint that made the decision to increase profits by cutting quality.   Go the extra block to Good China for the quality.  This place will be shuttered in no time."}
{"text":"We just ordered take out from here for Mothers Day. When we got home and started to dish up, we found a cockroach in our food!!!!!! We promptly took the container with the roach back to the restaurant. The server refused to refund our meal stating she wanted all of the food back (which was in the trash) before she would refund anything. Back to the house i went to start trash diving!!! When i returned the manager proceeded to argue with me about the amount of food that was back in the containers.... at this point i offered to bring him my trash can. Which he said was not needed. The whole time i was speaking to the manager the server proceeded to make rude and unnecessary remarks to the point where i stopped and asked if she was going to be handling the complaint or the manager. Now let me say that i managed and worked in restaurants for  15 years and i understand mistakes happen. I would have never posted this if the manager and server at least said sorry 1 single time.  Instead they placed blame on the customers. Stuff happens but what occurred afterwords if appauling!!! We ordered from here close to once a week and will no longer be customers...... dont let your Pride get in the way of Customer Service!!!!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!  The staff are very rude, they do not refill your water, wipe their snot on their sleeves, and speak in Chinese, barley speak the language.  Their fried chicken lemon was frozen in the center, and I found a beetle in my rice!!!!!!  I don't think they truly respect and take pride in owning a business in America.  I will never come back."}
{"text":"Simple and small restaurant.  It is very clean and the food is always fresh and so good. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm not into a big fancy Chinese restaurant,so this place is perfect for me. Simple,good,and inexpensive sums it up. Small place with great service"}
{"text":"A good place for takeout. Good location, right around the corner from Fry's. Fast, friendly service, and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is a bad news ... the service is so bad .. the waitress has no personality at all ..!! Food is ok Bt bad bad bad service ..!! Never never going back"}
{"text":"Walked in 41 minutes prior to close. Door sign said they closed at 930pm. Man says: ordering to go? Said no, table for 3 please.  \"We are closing in 20 minutes\" (even though a party of 6 was enjoying a meal nearby) 
Who closes 20 minutes early, and turns down potential business 41 minutes prior to stated close time. Especially when at this very intersection you have : Good China and Shanghai Grill. 3 options at this intersection.  

I will gladly take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We have been going to China 7 for many years now.  The service is excellent, the food is fresh and delicious, and the location is easy to get in to and out of- very convenient.  You will not be disappointed with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good food as well as good service. Nothing fancy but the facility is clean and inviting. Glad to have found a fast laid back Chinese place near my new house."}
{"text":"Darn... I forgot to snap a photo.  This place is one of my new favorites. Food and service is always fast, consistent, priced right and plentiful. Where do you go these days to have moo goo gain pan, wonton, eggroll, egg drop soup and hot tea for $5?  That's right...China 7 baby. Basically any lunch option like this is 5.95 or 4.95. I only have One complaint and it's LEGIT. They play the same song for ambiance over, over and over. Take your earbuds and you'll never know!"}
{"text":"Great place for specials anytime although lunch is cheaper.  I usually go there when working in the Peoria area and have never been disappointed.  The price is always good too."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food I've ever had. My kids are pretty good eaters and usually eat anything you give em , but even they thought it was bad. The crab ragoons (or crab puffs, same thing) had nearly NOTHING in them, the recommended house special chicken was not fried to perfection (like the menu says it is), they didn't give us napkins or plastic cutlery, my chicken and broccoli had nearly no taste at all, and the fried rice was just rice with brown coloring (no peas, carrots, egg, zilch).I could go on and on, but I'll stop. This was my first time ever leaving a yelp review. I usually like something that my family and I can agree on, but not this time around. I will give kudos where it's due... the food was hot and fresh. This place is most frequented by Sun City residents so they probably cater to their taste buds. Good for them, not for me."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Fast service. Nice staff. Good food. Got an order of crab puffs  and two combo meals."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for more than 10 years, never a bad experience, always delicious and inexpensive! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love this place! The orange chicken here is amazingly good and their portions are huge! The waitress is always very nice and even remembered all of our favorites."}
{"text":"Eat here at least 3xs a month for the past 2 years.  Always a good experience and consistent service.  Love the Happy Family dish.  You get an abundance of food for the money."}
{"text":"Do not order the wonton soup. It taste like dirty dishwater. The waitress says that's how it's suppose to taste. Who is she trying to fool!!! The crab puffs were average. I would not recommend this restaurant, unless you are over 50 and have lost all your tastebuds."}
{"text":"Drove 15 mins one way to get to this place. It was my first time trying their food, once I ate the food I have to say I was disappointed.  Food needed more flavor, tofu was way too soft to where the texture was soggy.  Unfortunately I will not be returning back to this place. NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR!!! Try elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best Chinese food I've ever had. The food is great and budget friendly and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"This is our \"go-to\" place for Chinese food. It's just good, cheap food and plenty of it! The vegetables are fresh, the shrimp are large, the sauces are tasty. I've never had a bad meal, but some of my favorites are Happy Family, Egg Foo Yung, Beef and Broccoli, and Shrimp with Vegetables. The \"combo\" meal includes soup, entree, egg roll and a crab puff, at a bargain price. My only disappointment has been that they've changed their egg rolls recently. I think they used to be homemade, now they are probably frozen. I still love the crab puffs though!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been eating here for years. They are always friendly and quick to make our food.  Their pot stickers & eggrolls are to die for."}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food (and service) I have ever had....the broccoli and fried items were definitely old.  The servers were not friendly at all and were put out when asked for anything.  I would never go back!  Too many other places out there to spend my money."}
{"text":"Had to find a new place when Golden Star on Bell rd. closed. My family and I have eaten here 4 or 5  times.

The staff is friendly and courteous, the restaurant is clean.

The food is served quick and is always hot and fresh. The Orange Chicken is the best I have ever tasted anywhere. My wife and I usually enjoy the Shrimp w/vegetables and our kids split a large Orange Chicken. I must admit the I find myself sneaking pieces of the chicken throughout the meal. The crab puffs are good but the egg rolls are not really impressive."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in the area. Every dish we have tried was exceptional and at a decent price. Try this one and you won't go back to the others"}
{"text":"I ordered take out, so this review won't include customer service, etc. My coworker and I ordered orange chicken, fried rice, egg drop soup and crab puffs. Every single thing was completely disappointing. The orange chicken had a thick marmalade texture and did not taste very good. The fried rice was just what the name is--fried rice. There weren't onions, scrambled eggs, peas or carrots. I would have been better off ordering white rice; pretty much the same thing. The egg drop soup was not very good either. And the crab puffs hardly had any filling. I was really craving Chinese food at the time and I was so disappointed when I took those first bites. I won't be trying this place again."}
{"text":"We have come here for years, really do like this place.  Food is reasonably priced and consistently good and always fresh.  The staff is very nice.  It's not fancy but it is comfortable and welcoming.  Great neighborhood place.   I don't get some of the 1 star reviews, especially from someone who has been there several times.  If a place is so bad it only deserves 1 star then why would someone come back??  How do you trust a review from someone like that?"}
{"text":"Very clean and bright. Family run, with reasonable prices.  I've been eating there for years and never been disappointed. Their customers matter to them"}
{"text":"I like this place..it reminds me of another little family owned Chinese restaurant we frequented when we lived in California.  It's basic inside but the food is fresh, reasonable and really good.  We ordered take out again the other night and it was still HOT when we got home and the rice was fluffy and perfect...I even like to eat it plain.  We usually get the Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and the Shrimp and Snow Peas and they are always good.  I love the fact that the vegetables are fresh, plentiful and still have a little snap.  Too many other local Chinese places drench everything in sauce, overcook their food and its just too much glop.
I read some of the other complaints regarding service and I say - Hey, these people work their butts off 6 days a week while their little one plays in the corner...cut them a little slack.
The food is delicious, the people are nice and the price is right so enjoy it."}
