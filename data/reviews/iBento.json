{"text":"I thought I'd give this place a try as it's close to my new job, and I'm always looking for inexpensive lunch options.  I was happy to see they had seaweed salad which I love.  However, once I got my sushi and seawead salad back to my office, I realized that the salad was probably from the previous week (this was a Tuesday after a long weekend) but had a fresh layer over the top disguising the slimy, darkened salad underneath.  It's still making me nauseous thinking about it. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"For the MSG lover. The instant the $5 ramen was placed in front of me, the overwhelming scent of MSG soup washed over me. I watched the lady use one of those 10cent instant ramen packages to make it behind the counter, and the bowl also included 1/4 a cabbage leaf, 5mm of carrot and about 10cm of broccoli and a sprinkling of nori. The picture on the menu shows an egg in the bowl. There was no egg. The taste of MSG soup remained with me hours after leaving."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. This place is where Tenshi Teriyaki used to be, and it is now run by an nice elderly couple. Everything here is really cheap (nothing over $8) even during dinner time, though they apparently close by 8PM. 

If I were just judging the food quality, I think I might bump down the score to just 3 stars. The sushi here is cheap, so don't expect it to wow you or anything! But I think this is a great location for students who are low on cash to grab a nice wholesome bite to eat. They give you a lot of food (12 dumplings, 8 pieces of california roll and miso soup) for $5.99 during dinner time. Good deal! The man behind the counter is really friendly as well, we struck up a nice conversation and it felt oddly like I was in the kitchen of some nice grandparents or something. :P

For a full review with more pictures (and a larger sized menu), please refer to my blog, which is conveniently located in my profile. Happy eating!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't regard the sushi has \"cheap\" here. I think it's no cheaper than any other sushi place. However, the sushi just isn't good. And if you don't want to die of diabetes in the restaurant, and have that on your grave stone. Don't buy the bubble tea here. Mine was warm and tasted like someone just dumped concentrate into two tablespoons of water. (And t'was very expensive.)"}
{"text":"This is one of the best small sushi places in the area. I think those reviews are really out dated. The guy who runs the place now makes avocado rolls that put other cheap sushi places to shame. The rolls are always fresh and delicious. The chicken in the S2 special is amazing too. If you want a quick affordable Japanese lunch or after work snack this is the best place."}
