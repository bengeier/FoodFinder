{"text":"Delicious, clean and the conveyor belt was a hit with the kids.   Lots of different types of sushi, salads and dessert items to choose from.  Regular/kids menu available for the anti-sushi appetite.   We will be back.   Such a fun experience!"}
{"text":"I tried this place again.. and just as I thought. It still hasn't updated it's taste in food at all. It was like I was there the first time all over again. I'm sorry to say but it's unenjoyable and gave me a tummy ache. Ordered the volcano roll I think and it was torched. It had a nasty gas burned flavor that wasnt good. I don't appreciate that. And I could see stack and stacks of already cooked tempura in the kitchen in the side. It's cooked but not cooked fresh when you ordered. It's a waste of money even though its cheap. Won't be going here ever ever again!!"}
{"text":"I was rather looking forward to trying the revolving sushi concept after having seen several Internet videos on them, but wow.. After I left, I immediately checked for reviews, wished I'd checked them first, and had to laugh.  Yes the food is awful, but the staff were all nice.  Imagine that sushi you see at a gas station that you'd never buy - that is the quality of all the food.  Super awful.  The deserts.. Costco bulk-buy cupcakes on a plate for $1.50.  When I saw the Snack-pak pudding cup I knew it was an all time low for a restaurant experience.  The atmosphere is also pretty lacking, so if you're looking for ambiance or a relaxing dinner - this ain't gonna be it.  Like other honest reviews, I'm really hoping I don't get sick from the sushi."}
{"text":"I was excited that there was a revolving sushi place. Unfortunately, the sushi was definitely out for long and the fish was old, particularly the yellowtail. Revolving places work well if you have enough people coming through. I think this place does not have that yet. They need to work on better sushi quality and working out the kinks on having the sushi it too long. I think restaurants should not do revolving or sushi boats until they are good at the quality of sushi."}
{"text":"I am really picky when it comes to Sushi, and this place is amazing. The food is really fresh, and of course they make more than just sushi. My favorite is the Monkey Rolls. I love that you can come in here, and all of the staff is polite and they don't bug you while you are eating. Most of all, we love the prices and the variety of sushi!"}
{"text":"If it weren't for the semi cold glass and beer I had. I would most definitely would of rate this place 2 and a half stars! My waiter was pretty sweet but that's about it. I am a little bit of a sushi freak.

There is something about warm Sushi that can really put you out for a couple of days and that just that scares me! #bubbleguts

Not the best but not the absolute worst. The place is pretty clean but unless you want to gamble with food poisoning I would not go! 

My stomach is rumbling now not sure that is a good sign! Uh-oh..."}
{"text":"This place was great! Went with my wife and daughters ages 4 and 6 and had a lot of fun and some great sushi. The girls mostly ate chicken nuggets and fries but the server also recommended a dumpling off the belt that they surprisingly loved. My favorite was the lobster roll. Everything was very fresh. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We used to go once a month after realizing that there are different employees each month we got concerned. The final time we ate there my husband had a stomach virus a real bad one actually! 
The day after I went to Asiana market where I saw an ex employee he warned me that the sushi is not fresh and the employees do not last long there! Nice
Well we're not going anymore!"}
{"text":"I had worse experience there ever the owner is a bitch the sushi is horrible I even saw a cook not even take their gloves off he just wash his gloves off with soap instead of taking them off I would rate it a zero star restaurant"}
{"text":"We won't be going back here. 

Food was poor quality. I don't expect perfect for the price. But, our favorite sushi place a few miles away fills us up with better quality for the same cost. 

The restaurant has a super cute idea, and seeing a bunch of colorful plates going around the room like one of those Christmas trains in stores was fun. That being said, when you got to what was actually on the plate, i became a sad panda. 

Rolls fell apart in the soysauce +wasabi mix constantly. I've never had this issue before, so i'm not sure why this was a problem here. It left my soysauce+wasabi mix cloudy and full of chunks. When a piece of fish fell out of one of them, I just ate it separately, and it was super fishy and the texture was of previously frozen fish. The wasabi had little to no spice as well. 

The main reason for the rating is the taste and quality. The bang for your buck is much better elsewhere. The service could have been better as well. 

Quick rundown on the service:

They were friendly when we came in and got us drinks quickly. But, they let those drinks run dry.It's self-serve on the conveyor belt obviously.  

It's self-service off the conveyor belt, obviously. The fault came when it was time to refill the conveyor. They were all gathered in a corner at what looked like a conveyor belt refill station, but they just sat their with a stack of plates chit-chatting. The conveyor belt went around 3 times with the spots empty for what we wanted before we started trying to flag them down for the plates. Low and behold they had them sitting right there. We had to try to flag them out of their conversation again when we wanted the check. This took multiple attempts."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting, raw.fish sits for more than 30 mins. Terrible service. Will not be back. Please save your time and go to SUSHI YUKI on 83rd and Thunderbird."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place after driving by for months and saying we should try it - I'm so glad we did. It was really good. The staff was nice and helpful and the sushi was all good. We almost didn't go because of the bad reviews but don't listen to them... we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Kiku Sushi is an amazing place. Not only is their sushi good but you can order fresh sushi if you don't like what's on the conveyer belt. I have extreme social anxiety but this place makes me feel comfortable which is saying a lot. When I have a bad day, this is where I go to cheer up."}
{"text":"So damn good. If I could give it 6 stars I would!  Who knew this lil gem existed in Glendale. Service on point."}
{"text":"i was so disappointed last time i went to eat this place about 6 month ago it was very dirty food was not worth my money and time. I went again last night after a friend invited me over a dinner at this place. all dishes were 2.50food was beyond awesome!! i found that there was a ownership change. the service was as good as the food. you should try to find out by yourself"}
{"text":"Awesome service throughout our visit! Super friendly staff. They seriously have a little bit of everything. I highly recommend this place. Very clean and well designed. The sushi chef even came to our table to talk to us :)

Prices: $1.00, $1.50, $2.00, $3.00 and $5 plates. 

Below is a small list of the items found on the conveyor belt.

Food: classic nigiri types, soy paper rolls, fruit bowls, vegetable bowls, specialty rolls, dessert plates, fruit cups, yogurt cups, edamame 

Drinks: ramune, apple juice, pineapple juice, orange juice, mixed fruit juice

The only reason why I did not give them 5 stars is because they were out of a lot of things that I wanted to order off of the menu. Even upon my second visit a couple weeks later they did not have the items in stock yet :("}
{"text":"Love the concept and pricing is very reasonable. Everything I ate was fresh and yummy. The kids loved the yakisoba. I will definately be a regular here."}
{"text":"It's really okay. The service was on the upper half of decent, just a little on the slow side. The sushi was definitely not the best. What other reviewers said about the hard rice was true on several pieces. 

It is revolving, however, which is nice because you can mix and match and try whatever you want. Boyfriend was satisfied with our experience there, and he's picky. I'd recommend it if you were looking into trying revolving sushi- though don't go in with amazing expectations for the sushi itself."}
{"text":"Rice to sushi ratio was perfect. Service was very attentive. I wish there was more of a selection of sushi. Miso was also very good."}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight. Let me just say great prices, great food and great service. The waitress was really nice. We sat at the sushi bar area, Joe was really friendly. We highly recommend this place. This is our 
new spot. The portions are perfect. 
If you dont like sushi they have amazing sesame chicken."}
{"text":"Amazing, super fresh, beautifully prepared sushi at a very affordable price.  I have been looking for sushi this good since I moved from Minnesota to Arizona. While there are many good sushi restaurants in Arizona, it seems a lot of them are more show than substance - by that I mean the fish is okay, but not of the highest quality. Kiku Sushi's uses fish of the highest quality and it shows in every serving. Nirvana!

Also, for those of you who are cautious to try raw fish sushi, Kiku Sushi offers a variety of sushi with smoked fish and also 100% vegetarian sushi.  In addition to the sushi itself, you can get fresh fruit, seaweed salad, chocolate lava cake, cheesecake (divine!) and a variety of other non-fish based dishes.

I have too many favorites to name, but I know I will always get the seaweed salad and the salmon and tuna nigiris and then try what else looks particularly appealing that night.  The portions are purposely small to encourage trying a variety of dishes, and it also keeps lunch and dinner more affordable for those of us on a budget. 

I would love this place even if it was housed in an old VFW building for the food alone, but luckily this place has a fun, relaxing, yet upbeat atmosphere, making it a  great place for dates, dinners out with friends, introducing kids to sushi, and large groups of people. Very warm and cheerful. The service is wonderful, too, with knowledgeable servers who can suggest dishes to suit pretty much everyone.  I will be coming by frequently - hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"Staff has terrific personality....really mean that. Super friendly. Unfortunately the food was bland and dry. Nothing like eating dry sticky rice. We might give it another chance :-/"}
{"text":"Service is great! Prices are great! Portions are a bit on the small side but for the price you can't beat it"}
{"text":"I don't like giving bad reviews but I was scared about possibly getting food poisoning from eating here. I didn't, but that was a thought after grabbing a dish of warm sushi. When we got there, there was only one table filled and plates upon plates of sushi revolving around two customers. My husband and I sat down and grabbed some plates that were cool going on warm. I wasn't happy about that. Then I grabbed a totally warm plate and was ready to leave. I don't understand, if you have zero-two customers, for what looked like a while, why would you put out a full load of sushi plates revolving around until they got warm? We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try this weekend. SO GLAD WE DID! I'm a big sushi fan, and I really enjoyed the revolving conveyor style service. We got to try some great new rolls and the staff was very attentive. They were constantly putting out new rolls, so nothing stayed out too long. We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Came here for girls lunch. Sushi is fresh! Love the tsunami roll and shrimp lollipop appetizer."}
{"text":"Updated Review:

The first time I came here I loved it, and have since gone back several times, when they are busy they have a hard time keeping up with orders, so anything popular, California rolls, edamame, gyoza, all goes super fast and is hard to get your hands on. When they are slow, the food sits there and becomes room temp, anything hot gets soggy from the condensation, so it's really hit or miss here."}
{"text":"fresh sushi, good variety, and good service. I have been to a couple revolving sushi bars and this is the best one so far. Will visit again."}
{"text":"It was a fun eating there. The revolving sushi concept makes eating sushi fun. Many different choice to choose from.  The only complaint is that the server was very inexperienced.  If he was on his game I would of ordered  Saki."}
{"text":"I have had other revolving sushi bars before.  This place was ok... it worked for a craving.  Other revolving sushi bars have been able to keep their product cold and fresh...Kiku lacked that aspect.  When we were trying dishes, many were room temp, and not the chilled cold you look for in raw sushi.  They are also very stingy with their wasabi, and not very attentive.  All in all, we will not be back again.  We will travel to Scottsdale to get our revolving sushi fix."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast. The staff was great and friendly. It did take a little bit of time to get it to go but understandable considering the point is to sit and grab the plates off the revolving belt. All the sushi is now $2.50 and is excellent. There is a large variety as well. Love this place."}
{"text":"Update (July 2017): Kiku is under new management and plate prices have changed to a flat $2.50 per plate. Variety has also improved, and the sushi that I've tried has been fresh, generously portioned, and tasty. Service is excellent, and the owner/chef is very friendly. This is now my favorite sushi spot in Arizona."}
{"text":"Fresh fish but a very average selection. Good for kids or people who don't like uni and special types of sushi."}
{"text":"If you are an experienced sushi connoisseur, don't go to KiKu Sushi. While the concept of simply choosing your desired roll as it passes by on the conveyer belt is not a novel concept, the benefits of this style of eating are many. For example, you know exactly how much you are spending (each plate color corresponds to a price) and you don't have to wait for your order to be made by the sushi chefs. Unfortunately, there are some downfalls to this style also, namely not knowing how long that raw fish has been cycling around the room (covered, but still warming up to room temperature), and the limitations of menu variety. This is one of the problems of KiKu Sushi. The rolls are mediocre, and look like grocery store-bought \"Krab\" California rolls doused with sweet and sour sauce and a piece of fish (or fruit - strawberries and kiwis??) dropped on top. Not very creative, and expensive for what you get - spicy tuna with mango was $3 for three pieces. Overall quality was poor, you had mediocre choices, and it was expensive for what was available. Service wasn't bad, but unfortunately I won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"Good sushi for the pice, not great like the more expensive kind, but good for the price."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun! The staff is great and there are a lot of options when it comes to sushi! They even have a couple of really yummy and unique rolls!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!
Delicious food, friendly staff and very reasonable price for the high quality sushi.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"As much as I enjoyed watching the plates move around on the conveyor belt, that is not enough to bring me back to Kiku Sushi. Some of the food was very visually unappealing, such as the \"Key West Roll\", which had green gunk squirted on top, or another roll, which looked like a pile of rice with vomit heaped on top. Not appetizing. I stuck with rolls I thought would be difficult to mess up, Philadelphia, shrimp tempura and spicy tuna; the rice in each one was dry and flavorless. The fish did not taste fresh, and while I love mango, the spicy tuna was not helped by it's inclusion, especially given that the roll tasted neither spicy, nor like tuna. I understand that the plates are moving on the belt, so the sushi is not being made to order, but some of the food I tasted probably should have been pulled a bit earlier."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. Interior is nice and very clean. It's your typical revolving sushi place. Quality isn't as high as a sit down restaurant but it's cheap and you get good variety."}
{"text":"Wow..i don't usually post reviews but this place has changed since the new ownership..The service is A+ and the food is fresh, the price is amazing and the establishment is clean..I visit Arizona at least once every other month and now I try to stop by when I get the craving for sushi..must try at least once if you are in the area..I love the kiku sushi, ahi tower, and bikini roll.."}
{"text":"Eek. This place is hideous. The food is a 1 star at best but the good service yielded it two more stars. I went tonight with a friend because she was curious about it. She got a Las Vegas roll, but it had way too much rice. She said it was disappointing.

Before going, I had read the previous reviews, and they were pretty spot on. I ordered the Korean BBQ beef. The sauce they used was incredibly sweet, like hoison sauce. Korean BBQ isn't supposed to be sweet like saccharine. I only ate half and boxed up the rest to take home. Big mistake. 

I never eat in my car, and get \"new car\" smell sprayed in my car when I take it to Danny's Car Wash.. The leftover Korean BBQ smelled a bit like poop in my car. I dislike wasting food but when I got home, I threw it away. 

I treated myself to the green tea ice cream. The server said the cook was making it fresh. The portion was extremely generous. It was delicious, but unfortunately, not enough to get me to come back here again."}
{"text":"Hello , I love Sushi ... well the place was nice but that's all it has. First time we went to eat here it was not full ,perfect. Then I noticed the prices did not match the menu on their website. They should fix that keep on eye on that. The other thing I noticed the plates go by color and most of them were Yellow. Not a lot to choose from. It was not what I expected, come out paying around $ 32 we didn't even eat that much. I came out with a stomach ache and my wife just didn't want to continue eating. I don't know what went wrong , just was not the place , the sushi and the service very dull ... so in others words : We've been to better Sushi places. Sayonara Kiku first and last time here."}
{"text":"I don't understand how their prices are so low here!  It's a fun idea to have the sushi moving through the restaurant, and even though I live right down the road, it took me years to come here because I thought, \"How good could it be if it's almost cafeteria-style?\"

It was my loss!  The sushi is actually great, AND they have tons of exciting, unique rolls including their daily specials.  A lot of it comes in 1/2 roll sizes, so you get 4 pieces, but most of the plates are only like $2-3 each.  We were on a date and up for anything, so the server had us try our first sake bomb, which was fun.

Seriously, it was so good we stuffed ourselves and even got second plates of a few things, and even with alcohol it was like $30 for 2 people.  If we hadn't been determined to keep trying things and hadn't gotten booze, we probably could have spent like $10 and still been moderately full.  I really didn't expect it to be so good, so unique, and still so inexpensive.  Crazy!"}
{"text":"If i could eat here everyday I would. Amazing taste, variety, and price. You will notttt regret making a trip here."}
{"text":"This place is close to my house so it's a convenient place to stop by for a quick couple plates of sushi. However, if you are looking for quality and a good price, then look elsewhere. The service is mediocre, but I never expect much when I come here. Don't be fooled by the conveyer belt. It looks cool, but it's just a fad. If you want sushi that's not on the belt then you'll have to request it from the servers. You should still give this place a try and judge for yourself."}
{"text":"Sushi was warm (not supposed to be) and not fresh. The idea of the food moving around is fun, but the reality of it means nothing is fresh or at the correct temperature. Our waitress actually told us to let her know what we wanted so she could make sure it was fresh.

This store closed, it moved to Glendale."}
{"text":"So far I've been to sushi station and Teharu and this is my favorite. The prices are really good at 2.50 for every plate and the food always seems to be fresh. EVERY single time I have came in I've been greeted by multiple people and the same as when I leave. One time I went in and the people sitting near us were being absolutely rude and difficult and their server was calm and nice to them the whole time and I just can't say I've ever had bad customer service here. This is the farthest revolving sushi place from us but the only one we bother to go to now."}
{"text":"So found this by accident was hungry and went in. The place is clean and no fishy smell they charge by plate color and each plate has either 2 or 4 pieces of sushi   This great so you can try many different types prices range from $1 to $5 I didn't see any $5 plates most where $2 or $4.  Lunch could be had for $10 easy.   My lunch was $15 and I had 6 different items including gyoza.   I live at the base of SoMountian and will make the trek back here."}
{"text":"I met up with friends after work and tried KiKu for the first time. It's a revolving sushi restaurant where you pay for the plates you eat. The sushi is pretty standard for this type of restaurant. I'm not expecting A+ sushi and it did the job for what I was looking for. 

The waitress was friendly but seemed easily flustered at special requests. She also forgot my friend's tea completely, but still put it on the bill. There are other revolving sushi places that I would recommend trying before KiKu, especially because their plates cost a little more. But if you just need some sushi, and are already in the area, it will get the job done."}
{"text":"In this, the west hood of Phoenix, they seem to roll up the sidewalks before 10:00.  I applaud that this restaurant stays open until 11:00.   Perfect meal after a movie.  This is typical conveyor sushi, so you want to do the land grab on the freshest pieces."}
{"text":"Great selection,  always good food, can't beat the prices! Try the bikini roll, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"Love the concept.  Food was real good. Staff very friendly and nice.  I ate so much because I wanted to try everything.  Definitely worth it and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We've been to Kiku a few times and it's always gotten the job done but our last time there it was absolutely phenomenal. It seems that every time I go their selection keeps increasing and I was delighted to see takoyaki was an option to request which I'd been craving for a long time and it didn't disappoint. The portions are really generous for what you pay and yet at only $2.50 a plate the quality doesn't seem to suffer whatsoever. Like other reviewers have noted table service can be a little slow if you need to ask for something specific but the lady came around and refilled our drinks pretty regularly. I brought two friends with me and they also loved their experience here. I would recommend this place to anyone, whether they are experienced sushi eaters or especially if they are curious about trying sushi for the first time."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place and should have read reviews before i wasted my time and money. Saturday night and not very many people dinning in, that should have been sign!!! Overall nice looking restaurant, cool revolving Sushi conveyor but service was weak and the Sushi looked like it was sitting on that conveyor for a long time. I did order from the menu to have atleast something fresh.  It took awhile to finally place my order and seemed forever to get it. With just a hand full of people it should have been fairly quick to receive our food.

The staff seemed busy playing with their cell phones than taking care of the customers.

I will not be back ."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars because come on, for rotating sushi it's pretty good! And how much easier and convenient can it be?! If you're a sushi snob, then sure you can go somewhere else and find better sushi, but there's no beating the conveyer that is endless sushi. Love this place"}
{"text":"This place is okay. It has a fun factor that makes it unique with the revolving food. 

We went on a Saturday for lunch. There was only one other table when we arrived. It's clean inside with booths and a counter area. We seated ourselves and ordered drinks. The plates on the conveyor are different colors so that you know how much each item costs. At first it was fun watching the items go past and deciding what we wanted to try. After having a few things, it became tiresome. I like to order and then enjoy my food. I found myself feeling annoyed that I had to continue to watch everything go by and make decisions on what else to eat. In that vein, it is more of a novelty than something I would want to do often for lunch.

More people came in over time. It was then that I saw someone being handed a menu. Not sure why one was never offered to us, but we asked for one after we were almost finished. They do have some other items available on the menu along with a list of all their sushi and what is in each one.

Taste and freshness was average. Not the best I've had. Nothing had a wow factor. Prices were a bit high for what you get. We spent about $20 for lunch. That was with water and no dessert. I think we would have eaten more, but weren't wanting to spend much more.

I would recommend this place for the novelty, if you want to try some different types of sushi (since here you can get a plate with just a few pieces) or  you want a fast lunch."}
{"text":"Horrible! Sushi is old and the portions are small. Nothing looked appealing. What we did try tasted obviously off. After spending  $50 we ended up eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Meh. I like the revolving conveyor belt, but I wonder how long the sushi sits out for and how long it's good like that. Instead of offering to heat it up, why don't you just remove the no longer hot items from the belt before customers take them?

The sushi on the conveyor belt was average. The service at the table was decent but the order for hand rolls took too long.

We came because of the Groupon, but there are plenty of other sushi places I prefer."}
{"text":"Came here because my stepson saw it and wanted to try it. Since they don't have a lot of these back East, he takes advantage of them when in the West coast. Choices were good, but since I do go to a lot of these places in LA, it's hard to be partial to the others. They have various colored plates, priced differently, but I think they would benefit in pricing everything the same. I didn't see a lot of the expensive plates so I don't know what they would be and how they would compare to the other, less expensive ones. The girls behind the counter were nice and accommodating of last minute requests and the one and only person taking orders was on point. All in all, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Staff very very nice. Good selection but the rolls were too small and too few for the price.  Menus were dirty. Ok price OK sushi.  Just Ok If they want to make it at that location they are really goign to have to step it up!"}
{"text":"We ate a late dinner here last night.  For our first time, it was pretty good.  The introduction to the restaurant was not great--we've never been to a conveyed sushi restaurant before and weren't quite sure how it worked.  

We ordered an appetizer of fried calamari... It was amazing!  Perfect size and it was only $3.  Then, we began making our selections from the conveyed selections.  Between the two of us we were shocked to see that we only spent $30 (before tip) and that included one sake bomber and a regular drink.  They have a lot of other items that can be ordered from the menu in addition to the conveyer belt.  Next time, we'll try some of these items.

One thing I would recommend to this place would be to have a list that details all of sushi names and their ingredients at the table.  There are some on the belt that do not have the ingredient list on the menu.  This was a little frustrating, but the wait staff were quick to explain the items.  For Instance, Monkey Brains... What the heck?  It turns out it's a mushroom stuffed with spicy crab that's tempura fried.  It was awesome!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say about this place. I love it quite a bit. If you're worried about how long the food stays out on the belt, then this place isn't for you. It's a revolving sushi bar. They do their best to keep up with the demand and switch out foods if need be, and I've watched them do this. I've been here several times since discovering it back in January ('14) and have not once gotten sick from their food. My bf and I usually grab a Cali roll first then a Volcano roll so we can take some of the toppings to spice up the Cali rolls. We both eat as much as we like while barely going over $20, and that's sometimes including cheesecake if we're in the mood.
BUT, if you must have something fresh, you can always tell the servers to ask the chefs to make you a plate of what you want. We had to do that when a couple things weren't yet on the belt.

Also, I personally think it's an interesting place for sushi beginners. It's cheap enough that you can try multiple things without having a huge platter you can't/won't finish. Tried that first hand when I thought I liked straight up white clam (thinking it was like clam chowder)... turns out I don't. But it was 2 pieces and I just set them aside.

The service has always been great and we've become almost regulars with how often we go. And because of this place, we've tried other sushi places but Kiku usually sticks out in my mind if I want something I can rely on."}
{"text":"I'm on a business trip here in Arizona and was craving some sushi and happened to see this place. I'm from Hawaii and originally from Japan where both places have lots of sushi places so I'm like the sushi master when it comes to sushi. Ok, maybe not the master but I know my sushi. 

The restaurant is \"kaiten\" (revolving) sushi where the sushi goes around on a conveyor belt and you select what you want. You pay according to plate color. There were a lot of sushi plates with covers going around on the conveyor belt but not a lot of customers. I figured the lone sushi chef might be anticipating a lunch crowd rush since we arrived a bit before noon.

We were told to sit anywhere and chose the counter. There were no dipping dishes, wasabi or menus on the table and as we were waiting for the waitress to come by the chef asked us if there was a problem. We told her what we were waiting for and she said the waitress would be with us. After getting what we needed, I noticed the menu had a lot of sushi rolls but decided to start with the \"hamachi\" (yellowfin tuna) and ordered it from the chef. I was so disappointed. The fish tasted as if it was previously frozen and that's understandable since this is Arizona but the rice was not sushi rice. It had no flavor. My co-worker got the \"tamago-yaki\" (egg) and he told me to eat the other piece but I refused. He asked me to try a bite and when I picked it up the tamago was paper thin, dry and had no flavor. We decided to leave. The waitress hadn't even brought our drinks yet. When she came with the drinks we asked for the check. 

Our bill was $15 including tip for 2 pieces of sushi, 1 soda and 2 green teas. I don't know about other sushi places here but everywhere I've been has always given the tea for free. 

Though the ambience does remind me of ethnic sushi places in Japan the sushi misses the mark. If you're looking for authentic sushi this isn't the place. If you want to go for the \"kaiten\" and it's unique experience of being able to select what you want from the belt then give it a try but just know it's nothing special."}
{"text":"Pass on this one.

My girlfriend has been here several times with her daughter. She said it was good. We usually go to Osaka, but I thought I'd let her drag me here because it's much closer via bike. 

Seat yourself. That's cool. Waitress took our drink order; their \"special\" (warm sake/tall Kirin Light) on the chalkboard isn't much of a special since it's the same price printed on the menu. Took too long to get our drinks. 

This place is alarming. Having been to revolving sushi in a few other places in California, I was shocked that the conveyor is not refrigerated. Furthermore, we saw many plates that looked FAR past their prime; certainly over 60°F after they make 10 laps around the restaurant. I became immediately cautious after seeing that. But this is what you get in these Chinese/Korean-owned sushi places. They don't want to waste anything, even if that means your butthole will be the victim.

Also ordered a roll, for $13, which was a sad, sad sight. As girthy as a skeleton's pinky and questionable quality of the fish. Total waste.

You can seriously get better quality fish at any Fry's with a sushi staff. And given the myriad of other sushi options just in Peoria, I don't see why anyone would bother with this place. other than for the gimmick of watching plates make laps on a warm conveyor belt. Quality is meh, food safety is a concern and value is shit. Avoid."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Fairly inexpensive sushi.  With acceptable quality.

The fish is fresh of average sushi quality.

I had a several different types of sushi.

Half my childhood was in Japan and know what sushi should taste like.  I've had my share of bad sushi both in Japan and in the US.

The Inari fried tofu skin was canned...though it was rinsed/washed to reduce the canned taste.  I suspected it was canned because the small size.

The Tamago or more accurately Ama Tamago (Sweet [cooked] egg) was too sweet for my taste.  I pretty sure it's a food service precooked egg.  Lots of sushi places use it and tasted it many times.

The Sake or Salmon was near perfect.  Cut size of salmon, quality, taste but the nigiri or rice ball could have been slightly larger.

The Maguro or tuna had itty bitty irregular cut pieces which barely covered the rice ball.

The Tekamaki or tuna roll was actually a Futo-Tekamaki.  Or large roll, quarters cut into 3 narrow slices. Irregular slices.

When I asked for a traditional hoso or narrow tuna roll, the sushi chef looked at me like I was from \"America\".. JK from \"outer space\".

My chief complaint was lack of uniformity in the sushi and presentation expected from a sushi shop even the automated ones in Japan.

They also have several Vietnamese style sushi.

There are also desserts on the revolving service.  

Was not blown over by the cake and raspberry.  It had some sort of fake whipped cream on it.

When I was just about to leave they had put some potstickers on the revolving service.  Covering the pot stickers, can make them go soggy.

I touch my hand to the revolving surface and it was room temperature.  The revolving service should be chilled to keep the sushi fresh.

The servers were friendly and I don't fault them for the shortcomings of the food."}
{"text":"Its what you expect for sushi ranging from $1-$5.  Its a fun experience for sure.  The service was pretty good up until the end of our meal.  We went for lunch on a Sunday.  We were literally the only patrons in there and had each grabbed 3-4 plates and a drink.  Our waitress came to the table to ask if we needed anything else and we let her know we were OK, just picking off the plates and chatting.  Maybe 5 minutes later a teenage busboy came to our table and very rudely asked \"is there a problem?\".  What?! LOL.  OK bro.  It was pretty clear he wanted us to leave.  Again...we weren't sitting there for 2 hours.  It was maybe 10 minutes after we finished eating and still had a little food on our plates.  THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT.  I wouldn't make an effort to come back.  Its not the kind of place you can hang out and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Good cuts of salmon and tuna nigiri sushi! They offer lots of fresh options and hot options. Exotic drinks. Fancy and premium rolls, cooked or raw or lightly seared. Friendly and helpful service. Only $2.50 each plate. No matter the color or roll. All that I had taste fresh and delicious. Only down side for us was no Kirin Ichiban beer. Oh well, food was still good and we will be back Lord willing. Our kids will love this place also. I also liked that they had Eal sauce out for use along with the soy sauce. Good 1st vista. Full now"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the waitresses were very nice. The conveyor belt style of service was both quirky and fun. This is a great place for a date night. And, the prices are awesome. I paid $12 total for about 14 pieces of sushi and a drink! The sushi was fresh and tasted delicious. There's always someone watching the sushi to make sure it's not out too long. Plus it comes on a covered plate. This will definitely be my go to spot when I have a hankering for sushi!!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre. The smoked salmon was pretty gummy and tastless. Items looked old even if the chef just put them down. They lacked the quality of freshness for some reason. Slices were small and the rice was overcooked. Too bad as the concept works well -- no waiting just pick your sushi as it rolls by. I would have loved it here but their sushi is just not worth another try."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite place in the entire world to eat at. I never considered myself a \"sushi snob\" or anything, but I won't eat sushi anywhere else. I find myself craving their sushi almost daily!! Not to mention their staff are all the sweetest, most welcoming people on earth. The restaurant is clean and welcoming and the food is always fresh. I love Kiku!!!"}
{"text":"In town to see my Dodgers spring training. On the way back to our Air B&B stubbles upon this local must try GEM . Awesome food at affordable prices. Friendly and helpful staff made us feel welcome and at home. When I'm back here in Peoria, AZ I'll definitely come back!! If your in the area you've gotta check this place out."}
{"text":"This is the place I'd go to if this was the last place on earth for sushi. I'm giving them 2 stars instead of one because the service wasn't terrible. The sushi on the other hand was overly priced and not many rolls to choose from. I was disappointed after reading the past reviews because there was so much potential. I'm from Seattle so maybe my expectations were too high but I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch for my very first time on a Thursday afternoon around 1pm. The location is great. It is right by the 101 which sets them up for a lot of passer-byers. 

Me and my friend walked in and were immediately greeted. It was a self-seat time. The decorations and restaurant lacked cleanliness and excitement. 

We sat down at a booth right next to the revolver. Our server came up to us and asked our drink orders and left to grab them. We then started the grabbing process. There were a lot of choices and we enjoyed the option of seeing a visual of what we were about to eat. They had appetizers, specials, sushi rolls, sides, and dessert. Nice setup! 

The actual rolls tasted pretty good. As you would suspect, they weren't as fresh and I felt a bit nervous eating off of the unrefrigerated belt. I questioned the likelihood of me catching a foodbourne-related sickeness. They were also pretty cheap and I like how they have colored plates to designate the price.

Other than those fears, I had a good experience. This place is cool for a fist time but nothing to special. :)"}
{"text":"This place probably has one of the fresher seafood in Arizona!!! Not many sushi places are great but this place has a lot of great concepts and it's just plain fun 
You can try every kind of dish because it's revolving 
Having a fun time every time i ear here
I always love the volcano roll and the kiku roll 
Great fish and they have one of the best workers here 
Gotta come by and try"}
{"text":"Stay away!

Let me preface this review by saying I used to love coming to this place.....however, those days are over. 

Tonight, before we walked in, I noticed a sign by the door that said that all sushi plate were 2.50. That was a big change for us, since my BF usually only eats California rolls that used to be 1.25 for 4 pretty generous pieces. Still, we thought that maybe they changed things around to be more cost effective, and since I generally order the more expensive raw stuff, I though it might even out. 

It didn't.

Instead, there was a ton of food circulating through the place, and only 2 other tables eating. The gyoza was cold, the salmon was warm. Nothing tasted like it was fresh, and it wasn't tasty. Even the rolls seemed to have shrunk in size. Even the miso was sad and it was 3.00 a piece!

For a total of 10 tiny plates and 2 miso soups with tip it was 40.00 and we were totally disappointed. 

We only stopped there because we were out running errands and it was a quick place to stop. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, I've been in the food and beverage/ hospitality industry for a long time now so I understand how things work. This review comes from my FOURTH visit. I know people have bad days. Restaurants have bad days. I really tried to like this place. I love sushi, love the concept....

With that being said...the sushi is just NOT FRESH. I've been in there for lunch and dinner now. Each time, me and my company were literally the only people in the joint. The fish was discolored, skimpy, mostly rice, and simply not appetizing at all. My husband told me to grab a Philly roll. I took it off the belt, uncovered it. He put one in his mouth and got this horrifying look on his face. He insisted that I try it. I said no! Lol why would I do that if its bad. I finally agreed. I tried it. It was rancid. Not good at all. I literally gagged. It tasted like cloves and bad fish. I wouldn't even swallow it. It had such a strong rotten taste to it. Hard to even explain. This is coming from someone who loves blue cheese and strong, flavorful foods. I couldn't believe they were serving this. Then we tried this other roll. Dont remember the name. No luck with that one either. My husband said it taste like something out of the garbage disposal and IT DID. Even the color. I'm not kidding. 

Anyways, the building is cool. Very clean, maybe because there's nobody going in to dirty it. The ambiance is nice. Its really too bad the quality doesnt match the appearance and location. I'll be surprised if this place makes it another few months. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"The servers are super nice. Son wanted sushi. 8 pieces plus a four piece hand seared Volcano Roll, all for the price of $6. Yum. Quick, too!"}
{"text":"Conveyer belt sushi ! At $2.50 for all plates ! New menu and I've been coming here for over 2 years and I love it , service is great as well ! I suggest the monkey roll and kiku you can also fresh ones as well ."}
{"text":"Second time here a few days later... we came on a Saturday night and I'm lowering my review to three stars only because of the fact that they were microwaving their fish to thaw it out faster which made the seared tuna special dry and my seared escolar chewy... I have NEVER had seared escolar chewy... it supposed to be soft and not chewy in texture. They were way busier this time and I'm guessing not ready for it so they cut corners and used the microwave... regardless of how busy you are you do NOT substitute quantity for quality. The service was on point but the fish was not nearly as good as it was a few days prior on a slower night."}
{"text":"Their wasabi had no flavor. The manager/owner could have cared less. She was ONLY concerned with a table of Japanese patrons. She ignored our concerns completely. We will not return."}
{"text":"The reviews I read were mixed but I found the service good and the food fresh and tasty.  We'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi selection but most of all the staff was very friendly, inviting and attentive!"}
{"text":"Was hesitant to go in after we drove up and the place was empty but very glad we did. It was around 8 on a Thursday night and they had plenty of good stuff out. The prices are very reasonable, even on beer. Kirin bombers were only $3.50! The sushi was good too. I'm sad I don't live in this neighborhood or I would come here often."}
{"text":"A little pricy for the quality. Only pick the popular items as those that sit on the belt for a while are warm and wouldn't be considered safe to consume. 

Do NOT order the ramen. Turns out to be a bowl of Shin ramen with an egg. All they did was cracking an egg and they didn't even do a good job!"}
{"text":"The worst sushi place! I took a sushi roll off the belt and it was a tuna roll that was green! We had 2 rolls and left, never ever going back! We ended up going elsewhere! Never ever again! I am not a picky person, and when I grabbed a discolored raw fish roll, that was it"}
{"text":"It seemed there was only one waitress for the 15 tables in the restaurant. She seemed flustered. I feel the reviews for the place are not true and if so these reviewers have not tasted REAL sushi.. the experience itself was fun but the food was not to the standard of what the reviews made it seem. Don't waste your time and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very nice place for date night and people who love sushi ! Very cheap for high quality sushi, although some wasn't as fresh as others, i will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Portion sizes are just right so you can get a little bit of everything. I love that I can have so many different types of sushi and not get stuck having to decide on just one roll. Everything was super fresh and tasty! All of the stuff on the revolving sushi bar was wonderful! The salmon was so tasty and tender it melted in my mouth. They also have a full menu and they will make anything special you request as well. Staff was super friendly and the sushi chefs were really great. 

They also have stuff on the revolving sushi bar that is great for non sushi eaters or kids! When I was there they had many different types of salads, desert, fruit yogurt and veggie selections. Or if you don't like whats there just order off the menu!! They are open late which is great if you have a late night sushi craving!

The place is super clean and the set up is really cool. The only thing that they might want to change is to turn the music up just a touch or maybe get some TVs for those people who cant leave home if there is a sporting event on. Other than that everything was perfect. I hope this place stays around for a very long time to come I LOVE it!!!!  

I will be here very very often."}
{"text":"Came in for the second time tonight and had an amazing experience again.  I love how clean and well kept the place is.  They also provided a delightful fruit dish for our birthday girl.  On top of the sushi, the miso soup and yaki soba we ordered were fabulous."}
{"text":"It was way better then I expected. One thing I didn't like was I wish someone would of brought me a high chair instead of my hubs having to chase one down.  I'd go back though."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. The sushi was certainly not fresh and it wasn't very busy so the sushi just sits there for at least an hour before someone grabs it. I was sitting next to the kitchen and I saw the mm place four plates of sushi on the table for about twenty minutes before even setting it on the conveyor belt. I eat sushi often and I have never been so disappointed. I got food poisoning after eating here so I will certainly not be coming back. I recommend trying a different sushi place."}
{"text":"This place makes me happy happy! Haven't had sushi this way since living in Japan a couple years ago. Takes us back. Warms our heart and fills our bellies. It's a must try! Happy hour all day every day! Only 2.50 most plates! Some items less!"}
{"text":"It's the first time I've experienced revolving sushi! I didn't know what to expect when I walked in, but once I did and sat down, I was so excited to dig in. Plates are very reasonably priced and they have numerous sushi plate options to choose from. Will be coming back for sure, and telling others."}
{"text":"I popped in for lunch while running errands and found the best Philly roll I've ever had!!!! Omg super fun way to try new sushi rolls without breaking the bank. The plates are clearly marked for price and each section has a flag for what the roll is, they made it so easy. I will certainly be back and will bring family and friends. Bonus they serve alcohol!!"}
{"text":"Yes , I will give this restaurant an OK.
 My date and I filled up for only 20 bucks with ice tea. Service was very friendly.  Rolls good sized and plenty of variety.  You can order direct and not from the cool revolving track.. 
For a quick lunch go. For a fancy tasty dinner.. Not really... The taste should have more flavor...    Yes we would go again.."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place in Glendale area!!! 
Awesome customer service best chef in town!!! 
All sushi and rolls are $2.50!!!!! Why spend more money for another sushi restaurant. Try once here you can't go any sushi restaurant. I love it here!!! Come back tomorrow!!"}
{"text":"I just had a fantastic time and really enjoyed the sushi, over at and kept eating more."}
{"text":"Very tasty, great selection, prices, and service. I'm thrilled to have such a place on the NW side of town."}
{"text":"1st: hours are wrong.  Closes at 10.
Anyway, came in tonight for a bite. Living in Seattle, I have fairly high expectations of sushi. Especially when it is a revolving type establishment.  Nothing except the deserts looked even remotely appetizing on the revolving belt. Every mini plate looked dried and old.  
I decided to or to full size rolls off the menu. Same price for any full size roll (12.99 each) a bit more than I pay in Seattle.  
The cherry blossom roll was very good. The lollipop roll was different.  Edible, just don't think I would order it again.  
The prices should be updated on the menu. I noticed the plaque at table and the menu listed different prices for each color plate. Otherwise a quiet place to eat."}
{"text":"Very good tasting sushi. I walked in as they opened and they were very friendly and helpful as well. I sat down and grabbed a variety of plates and began eating. I wish I didn't get so full quickly! I would have loved to try a lot more. 

Great sushi place. I would definitely recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Nice conveyer belt with various sushi on it. The plates determine what you pay as they are colored different thus different amounts. I have not seen a sushi place like this before in the Phoenix area, this remains me of LA or SF.  The sushi was ok some better than others, you have to keep an eye out for plates that have been on the conveyer belt for a while since these may not be as fresh. Overall, this is an interesting find and the kids get a kick out the food on the belt.  Just be careful how much plates you take off the conveyer belt these add up quickly."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews, but I had to! :(

When we walked in no one was there, I was thinking crap this can't be a good sign? I felt like the place was way over staffed. They had servers just walking around everywhere? It was kind of odd. 

The idea of a revolving sushi bar intrigued me. I think the idea is cool, but not smart when it comes to anything that has been fried in tempura or baked. You HAVE to serve it fresh, or after awhile it's just gets mushy. It really grossed me out.

They said anything that has been sitting out for 2 hrs is thrown away. I really don't see how this place will stay in business with the cost of food and the loss. Seems like such a waste.

My two year old had a chocolate pudding ,and I was jealous HA!"}
{"text":"Honestly a great place to come try lots of different types of rolls and sushi. They have all the popular rolls vegas philly along w some originals. Their fish for ghe nigiri tastes fresh. Their desserts included the soft koriyama cheesecakes along with mochi ice cream. We will be back again amd again. Owner is super nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner for a girls night before going to the art therapy next door. Needles to say, I was very pleased.

We sat down and we spent a while looking at the food go by to see what we wanted. There's a wide variety of sushi and other foods. All the plates were $2.50 which is a killer deal. They also bring out wasabi for those that are into thst

The only thing I can say wasn't spectacular was that it took a while to get drinks and refills. Other than that it was a great experience and the staff was friendly. I got 3 plates of food and a water for $10 (that's with tip and taxes).

I would definitely come back again with other people to share the unique experience for a great price. If you love sushi and want to try more amazing sushi, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place, at 7 she really likes the food moving by and pickings something off to give to Dad.  The sushi is so-so, the staff is very warm and friendly to us and helps out anyway we ask.  They do have a couple of specialty rolls you won't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"My family tried this place for the first time today. It was empty when we walked in, now I know why. The sushi was not fresh tasting. Bland choices that looked boring. We ordered a volcano roll that had this nasty, ground up seafood-ish slop on top that tasted strange. I really hope I don't get sick after eating here! Too pricey as well."}
{"text":"I'm new to sushi and this wasn't the best... But it's close to home and inexpensive. We enjoyed ourselves and the service was great! Elizabeth gets 5 stars. She recommended sushi and different sauces to compliment the mix, she was attentive with our drinks and checked on us frequently. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This was the absolute WORST sushi I have ever had. It looked bad, it smelt bad and it tasted even worse. I was honestly afraid if I finished what I had pulled off the belt I might have gotten sick. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and will never ever return."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Good server.  Clean and lots of variety.  My kids got a kick out of the revolving belt."}
{"text":"Update: I went back again at a later time. The place was pretty empty. 
Service was slow and kinda bad. I think the person was new and didn't really know what to do. 
There was mold on the fruit going around and also the salad was wilted and brown. 
Would never be going back...."}
{"text":"Always fast, friendly and fresh!  I seriously need to buy stock in this place because I eat here so much.  I love the variety of rolls and the prices!  I don't have to settle for 1 or 2 long rolls with one flavor.  I can have like 6-8 plates with all different sushi!  I love it!"}
{"text":"Went out of our way to go here and was very dissatisfied. There were lots of choices and the food was okay. The problem was we were not greeted the entire time. We sat ourselves and watched as other customers were greeted and offered drinks and a menu and were brought wasabi to go with their sushi. We sat with our stack of plates for a half hour before being asked if we were done, which was the first interaction with the wait staff since we walked in. Then it took another half hour before the bill was brought to us. The waitresses walked past us numerous times, ignoring us, even after raising our hands and saying excuse me. They then brought our bill finally and as soon as we left, took the receipt. I'm assuming to see if we tipped (totally unprofessional). Our bill was $50 which fed 3 hungry ladies, and it was NOT worth the hassle. You could go to Panda Express and get better service. I've never been so ignored and disregarded in a restaurant. I was NOT happy at all."}
{"text":"Went in, one other party was there. Their poppers were cold, they said they could heat them up for me. You don't heat popper, they are double the price and half the size of Teharu in Scottsdale. 

Surprisingly the iced green tea wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Brought out of town family from Los Angles! We had a blast and food was great with great prices."}
{"text":"Expectations of a place creates the review. If you've ever been in a revolving sushi bar, you know that it is the \"buffet\" experience of the sushi world. However, they are required under law to maintain a high-level of freshness. In this case, for less than $25, Marcie and I were able to experience great service, sample several types of rolls and salads and had ahi tuna sashimi. There is not another sushi place in the Valley that can compete with their pricing. 

All that said, I don't think we'll be heading their for fine dining but, that's not what this place is all about. They provide quality sushi at a great price and service with a smile. Not to mention, we were in and out in less than 45 minutes. 

We certainly recommend Kiku for a lunch or lite dinner outing..."}
{"text":"very clean & the staff was great. we will not be returning though. it seems like a good deal at $2/plate but those were the smallest rolls ive ever seen. the rolls werent bad but they were all room temperature. hiraku in tempe is way better"}
{"text":"I've been to several conveyor belt sushi type places, and I understand that sushi that travels around on the conveyor belt is not meant to be the \"elite of the elite\" sushi. I've been to some pretty fancy sushi restaurants to true \"authentic ones\" to AJ's grocery store type sushi places, I am really not picky!  I appreciate the finesse of what sushi restaurants can come up with.

Here, although the service was great. The rice was pretty hard on the rolls. The fish just came out really dry. I really wanted to like this place and my husband and I brought my dad here on a  Sunday, and my dad was so disappointed with the sushi, he almost made a scene! I quickly ate a few rolls that I got off the conveyor belt and quickly had my husband get my dad out of there to another sushi place nearby where my dad could order his favorite \"masago roll topped with quail egg sushi.\" I explained to him that this sushi place didn't have rolls like that there. They have their own specialty rolls there. However, I couldn't help the fact that my nigiri - mackerel sushi or was it snapper? but anyway, it was dry and chewy. The restaurant just opened that morning and the fish already seemed dry! 

I might give this place another chance, especially without my dad, the sushi snob. I just like having this gimmicky type of conveyor belt sushi as an option on this side of town."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here because we've never been to a revolving sushi bar. We went during lunch on a weekday. Our waitress was very nice and checked up on us once in a while. 

Unfortunately, the sushi was not up to par and was expensive. Each plate had 2-3 very small pieces of sushi on them. The plates ranged from $2 to $3 and up. The fish did not look fresh, and we had no idea how long the sushi had been rotating on that belt. 

Many of their rolls just seemed like regular california rolls with random fruit slices like kiwi, mango, and strawberry put on top. The rest just didn't look appetizing. Needless to say, the sushi didn't taste good. 

While I was there, I saw a few gnats flying around the sushi (but the sushi plates are covered with a plastic cover) and was grossed out. 

The bathroom looked new and clean, but there was an array of air fresheners inside that were too pungent. Also, the toilet sprays water out of the pipe when flushed. 

I had high hopes for this place, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I would rate zero stars if I could. Me and my family just ate there and it was really disgusting. I really don't have any other word for it. The conveyer belt was not refrigerated and let me just tell you that the sushi had been sitting out for a while. And there was so much that was out! Enough to feed about 40 families. And I went during dinner time, it was only my family of 3 plus 2 other people inside. Not a good sign if no one is there for dinner. None of the sushi at all was being refrigerated. The worse thing of all was a spicy tuna roll that I got, the second I put it in my mouth it tasted like metal. That's a bad sign. Someone could get very very sick off this place. Please do not eat there."}
{"text":"This place is interesting. Ive been here twice now with two very different experiences. Basically if you when they are busy you should be good to go, enjoy the food, experience, and overall atmosphere. I love the idea of revolving sushi, but I have the same concerns as other reviewers on here. My second time came when at dinner and it wasn't busy at all. That's odd I'd think sushi should be more crowded at dinner but that's beside the fact. The food looked like it had been spinning for a while. You could physically see the degradation of the item choices after a while. I sat there and there were plates spinning since I walked in and it took us about an hour to eat. Which gets me worried how long my food was out before I got a chance to take a snag at it. We ended up ordering special, and more importantly, made to order rolls which was nice of the restaurant. Overall the food is great when it's fresh and it's typically not an overcrowded space with fair prices. I'd recommend but I wish they would ip their game."}
{"text":"Reminds me of Genki Sushi in Hawaii but the service is very slow. They had a quite a large selection on the belt and you are able to order anything as well, but it took a really long time to place our order because there was only 1 person managing all the tables. Then when we go our order it was missing items. The prices are super cheap on the sushi, you cant beat that. The Teka Maki (Tuna Roll) didn't taste very fresh but the Tuna Nigiri was excellent. My husband tried a lot of the mysterious sushi's and thought they all tasted great. I'm sure we will be back but will make sure we have extra time to account for the slow service from them only having 1 waitress to take care of all the tables :)"}
{"text":"Fun concept of revolving sushi (as it's more common in Asia).... but the sushi tasted skunky.  If you've ever smelt a skunk that sprayed its nasty scent around, then you know what I'm talking about!  

As some others noted, some sushi is warm.  Yuck!  The prices aren't bad ($6 for 22oz Kirin and sake) and $2 for plates of 4-pieces of sushi wasn't bad.  Surprisingly, I'm not fond of skunk and won't be back."}
{"text":"Grab your life preserver, folks....what we have here is a sinking ship.  We decided on a Sunday afternoon that we were in the mood for Sushi.  Finding ourselves on the far west side and hoping for a new experience, we decided to give KiKu a try.  We are already fans of conveyor-belt sushi, which we consider to be a quick, convenient, fun and kid-friendly way to do sushi.  Usually conveyor-belt sushi places have different prices for different colored plates, and the different plate prices and colors reflects the quality and expense of the sushi on that plate.  This place currently has all plates prices at $2.50 a plate, no matter what you are eating.  This could be a bargain, if there were ANY of the higher-end rolls on the belt...but there weren't.  Not a one.  Almost every roll involves crab mix.  The one I saw that didn't involved spicy tuna, also a cheap filler.  The rolls with raw fish involved have very small portions.  My daughter wanted basic California rolls...these are usually the cheapest roll.  They are $1.75 at Sushi Station, cheaper during happy hour. Here they are $2.50 for rolls half the size of the sushi station ones.  The portions here are TINY.  It was $2.50 for a literal handful of edamame.  Worse, the temperature of the food was off.  The squid salad and cucumber salad were both warm enough that I was concerned about food safety.  The sushi here is boring, expensive, with small portions and of suspect quality.  Nothing redeeming.  The service was also terrible; the waitress did not give us plates, we had to flag her down for soy sauce cups and wasabi, and this was with us being her ONLY table.  They had signs on the wall that parties of 6 or more would be charged an 18% gratuity....remember, this is a conveyor belt sushi place!!!  Your server just brings you drinks and your total!  Not worth 18%.  Our party was only 3, so this did not apply to us, but nevertheless seems an unusual policy for the nature of the restaurant.  We were never offered a regular menu to order off of, if they had one.  After reading the other reviews, it is clear that what is going in is that this place must be struggling.  It seems that they have changed their prices and their policies and their menu, and are cutting corners.  I bet they will be out of business within a year.  I felt ripped off from this meal.  Our family decided to \"cut and run,\" not even being full and certainly not satisfied with the quality of the food, but still our bill was more than we usually pay at the other sushi places we frequent (and not just Sushi station....we also like Mr. Sushi, Hanas, K-Sushi, Ra, and even the takeout sushi from grocery stores is much better.)  Go elsewhere people, don't waste your money, let these people sink their own ship, no need for you to get wet."}
{"text":"PLEASE dont hesitate at the 3.5 stars. This place is under new ownership.

I've been coming here for years and I have never had a complaint. The sushi is always fresh and delicious, and with the cost and portion size revolving sushi offers, you get to try everything you want instead of choosing only a roll or 2 for the table."}
{"text":"New establishment around north west of phoenix. They have allot of sushi with fruits and the price is affordable. Sushi rice did improved since the last time I came here. It use to break apart when I pick them up, now its more dense. They have no wait list and they let you choose where you prefer to sit down."}
{"text":"The all the staff greets you and thanks you for being a customer which is so respectful and nice on their behalf. The sushi is a really good price and they have all kinds. I think the coolest part is their cute desserts they offer like macaroon ice cream sandwiches and the traditional Japanese mochis. They also have anime and k pop music on their tv's all the time."}
{"text":"I have never been to Kiku Sushi personally, but I am now working all day Saturday instead of having the day off because my employee who was supposed to be here went to Kiku last night and now he, his girlfriend, and her daughter are all puking their guts out.  STAY AWAY!! I wish zero stars were possible ..."}
{"text":"I've been to one other location in California and loved the sushi, price, and the experience so I figured I would give this location a try. Big mistake! They are definitely not all created equally. The sushi was not fresh and our waitress was extremely rude. Anytime we asked her for anything she seemed to be annoyed and would make a face. I gave one star for the concept and one star for the price. However, I will not be going back. I like my sushi fresh and the people serving me polite and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great find in the Arrowhead area!  Prices are very affordable and fresh sushi is always around you. First time at a revolving sushi bar and it was a fun experience. Didn't have to wait for food, just picked it right off of the conveyer belt. Staff was extremely courteous.  Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"If you want descent sushi fast and easy this is the place to go. Yes there are better sushi places in town but for the price and speed of friendly service this is a good place to eat. My kids love the frys and chicken strips as well."}
{"text":"This was a fun lunch trip. A nice variety of rolls, nigiri, and side dishes were on the conveyer belt. They kept up and restocked the belt when plates were taken off. Even desserts were on there. Once you sit you just watch for what you want to come your way. There are descriptions of each item, and most plates are $2.50. Nigiri plates had 2 pieces. Other plates had 3 or 4 pieces, depending on the type of roll. Made it easy to try new things without having to pay full price for a full roll if you're unsure. We enjoyed being able to just grab what we wanted. You do order drinks and any hot food or ice cream desserts from the server.

This is a good place for casual, mid-priced rolls. Don't go in expecting super high end sashimi if you know what I mean. Food was tasty. No complaints about freshness. I love how they offer mochi ice cream (really tasty), macaron ice cream sandwiches, and japanese ramune sodas.

This can be a quick stop if you want it to be. We noticed several people, seemingly on short lunch breaks, walk in, eat, pay, and leave in under 20 minutes.

Wish we had started coming sooner. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Great happy hour for saki bombers. The young man that served us was very polite, great service. I will return."}
{"text":"Used to be pretty affordable but the prices keep going up and the quality is really starting to go down. Used to really enjoy this place but now I need to find a new sushi place. :( tonight it tasted fishy and not very fresh."}
{"text":"Idea was fun and efficient. Sushi was good. Rolls were fresh because some fried rolls were still steaming. Service was great. I would recommend and I will be going again. Very fair prices"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We brought our 4 year old daughter and she thought it was the coolest thing to see a revolving bar. Everything we got was fresh and tasted delicious. It's nice to find a sushi place that's not overpriced especially for my family of 6. We will definitely be back!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever!!!! I visited this place in hopes that it would be as good as a rotating place by my house that I'm a daily goer to, and this place exceeded my expectations! They have such a variety of options for the sushi eater! If you ever visit, order the strawberry sushi--yes sounds weird but I love it! So different, my favorite spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Most disgusting sushi ever.  As each dish came forward on the conveyor belt, it was like watching some bizarre game of chance.  Not really knowing if the next bite was going to make you sick(er)...."}
{"text":"I love sushi and have been to several revolving sushi bars around the Valley. I was in the area of Kiku and thought I would stop in for a weekday lunch. I sat by the bar- my server was nice but not attentive. After waiting 15-20 min for sashimi, I ended up asking the owner what happened and she gave me some free miso soup. I appreciate the effort but the soup was terrible. The sushi unfortunately wasn't good quality so everything tasted off. I wanted to like it but the salmon sashimi literally was 3 different colors. All of the revolving sushi I ate was warm and that surprised me because I got there maybe 30 min after opening. For a $30 lunch plus tip, this was really disappointing. 

Overall, if you really like sushi, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"This is just a really cute sushi place. The staff there are very welcoming. I go here every month with all my friends and we always have a great time. The food is also really good."}
{"text":"This is a great place for fresh sushi had a great deal. Me and my girlfriend went there and had at least 10 plates from the revolving sushi. They were all very good and the price was definitely a great deal. I would give this place a five star review if the server was more attentive to our beverages. They were a little understaffed because our server was taking care of 10 tables and she had to clean off the tables as well."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've ever had but it was cheap and there was a large variety. At between $1 and $3 for each tapas-sized serving, you can try several things without breaking the bank. The conveyor belt is fun too. A hidden gem in the Arrowhead area of Glendale but worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Kiku is a great place to eat at, their food is amazing and the service there is simply wonderful! 10/10 recommend Kiku Sushi, definitely going back there soon!"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, fun atmosphere, great prices!
The revolving conveyor belt is awesome!"}
{"text":"I been there before and I believe is under new management , so now every little plate is at 2.50 . Food quality is AWESOME ! Taste is AWESOME ! But the service is NOT good at all, if you are patient then your waiter will come around to offer you a drink. I miss having the menu entrees but again with everything that is going on in front of you . Please try the ice cream wrap , it's different but worth it. I am glad that is under new management the changes are for the better."}
{"text":"I have been craving sushi for months, but no one that I know like it. Saw this place heading to work today.....Nice comfortable atmosphere....... I like that conveyor-belt idea although I prefer my items not be pre-made, but the sushi is way too \"Americanized\" for my taste bud. And the worse for me is to find cream cheese in several of my choices. Price was good considering the small portions, but seemed processed and tasteless. I dont want to sound to harsh but after the overall experience I would probably not go back .............. just really did not enjoy any of the 5 different rolls I tried today."}
{"text":"Place is clean and nicely decorated. My waitress seemed inexperienced and Left/quit after taking my order. The lady in charge did not know what I had ordered and it looked like they hadn't made it yet.  
As for the items on the conveyor, I cannot see how they could be fresh. 
I did order from the menu so that the food would be fresh and it did taste good but..
Won't be back."}
{"text":"My hubby and I ordered take out tonight some sushi and a teriyaki plate, however, our order was not correct and the food was not very good. I ordered 2 rolls, but for the price ($6 for 4 pieces) is way over priced for what you get. Fish is gummy and doesn't taste very fresh. I can get an entire roll somewhere else for the same price maybe a little more. Also, my husband ordered steak teriyaki and when we opened it.... it was chicken!  We had to pay extra for the steak we never got! The was the first time eating here and it will be our last."}
{"text":"Been here twice with hubs, mid-week, mid-afternoon. Service was quick & attentive, friendly. We both enjoyed the wide variety of choices on the carousel. Food was fresh & well-prepared, very affordable. With the small plates, we were able to sample bites of sushi rolls we wouldn't ordinarily order. Several of the rolls use crab salad - but, hey! it's a discount place! 
We'll be back - not just because it's in our neighborhood, but for a fun & delicious dining experience."}
{"text":"Horrible. Service was terrible, waited 15 mins for a water and never served the sodas for the kids! Food was subpar, they didn't even serve salmon, only smoked salmon...lol. No inventive rolls, everything was either a cali roll base or spicy tuna. Only saw thin tuna sushi, no other fish. Don't bother, drive to Sushi Station! Waaay better than this place! I asked for the check, paid for the few plates we ate and headed down the 101 to Sushi Station at Desert Ridge."}
{"text":"Loved it  great food and perfect for the price people are crazy for saying that it was horrible they prob have the money and no taste buds to spend their money somewhere else where they would prob pay triple the amount that u would normally pay here I loved the fact that the owner was there cleaning his restaurants stools shows that he genuinely cares about his business he was very nice and welcoming highly recommend this place I was stuffed and me and my husband spent twenty bucks great deal"}
{"text":"The food was pretty amazing for the price and Omar was a very friendly, helpful server!  We ate until we were stuffed for $22, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time here and must say we were impressed after reading how bad some other reviews were. Its great for a quick bite and the sushi was plenty fresh. Out of the 8 dishes we only had one we didn't like. Service at Kiku was great and place is well maintained. We'll be going back again!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but came for lunch and was very, very underwhelmed. If you want revolving sushi definitely consider Sushi Station instead. 

Rolls: Too much rice, all the crab was fake and overpriced.
What really bugged me was that the majority of their specialty rolls were just rolls with FRUIT on top of them (mango, kiwi, strawberries) for $1 more. I'm no expert but I'm pretty sure I'd get sick if I ate that type of combination. 

Fish: Tried the salmon nigiri, and it was alright for $2. The fish wasn't funky tasting but it was also cut very VERY slenderly. For that reason I would not buy that again. 

Service: Average. The waitress kept asking me if I was okay, probably because I simply didn't like anything on the belt so just watched the food pass for about 20 minutes.  Very awkward situation. 

The bill wasn't that cheap, the food wasn't that good, and I will not be back. If you know anything about good sushi you'll agree."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place it's not necessarily the greatest sushi ever but they have lots of variety the price is amazing and the quality is very good if your gonna go get sushi this would be my top suggestion"}
{"text":"Our first time at Kiku was over lunch on a Wednesday about 12:30pm.  We are familiar with sushi-train places and to our suprise there was no other people eating lunch and the sushi train was full of food.  We decided to eat here anyway and I chose to take items from the train and my wife ordered off the menu.  It took forever for her meal to be served and by then I had already gone through four plates of sushi.

I ordered hot tea and was served a tiny cup of tea with no offers of refills.

The prices of the sushi-train items had one price on their menu and another price on the free standing sign on our table.  When I asked about that they told me the higher price was the correct one.

Finally three other people came in to eat.  This place is not very popular.

The also had a big no firearms sign in the window, don't they get it that armed customers make the place safer.

We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Most carousel sushi places start ok and then turn lousy. Kiku has done exactly the opposite.  Fill up on AMAZINGLY good sushi for under $15 per person.  Tired of cold items that ought to be hot?  Yeah, they fixed THAT problem.  Instead of putting hot items on the carousel they put a picture that says \"REQUEST THIS ITEM HOT\" A simple change that fixes the #1 problem with carousel sushi.  We ate there last night.  Love the stuffed Jalapeno dynamite sushi, and the scallop-topped rolls.  I'd only give the maguro nigiri a 7/10 last night, I've seen better.  But I've also paid $10 PER ROLL at fancier places.   You got a sushi jones?  This is the place.  Affordable, VERY good, and only $2.50 per plate.  I'm giving this place 5 stars, something I don't do lightly.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is amazing! The waitress was very friendly even the chef was talking to us and very nice also. Very reasonably priced for the quality! I recommend to anyone! The chef made special off menu orders for us to try."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Conveyor belt sushi. Happy hour all day every day. All plates on the conveyor belt are $2.50! The sushi was super fresh and yummy. Many options. And you can order a special roll if you want. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!!  The revolving bar is fantastic,  food very good and fresh, even when the restaurant want full,  they kept it stocked.  The staff was very friendly and made sure our drinks were never empty and I didn't run out of wasabi,  which I use a lot."}
{"text":"I didn't just want to believe the reviews of this place but they are pretty spot on. The sushi is all warm, the restaurant is warm. The service is pushy and not good. Grabbed octopus off the line and the smell after lifting the lid off the dish was BRUTAL. We sent it back and all the kitchen staff got into a screaming match over the octopus quality. It smelled disgusting. 

They also buy all of their desserts from Costco and mark them up several hundred %. Plenty of better options in the area. Won't be returning ever."}
{"text":"This was a delightful place to go with my 6year old! We are the fresh and variable types of sushi, got to watch anime, and the place was not crowded! The staff here were super nice and it was awesomely priced. A great place for a date or just to hang out I think!"}
{"text":"Ate late last night - We were the only ones there at about 8pm on a saturday night. The food was okay, but nothing out of this world. I was impressed that they had saba and a few others ready to go, but I think that I would only return when it is busy because I can't see how the rolls could have been fresh. It's not bad if you order and have them prepare it on the fly, but at a Kaiten sushi joint you don't expect that you have to. It is slightly hard to find (behind a few rows of buildings actually!) and signage is minimal until you reach the area (3 parking lot areas deep!)  Maybe that is why it was empty.  It is really clean, and nicely decorated inside and the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is great. further then two other places closer to me. Worth the drive. Great friendly staff"}
{"text":"This is a great place to take your family.  The kids love choosing their sushi and pulling it off the conveyor belt.  We dined at a place like this in Hawaii and were so thrilled when they opened this one here.  The staff is EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Went on a double date night with my best friend Jenn and her husband. We were in the mood for sushi and something different so we tried a conveyor belt sushi place. It was definitely big! There were so many options to choose from. The one thing I didn't like was how fast these belts were going. It ended up giving me a headache from staring at it too long. 

I tried the Vegas roll (my staple), a veggie roll, and a tamago roll. None of them were anything extraordinary. The Vegas roll needed more filling and the batter was really thin. It crumbled as soon as I got it. My veggie was the better one out of all of them. The best part of the meal was dessert. They had a delicious red velvet cake that was excellent! We ended up spending over $70 on 2 people. This includes two sake bombs. 

The experience is what you really pay for. I liked the fact that you just sit and pick out your food from the belt but it went by too fast and if you stared at it too long it makes you dizzy! The sushi itself is ok. Not the worst and not the best. Tokyo Lobby is still my number 1 sushi place to go to."}
{"text":"Sushi was tasty and fresh! Great service for a revolving sushi bar (which doesn't require much attention). They have a plate system which consists of multiple colors showing different plate values."}
{"text":"The prices went up a super tiny bit! But it's still really rad sushi. I come here way too often."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time great experience! Loved seeing what I'm buying and before I eat. You just grab as you go. Great food! And only $2.50 a plate. And you can get other stuff other then what in the belt going around as well . With drinks and beer too. We will be back with friends! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Loved this place and can not wait to go back! The prices were reasonable and the food was great. We tried six different rolls and were stuffed. Everything was fantastic.The sake bomb was good and so was the plum wine to top it off. There was hardly anyone in there but it was nice to have a lot of different choices to pick from. I wish we would know all the rolls on the belt but I would continue to eat more!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest sushi but it's good. It's inexpensive. $2.50 a plate. Food seems to be always fresh.  The service is attentive and helpful. I love the conveyor belt."}
{"text":"Decent place. 

I like the vibe here, it was actually better than I expected. The sushi was decent, actually lacked a little variety I felt, but it was ok. Not a bad place for the west side (which lacks everything). 

Otherwise they do have a regular menu, and beer as well. 

I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with one of my good friends. I've been craving sushi for months now and we've been here before so I decided to return, it wasn't bad.  I regret going though I'm a fan of sashimi and nigiri so I naturally went for those first. It was warm and tasted off. My friend said it might be because they use fresh rice and don't give it a chance to cool so it accidentally warms up the fish.  Aside from that, the rolls and nigiri had no flavor. It just tasted like overly sweet rice. I got a roll with wasabi mayo and hot sauce and there was no flavor or spice at all.  

Aside from bland and warm sushi, I came home and have felt sick for the past hour.

Super disappointed, will probably be going to Fresh Wasabi in Surprise or Stingray in Glendale. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to several revolving sushi places in Hawaii. I love the concept of something original and different. The sushi was good. Not awesome but good and seemed to be relatively fresh. There is always the chance of not getting fresh sushi when its traveling around on the conveyor belt, just watch what they are putting out and pick wisely. If there is something different you like they will make it. 
The prices are phenomenal. You pick the food you want and the prices line up with the color of the plate. How easy is that? So two people for dinner plus dessert was $13. That's total not each."}
{"text":"The idea behind this place is great. The ability to just pick the food you want separate from the other people in your party is common place for other types of resturants but sometimes sushi can be a little different because of price and roll sizes. I think it's wonderful that the plates only come with smaller roll portions or the traditional allotment of nigiri so that you can try more things. The digital menu for specialty items and the delivery method are entertaining. I appreciate that you can check-in ahead of time thru the app!"}
{"text":"Revolving Sushi Fun!
We go here on a weekly basis for lunch. It's super fast, great service, endless supply of cheap sushi. Definitely better than what we make at home. :)
They are constantly trying to add new things to their menu. 
Everything is fresh for the most part. The only thing I've seen that wasn't was the edamame - but I've seen the same problem at upscale restaurants in Scottsdale. 
I've never had a problem with the temperature of the sushi and we come here about once a week. 
Service is great. I love my wasabi and the girl happily brings me more. 
My kids are in love with sushi because of this place. They are excited to eat sushi at Kiku but won't eat it anywhere else. :)
We are loyal customers!  Great place for fast and basic sushi. If you want the fancier stuff, you won't get as much of that here."}
{"text":"Update: My teenager asked if we could give this place another shot, so we did. Not sure if the place is under new ownership, but wow! What a BIG difference! It's clean, the sushi was fresh and tasty, the waitress was very nice and we had a great experience! Glad we gave it another try.


Dirty, overpriced, and total crap sushi. We ordered drinks, had two plates and left. The waitress was and imbecile, the table was sticky, dirty floor and the staff seemed to be in their own world. We went elsewhere and would not recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Love the revolving sushi idea. Wished they had more variety on rolls the same ones kept coming by and a bunch of desserts"}
{"text":"A darling sushi place with good inexpensive vegetarian options. Nice staff and a very cute atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really liked the revolving sushi concept. It was a great way to try different and new sushi for a very reasonable price. We had nine different items and already have several we want to try on our next visit. There's plenty of variety and it's perfect for trying new items."}
{"text":"As a big sushi fan, I really do enjoy this place! I come here very often and leave satisfied every time. If the item you want is not on the belt at the time or if you think it might have been on the belt too long, they have no problem making you a fresh plate! Everythings really tasty, really fair prices and staff is very sweet."}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here pretty often and with such low prices I hope they continue to stay in business."}
{"text":"Decided to not pay any attention to the reviews and just try this spot out. Should have went with the reviews. Restaurant is warm, sushi is warmer. I picked out some octopus and once I lifted the lid off, the smell was similar to a dirty fish tank if you have ever smelled one. I warned one of the ladies working that the octopus was severely stinky and she took into the open kitchen and I sat as all the women bickered over the octopus and how all octopus is \"supposed to be smelly\". Never ever going back. & the sushi quality is comparable to Fry's Grocery Store."}
{"text":"Can't complain about this place! Interesting environment with Japanese shows always on the TVs but all of the plates are very good! You can't beat the price for quick good sushi."}
{"text":"We have been big fans of sushi station, but this place has higher-quality and lower prices. We showed up at 9 o'clock and they made our sushi to order. It was excellent."}
{"text":"Girls Night Out!  

We had a lot of fun!  With the revolving sushi, you're able to try so many different items.  Everything was fresh and delicious, especially loved the salmon...it was like butter!!

All the revolving plates are $2.50, which is incredible for the quality of the sushi.  The menu also had other items, but we didn't get a chance to try any of them.  If hubby had joined us, he would've ordered off the menu (he's not a sushi fan).

Will definitely be coming back...had a blast!!"}
{"text":"Fellow Phoenicians...and love ones who visit, I would like to set up a lunch date with you post haste to come here with me! It's a revolving sushi joint with great service and excellent prices. 2 1/2 stars? What the hell do my fellow yelpers want for $2.50 a plate?! I mean come on, there are revolving tiny delicacies spinning like a Japanese rockabilly '45 all around you. This place is completely on point. I had the freshwater eel and it was delicious. This place is by far the most affordable option anywhere in the area. Let me give you example; a 22 ounce bottle of Sapporo is $3.50, a really delicious house large picture of sake is four dollars. You can get a INCREDIBLE deal by ordering a sake bomb, which will you get the same 22 oz. Sapporo or Kirin and 2/3 of a large picture of sake for only five dollars American!! KiKu roll and the Eel were excellent but by far my favorite dish was the mini fried octopus. You must try that dish. So we got 10 plates of sushi and an assortment of yummy's, 2 big Sapporo's in a bottle, and two large pictures of sake for $40.98. Beat that, I dare you. Our server was a sweet young girl named Marisol, and she was very attentive when she should be and not there when she shouldn't. A rare skill."}
{"text":"Revolving sushi, is exactly what it sounds like. You sit at your table and a conveyor belt runs next to you. There are five price points based on plate color, ranging from 1.00 to 5.50. For the 46.00 (not including tip) price we paid we could have gone to our regular sushi place and had better tasting sushi. Service was fine, drinks were refilled on time."}
{"text":"Very dope concept of having a revolving belt of sushi. Wish we had that back home. The food was all good and you can't beat $2.50/plate."}
{"text":"I love how you just pick whatever you want. Each roll is small so you aren't stuck with just one big roll. You can try more, and if it's not your favorite, it only cost $2.50. And you don't have to wait to order and then wait for your food.... it just keeps coming by on the conveyor belt. Super cool. 
Will definitely be back.
Ok... update...
We come here like 1-2 times a week 
It's awesome"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. The food was cold. I tried to get it redone and they charged me extra for it. The service was poor and they were rude, none of the food was fresh."}
{"text":"This restaurant was fun. Enjoyed it with coworkers. The sushi was pretty good not the best but for the price we paid, the taste was pretty good. The price was amazing. I like that we did not have wait but there was no one there which was surprising. The raustaurant was clean but the water cups could have been cleaner. They were spotty. I would go again for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever eating at a revolving sushi spot and I left with a very good impression.  Here are my pros and con:

Pros:
Staff was friendly and attentive. 
We were greeted immediately upon arriving. 
The place was clean.  
The rolls were yummy and had a really good rice ratio.
Inexpensive ($1.50-$5.50)

Con:
I took off one star for the quality on their sushi,  but what do you expect from a revolving sushi spot. 

Overall, I had a great time and left on a full stomach.  Thanks Kiku!  Next time I'm in town,  I'll be visiting for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!   This sushi place is unique!  I don't know why it has 3 stars?! It must be from hipster down-voting it because its not pretentious enough for them.   Basically the place has a conveyor belt that has little plates of sushi.  Each plates  will range from $1-$5.  Each plates usually has about 3-5 pieces of sushi unless nigiri sushi.

Anyway, its a perfect place for people who eat sushi alone or with families because you can sample many different types of sushi for little cash. 

The only bad thing is the quality, while I have had better sushi in phonix, the price here is inexpensive."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to try out one of these places because I don't really trust sushi sitting out for a long time. After talking with the sushi chef he assured me they toss the food and replace every 2-3 hours and they also have the option to make it FRESH for you for the SAME PRICE which is awesome. You can chose any plate for $2.50 yeah, that's right $2.50 I even got cheesecake desert, pot stickers, and edamame as sides to my 3 different rolls I ordered. Everything was great tasting and fresh! The Saki bombers were 5 bucks which was the most expensive item on my bill. Overall my bill was under $30 dollars for a lot of great food and a saki bombers, that would have easily ran me $60-$70 at any other Japanese restraunt.  I will definitely be back in the future and I have recommended lots of friends and co workers to this place as well, all agreeing the food quality and price can't be beat :)"}
{"text":"Very nice idea. My favorite was the Vegas roll. Can't go wrong with deep fried sushi. The waiters were on point and took care of me right away."}
{"text":"All day happy hour so all conveyor sushi is $2.50. The taste and amount of sushi is so much better than their competitors.  You can tell they use quality sushi rice and it is seasoned well.  The sushi chefs are friendly and servers was nice. 

I brought my friends here for my birthday and everyone thought it was delicious. Some never been to a revolving sushi restaurant and thought it was fun and fast.  I brought my parents and my Japanese stepmom is very picky with her sushi. She gives this place her approval and even wants to bring her friends here so it is a good place to try it out. 

New owners recently here so they said they will be updating menu items.  I will have to come back to try out more of their menu items.

Update: My parents are hooked and go here more now. They love go almost once a week.  There are new sushi plates so we find something new to try every time we visit.  We also like to special order sushi (see new pictures)."}
{"text":"I used to like to come here for quick and cheap sushi. Not sure I'll be back after today's experience... tried to order a fresh roll (which you are welcomed to do) and instead they tried to be sneaky and give me one that had already been made and revolving around for a while. I spoke to the waitress about the issue, the sushi chef and lady assisting him were not willing to come out and speak to me directly."}
{"text":"Great sushi place. The revolving bar is a cool experience and I like that you just sit down and start eating. Staff was friendly and attentive. A lot of the plates has cream cheese in them but you can order from a menu. Prices are decent and the food was good."}
{"text":"This was such a great experience for sushi! The have tables, booths, and a sushi bar where you can sit to eat. Watch the sushi merry-go-round and pick what you like. All kinds of sushi and rolls, as well as hot items like shumai, gyoza and egg rolls.  If you don't see it, they will make it!
 It was about $40 for 2 of us WITH beverages. The octopus sushi was a bit chewy, tho. Everything else was delicious. They also have flat-screen TV'S playing Korean music videos  and Anime. The servers were attentive and friendly, too."}
{"text":"This place is 'okay'. The decor is nice and and not too tacky. We came here on a Sunday at about 12:30pm. 

Let me start out by saying we were promptly greeted upon entering with a smile and a  'welcome'. You pick your own seat and basically get started. 

I didnt order anything off of the menu because they seem to be kinda pricey for things like chicken fried rice ($8.99), which my boyfriend ordered. He enjoyed it and said it was really good and cooked perfectly. I still felt like it was a little pricey for rice and a few pieces of small chicken. 

There was a huge selection of sushi revolving around which was nice. However Im going to question the freshness. Im going to guess that they didnt take any of it off since they opened at 11am. I tried the unagi and it had a very fishy flavor (as in it was past its shelf life). 

I also chose the California plate, Spicy tuna roll, and the salmon skin roll. All were good, but not really fresh. 

My biggest complaint was our waitress. She was very pushy and wanted me to order something from the sushi bar. She hinted at it twice. I didnt really want to pay 12.99 for a specialty roll. Pretty nuts. She also seemed to be disheartened that we asked for lemon water instead of soda. We try to remain healthy so water is our first go to. She also seemed very disappointed we only chose one dessert plate. 

I glanced at a few of the other rolls as they passed by me and I could tell they were over due for a trip to the garbage can. Especially the ones in which the plastic casing on the inside started to sweat. A few of the 'strawberry' topped rolls were started to show signs of age, the strawberry toppings were wilted and almost looked dehydrated. 

Revolving sushi places out here dont do so well. Because they cants really make their money off of the revolving plates. So they try and make up for the loss by charging alot for off the menu items. But Im sure if you come right as they open youll have a better experience, and fresher choices.

We'll probably give this place a second chance but we will come early in the morning."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!! My friend recommended this place to me so I decided to check it out. The restaurant that I normally go to for the revolving sushi experience is Taharu. However, it's a bit of a drive for me and this restaurant is closer to my side of town. So I thought to myself why not, I'm up for something new. This place is kind of hidden and it was dead when my friend and I were seated. The service was good but i rated it one star because of the food. I can tell just by looking at the sushi that it had been out for few hours. Tuna didn't look fresh and looked brown, avocado was brown, and even the fruits looked a bit dry and old. I picked up a vegas roll from the conveyor belt and after taking a bite from it, I had to spit out my food instantly. It tasted like I just drank pure oil and after seeing my reaction, my friend took a bite from my plate and made the same face. We only had about 15 plates and the bill came out to be around $75. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! With the same amount of money, I could've enjoyed my dinner at a nice sushi restaurant. OH also the restaurant was having issue with their computer, so we had to wait an extra 30 mins for them to process our payment."}
{"text":"First time visit and differently retuning. Each
Plate is fresh with a wide range of selection tasty items to choose from. A must for anyone who loves sushi and rolls. Deserts 

Second visit update. Wife and I enjoyed a evening enjoying some sushi. What a surprise to find they added two new dishes. We both highly recommend the Red Mountain Roll and Ahi Tower. My wife described the Red Mtn Roll as a party in her mouth. 

Love the food, but please tone down the music."}
{"text":"Meh . . . We ate there this afternoon, pretty average stuff in my opinion."}
{"text":"Warm sushi, dirty menus and booths. Poor service. Unless you're broke and craving sushi I would not recommend."}
{"text":"This to place is the best sushi in town.the food us great and staff are best . I'll definitely coming back for it."}
{"text":"The food was on the conveyor belt for a very long time. Even though the place was quite busy I did not see the staff pulling off food from the conveyor belt that had seemed to be on there a long time nor did I see them putting on fresh food onto the conveyor belts. I purposely sat near the kitchen area where they were putting on food. We were there for over two hours and only saw them put on fresh stuff twice."}
{"text":"I stopped here for some take out. Simply put, the sushi was edible, but not great. The food was just tossed into a box. No wasabi, sauces that actually came with my rolls or ginger were included. The prices for specialty rolls (which are the only ones available if you want take out) are way too high.$12.99 for a full roll. This rivals any of the better sushi places around. I had both the orange and cherry blossom rolls and neither tasted very fresh. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Don't know why they get only 3 stars. After founding this place I will no longer need to drive 40 minutes to another revolving sushi restaurant. They have best food and best price here, and also a best distance that near my house!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the service is pretty good too. The whole concept of a revolving sushi was great and excellently executed. This is a great place for a get-together."}
{"text":"Only three stars because I was concerned about how long the dishes stayed on the belt. The items we ate were good but some were warm and some were cool, noting very cold or very hot. 

The staff was courteous and answered our questions. I think this is a great place for a group of friends not my idea of a date night."}
{"text":"They were very friendly & aways checking if we needed anything. Very good service even better sushi."}
{"text":"I can't lie, my roommate wanted to go here and I was a bit skeptical. Sushi aka FISH rotating around a conveyor belt at room temperature for god knows how long!? How can that be good!? 

Ahhh, but it WAS!

It took me a second to grasp my head around the concept, but once I did and was able to jump into the rotating saucers of flying sushi I was pleasantly surprised. I had a California Roll and (I think) a Shrimp Tempura Roll and they were both yummy! I've actually had worse sushi from nicer restaurants.

My roommate tried something different and was satisfied with 3 out of the 4 plates she grabbed. She didn't touch but once piece of the last plate and when she mentioned that she didn't like it the lady helping us removed it and she didn't have to pay for it. I thought that was nice.

Our experience was a pleasant one. I would definitely go back to get my sushi fix :)"}
{"text":"Everything has Krab in it. Not that exciting. If you are into deep fried everything and crab salad, this is the right place for you. They even put Krab in the spicy salmon rolls, as garnish on the cucumber salad and anything else they feel like stuffing it in. Not a fan"}
{"text":"I don't want to say that some of the other posters are liars and posers, but if the sushi fits... 

The place is nice on the inside, a little hard to figure out with a lack of direction from the staff. However, the staff is friendly and helpful, but you've gotta ask, and try to bring your nose down to eye level when doing so. 

The spicy tuna is pretty good. The fruit topped is weird but tasty. My family of 3 usually eats for about 25.00 total, and leaves with guts busted. Never been sick, never smelled skunky food. We've only had the revolving, other than the softshelled crab, which is admittedly a little skimpy. Most dishes are 1-3 bucks, and you get like 4 pieces. I think it's great for variety. They've got deserts, drinks, sodas, and everything else you would expect. 

The sushi chefs like it when you talk to them, but I guess you'd have to pull your head out of your butt first. 

If you're a fan of sashimi, korean bbq, and other stuff like that... GO TO THOSE PLACES. This is a conveyer belt sushi place with plates that range from 1-3 bucks. You can't eat coal and expect to fart diamonds."}
{"text":"A delightful place with a unique feature. The revolving bar goes around the tables and allows customers to take what they want when they want it. Kiku Sushi allows you to choose the sushi you want without having to order and entire plate of 6-8 pieces. You pick up the plate from the bar which gives you 2-6 pieces of sushi per plate. There is less chance of you wasting the food and a better chance of you to get only what you love and try new things. The service is friendly and helpful. They all take great care of the customer. Another great thing is that of your sushi gets taken up by other patrons you can always just ask the waitress to have the chef make you your order instead of waiting for the dish to come around. They really want to make sure everyone has a great and filling experience."}
{"text":"I had a great experience! Server was very attentive! It is a fun concept and the prices can not be beat! The only reason I dropped a star is because the fried rolls on the belt are cold. After we got one we just ordered them custom out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Price-wise it is not bad.  Selection was minimal.  Staff was very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"Love this idea but the sushi is subpar and the experience is mediocre. We were the only table in the place and our drinks never got refilled and we rarely got checked on. Half of the rolls were missing so the selection was sparse. We special ordered 1 roll and they forgot to make it. All items that should have been warm were cold as they had been sitting out for an hour already. We did go at 2:30 and it was a slow time, but the experience was not great."}
{"text":"Bad service. The server did not smile at all. Food isn't great. The fish was not fresh at all. Overpriced for the portion. Teharu is definitely better."}
{"text":"INTRO:
Ugh this place is so bad. I will never be back. 
I'm not from Arizona, I'm Asian, and I'm from a state that sells the freshest sushi. ***F.Y.I: I am a straight forward & honest person***

PROS: 
-Prices are cheap
-We were seated immediately.

CONS:
-Ahi nigiri was fishy. I mean fishy (sushi experts if ya know what I'm talking about).
-Rice portions on the nigiris are so small.
-Rice was hard.
-That creamy orange sauce on the maki rolls tasted like thousand island salad dressing (plz don't tell me it is). It was WEIRD.
-I like my sushi cold not room temperature. 
-I normally get lobster makis but I disliked how they shredded up the lobster meat & added onions too it. 

I WOULD RETURN IF:
-They come up with a different creamy orange sauce.
-They sold homemade gyoza and shumai. Not the frozen ones from the Asian grocery store.
-They didn't shred up the lobster meat and add onions.
-They gave more rice."}
{"text":"We must have caught them on an off day...service was bad, barely any sushi on the belt and we couldn't order typical nigiri you find in other sushi restaurants. 
Not very good."}
{"text":"I would like to think of myself as a sushi connoisseur. I've been to all the expensive places and to lots of holes in the wall. But I would have to say I freaking love this place!!!! I've been to one that's similar but their selection and choices of sashimi and sushi rolls is so much greater than any other conveyor belt sushi place I've been in the valley. The options are great. The quality of the food was fresh and tasty. When we walked in the entire restaurant greater us and made us feel right at home. I don't live anywhere close to here but I'd make the 30 min drive just to have this place again! I'm so excited about this find. Did I mention the most expensive dish is only  $2.50?!?! You can't go to any other sushi place and expect to get freshwater eel/ unagi for less than $15. So this place is a steal!"}
{"text":"This was my first revolving sushi experience so the novelty of it was really cool. The sushi however was just alright. Pretty good for the cost but if you're craving some high quality sushi, this is not the place. Lots of options with crab, maybe too many as I'm not a crab lover. I would go again, but not my favorite place to grab sushi. I should add that it was clean and the staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm sad that I've been in this area since January and I only just now discovered this place, exactly two weeks before I have to move elsewhere. This place is amazing! You walk in and are greeted by friendly staff who directed to either a table or a bar seat. The most amazing thing about this place is the vast amounts of different plates rolling around the train. Everything is labeled very well including those things that should be ordered hot and they prompt you to talk to your server. 

They have so much to choose from! I'm not kidding when I say that this place is completely worth it. All plates are $2.50 which even though it is higher than what I am used to at my old place in Portland, I would say the quality is better and very much worth it. My old place had everything at about 65 cents cheaper but this place feels much more fresh and definitely worth the extra money. I would recommend the octopus inside the potato balls. I want to say it's called Takoyami? Totally worth it! Give this place a try as you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I think I go at least once a week and the sushi is always fresh and delicious, the prices are right at $2.50 for EVERY plate and the staff is so friendly! Some of my favorites are the Marilyn monroll, rainbow roll, and the KiKu sushi."}
{"text":"Update May 2017: Don't let the 3 star review fool you, under new ownership, this place is arguably one of the very best sushi restaurant in Arizona!

After my favorable review back in 2013, The sushi slowly started getting worse and quality overtime, with dry fish and dried rice at times, until the startling huge improvement with the recent change of ownership.  Now this restaurant shows what real sushi lovers enjoy about amazing sushi!!

Prior to the change of ownership, I have not been back here in a few months. I heard from my friend that the restaurant has changed ownership, and that the sushi was much better than before. I decided to try it again two weeks ago, and was amazed at the quality of the fresh sushi and the rice. I decided to come back two more times in the last two weeks.  The sushi has been amazingly fresh and amazingly tasty every single time.

The salmon sushi is extremely tasty and creamy, apparently due to a change of suppliers where the new owners use a special salmon that is typically not used in restaurants of this caliber. There are new sushi items such as a sweet shrimp (amaebi), a favorite of mine, and I have posted pictures of me eating half a dozen plates of the delicious dish.  Almost every single sushi menu item has been improved to be fresher, tastier, and worthy to spoil your taste buds.

I just returned from a visit to one of my other popular sushi spots in California - KULA revolving sushi, which is legendary with its 2+ hours wait times, and amazing fresh sushi at any price.  I visited Kiku Sushi shortly after my KULA sushi visit, and found the Kiku sushi worthy of my time and money.

The owners are true fish connoisseurs, knowing where to source the best fish to serve.  As a special treat, I was treated to a taste of real Red Snapper, which blew my taste buds away.  I usually avoid Red Snapper, since it is tasteless and flavorless in most sushi joints.  The owner gave me 4 pieces of Red Snapper, and oh my, it has instantly become one of my favorite sushi items immediately. There is a rich and sublime taste of the ocean and fish, with the taste echoing in my mouth for a very long time after eating it.

The owner explained that most sushi places substitute Red Snapper with Flounder or other cheaper fish, which is why the sushi is so bland and tasteless. This has opened my eyes to how real Red Snapper should taste...and it impresses me upon the knowledge and connections to the best fish sources that the owners have.

If you have not been back to Kiku sushi in a while, or have never visited, you owe it to yourself to come and taste the sushi.  You will be amazed at the change in quality, with some of the tastiest sushi you have ever had.  You can thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"I've been to several revolving-sushi places before, including Kula in LA and one in Tokyo.  I love the idea of KiKu, but the execution was a bit off.  The selection was average to below-average, not in the sheer number of items, but in the diversity of the selection.  For example, there seemed to be a whole lot of the same type of roll with a different topping, instead of changing up the ingredients of the roll itself.  

The service was decent and would make you anything you wanted if it wasn't immediately available. I was surprised that there were only a handful of people there at noon, but happy that the selections still looked and tasted fresh.  

Bottom line: it wasn't my favorite, but I would go back. I'm hoping for a slightly better choice of items next time around."}
{"text":"We've been coming here well over a year, have never had a bad experience with the freshness of the sushi - thinking that perhaps conveyor style served sushi might be questionable, but, never a problem.  And if you don't see something on the belt, just let the staff know, and they'll make it up for you.    We like it because of the amounts of sushi served - we can try several kinds, varieties..Granted, this is not a 5*, but for a quick sit down, clean, friendly establishment, we like it."}
{"text":"Food was just as good as Sushi Station except the plates were all $2.50 and less the travel being that I live in goodyear. Very friendly and attentive staff. No complaints and would highly recommend to others"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really bad!  The selection on the conveyor belt looked like it's been sitting there for hours.  You could see the avocado starting to brown on some of the rolls.  Baked mussels ($2 for 2) only came in 2 not 3 like the menu says and the kitchen staff forgot to cook the darn thing.  It came out cold.  The waitress apologized but that was really unacceptable.  The miso soup was at room temperature.  The $1 plate selection was limited.  The seaweed salad was very fishy tasting.  1 cup of fruit cocktail for $1.  2 pieces of unagi for $5.  This place is a total joke.  Very pricey for crappy food.  I will never return.  If you like conveyor belt sushi, I would recommend Teharu Sushi in Tempe instead.  Not the best sushi you can get but it's a great place to eat a lot of sushi on the cheap.  It's also very busy, meaning more fresh rolls on the conveyor belt."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean. The tables weren't sticky and everything was well organized. The sushi was good; it wasn't the best obviously, but they had a great selection and some interesting combinations. As someone who likes to eat, it wasn't a great value. The cost adds up very quickly. But, I'm very thankful to have a revolving sushi on the west side of town."}
{"text":"My best friend and I have this our GO-TO Friday night friend date place! The prices are great but the FOOD is also great! If you aren't satisfied with the sushi riding by, you can order it FRESH for the exact same price!

The sushi chefs are friendly, the waitstaff is amazing, and the owner is super sweet! Check this out!

I'll be honest, it isn't \"the best sushi EVER\"...but it IS \"the best sushi for THAT LOW PRICE\"!"}
{"text":"My kind of place! Food was great and being \"newer\" to sushi I got to try some new things that I really liked. Staff was friendly and attentive.  I finished it off with a cappuccino macron that was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is fun and delicious! There's food for fish lovers, people that don't like sushi, and even vegetarians. I lived in Japan for 5 years and there were places like this everywhere with the revolving sushi, really made me miss my old home. The waitress was attentive and everything was a a great price. You could come here on a quick lunch break since most of the food is already prepared. Don't let it scare you, everything that was meant to be hot was and everything meant to be cold was. Very sanitary. I'm so excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time last night, and had a good experience. It is a revolving sushi bar, not a 5-star sushi restaurant...so don't get your hopes too high. The sushi was delicious, and there was a bunch of it on the belt, so many options to choose from. However, if you're pregnant or can't eat raw fish, you don't really have many options to chose from, so buyer beware. The chefs were constantly making new rolls, monitoring food, and our waitress was very helpful and always checking on us. If you don't see a roll that you want, they'll make it for you and give you the same plate price - pretty neat! The reason why I gave this 4 out of 5 stars was because this revolving sushi bar is a little more expensive than other revolving sushi bars. The plates are about $0.75 more expensive then where I have been before (Teharu in Scottsdale). Definitely give it a try, but don't be a snob."}
{"text":"This place was great! These other reviews with low stars must have walked in expecting Tomo or other high end sushi. We had Las Vegas, Crunch, SHRIMP tempura to name a few and they were fresh and fantastic tasting. We will definitely be back again! If you are looking for some a cheap sushi fix to cure your craving I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sushi here is not fresh at all. Tamago was probably one of the worst that I've tasted. The other sushi were just barely passable (quality on par with that of supermarket sushi). I question the turnover rate of the sushi considering there were just 3 tables occupied and probably over 30 plates circling around the conveyor belt. Luckily, we didn't have any stomach issues at all like the reviewers, but we were hoping and praying that we wouldn't! What kept this from getting 1 star were the service (they were actually somewhat attentive) and the price. Then again, I guess you do get what you pay for, right?"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Is the sushi astounding? No. Is it good? Yes! And it's cheap. It's decent food for a good price with a cool setup. Our son loved the conveyor belt with all the food."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service not so much. There is one waitress, been there for a long time and is very friendly. All the cooks are friendly and always greet you. There is one waitress who barely speaks english with glasses who is absolutely terrible. She never refills drinks, cant understand what you are asking and is always in a horrible mood and seems bothered when you ask for something. Last time I waited so long for a refill on my drink that I got up and got it myself, while she sat at a table wiping lids. With how many other sushi restaurants in the area you would think they would value their customers more, this waitress not so much. If I make the drive to KiKu again and she is our server I will just leave and it will be my last visit. Real shame"}
{"text":"Love this place! Nice and friendly environment. It's $2.50 per plate which is quite cheap and their sushi always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat!! 
Best sushi place in town! 
Staffs are verry friendly..
I will definetly come back!!"}
{"text":"The concept is fun and makes for an entertaining night out.  However if you know quality sushi, this is probably not the place to go. I'm from California, so maybe sushi is fresher there.  Some of the plates were fishy tasting or they looked dried out. I wouldn't go back-"}
{"text":"Firsr time for revolving sushi..food was fresh and great and service were great too!!  5 of us, family went for early dinner and ate 35 plates!!!  I hear it was under new ownership..Owners seems really nice. We will definately come back.."}
{"text":"Came in today for lunch with a group of 10 people. We're part of a Sushi \"Meetup\" group that travels all over the valley. We found Kiku Sushi had good sushi, is reasonably priced, and had very attentive service. We will be including Kiku on our rotation and will be back in the near future for dinner. Interested in joining a group of people who have the love of sushi as a common interest? Check out our website at:

{"text":"I was able to enjoy fresh options as I was the first customer of the day. Many of thr dishes I desired were made before my eyes, I never got the chance to order them. The quality was great and the selection allows for new adventurous tastings. For the price, it is far above average."}
