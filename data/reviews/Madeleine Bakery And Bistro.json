{"text":"This was my second trip to Madeleine's. I love that a bakery moved into the neighborhood. It is located right at the corner of Trenton past Biddle's Escape. 
The decor inside is so beautiful. It was a nice day so they also had several tables with chairs set up outside. They have free wifi. 
On both of my trips I purchased a loaf of sourdough- the multi grain. It is SO good. All of their pastries are perfectly displayed and look incredible. This trip I also got a piece of quiche. It was just okay. I would keep coming back for their breads. For Regent Square they are reasonably priced. I'm not sure why I don't come here more often."}
{"text":"An amazing little bakery! Charming atmosphere and delicious baked goods."}
{"text":"Very cute bakery and I've enjoyed the crossiants I've tried. The crossiants have a great flavor but they are a bit pricey at over $4.00 a piece.  We've tried to go for sandwiches 3 different times and two occasions they've been sold out (at 2pm) and the other time it was too early (they don't sell them until 11am). They also were sold out of almost all their baked goods by the mid afternoon as well.  It was frustrating but I know they are new and still probably trying to get a handle on production. Probably going to try again in a few months and hopefully the kinks will be worked out."}
{"text":"Great Croissants and lots of options. The service is so great and friendly. I live within steps from there and I would go there every day. At least I will try to lol"}
{"text":"The croissants are great. I bounce between regular croissants and almond croissants. Nice and flaky, nice light shine, great taste.

I also tried the little chocolate cakes. They were good, but the croissants are better.

They also have coffee and French sandwiches, but I've stuck to the croissants."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been coming at least once a week since they opened. The bread is delicious and fresh, and all of the pastries are super delicious - the croissants and so crispy and flaky! I cannot say enough about how tasty everything I've tried is. The sandwiches are delicious too. The only bad bing is that there's not a lot of seating if you wanted to stop for lunch. Otherwise awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Best croissant outside of France. And scones that were buttery and delicious! Friendly staff and a nice space - with parking on the aside. Go give it a try."}
{"text":"Small bakery with authentic French feel. Their baguettes are the crunchiest, their croissants melt in your mouth, their pastries are not over sweet, and their peanut butter cookies have a few real peanuts AND there's a sweet brittle crunchiness thing going on there, yum! I love that they play music that I've only heard in French Cafes. These sweet girls have opened their own bakery, and they've done it in a very tasteful way!"}
{"text":"Excellent new bakery in our neighborhood! Very friendly staff and delicious pastries. I especially like the chocolate chip cookies and fresh loaves of bread. Hopefully they add more tables and chairs to expand their seating area."}
{"text":"New to the area and much needed. Convenient and the product is very good. Super cute location."}
{"text":"This place is so charming and cute! It's a great addition to the neighborhood. I stopped on a snowy afternoon. Parking was easy to find which can sometimes be difficult. I wasn't sure where the cafe was because the entrance and is on the side and they didn't have much signage out front. The inside was small but adorable. I got two brownies, two Madeline's (lemon cookies) and a scone for my boyfriend for $10. The brownies and Madeline's were hands down amazing! Small in size but rich in flavor. They had other stuff like cookies, breads and sandwiches.  I hope this place makes it. I'll be coming back in the summer to pick up some snacks before going to play in park with my daughter."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to discover this new bakery while walking to Biddle's Escape to meet someone for coffee. On my way home I joined the line inside to pick up a chocolate croissant and a kouign amann for later. The pastries are large, so the price is worth it. The staff were friendly. Payment was easy. I'd like to come back some time for a sandwich, or a loaf of bread, or a hot drink. Looks like they are still figuring out the logistics of table service/clean up, but I heartily hope they succeed."}
{"text":"This is such a special place! The atmosphere is perfect. It's clean design and French inspired vibe is so inviting. White subway tile and wooden shelves. It's located in a cute building with a few tables and chairs outside for the warmer months that I will surely be frequenting. Although I only tried a miniature dark chocolate brownie and a Madeline cookie and both were very good, everything else looked just delicious. The croissants were giant and the the big cookies were so tempting. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their baked goods!"}
{"text":"So thrilled to have this delightful bakery around the corner in my neighborhood! So far, I've tried the classic croissant, the Madeline's, the peanut butter cookie, and most recently, the almond croissant. (Maybe I should cool it on the baked goods? ) It's no exaggeration to say they've all be HEAVENLY. This is going to be a regular spot, without a doubt"}
{"text":"Everything is fantastic and the decor/atmosphere feels spot on for an authentic French style bakery shop or bistro. It is close to regent square and right by Biddles Escape.

The baked goods are fantastic (I'm partial to the sea salt chocolate chip cookies) and the workers are all so friendly.  This is a must visit!"}
{"text":"It's lovely to have a bakery in the neighborhood. The breads and sandwiches are wonderful, and I can't wait to try the pastries."}
{"text":"I've tried nearly every baked good here so far. We live in the neighborhood, and we were very excited anticipating the opening of Madeline. I'm not an expert on French baked goods or anything, but whatever they're doing, they're doing right. It feels like a privilege to have a neighborhood bakery, and the shop is so charming and welcoming. 

I currently have zero complaints. It's a new business that offers something incredible and necessary to the community, and their product is delicious. 

Their Madelines are certainly special and perfectly textured, so if you only try one thing, try those. 

We need this local business to flourish, so I'm excited and happy to tell anyone and everyone about the yumminess inside this little shop. (Oh yeah, and it smells amazing when things are baking! Just a bonus.)"}
{"text":"I read of Madeleine's on Yelp, and as it's not too far from my home, decided to try it. Okay...maybe it was some of the sweet tooth and love good pastries and treats thing too. In any case...it's a bit challenging to find for the traveller, as Trenton Road is split and you have to approach from the correct way. Once found, parking is a little constricted, but you'll find a spot. The bistro is basically \"once you've found it, you know where it is\". 
Bottom line, it's worth finding. Cozy, quirky, and of its own character, Madeleine's is its own brand of local shoppe...unique! The young lady at the counter was asked to provide me with a selection of goodies, and she did very nicely, explaining the pastries and being both accommodating and polite to this first time patron.
The few tables were full of what I suppose were regulars, and the woman behind me, learning this was my first stop by, raved about the place, assuring me I'd return.
Having now tried a couple of their selections - including the namesake treat - I have to agree. I will be back. 
A very nice little spot!"}
{"text":"My toddler son and I stop here so often (it's in our neighborhood) he has learned what a bouchon is and starts asking for one as soon as the bakery is in eyeshot. At like, a dollar a piece I have no problem saying \"yes\" every time.

The staff is friendly and helpful, the prices are beyond fair and the baked goods are STELLAR. Parking can be a challenge, if you need to drive in, but it's totally worth it. Support small, local, businesses!"}
{"text":"When it comes to homemade right on site you can't go wrong here. Madeleine's is a small bakery and bistro where you can purchase all types of baked goods including breads, cookies, scones, and even an egg special. As the name implies it is French inspired so look out for those delicious pastries!

Free WiFi is offered. You can eat either in house or order take out. They do take orders for holidays and special occasions. Prices are very reasonable and staff is happy to explain everything to me. They serve sandwiches, soup, and salads as well. You can also get coffee or tea.

I wanted something small so I ordered their breakfast egg dish along with a chocolate bouchon. Believe me it was just enough and delicious to the last bite! I did not realize this place is located near Regent Square and sits a block away from Biddle Escape. 

They offer free WiFi and have gender neutral restroom available. That sour dough apple coffee cake looked tempting but I knew that I couldn't finish it. Some of these pastries are extremely large which makes it great for sharing or take out.

This is a welcome addition to a neighborhood I'm seldom in but gives me a good reason to return and check out the other offerings they have. Free street parking is available but it does go quickly."}
{"text":"Words can not explain how much I love this bakery. I'm not a huge scone fan, but Madeleine Bakery changed that. Their sweet and savory scones are amazing. The texture is perfect. The sea salt chocolate chip cookies are fantastic. I have to give it up for the croissants though. This is the place you want your next chocolate croissant. I was also lucky enough to grab some bee stings. Don't miss out on this gem on Trenton."}
