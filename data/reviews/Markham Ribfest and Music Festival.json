{"text":"There were 8 ribbers at the fest, making it fairly difficult to choose.  Finally, we went with half racks from Hogfather, Billy Bones, and Crazy Canuck Smokers.  My fave out of the three was Crazy Canuck.  Their ribs were mildly sweet and savory.  My husband liked Billy Bones more, which had more of a bite with spices and smokiness.  Each definitely had their own unique flavor profile.  Crazy Canuck chicken was pretty good too.  You will have to pay $2 admission fee, but keep in mind that this is a charity event sponsored by the Rotary Club."}
{"text":"Nice place to go to with your family and friends during this time of the year if you love bbq ribs and pulled pork. Happened during the last weekend of June. Bought a full rack and a serving of pulled pork to share. The ribs were really awesome - finger licking good. Would love to go there every year."}
{"text":"This year, the ribfest moves to downtown Markham, next to the cinema. This is the first year that they request for $2 admission fees per person (in more than 5 years). I bought my ribs from HogFather where the line is short. The ribs actually are not bad, the meat is tender and you can chew on the soft bones but the sauce is kind of on the sweet side. It will be better for me if the sweetness can be reduced slightly and the grill the ribs a bit longer to maintain a dryer surface on top of the meat."}
{"text":"Ribs! Ribs! Ribs!   I've got to say that there really isn't anything else as fun and satisfying to eat than ribs when you're having a party with friends and hungry!  The Ribfest is a great way to get an assortment of different ribs, all in one location. Coming from all over, there are different kinda for everyone. Just make sure you are ready to line up. For a long time. Some lines may be shorter than others, but they all take quite a bit of time.   With the lines out of the way, there definitely could be more vendors, as there are only about 4 of them at the Markham Ribfest each year.   Either way, its a great way to get out and about, and eat some great ribs!"}
{"text":"I come for the experience. The ribs were tasty, and if you don't eat ribs normally, it's delicious. For about $14, you can get a half rack."}
{"text":"We visited each rib station in order from left to right.  The first one we went to was Billy Bones BBQ.  They boasted \"best sauce runner up\" in 2015 and \"best ribs runner\" in 2014.  It was really nice that one of the guys there gave us a short spiel on how their pork ribs are simply the best.  Out of the ribs I tried that day, I really enjoyed the ones from Billy Bones BBQ the most."}
{"text":"This is a smaller version of the Toronto ribfest.  Only one stage rather than three and not as many rib stations.  It's also situated on cement rather than grass.  Other than that it is an enjoyable festival, interesting bands, even some Chinese performances."}
{"text":"I went on the first day and it was great.  They had the 6 ribbers along with the corn stand, lemonade stand, Greek food, funnel cake, fruit juice, beaver tails, fries and blooming onions.  They also sold beer, had a few booths selling items and the rides and games.  I tried the Kansas City ribs and their sauce I find is the best hands down.  The cut of ribs isn't the greatest quite fatty but the sauce made it so so good.  Further, their cornbread was on the small side but good, and their coleslaw was a bit on the bland side.  Overall with a family of four count on spending at least $100 for drinks, ribs, and ride and games.  It's always nice when it's near home, but the Oakville Ribfest was much bigger and the lines weren't as long.  I suspect tomorrow and Sunday will be much much busier.  Happy ribbing!!!"}
{"text":"I am a yearly visitor to this Ribfest. This is one of the smaller ribfests, but one of the most organized.  This year, there are 6 ribbers: Bad Wolf, Brickyard, Billy Bones, Crazy Canuck Smokers, Gator BBQ, and Tennesse Fatbacks.  The line-up for Crazy Canuck Smokers was the longest, however we have tried all these ribbers in the past except for Billy Bones BBQ, so we tried Billy Bones BBQ this time.  Me and my fiance got the Ribs and Pulled Pork sandwich combo for $16. I wasn't expecting that the combo comes with a bun for the pulled pork, but I was glad when it came with one.  As always, tasty, juicy, saucy ribs and pulled pork! :)  There are many other sellers / food trucks if you prefer to also try other foods and desserts: Beavertails, Funnel Cakes, Corn, Greek food, Lemonades, Burgers, Burritos, and Coconut drinks!  I find that there isn't that much seating this year, and it was hard for us to find a place to sit down, even if the place wasn't even as busy just yet.  Busiest times would be from 7PM to 9PM. Line-ups are loooong.. but so worth it!  Review 85 of 100"}
{"text":"This is my second year attending and the Markham Ribfest is definitely an event to visit if you like food, music and are nearby.  There's plenty of parking at the Markham civic centre itself or around the nearby buildings right across the civic centre, but that's for Friday evening.   I went with Bad Wolf Barbeque this year after trying out gator, and some other ones from the previous ribfest around and about and it was enjoyable but could have use more barbeque sauce. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and deliciously smokey. The cut I got seemed to be on the fatty side unfortunately but that's okay, it was pretty darn good. The lines for crazy Canuck were the longest, all the ribbers are mostly the same and consistent not only in quality but in price. But for a safe bet, go to the one that has a respectable sized line for 'fresher' ribs. Prices are $24 for a full rack, $14 for a half. Share if you must!  If you don't like ribs there's still plenty of other vendors in the form of food trucks so there's plenty to choose from. Drinks are also present in lemonade, bubble tea, and coconut water.  ONE huge star deducted for the lack of the best chip truck in the world, Prince Edward's Fries which was there last year and was supposed to be there as per the ribfest site map. I'm so disappointed! Anyways, I ended up getting fries from that fries stall and they were utterly terrible. Soggy and slightly over-fried fries. Medium was $6, portion was all right albeit on the lower side. Prince Edward's they were not.  There's plenty of seating sponsored (?) by the Markham Rotary Club, who I will give a shout out to as they have certainly played or have played a big role in these and past events. There's music playing, it's a very relaxed feel there, and there's some small rides and games for the kids. It's definitely a family friendly event."}
{"text":"Went to Crazy Canuck Smokers for a half rack of pork ribs and half rack of beef. That came up to 6 pork pieces and 3 need, for $31.  They both came with the same sauce but the beef was much juicier. The pork ribs could've used more. If I were to return, would probably just get a full rack of beef instead.  3.5 stars for the beef. 2.5 for the pork."}
{"text":"Nicely organized event. Plenty of people hired to make sure there are clean tables and lots of parking. The lineups were super long at around 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Decided to lineup at Gator BBQ. Even with two lines it took about 45 minutes at least to finally place an order. Opted for the 1lb pulled pork for $12 and make my own pulled pork sandwich at home. Much better value than a $8-9 pulled pork sandwich you buy there. With the 1lb pulled pork I can make about 6 sandwiches. Did that make me sound cheap or what, but I'm Asian so its okay :) (5 stars for the pulled pork, you just can't go wrong with pulled pork)  Also got some Beaver bites with ice-cream which I really don't recommend. Much rather the standard Beaver Tails for about the same price.   Also tried the corn dipped in butter. I thought for $4 it would be the best corn ever but sadly it fell way below expectations. My corn was a bit old and I have definitely had sweeter corn from the local grocery store.   Also tried the blooming onion for $10. Super oily and totally not worth it. Had to throw away half the onion. If I had eaten the whole thing I think I would have lost a couple years off my life. It looks cool but only recommend trying once if sharing with a large group.   Just a note: you will smell like smoked meat by the time you leave."}
{"text":"We went to the Markham Ribfest again this year and was not disappointed. Some of the ribbers had long lines so we decided to go to Brickyard BBQ. My wife decided to share the bellybuster (1/2 rack of ribs, 1/2 chicken, 1/2 lbs pulled pork and 2 sides) all for 30$. It was well cooked, moist and the sauce was delicious with a slight kick to it. We couldn't finish it all. There were also food trucks on location but we were too full to try. The only complain I have is that there isn't much places to sit down. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Visit every year even though is the smallest ribfest so far, aa long as it has Gator bbq is fine and Gator bbq has the best ribs ever, will be back every year"}
{"text":"One of many Ribfests around the GTA.  This one's at the Markham Civic Centre and occurs once a year.  This review will only reflect when I go - that is, early in the morning.  In case you haven't been to one, Ribfest is a bit of a festival in which companies who sell ribs, set up a stand and sell them to you!  It's pretty simple.  There's usually some other stands including ones for lemonade, drinks, corn on the cob and desserts (including beaver tail).  I love starting off with a corn cob before going to ribs.  I usually go with my family so we split up and get someone to buy a set of ribs at each stand.  If memory serves, they're usually around $22 for a full rack of ribs at any given stand (there's no admission fee).  The ribs themselves are always awesome and it's fun to taste some from every stand.  They always have varying degrees of tastiness in the sauce and the meat itself.  Lines tend to be long once lunch time hits so I'd recommend going as early as possible to avoid long lines and if you want a close parking spot (the surrounding business let you use their parking lots, which is really nice).  If memory serves, Kansas City tend to have the best ribs.  I think I've gone to the Rib Fest for four years in a row now and this passed year, they had a smaller turnout.  They used to have 6 or 7 stands but they only had 4 this year.  Hopefully that downward trend doesn't keep going.  That being said, the low turnout could be because of the terrible weather we had so who knows.  The event in general is pretty well run.  I can't speak for the afternoon or night, but the grounds are always pretty clean and there's usually volunteers hovering around the tables asking if you'd like more napkins (which is necessary sometimes).  There's also plenty of tables set up around the area but since I'm never there at the busiest of times, I'm not sure how full it gets.  If the weather calls for rain, be warned that there's only so many tents so you may be stuck taking the ribs home or eating in the rain.  Obviously this event is best enjoyed in the sun!  All in all, I can't really complain about the event.  If you like pork ribs, I'd recommend going, for sure.  Take some friends and/or family too!  In order to avoid long lines, I'd recommend going as early as possible."}
{"text":"There was a good selection of rib stands to choose from, with most boasting of their many 1st place wins at various other Ribfests. This was a Saturday around 8 pm so the wait was around 30 minutes depending on which vendor you chose. I paid $25 for a sampler (ribs, pulled pork, and chicken) from Billy Bones. Pretty good, but I would recommend paying a few dollars extra to get coleslaw and a bun.  The non-rib vendors were not that appealing to me (stinky tofu, tornado potatoes, fresh pineapple punches, etc.) I did try a blooming onion and a lemonade, but in the end I want really feeling them. The live band was good, playing a selection of 70s music I believe. This didn't really match the crowd's composition, however it still sounded great. The midway is more for kids with limited carnival games and mild rides. There's also a $2 entrance forced donation, which in my opinion is not the best way to do it.   Overall I don't think I'd come back, but more for personal reasons. For a food fest I like to sample many small dishes. Here you more or less get one or two orders of ribs and you're done. The non-rib selection is limited, which doesn't matter if you came here only for ribs, but for me was a bit disappointing.   TL; DR: Good if you love ribs, just ok if you don't"}
{"text":"I have live in Markham for years! This is the first time I ever been to their Annual Ribfest!  Parking is plentiful! Free and less than 5 minute walk from the actual event site. Thanks for the surrounding office buildings open up their lots for event parking.  Free admission..extra money for food and drinks?  At the Main BBQ area there are 6 different food vendors smoking and flaming their ribs, chicken, pulled pork... Meat lovers heaven!  There are also Beaver tails, Funnel Cakes, Corns and all the regular festivities food trucks. I am surprised to see even a stinky tofu stall too!  Beers are limited to Mill Street: Organic and Stock Ale.. or maybe you prefer a cooler?  Non stop entertainment at the bandstand while people enjoying their food and a nice July weekend!  Tips: - come early... or in between meals? The lines get long at around 7:30 - Not all BBQ places are the same! Follow the crowd or go and smell the meat or see the open flames... (My friend ended up picked from one of the vendors that gave her cold, dried and chewy ribs!)  Why are my friends eyeing my ribs with hungry looking eyes?!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't see my usual beef rib provider. And there's only a few of us going this year so not much we can select without stuffing ourselves too much.   At the very least the stinky tofu smell isn't too strong so I  happy about that.   The sound is a bit loud but still relatively tolerable.   The funnel cake was vetoed out because they didn't have ice cream when we were about to buy so we ended up with beaver tail.   The beaver tails were done wrong. It's cheap at $7 but still done wrong. The chocolate was just spread across not done in cris cross and there was not enough icing sugar.   We only had one ribber to test because there was only a few of us. Unfortunately Tennessee didn't satisfy us. The ribs were not fall off the bone and not too juicy.   The best thing we had there was the blooming onion. Just make sure you spice it up with oregano, garlic and some Cajun spices since they don't do it for you."}
