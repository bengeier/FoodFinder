{"text":"Happened into this place by chance and I'm so glad I did. Friendly staff, great beer selection and a hotdog with bacon and Mac and cheese on it (\"The Yinzer\")."}
{"text":"Great place!  Excellent beer selection. Great menu. Many items made from scratch.  Haven't eaten anything I didn't enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great beer, great/friendly owners and staff. Menu is being updated and specials are always great.  Dogs, burgers and pizza are always good. Addition of fresh cut fries and some Bloody Mary bar Sundays are additions right up my alley.  Wish specials and draft lists were updated on social media on a more daily basis. Website has been non-existent since new owners took over. Only reason for four stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Yinzer burger (with macaroni & cheese) and chili cheese fries were different and delicious. They appeared to have a better than average beer selection, although It's not my beverage of choice so I can't say too much about that. Not exactly a vegan destination, but if you want hearty food, good service, a relaxed atmosphere and reasonable prices, I'd recommend this joint. Yes, it is a joint ... and I mean that in the best, kindest way possible. Can't wait to go there again, probably after my cholesterol level comes back down."}
{"text":"Nice friendly bar. Food is very good with regular week end specials.  Good beer selection. Only complaint is the draft pour oftentimes have 3-4 inches of head instead of the 1-1.5 inches recommended by beer advocate.  Rather than getting a pint of beer, you often only get 12 ounces. Fix that problem and it is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great beer selection.  Staff is friendly and make this a great place for lunch, dinner, or happy hour.  You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This place is very consistant and very good. I have been here many times and the service has been exceptional and the food has been very good. The weekend specials are always great and I highly recommend them. If you love beer , this place has a fine selection. Always a great time!!!!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of those places that you may drive by and never give a second thought. But my mom and i tried this place based on all the good reviews and were pretty shocked. The restaurant is nothing special- dark, a bit older and run down. We had a hard time picking our meal because there were a lot of choices and it all sounded good. We ended up sharing mac and cheese, a Chicago dog, and their gouda and brisket bbq sandwhich. Mac and cheese was so creamy and homey- definitely something you can order as a meal and be smitten. Chicago dog was good but nothing really amazing in my opinion (my mom did rave about it though). But that brisket sandwhich. It puts everything to shame. So simple- white bread, brisket, melted gouda, and bbq sauce. So perfect. Every bite was delicious. Sauce was spot on, gouda not overbearing, and the brisket, tender and flavorful. One of those menu items that everytime you go there, you have to order that (which is a bit tough since so many other things sounded good). I got the beer battered fries to go with the brisket sandwhich and they were out of this world! Hot, crispy, huge, and a decent amount. The waiter was so nice and all the food was hot and fresh. Best part was all of that totaled less than $25. For all the good food we ate, that price was unbeatable. New go-to restaurant in my book!"}
{"text":"I have never been as pleased with a pizza...SO good and cheesy. The waiter was helpful and provided great service. My husband and I stopped in on a whim but we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dad's is a really great place. We go there once a week and our food is always good but today we spent almost $30 and our food wasn't up to their normal standards. We got home and our burger was the wrong burger, it was  dry, no flavor to it whatsoever.  My husband's wings were dry, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Beer selection is always great.  Now for this weekend's special... \"beer\" mussels. Damn... just perfect, floating in garlicky, buttery broth,  cooked just enough, WOW can I have another PLEASE."}
{"text":"Ordered a beer and the taco special.  I asked for hot sauce on the taco.  When I got the bill I was charged 1 for hot sauce and my food was cold."}
{"text":"Go here for the beer selection for sure, but the affordable food is above average too even if it's just greasy bar food."}
{"text":"Went to Dad's last night while in Pittsburgh area for a youth hockey tournament.  We walked in and told hostess we were expecting a group of 13 with 7 being teenagers, and asked if we could sit at the two available tables that were litearally two feet from each other and was told very rudely \"they do not allow that\".  So they proceeded to put the tables together but in doing so were unable to seat 13.  So they begrudgingly moved the tables back and allowed us to sit.  Food was ok, nothing great, beer was good. Wont be going back tonight, I'm sure many other establishments have good beer."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a mid week lunch. In the mood for a Reuben sandwich. Asked for sauerkraut but was given coleslaw. Ok, not a deal breaker but the barely warm meat and DRY toasted marble bread?!?  Ugh.  Beer batter fries are an additional $2- again not a deal breaker but the portion was skimpy. Really not enough to share.  My lunch date got a grilled chicken and strawberry salad. All yellowish green iceberg lettuce and nothing remotely special about that meal. Add in an iced tea and water the bill with tax was $31 and change. Wow, just wow.  They store extra cans of beer and soda under the dining room seating area. Skeeved me out a bit- I suppose it's ok for sanitary reasons but- eh it seems like a small town hicky maneuver. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this place for food. Possibly beer but there are distributors likely less expensive. I really wanted to like this place"}
{"text":"Great service.  Our server went above and beyond for us.  She was so sweet and checked on us all the time but wasn't too intrusive.  Can't remember her name but she had big blue eyes and dark hair and tattoos.  She smiled the whole time and she had a vast knowledge of the craft beers available.    The food was soooo good.  We had never been here before but we can't wait to go back.  Hope we have the same server!  The owner should be proud to represent his restaurant with such a dynamic employee as her.  Thank you!  Abigail W."}
{"text":"Food wasn't the best and service wasn't amazing either. Quality food could really help business seems like everything was frozen prior to being cooked ( the pizza) I did enjoy the burger and hot dog with the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"If I were from Pittsburgh, I'd definitely be a regular. My boyfriend and I completely enjoyed this place. Definitely gotta get the yinzer dog or any combination of macaroni and cheese dishes."}
{"text":"While passing through western Pennsylvania I found the kind of pub I wish I had in my home town. Friendly, fun, fantastic food, and fabulous beer list  Upon arrival, I checked in with the hostess, and asked for  patio seating so I could keep my eyes on my dog who was waiting in my car (with plenty of water and the windows open).  She  informed me that they were dog friendly and he could sit with me on the patio. By the time I got back to my seat with my dog in tow, my beer was waiting and a bowl of water was waiting for my pooch.   The menu was tavern/pub fare  but not typical.  I had the Dog Fish beer batter cod fish bites for starters. Made with plenty of large chunk of cod coated with a very crispy and flavorful beer batter coating and my choice of tarter or cocktail sauce.  I followed the fish bites with a brat and kraut on a pretzel bun with Dad's homemade beer cheese. Very tasty!   The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. They made me and my dog feel very welcome and comfortable. I'm only sorry I live 6 hrs away or I'd certainly be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Great place for fun food and great craft brews!!! Excellent service too!!! Reasonable prices. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place has a great tap list and it's always changing. I'm currently here for Pittsburgh craft beer week and they have a full list of Souther Tier beers for a tap takeover. I always get the fried pretzels with honey mustard because theirs is some of the best. Their pizza is great, but today I had the yinzer quesadilla and it is AMAZING!! So many fun things on the list and cool temporary things like Not Your Fathers BBQ wings! The patio is fun and it's a great little spot. So glad it's right in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A very good bar with lots of beers on tap. I have been there couple of times. First time was on a Sunday night and it was fairly empty. It looked and smelled old, so I thought it was not doing too well. I failed to see all the beers on tap behind the bartender. Second time around was another weekday and it was very busy. They have a very nice collection of beers which, apparently they change often. My friend thought they served best loaded nachos ever but that might have to do with him being hungry. Food is not bad, but mostly bar food. Their burgers, wings, etc. are good too. Have not had any outstanding dish yet, but will write about it if I find one."}
{"text":"Great first experience. Yelp rating was spot on. Loved the Nacho's and battered fries!  The Hotdog with a couple of beers made it complete.   Oh, awesome service and will go there again, and again and again!"}
{"text":"Great place for our family of 5 on a stop off point on way to DC.  Lots of tvs and better than any chain we could have gone to.  Staff was exceptionally friendly.  Food was good and plenty of options for all ages.  Beer selection is terrific, will go back if ever close by."}
{"text":"Delicious large portions. I had a Ruben Sandwich  which was massive; my friend  had wings and fries. They were perfectly  cooked, very large and equally delectable."}
{"text":"I'm giving Dad's four stars because it's great for what it is - a dive with good bar food and friendly service. You don't go here for a healthy or fancy meal, but if you want tasty greasy bar food, it's pretty great. We got wings and the cheesy bacon fries which were both very good and satisfied our hungover cravings. We also got the fried zucchini but I wouldn't get it again. The horseradish sauce was good but there was hardly any zucchini under the fried breadcrumbs which was a little disappointing. However, the bartender was super friendly and attentive and knew all about the craft beers on tap which we appreciated. My boyfriend got the xmas ale she recommended and he loved it. Overall, I'd go back on a casual day when calories don't count, but set your expectations right!"}
{"text":"They have \"to go\" six packs and it is on my way home.  I no longer have to go to Giant Eagle to get beer."}
{"text":"We stopped here on an overnight during a recent road trip. We greatly appreciated the fact they they were dog friendly and allowed them on the patio. There was a great beer selection and tried many new beers. Even the local selection was numerous. The deep fried cheese was decadent. The cheese steak was fantastic. Even the chicken Caesar salad was solid."}
{"text":"While staying in Monroeville for the US Open we wanted to grab some solid grub and we used Yelp to find places in the area.  The service and food were really fantastic.  We had wings and pizza - not exactly a healthy endeavor, but the food met expectations and the beer selection was pretty solid as well.  We will gladly hit Dad's again the next time we're in the region."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!! I've had the gyro, Yinzer hotdog, chili dogs, and keg root beer in two trips here.  All was vey good.  It was a little busy when we were here but our food came out very fast.  Fries were really good too.  I am not a drinker but they had a huge selection of beer."}
{"text":"Awesome 5-star beer selection, amazing homemade gastro-pub food, and great service. The burgers were super fresh and well seasoned, onion rings are perfect and prices are reasonable. Lots of TVs. Kid friendly and would be regulars if we lived here!"}
{"text":"You can get a cheeseburger anywhere but people come to Dads for the attitude and the atmosphere. The bartender Michelle is awesome and very hospitable. There are a ton of beer options and full bar as well."}
{"text":"Two friends and I went here for the first time tonight. We are already trying to figure out when we'll be nearby again! Everything was exceptionally good. We had three different dogs, three different kinds of fries and the quality and quantity was just great. Not that you could really go wrong with a Bacon and mac n cheese-topped hot dog but the reason we were all so impressed wad the quality of the food. The dog, bun, bacon and even the pasta was basically way better than it probably needed to be. But...it's definitely why I'm taking the time to do this. Well done!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Great hotdogs. I like the atmosphere and the many beers on tap.  The menu is not huge, but everything tastes great!  Big fat tasty burgers as well."}
{"text":"Unassuming place, housed in what appears to be a former Pizza Hut. It's a lot of typical pub grub, but all was very good. I found it a bit loud inside, so we asked to be seated on the patio. Everyone enjoyed their food. Would definitely go back if in the area."}
{"text":"In the suburban world of chain restauants this place stands out.  We were looking for a local place that served kid friendly food.  I wasn't sure if this place would foot the bill.  I walked in cautiously thinking that 4 adults and 4 kids under 4 would be groaned at.  Not at all, as we sat by two other tables with wee ones.  I did notice that as it got closer to 7 the clientele didn't look as enthused to see kid heaven.  But our waitress was awesome as was the rest of the staff.  They sat us where we could keep the two hyper 3 year olds fenced in with the bench seats.  My next happy moment was seeing the Thursday night special of $3.50 for Great Lakes Drafts.  Now, I have been cutting carbs out of most of my meals the last month so this was possibly the best beer I have ever had.  Or  it was the month long absence from beer.  I had two and made sure my wife drove back to the hotel (I am a cautious and sensible person).    The food was also excellent.  We ordered kids mac n cheese which was pretty good with fries.  I ordered the Chili hot dog with sweet potato fries.  I loved my meal but again I have barely ate carbs lately so this made this meal all the better.  I wish the sweet potato came with a sauce of some kind but they were still pretty good without sauce.  The hot dogs are decent size and juicy.  Our whole group was quite pleased with the meal as we could order good food for under $10.  I was completely full  and couldn't even force myself to go get ice cream.  This is a gem in the middle of suburban chains.  Great service, good food, and a great beer selection.  They are also kid friendly."}

{"text":"I've recently taken a liking to this UTBAPH (used to be a Pizza Hut) and local dive bar. I used to stop by for a six pack of craft beers and it took a while before I convinced myself to try the food. We are now in the mode of \" have to try something different on the menu every time\", because we are finding so many of the items are good. I can recommend the Fish Bites on the appetizer section, the Gyro was very good. My companion liked the hot sausage sandwich. These things we would get again. My most recent trip I decided to get the fish sandwich. It was good but I may not put it on my favorites list here. There are several things I want to try before having that again, but having said that, if I had a craving for a fish sandwich, I would go back and get the fish bites. I usually get the Sierra Nevada Celebration IPA on draft, but the beer selection is so varied, I think anyone would be pleased."}
{"text":"Hey it's just a bar , but it offers above average tavern food, a great draft beer selection and has very friendly bartenders. Hmmmm, maybe it's not \"just\" a bar.  Ask for a k-boss. Trust me."}
{"text":"A nice laid back dive bar to grab quick bites and a beer. They have nice selection on draft and also have many bottles and variety of beer. The food has good proportions and the staff is really helpful in helping you choose what and how much to order. I went there with a couple of coworkers and we had a great time."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Burgers, beer, pizza, gyros, and much more.. crowded, but worth the 15 minute wait. Just stop by.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Long time customer. Always an excellent beer list with good prices. Often times good week end specials. Hope they add some more healthy choices though.  Good to hear they are opening a second place.  Hope the owners can now give up bar tending and taking tips. Not real comfortable with tipping the owner, especially when the manager of the new location is not one of the owners!"}
{"text":"Nice menu, food tasty, and good service but the bathroom was prehistoric and icky! Reasonable prices and I sat outside overlooking the parking lot. Inside would have been a depressing 1980's Pizza Hut memory..."}
{"text":"One of the most delicious restaurants in Monroeville. Huge varied menu, super friendly staff and the take out is quick and wonderful"}
{"text":"Searched Yelp for an alternative to the chain restaurants and found Dad's. Just as everyone described, it's pub food with a good craft beer selection. Totally meets my expectations. Started with a local IPA on draft and the Greuben sandwich (it's a Reuben they prepare several ways - your choice). I had the traditional corned beef. The marbled rye was fresh baked delicious, the corned beef was lean and the sauerkraut topped it off. Service was pleasant and prompt. Great local alternative!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beers and food!  Very friendly servers and bartenders.  Bloody Mary bar is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!!! I can't put into words how good the food is!!!! My first item was the yinzer egg rolls....man first of all they came out picture perfect on a bed of green shredded lettuce and a side of Mac and cheese sauce...now this isn't your typical side of cheese, no this cheese sauce had the Mac and cheese flavor that you grew up with as a child and it was the dipping sauce for the egg rolls...they were filled with beef, mac and cheese noodles and bacon all ready to be drenched in the cheese sauce and man it was good...it was creamy and all around savory and filling! My girlfriend got an order of homemade cheese sticks that were cheesy, flavorful and seasoned perfectly! They were not your typical cheese sticks that every bar food and restaurant carries these were a unique concoction that were hand made and deep fried to perfection....on to the main course I got the yinzer burger basically like the egg rolls but on a burger to save time it tasted amazing and just as good as the egg rolls but the bun ohhhhh the bun it was a homemade roll that did not disintegrate with all the toppings on it...no it was a well crafted and work of art that held that beast together...the burger patty was flavorful and seasoned perfectly...the other main course was a brisket melt which to put it clearly brisket grilled cheese which was drizzled in Golden bbq sauce which again homemade and flavorful....the brisket was piled thick and it was juicy not dried out like most restaurants and it was yummy the bread was again homemade and it was huge which blew my mind how good it was...we will definitely be back and we can't say anything negative about this hidden gem it is truly worthy of all five of its stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish i lived closer to this place! Everything was delicious. The chicken caesar was fresh, the zucchini planks were crisp, the mac and cheese was really good. Sarah my waitress was patient and efficient. Thank you for a good experience! i will come back when im in the area."}
{"text":"This place has it together. Delicious food, positive and knowledgeable bar tenders. The food comes out fast , cooked to order, hot and fresh. Its nothing much from the looks but it's a great spot."}
{"text":"We did not have a good overall experience this evening.   Their pop machine was down and they were serving pop out of cans.  My drink had almost no carbonation and tasted old.  We got the pub fries and zucchini as apps, I will say that they were good.  The tiger (horseradish) dressing was perfect for the zucchini.  For a meal, I ordered a burger done medium.  When it arrived, it looked like they just seared the outside of the patty.  It was red and pink inside, almost raw looking.  Far from medium.  When I pointed it out to the server, she said that the only way you get no pink is well done, and even then you get some.  What's the point of that?  I order my steak medium rare but don't always trust burgers done that way, so medium will do.  Apparently their definition of medium is different from every other restaurant I've ever been to.   She was not very attentive, was slow on the refills, and forgot two of our drinks on the only round she refilled.   It took some 20 mins to get the bill, have her take it, and bring it back.  All while our dirty dishes sat on the table in front of us. Will not be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"AMAZING craft beer selection, both in terms of drafts and bottles. I always have a hard time picking what I want, since there are so many tempting options! Food isn't fancy (mostly pizza,  wings, sandwiches) but is very good quality (e.g. mozarella sticks seem to be fresh cheese breaded in-house rather than some premade frozen sticks). My favorite is their BBQ pizza!"}
{"text":"I love Dad's! The staff is super friendly, the food is always good, and a super bonus is they have outdoor seating where your pups can accompany you!."}
{"text":"Great food, great brews. Nice place to chill with friends or just have a beer on your on. Pizza and wings are great,  but try the dogs and hot Italian sausage."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for Bar food and in monroeville overall.  Our friends were telling us about this place and when Mad Mex had a 90 mins wait we decided to check it out.  Upon entry you can tell it is in an old Pizza Hut but the building shape, but don't let looks fool you.  The food is great and the beer selection even better.  Get the provolone sticks, fresh cut Provolone and hand battered to order.  The Gruben (lamb or corned beef) (slaw or kraut) is delicious; one of my top 3 rubens In the burg.  The hot beef sandwich is made with roasted meat in house and the tiger sauce they serve it with has the perfect bite.  For the vegetarians got the portobello mushroom wrap, easily one of the best wraps I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is so delicious! I usually get the pizza roll and my boyfriend gets a few of their burgers and we love it every time! Amazing atmosphere as well. Only downside is it a bit pricey as college students."}
{"text":"This is a solid basic drinking bar with a great selection of beers.  I tried the hot dog and in 30 seconds it was gone. Good selection of toppings (think Chicago-style) on a poppy seed bun. Friendly wait staff, good TVs, not pretentious. Will definitely re-visit the next time I come back through town."}
{"text":"Its a converted Pizza Hut - and a bit of a hunt to find, but worth the effort, especially if you are in a beer hunt.  They have so many different types of bottle/can beers that they have beer fridges all over the restaurant, including storing cases under your bench seats.  Wait staff is friendly and willing to help you on your beer selection.  The menu is large - lots of burgers and sandwiches - and create your own pizza.    In the summer they have an outside section - which should be nice.  Worth dropping in."}
{"text":"Yes.  This place is a mantopia (but great for women too!).  The building has resilience (and a bit of an identity crisis) which only adds to some of the charm.  What was originally obviously a Pizza Hut, then a D's Six Pack n' Dogz, and now Dad's, represents a great low key joint to grab some good food and partake in a few frothy beverages.  The extensive draft and menu choices pay homage to this place's previous life (D's), and that's a good thing.  Took all six of my groomsmen here the morning of my wedding as a pre-ceremony decompress, and it was exactly what the doctor ordered versus the standard Monroeville chain joints.  The appetizers were good (particularly the pepperjack cheese bites) and the burgers w/ fries, chips, or sweet potato fries all were great.  Service could of been a little more attentive, but overall, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"wow. small hometown pub and definately NOT a dive bar. a lot if folks laughing and having a goid time even after 11pm.  This is my first visit and I'm only in town for the weekend but I KNOW where I'll be tomorrow.... right here at the bar.  Food looks great and I'll try some tomorrow for sure. Great service and an incredible selection of craft beers. Great atmosphere and people."}
{"text":"Exactly as advertised. Food and service good. Easy to get in and out."}
{"text":"Brace yourself, this place is MENU OVERLOAD. They have, by far, the largest selection of beers east of the city I've ever seen. They have IPAs out the wazoo, craft beers, your basic miller lites, yuenglings, whatever you want, these guys have. The bar tender always gives great recommendations (I've always had the same guy), if you tell him what beers you're into, he always hits the nail on the head.  They have a create-your-own hot dog shop.  Multiple mac n cheese dishes.  Homemade chili.  Smoked Gouda brisket grilled cheese sandwich. Yes, you heard me. A Gouda grilled cheese sandwich topped with delicious, delicious brisket with a drizzle of golden BBQ sauce. The most delectable thing that's ever been tasted.   I'm pretty sure just about everything on this menu will clog your arteries, but your taste buds will be happy doing it. (UPDATE: They do carry salads. I think I was too pre-occupied looking at everything else to notice, but I wanted to be fair.)"}
{"text":"I had a chance to sneak off and enjoy a Saturday afternoon of great beer and no kids.  Dad's Pub and Grub offers just that. I was enjoying a Stone IPA and I decided to grab some lunch. I do want to point out the staff is great here and I usually go alone and every time I am here I end up talking with really nice people at the bar.  Though I'm sure me boozing a being a chatty one doesn't hurt. ;) What can I say I like fellow drinkers!  I went with the Beef and Cheddar burger as my choice. I thought the burger was little too done for me but I ate it all. So, I guess it wasn't so bad. They do allow you to add all the toppings you want and the fries and pickle were a ok addition. As a heads up this place is known for hotdogs but I passed on this visit."}
{"text":"Gastropub? Umm, no. Sports bar? Eh, not in the traditional sense. Local watering hole that serves very good food, has an amazing beer selection and enough televisions to watch any of the local black and gold teams? Yes!  I needed somewhere to stop halfway between OH and MD and Monroeville seemed just right, especially to watch the Steelers game so close to the city. But I had no idea where to go until Yelp saved me again with Dad's Pub & Grub.   There's nothing fancy about it, but please refer to what I said above: an unexpected but amazing list of Winter lagers on draft and a menu of wings, dogs and burgers that had me scratching my head. This dilemma was compounded when I saw the couple's order next to me, which included the Yinzer Dog covered with two strips of bacon, homemade mac & cheese and cheese sauce. Uh yeah, a definite heavenly WTH moment for my enormous appetite. But did I succumb and order it? No, because apparently I'm an idiot.  Well, actually I got something very similar instead: the Yinzer Burger, topped with the exact same stuff. And yes, it was as frickin' awesome as it read and looked! I'd definitely get it or that monster dog again in a second. Oh, and it apparently came with fries too, but with the tasty burger and awesome brews keeping my divided attention, I don't even remember them. I'll just say they were good too.  4.5 Stars."}
{"text":"After trying to decide for 20 minutes where to eat, we decided to try dad's. We checked yelp, and finding it received good reviews, decided to try it out.   We did not wait long for a table, even though almost every table was taken. The opposite side of the restaurant was a bar, and I like how they separated both ides of the restaurant with two garage doors. Our waitress, Sarah, was outstanding. She was very knowledgable and helpful about all items on the menu.   We ordered the provolone sticks for an appetizer, which were hand breaded and fried to perfection. There was the perfect amount of cheese-to-breading ratio and the marinara sauce was seasoned great.   I ordered the portobello mushroom wrap and beer battered fries. Amazing. My fiancé ordered the bacon cheddar burger and added egg. It was char-grilled and juicy. The burger bread was nothing spectacular, but nonetheless, a VERY good burger.   His 2 Oktoberfest beers were only 3.50 each. We walked out with a $40 bill for everything! Great first experience and I must say the fries are all they're talked up to be. Will probably be our new go-to spot in Monroeville."}
{"text":"It's a cold and snowy day after Valentine's day night and the hub and I are wondering what shall we do for dinner.  Lobster was on the mind, but that means I would have to go to the Eagle, buy it, bring it back, then cook the insects and it was already going on 8pm.  Ugh what to do?  Oh let's go out and try somewhere local.  Not that I have never been to Dad's I have just never eaten there.  So a not so short car ride to Monroeville, (we got stuck in the driveway for a good 20 minutes) we pulled in.  So we pulled in at about a quarter to 9, and the parking lot was packed.  Entering the brick restaurant that I am told used to be a Pizza Hut, we were met by the hostess who offered us a table or if we wanted to take our chances in the bar then take a look.  I personally like to sit at bars if I am with only one other person.  It seems like you get much more prompt service when you are within feet of someone waiting on you the entire time.  Well we somehow lucked out and there were two empty stools right in the middle.  It worked out well, especially since the place was packed, and really loud.       Starting with the drinks, I sampled the Troegs nugget nectar and I found it wonderfully to my liking.  The hub decided to take it easy and just went with a domestic draft and later switched to water which the bartender complimented that he was so sweet.... I think that was very funny. After a couple of the Troegs I went to the Fat Heads IPA.  It was outstanding so we were off to an excellent start.  At ordering time I decided to go with a bowl of chili, and a create your own dog.  The dog prices were a bit high.  3.25-4.75 for one regular size hot dog?  Well besides the price the taste was great.  It was on a poppy seed bun and was an all-beef dog.  Now for my toppings, let's just say I added everything but ketchup and mayo.  I can't stand ketchup on my hot dogs... But everything else made the plain dog stand right out and it was very, very good!   The chili though I ate that first, I think I liked it more than the dog, not  just because the price was more on the mark, but it was really tasty.   It has to be one of the thickest chili's I have ever had.   I would love to try this chili on something because it can hold its own and not make a huge sloppy mess (Ideas pop into head, burger, nachos oh the list could go on).  It was spicy, but not too spicy at all, and I would have been fine with it if they made it even spicier.  Because of the texture and the way this chili held itself together, I joked with the H about how it reminded me of sloppy Joe's consistency.  He laughed commenting that he believed the Sloppy J's were looser than the chili.  It was really enjoyable.    The Hub had the Dad's BBQ Chicken Pizza.  He ate it all, but commented that the crust wasn't that great.  He loved the toppings, but thought the crust lacked flavor, soooo glad I didn't order a pizza!  Flavor was no problem for me during this cool dining experience.  I will be needing more chili here soon..."}
{"text":"Always fantastic! Dog fish bites are a must. Any hot dog rocks. The panko fish is great, too, and never a miss with pizza or wings. And I haven't even mentioned the fantastic staff. You will never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If your trying to stick to a healthy New Years resolution this is not the place to go.  I clearly went off the healthy track and got the chicken bacon ranch wrap with fries.  It was absolutely delicious and you all must get the fresh cut fries.  Seriously sooo good.  If your looks for some good old bar type food this is definitely the place to go.  I would totally enjoy this place to watch a sports game, have some beers and just not calorie count.  This probably won't be a stop in my recent future due to my own food choices but I will definitely be back at some point and already told my dad he will love this place."}
{"text":"This place is truly great - because it knows exactly what it is.  It's a true pub that offers a wide variety of beers with simple, yet delicious pub fare...all at a great price!  Plain and simple...I'm an instant fan and will return.  Not to mention, this place has plenty of TVs if you ever need to catch a sporting event.  Friendly staff, great service, great beer, great food....the recipe for four stars.  No need to say anything else - Dad's is a winner!"}
{"text":"I had the Chicago hotdog and it was by far one of the best sites I have ever had.  We also got the chili cheese fries, the chili was fabulous.  It was a Friday during happy hour and they are extremely busy.  We still had fast service.  This is one one of my new favorite places.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"In town for business, staying close by. Quick Yelp search turned me onto this place - it did not disappoint, at all! Great selection of craft beers - the Great Divide Fresh Hop APA was seriously top notch. Ordered the \"Grueben\" with corned beef and sauerkraut on marble rye... DAMN GOOD! I'd come back here in a hot minute."}
{"text":"This place was ok I guess. Kinda dead in there and low energy but good food and tons of beer choices. Was just staying in town one night so for a quick bite and some beers i say ok."}
{"text":"Great local place!  Service was great.  Fireballs were good.  Yinzer Burger with Mac and cheese was incredible.  Smoked Gouda Brisket was good as well."}
{"text":"I loved my Yinzer burger; it was cooked the way I like it and it was juicy and delicious. Decent beer selection, and I appreciated the variety on the TVs."}
{"text":"Stopped based on great ratings and the location as were passing through Pittsburgh. What a gem. All four of us were very happy with our food. The quesadilla with mac and cheese was fabulous, as well as the pub burger and chili. My girlfriend had the buffalo chicken salad and I had the wedding soup and a salad. Both excellent. We all said we would stop here again. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Really good. Everything seems to be made in-house. The waiter was very cool. Laid back atmosphere, it was like a comfortable dive bar. Garage doors come down to separate the bar and dining area when it gets around beer o'clock I'm guessing. I had the brisket grilled cheese which was good. BUT THE MAC AND CHEESE THOUGH! on point. The buffalo mac is practically perfect. Everything I had I would order again. I'm posting pics of all this BTW"}
{"text":"The beer selection, food and staff is amazing! This is one of my favorite hang outs.. I HIGHLY recommend Dad's Pub!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for seven years now and this by far is my favorite bar in Monroeville. If you are a craft brew fan like myself you will be in heaven. They continuously rotate the newest seasonal beers and put them on draft.    As far as the food is concerned, it is out of this world. It is so much better than bar food. They have specialty hot dogs, great pizza, delicious burgers, and unique wraps.   The bartenders and workers are really friendly and they have been a friend to me and my coworkers over the past several years and we keep coming back for that very reason. They have been the host to many of our seasonal parties and functions.  If you skip this place, you will be surely missing out."}
{"text":"I really wish that yelp had half stars to give. This place is at a minimum a 4.5, maybe even higher, but not quite a 5. A converted pizza hut gone right. They have a incredible beer selection wit something around 30+ beers on tap along with a mammoth of a cooler full of beer. The food is good, some better than others and thats why this is driving the review from a solid 5 to a 4.5. As someone who truly enjoys just good food in general, I am hard to miss, and very easy to please when it comes to food. The buffalo chicken pizza I had was great, and the lamb burger I had was just ok. They have some awesome specials it seems (geared towards alcohol most times) and really seems like it would be a great Local bar to be at. Living in Johnstown I just don't get to visit that often, but it isnt too far off the beaten bath that I wouldn't come back again. The service is so-so, nothing fantastic and nothing terrible so not much to say here. Other than that it is definitely worth your time to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great little bar with beers aplenty and GOOD FOOD- chili cheese fries are fantastic. The \"Yinzer Dog\" (mac&cheese and bacon) is my favorite. Kind of small, and gets pretty busy I would definitely recommend using the NoWait app beforehand."}
{"text":"Great veggie options (veggie dogs and burgers) Great beer selection at a reasonable price with a great happy hour."}
{"text":"This local dive bar won my heart.  Sat at bar and was totally taken care of.  Yinzer dog.  Out of this world awesomeness.  I have got to go back for a Yincer burg.  Chili cheese fries.  The fries are beer batter dipped, tons of creamy cheese.  I rank this dish of comfort food as one of the best I have ever had.     Great craft beer selection on draft!  I love the local atmosphere where the bartender knew most people by their first name!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited the Pittsburgh area from out of town. After fighting the initial urge to turn around, this old Pizza Hut turned gastropub was pleasantly surprising. My daughter and I split a cup of chili and the Yinzer quesadilla. Both were really great! The quesadilla was the size of a stuffed pizza and absolutely delicious. The chili was a no nonsense chili that was obviously homemade and packed with meat. The inside was pretty unique and halfway through my meal they separated the dining room from the bar area with garage doors! I highly recommend giving this old Pizza Hut a chance!"}
{"text":"Not sure this place can get much better. It is awesome, unique, and definitely Pittsburgh. The quesadilla was incredible. The hot dogs were tasty. The beer choice was excellent. I will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here after competing in the Kumite Classic amateur strongman contest in May of this year. There were roughly 15 of us so I made sure to call ahead and speak to a manager a week ahead of time. There was absolutely no issue with them accommodating us!! They reserved a section of the patio for us. Now for the most important part of the review....the food.  The quality of food and service was outstanding!! I had burger that was amazing and my wife had a chicken salad. Everyone had something different and everything was great!! I would highly recommend you check this place out. I know I'll be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Hello Sunday Brunch!   We met some friends here for brunch on Sunday.  I am so glad they recommended it because they do a great job with brunch.  (I guess they only do brunch once a month and you have to like them on facebook to get the date. )  Boy oh boy, do they go all out!?!!  They have a Bloody Mary bar for 6$.  They do their own in house infused Vodkas.  I tried the jalepeno and I tried the black pepper.  They also have a garlic and a bacon.  They have an amazing set up with tomato juice, hot sauces, peppers, stuffed olives, pickles, jerky, bacon, horseradish, and a bunch of other fixins.  The juice is V8, which I prefer.  The fresh made juice has too much pulp for me.   Dad's also has a mimosa bar with fresh berries and juices.   The breakfast is yummy.  They have an omelette station.  You pick the veggies, meats and cheese you want, then they make them fresh for you.    They have a buffet with bacon, sausage, french toast, fruit, turkey and the best hash brown potatoes.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Terrific place. Staying at Comfort Inn close by. Had one of the best burgers in a long, long time: 'Shrooms & Swiss Burger. The waitress recommended a great brown ale: Dogfish Head Indian Brown. Very relaxed atmosphere and good food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love dads Mac and cheese better than my own, it is smothered in creamy cheese!!! Highly recommend it, their yinzer dog is fantastic, it's a hot dog wrapped in bacon covered with Mac and cheese...delish!!! Pub fries awesome! Chips yummy as well!  Love the steak quesadilla too!"}
{"text":"Shocked this little slice of heaven nestled away. Great atmosphere good food average prices. I will come back very soon! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for lunch en route to Philly from Michigan. Not only did we have a great meal and excellent service, but our daughter left her wallet by accident... I called and spoke to the manager and they offered to overnight it to us and refused my offer of payment! Absolutely unexpected and exceptional business service. We will definitely come back on our next east coast adventure! Awesome beer selection, too :)"}
{"text":"I love hot dogs  and wings and it is surprisingly difficult to find good ones of either in the Pittsburgh area.   Dad's excels in both those areas. It is a great little place that can please just about anyone.  It is kid friendly enough that you could bring the little ones (although I would do it earlier in the day) but it is also a great place  you could meet some friends and watch a game.  There are huge TVs all over the restaurant.  There are booths along the walls, regular tables and chairs and also a large bar area.  They have a nice covered patio as well. The menu has simple things like hot dogs, burgers, wings and other typical bar food.  But it is a step above \"bar food\"  Everything I've had is tasty and enjoyable.  My favorite is the customizable hot dogs.  I like one with chili, mustard, onions and pickles but the combinations are virtually endless.   It is interesting to note that their wings come like regular chicken wings or also whole wings.  Make sure you know which option you are ordering. The fresh cut fries are crisp and delicious.  And their \"award winning chili\" is amazing.    Filled with flavor with just the right amount of spice. Most of their menu is available to take out as well. An added bonus is the large selection of beers which are also available as six packs to go. I love Dads and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Best bacon cheese fries in town!  Crisp beer battered fries doused in cheese and topped off with delicious chewy bacon. Their other food is great, amazing comfort food. This is my go to spot after a long day at work."}
{"text":"Best place in Monroeville!  The staff are the nicest and most fun people you'll ever meet.  Delicious food (gouda brisket sandwich!).  Great beer selection.  Fun atmosphere.  Couldn't ask for a better place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and beer selection. Staff is very friendly. The food was delicious, great gastropub food. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago for a work get-together. Mostly everything we got was a fried something or other appetizer. Everything was really good. I would love to come back and try an entree.  The service was exceptional. They have a huge selection of drinks. The building was originally a Pizza Hut and you can definitely see some remnants of the signature Pizza Hut interior. But after a while you barely notice it because there are so many other decorations, sports memorabilia and such. There isn't a separate room for dining, but during the busy times it looks like they pull down a door in the middle of the place that partitions off the bar."}
{"text":"A friend and I had a pleasant experience at Dad's.  The restaurant is clean and it has a friendly atmosphere.  I had the best grilled cheese ever.  I thought I ordered a chicken sandwich, and the sweet manager came over, sat down beside me, and said \"show me what you ordered.\"  I had misread it.  We had a good time, and I think you'll enjoy stopping for a tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"We came across this small pub when at the US Open. The most important item on the menu are the beer battered fries!!!  They are absolutely out of bounds!!  The Mac and cheese is also something you should look at. I had the Italian hoagie which was really good. My hubby had the bacon cheeseburger and said it was good. Great food indoor and outdoor seating available. Lots of craft beer choices. Trust me.....get the beer battered fries!!"}
{"text":"My wife and i ate there while staying in town. The service is excellent and the food is very good... This place was right down the road from our hotel so we didn't have to face the traffic...."}
{"text":"Got dragged out to the monroeville area to pursue a table on Craigslist- looking for a place to eat due to starvation we find Dad's...   Inside is dark and clean, includes a little bar and some tables. Waiters were quick and helpful. The menu involved mostly hot dogs, pizzas, sandwiches, and burgers- it recommends the famous ones.   We decide to grab burgers, my friend got the mushroom and Swiss- I got the big e ( a spicy burger) with sweet potato fries. This a was a solid burger, tender juicy and spicy- I loved it. The regular fries were t crunchy but he sweet potato fries were perfect.   The waitress forgot my appetizer but, by the time I noticed we were full- so it turned out okay.   If I'm ever here again, I wouldn't mind stopping in.   Overall tasty food"}
{"text":"I was in for lunch on Tuesday. The dogfish bites are great.  My burger was cooked perfectly and my fries were crispy, hot and we'll seasoned.. The beer list is great, so was the service. They do it right...."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Stopped here while visiting the area and the food was delicious, atmosphere was great, customer service was top notch!   Good job Dad!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop for a quick bite and a beer. Pretty decent beer selection especially by the bottle. I like the rotating drafts and some specialties that you can't find a around. The food is decent. Nothing to write home about. I do enjoy the fresh cut potato chips. The wraps are pretty good. Pizzas not bad.overall good place to eat. Always a safe bet."}
{"text":"Decent grub, but not good enough to get me back. The bathrooms are disgusting. If you're like me you want to wash your hands before eating.  however their bathroom is vomit inducing."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good! We chose to try Dad's because it's ranked pretty high on places to eat in Monroeville, and rightfully so. I wasnt sure what to expect when we pulled into the parking lot, but the atmosphere was actually cool, and although small, it was comfortable. There were all kinds of different people eating there, from families to large groups. The food was typical pub style, but it was really good. Better than Rivertown or Sharp Edge, I thought. The service leaves a little to be desired  (not bad service, just kind of an in-and-out approach), but we'll definitely be back.   One thing we noticed and liked was that the manager (I think?) was really hands on and involved in the business.. checking on tables, helping with service, etc. Brownie Points, we love to see engaged leadership!"}
{"text":"Everything that I've tried here is amazing! I mean, they make their own ranch.... And it's amazing! I love the Pittsburgh themed items on the menu, will make you laugh!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it!!  Had the chips & the mozzarella sticks, both great!  Tried the brisket grilled cheese, very yummy! Had the beer bartered fries & they were good too! I don't think this was brisket though, tasted & had the texture of thin cut steak.  Everyone enjoyed their meals & we had some craft beer!! Lots of options!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Fast, friendly service. All Pittsburgh pizza places should take a lesson from whoever makes the pizza at dads because it is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here on a Friday after work.  I was early and sat at the bar and enjoyed an IPA that I've never had, Yellow Bridge, and was quite pleased.  Behind the bar, in the same area, they have a bunch of high top tables.  This area was pretty full with groups and became extremely loud.  I was happy to vacate to the other side of the dining area where it was at least 50% more quiet.  For dinner I had a burger with cheddar and bacon and a salad for my side.  The burger was cooked to my specifications and was quite tasty.  A friend had a side order of the chili and wasn't very impressed and just had a few bites.  But really, who orders chili in mid-August?    Service was attentive and quick.  There are many options for beer and  you can also mix and match to take some home with you.    On my way out I stopped to use the rest room and it was a terrible mess.  That kind of dampened my view on Dad's as a dirty restroom can be a deal breaker."}
{"text":"I used to love Dad's and had been going there for years, even back when it was D's, but recently things have been off. Not sure if they're understaffed or there was a change in management but I haven't been impressed with the service in recent visits. Also, they seem to always run out of their food specials which is disappointing. I also feel like the beer list isn't what it used to be (not enough diversity in the options and it doesn't seem to rotate as often).  Good chill place for food and a draft but Dad's needs to pull itself back together. It's definitely changed for the worse over the last year."}
{"text":"This restaurant has alot for just about everyone. The menu is broad, the food is good and the staff is knowledgeable about the food and the large selection of beers on tap. It has tons of regulars because of these fine aspects."}
{"text":"Sadly very disappointed for my first time here when I had heard nothing but great things.   When arriving, the hostess appeared to ignore my presence for several minutes, although the place was busy and she was a server also. After being seated and ordering a cup of the chili and the big e burger, I waited about 20 minutes until my burger came out. I politely inquired about the chili and received the response that it wasn't on my order.   I was not checked up upon after and had to swipe some ketchup and silverware from an empty table. When I was done with the burger, I was still hungry as I had not gotten my chili and was going to inquire about dessert. Instead, the waitress came over and set down my check without saying a word.   The food itself was extremely good though. Burger was cooked to medium rare perfectly and the sauce was great. I'd like to come back again and hopefully have a different experience."}
{"text":"I love dads!! The food is your typical pub fare, but extremely tasty. It's the kind of food you feel guilty about eating, but don't regret it because it was delicious. Great beer selection as well. Service is always decent, and I usually use the no wait app to get seated quickly. My own gripe is that I don't love the atmosphere, but I'm willing to overlook that and award five stars for the food and beer."}
{"text":"Vom  *this review may not accurately reflect the typical visit to Dads Pub & Grub.  It was late on snowy Saturday night..."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday evening and most of the tables were filled up. We were still seated promptly, though we waited a good bit until we saw our waitress.  We tried the famous chili, the fish sandwich, the gyro, and a side of chili cheese fries. The good was solid pub food, but nothing over the top that blew me away. The decor left something to be desired and it's God awfully dark inside.   The service is probably the only thing that wouldn't this a top tier choice next time I splurge and go out. It was slow and highly disorganized, but it was my first time there and all places have off nights. Seems like a great place to catch a sports game or to get a 6pack of beer to go, though."}
{"text":"Nice warm day demanded a dinner on a patio.  Driving by this place and decided to change our original plans and stop in, as they are so close to our home.  Patio dining was just right.  Pub fare, as advertised in the name of the restaurant.  Selections include pizza, wings, salads, sandwiches, soup.  I ordered the gyro and chips and my husband ordered the fish sandwich and fries.  I was satisfied with my gyro but a bite of the fish sandwich makes me want that next time.  Loved the fries snitched from my husband's plate over the chips.  Didn't go inside so can't comment there but we were pleased with food and service outdoors."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and the best hamburgers!  If you like craft beers then this is the place to visit.  And I remember when this location was a Pizza Hut."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything we ate was delicious. The burger was great. The mac n cheese was terrific. And they have fresh cut fries. Add a ton of beer options and you have the making of the best place around Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I need another run at this place. The craft drafts are ample in selection but the service was not ads efficient as it should or may be. I enjoy the prices and the app selection seems fun! Good ambiance, solid for parking...I will be doing another run~!"}
{"text":"New to the area over the last 6 months. Every single time we go to Dad's we are greeted with friendly and attentive service. The bar is great, tons of beer choices. The food is amazing...think Mac and cheese, burgers, fried apps, hot dogs, etc. Delicious. Also, patio is super nice and dog friendly.   Prices are extremely reasonable. Will continue to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Dad's is my favorite baresturant in Monroeville.  Everything I've tried has been really good.  (Wings, hoagies, burgers, apps, onion rings, fries) I have not left unhappy with my meal."}
{"text":"Yes, I agree with the other happy diners here - great food and service, great beer selection.  Great oasis in an area where non-chain place are very few and far between.  Support independent restaurant owners and enjoy yourself at the same time!"}
{"text":"I knew what I was in for as I approached Dad's Pub from the street.  It's a pub, and I was going to eat pub grub for dinner.  With that mindset in place, I was really pleased with what I found inside.  What a cool little joint!    Nice menu options, and a step or two above the typical pub grub food you would expect.  I ordered the brisket sandwich with a side of onion rings and a Founders IPA.  Bliss!!!  Everything was served quickly even though they were very busy.  The food was hot, and cooked perfectly.  So happy that I was directed to this place via the YELP app.  If you are traveling through the area and are considering this place like I did, I highly recommend you drop in for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I were big fans of Dz Dogz.  Nothing has changed regarding food quality:  Dad's Pub and Grub is a great little (well, not so little) neighborhood pub.  There isn't a bad sandwich.  The salads are large and fresh.  The chips are great.  The dogs (my favorite) are imaginative, consistent in preparation and taste wonderful.  Wings are excellent and the beer is cold and plentiful.  The staff always gives the impression that they are a team.  Atmosphere is boisterous at times, but in a healthy, happy way.  Don't feel like cooking after all that yard work?  Looking for a bite that won't break the bank?  Want to try a different beer?  Starved for a great dog?  This is the place!"}
{"text":"Really busy place especially on the weekends. We were lucky to find an open table here in the bar section. The walls are lined with different select beers, domestic and foreign and they even have 6 packs to go as well.   We just wanted to eat and drink so I grabbed a caesar salad and some chili while the hubby ordered a chicago dog and chili as well. He was interested in the dog fish bites for an appetizer which I'm glad he ordered because they were awesome!!. The batter was on the sweet side which made them taste so great with the tartar sauce.  My salad was awesome too although they cut the romaine a little too skinny so it took me about 30 minutes to eat it. The chili is definitely the best I have had in years. Maybe the best ever. No kidney beans and very spicy. A little too spicy but still delicious as ever. The chili had sooo much flavor and I'm very pleased at how hot it was when It came out especially considering the crowds. Hubby agreed its the best he's ever had as well along with his chicago dog. I wanted to have a bite but I couldn't because he finished it all.  We tossed back several beers and even tried their high octane imperial red ale which is about 10.2% ABV. We split it of course because of the high level of spirits. We were a little on the tipsy side but still good enough to drive. The chili really helped absorb the beer so we drank.   We had a great time here and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great pub food and terrific service. Hot dog was incredible. Fries were tasty but a little limp for my liking."}
{"text":"I'm a little mystified at the 5-star ratings this place is getting. I've been here quite a few times, and the food is good... A notch above most bar food. Service is usually pleasant, but they're usually a little light on staff. I'm really not complaining, I'll be back and I'll like it. But 5-stars? Maybe better the next time."}
{"text":"Great place for craft beer.  The food is amazing at good prices.  You have to come here for happy hour- different everyday, Thursday's 3.50 select great lakes drafts! Best of all, for me anyways, NO SMOKING! If you are in the Monroeville area, this is a stop you must make."}
{"text":"Nice little Hot Dog - Burger Joint.  Great place to take your dad for a meal!  Large selection of beers. The dogs are a good and snap to your bite.  My fav is the Chicago dog with the sport pepper and celery salt.  The snacks include some big onion rigs that come with a tasty spicy sauce and Pub Chips with your choice of seasoning.  The menu does have sandwiches, salads, wings and pizza.     Very friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"Great bar food and extensive craft beer selection. The mac n cheese really is awesome! Prices are reasonable and it is family friendly."}
{"text":"We were traveling and stopped for the night and got a room. Yelp helped out big time with this place.  Great choices of craft beer and wide choices if good options.  We were both satisfied with the meal and service."}
{"text":"Not sure if I would call it a \"gastropub,\" but I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes I tried here for lunch during a long car ride to DC. The zucchini strips appetizer, with garlic sauce and marinara mixed together for dipping as our excellent waitress suggested, was really good. The strips themselves were cut long and thin, resulting in plenty of surface area for the flaky breading and parmesan cheese crust. I ordered the brisket grilled cheese for my entree, which arrived piping hot on thick buttered toast, loaded with brisket and cheese filling. Was really tasty, and had enough structural integrity to stay together quite well. The side of fresh cut fries was mostly an afterthought, but was good nonetheless. All in all, infinitely better than any other PA turnpike rest-stop option I've tried in the past! I'd love to return and have a beer as well."}
{"text":"We stayed overnight and went to Dad's for dinner. We ordered the fried provolone cheese sticks and onion rings for appetizers. Both were delicious! Our main meals consisted of the Popeye pizza, yinzer burger, and cheese pizza. Everything came out hot and could tell was freshly made from scratch. Staff was friendly and helpful. If we ever pass through this area again we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Stayed nearby recently and found Dad's on Yelp. Loved my meal and would be back. I was traveling on business by myself so I was only able to try a couple of things, but the menu looked so good that I struggled to limit myself. Their beer selection is amazing too (they have a mystery pint, for a deal, which I had). When I'm on the road (150+ days per year), I often just wind-up at a national chain of some kind for ease and convenience; if more places like Dad's existed, I'd go there for sure!"}
{"text":"A girlfriend of mine raves about this place, but mostly for it's craft beer selection. Which, is pretty epic and I found two new delicious winter beers to obsess over.   We each ordered a gyro. I always opt for sweet potato fries but was shocked to see a $3 upcharge on my bill at the end. I looked again at the menu and the price tag for the sweet potato fries is completely covered by the fold in the menu. Bummer.   The gyro was a gyro. My friend's regular fries did look amazing though so I was extra - salty - about my expensive sweet potato selection (they were good don't get me wrong but the regular fries definitely were better). Oh, and the bartender wasn't really friendly at all.   So yea, lots of great beer! The menu did have a lot of potentially delicious items which I will definitely go back to try. My friend said their buffalo chicken is good, so that is next up on my list. And while it does face the highway, the outdoor patio is a great feature, and I am looking forward to hanging out there next year."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  Good bar food.  Average pricing.  New outdoor seating is nice."}
{"text":"I've been to Dads a number of times but I feel that I'm finally ready to write a review for them.  During my visits I have ordered different items on the menu but I don't go to Dad's for the food.  I go there because they always have a good beer selection.    You can order a good pizza, get wings, hot dogs, even chili here and be satisfied.  My overall rating for the food would be a 6 out of 10.  It's not bad, not great, but it's good bar type food.    The service is ok here.  The hostesses are always very friendly and when I've encountered the wait stuff they were good too.  I don't always feel that great about the bartenders though.  You never know what you are going to get.  There is a girl that has always been nice to my wife and I.   We do  hope that she is there when we visit.  Everyone else there is either just ok or not that good.    A few examples...  A month ago myself and my two brothers stopped by after work.  It wasn't too busy and we were watching the Pirates game.  The bartender was fine.  Just not too remember able.  He took our drinks and we paid him.  That's it just average.  Then my wife and I stopped by here this past Sunday and it was more of the same.  I think good bartenders should have character and like to interact with people they don't know.  It gets us coming back.  This just doesn't happen here with most of the bartenders that we have ran into.  The thing I will not forget about the girl who was serving us this last time happened when we first got there.   Anyways.  We did have a good time because of the drinks.  They always have a good selection of beer that we like.  They let us sample it and we end of having a good time at Dads.  If the bartenders (other than the one girl that we like) were better I think we would come here a lot more often."}
{"text":"In the search for a new local bar that features craft and local beer, we made our way to Dad's. On our sampling trip, we sat at the bar fairly late on a Sunday night. There were plenty of great beers to choose from, and the bartender took our order and delivered our drinks promptly. The full bar also offers wine, mixed drinks and specialty cocktails.   We ordered a variety of late night snacks to sample: fried zucchini, hot cheese balls, Mac n cheese, and beer battered French fries. We loved the Mac n cheese and fries! The zucchini needed a bit more zucchini, and we were expecting the hot cheese balls to be a little spicier, but we liked them with the honey mustard dipping sauce.   I got the vibe that this was the D's of Monroeville and I think that's great. The menu is varied with lots of vegetarian options. Service was friendly, and it seemed like the other guests were regulars. To end on another compliment, I liked that the tvs in the restaurant weren't just playing sports. There's something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Passing through Monroeville and visiting family.  Looking for someplace we had not tried before.  WOW what a neat concept for a former pizza hut building.  Dad's started out as a food truck and wanted brick and morter.  They really pulled it off.  There is a great beer menu, but they had a nice selection of hard stuff and wine as well.  Burgers looked fantastic, but no one at our table tried one this time.  Everyone loved what we had and we also devoured an order of the home made chips to boot.  We also finished our dinner off with a fried twinkie.  We are not local, but we will be back next time we are passing through."}
{"text":"Beer Selection great, food really good. Kirsten was a great bartender! I've found my spot when traveling to Monroeville!!"}
{"text":"Came to try cuz good reviews.  Small restaurant so there was a wait when we arrived but seats opened at the bar which was nice.  Lots of beer choices but disappointed that they didn't have any of the white wine in stock.  Tried the fried provolone sticks and very delicious. We had a burger and the gouda brisket sandwich.  Both were very good and both came with a large pile of fries.  Plenty of food and couldn't finish all of it."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.   The food is all great.  Burgers are amazing, but mame sure you are hungry because they are huge.    Their pizza is sneaky good as well.   I normally wouldn't think of this type of place for good pizza, but it definitely is.     The atmosphere is very casual and can get loud if packed.    It is just a fun place with good food.   What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This review is actually for \"Dad's mobile grub\"; the Dad's Pub & Grub food truck. I grabbed a gyro (pronounced yee-ro, for all you 'Burghers that still say JY-RO, of which I got some crazy looks from people in front of me who just ordered when I said it) from here during the Sewickley night mart last night. It was just...eh, pretty good. The meat itself was actually kind of watery, I think due to the fact that they put some sort of cucumber-like sauce on top. I actually ended up nabbing the last one. There were also 3 bottles of empty ketchup just hanging out, of which one patron waited about 10 minutes to get a new bottle. Might want to consider extra help on the Sewickley Night Marts nights!  I think the meat needs to be prepared using another method. I don't know that I would try their brick and mortar just yet."}
{"text":"Beer battered French fries??? Yes, please!!! Seriously, how is this not a common thing? I'm not even sure how to explain these other than amazing. Dipping them in ranch dressing was the perfect accompaniment.   The egg on my burger is what prevents my review from being 5 stars. The yolk was cooked all the way through. It had some black flecks on It, like from a cast iron pan. It gave the egg a bit of a metallic taste. If my build your own burger hadn't included the egg, 5 stars all the way. A menu that turns the ideas of bar food up a notch.  Service was good. The pub isn't huge, and has a nice covered patio.   Whether you are a local, or just passing through don't forget to take a little time out to visit Dad's."}
{"text":"Originally a hidden gem in Monroeville, Dad's has jumped to the top of the list when dining in Monroeville! With a never ending selection of beers on tap and in cans and bottles, Dads is the perfect spot for lunch, dinner, watch the game, or catching up with friends! Dad's menu has a wide variety of features including huge burgers, awesome hot dogs, deep bowl salads, filling pizzas, and other awesome appetizers! There is also a variety of seasonal menu options that are all home made goodness!! The staff that works there makes you feel not like a customer, but more like a family member!!! When the weather cooperates, the outside patio is a great feature that you have to use!! They also have a monthly Sunday Brunch with a make your own Bloody Mary bar that is perfect! I highly suggest Dad's to everyone that comes through Monroeville!"}
{"text":"Bartender was nice. Hostess forgot about us.  Owner said he would buy us a round of drinks. No one ever came over, so we left."}
{"text":"Everything is good. They use actual steak on their steak salad, which is rare! My favorite thing about dads is that they are dog friendly! We love having our pup on the patio."}
{"text":"This place is great, the service is friendly, the burger was outstanding and the beer selection is second to none. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for food or drinks. To bad I was just passing through and will only get to experience this place once."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place!  Burgers and pub fries are the best here. Reubens are big and flavorful as well. Basically you can't go wrong choosing anything on the menu. Large portions for a great price and flavor for days. If I could eat this food every day, i would. Also a great revolving draft beer selection and wall of bottled beers complete with build your own 6 packs. I always try to come here when people are in the mood for really good and filling bar food that actually tastes good. They also have a Bloody Mary Bar!"}
{"text":"Dad's is even better since the boys bought the place from D's.  And they have truly made it their own!   Some menu items have been removed, some have been added... but all is for the best.  Their award-winning chili and wedding soup are offered daily.  I can still get my Pittsburgh-style steak salad (one of my favorite things on the menu!) and a large number of burgers, sandwiches, and pizzas.  Dad's also has some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.  I don't even like sweet potatoes.  A large basket will feed your table.   A new addition to the menu are the delicious desserts! They are slightly pricey but homemade and definitely worth a try.    Dad's has a large number of taps, including many local, seasonal, and imported favorites. They of course \"inherited\" hundreds of bottled beers in the coolers and a small \"beer outcove.\"  Since they have a full bar in addition to their taps, Dad's is able to offer daily drink specials ($5 Monroeville Mules on Wednesday!).  If you go there during a Penguins, Steelers or Pirates game, there are many game-day drink and food specials to enjoy.   What I like the best about this place is that unlike D's, the bar stays open \"until dad says\", meaning they actually structure their hours around the crowd (or lack thereof). Finally!   Way to go, Kelvo and Dan.  Five star review."}
{"text":"I have driven by several time and didn't give Dad's a second look. Big mistake on my part. Dad's is a unique local place, my favorite kind of place. I had a cup of chili and a Mushroom Swiss Burger. Both were outstanding.  The Chili had a great flavor with chunks of peppers (not for the faint of heart).  The burger was huge and messy but delicious.  The portabello mushroom covered the entire burger and tasted like it was marinated. I will definately be back."}
