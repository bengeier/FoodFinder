{"text":"Nice place with a good crowd, but don't buy  drinks if you plan on using the washrooms.  The bouncers won't let you downstairs with your drink (which happens to be where the washrooms are), and they won't look after them for you... :-/"}
{"text":"Way too crowded. Way too hot. Way too loud. Way too expensive.  This place just reminded me of a more out-of-the-way version of the Brunny. I guess the only thing it has going for it is that there's live music. Boo-ha, the band just played what would be playing in the background anyway, aka annoying pub anthems that you tend to hear a lot of near St. Patty's Day. I barely noticed a difference except that they were annoyingly loud compared to what a jukebox might have been. Honestly, it was so loud I didn't even hear frat boy's cheesy pickup line that I had to ask to hear it twice.   I would choose not to come back. I don't see what all the hype is about."}
{"text":"Love the $2 wings on Mondays - they used to be $1 and 10c before that but it's still cheap. The nachos are a huge and the platter is great as well. Downside is that the other food is horrible and sometimes the service is pretty sketchy."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiancé before a TIFF movie a few weeks ago. It was completely empty. We got seated right in the middle and saw about 6 waitresses standing around doing nothing, just chit-chatting with one another, checking their phones, etc. It honestly took about 20 minutes until a waitress finally realized we were there. She apologized and said she didn't know that the section we were seated in was her section. She was nice about it so we let it slide (at first). We placed our order, she didn't write it down. She came back about 10-15 minutes later confirming our order (Ie: what flavour of wings was it again? Did you want beef on your nachos?) so she hadn't put in the order at all. We waited about 30 minutes for water, even after asking her two times. She came back and said, \"Oh yeah, the water!!!\" and still didn't bring it to us for another 10 minutes. She also kept forgetting my fiancé's rum & coke, took her another 15 minutes to bring it out. Mind you, the bar was DEAD the entire time. There was maybe 4 tables max. Every time we looked over, our waitress was chit-chatting, not getting waters and not getting our drinks. She was ditzy and very forgetful. She did apologize but after many mistakes after mistakes, apologies don't mean anything. We're lucky we got out of there on time to make our movie. My reco to the management: Efficiently staff your bar so that they aren't hanging around not doing anything, also, tell them to get the hell off of their phones and to tend to their customers. It's not that hard to fetch water when you've got about 11 patrons in the entire establishment and an excessive amount of waiters/waitresses chit-chatting away and ignoring customers."}
{"text":"I've never had a particularly enjoyable experience here. I don't think it's based on any issues with the establishment and staff itself. The vibe just isn't interesting, exciting, or novel, and other places in Toronto do what this place does better."}
{"text":"Real Irish pubs do not charge a cover.  Real Irish men do not pay a cover.  Friends of real Irish men do not pay a cover.  And neither should you.  Not in Dublin, and certainly not in Toronto."}
{"text":"I always have a very fun time at Grace O'Malley's. It's very busy on Thursday and Friday nights, so go early to avoid waiting in line. They do charge cover, which I find super annoying, but if you have a student card - it's free. They usually have a live band - sometimes an east coast band. In between sets, they usually play top 40. It's a good place for a group because it pleases the club and pub crowd."}
{"text":"Judgemental @ssholes!!!!!  I went to Grace O'Malley's tonight. I had one drink, and knowing I reached my limit, was at the bar drinking water, conversing with my friend.   Before I could argue, I was then escorted out of the facility. When I asked why I I was being escorted out, staff answered \"because I was intoxicated\". I agreed that I had enough to drink, and stopped over an hour ago. I knew I had not been violent, aggressive, or vulgar in language or behaviour during my stay. I had already stopped consuming alcohol over an hour ago. When I asked why I was being escorted out, the staff simply stated that all they could do was retrieve my coat from coatcheck. but I was not permitted back into the facility. I was never offered an opportunity to defend my position. My opinion was simply dismissed by staff. I was dismissed based on a presumed outcome and behaviour, but not one that actually occurred.  I was unfairly judged by staff at Grace O'Malley's Do not go to this establishment!!"}
{"text":"I would give this club a 0 if I could, shittiest place I've ever been, and I'm from Halifax and lived in Toronto for 7 months (so I know good places to Drink) this place is garbage."}
{"text":"Total Shit. Charged us $13 cover and then no seats for us. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"Was ignored when I walked in, even though I lingered near the bar, trying to figure out if I should seat myself at a table or wait to be seated. After making eye contact with a bar tender or server, who looked at me, but didn't greet me or direct me in anyway, I seated myself. After sitting for 5 mins, a very nice server came along and asked me if anyone had been by yet.  When I said no, she said she would go get the server who's area I was sitting in. I saw her go over to the bar and talk to other workers, but no one came within 5 more mins.  So I put on my coat and left."}
{"text":"\"You guys left money right?\"   ... Are you serious? Because that's the absolute last thing you would ever want to hear while leaving a restaurant- especially after experiencing one of the worst service ever, and we like eating out a lot.  Now I understand why this place is headed downhill. Informally known as \"Gracie's\", used to be one of my favourite hangout spots, with good food and a great atmosphere. But tonight's baffling experienced was the last slap in the face.   Our poor excuse of a server forgot almost every order we left- even after we had to chase her down several times. Mind you, this was a Monday night. What ticked us off was that there was absolutely no sign of remorse or concern for her lack of professionalism or even ability to remember anything we requested. She certainly didn't forget to remind us that last call was at 10:30pm ... well, it soon became 10:45 (almost 40 minutes after we ordered), and we still yet to receive some of our order. Guess who forgot to punch it in? Guess who didn't forget to handle the whole situation with a simple one-word response, \"shit\"? I guess mommy and manager forgot to teach you your mannerisms.  What I find so amusing with some servers is that the moment you are ready to pay for your cheque, that's when your server immediately decides to become an attentive angel. I'm sorry, where was this accommodating service during my entire meal? That is not how you are going to earn your undeserved tip, honey.  Regardless, my dining partner and I still left a tip that we felt reflected the (lack of) service we received. And we were being generous. But the biggest ball kicker that topped off the entire shittastic night was that as we were leaving, the server had the audacity to chase after us to the door to ask us, \"you guys left money right?\"  What could anything even DRIVE you to make such a bold, unwarranted assumption such as dining without payment? And have the insolence to embarrass honest customers with such a outrageous accusation?  The fact that a business is willing to humiliate themselves and even entertain the idea of accusing without any reason, does not deserve my business and certainly not my respect."}
{"text":"$2 Monday Chicken Wings Special as long as you buy a drink was the only reason I went. Been there a couple of times, first time wasn't that bad. food came out promptly, service wasn't too bad and the washroom downstairs wasn't super horrible.   However, my most recent experience with a few friends was pretty bad. The server was super nice and friendly but because the place was pretty busy we lacked service when we needed it. Our food came out SUPER slow and a couple of my friends wing orders came out wrong a few times. The upstairs woman's washroom is freezing cold and stinks like urine.  To end this with a positive note, if you do for whatever reason come here, get the Irish Nachos. They are pretty good and you get your moneys worth! =)"}
{"text":"Great place and environment for drinks and dancing.  I have been a few times. Coat check is usually pretty long, and getting a drink takes a while because it's really crowded. Overall, great experience and will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I went to this establishment a couple times with different groups of people. All times the floors were incredibly STICKY. I'm not sure if it was the aftermath of an event the nigh before, or weeks before. I think this because the \"dance floor\" area is exceptionally sticky as well as the path down the stairs to the washrooms.  It never seems clean.   I generally looked pass the sticky floors to enjoy the food here. Their fish and chips are pretty good; the size of their fish is admirable.  I would only need one-piece if I were to ever got here again. keyword: \"IF\". Ever since my last experience there, I plan on ever going to Grace O'Malley's anytime ever.   I checked out their Wing Night deal on a Monday evening the LAST time I was there. My guest and I both checked out the Wings description in the menu and decided on the flavours. We got our wings with dip and veggie sticks (since they were outlined on the menu as part of the dish).  The wings were nicely fried but they lacked any real flavour. What we didn't know was the DIP and 4 -5? pieces of VEGGIES were an additional $6? to OUR BILL. We asked for more chicken sauce because the wings lacked in so much flavour, the waitress, again, neglected to inform us that was another additional charge.  I forget teh EXACT pricing of these things but it added an extra $10+? to our bill.  Had we been informed of these charges, we would have known to choose our sides wisely. Who would have ever thought depressing veggie sticks and a dollop of dip would cost so much more? It's extremely unreasonable and to make matters worse they were unexpected additions to our bill. Despicable.  The waitress was extremely ignorant to her negligence and poor customer service. If she did her job, she would have informed us of conditions that are nowhere displayed n the poster or menu.   before the above transpired, my guest and I decided to get dessert. Chocolate lava cake. Yum? NO. It was barley even lukewarm. It was essentially a microwavable cake in it's presentation and, most importantly, taste and texture. It was disgusting. I felt sick after eating a portion of it (I should have stopped when i felt how cold it was in the first bite). It completely RUINED the entire meal and this was before the bill rolled around.   I had plans to come here with other people but since this experience, those plans are never more. The service was poor, incompetent, and rude. The wings were flavourless and the cake was sickening. I am so over Grace O'Malley's. Never Again."}
{"text":"I always have a great time here. Being from the East Coast, I'm a little biased but the atmosphere is fun, the bands are usually excellent and the staff and bouncers are awesome. No matter what our plans are at the beginning of the evening, my friends and I always seem to end up at Gracie's."}
{"text":"The girls here were very very nice.  You know what I mean?  Amazing eye candy.  But they were rude.  Crowded also.  Drinks were decently priced, I think 2 red-bull vodkas were only 16?    Way too crowded for my liking but 3 stars cuz of the amazing band playing."}
{"text":"I've been to way better bars.  This place used to be fun, no or very little cover and a cool hang out spot.  It's now turned into desperate guys (too desperate) girls wearing dresses you can see their bums hanging out and if that's not enough they play the typical top 40 and you have to pay $13 to get into a pub. Really? Now that being said if you want to hook up a sleezy random really quick, this is the way to go.  I used to like this place but now they are considered a \"club\" I wouldn't bother. Save your time. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Pretty solid bar if you're looking for a place with friendly clientele / staff and reasonable prices. The cover was a little more than I was expecting ($13), but the drink prices were pretty reasonable considering the live music / packed venue.  I'm a little biased towards this bar as I lost my new iPhone 4S on the premises last weekend. However, one of the male bartenders found, and took it upon himself to find me to return it. That level of honesty leaves me with a good impression of this spot as a good place to grab a drink rather than the other sketchier bars/clubs in the area that might not be so honest.  Check it out."}
{"text":"My daughter and her friend both had their iPhones stolen out of their purses there last night- be careful."}
{"text":"Go there Thursday night for the music and the crowd. The drinks aren't cheap (but there are $12 pitchers) you can get in free with a student card and the crowd is University students and young Bay street professionals.   The music is AMAZING. All catchy with a mix of new top 40, oldies, country, rock, etc. Sometimes there are live bands which are great as well- def. a great Thursday night spot!"}
{"text":"I like this place but the security is really in polite they took my property even after I told him I'm calling a Uber.  Besides that,they actually pushed me outside out of the place without even saying that they are closing."}
{"text":"Went for the Monday night wings special, left hungry and disappointed.  They have a sneakily advertised Monday night wings special where you order a drink and get 1lb of wings for $3 all night. What our server failed to tell us was that you have to purchase a drink with EVERY pound of wings you order.  She didn't tell us that until we tried ordering our second pound. Would've been courteous if she told us earlier..  Also important to note their idea of a pound is 6 or 7 under average sized wings, LIGHTLY sauced (ie. more than half the wing, for every single wing, is dry and flavourless). You don't get the blue cheese and ranch dressing they advertise on the menu if you get a lazy server like we did (\"Toril\" or something). You don't get any vegetables either (2 or 3 carrot and celery sticks are standard practice).  Avoid this place. There are TONS of other places with decent wing nights. This isn't worth it."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place. I probably won't go back. The waitress was nice the only problem was she didn't know the different types of beer and who made the beer. We also waited for twenty five minutes for chicken wings and nachos. On a Monday night. That's a waiting a little to long for those items."}
{"text":"Quite fun!  Went here on a Saturday night and the crowd was BANGING. The music was loud and the dance floor was full.   It was my friend's birthday so she got in with free cover and acquired many a free drink by the happy crowd. We- the friends- were on her guest list but there really is no reason to sign up at all. There was no line to cut and no discount on cover so... what's the point? Also frustrating, is that the cover charge seems to spike as the night goes on so by the time we got there it was $13 to get in. For a pub it seemed a bit odd and certainly the most money I've ever paid to get into a place like this.   There was a non-intimidating DJ who took requests but I'm sorry to say, he did not play Willow Smith's \"Whip My Hair\" as I kindly suggested. In his defense, he was thinking about the crowd as a whole and deemed them \"not ready\" for a song of this caliber.   Then a band came on and they were great too! Wish I got their name but they played covers of fun songs. Some I knew, some I didn't but it didn't matter because everyone was having a ball."}
{"text":"Monday nights- One pound of wings $2 and $12 pitchers  Can't go wrong with beer and wings."}
{"text":"This place should be judged for what it tries to be and not what everyone wants it to be. It is NOT supposed to be a fancy place. Yes, the beer menu is basic (that's Okay, if you want diversity go to Bier Markt and wait 2 hrs in line) but does the job. The place is indeed kinda grimy, but every once in a while that's what you want. Do not expect to find interesting and good looking people - it's a place to get drunk and have a good time.  The food is interesting - had the east coast doner - a MASSIVE portion (so MASSIVE that I could only eat half... and I am a big kid who loves his food). Delicious as well, with a nice condensed milk sauce (did I say this place is NOT fancy) but you know what, it did the trick and had a great time.  Only 4 out of 5 start because it is really grimy and I know several pubs that I would prefer over this. But you know what... the place does what it's supposed to... and this is why it earns its stars..."}
{"text":"I had a fine red ale. This was a substitute as their normal tap dark was out. Yummy.  For dinner I had the chicken pot pie. The crust was excellent, but the pie hadn't been in the microwave long enough and was warm, but not hot. Obviously not really just out of the oven. The veggies were ok, not thrilling. The mashed potatoes were so so, and the gravy was clearly a mix.  My companion had the fish and chips. The fish was excellent, but the chips were poor."}
{"text":"Horribly sticky floors,  reminiscent of walking on fly paper. Bland \"food\",  generic beer selection. I'm not returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to Grace O'Malley's several times for my class' annual holiday party.  It has a cozy pub appeal.  Drinks are average prices, about $7 for a pint.  A live band plays on the more popular nights, (I was there on a Friday night and they had a band).  Being a pub, not a club, you think they would turn down the background music so that you are catch up with people.  Nope, they had it blaring in the background and it was like I was yelling at my friends the whole night.  I will likely be back for the next annual Christmas holiday party next year."}
{"text":"I despise the crowd that dances here. But then again I'm not 19. The staff and music though are pretty great, although cover is absolutely teeth grinding ridiculous. $5 I could swallow but $13 is effing stupid. Never had the food but the bar is decent."}
{"text":"Great place to catch a game, and grab a bite. Service here is good as well."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot to add, paying cover to drink a pint isn't something I like to do, but I do understand that the bands need to get paid. And the bands come from a-far.  This place is totally NOT my style. But, I was with a few other folks from the East Coast. So, the only point to going to Grace O'Malley's is to reunite with othe East Coasters and listen to bands from the East Coast.  I'm not against East Coasters, I can't wait to visit Halifax where I can drink a pint there."}
{"text":"I have to say there's an allure to Grace o malleys Central with live music. Staff seem personable and food was reasonable for bar food. we came for a stag party the waitress never said what she would do with the bill but the way service was handled we assumed they were going to group us all together.  Took a long time to sort out the bill and this was made abundantly clear that as customers that was our responsibility. I won't say thats necessarily a bad thing for everyone but i consider it bad service."}
{"text":"We ate there twice and both time got table removed during dinner. \"You have 5 minutes, ok? We have to take this table away after.\" Very unapologetic attitude."}
{"text":"I've only ever gone to this place for the two dollar Monday chicken wing special ($2 wings with drinks) with friends on a couple occasions. The experience seems to be getting progressively worse. Wing orders frequently come out wrong, cold or overcooked and the rest of the food is just average pub food. Nothing really exciting. Suicide wings ARE crazy hot and fun for a group to try...and have resulted in friends of mine in the washroom with tears running down their face. Fun! Irish Nachos are also pretty decent and large. Recently the place has gotten a little questionable in terms of hygiene. There are some, uh, strong smells in a couple areas including the entrance (really?). If I can't walk into your bar without it smelling like piss, I'm not likely to come back two dollar wings or not.  May get dragged here in the future and will update my review if things improve."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as a person who only comes to Gracies to party. I know it's a restaurant during the day so do not read this if that is the review you are interested in... BUT if you are interested in getting fucked up, dancing and slamming Jagger Bombs until 2 am, then this is the review for you my friends.  Good old Gracies. Gracies Gracies Gracies, what can I even say... Gracies will always hold a special place in my heart.   Bouncers have been the same since I moved downtown and started going there 6-7 years ago, strictly business kind of guys but do a fantastic job keeping everybody safe and never power trip, they have always been fair and have even helped me out in a pinch a couple times. Bartenders are cool. Drink specials always changing. Reasonably priced booze. Music changes back and forth from live bands to top 40 which is fun. Usually by the time \"My sex is on fire\" comes on you're too fucked up to care what's playing anyways.  Wanted to dock a few stars because I met my ex girlfriend here but I know it wasn't Gracie's fault... and we did have some good times I guess.  Place gets packed, Thursdays are busiest. Still solid Friday/Saturday nights.  I love Grace O'Malley's."}
{"text":"This place is classic bottom line. Pub food is decent. And they have fun trivia nights. When it's busy service is slow but you don't notice it since it can be a lively crowd. Very central and they have fun music to dance to on weekends!"}
{"text":"Yo great value for happy hour.. Good staff... Great wings and Adam is a most convivial bartender... Lets me vent after a long day at work and still keeps up with the rush... #respect"}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations of the food after reading some of their reviews but our experience with the food wasn't terrible. Considering it's basic pub food, I found the menu to be overpriced. We ended up getting the veg nachos ($12) which we found to be the most reasonable item on the menu. It wasn't bad at all and portion size was pretty good, easily good enough for 3-4 people depending on the group's hunger level.   The drink special for Wednesday was $5 domestic pints and bar rail. I think they had about a dozen domestic beer options to choose from which is good.   Service was also average/below average, one of the servers was taking orders while chewing gum (disgusting! It's a pet peeve of mine).    If I come back here it'll only be to grab a drink or two."}
{"text":"This location was definitely not my cup of tea. This place was overcrowded and it was only a Thursday night. It was definitely quite difficult to get around from the bar, to finding a seat and squeezing through a tight space to the washroom. They have a dance floor where the DJ cannot transition from one song to another properly (the radio has better transitions). The DJ also mainly played a mix of a few old song with country. Have the people on the floor were making out and I believe 75%  of the people were either first or second year university students. Music is blasting and the floor as well as the table tops were sticky with spilt drinks everywhere. It is definitely to even reach the bar but I would have to admit that the only plus side is that the bartenders are all quite handsome, quick and still surprises me as to how they can hear our orders over the music. Overall, I would probably not return unless to this location.  Ps, there is a $5 entry fee"}
{"text":"Hesitant at first due to the \"not so great\" reviews. But I trusted the guy who loved the Guinness steak pie and he was NOT wrong. I've had steaks that didn't have that much steak on them; it was loaded. Think of a chicken pot pie with steak, brown gravy, and mushrooms cooked to perfection. It's 7pm on a Tuesday night and the server said, \"you got the last one.\"  It definitely goes fast.   I really love IPAs, but they are hard to find in bars up here, but the Boneshaker is very good. They have a number of good beers to choose from, so you can have a variety. I really glad I found this place."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a few beers on our very first night in Toronto, and we were pleasantly surprised. It was a very quiet Sunday night, and we were some of the only customers in the bar around 10pm. This worked out to our advantage because we had unrestricted views of the Sunday night NFL game on several huge screens, and bar service as soon as or before our glasses got empty. The bartender was super cool, and also recommended a few hot spots for us to check out while we were in the city (some of his picks were spot on).  As far as the bar/restaurant goes, I totally love the decor. There is a giant \"tree\" growing up through part of the bar, which I really wanted to take a picture of but the lighting just would not cooperate. It's full of a lot of the usual stuff you see in Irish pubs these days, but also many that you don't, including full sets of armor and some awesome old stove looking thing. They definitely went outside the scope of cliche wall art.  I wish we had come back here again maybe to eat or get more drinks, as I definitely feel this has the potential to rank up there with the better Irish themed places I've been to. So consider Grace's to be a 4, with the definitely possibility of a 5!"}
{"text":"Gracies is a Toronto staple with amazing staff. Danielle always has a glass of wine ready for me after work. Can't go wrong with $4 happy hour! It's a great place to hide out and watch the game"}
{"text":"Hanging out in Toronto for New Years and needed to get out of the cold so decided to pop into O'Malley's. Nearly 7pm and almost no one in the place. Dive bar atmosphere with decent drinks and the bartender was laid back. I would have given it a 3 or 4 if I didn't have to share the bar with a cockroach. The bartender did the right thing and bought our drinks after smoothly removing our friend the roach who honestly was probably just trying to get out of the cold himself. I really can't seem to find a good spot in Toronto. I'll have to keep looking."}
{"text":"Seems super Fratty and kind of an extension of university, which isn't great. Also, cover at a pub? Cmon. But at least the music is good and the leafs fans are happy..."}
{"text":"Grace O Malley's is one location I despise going in to because the crowd in there is simply not my type. Even most bands that perform here have give me no interest and with nothing special going for this bar be it the lack of a friendly/efficient staff, annoying cover charges, overpriced drinks, large crowds and long wait times at the bar I have to put my foot down and give it that rare one star rating from my end.   I can't say it's got nothing that's good about it, it's got seats inside....and I must admit that it does cater to a certain niche of people that seems to love it since it's always crowded.   I believe I've been here twice and you would be hard pressed to find me checking in here anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Nice little plate of fish and chips, good atmosphere. Dark inside but I enjoyed it. Maybe a bit pricey for drinks but that seems to be the norm in Toronto. I went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't overly crowded."}
{"text":"The CN Tower, ROM, AGO are all distractions. The only thing that matters in Toronto is Gracie's on a Thursday night.  Get there around 10:30pm or you're gonna be waiting in line all night.  They have sweet cover bands there that play old classics from Bruce Springsteen, Steve Miller Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, etc.  I think they have food there, but I've only ever had beer.  Beyond that, no amount of characters can explain Gracie's.  Do yourself a favour and go to Gracie's next Thursday night. Guaranteed you will be back on Friday night."}
{"text":"terrible job, grace o malleys.   I've haven't been so upset with service until now, that it fuelled me to create a yelp account solely to warn people to stay away from an establishment as poor as yours.   server was subpar, bartender was inattentive, and the manager was indifferent to everything going on. won't be coming back here.   they even raised the price on their \"half price wings\". how else can they make their rent?"}
{"text":"Food was hot and tasty. Not fast, but reasonable prices. The original burger was tasty! Fish burrito was okay. And the sweet potato fries were lovely."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we go there on a Saturday night and the place did not disappoint! I can't say much about the food since we got there around 10.30 but the place certainly did not disappoint.   The cover was nine dollars which I consider pretty decent on a Saturdat night. There was a live band playing and the atmosphere in general was tons of fun. During the band's break the DJ started playing songs that you can actually dance to (unlike some other places I've been to) so it was easy to get in the mood and let loose!  It does get super crowded after 11.30 so you don't have much space to move so if you like your space while dancing you might wanna get there a bit early to get the best of both worlds. Lastly, this is a CASUAL place!!! If you're looking for a formal place to get dressed up ect. Grace's is not the place to be. That is not to say you can't look good, just don't overdo it. Overall, it's a great place to be to just have fun. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Last night I was here for a speed dating event.  I have wound up at this place a few times now but never before things really get going based on the comments below.  It does not sound like I'm really in the right demographic anyway.  So yes, this is one of many bars that is supposed to make you feel like you are in an Irish pub.  I wonder if there are Canadian themed bars in Ireland.  I tried to order a Negroni but she didn't know what that was.  She had *heard* of the Manhattan but informed me that the bar usually just does basic drinks.  Um, yeah...something about me not being the right demo for this place...  With my vodka tonic (beer at speed dating = big mistake) I went around and had my ten mini dates of five mins. each.  The place is a bit loud for speed dating.  I think a few vultures flew in from another table to try and snap up some leftovers after the event was done.  They *did* certainly look like *that* demo.  PRO TIP: don't bother paying for the speed dating event.  Just hang around and then, when it is done, you can swoop in.  I assume I'll end up here again for one reason or another.  Its location makes it an easy place to meet up.  No real complaints if you just want a pint after work.  My guess is that this place is a lot of fun if you are early twenties and want to get drunk."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favourite Toronto bars! I love how packed it always is, especially the dance floor.  I realize a lot of people would find that to be a fault, but I think it's part of what makes Gracie's so much fun! Everywhere you turn there's someone new to meet!  I've been there more times than I can count and I've never had a bad night! If I want to be guaranteed a fabulous night of dancing I go to Gracie's!  The live bands are always great and I sometimes forget in my drunken haze that I'm listening to live music and not a recording, that's how good they are!   If you're female you will definitely have an easier time getting served at the packed bar, but while you wait you've got interesting people surrounding you to pass the time.  The lines are sometimes long, but it's worth the wait and the $10-$15 cover, which varies each night.  The bathrooms are clean and well lit and there aren't usually line ups.  My only complaint is the bouncers at the end of the night, who have been very rude and aggressive on several occasions. But the staff inside the bar are always friendly!  If you're looking for a place to go with friends and dance the night away, this is the place to be! As long as you're not opposed to some country music and some popular 80's/90's covers!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it's because the chicken fingers were $10 and drinks $7, but I left this place with a bitter taste.  The ambiance is nice, but the waitress is likely to forget you exist for 30 minutes, then ask you if you've gotten your food or drink for the 2nd time.   Next time I'm in Canada, I'll go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Average priced drinks. Younger crowd 19-23 y/o. Has a coat-check for $2. We went to see a band playing here from the East coast and that was enjoyable."}
{"text":"The $10 dollar fish and chips Wednesday special is great. Big portion of fresh fish in a homemade batter. Coleslaw that comes with it is awesome too, thick fresh cabbage."}
{"text":"I came here last week for the first time because my bro was doing a comedy show here.  Nice seating areas, mens bathrooms are in the back. The look nice, but smell horrid.  The drinks are like 7 bucks in the daytime..  Ask for wifi! :)"}
{"text":"In the 5 years I've been on Yelp, I've only rated 8 businesses 1 star. That's only 2.3% of my reviews. For the statisticians in the crowd, the distribution of my ratings are positively skewed. My point is that 97.7% of the time, I'm fairly satisfied with a business. However, if I could rate Grace O'Malley's with zero stars, I totally would.   My beefs with Gracie's: 1. Rude powertrippy bouncers.  2. $13 cover on a Friday night. WTF? It's an IRISH-ESQUE PUB. One should never pay a cover to eat nachos and drink beer. 3. Rude bouncers.  4. Mediocre drinks. I ordered a hot chocolate with Bailey's (hey, it was a cold night.). Not only was the drink weak, but the sugar on the rim was anchored with LIME. Hot chocolate + lime sugar? *hork* 5. Bad cover band. Maybe it's 'cause I'm from the States, but I moved to Canada to avoid hearing songs like \"Sweet Home Alabama.\"  6. POWERTRIPPY BOUNCERS. I don't know what's with these guys, and maybe they're dicks because they have to deal with clientele who are drunk dicks, but... sheesh.   If there's one thing about Grace O'Malley's that deserves kudos, it's their waitresses. They try hard, are really nice, and are on top of their game.   Other than that, though... AVOID. FLEE WHEN POSSIBLE."}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite Irish Pubs in Toronto. We recently went in for lunch & we were surprised that our regular portions of food were about 1/2 the amount while remaining at the same price. While the food was still good, we were very disappointed in the significant decrease in portion size. We found out that it is now under new ownership and they are trying to make it more \"High Class.\"   Needless to say - we are very displeased with the new changes and won't be back. Regulars beware - this is not the old Grace you're used to."}
{"text":"Ok so I walk in the bar on monday at round 7pm...it's empty like 6 people I ask the bartender if they are showing the raptor game since the leas are not playing...he tells me we never show it..so ur going to show football over a Toronto team?..yes...can u turn ONE tv to raptors..no..so obviously the spot to hang out after work from ACC is not this place on a Monday as they have set rules against the Toronto raptors..so I will now only go to bars that do not remind of the 1960's in the southern part of the USA. So no ten cent wing for the demographic that watches raptors games...but the Toronto wing company saved the day ..grace deserves no stars but I have to give one"}
{"text":"I came here for wings on Monday April 13 around 8:30 p.m.   This was the WORST resturaunt experience in my ENTIRE life. The reasons for this are:  1) The $3 lb of wings seems really appealing. Too bad it is EXTREMELY misleading. They give you 5 TINY wings and force you to order an (overpriced) drink with it. If you want to order another lb, you have to order ANOTHER drink. Your $3 lb turns into $18.  *Important to note: NO FREE REFILLS when a soft drink is $4. Ridiculous, right?   2) HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!! I had to go up FIVE seperate times to the bar. The first time was to ask where our waitress was. The second was for napkins. Third was for the menu since their wing promotion was VERY disappointing. Fourth was for water. Fifth was to get our bill.   *Note- you would think the waitress would come to your table since you asked for a menu which means you were contemplating ordering more food. Stupid.  *She also did not ask how anything was.   3) They charge you an extra DOLLAR for dipping sauce.... when it should come with one. There is also no carrots or celery.   4) Our server was too busy flirting with old men to give proper customer service.    There were only two or three servers so Manager if your reading this you should probably try to go through your chits and see who ordered 2 lbs of BBQ wings, 1 Diet Coke and 1 Sprite, and see who the server was. I don't know her name because she did not have the decencey to even introduce herself.  I will NEVER come to this bar again. Neither should anyone reading this."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain types of \"Irish\" themed pubs (it's hard to tell this is one until you walk in). Nor am I a fan of bars that attracts clientele like a) clubland douchebags, b) loud obnoxious sports fans, c) alcohol-fuelled college kids/frat boys, d) any combination of the three. Its downtown location means you can expect such a crowd to a mediocre grimy pub like Grace.  Likewise, its beer menu is disappointingly dismal, small and completely leaning towards a world tour of familiar big brand names at premium prices. You might as well drink out of a toilet. Then again, it's a corporate chain pub, what should I expect?. Any bar in Toronto that does not at least have Steam Whistle or Mill St. does not deserve to be a bar anywhere in Toronto.  The food.... let's just say I'd rather go to a supermarket and buy some Pinty's Pub&Grill frozen meals. Hey, Pinty's products are endorsed by the Homan curling rink... I can't go wrong with that!  And the service can be slow to nonexistent. It wasn't even that busy a weekend night and there was hardly anyone keeping check at our section. And if I have to work my butt off to get the bill, via heading to the bar and then getting shuffled by headless staff over which server to talk to, and then waiting another 15 minutes waiting for it to be produced, meanwhile in the drunken frustration contemplating pulling off a dine-and-dash while watching the Penguins get their ass kicked on their dinky TVs, well... congratulations. You have failed as a restaurant. Let me know when you make an appearance on that obnoxiously exaggerated TV show Bar Rescue.  I shouldn't have to undergo an expedition to resolve a tab or get more drinks. What, y'all don't want to be paid? Hey, that would be swell by me, as I sure won't be back here even this is the last remaining bar in downtown."}
{"text":"Typical pub like bar.  Happy hour drinks - wines, beers and some liquors are $4.  Luckily that's all we went for.  I wasn't particularly too impressed with anything - and looks like since it was half empty at around 7pm-ish, other people thought so as well.  Our server was really nice though - she was new and when we asked questions she at least went to find out the answer and came back to let us know is a pleasant way.  I think there are better options in the city to hang back with your friends and chill at happy hour.  There isn't too much happy about this place...lol"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a few pints and some spinach cheese dip before a game with my girlfriend.  It is surprisingly nice inside. A lot of dark wood, lots of televisions, nice banquettes, and a giant tree! The mens' bathroom are in the basement, which is a pain in the ass especially when under the influence of a few drinks as stairs can mean death.   The waitstaff is very nice and easy to talk to. They also have a lot of good tips on great local spots. Prices for pints of Guinness are typical and the spinach cheese dip was pretty good. A little zesty, slightly spicy, and not too cheesy, it is one of the better spinach cheese dips I've had but be careful as it is damn hot! The waitress warned us about the temperature but I'm stubborn and was hungry so I dived right in, maybe next time I will listen to her... maybe. What I liked about the dip was that we were given to choice of whether to have it with all pita bread, all nacho chips, or half and half. I love toasted and seasoned pita bread so it was an easy choice for me.  Overall, it is a good place to have a few pints and some bar food. They have daily food specials, Mondays are 10cent wings, as advertised on every wall, if you are up for some cheap food I would think Monday is the day to go. I would come back here again but nothing about this place really sticks out in my had as being better than any other Irish pub."}
{"text":"Holy box bar batman.  I think it was picked up at ikea.  they've obviously lost the little Allan key needed to install the personality to this generic brestaurant.  Move on good sirs and madames."}
{"text":"It's a nice space, but the crowd was elder people... I ordered the steak pie, it tasted average...  jf you need somewhere quite and you want to drink beer, then this is the place."}
{"text":"We went early so we didn't get dinged with a covercharge. We had vegetarian nachos which i always feel is the safest pub food to order.   The serving was huge and the nachos were ok, the salsa was too bland even with the extra hot sauce. More importantly the company I was with was great and the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Out of the gate, I'll tell you that this is a place that I want to love.  I try to, God love me, I do.  But it's hard.  This should be sanctuary for me, a haven, a place to call my own.  But sadly it's got me thinking that this is the year I call Rogers Cable.  Confused?  More explanation, then.  Being an Ottawa Senators fan in Toronto provides not only hours of abuse at the hands of Leafs Nation (a separate country I wish existed so that exile orders could be drafted for many), but there's no place in town to watch games.  Well, there wasn't until Gracie showed up on the map.  Grace O'Malley's is an extension of the chain that began in Ottawa and extended its reach into the 416 from the 613.  It's another short skirt pub with Irish-y themes, good taps, and truly friendly staff, some from Ottawa that can commiserate easily.  And they show the Sens games.  You'd think it'd be a slam dunk, but it's not really.  The food is fair to middling at best despite the best efforts of the staff.  The beers are slightly on the pricey side for what's on offer.  The TVs, though plentiful, will show the Senators in whatever match they're in.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that we're in Toronto.  That means the projection TV at the front and the entire sound system in the bar is infected with the Leafs game.  No two sections in this place cheer at the same time.  Unless someone scores against the Leafs.  It's a good enough place I suppose, but when my fellow ex-pats try to talk me into going to Gracie's, I still find myself trying to figure out the math that will allow me to get the NHL package at home.  Gracey, why can't I love you?"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick Pint of Guinness. Sat at the bar, got the pint. Overall, this place is great for one reason alone. Senators games. This place is one of the only places you can find the sens game on a Saturday night. In a city that bleeds blue, it is hard to find a place showing my home town sens. Most of the time, I find myself cheering at my TV at home, but O'malley's gives me a nice alternative to that. They have good sports viewing, and lots of tables."}
{"text":"I'll give this two stars just because I know some people would dig this place.   I've been to \"Gracies\" a few times, and every time it just keeps getting worse and worse... maybe I'm just getting older and older. Fack! Anyhow - somehow got dragged into going to Grace O'Malley's after a few too many drinks and knew the second I got there it was a giant mistake.   Here were the main problems..  1. 9 dollars cover. WHAT?  2. Everyone appeared to be under 21. I'm no hater, but I just wasn't feeling being a cougar. 3. It just sucked.   Bottom Line: If frat boys are your thing, then I would recommend this bar."}
{"text":"One of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants is a lack of effort on the chef's part; like, they're having a bad night or whatever and they decide to just phone it in and deliver a truly subpar meal. So when I receive a dish that looks like some (or a lot) of effort was put into it, I can't help but take notice.  I wasn't expecting much from Grace O'Malley's given the less-than-glowing reviews here, and also it's a pub; nobody expects much from a pub.  Color me surprised, then, to have received what was one of the best meals I'd had in a while. I decided to order the Guinness Steak Pie, which I can't describe since it's not listed on the website. Anyway, the pie is accompanied by a generous serving of mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables (and a small jug of gravy).  First of all, the presentation was spot on. This was not a hastily assembled plate, clearly. And everything was prepared surprisingly well; the steak pie was piping hot and boasted a flaky pastry, the mashed potatoes contained little chunks of potato (which I love), and the veggies were cooked perfectly (ie they were neither too hard nor too soggy). The gravy was quite tasty, too.  All that plus $4 Happy-Hour pints? I'm in love."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night out, so I honestly have no idea about the food. First of all there was a massive line outside (I guess that means it should be good right?). Wrong, when you finally get past the bouncer and into the bar (after paying $14 cover, what!?), you are assaulted by the emanating body heat and sweaty odour. Which I guess, makes it no different than any other crowded bar. The drinks were meh and there is no real dance floor. On the other hand, the live band playing was fantastic, playing classics like Crocodile Rock and Living on a Prayer with reckless abandon. I would rather spend my $14 plus drink money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Meh...  This place is to bars what Ke$ha is to singing. It leaves you a feeling violated and cheap.  The beers = unimaginative The cocktails = revolting bar mix The food = microwaved   There's no real reason to go here ... ever. Take 10 steps in any direction and go to any one of the other bars nearby. Hell, even sharing a bottle with a hobo would be better than this."}
{"text":"Good vibe. Most of the staff was not helpful and extremely cold. But, shout out to Anthony for being super amazing ! will definitely be back because of him! super humble and nice!"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm being generous. We just went in to grab a quick drink. Firstly, it took a long time to get the server over to get our order. Like 10 minutes. It wasn't that busy. Then my friend asked for a red ale and the waitress said they didn't have any. Thought that was weird and she left and I grabbed the menu, sure enough a red ale. Called her back when we found her and she said bartender already poured the other draft. We said ok. Beer was ok.   She brought the check quickly when we signaled so that's good.  Group of us consensus is 2 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why, but every time I hang out with business students I end up going somewhere that reminds me of a frat house. Between this place and \"The Maddy\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz/madison-avenue-pub-and-restaurant-toronto), I just get the sleazy feel of desperation that is college guys trying to hit it and quit it. There's a reason why I stopped going to frats after my first few months of university.   And if it weren't enough, you need to pay to get into this sweaty, crowded, obnoxiously loud imitation frat house. Whatever happen to the good old days when you just had to pull your dress a little shorter or your top a little lower? If I don't want to get into a frat for free, why the hell would I want to pay to get into a fake frat?  The cherry on top is the sprinkling of creepy old guys who are sulking on the sides, drinking beers and watching college girls get rowdy. Play on, players."}
{"text":"Fun spot to go to before a Jays game, or casual drinks with friends. Food portions are big! We shared a chicken sandwich, poutine and nachos and it didn't all get eaten. Drinks specials are great!"}
{"text":"I have been in many different bars and and this is far the worst one I have been to. I ordered a beef steak pie that was supposed to be very good; it tasted like frozen pie I could have bought at any supermarket. The salad wasn't fresh and the nachos came w/o guacamole. The hamburger was dry."}
{"text":"Last night I was at Grace O'Malley's in downtown Toronto. While on my way to the bathroom, I got accosted by two huge bouncers who said they needed to talk to me. I'd just gotten there from the Ballroom, so when they asked me where my friends were, I accidentally said \"upstairs\" - I was a bit freaked out at the time, so I forgot we'd moved. I was informed there was no upstairs and that I should go home, since I was clearly lying. When I asked why I'd been removed and couldn't get back in, I was told it was because I didn't \"have boobs.\" With no way to contact my friends outside, I had to leave my phone and laptop bag there, since they wouldn't let me retrieve them. I had to just go home and email everybody and tell them to hold on to my phone and laptop so I could get them at work tomorrow."}
{"text":"At first I gave this place an average review.. Most of it is still valid.. Great band and atmosphere with little ventilation.  The security staff  needs some work.  The kicked the bachelor out of his bachelor  party  because he was having too much fun and the when 2 completely sober friends tried to ask why one of them was pushed down a flight of stairs by a bouncer.  Unacceptable by the security staff lead to our bachelor party to take our business  elsewhere.  There loss but businesses like this don't deserve a good reputation.  I hope I see the day this place goes out of business"}
{"text":"I had supper this evening at Grace O'Malley's.  I ordered wings with lemon pepper.  They were tasty but overcooked ... they were a bit dry.  I was still hungry so ordered garlic cheese bread.  It was good but I wasn't as hungry as I thought so just had a couple pieces.  Andrea was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"When I first tried the chicken fingers here (back in 2010 - before starting this Yelp account) I was very satisfied. However, I revisited this place for fingers very recently and was...very unimpressed. The fingers are decent and simply overpriced for the quality that you are receiving. If you are a fan of the fingers at Boston Pizza or Kelsey's then I guess you might enjoy the fingers here, but to me they are very typical, blah and semi-crispy tasting chicken fingers. I probably wouldn't order these fingers again unless I was completely hammered and craving a quick snack that I can split with a few friends. On a positive note, the fries are fantastic! Crispy and salty - but not overly salty.  All in all, the live music and overall vibe in this place definitely makes up for the not so splendid tasting chicken fingers.

{"text":"I was in town for a work trip. I was by myself because I had to catch a bus to buffalo. I was a little nervous to be out by myself in a city I was not familiar with. I walked right into Grace O'Malley's and felt very comfortable. The staff was all hanging out and VERY welcoming.  My waiter even asked what my name was (where does that ever happen? not New York). He made me feel more comfortable sitting by myself. When I had to go to the bus, which was on Bay Street, he insisted on calling a cab for me. On top of this the food is very good. When I come back 2 Toronto it'll be the first place I'll visit!"}
{"text":"There is no menu for drinks.... And really slow and expensive... Do not order any food items"}
{"text":"My hate for Grace O'Malley's is a source of amusement for all my friends. From the frat boy clientele to the over-crowding to the absurd lack of seating, Gracie's never fails to make me miserable. Wanna hear that Ja Rule song from 2005 that you didn't even like the first time around? This is the place.  It's been said before but COVER for a BAR is bloody ridiculous. It boils my blood so I try to avoid paying it at all costs. Which brings me to the last time I was forced to visit Graces....   My best friend, for inexplicable reasons, loves Graces. I think it's because she has a thing for Irish boys with preppy style (which this place is always full of). Regardless, she was moving to Austrailia for 2 years and wanted her send-off to be here. Since I knew they didn't charge cover before 9, I figured I'd show up at 8 and avoid that stupidness. When I get there, the bouncers inform me that there is a private party until 9. So, not only do I have to find something else to do for an hour, I HAVE to pay cover. I called my friends who I am supposed to be meeting, and learned they are already inside. WHAT?? I tried to reason with the bouncer that if my friends are inside, how \"private\" can the party be? This was to no avail. I was forced to drink cheap drinks at Croc Rock until 9 then return and pay $10 cover. Arrrrrrrgh. The rage is returning as I write this.....   The only good thing about my bestie being half-way around the world is that I never have to visit this place again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice: once on a Thursday and once on a Friday. And it was fantastic each time. After about 11pm, it gets ridiculously busy, so if you aren't a crowd person and dislike people rubbing up against you, I suggest otherwise. However, the music has been AWESOME both times (good rock music -- always crowd pleasers) and it has been live both times. Personally, music is pretty much key for me. Alcohol is expensive-- but it is most places down town."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Service was horrific. Here for two hours and literally writing this in the booth airing to try and pay. Only got served one beer in the full two hours and never had a chance to get another. Forced gratuity of 18% because we had 7 people and terrible service is a joke..."}
{"text":"It would be 4 stars if it were not for the stupid cover BUT the crowd here was much better than anywhere else in the area.  We came up here from NY, and although I am not on the market for any women, the other places near-by like the Crocodile Rock had so many guys in it we immediately left thinking it was a gay bar.    We went to Grace O'Malley's 2x, once on fri night and once on Thursday to eat.  The food was ok, but as other reviewers said, overpriced.  Bartenders/servers were very nice and we had a real Irish waitress.    At night on Friday, there were probably 3 girls for every guy there, which was probably the first time we saw a lot of girls out in Toronto at all.  $13 cover was wack, and just cause you are playing music does not mean you get to charge a cover.  However the place was pretty busy and had a good crowd so I guess it is supply and demand"}
{"text":"Saw a promotion for $2 pound of wings today and decided to feed my craving. Sizeable meaty and saucy Teriyaki wings with a Richards White came up to $9 which aint bad if you don't mind standard flavour with not a ton of zing. Still a nice solo Indulge Mondays after 5pm. Under the tree at the bar is a nice nook to read my newspaper. One projector to my left but a column in the way, TVs in odd places but bet a game at 7pm could pack this joint and get even louder than it is. Washrooms are fine, staff dont hound you. (Probably smells like piss during club weekends I'm guessing but not today)"}
{"text":"The bouncers are the rudest people i have ever met! And honestly completely racist. The bouncer wanted extra money to let us a crowd of brown people in! I left last night so upset because they wouldn't let us back in after a smoke break. Made St. Patty a sour memory. Should have stuck to fionn maccools!"}
{"text":"nothing special...just normal pub food with drinks jack daniels was promoting the \"honey\" version of the whiskey...which was gross"}
