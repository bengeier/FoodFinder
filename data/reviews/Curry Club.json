{"text":"Seeing the open board I went in to see empty vessels without food :( the website was great and seeing it, I was bugging my husband to take me there.. It disappointed both and we went back hungry searching for another restaurant...
Maybe they should remove the open board if food is over... Or if you want to try go early..."}
{"text":"Dude you suck big time... We came to your restaurant at 2pm and there was no food in the buffet even though you close at 2.30pm... And when asked the young female about bringing fresh and more food.. The response was no more food and kitchen was closed and the cook left the place ... Fantastic!!!!..  Please remove those big words from your website about your passion for cooking and food when you can't meet the basic needs of providing fresh and quality food during your operation hours .. Adios buddy ..."}
{"text":"Great Indian Buffett in the NE that's about the closest to the NW with consistent quality and taste.
The only thing is it's packed and seating is limited."}
{"text":"The items were plentiful and packed with flavour.  We went here for the lunch buffet and at just over $13 it wasn't a bad deal.  The buffet included a small salad bar and a couple dessert items.

The server was quite nice and always smiling.  I'll be back here again!

I forgot to mention that the air quality in here is quite good especially for an Indian restaurant.  I didn't walk out smelling like curry and it didn't linger into my clothes, as like most Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"The items were fresh and delicious. My coworker and I were both impressed with this small, unassuming restaurant. We got a basket of fresh naan with our $12.99 buffet. Good mixture of veggie and meat items. Clean and polite staff."}
