{"text":"The pizza is very good...great crust and sauce. It takes a while for orders to be made so definitely call ahead."}
{"text":"There are so many pizza places in Brunswick. However, we order from here regularly. The pizza is in my top 5. Salads are excellent. Wings are very tasty.  One negative thing that I did notice when I went to pick up my order was the young gal who took care of me was preparing to make a pizza, she left the prep area, came to register and cashed me out, said have a nice night, then went back to add toppings to the pizza. That is all fine, but she never washed her hands in between handling money and going back to the pizza. It takes 30 seconds to wash! I will likely go back, and recommend the great pizza to others. But will be looking to see if they wash up."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been getting their pizza,salads and boneless wings for several months now. I really love this food. I can tell the dough is homemade, the cheese and other toppings are of excellent quality (they actually use real chicken on their pizzas). The quality of their ingredients is excellent and their prices remain competitive and reasonable.  I have recommended his pizza to my friends and hope this place has a long future in Brunswick."}
