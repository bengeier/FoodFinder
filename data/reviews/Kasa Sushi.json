{"text":"The sushi tastes great, but I have multiple complaints: I ordered in advance and arrived shortly after my pick-up time.  I sat and waited for my food and was ignored (it was Valentine's Day, they were busy.  But it's Valentine's Day - everything is busy! Plan ahead!) There was one cashier and she was the waitress as well. There were multiple tables and only one of her with tons of people calling for take out. I saw two tables come in, take a seat, be ignored, and leave. I watched 5 different parties of people arrive AFTER me, look at the menu, place a takeout order, GET THEIR FOOD AND LEAVE and I had still not even been acknowledged!! I ordered $27 dollars worth of sushi, which is supposed to be like a buy 3, get one free deal. I didn't receive my free roll, and with the cost of their rolls, the extra is something that you rely on to make it worth spending $27 on three rolls. The pieces of fish in the rolls were SO slack. All of my rolls were mostly tempura bits and cucumber, with a barely noticeable piece of fish.  I sat there and waited for 45 minutes, silently and with no grimace on my face because I understand customer service when you're short staffed is shitty enough.  When my food was finally done, I was not apologized to for the wait. They knew how long I was there, because I was sitting right in front of the cash. The extra roll should have been a given at this point. I heard the girl give another couple free miso soup because he placed his order and then wanted to CHANGE his order retroactively and it was already made - so it was too late.  So these guys get extra soup for being indecisive and I sit here for 45 minutes and get sparse sushi, nothing complimentary and had ordered in advance of all of these other people, and left long after them.  And if I hadn't been assertive about my beverage, I would have left without that, too. Seems like they're cutting corners in many ways and not giving the service to make up for it. :/ Shame, because I live nearby and now I'm going to go out of my way to get sushi from elsewhere. The chefs are really good, so it's a sin that they're not allowed to put a decent chunk of fish in a roll that's essentially over $10 dollars after tax."}
{"text":"Kasa is one of the best, if not the best sushi I have ever had. I would put this up against any high end place in terms of quality, freshness amd overall taste.  I usually get it to take out, but there is some seating room inside.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Delightful place ! Well we were out for a night and we had wanted post drinks food. So we walked and found this legit sushi place !   I can't say how amazing the food was. Being a vegan you might think I had any choices. So wrong !!! So we ordered the dinner for 2 which came with soup and so many sushi rolls !!! For $26 dollars total we split the bill for $13 person plus tip. The tea and water was free.   I loved the soup it was flavourful and a great size. Then I proceeded to eat 10 or so vegan sushi rolls. The service was very fast. I loved the seating and atmosphere.   Parking on the street is doable but it depends what time you go. As well they accept all forms of payment. They close a bit early but it's worth checking out it !"}
{"text":"The best adventure a yelper can have is stumbling into a restaurant that is the only one open on the block at 8 pm. A small but super cute place. We were greeted by the friendly staff. I think this was the first time we ordered sushi so quickly. 5 of us got the combo for 72$. This combo included a a Asian salad which we asked to swap for extra pieces of sushi. It was a hefty meal- and each one of us got at least more than 10 pieces. When the bill came out to 16$ each with tax- I was ecstatic because sushi can get expensive very quickly.   I find it odd they don't serve edamame, a standard dish you would find at most sushi restaurants - but makes this one unique!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi. Kasa was already more expensive than other local sushi shops but absolutely worth it for the quality. Recent across-the-menu price hikes were too aggressive in my opinion (my $35 order jumped to $49 for exactly the same items)."}
{"text":"Came here after the place we intended to go was closed on a Monday. The menu is HUGE! I didn't have quite enough time to look at it so I went with my standard dishes - spicy tuna and shrimp tempura. The pieces of fish/shrimp were way too small in my opinion, and the spicy tuna was not very spicy (but I find this to be true everywhere I go in Montreal). Otherwise, service was fine and they accommodated our large group at the end of the night."}
{"text":"Came here after the Yelp Badge event.   We were a group of 8 and the staff was able to accommodate us. Service was good. No wifi. The seating was good, we just put two tables together and we could all sit together comfortably.   I only ordered my favourite Philadelphia cheese, salmon, avocado rolls and it was 10$ taxes and tip in for 8 pieces.   They were pretty good! It is kinda hard to mess those up though. They were very generous with the avocado, the pieces were huge!"}
{"text":"On a pris un plateau 44 morceaux. C'était bon mais rien de nouveau, rien d'original. Et il n'y avait que des gros futomakis, pas de sushis, pas de sashimis, pas d'hosomakis... un peu trop lourd à mon goût  Bref pas transcendant, ok si on passe à côté mais de la à faire le détour (ou à recommander en livraison)... non"}
{"text":"Presentation of food was very nice. A small miscommunication due to our lack of french-skills but good food."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi at a reasonable price. We had a shared \"table d'hote\" for 5 and my bill came out to about $14 + tax+ tip. Comfortable seating. Good Variety of sushi.  Would have appreciated more ginger and service was poor. I didn't even get a cup to drink. Anyways, I came here for sushi and I got sushi. Plenty of snow outside to stay hydrated I guess."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs restaurant de sushis en ville et ils livrent en plus! :)) Toujours frais et délicieux. On adore!"}
{"text":"Yummy, mais service ô combien lent. Belle ambiance par contre pour une place a sushi qui ont souvent une déco de Noël à l'année."}
{"text":"Finally found an affordable place to get good sushi. I was very happy to discover this place thanks to a friend who wanted to try it out. Good service and prices. You should definitely try the house's original creations as they definitely know what they are doing. There was something i tried (looked like a sandwhich) but i foegot the name so I  guess we can call it a sushi sandwhich? Hmm yes, try that. Awesome."}
