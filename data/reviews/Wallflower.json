{"text":"Super disappointed after reading such rave reviews. The food was so salty for both of our dishes; the noodle dish I ordered was $14, and tasted like a drunken 3am fast-food  binge. You could say the prices were reasonable, but there is something to be said for \"cheap and cheerful\". The Wallflower wasn't really either; it didn't measure up at all compared to other spots in the area, like 3-Speed, Drift, and Bar Neon, where the food is great and the staff make you feel happy to be out on the town.

It's true: the creative cozy, warm, nostalgic decor will instantly win your heart - but I would probably only come for drinks next time. I say \"C'mon Wallflower! Pull up your socks! We need you!\""}
{"text":"This place is unassuming & comfortable. Not annoyingly hip, & not repetitively dull.

It's definitely one of those weird sorts of crushes that I developed with Wallflower after \"being involved\" with it's location on bloor (3 Speed), I came here to compare...like when you date someone for a while and then develop mad hots for their best buddy; a \"Jessie's Girl\" type of sitch.

...it was a lovely environment. 

While still perfectly encapsulating the great comfort & feel of an evening during which you go over to your old buddy's house for some chip n dip and beers, this place makes you feel like your buddy has just returned from a glorious trip to Europe, and has just become way more cool and interesting, and is now serving you oysters and craft beers. 

It's romantic, but doesn't come on too strong. 

It can also be platonic, but not too bro-ish or friend zone-ish. 

And if you go by yourself, you may spend (unknowingly) the greatest 4 hours or more of your life in a cozy dim lit corner with a good read, or with your conscious, or just people watch, & fall in love with hanging out by yourself in a wicked new way.

It is one of the most beautiful resto/bars in the city! While most bars try really hard to recreated a bohemian and chill and dark feel, this bar just doesn't try at all but the atmosphere simply speaks for itself and creates a fun aura. It's very fun there! The tunes are groovy.

Drinks and finger foods are reasonable, and it has a adorably wicked back room too! I think you should most def try it out."}
{"text":"Had such a satisfying experience at Wallflower with two friends at a cozy corner table by the window. 4 1/2 hrs we were there with wine and food getting the best service from chill,  friendly staff. Food was great from a compact kitchen. One quaint detail....they don't serve hot drinks ( no coffee or tea). Not a deal breaker.... next time I'm going to make sure we sit on the back patio. Oh....best wallpaper ever (by the bar)"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. It's my go to when meeting with friends or dates as it's casual but intimate. Friendly staff, good lighting, affordable eats, and there's a sweet patio when it's not winter."}
{"text":"Came here for a pre dinner snack, but the menu wasn't extensive or too great when it came out.  The service was mediocre given we were the only ones there"}
{"text":"Had the pork burger, was good. Came with wedges and slaw. The pork patty was a bit too salty, but otherwise it was good. The slaw was called 'kale' slaw but not much kale came with it."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and we were quite disappointed with the food. The caesar salad was so awful, the gnocchi dish was just horrible.  The beer was overpriced, however the environment and space was pretty sweet and I would probably go back to drink but I would not recommend the food at all.  Disgusting food!"}
{"text":"Gotta love the local watering hole for residents of Parkdale along Dundas. 

Came here for drinks this evening an much like my CM pals from near and far I fell in love with this tiny dive bar spot. 

You enter into a small bar room but little do you know, much like Alice's rabbit hole, the Wallflower goes deeper and deeper (and becomes more and more curious). Walking down and then up a few steps you're welcomed into what looks like the main room area with the walls adorned with mustached portraits - (lets call this the dictator room). While I didn't sit here you can tell this space can hold a fair number of people. 

The fun didn't end here however, walks g down a full flight of stairs between the two rooms, leads you to the bathroom and those in the know, know to walk up a far flight of stirs which leads them to the cutest most unknown Neighbourhood patio I've ever seen. Built like a deck at your best friends house, the Christmas lights providing visibility mixed with the high wooden walls make this a come little spot. Pro-tip it closes at 10pm on most weekdays.

Aside from the lack of name above the door what I really enjoyed here was their unique take on a Pimms cup; made with Pimms No. 1 and bourbon! Yumm. Filled with ice, cucumbers and an orange slice it was refreshing and boozy enough to make you woozy! Hooray! And for $9 taxes in, I'd say that's a better than fair price for a great cocktail like this. 

Great quiet place to grab a drink, and while I didn't have anything to eat here, the food looked pretty damn good to. 

Stop in for day time drinks on this patio, its amazing!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful interior, with such a cozy feel! As you walk further and further into the bar it feels like it keeps going forever! And the atmosphere seems to change as you keep getting further into the bar. The service was very nice and friendly, and very relaxed. I'd recommend coming when u are not in a rush and want to have a nice of relaxing and catchups w old friends. It's quite dark and intimate as an atmosphere so it's perfect for intimate conversations and venting sessions. They had a decent selection of beers on tap and made a mean gin and tonic! Prices were very fair for their specialty drinks and pints . It's  definitely my favourite bar in parkdale to date in my book. I look forward to checking it out again especially in late spring/summer to lounge on the infamous patio I keep hearing/ reading about!"}
{"text":"Found it on BlogTOs best new bars of 2012. It's not even on yelp! Yet!!! Jordan and I wanted to go for a Sunday night drink and we decided on Wallflower. It's so close to our house, just west of Brock on Dundas. A sandwich board let us know they were open. 
Upon walking in I immediately loved it. Lots of stained glass windows, high ceilings, vintage flower wallpaper, and a bar lit with strung Christmas lights. So cute and quaint. Perfect date spot. Just one bartender tonight, she brought us our menus right away. There were three other couples in the bar and one person at the wood. The wine list was written on a piece of cardboard which I thought was fun. There were two Malbecs on the list so I was sold. Jordan had a No. 9 on tap. We decided to indulge in their $2 oysters. We had two dozen. Cute little spot. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has nice ambiance and really good prices.  The food is decent--nothing that's blown me away, and unfortunately a couple of dishes I'm not really fond of, but I'll keep coming back every once in a while to try something new on the menu, because it's still a nice night out."}
{"text":"Wallflower is a beautiful, candle-lit space that is just oozing with atmosphere.

I have no clue how this establishment manages to stay so calm with all of its charm (compared to its sister-location, Three Speed), but I've never found it obnoxiously noisy or crowded. 

It's a perfect place for dinner, the specials are always interesting and reasonably priced, and there are vegetarian and vegan offerings (although not many).

Our group really enjoyed it when our server prepared a special cocktail for us that she had invented! There's also a good beer selection and a reasonably good wine selection.

The vibe is comfortable and social without being noisy and raucous. I will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Such a chill place to chill, and you don't have to choose between the cocktail bar vibe and the actually-good-food vibe.

Changing menus make me nervous but this one was lovely, varied, and so reasonably priced. I had salmon with quinoa and a deviled egg (WHY DON'T MORE PLACES HAVE DEVILED EGGS?!) while others at my table enjoyed everything from poke to gnocchi to chicken. We hung out on the patio til we were good and ready to go - no rush. Can't wait to get the goddamn winter out of the way so I can go back."}
{"text":"Nice small, intimate and rustic atmosphere. We went on a cold Saturday night at close to after midnight in March. Service was friendly but definitely a place for drinks and not food.

Potato Wedges - They're undercooked.
Devised Eggs - Not a fan of my Eggs being cold but if you are, you might love this!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem! While the Dundas West area is more bar-populated closer to Ossington, this ambient bar at Dundas and Dufferin was a great spot. Some interesting craft brews/ciders on tap, nachos were very small unfortunately but food menu looked good overall. Interesting crowd of people, your typical mid-aged hipsters"}
{"text":"I went to this place on a date and it was absolutely perfect. Cozy, great ambience, relaxed and intimate, with great decorative touches that kept us continually saying \"oh look at that!\" It was like a 3D pinterest board, but not obnoxiously so. Great small plates for sharing, a good and reasonably priced wine list, attentive service....a gem!"}
{"text":"We really loved it here. Aside from an initial awkward experience, we had a great time overall. We entered the lounge and we're not greeted, however we were stared at by the bartender and we kept looking back waiting for service of any sort. A nice couple offered us their table which was extremely nice, but not necessary and should've been taken care of by the staff and not the guests. Once we did get service, however, our night was really looking up. Our server was a really pleasant and relaxed young lady who gave us cute hand made menus which go with the overall cozy decor of the place. They had plenty of craft beer on tap and several more in can/bottle and they ranged at about $6~$8. We also got snack size nachos with pulled pork and hot peppers for only $10 and they were delicious. Also one of the best Ceasars around, tasted like a nice salad ;) makes me feel like I'm drinking healthy LOL.

Overall, very nice and cozy!! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything about Wallflower warrants a return--the adorable, dim lit decor, the awesome staff, the delicious food and drinks (reasonably priced). Ask for the \"cash out\" cocktail."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to go for a cute date night. Was here again this past Saturday for apps and drinks with friends, as always, had a lovely time. 

There's a few reasons why I'm so fond of this place, the atmosphere- dim lit, unpretentious, quaint, casual, just go and see it for yourself (or don't- its my hidden gem). The food- they always have a wide variety of features which allows for trying different dishes every time you visit. Oysters- if you're an Oyster lover such as myself, they always have $2 oysters, which is great! Lastly, they have spirit tree cider on tap! And that's a win in my books :)"}
{"text":"Quaint little back patio, and the food is okay as well (pulled pork is actually quite tasty). But the service was dismal despite being practically empty, and I'm really not a fan of their 15oz beer mugs regardless of how good their craft beer selection is. I'm getting used to places serving 16oz pints, but these mugs seemed especially small.

Goods minus the bad and here we are, 3 stars for Wallflower."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place with a secret patio. 

I had the Mussels - good solid 7/10. 

My dining partner had the Chicken Taco and it both looked tasty and disappeared fast."}
{"text":"Wallflower is a neighbourhood gem. If you're in the area and have some time to grab a drink or have a bite, then I definitely recommend making a pit stop at this lovely bar. 

The service is always great! The staff is incredibly helpful and very outgoing. 

This place is amazing for drinks. Let's just say, it's very refreshing to go here after seeing the absurd pricing Queen and Dundas West have to offer.

I'm the biggest fan of their grilled cheese plate. It's so so so yummy! Yes, I know that grilled cheese is something you can easily make at home but I assure you that this is the best grilled cheese I've ever had and it's only seven bucks! Like, WHAT?! This wonderful plate comes with potato wedges and kale slaw. My go-to snacks are usually that and their devilled eggs. You can not go wrong with either. Just a heads-up; my partner usually orders from their list of specials and has said that sometimes it can be a hit or miss.

They have a stunning outdoor patio that you can enjoy during the summertime. However, once it starts getting chilly out, you'll definitely feel cozy inside with their super charming decor. 

Try it out!"}
{"text":"To the Romantics, welcome home. To the romantically challenged, welcome to a spot that's gonna give you new kinds of feelings you last had when you experienced awkward sensations for your grade school friend's mom. Wallflower is a romantic wonder that'll stir up something real nice. Like dinner. Or a liquid dinner of cocktails til you can't remember your date's name. The perfect date spot so much so, that if you don't make it to date two, well, it was all you. Back to being a wallflower. How ironic."}
{"text":"I love the Wallflower.

My dining companion used to live in the area, so we often found ourselves showing up for just a quick drink or even a full-fledged meal. The dark, inviting ambiance works for just about any scenario, and I will admit I've missed the place since my aforementioned friend moved away.
We decided to make our triumphant return a few nights ago and it was as though we'd never left. We even managed to secure our usual table near the door.

Before we even got there, we both knew that one thing we had to order was the deviled eggs. These are standard deviled eggs with an always-changing roster of toppings. (On this particular night, the eggs were topped with cumin and another spice I'm forgetting.) Though they're not prepared to order - these clearly came out of a fridge - the eggs are perfectly cooked and the center is deliciously creamy. A must.

I was also excited to order the Snack Nachos, as it's an item that pretty much became a staple for me during my many previous visits. It was saddening, then, to discover that the dish has grown considerably worse in the last few months (or perhaps the chef was having an off night). What was once an ooey, gooey mess of cheesy nachos has turned into a lazy, phoned-in dish that leaves way too many nachos without any cheese. (Nothing worse than a naked nacho, in my opinion.) I'll probably give this one another shot on a future visit, but I was definitely quite disappointed.

We also decided to try one of their specials, a Brisket Stew. Despite the fact that it was really more of a soup than a stew, we quite enjoyed this dish. It's got a deep, delicious flavor that's heightened by an assortment of tasty ingredients, including a very generous serving of soft, tender brisket and a good helping of bread (which is perfect for sopping up the rich sauce).

I should also point out that the service was, as always, excellent. I had a question about one of the beers on tap, and the waitress offered to bring me a small glass to try. Now that's what I call going above and beyond."}
{"text":"Good selection of craft beers for a reasonable price. Generally a good place to come for drinks.

Great ambiance and aesthetic.

Food is only ok (2 or 3 stars) but at least it is priced to reflect that. I ate here only once and next time will just stick to drinks."}
{"text":"Unfortunately didn't have a chance to eat here but the cocktails are incredible.  Very chill joint with amazing staff (especially anna)! Very welcoming and very easy to feel at home in. Great garden like patio"}
{"text":"A space that calls to toss your watches and sit all night: dim lights, long benches and pours, vinyl and Victorian fair. If I've met my match for just the place to sit alone together as two for six hours, this is it. It's infinitely moody, and from a fistful of eras. It's youthful, it's charming short bar in the front, it's heartwarming clam bake on the menu. Come here alone and read 1Q84 or come with your own St. Elmo's Fire set and chat about how much reality does not bite in this very instance you're in this place. I'm through the roof for Wallflower because I'm deeply affected by atmosphere and energy, and when I think of this place I feel boundless and rich with the fact that places like this remain."}
{"text":"Sweet, intimate, romatic ambiance.  Great for going out for drinks or an amazing dinner.  Food was delicious.  Tasted like an awesome home cooked meal.  Nice selection of specialty cocktails.  Service was perfect.  No complaints will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto, hands down. Great drinks, excellent menu, gorgeous interior with a vintage vibe. 

I highly recommend the jerk chickpea burger!"}
{"text":"Low-key, intimate spot with great vibes and a lot of character. Great date place with paneled ceilings, a beautiful bar and a quaint patio. The drinks are fairly-priced and the food is pretty good too. Opted for a jerk-inspired chicken dish, the chickpea burger and wasn't disappointed. Try to get here in the summer months and sneak a spot on the patio, definitely my highlight."}
{"text":"Just adore this spot. In an old house with lots of nooks and crannies. Lots of quirks and charm. Great outdoor space. So nice for a date or a night out with friends. Unique food and specials. Great wine and beer list! Better for a late night stop!"}
{"text":"Really like this place. Great beer, friendly staff, great vibes, and Toronto-reasonable prices. What else is there to say? Definitely a spot worth checking out if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"First of all, this is one of the most beautiful resto/bars in Toronto. It's just pretty, dammit. 
Off the bat we were impressed with the affordable wine selection ($33 and up per bottle, hey now!)  And, liking wings almost as much as I like Wings, I thoroughly enjoyed their jerk chicken variety, though the sauce was closer to a pesto. A nice fresh julienne salad on the side and lightly fried potatoes paired well. Chicken was a little undercooked on my friend's plate. I don't believe in diseases so do not find this a true concern. The cheesecake is *highly* recommended. Rezo's aren't really an option and big parties are not commended. 

Bon soir."}
{"text":"Toronto's back patios: friend and foe. Friend because duh, patio. Foe because it seems impossible to know where they all are, particularly in the hour of need. Yes, it is possible to absolutely need a cocktail on a patio on a hot day. I know because I checked. With myself. 

Many of Toronto's patios are hidden from sight to those just walking by, sometimes even hidden to those inside the restaurant. But oh man, learning a place you already love also has a patio is like getting a free garlic dip for your pizza: it makes a good thing even better. 

This was my experience with Wallflower. I have lived in the neighbourhood and visited a number of times over the years, but never knew it had a back patio. This is largely because the entrance to the patio requires you to go through the first room of the restaurant, down the stairs, past the bathroom, and back up the stairs out the back door. Not exactly intuitive. But definitely adds to the feeling like you are in on a special secret. 

The back patio is just as chilled out and comfortable as Wallflower's interior, and has a way of making you feel like you are completely separated from the noise of the city even though it is only a few steps away. Wallflower's selection of dishes, all of which fit into the category of what I would call comfort food - devilled eggs, gnocchi, and a simple green salad are my frequent selections - fit the outdoor setting just as well as the indoor one. Maybe don't order the potato wedges AND the gnocchi unless you want to roll yourself home/go into a potato starch related coma. Or maybe just plan a trip to a coffee shop post-meal since Wallflower doesn't have coffee on site."}
{"text":"This place is just so beautiful, and their menu changed so I'm updating my five star review... to another five star review. 

The clambake for two is no longer on the menu, which saddened me, but I guess it's autumn and it's time for a change. I really enjoyed their incredibly buttery and thick grilled cheese and seafood soup. My partner had their caesar salad and deviled eggs and they were delicious, too (I heavily poison-tested them. You can never be too careful.)

Their wine, beer and whiskey lists are all very long and luxurious, and my head hurts today because of it."}
