{"text":"We drove past the restaurant on the way to a different Indian buffet, but thought we should give it try. I had 2 kids with me who are somewhat picky eaters so when we saw pizza the kids were excited.  First we noticed there were no meat dishes so my son was disappointed (hoping to see butter chicken) and the pizza was too spicy for my other kid. For the price I paid for both kids was not worth it. They didn't eat enough to justify the price of the buffet for kids. Even though the spread of foods was larger than some buffets I've seen the selection wasn't that great. Some of the naan bread was not fresh (some tough and hard I had to pull with my teeth).  My son did enjoy the sweets, but most likely we won't go back here again for the very reason there was no meat."}
{"text":"My partner and I came in for the buffet just before the dinner rush on Saturday. I was initially a bit skeptical as I hadn't realized everything was 100% vegetarian, but I was very pleasantly surprised. A few things didn't seem fresh, but everything was delicious (and so spicy!). The desserts were my personal favourite. Both my partner and I loved the paneer and naan. The pizza was great too. For the price ($12?), the value is excellent. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Deep in the heart of Calgarystan lies a gateway to epic Indian food.  The locals have greedily kept it a secret from me..until now, muhaha!  Cheap ($10.99), diverse, and high quality, it does not get any better than this.    I'm a serious carnivore, but didn't feel short changed at all with the 100% vegetarian menu here: e.g. half a dozen seasoned rices, just as many bean curries, pakoras, paneer curry, samosas, various delicious potato and cauliflower preparations, pizza, milk dumplings, awesome caramel bananas, other sweets and if you must...fruit and salad :-D  Another great thing here is the naan, which is fresh and repeatedly handed out table side.  This is handy for mopping up and taming the flavourful and cumulatively spicy curry sauces.  Excuse me, I'm salivating as I reminisce."}
{"text":"What a disaster! I found a piece of plastic in my chole...when I told the staff, they respond by saying \"that's no big deal, these thing happen\"."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here and thought because its so cheap the decor and food might not be the greatest. ..but it was filthy...I just got the impression they don't care about the customer experience one bit! Food was ok but I definitely wouldn't go back because if its that filthy in the dining area what is it like in the kitchen? !"}
{"text":"Finally another veggie restaurant!!  I definitely agree that some of the buffet items are a bit on the old side. I've learned to avoid some of the fruits specifically. The mains however are really delicious and they're always willing to help accommodate a vegan diner.  Word to the wise though the buffet items can get spicy!"}
{"text":"I went last Saturday for Valentine dinner and what we got was uncooked fritters, pathetic curries that literally you can feel the raw taste of spices. They laid out the few dishes all round the serving area to look like they had more varieties. My cousin got a piece of hair in her dish. we went to complain to the owner manager who took a few of the uncooked fritters to taste and called the cook to give him a lecture. The manager t√≤ok our complaints lightly saying they werent expecting a huge crowd hence the small errors! Still we ended up paying full charge for the pathetic dishes we never ate. I will never go to this filthy, They also give preference to their own Punjabi's in service. I do not recommend this place to any vegetarian to spend his or her hard earned money."}
{"text":"My husband and I found Five Rivers about a year ago and decided to try it. We were happy to find a vegetarian Indian restaurant in Calgary. The restaurant is in an old Pizza Hut building. We assumed that is why they had pizza at the buffet.   The hot choices were limited but mostly tasty. Our favourite is the Shahi Paneer since you get some protein without all the carbs. Despite that, the Chana Masala and Dhal are good too. We loved it so much that we went often.  Sometime late spring, we decided to try and cut down on carbs, so we stopped going here every week. We hadn't been there for over 6 months so we were looking forward to it after so long.  Everything seemed normal as we drove up to the building and as we walked in, but that is where it stopped. The first thing we noticed was that the stack of plates was replaced with more traditional stainless steel indian plates and bowls which we liked.  Then we noticed that the buffet had been drastically cut back. The giant salad bar was gone. There were only 4 items left and the pizza was non-existent. We were glad to see that at least the paneer, dhal and chana were still there.  The food quality had gone down, sadly. The flavours had gone down too much to be enjoyable. The flavoured rice wasn't as good as it used to be and looked like it had been there since 6am.  While we were getting more paneer to try and justify the buffet, a man and his wife entered the restaurant. We heard him ask one of the employees \"Where is the rest of the food?\" the girl answered \"It's here.\"  motioning to the very small salad bar. To which he responded \"Where is the rest of it? It used to be much bigger?\" my husband interjected and said to him \"I asked the same question and got the same answer. No answer.\"  If the owners think that no one is going to notice when drastic changes are made to the buffet, they are kidding themselves.  My husband was particularly sad that there was no rice pudding.  We finished our blah food, felt very unsatisfied and disappointed that Five Rivers had gone \"up the river, without a paddle.\"  Sadly, we won't likely be going back.   :-("}
{"text":"I often order from Five Rivers because they have great items and great prices.  However, I find when I order through skipthedishes my orders are not paid attention to. I say this because I always leave a special comment on where it asks you to type what you want. The person receiving the orders is not paying attention?   Also, I always type  \" please add desi salad with cucumber, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, lemon,salt, and pepper and dhai(yogurt) or raita\". You can order everything on the skipthedishes except for that. Kindly please add these two items to the skipthefdish menu. Also, I order Milk Badam every time, but I never receive it?  I look forward to ordering again.  P.S- Also the serving size for the mango milkshake is always different. I just ordered and today I received only half a cup only ,and last time I ordered I received a full cup, and the time before that I received was a full cup... - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Changes to the review as of 12/30/2017 **:I changed the ratings because I noticed on skipadish.com they changed ALL of the prices by 50% ! Which is sad...I was picking this place for the food and price. Maybe there is a new owner now...because now they don't sell just vegetarian dishes they have meat dishes."}
{"text":"This is an all you can eat vegetarian Indian restaurant. Great value lots of selection but all vegetation dishes. I would say 3 1/2 stars but not a four star. Selection is good they also have pizza."}
{"text":"If you're driving from far away to come to this place, STOP! Turn around! There's plenty of other Indian restaurants to get food from that's far better. I'm sure you already know this but they don't serve meat. The food was ok, the rice had no flavor.  It actually ruined the other foods so I had to eat a plate without rice. They had pizza but I was sitting under a warmer that wasn't turned on so yes, the pizza was cold. I saw about 5 workers 3 of them were servers.  I saw one when they brought me water and that was it. My empty plates sat on my table until I left. A few people left when I got there and their plates sat on the table for about 20 mins until they went to clean it.   It may be a deal for the amount of food but I don't feel it's worth it. Everything was just bllahhhhh. Only reason I left this review is because I'm waiting for more bread and has nothing else to do..... where's the bread?"}
{"text":"We *love* this place!  It is a vegetarian Indian buffet, and hot damn a tasty one at that! It is one of those places a carnivore can gorge away happily and not miss meat one bit!   Their selection is awesome.. Naans, rice, chickpea dishes, peas dishes, daal, eggplant dishes, spinach dishes, cauliflower dishes, samosas, pakoras, appetizers, salads, fresh fruit, fresh veggies, gulaab jamun, jilebis, and other desserts.   SO. GOOD.  Oh did I mention the price? $10 for all that. No joke.  This is one of those restaurants I have never been able to leave without almost going into a (happy) food coma."}
{"text":"Nothing was good about this place. The people working had such a relaxed attitude that I don't even think we had a server? Not sure if this is intentional but oh well. Not a big deal. The variety was a little boring I found - rice...noodles...beans..more rice noodles and beans, some dried up potatoes, some dried up french fries...some pizza, some other dishes which would have been ok if the food was hot (it was warm at best...some dishes were even cold...that doesn't even meet food health and safety!). I don't know about this place. We were seated at some booth that looked like it would fall apart once we sat on it, the dishes were dirty at the buffet... So gross. I went there hungry, and I left starving and feel queasy! At least it was only 9.99$...."}
{"text":"A real treat for the vegetarian and friends. There is o prentense here of being anything other than a fully vegetarian reataurant.   Food is very good with a lot of variery. And you cannot beat the price for all-you-can eat. A large(14 inch) take out pizza is only $10 with unlimited toppings.  I would have given 5 stars due to the value but its not the cleanest restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends brought me here after I had a serious case of low carb, low sugar, low EVERYTHING after a long day of hiking.  This building looks like it used to be an old Pizza Hut and what did this little Indian Buffet do? Make pizza! When I looked a their menu they had your usual pizza staples like Mediterranean and Hawaiian, but they also came up with a few Indian blends as well.  But I wasn't here for the pizza, I was here for the all you can eat. Yes mam, 4+ hours of hiking gave me an allowance of 1000 calories to consume and consume them in the form of Indian curries, deep fried fares, and naan I did.  They didn't have signs on the dishes so I had to guess if I was trying a vegeterian version of butter chicken. Not that I could complain since I assumed most of them either had chickpeas, cauliflower, potatoes, or tomato. Everything was delicious and I particularly loved the HONEY BALLZ (gulab jamun) which came in two different textures. One was fluffy and light and the other was firm like soft cheese. Loooord I could eat those things all day.   They also serve pizza in their buffet, but in small samples. Although once they're put out, it's tough competition getting a slice. It's every man for himself. I grabbed one for my buddy Chris but when I made it back to our table his piece disappeared...in my BELLY.  The price was avg for buffet fares (about $20) but this is a great place to go to when you want a unique vegeterian buffet experience."}
{"text":"I ate here.  My advice is to show up at peak times.  It was mounds of glorious who-knows foods.  Foods need better labelling and ingredients list.  Sure, some stuff was labeled, do i remember what it was, or know what was in it?  HELL NO!!  It was pretty amazing food though.  The good deep fried yummies are watched like a hawk, the minute they are put out, swarms of east indians dive in and swoop picking them clean, watch you dont get your eye pecked out trying to grab some naan!..  The freshness of all food is not there, but the things that are fresh, you must pounce or be left to starve."}
{"text":"Whenever I pass-by this place seeing the board saying $10.99 buffet, I used to think when I would get a chance to try this place.  One day got a chance to try some Indian food and chose to try this restaurant as one of our friends being an Indian Vegetarian.  Heads up all, they don't serve any meat here. All are vegetarian dishes.  To our surprise this restaurant also serves pizza and there was a huge line up for pizza pick up.The restaurant was big enough and many of the tables were occupied, yet we do have ample space to dine in.   The first Indian buffet in Calgary I had seen that serves Pizza in buffet. There were many appetizers like Chole Batura, pakora, aloo tikki, pasta , french fries in honey garlic sauce ( which they serve occasionally) etc;   Naans are shuffled between plain and with some toppings on it. Nice selection of curries which included paneer, potatoes etc;  Rice items did not taste very great though. Also they serve a variety of seasonal fruits. And all these for so low price? A real deal not to miss. They do have desserts which were a way under par letting down the 5th star on my rating. I visited this place twice so far, food never disappointed me except the desserts. If you love Indian food, yet another place not to miss in Calgary."}
{"text":"I have tried their food several times. They have good variety of vegetarian dishes. Their buffet is reasonably priced and taste is ok. The only downside is that they put too much oil in their food."}
{"text":"This is a very nice vegetarian buffet with LOTS of options for a very reasonable price.   Nothing on the menuis too fancy but it's all very good.   I wouldn't consider it my favorite Indian food but it's a very good one to go to when I'm very hungry and am seeking variety.  It is still food produced on mass which would make it hard to compete with some of my favorite al a carte dishes elsewhere.  Food is very authentic - you can tell by the crowd.  I wouldn't consider it very spicy though.    Buffet at the time of review is $9.99 pp all you can eat.  It includes salad bar and pizza so it's not completely Indian but has a very large focus on Indian food."}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian Indian buffet for $9.99!   Decor is blah, cleanliness a bit blah. We were seated at a table with some clean glasses, some not. Luckily I picked out the dirty ones before pouring myself some water.  The buffet is ridiculous. Went back for thirds. Try the turmeric turnips. Never had better buttery flavours in my life.  Naan was rubbery, but not sure, some places will make fresh naan for your table. I was too busy stuffing myself with everything else.  And those green mango pickles make me crazy. Couldn't wash my fingers for a while, they smelled so good!  I've had authentic vegetarian Indian buffet before, and I have to say, the variety here blew my mind..."}
{"text":"Food was alright but hygiene is a big issue. None of the utensils were clean. There were drink stains on the floor, red and dried and not cleaned. The water pitcher had a spot of dried white things. Overall, a let down and I would not go back ever again."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch/dinner buffet for $10.  All vegetarian, all delicious.  Excellent selection of both sweet and savory items.  ...and pizza (?).  I didn't try it since I eat pizza pretty regularly and wanted to stay focused on the more traditional dishes.  I wish I'd had room to try a little of everything, but there's just no way.  We were definitely overwhelmed in the best way possible."}
{"text":"Moderate selection in the buffet. For vegetarian the flavours are not bad. A lot of rich sauces. My favourite item is the pizza. Would go back just for the pizza. Very tasty. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Spacious seating and delicious food. Food does have the taste of Punjab. Their buffet spread has lot of options and the staff is courteous. Everything upto the mark. We ordered lassi and they freshly prepared for one."}
{"text":"what a shoddy place. Visited here recently for dinner. Big Mistake. All the items looked tired and stale. There were lots of dishes, yet not 1 looked enticing enough to eat. All the chaats tasted the same, sabzi very subpar. Naan cold. Worst part Biryani had gone bad completely, definitely proved the point that the food was not freshly prepared for dinner and just leftovers from the morning buffet. When we reported it, they just said sorry and removed the tray from the buffet.  Would be better if they provide 'quality' good food instead of 'quantity' bad food.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Hmm great concept... but I worry about food freshness and sanitation.   I went here as a recommendation by a friend and we ended up staying past closing. That's where we saw some things we wished we hadn't.   All of the leftover curries from that night went back in the kitchen to be reserved for lunch the next day. They already looked a little dry and worse for wear for dinner, so maybe they were leftover from lunch too?  And all the salad bar items including cooked food items on there was just partially covered by a big long strip of saran wrap. Nothing air tight.   Being a waitress previously and a chef now I have respect for food safety and I'm going to take a wild guess that none of these things are good practices. I prefer fresh and knowing how old the food is. Anything more than a day or two old kinda freaks me out.   The good thing is it's vegetarian, so less likely to get food poisoning as it doesn't contain any meat.   For the price yes it's a good deal, but now you know why. So just be aware."}
{"text":"Horrible food no flavor or taste, looked super old and not fresh. Would not recommend this restaurant anyone."}
{"text":"My auntie brought me and my boyfriend here for lunch one day and there was literally nobody in there, the food was absolutely disgusting as I was not able to eat any of it from the buffet. Definately not my type of food and will not be going back"}
{"text":"What a reasonable and affordable vegetarian buffet for only $9.99/person!    We decided to try this buffet out after seeing an ad for it.  The restaurant is sitting in an old Pizza Hut location.  So the menu may have lots of vege Indian food and Indian sweets but it also has pizza - Indian-fusion ones!  The buffet does have pizza as well and very well made ones, too.  The spice is just right and it leaves a slow burn in your mouth!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've had the buffet in resturant and I've ordered the pizza to go and though I didn't find anything bad I don't feel I'd go back despite them being just down the street. It was nice to have options in the buffet as a vegetarian but nothing was overly flavourful or made you want more. The pizza was much to greasy for my taste."}
