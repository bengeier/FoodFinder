{"text":"Have been going here for years! I feel like it used to taste better but still go here for my Chinese BBQ fix."}
{"text":"Shopped here yesterday for a whole bbq duck and bbq pork. Spent over $45 on it and asked the owner for 2 tiny containers of green onion & ginger dipping sauce. She refused to give it to me and asked me to pay extra. The food was not that outstanding and already over priced compare to other shops...bad attitude not recommended."}
{"text":"Always argumentative, especially the lady owner.  She will not believe your comment their food was spoiled as if the customer deliberately ruin the bought food.  There is no trust and honour.     Overall, the experience was nightmarish.  Perhaps the food can be good at times, but the lady is hell bent to argue as if she is the victim and not the customer who paid for the bad food.    Sometimes, i have to wonder why people still go back for punishment."}
{"text":"My family came to buy a roast duck yesterday evening. Sadly, when we got home, we noticed that part of the duck legs were missing. The only conclusion we reached was that they took parts legs to save for their BBQ rice box combinations. The dishonesty of the establishment leaves a sour taste in our mouths. Feeling cheated, we will never return. BE AWARE!"}
{"text":"Just because it's your name, doesn't necessarily mean you should have it named after you.  It is difficult to take seriously a hole in the wall Chinese BBQ with such a ridiculously sounding title...that is until you tried the duck.  Okay, it's not Peking Duck quality, and the birds are not serialized from birth to keep track of quality, and there are certainly no time wasted on decorum, but for a local BBQ place where one can purchase a duck, half a duck, chicken, BBQ pork, duck liver, sausages, tofu, and a simple rice takeaway, there are no competition within a 3km radius.  Hell, you can even order a whole suckling roast pig, as long as you give them a week's notice..and presumably some kind of deposit.  The idea of not having a whole pig available immediately for the buying is somehow comforting.   There's little doubt to quality as He He Long has endured in this unforgiving plaza for as long as I can remember.  I've known people who live in houses located in the dreamland neighborhood of Bridal Path endure treacherous journeys in their Range Rovers and S-class to compete for specific parts of whatever animal available here.  The duck livers sells quickly, usually nothing left by 3pm.  It would do this place great injustice to further describe He He Long, you either like it or your don't, and mostly all patrons are locals.  It's not the reason to visit this plaza, but it would be unreasonable to come here and not buy something from this BBQ joint!  Blame only yourself if you need to ask where this place is, and what you receive in return is a look of awkwardness."}
{"text":"Mom and pap store. Good tofu and bbq roast pork. Here's the skinny by ranking of roast pork based on taste.  1. Peak Restaurant First Markham Place 2. Kom Juk Yuen 3. He He  Based on price Kom Juk Yuen is first both the later are expensive for bbq."}
{"text":"great quality and price. the people are really nice. get the duck and chicken those are the best.  the soup is amazing too and vegatibles taste really good."}
{"text":"An enthusiastic 4 stars for the \"half fat\" bbq pork and for the chicken legs, both of which I think are much better than downtown fave, Kom Jug Yuen, that people tend to rave about, but I have repeatedly been unimpressed by.  I'm not as much a fan of He He Long's duck nor their crispy roast pork (see my other reviews for THE BEST roast pork anywhere) but I do love their char siu pork!  TIP for my fellow white folk, who may be unfamiliar with ordering Chinese bbq pork - DO NOT request it extra lean! Extra lean pork is drier and has less flavour than the \"half fat\" portions of the pig. It seems that white folks demand the lean so often that I typically have to repeat my request for the \"half fat\" pork several times before I am believed :)  This is one of my very favorite places to get bbq pork anywhere in the city, and it is just a super-tiny take-out-only joint, but I have yet to be disappointed.  Cheers, .James."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here,  the BBQ pork is great! Sauce is delicious and the flavour of the pork is just right.   The roasted pork on the other hand was overcooked. Not to my liking. Skin was hard and tough when we got it so it's not fresh either.   I guess it is hit or miss.   You're looking at $10/pound for each dish.   It wasn't that busy when I went and no line at all, could be just that day or time but at least the place is clean compared to other Chinese bbq places."}
{"text":"I really should have given them a 5 star last time. Yes, they are a tad more expensive than your standard Chinese BBQ joint, but that's because their Chinese BBQ is outstanding. I came in today and asked for the most tender BBQ pork they could give me, because I just had my wisdom teeth removed and I can't really chew yet. When my pork was being cut, I could see the meat almost melting beneath the weight of the cleaver because it was so moist and tender. It's magical stuff."}
{"text":"You need to try this little hidden gem.  They only do take out and their BBQ pork (cha siu) is out of this world.  My family only eats their BBQ pork and would not eat anywhere else.  Try their pig -a new one is always hanging in the front of the store.  They are always fresh.  The skin is so crunchy.  If you want to take it home, make sure you cut the corners of the box so that it will breath or else the skin will not be crunchy when you get home.  Better yet, leave this box open while you are driving.  It's from condensation because of how hot the pig is.  At around 4pm you'll see a lineup of people, all of a sudden.  They know that the pig is just about to come out so they will buy it for dinner.   I don't know how many pigs they sell a day but it must be alot.  There are 3 tables in the store for people who just want a fast lunch.  You can get a BBQ plate with rice and some vegetables for around $6.  You can also order the BBQ stuff by the pound.  You can even pick the piece of meat, if you know what you are doing.  Try BBQ stuff fatter because the meat around it taste softer, even though you might be on a diet.     There's alot of BBQ places out there but there must a something about a place that only sells BBQ food.  It means they are the best at this one thing. Bring some home.  You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Although this place is mostly takeout, they do have a few tables and seating for maybe around ten diners. The BBQ food hanging in the window looked good but, unfortunately, I was disappointed with the quality, taste, and cost. I had ordered a combo with BBQ duck and crispy pork with rice for takeout. A bowl of soup was included.  My first disappointment, almost shock, was the cost. It was almost $12.00! Compared to all of the other Chinese BBQ shops I go to in Scarborough and Markham, this was at least 50% more expensive!  The quality of the meats and the taste were okay. Just okay. Some cabbage was also included. For the cost, I expected more."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place so many times because I use to live in this area. After moving to Scarborough for a while, my parents stopped coming here because it was too out of the way. However, every time I come back here, I am amazed by the amazing \"cha siu\" that they offer. The owners are also quite friendly. Every time I go, they always smile and stop having a great conversation with me."}
{"text":"Brought the roast duck and BBQ pork meal to go for $9.60 tax in. Comes with soup, rice and veggies. Portions are huge. Lots of meat and not just lots but good quality cuts too. Its a filling meal. At this price it is higher than most Chinese BBQ joints but as long as the quality is there and the portions are large then you really do get your moneys worth here.  Gotta love the name of this place. He He Long - its so easy to remember."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chinese bbq places in the area. Also seems to be the only legit stand alone bbq place. The quality is good but is a bit in the pricier side."}
{"text":"Been looking for a bbq duck place near me for a while. Usually have to go to Scarborough for anything decent. Googled this place, went, and surprised just how much meat I got. I was going to get more meat expecting it would be a small portion but was like, \"whoa, that's good\". Ever been to like Chipotle, and said no need for extra meat cause your first scoop was fat enough. Yeah, that good. Soup was meh, but does anyone really expect that to ever be any good?   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been coming to He He Long for years now.  I do all my grocery shopping at the supermarket next door and always pop by here to get my Chinese BBQ fix.  Pros: Some of the best BBQ pork in town friendly staff  Cons: Prices are high compared to other Chinese BBQ places  As I said, I do most of my grocery shopping next door so I'm here on average about once a week.  He He Long has some of the best BBQ pork in the city.  As always, if you know what you're doing, you always ask for half and half. It's always very good every time I get some.  I'm also a fan of the steamed free range chicken.  The roast pork and BBQ duck are also above average.  I recommend though as i do to all my friends, try the BBQ pork, you won't regret it.  The staff here are very friendly.  They're English isn't the best but they try their best even if you don't speak Chinese.  As a regular, they know me and always strike up conversation with me.  The lady at the front is very polite.    There is only one thing that keeps this place from being 5 star for me, price.  They charge $9.50 a pound for BBQ pork.  That is by far the most expensive I've also seen in the city.  Don't get me wrong, it is worth every cent, but it's very pricey compared to other Chinese BBQ places.  They have a monopoly here because there's no other Chinese BBQ place even remotely near by.  Still, like I said, it's worth every cent.  Just wish it didn't hit my wallet so hard every time.  If you live in the Finch and Leslie area or anywhere near by, this is the place to go to get your Chinese BBQ fix.  Try the BBQ pork, you won't be disappointed.  Oh yes, like most Chinese establishments, bring cash.  They do not accept any other form of payment."}
{"text":"The bbq meats at this place is delicious! Like other reviewers have mentioned, yes it is slightly more expensive than other places, I do find the quality of their food is very good.  They have such good variety! In addition to the roasted pork, duck, soya sauce chicken and BBQ pork they also have the various cooked intestines, soya sauce chicken leg, chicken wings, the squid, some sort of sausage, salted free run chicken and a lot of other items.   Our go to items are usually BBQ pork, roasted pork if they have ribs and half a chicken. It's true what another Yelper mentioned, if you ask for a lean piece of pork it's usually very dry. You need to get a bit of fat with that pork.   The owners/workers are very nice. They usually chat up my mom a lot when she's there lol. Definitely pop by here if you want some quality BBQ!"}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant - mostly a take-out Chinese BBQ place.  Porks they use are pretty large, so it's more fatty compared to places which use medium size porks.  If you can a place that uses strictly medium size pigs, stick with them, cause those are hard to find.  Its like places who only use Cornish hens for chicken.. speaks about the quality expectation of the business owner.. unfortunately this isn't one of those places.  What I like about this place is two things mainly... apart from the main stream items, they almost always have pig ears, tails, feet, tongue, and intestines prepared AND the hoiseen sauce over here is extra good!!  What I don't like about this place is the butcher.. he always tries to give you more then what you ask for. Since everything is sold by the pound, they always try to chop/cut more then ask for, if I ask for 1lbs, i expect this place in particular to cut 1.2lbs for you.. always upselling a bit more product everytime.."}
{"text":"I was really craving some BBQ pork and chicken.  This place satisfies my craving.  I chose well today - the glaze on the pork was good (not too sweet) and I chose a lean piece which had loads of flavour.  Chicken was ok - pork is better.  It is expensive, but satisfies the craving until my next visit to HK."}
