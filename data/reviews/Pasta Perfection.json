{"text":"This place has finally closed down!  The one time I visited, I ordered lasagna, and this 50 year old asian lady microwaved some soggy slop and served it to me. Afterwards I got sick. No wonder this place closed down...."}
{"text":"Small portions of instant pasta for $10+. They don't even bring it to your table of 6. Not impressed."}
{"text":"This dingy little pasta joint caught me on my blindside. On one hand the facilities are gross, nobody goes there except a few creepy regulars (it seems), and the cook is super awkward, hard to understand, and doesn't listen very well.  The pasta speaks for itself though. I had the Spaghetti Bolognese and it was actually quite good by western spaghetti standards. I even told the cook how I had just returned from a month long trip to Italy and that his spaghetti was quite good. He didn't seem impressed by the compliment. But I intentionally tried to eat mostly pastas while in Italy so I could say which ones were the best and to have a true understanding of good authentic pasta for when I get back home to Canada.  The place is empty even around supper time which implies to me that most people aren't too impressed with the place and I can completely understand how they wouldn't be as I'm a major stickler for the quality of service received while dinning out.  If your around the area and you don't want Panzorotto, Pizza Pizza, or McDicks then maybe step into here and enjoy your awkward yet tasty encounter. Prepare for gas issues later on though."}
