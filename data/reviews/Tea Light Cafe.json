{"text":"I love the place.  Was a bit hesitant at first but friends recommended it, and it turned out to be quite good.  They even have a few choices for those that aren't into Asian fare."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!! I got the vegetarian pho with tofu. Got there 5 minutes before closing and they still sat us! Incredible food and incredible people."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Pho was mediocre. However, our chicken in the combination dinner was tough and dry. It's probably one of the few Vietnamese places in N. Scottsdale but if you are willing to drive to Phoenix (ex. Da Vang), Tempe  or Chandler you will find restaurants that have more authentic and traditional Vietnamese cuisine. We will stick to traditional American cuisine like sandwiches and burgers or look for Italian restaurants next time we are in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service as well. The menu is simple and straightforward, not huge and confusing. I have had a few different items from the menu and all have been delicious. My usual order is the combo beef plus egg roll. My only gripe would be that I wish they were open later for when I get late night cravings."}
{"text":"BEST PHO SOUP IN THE VALLEY! I get the Beef Pho w/ brisket or chicken. Amazing little mom and pop shop! I love the Pho here because not only are the broth & rice noodles delicious but they put green onions in it and give you all the fixings that you want according to your taste. You can put in bean sprouts, thai basil, fish sauce & lemons along with sriracha if you like it spicy."}
{"text":"Very flavorful and lots of fresh ingredients. Was a great lunch. I had the vegetarian Pho and spring rolls. I love the peanut dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"Good service and fast delivery each time.  The food, however, not the tastiest.   We have had much better vietnamese food in the area.  Noodles not the tastiest nor the pho"}
{"text":"One of the challenges of rating a place like this (as other folks have pointed out) is that there is a pretty diverse range of exposure to this cuisine by the others who have already reviewed it.   Perhaps it was an off day but man was I disappointed. Full disclosure: I am a pho snob. There's one particular favorite spot in San Diego and no matter where I've roamed outside of Vietnam, no place comes close. With that being said, the pho here was just full of sad.  The broth lacked the full-bodied herbaciousness I really appreciate about good pho.  Now, to be fair, this is not marketed as a restaurant specializing in the pho experience but rather has a variety of vietnamese foods (banh mi, pho, bun).   I had the Tea Lite Special...it was not special. Flat flavor profile on the broth. Bland meat. The spring roll was not a win. BUT when the pho came out sans fixins' plate (basil, bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos) and they charged me an extra dollar for it after I went back in and asked for it...that just put me over.   The gentleman at the counter (maybe the owner???) was also pretty surly. All told, I likely won't be back."}
{"text":"Although my Vietnamese friend informed me this particular place wasn't completely authentic, we both agreed that the flavors were fresh, simple and yet still rich and full bodied. I've come here on several occasions, and I'm always satisfied and pleased. All the dishes are I've tried have been pleasing."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place That my boyfriend and I go. They have a great chicken salad and the Barbequed chicken I to die for.!"}
{"text":"Let's not get too crazy with the five stars and Vietnamese food. It's hearty, affordable and fast. It may not be savory but, however, remains delicious for both humble and economic reasons. And that's okay, because I want to experience different cultures and their cuisine without all the American influences.  Tasty offerings include the (#3) beef with egg roll and their \"pho bo.\"  The beef is seasoned \"awesomely\" and comes with fried spring rolls over a California-king-sized bed of rice noodles and greens. As for the \"pho\", it is a very delicious soup that you must try at least once in life.  Lastly, compliment your meal with a Tai tea or Vietnamese coffee and you'll leave much more caffeinated (and perhaps happier) than you arrived."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for lunch.  Fantastic Food and Service........  The Spring Rolls are the best we have ever had....  The soup is amazing....  We will be going back...."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch the other day, food was pretty meh. I'd give 2.5 stars if I could, the spring rolls were very nice and stuffed with shrimp. However, the order of chicken I had was completely dried out -- it was seriously like eating chalk. The flavor was ok, I guess, but the meat was so overcooked it was impossible to really tell."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here! The price is very reasonable, the cashier and server are very attentive and helpful. I only wish they were open on Sundays! Have the delicious chicken pho and taro bubble tea!!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of selection as far as food goes but it's name is 'Cafe' so how much can you expect? What matters is that the food was good. It's not too savvy on vegetarian dishes but most places are. Cozy. Nice."}
{"text":"This is an attempt at Pho and Vietnamese food.  I am probably spoiled by living in LA for 10 years... but this was rough.   I would have given 2.5 stars if able, because the service was nice, but the Boba (Bubble Tea) was not right and the Pho was just noodles in soup.  This works, because it's the only place in the general area doing this type of food...but i've found some better Pho places in the central/west side of phoenix.  Which is a lot further away if you live in Scottsdale, but it's worth it.  I think this is a great way to introduce people to the \"Pho Restaurant\" world...but if you think this is good...take a leap, and go to a \"real\" Pho place."}
{"text":"I've recently become a huge pho fan, so I was excited to try Tea Light Cafe, which is right in my neighborhood.  While it wasn't quite as authentic as a place I was recently turned onto in Downtown LA, it was still very tasty  and fresh.  A cup of hot tea and a bowl of pho is always wonderful on a cold winter day!  At $8, it's enough for two to share, or it can be two meals for one person!  We don't exactly have a lot of independent ethnic restaurants in this area, so it's nice to have Tea Light Cafe serving up yummy Vietnamese food - hopefully people will continue to support it."}
{"text":"We stopped in yesterday at lunch time, it was packed, lined up to the door so we viewed this as a good sign and decided to come back today.  I ordered the vegetarian Pho.  It came with wilted bean sprouts, NO vegetables! Except for a one inch piece of scallion and some tofu and noodles.  The other dish we ordered was a chicken pho, it was the same as the vegetarian pho but with a few ounces of chicken.  I have never had pho served without vegetables. Sliced carrots, book chop, broccoli are the usual fare in pho along with noodles. And to top it off the server was obviously not enjoying his job .  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been a handful of times and always get the tea lite special - it's some rolls with a bowl of pho. Very delicious and the best pho in my hood. The place can get a little crowded because of the smallness but it's definitely worth it. They also offer take out if that's your thing."}
{"text":"Hands-down our favorite fast Asian restaurant.  My husband and I love Asian food and their food is awesome.  The spring rolls are soft, not fried, which we love and the soups are favorites of ours.  Service is fast whether you're taking out or dining in and we love that we see the owners there often."}
{"text":"Great bun, the pork was cooked and seasoned just right, and the ingredients were separated so I could combine them to my taste. The pricing was good except the iced coffee was a bit steep. My partner had the sampler plate and loved it she wow a bit disappointed with the quantity of shrimp for the up charge. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"So cheap, #3 Bun is my very favorite. I'm here 3 times a week, it's probably unhealthy. I have never eaten in, but the staff is very friendly for takeout. They don't even judge me for going in there all the time :) I would also like to try the Pho! It's supposed to be fantastic."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. I eat here 2 days/wk., always excellent. I regularly order the #3 with beef or tea light special, both very good. At $8.95 for a quick, yummy lunch in north scottsdale, great choice."}
{"text":"Well.... Let's see where should I start. First off if you are looking for a restaurant experience, you won't find it here. No one to greet you at the door showing you to your seat and stuff no, and being it the first time for my bro and I, we had no clue what to do. We saw a big bill board sign with pictures of different Pho types and a bald white guy at the counter. I know...should have seen the sign right? Should have ran when we had a chance. But since it's our first time here in PHX AZ and was craving Pho and don't really have no choice of pho restaurant nearby we said what the hell. BiG MISTAKE!!! So remember no menu  so we picked something from the bill board, being a Pho loving guy and from the Bay Area CA where pho is a plentiful, I'm looking for that #1 Pho you know? Pho dac biet or English Pho combination with everything in it. Bald guy with no name tag said \"No we don't have that, just what's up there\" So I had no choice but to go with just beef Pho. Now get this we have to pay up front before we get our food and there is a tip line so at that time I'm thinking to myself who am I tipping? The bald white guy taking my order who hands me a cup to get my own water and grab my own utensil? I say Zero for that. The place is small kinda crowded. Anyways so the Pho came, it look decent I posted a picture but soup was on the light side at least for both me and my bro. We agreed it was light, and too small amount of noodle too much onion that it alter the taste of the noodles, NOT Good, very disappointing. We finish quick and left. I only give it one star I can't recommend this place to anyone. Then only good thing was the waiter who chase us down when we left and my bro left his hat. Which merit it a second star. This is NOT A PLACE FOR PHO. Go that extra mile and find another Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Oh boy! Where do I start? First off, it was 110 in the middle of summer, and they didn't even bother to turn on the AC, only had fans on (#1 big no no, especially given the nice area of Scottsdale). I saw the thermostat say 92 inside!!!!!   Secondly, their menu selection is pretty limited. Just Pho Bo, Pho Ga and a few of their so-called Banh Mi.  I ordered their Pho Bo. Soup was totally bland, the meat was really dry (actually come to think of it, there were barely any beef in it!). Prices were pretty expensive too.  I also tried their pork Banh Mi sandwich. Boy what a mistake, the bread crumbled, the sauce too sweet, the pork was dry. There was no pate in it whatsoever, definitely not an \"official Banh Mi\".  This place does not do Viet Cuisine justice. It is totally catering to the Non-asian taste.  I would recommend going to Da Vang, Khai Hoan for a good hearty bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"Came in for a bowl of soothing pho one day I when I was feeling especially sick. Pho did not blow me away but it was pretty good. I inquired about tea afterwards to help me feel better as well, and the manager steered me to the appropriate kind for how I was feeling and ended up steeping me a cup on the house.  Amazing how much a small kind gesture like this can make your day when you feel like crap.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Small, but very nice menu. I ordered the pho, and my friends ordered pho and pork chops. We loved it. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Pho soup I have ever had! I can't believe I ate the whole thing! Well...yes I can, actually.   What clinched it for me was that I ordered it To Go, which is almost never a good idea when it comes to the pho (do not attempt to assemble at your desk! I repeat! Do NOT assemble at your desk!). But everything was securely packaged and well-presented. Plenty of everything (noodles, meat, herbs, sauce, jalapenos, etc) and oh so tasty.   I've got my sights set on the BBQ Pork & Rice noodle bowls for my next visit, which will be soon.   Go get your pho on!"}
{"text":"Best pho In North Scottsdale.  Period!  The Tealight special is the best deal in the house, and their herbal chai tea is simply awesome!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho I've found in town yet.  Good spring rolls to, the sauce was a little to runny though.  I hit this place up 3 times a month to get my vietnamese fix."}
{"text":"I work in the same complex as Tea Light and have come here a few times.  The food is amazing; I was honestly surprised as to how good it was. The service is friendly, and quick. Even when I'm not working, I will drive out here to have some Tea Light. They are wonderful."}
{"text":"I'd characterize myself as a Pho Ho (I know that doesn't rhyme) so this rating is going to be lower than what other people may thing simply because my standards for Pho are snobbishly high.  A very cute place, the decor and ambiance seems built very much upon the words \"serenity\" and \"harmony\", which is great, but as you might tell with the tone of this post, comes off a little corny.  That said, the food here is not too bad.  For lunch, it's a decently priced meal for a lot of grub.  I got the Shrimp & Pork Spring Rolls and the Pho (which they call Beef Noodles I believe).    My first impression unfortunately when the app came out was that the Spring Rolls used iceberg lettuce instead of basil or mint or a more dark green leafy green.  The iceberg lettuce gave the Spring Rolls a cheaper feel that I didn't really enjoy.  The Pho was better though they seemed quite stingy on the accoutrement, as I got two jalapeno slices and a sorry looking stem of basil.  In addition, the thin slices of beef were definitely overcooked and tasted not unlike a sponge.  But the noodles themselves were solid and the broth with a little Sriracha got my blood and tastebuds pumping.  I don't know if I'll come back but I would say for lunch, this place is not a bad place to introduce somebody to Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"there was barely any chicken or noodles in the pho, really disappointing, but the flavor was good. terrible service."}
{"text":"All items on menu are full of flavor.  You can eat inside or outside. Take home is available too. You get a ton of food for the money. I love the matcha(drink). It's the absolute BEST.  Owners husband and wife, so cool, my first time in I was looking for something tasty, new with a good feeling after I ate it.  I asked what do you recommend for a rookie.  Chicken pho soup, spring rolls. That was two years ago. Kid friendly too."}
{"text":"I like my Pho soup stronger but this is still pretty good and reasonably priced. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is worth checking out! So good. I usually get the chicken pho. But everything is great. The staff is super friendly as well. I've tried other places for pho but always compare it to Tea Lite Cafe's. Hard for me to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"If you're in the north Scottsdale area and in the mood for pho, Tea Light Cafe hits the spot.  The menu is limited - mostly pho and some rice plates (i.e., your standard Vietnamese fare).  That's okay though, since I found the pho to be solid.  Good broth, though slightly skimpy on the noodles compared to most pho restaurants.  It's a small restaurant.  Wasn't too crowded when we were there, but has the potential to get full I would imagine.  The price is reasonable, though I've definitely had cheaper.  Perhaps it's inherent for the restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is the closest place that offers a decent bowl of pho, my comfort food on a cold or cloudy day. I always have my order taken out since this little place is always packed during lunch time.   I've tried the Pho with beef (#11), the Tea lite sandwich with grilled beef, and the Bun (#3). And my fav is the Pho, especially the broth! The sandwich was okay, i thought the grilled beef was a bit too salty.. And the Bun was good, but the same as the sandwich, salty beef...  This is definitely a good place to grab a quick lunch with limited time, fast, affordable, and tasty!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for the sandwiches so far...I can't tell you how often I crave Vietnamese sandwiches.  I used to get them in San Francisco all the time (much cheaper though), and I was quite happy to see one in my neighborhood.  The sandwich was great and the Pho menu looks good, I'm sure I'll be back to try it.  The service was just okay, and the prices are a little high, but all in all, I'm glad it's there, and will return for sure."}
{"text":"I have been going to \"TLC\" for a couple years now.  This is a great spot located near the movies at the Scottsdale 101 shopping center.  The number one thing, in my opinion, about restaraunts is consistency.  I have never been let down here.  I usually get the same thing everytime i go so I cant really comment on the depth of the menu.  But if you like Summer spring rolls which are packed with noodles, shrimp, pork, chicken wrapped in rice paper you will love the ones at Tea Light.  I follow the summer rolls with a huge bowl of chicken soup.  This soup has a phenominal flavor with asian noodles and a genorous amount of tasty chicken.  There are sauces left out on the tables so you can make your soup as spicy hot as you want.  The very casual order counter and friendly service allows for an evironment that makes you feel like you are at the neighhborhood Cafe.  You will see the same people there everytime and they are as nice and appreciative of your business as they can be.   If you are looking for a good lunch or a healthy dinner...TLC is your spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place ! If I can have their shrimp Pho  everyday I will... so tasty, perfect size portion. Casual place.. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"New to Arizona and have been dying to find a Pho place! I have found my new home! This is the best place I have had Pho since living in Central California! Very happy customer!!! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"What a great little spot!  Went last night and I ordered the pho and she ordered the chicken soup. We both loved our food and would go again for sure. The pho was so good, I finished the whole monsterous bowl!   The owner (I am guessing he is the owner) was working and was very helpful.   Don't be discouraged that this is located in a strip mall.   Do yourself a favor and give it a try. It is cheap and worth the experience."}
{"text":"I miss this place! I used to get lunch from here quite regularly when I worked in the area - excellent noodle bowl with imperial rolls, fresh veggies, and great tea. Well priced. Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"We had a great beef pho.  The owner was extremely kind and let us grab some takeout even as they were closing.  We sat outside and enjoyed a great meal."}
{"text":"Great place an inexpensive and tasty lunch .... I've been there many times and it's always excellent!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Tea Light Special with veggie pho. The staff were super friendly and my food came out quick. This was my first time here and the gentleman who dropped off my food noticed I didn't get silverware and napkins (I didn't know I get them on my own), so he brought some to me. The Pho was delicious although I wish it came with more bean sprouts, lines, jalapeños and cilantro on the side. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese food.  Fairly priced.  My go to for Vietnamese food.  Glad it it still around is the midst of the many Scottsdale eateries in the area!"}
{"text":"I haven't dined in, but have ordered takeout from here twice so far. Both times my order has been ready right on time, and my cold drinks were kept in the refrigerator until pickup so they stayed nice and cold. I can only speak to the pho and the coconut boba. The pho is ok - just ok. The first time I got it the broth was a little bland (but not any more bland than most places), and the second time it was almost too salty, but didn't have much of the traditional pho spice flavour. The first time my take-home ingredients looked fresh and they gave us quite a bit, and the coconut boba was perfect. The second time it looked like there was a little less meat and the piece of basil had literally been picked over, so there were only a few small leaves remaining on it. The bean sprouts looked a little wilted and sad. My coconut boba had ice chunks, and only about four actual balls of tapioca, all of which had frozen and had a really strange texture. Since the first time was so good, I'd be willing to order here again on the good faith that the second time was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Dark setting but the pho was good - the noodles were over cooked and mushy. Great having the soda machine - spring rolls were made in a very messy fashion - slow down all the processes and more attention to product. Ordering process not very personal but overall I will try again."}
{"text":"BEST place to eat ever! It's a bit of a drive to get to from where I am, but it is so worth it!  Whoever said it was tasteless lies! This is healthy good food! They give you lime, basil, bean sprouts, etc to go with your meal! I LOVE the little rolls that come with the Number 1  meal. The soup is fantastic!!! The food is the best!"}
{"text":"their beef pho noodles was so good and tasty but their boba drink wasn't! it taste like it was water down!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I moved here last year from Orlando, which has a suprisingly robust Vietnamese community and tons of great places to get Vietnamese food. I was thrilled to find this near my home and the food is great.  I usually get the chicken pho, which is very good. It comes with sprouts and spices like cilantro, jalapenos, scallions, etc. that you can add to the broth. This allos you to make it as mild or spicy as your mood demands and allows you to play \"chef\" a little, which is an added bonus."}
{"text":"I like the pho here because it isn't as oily as some others I have had.  Everything at Tea Light Cafe seems lighter than the normal Vietnamese fare, however, it is a nice alternative considering the area."}
{"text":"I get Pho and a taro boba every time I eat here. It's always really well prepared. I wish they had a little bit more variety on their menu, but everything I've had has always been tasty and I love the owner and the staff. Great place to eat before catching a movie"}
{"text":"I came in last week because I have been looking for a quality Viapnamese restaurant here in the valley. The food was great, and cashier John was so helpful and gave us great suggestions."}
{"text":"I love this place and try to sneak away for a quick meal chance I get. The food is always fresh and the presentation is lovely. I always get the special because you get a bit of everything for a reasonable price. The spring rolls and the pho are my favorite. Their green tea completes any meal you select.   This is a great choice for a casual meal with friends, family or kids if you don't like to eat alone."}
{"text":"Clean environment,  food is of good quality,  tastes good, and friendly service.  A well deserved 5 star.  A wonderful gem in North Scottsdale especially if you are looking for a good Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Whether you like this place will depend on whether you have experienced good Vietnamese food in the past. I have lived all over including SF so I know what the food is supposed to taste like. In general the food is just okay here. The spring rolls are below average and the peanut sauce is not right. The pho is just average - not bad, but nothing to write home about. I found a better place just off the 101 and cave creek by Costco... Still searching for a great pho place in N Scottsdale."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment. Was really in the mood. First the guy gets the order wrong and is slow to correct the mistake. I order grilled chicken. Seems  simple. I have never seen or tasted chicken that looked more like sundries dog turds. Dry, causing me to choke. You can tell I am loving this place. The man behind the counter seemed mildly annoyed taking our order. The girl was sweet if not somewhat clueless. Sound good? Took two bites and left. Wondered why I took a second bite. Sick. They could have cared less. Oh the rice was mushy. Slice of cucumber"}
{"text":"Great place to get Pho in North Scottsdale and coconut boba drink. The environment is super cozy and seems to draw a fair amount of people every time I come in."}
{"text":"Great pho and the bun is super good also. This place is run really excellently. Food is delivered quickly and the owner is normally around and making sure every customer is happy. A great option for a healthy quick meal out."}
{"text":"Let's be honest here...is the pho good?...it's mediocre at best and overpriced.  That being said, you do feel safe eating here...so that's worth something and I guess that sense of security makes the pho taste 'good'.   So now let's talk about the waiter...the husband.  For description purposes...he's the white guy and not the older Asian guy. I'm assuming that his wife is the one that is cooking in the back since she came out wearing a purple chef's jacket (sign number 1 that this pho is going to be mediocre). This guy thinks he is actually working at some 5-star Michelin French restaurant. He got upset and gave me a stern warning that my 15 month old baby cannot bring outside food to eat in his fancy restaurant and it was pho or pho-get-about-it!  I looked around and quickly realized my mistake. I should have known that I stepped into the Taj Mahal from the 80's Coke machine next to the door and his son that was walking around 'working' with Dre Beats headphones around his neck and a Kangol style hat!    So I guess this is review is more of a heads up to others to make sure to dress up and be on your best behavior for this super fancy place!  By the way, I heard the wife's purple chef's jacket was a gift from the James Beard Foundation...pho has sure come a long way!  Can you imagine going to Da Vang (a real pho restaurant) and the chef is wearing a colored patterned chef's jacket! Ha! The looks that chef would get from the workers and customers would be epic!"}
{"text":"Whenever my children come to town, Tea Light Cafe is the first stop on the way from the airport. Millions of options for dining in Scottsdale, but it's our favorite. Fresh clean flavors and incredibly fast service."}
{"text":"The pork meatball sandwich is the single best sandwich I have ever eaten! The pho is always delicious, shrimp spring rolls are refreshing, and the tea is first rate.  I always feel appreciated when I come here, and I never leave unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Very simplified menu.  The \"beef pho\" (ha) was surprisingly great; the broth was delicious.  Perfect for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Solid choice for Pho.  Small interior for dining but they also have some seats outside.  If you are craving Pho and you are this far north in Scottsdale it's your best bet!"}
{"text":"Very average and the meat seems a bit \"mysterious\" looking not to mention in my large bowl of pho, I only had 2 small pieces of \"chicken\".  The pho is a good sized portion but mediocre at best. The spring rolls were average spring rolls. Nothing special about the food here. Pricing is decent. Iwill not go back. Too many other fantastic places."}
{"text":"the food is very good here but the service isnt very nice. they dont greet or thank customers properly. i dont know why the owner is so mean when i come here all the time. so i have to give it three stars for the bad service they need to learn better customer service or at least some manners"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Vietnamese food in north Scottsdale.  Nice folks running the place.  We seem to always get the number 3 but every thing we have had here is good including the pho.  There is a nice outside seating area that is great when the wether is nice."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their chicken pho. It is simple but my body feels great after. It is my Vietnamese Chicken penicillin:) my husband loves their spring rolls. We get their food at least once a week ."}
{"text":"Cute little place! We ordered beef pho & spring rolls. Food came out FAST and the pho was hot and flavorful. Since we moved so close, this will be our new place when we crave pho."}
{"text":"Are you looking for really good, authentic pho?  OMG, so am I!  Service is really very, very fast.  The food quality is pretty good.  They say they do not MSG in their broth, but they pour in the salt!  The broth was so overly salty, it was inedible for me.  The beef pho is lacking the authentic bites of tendon & tripe; these are not offered at all.   Gonna keep looking..."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week.  My favorite meal is #14, with extra beef.  Chris and his wife are very accommodating, nice, and always welcoming.  The atmosphere is light, fun and the staff always has a smile.  Definitely come here for a great time with some awesome Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Be careful of their green matcha tea. They will charge you around 7 bucks for a small cup of matcha green tea. They say they will add orange juice to \"enhance\" the flavor. The end result is beyond catastrophic: I got green color diluted, old orange juice.   Their pho is bland and unauthentic. All and all I'm sad I wasted time and money on such a disappointed meal."}
{"text":"Ordered  the pho chicken...  where's the flavor.  ?  Very disappointed.   i only had two small pieces of chicken in the soup..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I've been wanting to go for some time. It was well worth the wait. I enjoyed it very much. It was a lot of food but, didn't sit heavy on you at all. Very simple food with very fresh ingredients. I had the beef noodle bowl with the egg rolls, next time I want to try out they're soup."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, the food is okay.  The prices are good and the customer service is okay.  If you want a quick, Vietnamese dish such as Pho, give it a try, the prices can't be beat.  One thing that disturbed me as I noticed on my last visit, the owner dumping the remaining customer's water into the money plant that sits in the front when you walk in.  It kind of grossed me out.  As you know our mouths breed bacteria, and it's being mixed and cultivated in that money tree plat.  Yuck!  For that reason alone, I may not come back."}
{"text":"Here's the thing: The service at Tea Lite (i swear it says Tea LIGHT on the sign, but maybe not) is great, everyone is super nice, food comes out real quick and it's also real healthy. You also get a great meal for your dollar. What is keeping me from giving them a higher rating is that it's too safe.  I love to come here for a quick, healthy, inexpensive lunch, but if I want the real stuff I'll go to the competing restaurant a little ways away. The phô at Tea Lite Café is sorta gentrified, a product of the neighborhood that it's in. There's no tripe or tendon in the broth, and there's no option to add it in if you desire a dish a little more adventurous. There are plenty of options if you want to spice it up, but not if you want to add more general flavor to the soup that i expect to enjoy when i go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Maybe it's because their specialty is a quick lunch and therefore a more streamlined menu? I am however super grateful that's one of the few places in the Airpark vicinity where I can get a boba tea!  Now, I am no way condemning this restaurant, and in fact I recommend that you go there for lunch and support them, and if you like, request some of the omitted goodies for your phô so that someday they'll change their menu up and I can grant them a couple more stars."}
{"text":"Some people think that a non-vietnamese clientele means the food is not authentic or as good as other places. Wrong! I have eaten Vietnamese food in Asia, SF, LA, and Phoenix and Tea Light does a good job making customers happy! The place is modern, the staff friendly, and the BBQ is very tasty.  The pork chop is very good, and so is the bbq pork entree. The boba drinks are good too and when I'm in this part of town, I always make sure to stop by and eat there.  It gets 4 stars b/c of course there is better Vietnamese food, but overall this place is a hit!"}
{"text":"Waited too long to write this review! Excellent food for a reasonable price! The Pho is a favorite of my sons and I love the bowl with rice noodles and beef plus egg rolls on top! A+"}
{"text":"Found this hidden place by accident.  You order at the counter and they bring your food to the table. we started with shrimp and pork spring rolls. They were good and a large portion.  When it comes to Pho the choices are limited to basic chicken or beef. It is definitely aimed towards main stream eaters...nothing exotic here. The chicken Pho was good. The broth was fabulous.  I would try the bun next time... I liked it here and if I was close by I would return. I don't think I will go out of my way to become a regular."}
{"text":"My parents love pho so I've practically been enjoying Vietnamese cuisine since the womb. Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now.  We both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus.   The pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me.   But let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us. It'll definitely do in a pinch although I am sure I will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have enjoyed food from this restaurant on several occasions. Unfortunately my most recent experience has really ruined my opinion. I called to place a take out order and was placed on hold. The person obviously forgot he made this decision.  I could hear him taking order after order. I would have hung up and called back but I knew the line wouldn't disconnect. I walked into the restaurant on my phone and showed him I had been on hold for 17 minutes. He was obviously new and had made an honest mistake. I informed the manager, who looked at my phone, said he was sorry, and walked away. Not only was his apology insincere but he made no effort to rectify the situation. As much as I have enjoyed the food, I am not sure I will return. I have worked in customer service for 20 years and am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Even though the temps are over 100 for what seems to be like 9 months a year these days, I always make time for the soup here.  Tea Light is only like 10 minutes from the office, and it is one of my favorites.  I've eaten here more times than I can count, and I always get the Chicken or Beef soup.  The soup broth is always so flavorful and robust.  I love that they bring you fresh herbs and bean sprouts to add it right at the last second.  It really makes the soup seem so fresh.  I know I shouldn't, but I always finish the broth.  it just seems too good to waste...    The spring rolls are a nice change of pace as well.  They aren't fried, and are packed with good stuff.  One of my co-workers always gets the Pork Ball sandwich, and I don't think you could pry it from his hands while eating it.  The people that run this restaurant are really friendly and always have a smile on their face.  The restaurant itself is tiny, so don't be discouraged if you cannot find a seat right away."}
{"text":"The pho was delicious (i got the beef) and of course, it was a generous serving size. It is a very cute environment with gorgeous tables. It's a neat place to go if you want an adventure. Also the Thai tea was an orange cup of deliciousness! I recommend going!"}
{"text":"I have never had pho... But my buddy Jesus eats it ALL the time! So when the team decided to try pho for lunch today, I was in! Get this... Didn't order pho! I asked the cashier what I should get. She compared pho to soup, and well... I don't like soup. So I ordered a chicken and rice noodle dish. It came with 2 egg rolls, and was delicious. I ordered a Taro Bubble Tea, too. I am pretty sure I can't eat again today, but it was delicious. They have three sauces on the table, too. I tried them all, and my favorite was the sweet almost plum sauce. Will definitely go back. Hidden gem, really."}
{"text":"Uh oh... Last two visits have been sub par. The noodles were gummy and seems something is off.  I always get #1 or #3 beef. #3 comes with egg rolls that are really good.  Seems having two locations is starting to put pressure on consistency. I hope my next visit is better."}
{"text":"Tea Lite has a simple menu of just a few items, clean food, and is an easy in and out dinner or lunch. I am a regular here, and go several times a month. I always get one of three things. First, the chicken salad, which is served with a super light dressing and is very clean, leaving you full but not feeling heavy. I also love the chicken pho and veggie spring rolls. And I ALWAYS have to compliment my meal with honeydew or mango boba or a green matcha tea (delicious). What I love about this place is that it is privately owned, and the owners are always there. It's small, and although it's busy around lunch hour, it is still fairly quiet and a nice place to sit and read a book while eating."}
{"text":"My review is only for the spring rolls which I got as take out.  I asked that tofu be used instead of shrimp.  They were $6.99 for 3.  Nice size and full of fresh greens and enough tofu.   I checked out their menu and plan to try their PHO.  I have had PHO in many places (worldwide) and I know what a good PHO is.  I will report on my adventure with PHO at Tea Light Cafe as soon as it happens."}
{"text":"I'm giving Tea Light Cafe an extra star (well deserved) for being an independent restaurant in the middle of corporate-eatery-Scottsdale. But rest assured, the food, value and experience merit a solid 4 stars if not higher. I dine here often and every meal has been spot on. Ethnic food is a staple of mine and Vietnamese dining is always a treat; I think it's healthier than other varieties, but what do I know. I'm still eating off value menus.  I've had the Pho several times, and it's very good; but I'm not a big Pho fan. It's soup. I don't care how big the bowl is... soup is not a meal. It's an appetizer. If I want a light meal, I order their Spring Rolls. They're loaded with shrimp and some other meat (I think it's pork) and the wrapping is see-through. I can see what's inside the roll.  I love them. Yes they are appetizers too, so if you follow my philosophy, they should not count as a meal either.  But they are shaped like hot dogs, which are a meal. Are you following this?  My favorite dish is \"The Number 3\" which is a huge bowl filled with rice noodles, grilled beef, lots of veggies and it's topped with an awesome egg roll. See the pic uploaded by Renick T. That's my dish and I'm sticking with it. This dish is featured at many Vietnamese establishments.  Tea Light does it very well. When I eat this dish, the entire world comes into balance and I feel an inner connection to the universe.  The Buddha statutes in the shop come to life and smile lovingly upon me, my meal, my table and my pals.  OOOOOHHHHHMMMMMM."}
{"text":"First, overall impressions are very good. This is a nice, simple, hole in the wall. It's a simple, friendly introduction to Vietnamese cuisine. It is what it claims to be - a \"Vietnamese Deli\". You order at the counter and your food is brought to you.   I had the Beef Pho which had a very nice broth (once I added the requisite amount of chili sauce - personal preference) with tasty meat and rice noodles. The amount of meat was a bit skimpy, but ok. My friend had the chicken salad which was basically a salad topped with grilled chicken meat, which was accompanied by a very tasty dressing. I had a nice green tea with pomegrenate that was very tasty. Didn't sample the Vietnamese Coffee as I didn't want to have a particularly late night. This is a place I'd come back to for a simple meal before or after a movie at the nearby Harkins Scottsdale 101.   Some of the possible negatives are price (a bit high, but heck it is Scottsdale, and the rent must be a small fortune at that shopping center), and the lack of choice.   Grades (a new tradition in my reviews)  Overall:  B  (there is only one grade for food, and nothing meriting an                        overall grade reduction) Service - No Grade - as there is no real table service here. Folks at the                  counter were nice though Food -     B - Above average. Good, fresh, simple Vietnamese food,                   albeit overpriced.  Drinks -  No Grade - as I didn't sample the Vietnamese Coffee, and                 no alcoholic beverages are served here."}
{"text":"There are only 3 words you need to say at this place: \"tea, light, special.\"   For soup lovers out there, this will not disappoint. One area which could be improved is the quality of the meat used (particularly the beef.) Prefer the chicken for this reason.   Overall, great food for a good price."}
{"text":"I visited Tea Light Cafe for the first time last night with a friend. I had been feeling under the weather all day and had been craving pho for a couple weeks. Adding the two together, I knew what had to be done.  Tea Light Cafe is tucked (almost hidden) between a large movie theater and a bunch of other mall-ish restaurant and department stores. You've got to be looking for it, or you're likely to miss it.  The parking lot is very large but even still, it took us a while to find a spot. Not sure why, to be honest. I ordered the beef pho, my friend ordered some kind of a grilled chicken dish, then we found a seat just outside the front door.  The view outside was beautiful: A Ferrari parked beside a BMW parked beside a Cadillac parked beside a Maserati. But enough about the cars - how was the food?  The pho was just what the doctor ordered, without a doubt. The warmth of the broth of pho has always been very comforting to me. Was this the best pho I'd ever eaten? Not necessarily. But I still enjoyed it very much.  My friend's chicken dish was beautifully presented, but appeared somewhat dry. She confirmed that it lacked a bit of character, but made do by mixing sauces and enjoyed it nonetheless.  Tea Light Cafe is not very close to where I live, but I would consider it worth the trip. It is rated pretty highly across hundreds of reviews, and I'd agree that its rating is well-deserved.  If you haven't been, and you're into Vietnamese food, I would recommend a visit. I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I first tried this place on a day I got some GREAT news, but I REALLY like Tea Light.  I've experienced the greatness that is Tea Light twice now and I can honestly say this place hits the spot in my world.  I am so happy to now have a go-to place for excellent take out, which is not your ordinary meal.  So far I've tried the beef pho, the chicken sandwich, the egg rolls, and the beef noodle bowl.  Everything was great!  I really liked the freshness of the chicken sandwich and the awesome sauce that came on it.  The pho is great and I love that it comes with everything you need to jazz it up on the side.  Since I am not a fan of cilantro, I was happy the second time that they honored my request to not put it in the soup... yay!  The egg rolls are crunchy deliciousness, which is a complement to any meal.    Basically what I am trying to say is I am thoroughly happy to have found this place- thank you yelp once again!"}
{"text":"Just a little place tucked away by the movie theater but well worth walking through the door. Always people inside which I take as a good sign. Friendly staff and fresh tasting food. The pho is great and I love t he spring rolls. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pho soup tastes like a combination of a generous scoop of salt, small cup of beef broth, and a msg bomb. Spring roll wrap was rubbery and chewy. Luckily the filling was fresh.  It's lucky for the restaurant that it is one of few choices if you want pho in the northern side of town. It is simply not remotely comparable to the Vietnamese restaurants in Tempe/Chandler."}
{"text":"We love this place. We often go there before or after a movie. The menu is simple, egg rolls, spring rolls, pho soup, and beef, chicken and port over noodles, or some combination of the above. Nothing elaborate, but its filling and seems healthy.   Everything we had was good, but I took off one star because their ordering isn't as easy as it should be. There are pictures of about 10 on the menu overhead, but you eventually learn there are more choices than this, and the menu overhead doesn't have the prices. Look at the takeout menu instead. Same stuff but better descriptions and with prices.   Most entrees are $7 to $10. Not the best bargain for some noodles and egg rolls, but OK for Scottsdale.  Overall a reliable place with good food, and good service. Once you learn the menu, its even better."}
{"text":"So this is the type of place where you order at the register, sit down, and they bring you the food. I agree that it caters to a different crowd than most pho places. If you actually try to ask for pho, they look at you quizically, like, \"soup?\"  I always get the chicken pho with tofu added. Their chicken is always tender, and always clean cuts. Maybe its just me but I dont like chewing on blood vessels. Never had that problem here. This is probably my number one reason for returning so many times. The pho is really good and they bring you your delicious iced coffee in a to-go cup. How convenient!  I only dinged a star because theyre pretty skimpy on the greens to add in, especially the basil compared to some other pho spots. I was sitting outside enjoying my pho when another patron asked the man if she could have more basil, and he literally said that he didnt have any more. Apparently they dont keep much on hand.  STILL, I love love love their pho and their quick, easy service and yummy coffee. Ive noticed they also have bahn mi & I will be giving it a try there."}
{"text":"Love this place b/c it reminds me of the amazing Vietnamese I could get in L.A.  I've been searching for it since I left and I have finally found the noodles, bbq beef, eggroll, cilantro and fish sauce combo I fell in love with the first time I had Vietnamese.  I can't say I've tried anything else on the menu b/c it's so dang good, I can't stray.  Since I was there two years ago, they've thrown a little money into the decor and it's turning out to be a pretty cute joint.  They also started doing fancy green teas, hot and cold and have made some menu additions that look tempting.  It's right next to the movie theatre and I go there any time I'm on that side of town.  I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Best recommendation to get: the tealight special, which includes 2 egg rolls, a spring roll and pho bowl. The food is fresh and the dipping sauces are great! The beef pho was decent, but the meat to noodle ratio was a bit off. I wish they put more meat :("}
{"text":"Pros: -Got the veggie pho to go, and it tasted heavenly. The broth had a lovely ginger taste and was nicely salty. I can see the broth potentially being too salty for some, but it was perfect at the time. -They separated the broth from the noodles/veggies in their own containers for takeout, which was very helpful for preserving the taste and quality of the pho. -They were generous on the green onion and cilantro, which are my favorite veggie add-ins to asian soups. -They seem to have some very interesting tea choices and tea-ware, like teapots and cups. Since we were getting takeout, we didn't try these options. There are several glass canisters of interesting looking teas to the left of the registers and if you so decide to try this place, I would give some of those teas a taste.  Cons: -A more expensive than other pho places with arguably competitive quality. Our total for 2 veggie phos and 2 boba drinks was a little under $27. However, it does seem to be pretty far from other cheaper and high quality alternatives (like the ones you  find near asian markets), so the price may just reflect the lack of neighboring competitors in this area. -The veggie pho option pretty much only came with tofu, regular onion, green onion, and cilantro, excluding your usual bean sprouts, mint, jalapeno that seem to come with every order of pho at most places. At other restaurants, they may include other veggies like broccoli, carrots, and peas or whatnot. It's not a big deal for me, because the pho was still delicious, but I think the price should be lower to reflect the scant ingredients? The veggie pho at the other aforementioned place was about $5-$6.  -The boba was very meh. The smoothie flavors tasted exactly like the fake-tasting powders you can buy at LeeLees and the boba was a little too rigid. The chewiness was still pretty good. Not the worst boba I had, but far from the best.  Verdict: I won't be coming back, mostly because this was an impromptu take out adventure on our way out of town for a road trip and there's no way this place is convenient for us to stop by again, but even if I was overcome with the desire to eat pho, I would go to places with cheaper, better pho and better boba. I'm not giving it a terrible review though because all I got was take out one time. Don't get me wrong, if you just don't have any other closer options for pho and don't mind paying the higher than average price, then this is a solid choice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I have been coming here for years, and have never had an experience that was less than stellar.  The pork chops frequent my dreams, the egg rolls combined with the fresh mint are incredible, and all the soups and sandwiches are great lunch options.  What makes this place so great? Well, first and foremost is the freshness of the ingredients.  Second is the simplicity of the menu, there are not a ton of options, but everything is excellent.  Third is the service; always friendly and efficient.    If there is one problem it is that seating can be limited during busy times, but that just speaks to how awesome this place is.  I have recommended Tea Light to many people and they have all loved it, so if you haven't tried it, you missing out."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and a great deal to boot. PLEASE put one in Gilbert!  Great service. Fast and really tasty. Place was packed for lunch.  Small but really good."}
{"text":"I'm vising from the Bay Area, where great Vietnamese places are on every street corner, and I've been searching for some local Vietnamese places for some time. I was VERY happy to find this place!  If there's one thing I don't like about Scottsdale, it is that most 'good food' places are way too fancy; I want 'holes in the wall' with stellar food and this place fit the bill.    I'll be back to try their sandwiches, but the Pho (soup) was a good start.  Everyone seemed to know the owners, who obviously take care of their clientel."}
{"text":"Good authentic, traditional Vietnamese spring rolls (that to me is the fried rolls) are few and far between with today's Vietnamese restaurants in the valley. This has been our favorite place to get spring rolls for years. The spring rolls at Tea Light Cafe are delicate and prepared to perfection. Served with heaping mounds of fresh lettuce, basil, mint and shredded carrots you just can't find a better spring roll in Scottsdale. Although a rare occurrence, we do order other items on the menu. The Pho soup is also very, very good along with their Vietnamese sandwiches, and main course meals. Thumbs up for Tea Light Cafe!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Pho in the valley!  You would never think this place in a strip mall next to the Harkins would have such authentic delish Pho!  Great prices, just wish it had more seating inside."}
{"text":"I was craving Bun with chicken and discovered this place via Yelp. Turns out it's about a mile from me which is a huge bonus. Their Bun totally hit the spot and I really liked the egg rolls. I just moved here from the Bay Area where Vietnamese is plentiful. TLC ranks up there with the good CA places I've eaten at.   The atmosphere of the place is warm and cute. Very clean. The owner was there and very nice. Took good care of my needs. You will be seeing me there on a regular basis :)"}
{"text":"I had okay service, nothing too outstanding. But, I really love a lot of their stuff. Their food is delicious and I've heard their pho is super great. Used to regular when I was over there more... I miss this treat"}
{"text":"I have nothing to compare this too as I've never eaten Vietnamese food ever. I've also never tried pho. Stopped here for lunch on a whim and it was delicious! The place was packed (good sign) and my husband and I got the sampler thing (pho, egg and spring roll). It was all yummy although we had no idea what to do with all the extra - the sauces and things that came on the side- we needed a tutorial! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far and I absolutely love it! The food is amazing and they have great service. They are very clean and friendly. I really haven't found many good Vietnamese places in Arizona, so I was really happy that somebody brought me here. If you go here, definitely get the #3 with beef--it is the best."}
{"text":"Food was great, staff was helpful, tiny shop was packed.  I had the Tea Light Special and spring rolls, bother were great.  Counter service, clean and well run.  If you have never tried Pho start here."}
{"text":"Delicious pho take out!! Great for a quick dinner on a Friday night! The chicken pho has only white breast meat which is nice and there are plenty of condiments, the cilantro is even already cleaned up nicely."}
{"text":"I Love Vietnamese food, and I used to come to the place a lot and the food was always great, but the place has really gone down hill. This last time the food was inedible and made me throw up after words. Before this experience I have never gaged after tasting food, but this place made me do that. The fresh spring rolls were anything but fresh and tasted so old that the inherited a soapy taste. Really hope the owners of this place step it up and bring it back to its former level. VERY DISAPPOINTED. If you want truly delicious Vietnamese try Saigon Bowl"}
{"text":"Pho is phantastic! 1 & 3 dishes are very flavorful and light.  Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Good food, great services, good people! Definitely give it a try! Pho, bun, rice! They got matcha tea, boba drinks, Thai tea, Vietnamese iced coffee. This is the real deal PHOSURE!"}
{"text":"Best chicken pho in Scottsdale in my opinion. Worth the wait during lunch or dinner. Good food all around. Give them a try you'll love them."}
{"text":"This place has the best pho and egg rolls! I am super picky about my food so I am glad I finally found a place that I love and can give good reviews to. I wish I live close to here so I can eat it everyday."}
{"text":"Great little place to grab lunch or Pho to go! My boyfriend and I come here often since it's not too far from our home. Definitely a place we go to weekly. We usually get the same thing every time we go and have not been disappointed. I'm hoping they add a few things to their menu..."}
{"text":"I over hyped myself for this place. For me to think think that I would have a decent boba tea within 2 miles of my new home...?   I got the frozen mango boba tea.  The flavor was decent but the texture was something else. There were ice chucks, big bobas, small bobas, hard bobas, and squishy bobas.   I know plenty of places that has good food but not so good boba, so I'll have to give their pho a try!"}
{"text":"As far as a variety of Vietnamese restaurants to choose from in North Scottsdale, there is none.  Just the fact that this place exists where it does warrants at least 1-star!  I've been here a few times and it is always good.  The menu is not very big...but everything I've had is always good.  It always bothers me though that they don't call their pho by its real name, or their sandwiches as banh mi.  But oh well, this is NoSco...have to cater to culturally inept folks.  I've had their beef pho, and it was decent.  Nothing to rave about from what I remember, but it definitely works.  I'll need to try it again to give a full report.  Recently I just tried their #7 \"Marinated Beef Sandwich\" (Banh Mi)...and it was delicious.  Thinly sliced, marinated pieces of beef (grilled), with lettuce, cilantro, shredded carrots, cucumbers, and a yummy mayo sauce.  I'm not as well versed with Banh Mi as I am with pho (im a \"pho-natic\" lol), but as far as my taste buds could tell....the sandwich was darn yummy.   The owners are always there and as others have said, are super nice.  Although I don't find it to be the most authentic Vietnamese place, definitely stop by this place if you enjoy Vietnamese food and need your quick fix."}
{"text":"I really like pho, but not just any pho. Tea Lite has a limited menu and only had 2 versions of pho, a beef or chicken version. I had the beef version and I even though they are a trek for me, I will be back. The broth was complex, had wonderful depth and the beef and meatballs were very good. It is delish. I also ordered the Grilled Pork Chops and the Marinated Grilled Beef to go. Even though I reheated for dinner, they were both very tasty. I'm sure even more so if I sat and ate at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Pho only and no other items on the menu that pop out.  Overpriced and nothing to make you go wow. I guess I should have noticed the place was empty at lunch time."}
{"text":"This review is only for the Boba Tea. We came with high expectations seeing that it was highly reviewed. We also selected Tea Light because it was the only shop that served bubble tea in the area of Scottsdale that was convenient to our location. I never fault a shop for having a small selection of bubble tea because I imagine that they are trying to serve up their signature flavors (coconut, Thai tea,  honeydew melon, taro and watermelon). I was really looking forward to my dessert libation after a great meal.  However, these hopes were dashed when I tasted my taro Boba tea. The drink was slushie and thin tasting. The most offending point was the bubbles were semi frozen and hard to consume. My friend also had the same experience. It was a deflating experience.  While I sipped, I watched them grill pork and beef. They were creating a lovely char and the smells wafting were enticing. So maybe, when I do come back, I will skip the tea and try a meal.    Tip: Tea Light Cafe is tucked in a corner in the middle of the Harkins Theater shopping complex. Note that their unit number is 1084. It is on the same side as the theater, but you have to look and see if the numbers are increasing or decreasing."}
{"text":"Matcha green tea costs $6 a glass.  What?!  Rip off.  For lunch I ordered the number #3 Bun w/ beef.  Literally was a few pieces of beef and the rest was all noodles.  I probably will be back to try their Pho soup.  But that's it."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town! This cafe is my go to for excellent pho. Location is quaint, clean and the customer service is always impeccable. The beef pho is killer, I can't get enough!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  This is a terrific alternative to the \"look alike\" restaurants in Scottsdale.  It is not fancy, meaning there are no white table cloths and the like, but the food is so good and light (and very well portioned)!  The service is friendly and good.  I had to grab my own drinks and silverware, but the table was cleared immediately when I finished.  And the price is right on!"}
{"text":"Delicious pho and amazing bubble tea served promptly with kindness. Drove out of my way as a business traveler and I am 100% coming back again. This is an excellent option for lighter Vietnamese fare."}
{"text":"Tea Light Cafe is a great restaurant, no doubt about it.  The only reason for not ticking in at five stars is because of the lack of depth to the menu.  Other than that, the food is impeccable, owners are extremely friendly and the decor and seats always accommodate.    I always order the same thing here, the chicken pho.  I grab a table next to the wall and proceed to wait approx three minutes for that cart to come rolling out of the kitchen with various goodies, all for my consumption!  The huge bowl of soup that arrives, steaming all the way to your table, has a fantastic aroma.    I highly recommend hitting this place up after you see a movie in the theater next door."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pho restaurant in North Scottsdale area. The broth is tasty and the service is very good. Prices are reasonable. It can be quite busy at times but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Delicious food and \"special perk \"owner blends exotic teas for traditional medicinal purposes."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Quality materials, phenomenal flavors - everything to love.  It has a nice mom & pop feel despite being in a strip shopping center in Scottsdale.  It's hard to decide between the beef noodle dish with eggrolls and the sandwiches - so I rarely choose - I just get both and take it home.  This is the kind of place where you order extra to have for later!"}
{"text":"As would be expected for a Vietnamese restaurant, this one has tasty, inexpensive food and fast service. No need to wait to be seated; upon entering, you order at the counter and then choose a table and seat yourself. It is smaller than most Vietnamese eateries and has a shorter menu, but the service is friendlier and there is a pleasant outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"This is a very nice Vietnamese restaurant where they serve good food. It's conveniently located within walking distance of the movie theatre! I wished it was open on Sundays, though. I ordered the chicken pho and I thought it was delicious. Yes, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a great little place. So glad I discovered it. It is a small restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere. The food is fresh, well cooked, authentic, and delicious. The service is good and the staff friendly. The gentleman who takes the orders is always ready to offer menu suggestions. The relatively small menu makes it easy to try a wide variety of the restaurant's dishes in only a few visits. I have eaten here four times now and have never been disappointed. For those new to the restaurant and unfamiliar with Vietnamese Cuisine I would recommend the Tea Light Special - two egg rolls, Pho soup, a spring roll, sauces and garnishes. The egg rolls are delicious, crispy, light and flavorful. How they manage to put so many delicious flavors into the delicate Pho amazes me. I look forward to visiting again soon. BTW, it always makes me wonder when Yelp reviewers give a restaurant a bad review simply because they're too stupid to find its location. It's a reflection on the reviewer and not the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fast service, clean facility. But...  * Rice noodles in my chicken pho are gummy.  * Bean sprouts are brown / old. Hard to believe a Vietnamese place does not have fresh bean sprouts.  * Chicken in pho IS NOT FRESH. It's processed. Bad form.  * Tiny plate of the traditional side veggies.  Feels skimpy.  I expect more for an eight-dollar bowl of soup."}
{"text":"Had the best chicken sandwich in the valley, really popular item.  But mysteriously they've now stopped making sandwiches.  Pho and grill are great, but I'm traumatized by this puzzling loss.  Maybe they just want to be a pho bar now?"}
{"text":"Having grown up in LA, I'm used to seeking out local Vietnamese places for a pho fix. My bf and I found this place on Yelp and tried it out for the first time a few weeks ago. We both ordered the Tea Lite Special which included one pho entree, a spring roll, and two egg rolls. The beef was good and the broth itself really made the pho delicious. I also enjoyed the egg rolls, but I will probably skip the spring roll next time.  The place was busy, but we had no problem ordering and our food arrived in 15 minutes. The egg rolls and spring roll came out even sooner. Plenty of seating with indoor and outdoor tables.  Good customer service, fair prices, and delicious iced tea! What more can you ask for in a quick and easy lunch spot."}
{"text":"WOW what a place!!! We came during the holidays (that weird timeframe between Christmas and New Years) and it was still packed!   Service is fantastic, incredible kind friendly and professional especially Anthony. The actual physical space is very small and intimate, they have about 6-8 tables to sit outside when the weather isn't hot.   The food was amazing. Roughly $10 per dish and simple menu of about 6 options. I tried my aunts and my dads and loved theirs including mine! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I used pass this place every time I went to the movies or to get my nails done next door.  My husband loves vietnamese food, so he had been there a couple of times.  Finally I agreed to go with him before a movie.  I am hooked on the shredded chicken sandwich.  A great combination of veggies (carrots, cucumber, sprouts) and very well seasoned chicken on a crunchy baguette.  My husband had the pho.  I am not big on soups, so I tasted his, I could actually eat that next time, although I have been to this place and I feel like a broken record, I always have the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am Vietnamese and I have been to VN. This place is quick service Viet, catered to the taste of PHX / Scottsdale residents."}
{"text":"The pho is just average. I have had much, much better. I also am not really sure of the quality of their meats. Kind of sketchy. The service is not great either for what you pay. There are much better places in town to get good pho so do not waste your time here, honestly. Sorry, 1 star, not impressed."}
{"text":"We love the Tea Light Cafe! We are here at least one a week. Their pho is amazing and an incredible way to boost the immune system! Their bun is a favorite along with the iced coffee.  Chris, his family and team are wonderful and we appreciate their gracious hospitality."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love this place. The food is always fresh the portions are extraordinarily large and the price is amazing. The staff there is always sweet and kind."}
{"text":"AWESOME chicken soup!  We order it all of the time.  Try this restaurant. The food is excellent.  Great place for lunch and when weather is nice they have a nice outside dining area."}
{"text":"Love new owners of scottsdale AND sedona location! If you want great authentic Vietnamese than this is the place!"}
{"text":"Had take out pho (beef) last night, and my friend had the chicken bun.  Just excellent again, and now I'm left wondering why I'm not eating here more frequently than once a month.  The pho broth is consistently excellent, and the beef was served very well, including a well packaged piece of rare beef, as pho should be served.  The ingredients' freshness was superb.  If I didn't mention it before, the packaging, other than being environmentally bad, is very convenient.  My friend reports his chicken bun was pretty excellent.     Anyway--five stars for excellent vietnamese take out.  You should be eating here."}
{"text":"My new favorite place.  This place is sooooooooooo (is that enough \"o's\" for you?) good!  I come here every chance that I get.  There isn't anything that I've ordered here that I wouldn't order time and time again.  Whenever we have friends come out to visit- this place is a must :)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. It's sooo good. It's so good you'll have a battle between your stomach (which will get full and want you to stop eating) and your mouth that will cherish every bite and want you to keep going. I really love the food here"}
{"text":"Not ideal for a vegetarian and average at best.  After reading the reviews on yelp I thought I'd give it a try. We arrived and it was super busy so I felt reassured that this was going to be good.. Yeah not so much.  As we waited for our meals we noticed that other diners were picking pieces of meat and sitting it to the side.   As our meals arrived we realized why. As for the vegetarian soup it consisted of broth and noodles.  To end on a positive note, the green tea and coffee were amazing"}
{"text":"I am so in love with their chicken pho! Its the best I've had so far! I get takeout sometimes because it is right near work. FYI-Picking up to go is really hard on weekends because of the lack of parking due to the movie theater and other businesses."}
{"text":"Just stop reading reviews and GO THERE NOW! Absolutely delicious food and great customer service. You'll be raving about this place to all your peers and definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Heard this was one of the best pho places in the valley? Mystery meat soup. What the hell did I just eat? I love pho but this place is a hard no."}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelp for helping me find this delicious restaurant in Scottsdale.   They offer good pho! You can get 2 spring rolls, 2 egg rolls, and a pho for under $10 for lunch. The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  It can get very crowded due to the small space inside. However, on a nice day, you can enjoy your meal on the patio. This place is popular and busy...order first, find a seat next. The atmosphere is great!  They don't give out order numbers, but instead someone passes your table with a cart of food and asks you what you ordered. Remember what you ordered! Once you tell the guy, he'll hand you your meal.  Try this place the next time you are in the mood for pho and are in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a solid choice for a reasonably priced lunch and I love eating pho outside on a patio; there is just something about the contrast of warm pho and a cool breeze.   The pho itself is okay, but I've had better. As a result of most of the clientele that eat here, Tea Light plays it safe and does not serve traditional phos with tripe, rare beef and such. Over my years of eating pho, I've really become fond of the amount of flavor those pieces bring to the soup, and I can definitely taste a difference. Do not get me wrong though, Tea Light embraces their style and provides pho that is light and very refreshing. Their Tea Light special comes with with a smaller bowl of pho (chicken or beef), egg rolls and a spring roll - more than enough food to fill you up, but not enough to bring you down. When going there, I'd have to recommend that (if you're hungry), the Banh Mi selecion or the bún with egg rolls.   The staff at Tea Light is always fantastic (so fantastic that they earn an extra star for it) and they will remember your face if you're a regular. Also their teas are pretty good as well, and I'm talking about the packaged kind that they sell for brewing. Be sure to check this place out if you're in the area and need a healthy bite to eat, especially as the weather gets cooler!"}
{"text":"Great Pho. Always pleasant staff and consistent quality. Prices are a little steep considering the cuisine, but the location is obviously the reason why. Small dining room, that can be hard to get a group of more than 2 into at peak times. Highly recommended, but if your on a budget split a bowl. Trust me, theres plenty."}
{"text":"I like this place for a quick fix. Love the bbq with noodles/rice, eggrolls are ok but I do love the spring rolls. The only issue I have are the boba drinks, they are not very good at all. I wish they would figure it out because if their boba drinks were better, I'd buy a drink daily, seriously! But I do like the place a lot and I think the new owners are really nice."}
{"text":"Veggie  Pho has no veggies just sayin.. Taste bland really average at best.. I really can't say much other than average all the way around...."}
{"text":"Tea lite cafe is a hidden gem! We've lived  across the street for a couple of years and we have finally tried it! Atmosphere is small, simple, and vibrant. Even though the place was super packed, service was quick. If you're pushed on time I recommend pick up. The chicken pho was tasty and had great flavor. It has jalepenos so it is a  little spicy. The marinated beef on rice noodles was so good! The meat was tender and had a sweeter/BBQ marinade. The only thing I would say is the meat to soup/noodles ratio is low. Next time I would pay the extra for more meat! I will be going back to try the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place from friends and now I am really questioning their palettes! The Pho was very sub par. Not a large portion at all for a $7.95 price tag. They served it with wilted old cilantro and about 12 bean sprouts...no basil. The manager said they were all out of basil in the state of Arizona. The shrimp and pork fried eggrolls for $5.95? Horrible. 3 pieces cut into half served with two small pieces of lettuce and old cilantro and 1 sprig of mint. It's like they don't keep their veggies in a cooler. There is much better Vietnamese food in the city, try Pho Tanh and Maxim, both in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Try the marinated pork chops. I am hungry as I am writing about them. The combination of rice, side salad and pork chops is a good one. And surprisingly they are generous with the portion. Me like it!"}
{"text":"I totally dig this place because it has some tasty broth for the Pho. I was super confused on how to order and the menu and all that but in the end I just ended up with a bowl of Pho, which was fine with me!  The broth was so good I really didn't have to add anything to it.   I went in at about 12:45PM. This seems like a place that a lot of people that work in the area go to. The staff was very friendly to everyone and I think that everyone else in there was a local.   Pretty good and is going on my list!   Oh and to find a Pho place that has a soda fountain machine is rare! Other places usually just give you a can of soda. Not this place. Fountain all the way!  I'd go back, for sure."}
{"text":"This place is so so yummy! I always crave it when I want a delicious meal that is also helps me get over a weekend of too much drinking and eating. Their veggie ginger broth Pho is the best because it doesn't have the added sugar. Just add chicken or rare beef to it and you are all set."}
{"text":"My go to place rain or shine ! All their pho is awesome and the broth smells/taste fresh. Cleanest pho  place I been to in the valley. Their soups come with a side plate of water sprouts, basil leaves, and fresh lemon juice. You get a Big Bang of flavor for 9bucks , also be sure to try their peanut sauce!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Pho.   Go now, try the chicken or beef Pho, and get a side of spring rolls.   The. Best. Ever!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff great food! The Pho is great for first timers and the Pho lunch special is hard to beat. Also love their #3, noodles, egg roll and beef. And cant say enough about their porkchops.  It can get busy at lunch but the outdoor seating is great when the weather isn't scorching."}
{"text":"Absolutely unimpressed with my latest visit today. I made an over the phone order for some spring rolls, and I was told a five minute wait. I got there and the food was indeed ready, but when I went to the counter to pay, the 10 year old boy (I know this is a family owned establishment but come on..) charged me $10 and change for a menu item that is advertised at $6.99. I asked the boy if this was correct and he said yes. So I paid for my three dramatically overpriced spring rolls and left. Once I got in the car and looked at the order they were completely wrong... Expecting the spring rolls to be the traditional vietnamese spring rolls with shrimp and pork, they were some sort of dark meat, messily wrapped concoction that is nothing similar to what was expected or what they have served there in the past. Buyer beware.."}
{"text":"2.5 to 3.0 stars but i'm feeling generous so i'm going to rate up.  I've been here 4x-5x to satisfy a pho or banh mi craving and each time I leave feeling a little unsatisfied even though I know not to expect much.    Pros - 1 of 3 Vietnamese restaurants in the N. Phoenix/N. Scottsdale area - Small, locally-owned business - Safe intro to vietnamese cuisine   Cons - Lack of choices/competition in the vicinity keeps the food standards     set to mediocre - Atypical pho menu:  beef version omits tendon, tripe, and different     slices of beef - Where's the meat? Skimpy with the meat in pho  - 3 ham banh mi (sub) should have 3 types of pork not 2.  Otherwise call it a 2-meat sub.   - Subs don't have the standard offerings like daikon radish or peppers  - Pricey. $7.25 for pho and $5 for banh mi.  Yes, for those that aren't    familiar $5 is high as it is double what other places charge.  this is what a vietnamese sub should look like: http://www.chow.com/assets/2009/07/pork_pate_banh_mi_sandwich_600.jpg"}
{"text":"Worth everything you pay here.  I used to drive about 7 miles for Pho, but now I come here, less than a mile away for my fix.  I love to order the beef special with rare beef, brisket, and beef balls to go.  Their broth is really clear.  Their egg rolls are really good as well.  Worth the try if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"With all the great reviews, maybe my expectations were too high, but the food was mediocre at best. The menu is limited, and it doesn't feel like I'm eating out there. I like the experience of eating out, and there wasn't much here. It was just odd to me."}
{"text":"Delicious. We had beef bun, spring rolls and beef phô. Nice little place to stop for quick dinner before the movies - conveniently next door."}
{"text":"Came here during lunch to get my Pho fix. This place has good, friendly service and a nice outdoor seating area with umbrella shades. I ordered the fresh spring rolls and beef pho. Both were good but not the best I've ever had. The spring rolls must have been prepared much earlier in the day, the rice wrapping was very dry and leathery. The beef pho had a nice broth, plenty of meat and noodles. I wish it had come with more herbs in the side. Overall, this is a good Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the Pho, but they could use a little better quality chicken.  Still delicious!"}
{"text":"I eat here probably 2-3 times a week (yes, I know I have a problem).  Food is affordable and delicious.  Love it"}
{"text":"Got a dinner to go at the Tea Light Cafe last night and was really impressed.  The chicken pho is delicious and comes with the toppings (noodles, chicken, cilantro, etc) on the side.    We tried the chicken and the beef bahn-mi which weren't completely authentic but really good sandwiches regardless.  Overall, really liked the food.  Only mistake was to try and pick it up on a Friday night around 7pm.  The parking lot was filled with movie-madness."}
{"text":"It's date night and you're headed to the movies. Now the dilemma. Eat a small mountain of hot, faux-buttered popcorn at the movies, or a little popcorn and a  decent meal afterward. I go with both. Only I'm usually too full to eat anything of decent substance after all that popcorn so I typically come here. Tea Lite Cafe.  It's cheap and filling and, its under ten bucks. I've tried both the chicken based pho and the beef, go with the beef...it has a ton more flavor. Another bonus is how the meat in the soup is all very recognizable, putting that whole dog and cat meat thing to rest.  A large bowl will feed two. I weasel most of the meat out of it when my date goes to the bathroom.  And she wonders why I fart so much."}
{"text":"Fast service great food.. The broth in the pho is as good as it gets.. It's tucked away by the movie theater but it's a gem.. Very fresh very good.. Try the mango boba.."}
{"text":"Tea Light Cafe has been one of our few go-to eateries that has been consistent and dependable in providing us with meals that are delicious and satisfying.  We've tried just about everything and love each and every dish. Whenever I have the sniffles, I want their Pho that comes with the freshest condiments. Their broth is so flavorful all on its own but blends beautifully to all the condiments.  My personal favorite is the grilled marinated pork/pork chops. Whether it's served with rice or on vermicelli, it's a win! The finished product after grilling is just amazing with its sweet & savory marinade caramelized to perfection. This will have you craving for more again and again."}
{"text":"A tip of the hat, make that a Non La, to these folks and to Vietnamese food in general.  The perfect place for a quick and filling lunch that's easy on the old wallet and gentle on my diet."}
{"text":"I love pho and this is one of only a few places that make it right every single time. My coworkers and I love this spot. Everything on their menu is delicious including their spring rolls!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Tea Lite Cafe for their Beef Pho for the past several years ...   I believe that they may be one of the only Pho spots in N Scottsdale...?  So, they definitely fill the void in the market place.  It is located in the plaza across from Whole Foods in the faaaar northeast corner of the plaza ... East of the movie theatre.    The owners/management here are kind pleasant individuals.  In the several years that I have come here they have only goofed up my order a few times, so their service is fairly consistent for the most part.  There Pho is not the best that I have ever had, but it's very good for N Scottsdale standards. They use fresh ingredients; on a few occasions I have gotten some mint leaves that were starting to go bad, and some of the meat was very fatty, but I am a reasonable person, and I understand that these things happen from time to time.  The facility itself is very clean, modern looking, and it's a relaxed atmosphere.  They do have pretty expansive hours of operation, which is very convenient if you work later into the evening - it's very nice to be able to call in and order on my way home.    Overall, I've never had a bad experience here, and their Pho is pretty good and their price points are reasonable for this area of N Scottsdale, so they deserve a solid 4 star rating. I have recommend my patients, family, and friends to come here and try it out for themselves!"}
{"text":"Excellent little place in North Scottsdale to get Pho! Try the tea light special. So much food for like 8 bucks. You get to try two of the rolls and pho. The best part of this lovely little place is that there are vegan versions of everything. We also got the matcha, good but not really worth the $6 price tag. I know quality matcha is expensive but for the amount of matcha we received I'd simply rather buy my own. Besides that, everything else was perfect! The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere clean. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome food every time.  I've tried several places for pho around Phoenix, Scottsdale and Paradise Valley and this is by far my favorite.  You can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients.  Yum."}
{"text":"Torn whether or not to make this review or keep this more secret. This is one of the best deals in Scottsdale, perhaps all of the greater Phoenix area. In my opinion Costco hotdog and drink good!   The Tea Lite Special (dine-in only) is a small pho, one summer roll and two spring rolls along with all the dressings for $9.99! I'm totally floored at how much food for the money you get here. Plus the choice of beef, chicken or shrimp pho, wow.  I'll be back for sure, maybe tomorrow...  Summer roll shell is soft and had a half shrimp. Their peanut sauce could be peanuttier...is that a word?  Spring roll are nice and crispy with standard pork and vegetable filling. Comes with a lettuce leaf and cilantro if you like to wrap them.  The sauce is a standard fish sauce with sugar. Not super sweet so a plus. The cucumber and lightly pickled carrots are a good touch.   Pho comes with a good size piece of basil, bean sprouts, a couple slices of jalapeños and a wedge of lime. I chose the beef version and it came with rate beef as well as meatballs.  Broth was not overly oily or salty.   Maybe, shrimp pho tomorrow...they have boba too..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho house. Its very ordinary pho and other dishes. Only one thing i dislike is they using no filter water."}
{"text":"in from out of town but every time we are in phoenix (every 3 months) we come at least twice in less than a week great food it's a must if you are in the area and I'll bet you'll be back"}
{"text":"Tea Lite Cafe's offers a quick and delicious meal. Located in the same complex as the Harkins 101 Theater, Babies-R-Us and several other large shops. Tea Lite offers a nice meal option for shoppers and business people alike. I recently visited with Gabi M, who is an expert (in my eyes at least) when it comes to Vietnamese cuisine and luckily I was with her to guide me through the menu. I wanted to get a full taste of Tea Lite Cafe, so we ended up ordering the Tea Lite Special which comes with spring rolls, egg rolls and Pho (choice of chicken or beef). This is absolutely the way to go, especially if you're a first timer! It provided a nice variety and was large enough to share. It's also very inexpensive and less than $9 for the entire dish! I thoroughly enjoyed the Pho and added hot sauce and the various spices.    There's not much to say about the atmosphere because there isn't much to the cafe. It feels like a cafe that you'd find in the busy streets of a big city. It's casual, clean and they featured pictures of the menu items on the wall. The service is incredibly fast too! We barely got our drinks and sat down and our food was already being served! It's perfect for a busy lunch hour.   The owner was very friendly and helpful during our ordering process. We ordered a decent amount of food and after our meal, I decided that I wanted to try a BOBA because I had never had one before. However, I only had a credit card and they have a $5 limit. The owner was so nice that he ended up just giving me the BOBA because I had already ordered so much. It showed their level of customer service and his gesture went a long way. Meow, what are you waiting for? It's time for you to visit for lunch!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch one day after getting a massage and I had the Chicken Pho and tea and it was AWESOME! Now I know why the place was packed!!! I will for sure be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out on a trip to scottsdale for a conference. I didn't have the pho but had the Bun thit nuong cha gio...which was pretty good. It is what I expected from the dish. Vermicelli, nicely marinated grilled pork, a plethora of veggies and nicely fried chunky pork eggrolls. It is in the classic vietnamese style..nothing strange about it (I have had this at places that use spring mix, and pineapple slices...weird). I called in, and picked up..it was all very efficient. Portion was large and equally distributed among components.   I'd come back if I were back in town. Not THE best viet place, but a good go to place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over a year now and the food has always been consistent and fresh. The broth of the pho has always been one of my favorites and the marinated beef Bahn mi (vietnamese sandwich) is out of this world. It's very easy to feed 2 people, a filling meal and healthy meal for less that $20.  I've noticed that the place has definitely more customers now so that tells me that the cafe is doing something right. The service is always quick, kind and mindful.  I will always be a customer as long as they are in business.."}
{"text":"Love Tea Lite but will now frequent much less.  Why, because they stopped making one of the best sandwiches on the planet.  As of about a week ago, we were told by the person running the counter that they have stopped making their version of the Banh Mi, which is a great chicken sandwich.  Was told it was too difficult to make.  Why you would take the item off of the menu that Phoenix Magazine listed as one of the 20 best sandwiches in the city doesn't make sense.  Bring it back!"}
{"text":"Great pho, great service, everyone is always smiling!! I make a trip at least once a week-even when it's hot-to satisfy my pho cravings. And the egg rolls are to die for!"}
{"text":"Very good Pho, and very healthy place too. Will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Shrimp spring rolls had too much rice paper making it a bit gooey and stiff. Sauce was too watery.  Overall,  just so so,  compared to my regular places in Chandler. . Will come back to try the pho."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem for foodies.  The ambiance is bistro-like, the food is of highest quality, and the place is always clean unlike many other Vietnamese restaurants.  The prices are very fair for the quality of food you get.  This ranks high on my list of the best places to eat here in the Valley.  Make sure to ask about the teas.  This place has the best tea in the Valley.  The Macha tea is a real healthy kick-starter and tastes so refreshing. Yummie!"}
{"text":"I had walked near this place so many times when going to the movie theater, but never thought to try it until my sister did and gave a rave review! Went here for dinner and thought that the food was reasonably priced and tasted good. The restaurant is pretty small, a lot of the tables were taken when we went around 7pm. The restaurant was clean and nice though. The service was very fast, which was great!  I ordered the Tea Light Special, vegetarian style. This was nice way to sample a few different things. It came with pho, two eggrolls, and a spring roll. I had never tried pho before, but I love noodles and soup so I enjoyed it. The spring roll wasn't great, the wrapping was a bit too chewy for my liking. The eggrolls were pretty god, not the best, but they were tasty! My friend got a dish with pork and rice I believe, I don't remember exactly what it was called, he enjoyed it but thought the portions were too small. I wasn't too filled up from my meal either, probably a better place for a lighter lunch versus somewhere to go when you're starving!"}
{"text":"Great food with friendly and fast service. They have a few gluten free options and everything is dairy free. I would highly recommend Tea Lite!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Sebastian (The Little Mermaid) - Kiss the Girl)  Steam Rice Plates! Egg Rolls! Words!  There you see it Sitting there across the desert It doesn't have a lot to serve But there's something about Pho And you don't know why But you're dying to try You wanna taste the Tea Lite Café... (Sebastian from the Little Mermaid - Kiss the Girl)  Tea Lite Café is nestle in the Scottsdale plaza off Scottsdale Road and the 101; west of the Harkin's Theater. This little gem serves up traditional Vietnamese cuisine on the North side of Scottsdale, which was rare back in the early 2000s when I moved to Phoenix. Vietnamese food was hard to find back then, but now it's starting to pop up everywhere since Pho is fast becoming a popular dish.  When I first visited this joint back in the early 2000s, they had their Pho called beef Noodle Soup instead. I gather it was a way to better explain to the public what Pho really was. Now it's back to Pho and it taste much better too! Yah! Aside from Pho, Tea Lite Café serves up some of my classic favorites Bun Mi sandiwhced, vermicelli bowls, and steam rice plates. Voted best sandwich by Phoenix Magazine back in 2010, their specialty sandwiches, also know as Bun Mi, will not disappoint.  Moreover, it is not to imply the rest of their dishes will disappoint, cause I definitely recommend their vermicelli bowls with your choice of meats; beef, chicken, or pork. Also known as, Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio, it comes along with egg rolls and served a top of fresh carrots, cucumbers, bean sprouts and cilantros. One thing I love about Vietnamese cuisine is the utilization of fresh vegetables and seasonings like cilantro giving it a distinctive scent. Vietnam is heavily Buddhist thus having a strong vegetarian background and the usage of vegetables along with their cuisine.  I'm not sure who the Chef is, but she seemed very friendly and came out to speak to the patrons. Some of the regulars seem to enjoy her company a lot. The waiter was very stiff and seemed like he was mad all the time - reminded me of my dad haha! (Sorry pops!) The place itself is cute and tiny. It was somewhat cluttered, but I enjoy that closeness to be able to see and speak to other patrons. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the banh mi sandwich ... and of course, boba! Who doesn't love boba tea? My faves are honeydew and watermelon."}
{"text":"They won't sell Tealight Special as take-out.  Why?  \"It's smaller portion\".   Fine, can I get the soup and order just one spring roll?  \"No, I can't sell you just one,\" he spits at me like I'm total idiot scum.  Wtf, you make them one at a time and would do it if I were dining in. There are literally no other customers so what's the inconvenience.  At least be nice and give a proper explanation, I'm ordering for my sick wife for goodness sake - I'm not a homeless beggar.  F* this place and their disregard for customer service.  The chicken soup is too salty as well."}
{"text":"Doing Keto and really felt like Pho.  Ordered the beef pho with out noodles.  Turned out awesome and surprisingly filling.  Didn't even miss the noodles.    This will be my go to place when I feel like pho without the carbs."}
{"text":"wow.  the reviews for this place are hard to comprehend.  i guess this is a case of phoenix-area residents having no basis for comparison.  the pho here is not good at all.  in fact, this did not even qualify as pho in my mind.    instead, the \"beef pho\" was really just weak beef broth that tasted like it was made from a mixture of powdered beef broth and hot water (or just a heated up can of beef broth), rice noodles, and a couple pieces of flavorless beef.    it lacks ALL of the distinctive flavors that define pho.  maybe they can't get those ingredients in AZ -- but then why try to open a pho restaurant?!?!?  i have been to numerous pho restaurants in places with large vietnamese communities (i.e. san jose and orange county) and i've had quite a bit of bad pho before.    but this place was by far the worst.  so bad in fact, that i cannot even call it pho.   i won't bother reviewing the spring and egg rolls.  they were awful.   the staff seemed friendly enough, so that earns them the one star, otherwise i would want to give them none (and yelp should allow that option!).    if the staff/owner is reading this, i realize my review is harsh, but i have to be honest.  i appreciate your attempt to bring pho and other vietnamese food to the valley, but this is really just a disgrace.  you are introducing hundreds of people to these kind of food and that is an enormous responsibility.  please do it right."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. The beef pho is soooo tasty as is the beef sandwich. Why they dont have the bacon sandwich [Banh-mi] is beyond me. It's a little more than I'd like to pay for Vietnamese, but it's worth it. I have been twice and everything has been great. The egg rolls were a pleasant surprise as well. Definitely a place I'll be back to. Owner is a not a talker or smiler but does have an awesome metal cart on which he toodles your food out to you. Awe-some!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beef noodle bowls. The beef is perfectly charred and delicious. My only complaint is that the staff isn't always super friendly and sometimes the wait is a bit much."}
{"text":"I've been to Tea Lite Cafe a couple of times over the years, with my most recent visit today when I went for lunch with Lindsey F.  TLC may not look like much from the outside, (it sits in a far corner of a strip mall and it's got a tiny little storefront and sign), but it's a fast-casual concept with moderate prices, friendly service, and pretty good Vietnamese food too!  I'm a huge Vietnamese fan, so it's always a difficult decision when it comes to ordering, but TLC's menu is short and sweet.  Highlights include the Spring Rolls and Pho.  If dining in, I recommend going with the Tea Lite Special which allows you to sample one spring roll, two egg rolls and your choice of chicken or beef pho soup for just $8.99.  I love all of the sauces they serve from fish sauce, hoisin, siracha, and more; I enjoy mixing them all together!  TLC also offers boba, which I love but have yet to try it since I'm typically pretty full after demolishing my meal, but I will be back soon next time the boba craving hits!"}
{"text":"Great Pho soup. No msg and really fresh ingredients.  We also had the vegetable spring rolls. Excellent flavor we will be regulars."}
{"text":"I only give this place 4 stars because I am not sure who to compare it to. I have not branched out and found other convenient Pho places near me since I moved to the Valley 2 years ago. This place is right near my work, and I can get in and out for lunch in well under an hour. It is a 'mom and pop' place and the owners are always manning the register or serving the food. I like that. I have had both the chicken and the steak Pho, and the steak kind of turned me off. The beef looked very unsavory and didn't taste great, but the chicken is always good and never too dry. All in all, a good place to try."}
{"text":"Yay!!!! I've finally found a decent Vietnamese restaurant in North Scottsdale.  I had the PHO (customized the way I like it) and a sandwich.  Both were really good!  Very reasonably price and the service couldn't be faster.  I just wish they had a bigger menu but they have the basics so I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Tealight is one of those places  that leaves you longing for \"more\".   Chicken Pho, was flavorful as usual but a bit on the cold side which left me dismayed as I was truly in need of something warm and flavorful to comfort my soul on this cloudy and winter like day. The heaping amounts of fresh bean sprouts, thai basil, seedless jalapeno slices, and lime wedges were enough to pardon the lack of proper broth temperature. (I'm somewhat forgiving)   Start off your meal off right with an order of the  crispy egg rolls! Wrap them in a lettuce leaf that it's served upon and, nestle that little bundle in the lovely clear like fish sauce and reminisce about_______. (Sigh)     They also have a nice selection of herbal teas that are served table side in charming little cast iron teapots. Reasonably priced and enough to share with a friend/spouse.   The tables are kept clean, and always loaded with hoisin sauce, red chili sauce...and the unequivocal sriracha (pardon my spelling). (Remember, when I said I was forgiving? Yeah, we'll it's reciprocal)   Return to the Tealight Cafe...you must...you shall!!"}
{"text":"May not be \"authentic\" Vietnamese, but that doesn't mean it's not terrific. Went back today and had the Tealight Special - a good size bowl of Chicken Pho, a spring roll (shrimp, noodles and veggies in a rice wrapper) and two small pork & veggie eggrolls. Dipping sauces add just the right balance of sweet, sour and salty. The fresh basil is the perfect addition to the Pho -- love to rip it up and add it all into the bowl. So fragrant. Good, good stuff. A big, tasty change-of-pace lunch for about $9.00. All good."}
{"text":"HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED: \"They\" say there is a first time for everything. And there is also a last time. Today was probably both times for me at the Tea Light Cafe.   After ordering our food, we were presented with the option of eating outside in 100+ Degree temperatures or waiting for someone to clean the only 4 top table open. We elected the latter of the 2 options. After patiently waiting for someone to clean the table I finally cleaned it myself. Ok. Not too bad but not what I expected.   Our food came out lightening fast!  As I took the first bite of my egg roll, I was in heaven!  It was delicious. Next, I took a bite of my beef and it was ice cold. I asked my wife how hers was and she said cold. It dawned on me that while I was putting the dirty dishes left on the table by the previous occupants, I noticed a cart with 2 pre-made lunched that were exactly like ours. Seeing this was my first time to Tea Light Cafe, I thought maybe our meals were supposed to be cold. I asked the guy that dropped them off if that was the case. He said no and that he'd be right over to fix it.   He scooped up our meals and came back a few moments later. Our meat was warm but it was as tough as shoe leather. My wife stated the obvious, they reheated our meals and presented it to us. Too bad, as that is the worst thing a restaurant can do.   I think we caught them on a bad day, as the foot traffic was nonstop."}
{"text":"I am definitely not an expert in Vietnamese food, just to put that out there.  That said, I really enjoy Tea Lite Cafe.  My co-workers and I go here regularly, and it is a staple in the portfolio.    I get the #1 and honestly don't remember its name, only the deliciousness of the rice noodles and beef.  The beef has amazing flavor and I wish there was about twice as much included in the dish (not just because it tastes good, but also because I could use a little bit more protein to get me through the afternoon).  We often get an order of the shrimp spring rolls to help supplement the lunches here.  The service is very fast.  Important tip for weekday lunches:  get there early!  This place fills up quickly and does not have many tables."}
{"text":"We love this little restaurant. Amazing and fresh salads, delicious chicken&  rice vermicelli noodles pho. 5 stars when it comes to excellent customer service also"}
{"text":"I am a long time Vietnamese food fan... this place is right across the street from my office, so I hit it up for lunch pretty regularly.   I've had the beef and chicken pho, and the bun (noodle bowl thingy), not tried the sandwich yet, but I will.  The soup broth is great. The noodles are tasty.   The beef soup is my favorite - it contains the yummy viet style meatballs, rare beef, and brisket. Only complaint is that it should come with more herbs, but this is Scottsdale... not Da Vang or Maxim on the Wessyde.   The spring rolls are pretty good. I've had better, but I order them sometimes, anyway. A Viet spring roll is wrapped in rice paper, with noodles, pork, shrimp, and herbs inside. Not deep fried. Yum. Eat with peanut sauce, and some chile sauce or sriracha.  The bun (noodle bowl) is really good, too!  It's clean, the service is fast, and the food is tasty and healthy, unlike most everything else in that shopping center.   To the person who said they never saw a Vietnamese sandwich before... fail. :( It's a wonderful result of the sad history of French colonialism in Vietnam, and these days, typical Viet fare. I love them at Da Vang, and will have to try one at Tea Light some time soon. Expect an update when I do! But... the pho is so good, I don't usually stray from it.   Down side: With a belly full of noodles, I want to take a nap."}
{"text":"The Pho is to die for! My favorite is the Tea Light Special because it's a taste of a couple different appetizers and a soup. Be sure to try the boba drinks, they're delicious and they offer a good selection of flavors. I love how small it is and how it has a family run business feel to it."}
{"text":"Best soup if your sick! Always consistent, and flavorful! And the spring rolls are always fresh!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love pho and Vietnamese food in general. My experience at Tea Lite Cafe was awful. The pho was super salty, and one of my spring rolls had a green beetle inside, which I noticed was crawling around after I had bitten into the roll.  I will say the service was very quick and efficient though."}
{"text":"Very bland spring rolls (would benefit from some fresh herbs rolled in) and extremely salty pho broth. 3 stars because of the quick service (but it was early afternoon and not especially busy). If you want good Vietnamese and don't mind an extra 20 min drive go to Noodles Ranch on Thomas & Scottsdale Rd - far better pho & fresh spring rolls!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner tonight.  While it was decent, I didn't love it.  We got 2 entrees and 1 appetizer for the family.  I ordered the chicken bun which came with 2 spring rolls.  The kids split an order of pork spring rolls and the hubby got the BBQ beef and rice dish.  The beef BBQ was excellent as well as the noodles in the bun dish and the veggies.  The veggies were very fresh.  The egg rolls were a bit disappointing - sort of mushy on the inside and while the chicken was tender, it had a very generic soy sauce flavoring and not the usual vietnamese lemon grass type of flavoring that I am used to.  Will try this place again, mostly due to the proximity to our home and also to try the pho."}
{"text":"delicious food everytime! this place gets pretty busy during lunch time so make sure you come early. its a bit small but we usually get take out anyways. the hubby has pretty much tried everything on their menu but he says the pork chop is the best."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with several girl friends.  Greeted and seated ourselves after ordering.  Minutes later, a rolling tray came out with our very hot food.   We ordered the #1 with pork, #1 with beef, #3 with veggie egg rolls and chicken and a Tea Light Special (Pho, egg roll and spring roll).  All were good.  The egg rolls were fresh, hot and crunchy.  While the chicken was plentiful, it had a different type of texture hard to describe.  I kept thinking it was a pork.  Not sure how it is prepared, it is just different from what I am use to.  Prices are reasonable and parking plentiful in this large mall.  Many other diners filtering in and out."}
{"text":"Where to begin.  The beef sandwhich is just awesome and tasty.  The beef is juicy and the sauce is good.  The bread is crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside, combined with the fresh greens on the sandwhich, it's my favorite thing on the menu.  The chicken pho is right up there with the sandwhich.  The broth is just delicious as is the noodles and chicken.  You also have the choice to spice it up with a side plate of other ingredients that accompanys the dish.  The staff are very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"The best pho in the valley hands down! I come here all the time and am greeted with a smile and they treat me like I am one of the family. The food is fabulous and I've never had a bad bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie pho and it was delicious! The veggie broth was amazing, not sweet or cinnamon flavored like some. I loved that they had all of the cilantro already picked off the stems too, a nice touch I haven't seen with pho before. Overall the pho was delicious and everything seemed fresh. Will be a repeat customer here for sure."}
{"text":"I live and work nearby and while I use to go 2-3 times a week, it has dropped off to maybe once a month.  I've seen the restaurant go through 3 different ownership and the current guy (English/German maybe?) brought in new staff.  The whole place has loss it's appeal of the Vietnamese Pho restaurant as it seems too Americanized now - less savory broth and overcompensating the decor (think buddha and chinese signs).  I'm going to rate this based on being Vietnamese and having my share of this type of food growing up but it is a decent place to have lunch and dinner.  Not the best you can find in Scottsdale and there are better mom/pop restaurants in Phx. With the new ownership, the prices have gone up a bit. One thing that isn't so great is the Boba -- it's more icy than flavorful and probably won't get it again. However, it's a quick stop for lunch or to go for dinner."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  This place was far from any Vietnamese place I have ever tried.  It is unfortunate that most people who gave this a glowing review have either never had authentic Vietnamese food, or have no taste buds.  There was no flavor!  I had to put hot sauce on my food to give it some flavor!  And the kicker is that this place is owned by a white guy.  LOL...you have been warned!"}
{"text":"great food, great service, spring rolls are great and the PHO is awesome as well! i have started to go here on a weekly basis"}
{"text":"Found this little gem with an entertainment book coupon...it was great! I had the tea light special with beef pho noodles and the flavor was awesome! The egg rolls were excellent too. Crunchy, fresh, and hot just like they should be The pho broth was flavorful and tasted very rich and smooth. My mom had the number 1 with grilled beef and it was amazing too. Tender beef, crunchy cool veggies, and a nice sauce that complimented the dish well. Great location right next to the movie theater so it's convenient for dinner and a movie. We will definitely be back, thank you for a great meal!!"}
{"text":"In town for a conference and was looking for some good Vietnamese food. I was quite skeptical, since I am from Orange County (the home of some of the best Vietnamese food). With high yelp ratings I decided to give Tea Lite Cafe a chance.   Must admit when I walked in I hesitated a bit. Why?  A Caucasian gentleman was taking our orders. Not that there is anything wrong with this, but for a minute I questioned the authenticity of the food.  I'm used to a Mom & Pop shop where I have to use my broken Vietnamese to order.  But, they are SMART; communication is KEY.  They know their customers and cater to them. I was able to place my order w/ ease (no language barriers).    MSG rating: 0.5/5 KID FRIENDLY: yes AMBIANCE: casual  ORDERING PROCESS:  1) Just like Mickey Ds....you pick which # you want.   Easy! 2) Pay at the register 3) Pick your table and food will be brought to you.   *****THE FOOD GIST********* Rest assure - the cook is Asian.  Food was quite authentic and full of flavor.   BEEF PHO (beef noodle soup):  Broth was clear and well seasoned.  Lots of meats.  Not bad...legit!  COM SUONG NUONG (grilled porkchop & rice):  kids LOVED it.  Porkchop was marinated very well and grilled just right. 2 pieces of porkchop, SCORE!  GOI CUON (spring rolls w/ shrimp/pork):  fresh ingredients and a rather decent peanut sauce.    BUN THIT NUONG CHA GIO (vermicelli noodles w/ grilled pork & egg rolls): This truly HIT the SPOT.  Happy with marinate & grill marks on the pork and a nice crunch w/ the egg rolls.  A rather light dish w/ noodles, meats and lot of veggies.    THAI TEA: consistent w/ Thai restaurants.    In the 2.5 days we stayed in AZ.  We went here 2x.  That says a LOT.  Will definitely return if we are ever in town again.  pssssss.....check out the bathroom. Pretty neat-O!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I can remember, my brother brought me here for the first time and the food is really good, but last time me my sister and her boyfriend came had a weird experience, we got there at 8:25 and it was not very busy, we ordered for 3 and to eat in(they close at 9) they brought our food in not a very friendly manner and we started eating. A group of people came in at 8:45 ish and we saw the faces of the staff being mad at them for coming, like they really didn't want any of us business. The manager I guess turned off some lights and put the closing sign(it was 8:45 and they close at 9 so I guess he didn't wanted anyone else to come in) and did it in a really obvious way in our face( we were eating on the patio). I get it, I've worked at food places and it's really hard but we as costumers got there at 8:25 still on time and the food is great and everything but it was very uncomfortable for us to rush to eat our food. The 2 stars are definitely for the food only because they get 5 on food but only 2 on service!"}
{"text":"AMAZING pho. We usually split (extra charge) the chicken pho and thats more than enough food for 2 people. One of the best pho's in the valley, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I had shrimp pho for lunch and it was ok. The broth was blend and the waiter didn't even bother to ask how my meal was."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious and a great go-to nearby. My favorite Vietnamese spot is located in Glendale, and we moved into Cave Creek, so it's often hard to make the drive. We found this place while going to grab Greek food just next to it and decided to give it a shot. We've eaten there 4-6 times and it's always a delight. The Bun (or Vietnamese Vermicelli Bowl) is my favorite and always a go-to. We get it with the egg rolls for added crunch! We love chili paste too, so we always load that into our bowl and our Pho since we usually split the two meals when we go. Great flavors, fresh, not overly oily and quick too! I recommend this place to family when they come into town and what something somewhat healthy and close by. I also get the Pho whenever I'm feeling under the weather, with some added chili to help kick the bug and cure me up!"}
{"text":"What happened to your sandwhiches?   Why did you remove them from the menu?  Miss your banh mi's.  It was great to get a bowl of pho and split a sandwhich, best of both worlds.  Now will settle for just pho."}
{"text":"The pho here is very authentic and a great find for Scottsdale! The actual restaurant is quite small but there is outdoor seating available. It is closed on Sunday though so be warned! - Tea Light Special: a great deal considering ordering the egg rolls by themselves would already make up half of the cost of the special. The egg rolls are very delicious by the way. Fun fact: they tend to \"hide\" some beef underneath the noodles so just keep looking for it, I promise you will find some at the end when you least expect it.  - Marinated Grilled Beef Bun: a favorite - Marinated and Grilled Pork Chops: very flavorful and tasty"}
{"text":"Well, it is complicated once you live so close to Mekong plaza...but this place has a good variety of food and the thing that I most liked was actually the tea and the way it was served!! I realized too late they did have boba tea!!  Food was ok, and the service really friendly. Make sure not to confuse it with the nail shop!!"}
{"text":"Close to the movie theater. Great little noodle shop. and that's all it is what makes it great is that they focus on serving great noodles nothing else.   I eat here a lot before and after the movie. If it's Sunday or Monday and there's a football game going on then I eat at Blue 32.  Great food. Great price. Authentic taste"}
{"text":"This is a great Vietnamese find!  I have been a loyal customer over the years and even though owners have changed the great quality of food has stayed the same. Everything is so fresh and service is exceptional. It's a nice casual feel and a perfect place to go before catching a movie next door. Prices are reasonable as well!  The pho is in a good size bowl, enough for someone who is very hungry.  My personal favorite is #14, grilled beef and rice. The spring rolls are delicious as well.  This is an all around great restaurant!"}
{"text":"One word sums this place up - overrated! It was a Sunday and I tried locating a Thai or Pho establishment and everything nearby was closed except for Tea Lite Cafe.  Located in a large big box shopping center Tea Lite Cafe is small and was fulled to capacity. When I inquired to the Asian if they had a sign in waiting list he replied no so we had to wait and then place our order and then waited to be seated.   When I received my plate of bean spouts, mints, lime and slice jalapenos the portion was the smallest ever for a Pho restaurant. The bowl of pho I received was small with a small amount of meats and was over priced in my opinion. In addition the broth tasted sweet and tasted like sugar was added to the broth!  I don't add any sauces when I eat Pho so this just didn't taste natural at all.  I would not return here again."}
{"text":"Yep, I sure am a fan of this tucked away Vietnamese jewel. Tea Lite is located by a nail place and the Cine Capri in N. Scottsdale area. Has a small patio area to dine al fresco also, if you please.  I order the Beef Pho and it is pretty good! Spring rolls and egg rolls never disappoint me either! They turn out a very nice Vietnamese (iced) coffee too - especially when the warmer weather hits. ;)  This is also the first place that I've seen TV monitor advertising in the bathroom (on the sink hardware). Interesting place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Best people/owners! Can't go wrong with anything there! The pho is amazing!!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in Scottsdale.  Great Spring Rolls, Bun Ga and Pho Ga."}
{"text":"Healthy food is served here. From the pho soups to all entres, your gut will thank you. I'm so happy to have found this place. We do come here often. Only one dish I do not care for, chicken salad, you get a bowl of lettuce and the chicken not fresh enough for me."}
{"text":"Skimpy on the noodles in the pho bowls. Spring rolls are pretty bad. Ok in a pinch but not a specific lunch destination.  Probably won't come here again."}
{"text":"I love pho and I am def happy that Tea light cafe is super close to my home and work making it super accessible either for lunch or a quick dinner after a long workout.   The pho is pretty good - not the best I have ever had but they do have a solid broth and the up charge for extra meatballs is only $1.00... Which keeps my bowl of delish pho under $10.00, so how can you beat that!   They also offer non pho items like rice and noodle dishes. I have seen a few people enjoying the rice bowls and they don't look bad! I also love that you can order online for pickup.   Quick, friendly, and prices are on point! A def low key pre movie, post movie, or lunch time spot!"}
{"text":"Meh. Tea Lights almost hit the spot when we craved Vietnamese and didn't feel like driving across town, but with only 4 items on the menu (no, I'm not joking), I would expect them to at least nail the few offerings they've got. Not so much. The pho is weak, at best. The bun is okay, though I would definitely recommend the grilled beef bun over the somewhat lame chicken version.   No table service, but I'm totally fine with counter service for the right food. The pre-made items I could see in the kitchen were a little off-putting, but we hoped it would come out at least tasting freshly made.  We are leaving with the feeling of a solid \"meh\". Not horrible. Not fantastic. Maybe somewhere in between. But probably not worth the return trip."}
{"text":"It was a cute place, service decent.  It IS nice that they even have a Vietnamese restaurant in this area.  All this being said, I ordered their pho which was recommended by the cashier.  She says they are known for their pho.  I'm sad to say that I was disappointed.  Their broth wasn't that flavorful.  And the protein portion was very skimpy!  I did like the fact that they had the summer roll and pho combo.  I could live without their summer rolls.  This is Scottsdale, so I am sure they are catering to their taste.  I prefer more authentic tasting."}
{"text":"I definitely love coming here with my family and friends. Quick service and the food is always very good. Love their Thai tea boba too!"}
{"text":"I'm probably more a 2.5 star rating here, but it was definitely not a 3 star A-OK visit. First and probably the most frustrating part about our visit was the white guy at the register, he had a serious attitude problem, which I see some other people also experienced. He was short and snippy and gave me one word answers, like help a sister out, I've not been here before. I ordered the #3 beef with no rice noodles just salad. It was supposed to be served with egg rolls, but instead came with spring rolls (which I do not like). We got take out so I didn't realize this until we got home. The salad that came with it was basically all lettuce and a small amount of carrots and 4 tiny cucumber 1/4 slices. The peanut dressing was extremely runny. My husband got beef pho and enjoyed it, wasn't the best he's had but was acceptable. The food came out lightening fast, like less than 5 min which semi scares me. My husband said he would go back and I guess I would if he forced me."}
{"text":"Tea Lite Cafe offers a massive amount of food quick and cheap.   While the food is plentiful, it's still pretty light.  You'll be quite full after eating at Tea Lite, but you won't have that slickly heavy feeling that comes with over indulging in most fast food.  It's a great place to stop in before or after hitting up a movie right next door.  My problem with Tea Lite is the lack of variety in its flavor.  The cilantro in each dish sticks out (not a problem for me but I do know plenty of people that dislike cilantro), but every dish pretty much tastes the same.  The small menu basically offers chicken, beef, or pork as a Pho, Bun or sandwich.  The Pho tasted like the Bun only with brought and a touch of spice from jalapeño.  With the acceptation of the dipping sauce, the Vegetarian Spring Rolls tasted like Bun and Pho, only with the added rubbery texture of the clear rice paper (the tofu tastes just like the chicken).  The hot sauce that's served on the side of the entrees is very good and hot."}
{"text":"Usually love ordering the Tea Light Special for years now but tonight 3/26/16 the broth was no where near the quality. The broth tasted like dirty water and the meat was a little like leather. We did go near closing time so maybe that was the reason. Normally would give 4-5 stars but tonight was a three stars because of average of all the times I have eaten here.  Will try again and update review."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this place.  It small, cheap, fast and the food is delicious.  I mainly get the chicken soup, the best noodle soup ever.  The service is always good and friendly.  A good place for lunch or to catch a quick and tasty bite before a movie at the Harkins close by.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego so maybe I'm just spoiled with the  best food from around the world located in one city but... Seriously? So my friend and I both order the beef bowl. The food comes out fairly quick so that's one good thing. The rest just downhill from there. The taste of the broth was mediocre, pretty bland. The top was cover entirely with onions and green onions. And the green onions weren't  even chopped well. I had huge pieces of the root in my broth. Now to the soup as a whole. It had maybe 6 pieces of beef, meatballs, and a pinch of noodles. It was the most basic bowl of pho I have ever seen. I am not exaggerating when i say i ate the entire thing with  3 scoops of my chopsticks. For $10 this was the most expensive pho i have ever had and it was also the smallest in portions.   As far as the service, the restaurant is set up where you order in the front and pick a seat. The man in front seemed very bored of his job. For the most part he answered my questions. That is where they recieve their 1 star.  Never will i ever recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great recondition by a local friend. Quick inexpensive for N Scottsdale area and was super tasty."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! My 5 year old loves the beef pho, everything is always fresh and delicious! Great prices and nice and quite. If you are in the area I would more than recommend this restaurant. The staff are also very helpful and always willing to explain the different dishes. Huge portions as well!"}
{"text":"My husband and I both loved this place! The Pho was wonderful and they have some of the best eggrolls I have ever had! The service was friendly and quick.  We will definitely be making Tea Lite a regular."}
{"text":"Many Gluten free options. Food is fresh and healthy  Love the chicken pho and beef or pork bun.  Spring tools are delicious too!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the service and the bubble tea only. I got lost trying to find this place and circled around a few times before deciding to just call the restaurant and get directions. I told the person on the phone where I was and if they could tell me where the restaurant was. After a short pause I heard a characteristic phone click as I just got hung up on. Seriously, who hangs up on a lost potential customer that only wants to get to your restaurant to give you business??   Luckily my bubble tea partner in crime Kemlyn B. called to give me directions to Tealight since she had the same problem trying to find the restaurant and had just parked. For your reference it is a few doors down from the movie theater and is neighboring a nail salon.   The bubble tea menu is pretty limited and includes smoothies in honeydew, coconut, strawberry, and taro, as well as various teas and coffees. After hearing a less than enthusiastic response from Kemlyn about the smoothie she had I chose a Thai iced tea with boba. The total ended up being a little over $4.  The Thai iced tea was decent with a light sweetness. The boba was pretty disgusting though. It was very mushy tasting and disintegrated in my mouth as I tried to chew it.  I wouldn't go here again just for bubble tea, and based on the rude service I probably would skip trying it out again for food."}
{"text":"I'm from Washington D.C. where Pho is a way of life.  I started working in Phoenix/Scottsdale about 15 months ago and was always craving a bowl of pho when I started to miss D.C.  Given my love of Yelp! you'd think I'd have just got on here but it just never occurred to me.  I found this place purely by happenstance when  going to lunch with co-workers at Buffalo Wild Wings.  I now go to Tea Light Cafe sometimes twice a week.  I've only been indulging in pho for about five to six years but in that time span I've enjoyed pho in over 50 pho specific or vietnamese restaurants.  Tea Light definitely scores in my top 10.   So specific to the pho.  Tea Light is more of a vietnamese cafe/restaurant that has pho than a \"pho spot\" where the menu might be 20 variations of pho.  So here go the important parts:  The broth - spiced to perfection. I will admit my palate prefers a saltier pho.   That being said I could show up daily and have them put some broth in a thermos and I could drink it all day.    The noodles - the rice noodles have just the right texture and the right quantity.  Meat - Compared to more pho specific spots Tea Light only offers beef or chicken compared to flank steak and round eye or tripe and brisket.  Though it's limited to beef or chicken I feel the meat is consistently of good quality and portion.  The meat appears butchered properly and I never find myself trying to resolve some giant chunk of fat.  Very lean and very yummy.  Veggies - A little lacking.  Typically you get twice as many bean sprouts, jalapeno peppers and cilantro.  I'm willing to assume though that if I actually asked for more they would give it to me.  I'm sorry to say that given the quality of their pho I never tried anything else on their menu.  I plan on coming back whenever my need for pho becomes unbearable or if I'm just driving by.  This place is great."}
{"text":"I have to say that this was a great restaurant. My partner and I went there for dinner today, and we both enjoyed it immensely. I chose the beef pho, which I had never tried before, and was very impressed. The flavor was very good, and it was filled with lots of great ingredients. My partner ordered the beef and rice bowl, also very delicious. The beef had great flavor combinations, sweet and salty, with a nice kick to it. It came with two egg rolls on top, which were some of the best that I've ever had. For these two entrees and two small drinks, it was just about $19.00, which I think is quite a considerable bargain because of the huge portions that you receive. We will definitely plan on returning to the wonderful establishment, and recommend it to anyone who is willing to try something different!"}
{"text":"Finally veered away from my usual sandwich or cold rice noodles and ordered the beef pho....darn it was good!"}
{"text":"My favorite here is the chicken pho - the flavors are so clean and vibrant, I find myself just craving it some days.  Friendly atmosphere, quick service, and just near enough to my work to make it a reasonable stop for my lunch break.  :0)  Perfect!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Relatively inexpensive for always fresh and delicious food! Have to come!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people have been digging this place and that's awesome! I love Vietnamese food but... I can't warrant this as true Vietnamese food. As far as the pho, the choices are limited and the meat and broth doesn't have the traditional flavor. On the other hand, there are not many Viet places around n. Scottsdale so if you are looking for a quick fix and your in the neighborhood check tea lite out. Vietnamese food is getting a bit trendy as a healthy meal but don't let this place be the only one you visit. It's a drive but Chandler and Mesa have some real great places for traditional Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Great little place. Food was delicious and fresh. The service was prompt and attentive. I would come back regularly here if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Pho! This place is locally owned and has amazing food. I get Pho to go or eat here at least once a week. Service is friendly and food is amazing. It's a must if you love Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Looove their pho. It's a pretty tiny place, but really clean and everyone is really friendly that works there. It's in a great location too. It's the closest Vietnamese restaurant to me so I go there the most often, in fact I'm going there for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Thai tea and Matcha tea are delicious. I also love that I can the eat rice noodles as they are gluten free."}
{"text":"This is a nice, clean, friendly restaurant to get an introduction into Vietnamese food.  Nothing too risky but good flavors.  Might just scratch your itch."}
{"text":"Best pho in North Scottsdale! Highly recommend this hidden gem--they have great flavor, great service and plenty of indoor & outdoor seating.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best pho I've had. A lot of solid flavors. It is also always busy when I visit, but the service is really quick."}
{"text":"Seems like Yelpers are either hot or cold about this place, and I can understand why.  I ordered the chicken salad and shrimp spring rolls. I couldn't eat the chicken and picked it out of my salad. My first impression of the chicken was, \"over cooked\". Then came the taste test. Second impression, \"tastes like poo\". I tried another piece and changed my mind to \"tastes like dog food\", which is how dog poo starts out. Now, I have never eaten either one, but taste and smell go hand and hand.  After picking out the non-edible chicken, the salad was pretty blah.  The spring rolls tasted like the salad with added mint and shrimps. They were so so.  Don't think I will go back to try anything else."}
{"text":"Scant meat for the price.  I only come here because it's the only choice near my house.  The soup is not bad tasting and hits the spot but could I get a little more protein with those noodles, please?"}
{"text":"Good but not great. I got the beef pho and the pork egg rolls. The pho wasn't spectacular. Not bad by any means, but I have had much more flavorful pho in the past. The egg rolls I got because of all the positive chatter about them but even they were only so so. Ill have to give them another try."}
{"text":"Great place to have a bowl of pho for lunch at first glance you might think the pho will be very Americanized but when the first sip of the broth hits your toung you know it was made correct service is very fast so a 30-45 min lunch if you work close by is plenty of time if your ordering a bowl of pho you won't need a apatizer it is a big bowl but if you want to try one the spring rolls are awsome too"}
{"text":"Decent Vietnamese food in the middle of north Scottsdale... that's pleasantly surprising! Almost everything is under $10 and portions are pretty generous. I always get their bun varieties and Vietnamese coffee and it's always good."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for dinner after reading numourous good reviews.  I was disappointed.. though the pho broth was very clear, the noodles and meat were not so good.  The noodles were more like rice noodles and the meat was as rough as sandpaper.  The eggrolls were decent, very fresh.  I'm still debating to go back and try the porkchop.   All in all I would rather drive down to Chandler for a good bowl of Pho"}
{"text":"This is my everyday go-to lunch spot! I always get the #11 - beef pho. It's a very large bowl and everything is prepared so quickly. The staff is very pleasant and remembers me order, even if I haven't been in for a while. Free wifi too, and some TVs and music. Both indoor and outdoor seating are comfortable and pricing is in line with other places at about $8."}
{"text":"I've been driving by Tea Lite for awhile but never had a desire to try this place but for some reason we decided to try it today.   This is a small little place with a few tables outside with umbrellas and with about 8-9 tables inside. So for a big group is can be a little difficult.   So you order at the counter and then you find your own table. They bring your food to the table. No number given, no name given. They somehow figure out what you ordered. Interesting.   I ordered the Spring rolls to start it off. They looked really good. The rolls were pretty good. There was a lot of vegetables and shrimp. When you put the roll in that peanut dipping sauce, oh my goodness. Really enjoyed it soaking it in that dipping sauce.   I ordered the Beef and Egg Roll. What a meal. Grilled beef, noodles, salad, and egg roll. Loved it all. They give you this sauce to dump all over it and it really brought out the taste. Nice tender beef. Nice salad. Really enjoyed the egg roll. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the egg roll more than the spring rolls. This was a really filling lunch and really good.   My wife ordered the Chicken Pho. She really liked it. Got to try the chicken. Thinly cut chicken and it was pretty good. My wife was able to finish up her Pho. Only issue was it had a little to much MSG. Little thirsty afterwards.   So the service was amazingly pretty fast. Our spring rolls came out really fast. This older Asian man rolled out the rolls on a carts and knew which tables ordered spring rolls. Impressive. All the food came out fast on this cart and the tables were cleaned up pretty fast. Tables were turning over pretty fast.   So I couldn't ask for anything more. Good food, fast service, and big portions. We really enjoyed it and will be coming back again. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Tea Lite Cafe several times for lunch during the week.  When I am in the area I usually stop and order the Chicken Salad which has romaine lettuce, carrots, cilantro, cucumbers, and bean sprouts and a lite vinegar dressing served on the side. It is a gluten free salad that I have had many times. It looks good and is served promptly with slices of warm hot off the grill marinated chicken pieces.  My favorite drink is the iced Matcha Green Tea which is so refreshing with orange and pineapple juice blended into the drink. The service is prompt and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Lackluster food and over priced. They didn't deliver on the flavorful food expected at those types of restaurants. Feels Americanized. There are many better options in the area.   Only plus, the restaurant itself is clean."}
{"text":"I go to Tea Lite Cafe for lunch and I have always enjoyed it. It is priced right and they get you your food quickly. If you are looking for some Pho I would recommend this place to anyone. The flavor is good. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it did not blow me away."}
{"text":"We love this place! Never been to Vietnam, but this seems to be the real deal! Try the chicken soup! I always get extra basil and cilantro! Hubby likes the spring rolls. We really enjoy this place in the winter months."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in the north valley for Vietnamese food! Great pho and bun and good service. The owner is friendly and the food is always fresh full of flavor. If you have not been here, you must go!!! The only thing missing is a beer or wine option....the it would be worth 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It is my go to place whenever I'm craving pho. Prices are good and the service is great. The owner is super sweet and helpful. The pho tastes great along with their egg rolls."}
{"text":"If the star rating was just for the Beef Pho recenlty, it would be 5 stars!  If it was for their Boba, it would be a 1 - thus the compromise of a 3 star rating. The Boba I had was, well, disgusting.  Admittedly, I make my own at home so have high expectations.  Theirs was so overcooked that it was completely mushy and had a very odd aftertaste.  NOT something I would ever order from them again.  Hopefully they've improved it since I tried it almost 9 months ago...I've refused to try it since."}
{"text":"Very bland. The peanut sauce and the nuac mam that was served with my spring and egg rolls were watery and not flavorful as it should be. They skimp on the the greens that typically goes into a bowl of pho. To top it off, the prices are ridiculous for the quantity and quality you get. If you're looking for an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, this is NOT it."}
{"text":"I've only been to Tea Light Cafe once, and I probably won't go back. I just didn't think it was very good. I had some kind of bland noodle-y soup that just didn't do it for me and a strawberry tea.  The tea itself was good, but the gummy-like balls that I sucked up in my straw kind of gave me the heebie jeebies.  BUT, if you really like Vietnamese food, I bet you'd love this place. Maybe I just don't like it because I'm not too familiar with the food.  My friend loves this place and swears by it, but I just didn't see it when I was there and found it a little too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch for around 10 bucks.  Their #3 with cooked noodles, vegetables, pork and egg roll is very tasty with the additions of some chili and hoisin sauce.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really great pho.  Delicious broth.  It comes with citrus, jalapenos, sprouts, & basil.  A couple yummy sauces.  Great spring rolls too!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight to try this place out. The egg rolls were pretty good, just a traditional egg roll with a crispy thin wrapping and a meaty filling. But the pho....so disappointing. Just bland....none of the complex flavors in a good pho broth were there. Yuck. Never going here for a pho fix again that's for sure."}
{"text":"Maybe we came in on an off day, but I was extremely disappointed. Right when we walked in the cashier didn't look up at us for a good minute. When she finally noticed our existence, she was less than delightful and off-putting.   My friend ordered a Vietnamese Iced Coffee. If I had a time machine, I would use it to go back to this moment in time to stop my friend from such a horrible mistake. Don't order the \"Vietnamese iced coffee\". It's laughable to even call it that.   After tasting the Vietnamese Iced Coffee, I was expecting nothing from the Pho. I would say it was mildly average.   For the love of god, if this is the only VIETNAMESE restaurant you have ever gone to, do yourself a favor and go to one of the ones in Tempe or Chandler (miss Saigon)."}
{"text":"Great place, cheap, clean, healthy food served fast and with a smile. Nice place to have in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I visited Tea Light Cafe for the first time with a friend - we were both craving Vietnamese. This little restaurant did not disappoint. I ordered the pho - it was ready in a flash!  I had to add a lot of hot sauce and lemon to make the flavors pop, but in the end it was delicious .  If you're in the mood for a quick lunch, this is a great little spot. small but cozy interior, friendly staff and inexpensive FAST food."}
{"text":"Great place to get some fast Vietnamese food. The semi-sit down environment is good for eating out on your lunch break. Tables are clean and have a cool zen-like touch with pebbles and stones embedded inside the glass.  But lets talk food folks. The portions are pretty light, but it sure is tasty. BBQ beef is delicious, and they also have a small boba tea and iced coffee offering. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Food was really good and service was friendly and super fast. Mm mm mm. .................................................................mm"}
{"text":"I am huge fan of this place!  I have been going there for about 3 years now as they are very close to my office.  I can call in an order, drive over there in 5 minutes and it is ready for me.  It is always the same gentleman helping me as the cashier.  The quality of the food is AWESOME!!  I am pretty snobby about my Asian food :-).  The only thing that I get confused on is do I tip?"}
{"text":"This is our weekly destination for Vietnamese. North Scottsdale is limited on the Vietnamese options, but I believe this is the best in terms of good food, atmosphere, and service. Nice to sit on the patio when it's not boiling outside. The Spring Rolls are always fresh, the ice coffee is delicious, and the pho is great as well. The only con in my book is that the menu is small and missing the more adventurous parts of pho."}
{"text":"although i gave 3 stars i would go back.  tea lite is close to me so an easy choice to start my pho adventure.  liked the combo that included pho, egg rolls and a spring roll.  nice variety and just the right portion.  i always get pho with seafood but they don't offer it so i was bummed about that.  ordered the beef and liked the taste plus it wasn't salty like some places i've tried.  the combo was about $7 so very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I'll start off by letting you know I wouldn't know good Vietnamese food from bad so mine is not the best opinion.  Since they are, as one other reviewer described, an independent establishment in a sea of corporate chains I have to give them four stars.  That said, I've never seen sandwiches at a Vietnamese restaurant. It's like they are trying to accomodate some of the local crowd that most likely wouldn't eat typical Vietnamese fare.  Ultimately I had a good tasting reasonably priced lunch in a flash. Since they're close to my office it's another plus with all the Scottsdale Road construction."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place at least twice a month. My husband loves the pork chops and I love the pho Tea Lite Special. The food is prepared fresh and you never have to wait. Their salads are excellent and their fresh brewed authentic green tea is a welcome change. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"oh boy, I guess if you haven't had much exposure to Vietnamese food then it would be decent.  I'm from San Francisco and this place would go out of business in a heart beat up there."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to have received a bowl of pho in Scottsdale that wasn't horribly Americanized. Was it as great at Pho 43 in Phx? No, but, the best in Scottsdale so far!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and it never disappoints! Great food, good prices and excellent service!"}
{"text":"This is Vietnamese food for North Scottsdale white folks who have never had Vietnamese food before.  It's a fast food style place that gives you food with very little flavor and tells you to start adding sriracha and oyster sauce util it starts to taste good.  Really really bad."}
{"text":"Probably thr best Vietnamese food in all of Scottsdale!!:)) amazing pho/ fresh and fragrant:)) the place is always clean and the employees super polite and friendly. I love coming here and getting spring rolls/ veggie egg rolls and salads/ pork chop is great too. Give it a try!!:))"}
{"text":"Love this place! I love it so much that I'm very surprised at the tepid reviews. A cozy Vietnamese deli with warm, fast and efficient counter service, this is exactly the kind of eatery I regularly seek out.   I tried the vegetable sandwich and the Vietnamese coffee. The sandwich, served on French bread, was topped with fresh veggies, including shredded carrots, cilantro and mint, and a sweet aioli spread. It was flavorful, fresh and filling. The coffee, mixed with condensed milk, was sweet, but not too sweet -- just the way I like it.  My only complaint: it's a bit on the high side for this type of fare. My meal came to $10; at Lee's, the tab would have been $7 tops. But this a nicer place than Lee's, where the service and atmosphere leave something to be desired.  I will be back. This place is a new favorite."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has such high ratings!!! You people need to try real Pho. I just left out of there disappointed! It was sooo Americanized, as I expected but hoped I was wrong. The beef in the pho was tough. The boba pearl was under cooked and hard."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. The pho is awesome comfort food. It just feels right in the fall. Be sure to use the sauces on the table to heat things up!"}
{"text":"Quite good, large selection, fast service. MUST try thier coffee and iced matcha. Why arent you open on sunday!"}
{"text":"On a hot day, on a cold day.  Pho is the Vietnamese version of Chicken Soup for the Soul. YES, we live in a climate where 75% of the year is over 90 degrees. But really there are few things as great as the healing properties of a good bowl of Pho.  My fiance and I have been coming here for years - and within the past year - they have really made some improvements.  They've redecorated, and improved their patio furniture (yes, we've actually eaten Pho outside in the middle of summer!)  They've even gotten new plates/bowls.  Just when we thought they couldn't improve they did!  Tea Light Cafe is an amazing little Vietnamese restaurant located on the cusp of North Scottsdale and Phoenix.  Location Location Location:  Conveniently situated next to the Harkins Cine Capri and Buffalo Wild Wings at the Scottsdale 101 plaza - it is a high traffic area.  Perfect to grab a bite before a movie - OR, if you are like my fiance and I, perfect to grab a few beers at BWW and then head to Tea Light Cafe for some REAL food.    For all the positives of the location comes anegative.  The menu is a bit toned down and you're not going to find the ultra authentic foods here (no tripe or tendon!).  North Scottsdale isn't quite ready for that.  What you will find is a small menu with all of the essentials you need.  A fantastic minimalist approach - offer a smaller menu but offer everything on the menu to the level of perfection.  Like clockwork the super friendly owners and employees know our order.  Beef and Beefball Pho Noodle Soup for me, Vietnamese Pork and Vermicelli Noodles for my fiance, and of course an order of super fresh, light, cool spring rolls to start.  Perfect to combat the heat.  Oh - and a cup for ice tea - because they have some of the most amazing ice tea brews.  Soo refreshing and flavorful you don't even need sugar!  if you decide to split the Pho I believe they charge you a split fee.  But because we always order two entrees - they bring out a small bowl so my fiance and I can share (the portions are huge and there's no way I could finish a whole bowl).  A wonderful, fresh, huge meal for about $20.00!  And let me tell you - nothing beats a hangover like a huge bowl of Pho Noodle Soup (doused in Chili Paste and the Rooster of course!).  Although I've never had the Banh I have friends who have ordered it and loved it!  The one other thing I suggest is to eat at the restaurant.  The food needs to be fresh and hot to really enjoy it.  Hot or cold temps - nothing's gonna come between me and my Pho!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! Excellent Pho & egg rolls. The employees are fantastic as well. I am always recommending this place."}
{"text":"The chicken pho is my go-to when even the possibility of sniffles is on the horizon and I can't pass up their crunchy and savory egg rolls even when I should be on a broth based diet.   Portion size is beyond generous -- typically at least two meals. I primarily order for pick-up and the wait time is always under 15 minutes. Don't judge the restaurant by it's strip mall appearance. Cozy dining in options including outside patio seating."}
{"text":"Excellent, really great place. Really awesome vermicelli bowls. Ignore any reviews that are under five stars."}
{"text":"I always have the chicken pho bowl and add some chili sauce and hoisen to it...I love this place! The soup just hits the spot! Be sure to add in all the extras they give you, lemon, lime, basil, jalapeño, and sprouts, they make it delicious!"}
{"text":"SO Yummy! I was craving Pho and this restaurant was close so I decided to try it! Definetly going back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Pho is not good here.  Broth tasted like dirty towels.  Sandwiches are decent though."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, great prices. Tea Light Cafe is a good place if you're looking for a quick Vietnamese meal. You order at the counter from a small menu (pho, noodle bowls, and rice plates). Prices were all under $10 for substantial portions. I had a combo noodle bowl (#3) with chicken and spring roll. Food was fresh and flavorful. The staff were also very nice and helped us move around tables and chairs to fit our group. The only thing that wasn't great was the boba, which was a little too soft. Vietnamese iced coffee was great otherwise. We will be back!"}
{"text":"A visit to this place is how I treat myself!  I love, love, love the pho, sandwiches, bun, and spring rolls.  If you are undecided on what to order, go with the special-- it's a little sampling of everything.    I know this place \"Americanized\", I've had more authentic Vietnamese before, but it's still quite tasty ;) It's also very consistent-- something I value in my lunch take-out places. Service is quick and very friendly.  I'm very appreciative of the speed-- when dining in the restaurant, we are able to get in and out during lunch in less than an hour."}
{"text":"This place has had consistently good food. Every time I go there I get my food quickly and it's always tasty. This place is also in a great location; its right by the movie theatre."}
{"text":"Went to Tea Light Cafe with my wife today.  Split a bowl of beef pho (pho bo) with her (Vietnamese Beef Noodle Soup).  Also had an order of goi cuon (Vietnamese salad rolls).  The pho was very good.  The goi cuon was perhaps a little chewy.  Otherwise, it is good."}
{"text":"The Nuoc Mam here is horrible. It is missing so many components that make this dressing crucial to most Vietnamese dishes.  It's too bad because the food is decent. But then you're stuck with bad sauce..and it's not just the Nuoc Mam...the peanut sauce is more like peanut water.  Good: Egg rolls #3 Bowl  Bad: Chicken pho (ok tasting but there is some ingredient in it that doesn't taste quite right....can't quite put my finger on) Spring rolls (mostly noodle filler)  Really Bad: The Sauces (as mentioned above) Pickled carrots mostly taste of salt with no sweetness  So if you are not picky about your sauces, I'd say give it a try. Or if you are a complete newbie. Just know there is something better out there.   I dream of San Diego chicken pho and will continue to pursue it here in Phoenix.  P.S. This place is better than Saigon Nites though!"}
{"text":"Tea Lite Cafe was great!  I was very excited to learn there was a Vietnamese shop nearby because I missed getting beef pho.   This place definitely delivered on my hopes and desires. The food was delicious and well priced. My friend ordered a meat and rice dish that I can't remember the name of but he devoured it in seconds.  I will definitely be going back there soon."}
{"text":"I like how clean this restaurant is. It's very casual as you place your order at the counter and sit. The food is good but the portion size can be small if you're used to the huge sizes other Vietnamese restaurants offer. Minus one star due to small portions and lack of variety. They don't offer really authentic Vietnamese choices like tripes, tendons, etc. I wish they offer Vietnamese crepes also. However, what they do have, it's really good."}
{"text":"Great little Vietnamese spot has excellent pho as well as the vermicelli noodles, great egg rolls and spring rolls everything is fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"My go to place when I want something delicious and quick. I always get the pho which is just so damn good! Noodles are soft and the broth is da bomb. Perfect remedy for a cold, sore throat, or an empty stomach. The other reason why I love this soup is that it has no stinky pho smell that most pho soups have. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?! Comes in a big bowl that can be shared or have it all to yourself! A little pricey but nothing to cry about. Mmmm...craving one now...I should go before they close in 30 minutes..."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with pho! It is absolutely amazing!!!! I would go here at least once a week. It's a great place to go on a nice day and sit outside. The portions are huge for a great price! I highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Love the beef bun, chicken pho and the egg rolls. Really, you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Very good. Heard bout this place for yrs & finally went after a movie; simple, lite & healthy. Great spring rolls & reasonable. Joins other great choices such as blue 32, Carlos o'brien's, bourbon jacks & even Denny's!"}
{"text":"This is the best noodle soup bowl place I can find in the area.  I drive 30+ minutes just to go eat here. They are super fast serving up the noodle soup bowls.  Today I got one to go and it was ready before I paid for it!  The people are very friendly.  I've also had the spring roll and it was really good too.  Recommend this for a fast, delicious meal.  It always seems to have people eating there. At lunch today it was packed inside and out."}
{"text":"First and foremost, this fast food Vietnam restaurant is way over priced for a bowl of soup. I had Chicken Pho which was pretty good, nothing memorable, but $9 for a bowl of broth with a few pieces of chicken is just too pricey. My companion had #1 Pork Bun which he said was dry and not much flavor. It was also $9. We also had the Spring rolls which were rubbery and we had no idea they were shrimp rolls until the last bite. They were tasteless and filled with lettuce. They were $7. We were hoping for some good food but we were disappointed. After blowing $30 on lunch for two, we won't be back. Sad because we were very hopeful."}
{"text":"Lived in Seattle for 5 years and when I moved back here I was worried about finding good pho. Tea Light Cafe is incredible! I swear they must use organic chicken and you can taste the difference. Get the #12!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here about 2 times a week and it is one of my favorite restaurants! Best Vietnamese food around here. Flavor is fantastic!!!! I usually get one of 3 things; chicken pho soup, spring roll appetizer, bun #3. I can't tell you how much I love this restaurant because it's so tasty and you have to try it yourself. The food is fresh and flavor is on point. Service is great and meats are high quality."}
