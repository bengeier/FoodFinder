{"text":"Me and my family have been coming here for some time now. And each time is never  dissapointing. Our favorites are the ceviche tostadas, pepino relleno, cruda loca, la coqueta and from time to time the fruit tray! Well worth the price and drive! Marco and his team always make us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"I have been to Clamatos La Cruda twice in one week. Need I say more?  I dream about these Clamatos, and their Instagram feed makes only serves to strengthen my obsession!  The staff is super friendly too!  I've had their Clamato that is loaded with fresh shrimp, cucumber, beef jerky and topped with chamoy and tajin. Their shrimp tacos were delicious as well. Can't wait to try their other menu items as it all looks amazing!"}
{"text":"EXPENSIVE!!! I ordered two large \"mamadelacruda\" Clamato drinks. On top of its pricey cost you don't get a complete concoction of the drink, you only get the Clamato (base of the drink) and sauces like soy sauce and chamoy, etc., leaving the second most important part out... BEER Plus, if You want to add peanuts and shrimp, or a tamarind stick it's an additional Fee per item, I paid around $35 for two drinks and I still Had to provide my own beer I think the prices with out the beer are a little much, if the beer had been included I'd feel a lot differently. They're drinks definitely remind me of the times I go to TJ and order a \"Clamato preparado\"..... Next time I'll either make them at home or stick to drinking micheladas at restaurants where it's less than $7 beer included."}
{"text":"I live in Prescott and while I was in the valley  I drove across town just to come to this place, I follow them on Instagram and the pictures look amazing but in person its a whole different story .  First of all the prizes are ridiculous. I paid 12 dollars for a cup full of ice more than anything,  clamato, and 4 pieces of shrimp.  For that price I could've gone to a real mariscos restaurant and gotten a good mariscos cocktail not 4 pieces! Seriously extremely disappointed. Never coming back and I'll make sure to spread the word.  This place is a joke"}
{"text":"I really enjoy drinking a prepared clamato but the prices at this place are outrageous. They are super expensive and not worth it in my opinion. They add 3/4 ice and 1/4 clamato so you mainly pay for excess ice. Additionally if you want to add anything extra like, tamarind, shrimp, meat, cucumber, etc,. you have to pay extra so at the end of the night you could be paying $15 dollars for a drink that is composed mainly of ice and a few extras (small quantaties). I rather buy the stuff and make at home since I would probably get more for my money. I also paid with my debit card and they charged me an extra $2.50 for my card transaction, which is a super high charge. Wont be going back after this experience."}
{"text":"Clamatos La Cruda are the bomb. They remind me of my college days at Rocky Point and not to mention the the cut fruit with Chamoy, lemon and Tajin!!! Yummy!!. Great food and service. Thanks Marco."}
{"text":"I felt the place was clean and predictable for a simple spot and that's ok. The young lady working behind the counter was nice but could have smiled a little more. The ingredients are fresh and the shrimp tasted correct. Tips on how to order a better drink: order very little ice if any, ask for only a half cup full of Clamato unless you love it and last but not least don't order the dried shrimp it can be overwhelming salty. Take cash because you'll get charged extra for debit/credit. Overall the flavor of the drinks are good just add an avocado and it's a winner. You can bring your own beer, kind of nice. Price is moderate if you order a simple one.  Don't steer away from this place because it has potential."}
{"text":"I really like the way they took on the shrimp cocktail. The idea of adding beef jerky is awesome. At first we were skeptical, but after eating it with the rest of the food, it just makes sense. Although the originality and the flavors were great, everything tasted the same. We ordered four different items which all seemed to blend together. The price point was also too high. The main cook wasn't using gloves while handling ready to eat food, which made me uncomfortable. I hope my family and I don't get sick."}
{"text":"The Clamatos here weren't all that great, mine looked great but tasted off. Maybe the salsas that they added? Their presentation itself is nice, the beer jerked they use is good, and offer a pretty good variety of prepared Clamato. Now when I ordered the shrimp taco, I didn't expect much as I saw this place as only Clamatos, but I was pretty surprised that it tasted pretty good! The chipotle sauce is just what it needed to give it that extra kick! I probably won't be on here for a big Clamato often but I'll probably visit back for their shrimp tacos and try their other food and snacks"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Drove all the way from the west side TWICE an hour before the closing time listed online only for them to be closed early. And the phone number listed online doesn't accept incoming calls so you can't even call to make sure they're open before making the drive. Don't trust the hours of operation listed online."}
{"text":"If it's not the best place for Clamatos yet. Sure it's getting close to... Great Customer service and delicious food. I love it!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for their seafood. Couldn't decide on something specific So went with two shrimp tacos, a ceviche tostada, and an agua de pina (pineapple water). Food was ok. There was something in the shrimps tacos that made the tortillas soggy before being able to eat. The ceviche was awesome, fresh and exact to its flavor. Going to give this place another try as they have tons more food: shrimp cocktail, fish tacos, ceviche on pepino."}
{"text":"This Place was AMAZING!! Authentic and Original Flavors and they use very fresh Ingredients! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Very refreshing and tasty as well...if you're price conscious then the flavors will satisfy any palet...."}
{"text":"The prices are ridiculously high for poor tasting food and drinks. Not worth it. I feel bad saying that since the owners seemed nice but I wouldn't waste my money again there. The drinks just look nice but they are super expensive and don't taste very good."}
{"text":"One of my friends has been dying to go here for a LONG time, so we weren't too far and decided to go on a random Saturday on a whim. It's not a big place by any means, but it serves the type of restaurant it is.    --First things first -- GET A TACO...just one even if you don't want one. Do it.   Moving on....as I don't speak Spanish (very very little) having the pictures and menu really helped me with my selection...It was the one with jerky and shrimp...I also added avocado which I highly recommend.  Also I'm gonna be honest, going here, I was skeptical if I would even like it since I'm not a huge fan of Clamato....BUT worriers beware! I LOVED it...whatever salsa, seasonings, to add the extra spice/zipp/heat transforms the base beyond recognition...((((How are you not also making bloody mary's?!?!?!?!?!?!?.....I'd come just for THAT))))...Ok but anyway back to what IS on the menu...  So yes, I got a big delicious thing..however if you're HUNGRY I'd double the shrimp if possible...and here's a   -TIP 1- if you get the jerky...let it soak in the magic clamato concoction, it takes it to anther level. -Tip 2- Bring your own beer!   Great quality ingredients, beautiful presentation.  Cheers...I'll see ya again...  ----why 4 stars instead of 5?...the dining area could have been slightly cleaner..."}
{"text":"Prices are quite high. I paid nearly $25 for a large cup of ice, clamato, and 3 pieces of shrimp and a fruit drink. It was decent but not  $25 worth. I don't think I'd want to spend that much if I can just make it cheaper at home."}
{"text":"If you want to pay with debit or credit be aware would be an extra 2.50 cents extra for service fee. If you own a business nowadays you have to be able to take debit credit since thats part of everyday payment methods. 2.50 for just swiping my card not worth it."}
{"text":"Great customer service, very tasty Clamatos and other goodies. Highly recommend this place! You have to try #mamadelacruda"}
{"text":"This was our first time going to la Cruda we heard about it from friends. I got the shrimp cucumber and beef jerky pretty good. A lot of ice 5 pieces of shrimp mostly ice cost about 15 dollars. My girlfriend got the shrimp nachos she loved them but in all honesty in the world we live in today 41 dollars for that was definitely not worth it. I personally will not be going back 25 dollar nachos and a cup of ice is just to expensive in the world we live in today. The guy who helped us was very very nice and helpful the lady working with him had a attitude."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and it was brought out very quickly! However that was not the type of sit in restaurant I imagined. For the prices they have for their food and beer mixes they need to upgrade their look. It was very outdated and the place itself had a smell not a horrible smell just a smell that was not seafood. We still wanted to give them a shot because of all hype we have seen from them on social media. To order your food you do need to go up to them and then find a seat which were all mismatched and not very welcoming. If we do go back it will for sure be a to go order because like i mentioned it was delicious and the mixes for our beers (which is BYOB) were absolutely delicious! It was by far the best michelada i have had in a long time.  If they update their restaurant to match their pricing the star would for sure go up to 5"}
{"text":"Where to begin? First of all, this amazing local business offers the most original loaded Clamato drinks I have ever seen. Huge fresh shrimp, cucumber, chamoy, and carne seca???!! This is the flavor explosion that reminded me of the build-your-own Bloody Mary bar trend, only way better con mucho sabor.   I think the best part of this business (beyond their affordability, delivery option and central location), is their social media savvy. Their pictures on Instagram and Facebook make me want to jump through my phone with every one of their crazy concoctions.   This absolutely is the snack shop the community was missing. Well done!"}
{"text":"Crappiest customer service ever! I had a groupon for $20 and bought $20 worth and the total ended up being $21.62. When I proceeded to pay, the rude women at the cashier said, what are you paying with and I said, I had a groupon. She then said it's $4 more for the \"big\" cup. I said, you're charging me $4 because I'm using a groupon and there's nothing saying that on the groupon? Rude women stated, \"I'm the one making the rules.\" I didn't want to waste my time arguing and paid an additional $5 plus more. She still had the audacity to say if I got their promotional card. I'm like no thank you, I won't be coming back and walked out.. Beware, they are expensive and fraudulent.."}
{"text":"Just what I needed for my hangover! Staff very friendly and make you feel welcome. I got a \"La cruda te entra\" and had lots of shrimp and beef jerky omg mouth watering. I definitely recomend, next time I will bring my beer."}
{"text":"27.00 dollars for one cocktail with only 5 pieces of shrimp and a giant cup filled with ice and a fruit drink with some grapefruit orange slices and squirt. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"If you are okay with paying $35 for two drinks then this is the place to go. The drink consisted mostly of clamato and ice. It only had 4 shrimps and the cucumber and avocado were an extra charge. It's way overpriced when you can get a similar drink for half the price."}
{"text":"La Cruda is located just south of Thomas and 32nd street, in a small strip mall.  The restaurant is small clean, with a trendy old diner feel.  Great customer service, very patient with me for my first visit.  Restaurant has Michelada drinks plus food menu.  The fresh shrimp with Clamato was so good - reminder bring your own beer. Also order the plate with Fresh Shrimp, Oysters, Dried Shrimp, Beef Jerky, cucumber with all the spices - Delicious. Very Fresh produce."}
{"text":"came here with my mom to try it out as ive herd of it from the radio. came to this hidden gem and was taken by surprise. we got 2 large joey boy specials shrimp clamatos 2 shrimp tacos and the fruit platter. the cocktail was so good and loaded with shrimp and avocado and everything in between. we didnt even finish them. the tacos were good too. it was pricey tho. we paid like $70 for just those items. overall it was a good food experience and we will be back to try other items"}
{"text":"i loved my shrimp cocktail  , verry very good , great flavor, friendly , i will be back"}
