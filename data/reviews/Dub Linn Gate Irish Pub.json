{"text":"It was my first time here .I really liked the place the food was good and the server was nice and polite. The only thing that spoiled the lovely experience was the check where the price of my drink wasn't the same as on the menu. The server fixed it right away , and it was only a dollar difference bus still wasn't very pleasant  So check you bill. Other than that I liked everything."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer but the food tastes like frozen food. It feels like this place is one of those franchise Irish pubs in Toronto. The menus were familiar to me."}
{"text":"Great place for a family get together.  The clan took over the backroom for a birthday party.  Exceptionally great time.   The atmosphere was warm and friendly.  The food was great, as pub food goes.  Kari was a helpful coordinator and her staff was attentive to our needs.  If you have a group of 30+, set it up for around 7pm, so the older folks are there before the crowds, and the youngins can stay late and enjoy the band."}
{"text":"Menu was average. Had the burger. Very plain and uninspired. Fries were good, service was great. Good selection of draught beer. Surprisingly wasn't busy for lunchtime on a Thursday, which was a plus for me."}
{"text":"Good:  atmosphere, scotch selection, service.  Especially Kaitlyn. Bad:  I had the Cajun chicken wrap, which would've been tons better if one half of the wrap wasn't cold, the other hot.  (I was just that hungry so my own personal rule is if I eat it, I buy it, otherwise I could see them having to buy a lot of dinners if it all comes out that way.) Ugly:  there was a literal armada of fruit flies.  I mean like, ar-freakin-mada.  I'm a man, I can handle a lot.  THAT disgusted ME.  I actually covered my scotch with a coaster...they were stalking me I swear!)  The place smells like the floor mats & the draft system needs to be seriously cleaned (like the smell of a frat house on Tuesday morning when the beer that caked itself on the floor is fermenting before your eyes.  Yeah, THAT smell.)"}
{"text":"Only had apps and drinks when I was there but the bar selection was great and food was delicious. Staff was friendly, would return."}
{"text":"Located in the interchange plaza @ Hwy 7 and Jane in Vaughan (AMC plaza) this hidden spot is the quintessential Irish pub. Say what you want there is nothing better in the GTA (perhaps even Toronto....Gasp I dropped the T-bomb). Ya I said it!  Think I'm blowing smoke out your corn cob pipe? No chance pal. step in for a pint with your lads or lasses one night and you'll see. The thought and detail that has gone into decorating this place has transformed a seemingly large 2 floors space into a warm ornate Irish pub is overwhelmingly Beautiful!  The food here is a thing of beauty as well and after reviewing the easy to read menu the Reuben came highly recommended and was totally BANG ON. Sauerkraut, a chipotle mayo, swiss cheese, pied high corned beef all on marble Rye. UH-Maze balls. Saints be praised  Instead of fries I opted for the spinach salad....WOW - best decision Ive made since deciding on boxers over briefs when I was 12. Spinach, a homemade sweet dressing, strawberries, mango slices, goat cheese and feta....Lord tunder and Jeezus WOW.  DLGIP has over 30 beers on tap and even more by the bottle and if you hurry you might even be able to join their Mug club, which I most certainly am joining. a $30 initiation fee gets you membership into this brew-club of beerly bretheren and a 25oz mug with your name or nickname inscribed on it. The mug sits behind the bar for all to see and any time you return you can ask for you mug by name (literally) and all your future beers are $5 for the fill. Gulp. Chug. POW  No Irish pub would be complete without live bands and music and DLG has that in abundance. By summer their patio has more rocking hits than the blarney stone and by winters cool breeze the stage inside makes you feel like you're living that scene form PS - I love you when Gerrard Butler sings to Hilary Swank (ya ya ya I watch chick flicks....ya wanna fight about it)  So gather your up your best mates and head over this way...Ill be the fella singing a happy song and dancing an Irish jig by the bar. Pint in hand and a shamrock in my heart."}
{"text":"I am a mixed blood, half Irish half Russian. I am not crazy about Russian or Irish cuisine, but I love Irish pubs. One of our favorite places is Dubb Linn Gate. My husband enjoys going there because of the beer selection. I enjoy it because the menu has a nice variety of food; the portions and prices are excellent. Walking into the restaurant, the d√©cor is dark and woody; it reminds of me the pubs in Cork that I used to go to when I visited my grandparents as a child.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable; I look forward to my next visit to Dubb Lin Gate."}
{"text":"Arrived for a quick dinner on a Wednesday night and it was pretty empty.  Good news was I was in time for $5 drafts and 1/2 price apps.  Glad they were half price; if I had to pay full price I would have overpaid.  Beer was cold and server was pleasant and efficient,  so no real complaints.  Just not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"This is a great pub!  When you first walk in you notice a huge patio and when you get inside you realize this cozy little pub is huge!  I went with a group of 25 people and they accommodated us perfectly.  The waitress let us sit and talk without disturbing us and trying to make us leave and or pay.  The one flaw is the service.  The waitress never came to the table to take my order (I arrived late).  It wasn't a big deal.  I just went to the bar and ordered my drinks.  The staff were very friendly and more than eager to help.  I also ordered sweet potato fries and they were really good.  For a nice cozy pub, this place is great!  I also highly recommend it for large groups.   I would have given this pub a 5 but I'm giving them a 4 because it would have been nice if the waitress came to the table to take my order.  They also have a pool table up stairs.  Definitely a great place to enjoy an evening!  :D"}
{"text":"This is a really neat spot for a drink. Super super high ceilings, dark wood, steampunkian architectural notes.  Service is friendly and wings are decent as well. The night I went, they had $3.50 beer bottles, which is great (except for the whole having to drive there business).  The only thing I didn't like about it was how difficult it was to find from the street. It's past this HUUUUGE parking lot, then in a little enclave, which is not something I'm used to as a Torontonian. GPS was no help.   Other then that, everything was good, I'd likely be back again if I were in the area. There was a pretty good cover band as well, if you like that sort of thing (I do.)"}
{"text":"Too many college age kids and it can get really loud and crowed. If you are into bumping into people all night you'll love it :) , good for a quick stop for a beer on your way to or from somewhere. Have on the odd chance gone during a 'down time' and it had live band and I got a table, it was rather nice. I don't like the whole line up thing/bouncer outside..it's not a night club."}
{"text":"My teenage daughter and I were here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch after a morning of browsing at Vaughan Mills.  I haven't been to the AMC Centrium since AMC folded their Canadian operations.  As such there were only us and three other groups in the restaurant for lunch on a Saturday.  This was common for all of the restaurants there.  The interior decor is great, with a lot of solid woodwork that makes you realize that a lot of work went into making this place.  We were seated promptly, and our waitress explained the daily specials to us.  I chose to have the guiness beef stew.  I almost always order beef stew at most Irish restaurants, but my Irish friends never serve beef stew at home.  I wonder why?  This stew actually had a little bit of a spicy pepper kick to it.  Nothing to set your taste buds on fire, but enough to make you take notice.  My vegetarian daughter managed to get one of the \"special\" pasta dishes without any of the meat as her meal, and the restaurant was kind enough to deduct a couple of dollars from the meal since they didn't have to give her meat."}
{"text":"I read a few of the positive reviews for this bar slash restaurant.  Either the reviewer has never been to a decent restaurant or was paid for the review.  Place is run down and has this dead feel when you walk in.  Most TVs don't work right.  The projector TV seems like it was bought 15 years ago.  Ordered onion soup.  Got powdered soup with onion flakes and saltines in the side.  The rest of my order doesn't deserve the respect of my review."}
{"text":"Aside from Fionn MacCools, Tilted Kilt, Sin and Redemption, and the like... I don't think I've ever been to a legit Irish restaurant before.  After being pooped from playing at D&B, we walked over to this little strip of restaurants and shops at lunch time (there was even a club if I recall) in Vaughan. Finding this little gem was pretty sweet. Very rustic wooden casual feel.  Service was top notch. Although it wasn't very packed for a Sunday late afternoon. They were very good at explaining what is in their food including some entrees infused with Irish beer!  We had the Guiness infused lamb potato stew with scones, a burger and fries, and selected one of the Irish beers. Everything was delicious. No complaints.  They even have live shows where local singers and guitarists come and set up. Very calming. Nothing alarming.  Would like to come back to try their pot pies..."}
{"text":"Bigger African American waitress got an order wrong, and proceeded to be very nasty and rude. When approached she acted like a child. When the manager was confronted she made many excuses and was very little help.. Luckily the bartender behind the counter was very nice and accommodating. But it's a lackluster Irish pub which employs a person who should not work around people whatsoever... Goodbye dub linn gate irish pub, you should treat your customers better as there was only about 5 people in there on a Saturday night...."}
{"text":"Very respectable Irish bar, especially given the alternatives in the area.  The decor is welcoming and cozy and the bar area is especially impressive.  The interior is expansive, and there are TVs, but not so many of them that it becomes obnoxious.  I didn't try the food, but the other patrons seemed to enjoy the hell out of theirs.  The selection of ales on tap is very good, and their bar boasts three shelves of single malts, and the usual selection of Irish Whiskeys, though unconscionably missing Redbreast during my last visit.  Service was exemplary at the bar, and this one particular very sweet raven-haired lady was especially accommodating.  I did notice some scrambling among the other staff from time to time responding to table requests.  My only complaints are the clientele can be irritating -- one night I was greeted by a gaggle of under-age kids drinking soda and taking up space at the bar with nothing remaining for devoted drinkers -- and they don't follow their posted hours very closely when it's cold and a bit dead -- I arrived one frigid Sunday when they were supposed to be open till 11:00 and they had already called last call before 10:00."}
{"text":"had the Cobb Salad, which was Ok. The onion rings are quite good though.  Disappointing beer selection, went with the old standby of Guiness, which is always good, but was hoping to try some other varieties.  the atmosphere and decor was great. we sat at a hightop table in the bar area, which I usually do not like, but it was very comfortable (maybe the Guiness helped)"}
{"text":"Really greasy and gross food. My boyfriend and I stumbled on this place on the way from Dave and Busters on our anniversary. We got home all bloated and with a heartburn after eating there. Yuck"}
{"text":"The decor was pretty cool but nothing to exceptional. The staff was helpful but seems pretty rushed. The whole table was served except for my sister and brother-in-law, whose food showed up a good 15min later.  The beer was fresh.  The chicken samosas had no trace of chicken in them.  I ordered the Steak and Stilton pot pie. It was not good at all. The top was burned and the bottom was soggy. The steak inside was dry and tough. There was no trace of stilton. The gravy was severely lacking and the mash was stiff and tasteless.  My girlfriend's description of the soup of the day (beef and veg) was \"salty and lacking in beef.\" I tasted the side salad that came with a friend's burger and was surprised how bland the dressing was.  I ordered a ginger ale and got a glass that was barely over half full.  The band was pretty horrid as well, screwing up lyrics, but that's not entirely the venue's fault.  All in all I don't think I'll be coming back. Drop half the menu, up the quality and hire enough staff to actually care for the customers."}
{"text":"This place is way bigger than I thought it would be, with different rooms, a big bar upstairs, and lots of seating. I liked how you could overlook the main floor from the second floor. Three of the bathrooms were out of order when I was here, which was a real drag. They also weren't the cleanest and this was around 5 pm, before the hordes of people started coming in. The bar staff and the bouncers were all very friendly. Our waitress seemed to be ignoring us for the first half hour we were there but she warmed up a bit later on. I had the nachos which I wouldn't order again and I had the sweet potato fries which were REALLY good. They had a lot of beers on tap from what I remember. They have a space for a live band and what I assume would've been a dance floor, but there were a tonne of tables and chairs in the way (it was St Patty's). I'd definitely go back to this bar. It had a vibe I was into and I'd like to check it out on a night that wasn't such a big event."}
{"text":"Service 5/5 Food 5/5 Price 5/5  Came in here with my girlfriend around 3pm-4pm. The service was great, the food portions are huge. They have great daily deals, and 1L steamwhistle for 17$ and you keep the boat glass if you buy it.   We came in had to 2 irish pints for 11$. For food with had the calamari which was great, I had a sheppards pie 5/5 and my girlfrend had the steak pie which I tried and was amazing 5/5.  Overall great place to come to and have a drink and some food. I will be back here anytime I am in the Vaughan area and need a drink."}
{"text":"Nice place in a great area. My first time here for a get together with friends from work. The menu was a little limited I thought but after all it's a pub so I am grateful for finding a non-deep fried item. I found my wrap and salad on the last page of the menu under \"Healthy Choices\" complete with calorie counts. There was also chicken \"without antibiotics\". Unfortunately it was breaded and fried with a side of fries."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I stopped by here on a Saturday night, before we went to the mini golf close by.  I had the spinach and artichoke dip, and definitely was good. It comes with pretzel bread which is warm and even more delicious on it's own.  Their service was ok, they seemed pretty busy even though the place wasn't that packed.  Other than that, it's a decent place."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon around 4:00pm for dinner, hungry because we'd skipped lunch. Walked in not sure if they were even open, because it looked empty and there was no host, but a bartender then addressed us. A wedding party was taking photos in the main pub/dining area, so we were seated in the side room, which was fine. Just one other table occupied.   I ordered the Irish stew (because the steak pie could not be made without Stilton since it was pre-made, and I dislike Stilton). It arrived and looked like a bowl of watered-down gravy. I could not see any chunks of meat or vegetables at all, just a smooth liquid surface in the bowl. Dipping my spoon in, I did find 3, 1-inch chunks of meat, a few potato chunks, and carrots cut so large I needed to use my knife to eat them. Flavour was fine, but this was a scant soup, not a rich and hearty Irish stew! It was nothing like the stew photo I see posted by yelper Teresa Y!  My date ordered the fish and chips. The fries were cold, and the two pieces of fish were the exact same size and shape - definitely not battered in-house - and they were wrapped in a green paper wrap with a glossy newspaper insert rather than a piece of newspaper. They were going for authenticity, but really failed. No tartar sauce was provided, either.  Needless to say, a very disappointing meal. We went over to IKEA and had a couple of 75 cent hot dogs because we were still hungry.   2 stars because it tasted alright and the server was friendly."}
{"text":"someone please show the girls how to pour a proper Black and Tan. I didn't order a \"beige\"."}
{"text":"Fantastic pub!  Typically, pubs in North America that advertise themselves as offering an \"authentic\" Irish or English pub experience fall far short. This is one pub that delivers.  Five solid Irish beers on tap, and even the non-Irish selection is good (Erdinger, etc.). Best of all, they actually pour it right, and it comes in the correct glass.  The food menu reads like most other pubs, but when I see a pot pie on the menu I try it. So I did here, and it was great. Actual pieces of steak, which is more than one can say about most restaurant pot pies (especially chicken pot pies!).  Most pubs I've been to in the UK feel like someone's living room. This place was too big to be a living room, but almost had that same feeling.  Was there for lunch on a Saturday, and it was empty. Perhaps things liven up in the evening, but I can't speak to that.  Biggest drawback is probably that it's located essentially in the middle of a parking lot in Vaughan, next to a movie theatre and an Ikea. But beggars can't be choosers, I guess.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I came one friday evening for a pitcher and poutine. It was fairly decent. There was a band playing but they weren't that great. Not the restaurants fault though. The poutine was just alright. I enjoyed the gravy but I could hardly taste the bacon bits until the last few bites. I guess they weren't scattered evenly and more so just in a lump on the side. However, the beer was good! Nice and refreshing.  I'm going to stick with my 3/5 stars for now and rate again when I visit next. I'll sample more and try to sit elsewhere. I also want one of those cool personal beer mugs Kris has been raving about."}
{"text":"4 stars for ambiance of an Irish pub for those missing it ; all their decor was transported here from Ireland  3.5 stars for the food as its reliable and good pub food  4 for the on tap"}
{"text":"I had to circle around the parking lot to find this place. When I got to it, the facade was pretty cool. Looks like a true Irish pub, but it's next to a large movie theater. As I entered, it was also designed as an Irish pub. Pretty neat. I was in the mood for fish and chips so that's what I ordered. Also got Rickard's red, my beer in Toronto. When I received the fish and chips it was huge and wrapped in paper. Just how I remembered in London when I got it off the street. I didn't think I was going to finish it, but I did! It was actually pretty good so were the chips! The server was nice too, didn't get her name or it's not on the receipt. I had a nice experience here, I will return for sure since it's by the hotel I stay at, so this place was BANGIN'!"}
{"text":"I just love places that offers daily specials! Dub Linn Gate does have so many different offerings for Happy Hour and Daily specials!  Steam Whistle and Wings Special ($10.99) on Wednesday is a Sweet Hot Deal! What's better than water down your Hot wings with a cold local beer at a good price! The wings is quite tasty and great as a late night snack!  Music definitely can be a little loud in the bar area even on a weeknight after 10 pm! Just ask the server to sit you at the back, far far away from the loud music, then everything is alright!  Service is efficient and friendly.   Drinks and Food Specials everyday?! Yes I will be back again!"}
{"text":"I mean, I'm not sure why I had such high expectations. Perhaps it's because I came in ravenous after being told here would be a two hour wait for a table at Dave and Busters. I figured how bad could pub food actually be?   Bad. Really, really bad. I ordered the butter chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Reuben sandwich. The butter chicken was 100% reheated and the rice was cooked at least a few days ago. My boyfriend said the Reuben was the worst one he'd ever had.   Friends of ours ordered perogies which were cold; so disappointing when you consider that this is \"normal\" Irish pub fare - how do you screw this up? In addition, they inquired with the waitress about an additional sauce they should have received and the waitress snarled back that they were incorrect when the menu stated otherwise.   Definitely will not be back here. This plaza is developing a reputation that precedes itself for really god awful food and service. The only reason this isn't a one star review is because there is an array of beers available.  I think the worst part is that I'm leaving hungry."}
{"text":"Quiet on a Wednesday night at 6pm... do people in and around Toronto eat later?  Not sure, since this location is in the middle of a courtyard by the AMC Theatre entrance.  It was -3 C when I went and it appears to have a nice outdoor area.  Anyway, the food was excellent.  The atmosphere is typical Irish pub... dark wood, gaelic-style lettering on everything, etc.  I debated between the Reuben and the Steak & Stilton Pot Pie. The waitress said they were very different, but the pot pie was a favorite so I went that direction.  Steak, stilton, and mushrooms made it earthy and delicious.  Loved it.  It came with mashed potatoes and peas.  I hate peas, so I didn't taste them.  The potatoes were nothing special--not bad, not good.  The gravy was tasty but I didn't feel there was enough of it on the plate.  Definitely going back tomorrow for the Rueben."}
