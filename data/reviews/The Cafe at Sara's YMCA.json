{"text":"I have tried several salads here and so far they are a-ok.  I have tried the PocoLoco, Strawberry Fields, Greek,  and the Ballantyne. The full size salads are huge but you can get a half if you aren't that hungry.   They have chicken, turkey, tuna, and vegetarian options. Also, with any of the salads you also have the choice of making it into a wrap or smashing it into a bread nowl. I have not tried either of those options as yet.   Other options if you are on the go: smoothies, protein bars, protein shakes, chips, popcorn, greek yogurt, or hummus w/pretzels (pre-packaged Boars Head).   The people working here are super friendly and I would say the service is 4-5 stars. But overall, I rate the food 3 stars - it is average but not outstanding.  Plus, I think is a little on the pricey side (with tax $10.01  for a full salad with chicken or turkey).    However, it is nice to have such a convenient option to grab a quick salad to take back to the office after a lunch - time workout."}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this place.  Got back to my office and had shriveled spinach with about 3 ounces of chicken.  This place wouldn't exist if it wasn't inside of a YMCA."}
{"text":"Good wraps and salads , today I have the Lean salad very good. Also the have teas too.  I like the option you can order half salad"}
