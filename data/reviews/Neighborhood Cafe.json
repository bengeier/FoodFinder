{"text":"I love the buffalo chicken wrap. Tried the wings the other week and the MAMBO sauce is the truth - the right balance of sweet heat. Service is great...great ambiance...great place in Historic West End!"}
{"text":"I began visiting this place weekly as soon as it opened. The food is good, but the staff is really great! Kim is amazing and brings me my \"regular\" drink anytime I come in. Just being a regular at a neighborhood spot feels so nice. The wings are my favorite thing on the menu--they have a specialty sauce called Mambo that up you should try (sweet and spicy). The garlic Parmesan wings are also good if you prefer a drier wing, with less sauce. And the neighborhood club is great for lunch! Overall, this is a wonderful place to sit on the patio and enjoy people watching."}
{"text":"Love the wings here!  This place is beside my son's barbershop and I never think about ordering food while waiting but my son kept saying how good the wings were so of course I had to try and all I can say is that the Mambo, Garlic Parm, Jerk, and chicken tacos were so good I had to go back the next day!  The chef makes all of his sauces in house and the wings are baked not fried......love this place!"}
{"text":"Finally a decent spot on the NW Corridor to sit down and have a drink or a bite to eat after work! Chef Eon puts a lot of thought into even the smallest menu items. For instance, he took off the Tuesday night wing special because he didn't have capacity to pump them out as fast as people were ordering, and replaced it with DOLLAR TACO TUESDAYS. Seriously great tacos. The fish (tilapia) is grilled or sauteed, well seasoned and just crispy, and they come with pineapple and a bit of fresh jalapeno. The chicken tacos are the same way, but they're topped with mango instead. The decor is 90s cool, with classic hip hop posters on one side and classic movie posters on the other. A full bar rounds out my requirements. I plan to be a regular; you should, too."}
{"text":"This is a cool spot. I am a vegetarian so honestly this is a tough place to go to for that but the staff was still great and made a grilled cheese sandwich for me and had potato chips on the side. It was nothing special because it's grilled cheese and potato chips but I enjoyed it and I really wished I still ate wings because I would have loved to try theirs.   The ambiance there is great. They may have the greatest wall ever of album covers. I was there for Wreck Da Mic Wednesdays. It was a real fun show and I encourage everyone interested in checking out Neighborhood Cafe to go out and support that show and those great comedians of Charlotte!"}
