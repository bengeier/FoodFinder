{"text":"Moving from back east I was hungry for bbq. This place is tucked back in the Esplanade and unless you know that it's there, you'll miss it. My husband had a pork shoulder.  The meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. If your tired of chain foods and want something fresh and different,  this is a 10 BUT make reservations because seating is limited."}
{"text":"We went to lunch with high hopes of some good southern BBQ. Our hopes were dashed. The food was barely warm and the sweet tea tasted like it was instant with lemon and the sugar was an afterthought. And the fried okra tasted like it had vinegar in it. We will not be returning. It's a shame though, I had heard that the previous owners made some fantastic BBQ."}
{"text":"Great barbacue and great service.  Under new ownership and everything is 100% Better. Love the lunch specials and great barbacue happening here."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork dinner with fries and fried okra today (my FIRST visit).  This place is amazing!  Ignore the negative reviews that have been posted on here.  Very clean, awesome service, great prices, and the food ROCKS!  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Meh..  very unorganized, food is mediocre worst of all they don't seem to care for the customer."}
{"text":"Researching in a new city for my rib fix I had a choice of five options along my route.  Smoke Dem Bones was the first.  Went in, smelled right, clean, people were friendly.  Ordered half rack of ribs, potato salad and peach cobbler.  Out of cobbler.  Ribs arrived promptly.  Sauce was already on them.  Arrived home and tasted one immediately before refrigerating them to reheat for dinner later.  Could not chew meat off the bones. Sauce was good.  Decided to wrap them in foil and slow bake for a couple of hours. That worked, they were good and no longer tough."}
{"text":"I might change my review IF I EVER GET TO EAT HERE!

I have tried 3 times this month to try and eat at this establishment. 
The first time I pulled in and found a note on the door stating they were closed do to a family emergency. 
Okay.. I understand that..

The second time they were open and had a pair of customers at a table inside. 
I approached the counter to order a couple of pounds of brisket. 
I was then informed that they were OUT OF BRISKET. Now this was lunch time. What restaurant runs out of brisket at lunch time with only a pair of customers? 
So I left, deciding I'd give this place one last try.

Today,  yes, New year's eve day, I tried again.  And once again,  there was a note on the door stating that the restaurant was closed until Jan. 2nd for vacation. 

Now I realize that everyone deserves a vacation. But it seems this place is either closed for some random reason or out of food..

I guess i'll stick with either Waldo's for ribs or Texas bbq house for brisket. 

I don't know if i'll even bother trying to try this place again. ."}
{"text":"I found this place through a friend and I have to say Thank you so much the ribs are fall of the bone delicious and the peach cobbler is like my grandmas so so good I tried the fried okra and it was fabulous So if you want great BBQ try Smoke Dem Bones cause it is so worth it friendly people and an awesome owner Made us feel so welcomed when we walked in I'll definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Went here last week with my ol lady we both loved it! Meat fell right off the bone! This is probably my favorite BBQ joint in the whole valley! Staff was very courteous and friendly. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I called to place an order for delivery and the guy simply stated \"we have a $30 minimum and you have to place the order through grub hub\" and then hung up. Congratulations on losing a customer before ever even earning one."}
{"text":"Coming from KC, I know good BBQ. This place is the best I've had in Phoenix, with excellent brisket and mac & cheese. The owner will take the time to sit and talk with you, and tell you about the food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I cant even comment on how the food was because I didnt even receive any.. Im not sure what sort of 'miscommunication' happened tonight but im extremely disappointed in the way I was treated tonight:   To tell a customer \"we wont help you, we dont have anything for you were sold out of everything\" .. thats just rude.. 

I had a full clear 6 min conversation taking my order and was reassured food would arrive about 20 mins.. 3 lbs of meat, fries and fried pickels..

Now you would think at SOME POINT if you didnt have ANY of these items why wasn't i given a call and informed?.. instead and hour and 15 mins go by and then im RUDELY told \"we wont help you\".... I was trying to feed an entire work crew of 13 people and you jackasses went as far as to putting me on hold for 15 mins - im sure to see how long i would stay on hold for- hang up the call for me to obviously call again, someone new to answer and give me some bullshit response of \"were sold out of everything, we dont have that, and We WONT help you\" -- wtf do you mean you WONT help me.
it took every bit of me not to take my ass down there after my shift to tell you exactly what you WONT say to me. 

your character is low."}
{"text":"A small building sits beside busy Indian School Rd. Seemingly not much bigger than a shoe box but inside is a very comfortable BBQ joint clean, well lit with a couple of flat screens.
Stopped in late saturday evening and were warmly greeted by the owner and his family,  nice people.
My girl and I both had a brisket sandwich. Tender juicy and flavorable and the sauce was perfect. All this and workingmans pricing. I highly recommend this humble eaterie."}
{"text":"No thanks. I ordered a brisket sandwich and I literally could not chew the \"meat\". I'm from the Midwest, Kansas to be specific and I've had some excellent BBQ. This wasn't even edible! Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"I ordered through eat24 which is run by yelp. I received my food order for delivery an hour and a half later. My food was cold and mushy and I was missing sides. I called the restaurant, the guy who answered argued with me about how he put the food I was missing in there and that he just made the food himself so it wasn't cold. One thing you should never do when it comes to dealing with an upset customer is argue with them. He put me on hold for 20 minutes while I sat on the other end of the phone listening to him chit chat and laugh. Very rude. The worst customer service I have ever received and the nasty mush I have ever eaten. My husband and I both work in the food industry and we will be telling EVERYONE WE KNOW to never eat here."}
{"text":"Don't order delivery here! Placed an order through Grubhub, and were told it was cancelled over an hour later because they were too busy to make the food. The restaurant did not call us, Grubhub had to let us know. Very unprofessional!"}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for 0 stars. 2 hours after placing an order for delivery on grubhub, I hadn't heard anything except the initial confirmation email. I called the restaurant to check the status and was fed a line about how traffic was crazy, their driver abandoned them, and they were the only one at the restaurant, so they weren't able to deliver. I asked about a refund and they just referred me to grubhub.

Thankfully grubhub issued a refund and gave me a $5 credit. I have never had any issues with grubhub, I use them all the time. If anything does come up, I usually get a call from the restaurant right away to let me know they're out of a type of food and that they'll credit the amount from my order.

It's incredibly unprofessional to wait 2 HOURS for your customer to call YOU; to not apologize for wasting someone's time, $, and killing their dinner plans; and to be completely unwilling to make things right. 

I will never eat here again, delivery or otherwise."}
{"text":"I visited this place for the first time today and I got a side of cabbage, mac and cheese and greens.  Due to the fact that I am a vegetarian i was informed that there were no meat in the cabbage or greens so I gave them a try.  The mac and cheese was tastey.  The greens were not my favorite but the cabbage....OMG the BEST Cabbage ever!!!!  The establishment was very clean and the cashier/cook was extremely nice and helpful.  I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Chicken Sandwich and coleslaw. Small family joint and the owner was great. It's a little small place on the corner with parking in the back so just have your eyes open for it."}
{"text":"First thing to say is DELICIOUS!!!!!! We found this place while at the hospice next store where my dad passed away the begining of April but let me tell you Im so glad we found it My family and I order everything from the pork sandwaiches to some fried catfish then for dessest peach cobbler Its goodness made from mamas kitchen The okra and fried pickles Ive never had so good before And then you have there bbq sauce Best Ive had in a long time I live in Goodyear and drove back there today just to get me a pork sandwich and some peach cobbler. Yes it was just as good as the first time I went. Paul Williams is the owner and he is such a kind hearted man When we were with my dad He was so kind to my family and even fed my grandparents a variety of items so they could try it all His restarant is the bomb So if your looking for a good BBQ place try \"Smoke Dem Bones BBQ\" You will not be disappointed! Remember I drove from Goodyear to Phoenix just for the pork sandwich a& peach cobbler Thats about 20miles one way And it was worth every bite!!!! If I could give 10 stars I would And remember He is. Phoenix Suns player back in the day so u can even meet a celebrity!  So what are you waiting for go get you some BBQ!!!****"}
{"text":"I love small town, friendly, good eateries like this! Smoke Dem Bones BBQ is near my fianc√©es office , so we popped in one day for an early dinner , late lunch kind of thing. You order from the counter in the small , casual establishment and the food is brought to you rather promptly after. I had the brisket and pulled pork with cole slaw. My fianc√©e had the brisket and hot ( sausage) links and macaroni and cheese. He is originally from North Carolina and knows his BBQ , and 'southern sides'. I just like good food! I was impressed with the briskets flavor and juiciness, because that's not always the case with a cut of meat, like brisket. The slaw is different with every barbeque place, it seems, but I really liked this one. The macaroni and cheese was homemade and creamy delicious. We liked the entire meal so much we got a three meat meal to go for dinner the next night! It's topped with the fact that it's super friendly and family run and they seem eager to please you with a great BBQ meal."}
{"text":"Well I don't know if this place even exists. I've tried to order on two separate occasions and they haven't answered any form of communication. For a $30 minimum plus $3 delivery fee you would expect them to be decent enough to answer. Oh well guess they'll never have my business."}
{"text":"I ordered through UberEats. The driver arrived at a good time, but my food arrived cold. It was dry. The portions were off by a lot and the taste was absolutely awful. The Mac n Cheese was cold and burnt and all portion sizes were fit for a toddler. The coleslaw wasn't coleslaw, it was dry shredded cabbage and the sweet potato fries were cold and soggy; just plain nasty...the meat was cold, dry and fatty. The beans and the collard greens smell gross. I would not give this food to a dog let alone eat it myself. After I put in the order I noticed there were no reviews within the UberEats app, at first I was concerned, but because I trust that UberEats only provide service from quality restaurants, my concerns faded. I use UberEats often and have always been satisfied, even if my order wasn't always right, at least the food was always tasty. This time after my order arrived, I came on yelp and noticed this place hasn't received above 1 Star in years. I suggest no one ever eat here and that UberEats remove this restaurant from their choices or they will get more complaints like mine. Thank God, they refunded all of my money as this entire order was just awful."}
{"text":"Hate to do it - I know how these reviews can hurt a small business - and i used to come here when it was \"Stacey's\" ... then it was Good!!! In fact i used to eat here often - it was that Good!!!

Came in the other day with a buddy who also used to eat here before and liked it.

BBQ was old and not even warm. Greens were seasoned horribly and even the mac n cheese was not fresh.

Iced tea tasted strange...

And to add injury to insult - prices were high.

I would have been ok with the price.. if the food was the same quality as it used to be.

But that was definitely not the case. I was close to asking for a refund until....

Oddly enough we watched the \"host\" and cook get into some type of verbal altercation.

I or my buddy won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've tried these guys a couple of times with the Brisket and Pulled Pork sandwiches. The  Brisket is good and the pulled pork was rather pedestrian and on the skinny side. I ordered the Large Pulled Pork sandwich versus the Regular Pulled Pork Sandwich on a take out order.

When I opened the bag up to eat the sandwich I was asking myself  \"Where's the Pork?\".  A small serving size doesn't cut it in my book when you order the large version.

But this place gave me the inspiration to make my own Pulled Pork. So this is a lemon to lemonade type of story. Thanks Smoke Dem Bones BBQ."}
{"text":"Just fyi, they don't do delivery and they don't have the courtesy to even inform you. They don't seem to know how to operate a phone. This has happened twice now, where they failed to make a delivery."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST BBQ and sides I've had in Phoenix since I've lived here (10 years)!!!  These guys have southern roots and know how to season the food to perfection!!!  Put on your bucket list!!!"}
{"text":"Worst delivery experience of my life tonight. Here's a copy of what I wrote to the customer service people. Zero stars are not an option but if they were - zero stars. 


I called to follow up on my missing delivery (almost 90 minutes after order) now and was told that the driver had a family emergency, and that my food was not coming. No I'm sorry, no I'll make it up to you -- Not even a \"I was going to call you and tell you\"!  And when I asked about the order refund, he said to call EAT 24. Literally the worst experience I've had in my life with a delivery. Please credit my card immediately and cease doing business with this joker who calls themselves a place of business."}
{"text":"I live on a much different part of town but I was in the area and thought I'd give it a chance.  I felt like I was sitting in someone's old dilapidated kitchen. I had the two meat combo with pulled chicken and pulled pork with fries and okra on the side. The chicken and pork was not pulled, it was chopped, which is drastically different. The meat seemed to be a lower quality and I have a feeling I'm going to get sick tonight. Also the meat should have been served with some kind of bread. The sides were once again nothing to write home about. I did like the sauce but no way I'd come back for just that. I can't imagine they'll be in business long, save your money and avoid this place, you'll thank me in the run."}
{"text":"So whoever is giving this place a low star rating, MUST have fell and bumped their head. The food was amazing! I had the rib dinner with Mac and cheese it blew my mind. The place is intimate but the food is explosive. Paul the owner was super friendly and made me feel like family. Thanks Paul I'll see you again real soon"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the door I got excited for \"Dem Bones\" and I ordered Brisket and the Pulled Pork Plate with Fried Okra and Green Beans. OMG!!  I cleaned my plate and I could not eat my desert since the helpings were so big. Everything was delicious. The owner is from the South but has lived in PHX for years. Older Suns fans might recognize him playing for the PHX Suns. Very tall with a Bass voice. Enjoyed his hospitality and Loved his food!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, however, for $16. You would expect more for a smoked chicken dinner more than one thigh, and one leg, on the small side, not enough food. Sides were also excellent. Could have eaten two dinners easy. For $32 though, not THAT good."}
{"text":"Just had the catfish today.  It was perfectly cooked, crispy and flaky!  Mac and cheese and greens were on point, too!"}
{"text":"I ordered the smoked chicken dinner with sides. I got the fries and macncheese. The side were good but the chicken was not smoked chicken. Was baked chicken smothered in bbq sauce. I really had my heart set on soft fall of the bone smoked taste chicken. Total cost for dinner meal with a small 12 Oz koolaid was $14.00."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon and then saw all the bad reviews so I was a bit worried.  No need to be!  It was very good.  We had pulled pork and beef brisket and the only problem is that $30 buys way too much for 2 people so we took home enough meat for a few more tasty meals.  For food quality, quantity, and price, I'd give it five stars, only the location and facilities bring it down to a 4."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a weekday. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and fried pickles. Took a long time for my food to come. Only one person was working behind the counter, and it did not seen like he knew 100%  what he was doing. Avec I finally got my good, the pork was luke-warm, not well seasoned or smoked, and the sauce tasted store bought. The fried pickles were sliced paper thin, writer bad breading that was separating. I have a feeling they were prepackaged frozen. I was very disappointed because the place smelled of delicious food, and I love good barbecue. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"WIsh there was an option for ZERO stars.

First time I ordered from this place the food never came. When I called and asked where my delivery food was, the employee said they couldn't find my location...I work at a large luxury retailer at the Phoenix Biltmore... I included all information in the delivery details as well..Guess the driver couldn't read the ENORMOUS sign on my building. Anyway, got a refund.

I made the mistake of ordering from this place again. Shame on me. I attempted to order the brisket, but their \"Staple\" meat was out of stock. Food took a century to arrive. Once it did, I was heartbroken.

Portion sizes wouldn't feed the appetite of a 2 year old toddler. The \"Smoked Sausage\" was basically a sliced hot dog with sweet baby rays BBQ sauce. The pulled chicken was..Definitely pulled...Pulled behind the delivery car and dragged through dirt. It was HORRIFICALLY DRY and flavor was non existent. 

Oh, and if I wanted cheap boxed mac'n'cheese I would have purchased it from Walmart. I expect more from a so called \"BBQ\" restaurant.

Save your time, money and appetite for a real meal somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cat fish and ribs are fabulous. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I love BBQ but I don't like a lot of smoke! That being said this place has the perfect balance of smoke! The owner Paul is a great guy! I would recommend this place for some down home cooking and great BBQ!"}
{"text":"yummy bbq - delivery a plus - delicious sides - the mac and cheese is amazing!!  coleslaw/potato salad/beans - all wonderrful..."}
{"text":"Horrible, tried to get a caters order, got hung up on, then they ran out of food!!!!!
WTF"}
{"text":"Staff and owner have no desire to give out good service. The food was undercooked and mediocre at best. They overcharged me for 2 sides I never received. I brought this to the attention of someone higher up and the owner responded saying  \"wow youre that broke\" simply because I asked for a refund for the sides I never received. I recommend that NO ONE waste their time and money here. You'll thank me later for the heads up."}
{"text":"WORST Hot Link Ever..... Not even spicy, more l8ke a hot dog and sliced up like you do hot dogs for kids, OMFG!!!"}
{"text":"Great ribs,  macaroni and cheese, fried pickles.   Friendly people and quick service. Good addition to the neighborhood..."}
{"text":"Okay, I heard this place was a good spot to get barbeque.   So, a few of my coworkers and I reviewed the menu online and decided to place our orders for lunch.  I called and ordered a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw, a pulled chicken sandwich with potato salad, two orders of ribs with the sides being fries, greens, potato salad and beans and a two meat combo with greens and potato salad.  I requested sides of barbecue sauce.  The man who took my orders was kind enough although he did express how overwhelmed he was feeling when I asked for a total.  The gentle stated he needed to call me back, I gave him my call back number however did not hear back after 15 minutes passed.  I called back and stated who I was and my reason for calling.  He apologized and stated he was feeling overwhelmed then gave me the total.   He then  stated that the food would be ready in the next 15 minutes for pick up.  My coworker who picked up the food had to wait an additional 30-45 minutes because the food was not ready.  My coworker arrived back to the office with the food  which was a major disappointment.  Both the pulled pork and pulled chicken lacked taste and flavor.  The pulled pork and chicken lacked the side of sauce.  The ribs where too tough and lacked favor.  The greens where a disappointment and the beans were tasteless.  The potato salad was okay however our entire experience was not a good one and we will definitely  spread the word about this food and it's sad to say that we have nothing good to say. It appears as if the owner does not check the reviews as I have not read a response to previously written reviews.  Lack of attention to what's really going on is bad for business."}
{"text":"Ummmmmm clearly says open and no one there?!?!? ?!!???!??????? So thank you for false advertising I went to Pork on a Fork on 19th st and camelback.... I would say they will have customers for a long time they had great food and guess what THEY WERE OPEN WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE OPEN!"}
{"text":"This review is for the BBQ only.  We came here for lunch and ordered pulled pork and brisket dinner and a rib dinner.  The meat was tender and delish and the sauce was amazing!  Absolutely loved the BBQ meat.

As for the sides, we tried the fried pickles and they were way too salty to eat.  The beans were out of a can and cold.  The French fries were comparable to McDonalds fries.  The coleslaw wasn't bad.  I did notice that the sides that did get good reviews, we didn't have so maybe the other options are better in all fairness.

I would come back and try a sandwich next time as the dinner doesn't come with any kind of bread and I need to have some bread with dinner.  A piece of Texas Toast or a bun for the pulled pork and brisket would have been nice.  If you do order the dinner and want bread you will need to request it.  We should have and didn't.  It is hard to find really good BBQ and they have it here.  
 
The service was great and friendly and we will come back and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"I attempted to eat here today after purchasing a groupon for $30 worth of BBQ. I had never been here before and I was excited to try it out. My boyfriend and I walked in and were greeted by a woman who yelled at us from across the restaurant  asking us if it was for \"here or to-go\". We said it was \"for here\" and we planned on using our groupon. She immediately stopped us and said the groupon was not valid until Monday (after the Super Bowl) despite there not being any clause in the groupon stating this. I was completely put off by the servers attitude so I decided to tell her we would come back when the groupon was valid. At that moment, the owner pops up and said to us as we were leaving that we better bring cash next time and that \"we don't do no damn groupons\". 
Needless to say, I asked groupon for a refund (and I was given one) and I will never return. We ended up going to wild game grill and spending $45 there. Rude employees and an owner who mouths off to potential customers is never a good way to stay in business, which has been a problem for the owner Stacy before."}
{"text":"1st tine here. When you walk in the door you know that they are smoking their BBQ the correct way . Very good BBQ joint. I had my favorite, the BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich and loved it. They smoke them the RIGHT WAY, and have the smoky flavor to prove it. Also have good shoestring french fries and standard coleslaw mix. The couple that owns it is very personable and friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and pleasant. I am recommending."}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ I've had in Phoenix.  Plus the owners were very personal with the great service they gave.  Can't wait to eat a full rack of ribs."}
{"text":"Placed my order through uber eats at 3:50 pm. Smoke dem Bones then started to change the delivery time.  Finally two hours later they told the driver that they ran out of all types of meat.  It took me forever to get my refund.  Right after this happened I placed an order at Dickey's  on Indian School Rd. through uber eats.  I got my stuff in 20 min. and it was better quality than Smoke dem Bones.  I was surprised being that Dickey's is a chain restaurant.  I will be ordering Dickey's from now on.  They are reliable, cheaper, and their food is just plain better!!!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously good food! Paul, the owner sat down and chatted with us for a little while. He had a lot of great stories!

I can't say enough about the food, authentic KC BBQ. The brisket is out of this world. 

Don't believe the haters, this place is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service/management.  I brought in a coupon purchased through a Groupon-like organization called RealLifePerks.  The coupon clearly states that there is no expiration.  The owner would not honor it because he no longer participates in the program.  Frankly, this is something between him and RealLifePerks and he should have honored the coupon.  I left Smoke Dem Bones dissatisfied and with a bad taste in my mouth.  I will not go back and no longer refer any of my BBQ-eating friends to them. Zero stars!"}
{"text":"I guess they delete bad reviews on here!! Because i did not like this place my boyfriend either. We came n ordered a oulled chicken sandwich and a hot link..  first the hot link was cut up into slices on a BURGER BUN!! The famous sauce taste like seasoned ketchup the pulled chicken had bones still in there almost bustin my tooth. It seems super fishy there. The owner was singing and eating at the table when we came in and hoped up when we pulled our money up. Very poor customer service i would never recommend anyone coming here. Oh n lets not DELETE this review too. Its not fair to lie to theses nice people with fake reviews"}
{"text":"Best takeout ribs!  Meaty and delicious beef ribs.  Delicious mac & cheese.  I wish I could review their peach cobbler, but it sells out so quickly that I've yet to try it.  This is a once a week staple for my family.  DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. My child and I were in the neighborhood & she was jonesing for some pulled pork bbq, so I came to Yelp. This place is right off the 51 near where we were and had high stars. It is very small & parking is in the back. Even my 9 year old was concerned since it wasn't much to look at but hey  Yelp seemed to think it was ok. So in we went.

It is very very small. Two men were inside watching the game. They thought I wanted take out but we wanted to be served. They seemed to be scramble to make that happen. The tables didn't seem very clean. We ordered lemonade & sweet tea, which were overly sweet.

My kid really wanted pulled pork BBQ so she ordered a sandwhich. It came with a side so she got coleslaw. I ordered a two meat platter with potato salad and mac & cheese. After 10 minutes the guy came back and said the pork wasn't cooked yet. I was very confused since usually that meat slow cooks for a really long time. So my kid changed her order to brisket, which I also ordered. The brisket was really chewy and didn't fall apart. My ribs were really good but a little too salty. My kid loved her sandwich, but they didn't bring her coleslaw. She had to go ask for it from them. The potato salad was runny as if it were copped into a bowl with water. The mac & cheese was good, though.

I ordered some hot links to go. When I ate them later that evening they were thinly sliced instead of full links and were like you'd find at Circle K. Quality was just bad.

When I went to pay the credit card machine did not work. I was about ready to just tell them I had no cash but I'm not that kinda guy. I happened to have $40 in my wallet so I paid in cash & left. I won't be back."}
