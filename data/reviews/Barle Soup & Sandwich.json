{"text":"We enjoyed our lunch at Barle. I had the Walnut Asian Salad which was rich with fresh fruit and vegetables -- yummy, filing and great presentation. My date had a sandwich with fruit salad on the side. The sandwich was also delicious.  Barle's commitment to fresh, high quality food is evident and impressive. As previous reviewers have noted, the restaurant is spacious and attractive and the patio in the back is a hidden gem.  Check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has great sandwiches and is the only make your own salad place on Lee Road. Great hidden patio. Located in a beautiful historic building with hidden patio.   Recommendations: Call in if you are ordering lunch to go (can take 15 minutes when busy).   Agree with Eric H. review not much else to add."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and so happy I walked in here. I'm tired of sloppy greasy burgers, so I thought I would do something different. The soup is fantastic along with the sandwiches. Sandwich comes in half or whole. Different soups everyday."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite lunch cafe in Cleveland Heights.  Great patio hidden in the back with tables set far apart around a tranquil garden & fountain.  Place an order at the counter & they deliver the food to your table.  In some places followup service lacks with this ordering style (*ahem* Panera), but Barle's friendly staff is on top of things, I've never had to get up for a refill.  Food is well above par, with gourmet sandwiches, salads and soups, as well as \"pick 2\" combos.  You can also create your own salad or sandwich from their extensive list of ingredients.   Haven't had the deserts yet, but they look delicious."}
{"text":"Great soup & sandwich place. I love all the sandwich choices. I have many family members with allergies, and it makes a big difference that we can all order EXACTLY what we can eat without a problem.  If you tell the staff you have allergies, they are extra careful with your order. When it comes, it's fresh, delicious, and the order is right.  That just doesn't always happen in chain stores."}
{"text":"After reading the menu selections, I had high hopes for this place.  I ordered 2 things:  the half sandwich half soup combo and a make-your-own salad.  The half sando was the pretzel melt.  Pretty standard and nothing overly impressive about it.  The tomato and ginger soup was VERY good.  My create-your-own salad was meh.  I was a little put off by the fact the woman who rang me up interrupted the transaction to take a phone call.  She asked another girl to take the rest of my order.  Really?"}
{"text":"haven't had an issue with a meat mix up since. i love this place! and the patio is exquisite. oh, and the curried cauliflower soup is my fall fav."}
{"text":"Yay, I'm first to review!  I was overall impressed with Barle Soup & Sandwich, a new shop that opened up on Mayfield and Lee. I'm happy that people are working hard to keep Rockefeller's brainchild alive.   The space was very beautiful, decorated with middle eastern rugs and a lot of expensive cardboard art of Cleveland + other cities. I think the theme that they were going for was more vintage, grandfather clock-y type of feel. There's a lot of space inside for meeting with friends, and possibly working. There's even a Thomas the Tank Engine playstation for the kiddos.  The best place is probably outside on the back patio, which faces a very well manicured mini garden. Sitting in the back reminds me of a really fancy Ivy League dorm, or a European patio. (Something about it also reminded me of Taiwan! Maybe the grids on the windows and more villa feel.)   As for the food, my friend calls it \"Panera but local.\" I say that it's Panera but local with less salt and better tasting food! I had an Indian soup with half a veggie sandwich. Yum. I'm going back for the barley soup though... I tried some of my friend's and that was definitely a winner.  another pro: they put slices of pineapple and cantelope in the water! How nice.  I'll be back at some point! Definitely a nice summertime lunch spot."}
{"text":"Delicious soup and sandwich combo"}
{"text":"I love love love this place; the food, staff and ambiance is stellar.   I've had their tuna on pretzel sandwich, many of their soups, salads and cookies and have never been disappointed.   However, I am extremely disappointed that they are closing in less than a week. They are a five minute walk from my home, which was another thing that I love about them.   They'll truly be missed."}
{"text":"This place is a good addition to the neighborhood.  Great for families! Food and service excellent. Great stuff for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! The restaurant is very clean and new. I like how I can see the kitchen and the cooks making the food. I ordered the club sandwich with a side salad and it was fantastic! I had a bite of my boyfriends barbecue chicken quesadilla and it tasted like nothing I've ever had before and was delicious. The price is great for the amount of good you get. I liked that it had an option of sitting indoors or outdoors. I recommend on a nice day sitting outside in the garden!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick lunch while visiting CLE, wanted something fresh and on the healthier side. We both got one of their delicious salads and split a vegan Oreo cookie that was absolutely TO DIE FOR!!! (And I'm not vegan, or vegetarian for that matter). I can't wait to come back, this will absolutely be one of my regular spots to grab a bite once I move!!"}
{"text":"I have passed this place a billion times on my way to work, but finally made it a point to finally stop in with my family.  We were not disappointed!  The triple cheese chicken melt is fantastic!  The soup du jour (pork chop barley) was perfectly seasoned and super tasty.  While it may be a bit pricey, I find that the atmosphere, excellent food, location, and commitment to local produce and sustainability will keep my coming back time and again."}
{"text":"Soup and salads are delish, and the place is all about the local community. Eat here now!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. My chop salad was a crunchy and delightfully fresh mid-day meal! The fresh avocado rounded out their culinary genius and kicked it up another level! They serve fresh fruited water and have an absolutely stunning garden space to enjoy it in! Overall, this is a great new place to add into my rotation and my tastebuds are grateful for their creative menu!   Can't wait to eat their again soon!"}
{"text":"I completely agree with other reviewers that the staff is extremely friendly and the atmosphere is great.  Being someone who loves flavorful food I was wholly disappointed in my grilled cheese with avocado and tomato on a pretzel roll and tomato & ginger soup.  Granted, none of these ingredients is spicey but my entire meal was just too bland for words.  Admittedly this same meal at Melt could be described as having too much sodium, but you've got to have at least a little flavor to even be considered for a second try.    As a side note, I also tried my friend's grilled cheese sandwich and it was similarly lacking in flavor.  On the positive side their Chinese cookies are absolutely amazing.  And this is my favorite type of cookie so I tend to be highly critical when it comes to taste testing them.  I'll go back because I haven't tried the salads and the vegan chocolate torte and plus I love supporting the local guys.  But I was so bummed that my meal was so bland.  On the plus side, if you have friends that like very plain, unspicey food, this place is a great spot to take them!"}
{"text":"What a great little place in Cleveland Heights!  Good sandwiches and new patio out the back of the building where you can sit under a huge tree in the shade and enjoy your meal.  Super friendly staff too!"}
