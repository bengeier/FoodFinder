{"text":"OK, so I had the $8.00 lunch. My first question was, what happened to these places??? Beyond the basic food, its filthy, food everywhere and the people, wow. I mean it looks like this is where obese people go to gorge. \"Oh, have a pint of ice cream and sugar to wash down that salad\" The lady in front of me was scooping some white-yellow pasta stuff out of the serving spoon with her fingers. The decor, whats with the baby shit green color and macro shots of tomatoes sweating? Tomatoes do not sweat. Oh and then some old lady in yoga pants. I mean, baggy yoga pants??? I had my salad and soup and left, the food was ok, but the patrons, leave you feeling no so good. So, if you want cheap nutrition and some OMG moments, go here."}
{"text":"I love super salad I eat there all the time I get coupons in the mail all the time and I eat there at least 6 times a month I love this super salad they are the nicest people in their they always keep the place clean and wiped the counter wiped off no matter how many people slop food everywhere everybody in there is great this place is so affordable you can't eat fast food as , inexpensive as you can eat there it's good for you there too a place you can eat for under $7 and eat healthy that's the last of our kind sincerely Mike"}
{"text":"By far the worse.... Cucumbers where bad, tacos tasted so weird I almost threw up! Nothing is fresh or has taste... Will never come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but have only ever gotten the salad to go. I work in the area and it's a great lunch, especially under 5 bucks. If you're like me, pressed for time and don't want a burger, this is the place. I'd say about 30% of the time i go, they're putting fresh vegetables out as i'm going down the line. Never see any empty trays.  Only complaint is twice they've had a new dressing, once was sweet onion something or other and i can't remember the second, but they were there just once then gone forever! Too bad, that onion one was good.  Just a reminder, it's not Sweet Tomatoes. The selection is smaller, but so is the check. Not nearly as crowded as there either."}
{"text":"This place was a disaster.  Not sure whats going on?  We have eaten there before and was good.  Tonight was awful.  Food looked old, out of several items, romain salad especially.  Salad bar was Messy with food scattered.  Tables were dirty, not being wiped after trays/plates retrieved.  One couple walked in, stood at the cash register for 5 min, no one was around, so they left.  Un freakin real.  What happen to souper salad!  You suck now!  Eew"}
{"text":"Generally speaking, I'm a fan of Souper Salad.  This location is basically just like all the other locations; the food is consistent, the restaurant is clean, the staff is relatively efficient.  However, It still lacks something.  Everyone here seemed so dispassionate, they were never rude; It just felt like none of the staff wanted to be there."}
{"text":"This location is my favorite.  We are always promptly greeted and made to feel welcome.  I've not had a bad server here yet.."}
{"text":"Best of the Souper Salads in the valley. Gotta get dat taco bar, son! There's plenty of buffet places but they're all so expensive I couldn't eat my moneys worth if I tried. You understand what I'm saying? I love soup. There's salad. Stay black NBC. Right, Gina Marooney?"}
{"text":"Those with the review that said they liked this place...have you been to Soup Plantation? Souper Salad...not so good! Soup Plantation - we absolutely love it! I would not go back to Souper Salad, unless someone begged me too. The broccoli cheese soup tasted like nacho cheese - yuck! Honestly, everything was just awful. I wished I had paid more for a nice salad at a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I are out here in Phoenix due to our son having special needs and he had a couple of surgeries at PCH and we are very blessed to have found this place to eat nothing but HEALTHY VEGAN/VEGETARIAN STYLE FOOD. THEY HAVE VEGAN SOUPS, LOWFAT, FAT FREE NO GMO DRESSINGS AND FOODS. It can't get any better than that. Staff is very friendly and on top of everything. We were surprised that they even had pizza with extremely THIN Flatbread full of vegetables. Excellent place to have vegans and vegetarians eat there. Amazing buffet pricing ABOUT $7 and some change per adult, all you CAN eat! This is definitely the place we will be going to All the time we are down here now. There are 3 locations and the Owner of the Restaurant Trevor is extremely friendly and polite. We actually have a blog about healthy eating and advocacy for parents and children with special needs called organicblogsandmore.blogspot.com. We started this up to help and serve other parents that have children with special needs. We are Available to bring justice and help to all families and people that need it. This blog spot also helps parents find the the help they need to get their children the programs and financial help the state is required to give them because of their child's condition that most parents aren't aware of.  SouperSalads is an Amazing place for people who love healthy eating like vegans and vegetarians. They have an array of leafy green salads and toppings like kidney beans, garbanzos beans, nuts, it's almost like it came out of a backyard garden, so fresh, THE NAME SAYS IT ALL SouperSalad!!        -Jassen,Judy and Kingston Cyphers        organicblogsandmore.blogspot.com"}
{"text":"Souper Salad is very much like a restaurant called Sweet Tomatoes located throughout the Southeast....same type of food fare and offerings.  My husband & I have enjoyed this location quite a few times.  He doesn't maintain much of an appetite because of health issues, but he made plenty of rounds each time we have visited so far.    Off the top of my head I cannot think of too many salad toppings/options that were NOT on the bar.  A very nice selection indeed.  As great as the pre-made summer salad was, it was raspberry dressing overkill in the batch I tried.  Second trip around I made my own version of the same thing.    Hot food items (potatoes, breads, pizza, soup) were really good for the most part.  However I strayed away from the veggie lasagna & taco meat offerings.  As much as I wanted to try the veg lasag, it seemed like it was a \"dump pan\" from where past multiple pans had been consolidated together.  The taco meat was swimming in grease, but then I dare you to tell me where taco meat doesn't swim in grease in any other restaurant.  I was disappointed when the tortilla holder was empty each time I tried to get one.  The Cherry Berry bread and the Gingerbread were absolutely to die for.  I could've just noshed on that alone and been happy. :)  The staff assisted us in getting my hubby navigated OUT of the busy restaurant (wheelchair-bound) by moving tables/chairs and holding the door.  All friendly staff, we were checked on throughout our visit by more than just one person."}
{"text":"Went for an early lunch on a Monday. Everything was fresh, place is clean, bright and inviting. Employees were friendly. I'm new to the area and will probably be visiting at least once a week."}
{"text":"Omg don't waste your money.  I will never return.  Salads were nasty lettuce was bad in some bowls.  Soups were all watered down.  The nacho chz was like it came from a powder. I can't even think of something good to say.  It wasn't even that clean."}
{"text":"The Souper Salad on 75 Ave and Bell Rd in Peoria AZ has to be the WORSE retaurant I ever visited.  Extremely slow service, food was not kept at proper temperature, what selections that were available, were not appealing at all and when attempted to eat it, it was HORRIBLE!  There was only one server on the floor who never came by to check on us, clean the table or offer more drinks.  The servers preparing the bar with food, were not friendly or very enthusiastic about helping anyone or filling the food bars with anything fresh or appetizing.  Will never, ever visit this establishment again!  They need to close this store before someone gets sick from food poisioning."}
{"text":"My wife and I were disappointed to discover this Souper Salad location just permanently closed.  It was one of our favorite options for a reasonably-priced and healthy buffet.  The food was always fresh and the staff courteous.  We want to thank the owners and many employees we met while eating there the past 17 years.  We will miss having you in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Super salad gave me a food baby. Good choices , fresh salads, good selections.  A place you can stuff yourself and not feel guilty about."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Me and my boyfriend came in on 5.99 Tuesday. Bad choice. It's very small and limited and not worth the money at all! The salad is standard but nothing to get excited about. Their lettuce looked somewhat questionable and i personally passed on some of the lettuce because it looked like it was sittin out too long.  As far as the soup, it was so questionable we passed on it completely. It looked gross and crusty.  There are some good sides like baked potatoes and breadsticks. But like I said nothing amazing. Super salads? HA! More like crappy salads! The people working there were very nice just the food was not worth it. Do not waste your money!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It was very clean and kid friendly. Showed up hungry, but not sure what I wanted, fortunately they had plenty of variety and everything I tried was great. Glad I stopped in and definitely plan to go back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"When I was a hungry student on the go, also on a limited budget, Souper Salad was my spot for a quick bite. It isn't the greatest quality, being a salad bar and semi-buffet, but it's cheap and fast...and they have Dr. Pepper. Oh yeah, baby...the close proximity to campus was also a plus. Be sure to bring cash though for a tip, they don't give cash back or have an atm machine."}
{"text":"Let me start with, I love Souper Salad, being going to them for at least 16 yrs... the problem I have it's with this location by Metro Mall... seriously dirty, the floors, the tables...the booth, nasty.  I can't even imagine what the kitchen looks like.  I just can't do this place ever again.  Either the people there just don't care about cleaness because is still a good price, or they just as nasty.  This Souper Salad needs help bad --- remodeling, cleaning and nice people to work, cause the waitress we got was either not happy to be there or plainly just a b - i - t %&^^ you get my point."}
{"text":"A really great place if you have a short time for lunch and want to eat healthy.  Some of the old locations in (and around Mesa) closed around 2009, but the one on 6910 E. Hampton in Mesa is doing great and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"just had at souper salad last week and had bad experience. I am a vegetarian and was horrified to find meat in my veggie soup. I double checked and sign did say \"vegetarian\". I brought it to the notice of my server who did nothing but say \" i am not sure..i didnt make it\". Well, now i know how they can afford a 6$ buffet...by sacrificing on quality of food.  Never gonna go there again."}
{"text":"What are you in the mood for?  I truly suggest this place if you're looking for grade D salad and such AND if you want to leave in a clinically depressed state of mind.  Pros:  All you can eat  Cons:  Why in the world would you want more than a bite????? Every different lettuce bowl contained gross amounts of browning greens.  While the spinach looked and tasted fresh, the romaine was not, the parmesan was the kind that resembles anthrax or cocaine, the dressing was uber-salty and quite disgusting, the bacon bits contained no trace of pig, and there was no protein other than cubed ham to be found.    While I can see how the entire soup/salad/pasta/fruit/pizza/ice cream/tacos? package might be worth $7 and change, this was a horrible buy for a person looking for a salad with some ample protein.  When your name contains the word \"salad,\" don't you think you should offer some good greens?"}
{"text":"For a place that just opens pre-made packages and plops them on a salad-bar, I would think that this effort might not have been to challenging. Perhaps I had my hopes up too high.  I went here for a quick bite as I had business in the neighborhood. I must say, I would have done better anywhere else. The salad selection was less than fresh to say the least. A person kept barging out of the back to refill things, and was super surley. Just get in her way and get an elbow.  After the salad selection are random canned things. I guess those were ok. I am not sure.  They also have a \"hot bar\". This is where things get really depressing. They had a kind-of taco set-up thing going with what appeared to be ground beef. Except it wasn't! It was straight-up textured vegetable protein! Who even does that? I got a baked sweet potato, and that thing had been sitting under a heat lamp for what seemed weeks and was inedible. The soups were just blah. Who serves french onion soup without the topping? The pizzas they had on the platter were less than what you would expect from the cheapest of frozen pizzas.  Just all in all horrible. I left having drank and unsweetened ice tea and left a plate from the all-you-can-eat salad bar totally full.  What a waste of time and money. This place is gross."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many Souper Salads, but I wasn't too impressed by this location.  I understand they have a lot of customers, and not much staff, but but they should find some way to improve some things.  First of all, there have been several times when I have walked in, and no one is at the counter. Once, when my family arrived, we had to serve ourselves, then find the cashier afterward to pay, because they didn't arrive at the register until after we had sat down to eat. Because of this very lax staffing, I've seen several people walk in through the door, and go straight to the seats or the bathroom. I don't know if they were trying to sneak in a free meal, but there was nothing stopping them if they were.  Secondly, they don't clean the tables too often. I'm sure it's related to the small staff, but it's also not usually a problem because there's so much seating.  Usually you cut staff to save money, but if you lose customers to dirty tables, no one being at the register when they arrive, or simply too many people sneaking in to steal food, it might be more profitable to have sufficient staff."}
{"text":"Had lunch. Best price for the quality of salad bar and soups. I mean, if you know you are paying 7.00 for all you can eat. I didnt see anything that was scary looking as in freshness. They had soup (4), nacho fixin's, breadsticks, and dessert. Great price for what you get..."}
{"text":"I am so upset with this souper salad. They are never consistent with their food. I love the pizza but the last 3 times I have gone they have always been out of it. The service is TERRIBLE! It takes the servers take atleast 10 minutes to bring out drinks..they take their sweet time to refill too. This souper salad is never crowded, never busy. I don't see what the problem is. But the straw that broke the camels back is when I went there last weekend and the pound cakes used for the strawberry sauce was replaced by undesireable chunks of a hard biscuit thing. Ugh. I will never return to this establishment again. Consistency is key here, and they are consistent at being bad."}
{"text":"Loved this souper salad! By far the best one. Looks wise is gorgeous. Nice and clean and new. Better then the other one I was going to on stapley and the 60 ( whatever you do, don't go)   The staff was super friendly. I even got a to-go cup free to take home with me.   The food display was gorgeous. Lot more veggies in the salad.. Good pasta, amazing pizza!   They also had a really good tiny section to make your own lil icecreams. But the strawberry shortcake is always my favourite.   A big thanks to Rand H. for going to this place and making a good review. He is the king of buffetts lol.   I will be coming to this souper salad once a week. I'm so glad it's here!"}
{"text":"Note: this review is for the Metro Center location only. I love Souper Salad generally.  Unlike others, I have no problems with the food quality or cleanliness here. What I have a problem with is the staff, and the management that trains them (or at least lets them get away with) harassing their customers to such a great extent that I LITERALLY REFUSE TO GO TO THIS LOCATION ANYMORE.  I love salad bars. I spread myself out among them in Central Phoenix because, well, I don't much care for being treated like a regular. This used to be one of the ones I would frequent because it was close, but not anymore.  Understand something right out of the gate, and understand it well: THIS IS A BUFFET. When I go through a line and BUILD MY OWN MEAL, you, as a member of a supposed \"waitstaff\" are a bit behind the 8-ball. I'll leave a tip, but not because of how many times you interrupt my meal to remind me that you're there (which they are way too fond of doing at this place), I'll leave a tip if you quietly take my dishes away when I'm finished and leave me alone to read my book. Can you not see that I'm reading a freaking book? And that I'm really enjoying reading said book?   Alas, no. You WILL be interrupted. You won't be interrupted in that brief, helpful way, either - you will be asked to disengage from whatever else you might be doing and give your undivided attention to your \"server,\" who wants you to know he is there to help you, should you need anything, here in this BUFFET restaurant where you GET UP AND GET EVERYTHING FOR YOURSELF. \"Hey there, boss!\" (oh god, don't call me boss). \"How's it goin' today, eh?\" \"Hmm... yeah. that's great, hey - just want ya to know -  I'm [insert name here] and I'll be your waiter today. OK? Now I know that [insert other name here] was just over here talking to you, but I'm your actual waiter. OK? So if you need anything, you know - you just let me know!\" *winks* *makes hand motion like firing a pistol accompanied by clicking tongue noise*  You'll be my waiter? Waiter for WHAT? You're not a waiter, you're just a douchebag.  Oh but here, unlike Sweet Tomatoes, they have one in: they have no fountain, so they have to go get you your drink from the back. You see what they did there? Just like magic, they made waiters out of these glorified busboys. The thing is, what you ordered to drink is written on your ticket. They can (and at other locations they do) simply read your ticket and get your drink - and then keep it full. But no, they don't do that here. Here, they always want to have a conversation. Now, you might be fooled for a millisecond into thinking you can get around this, because at the register they offer chilled bottled water. Surely they have no reason to interrupt my meal and introduce themselves and find out what my name is and if I need a backrub and do I have kids and pets and what is the password to my yelp account, right? Wrong.  \"Can I get you a glass of ice?\"  A glass of ice. For my chilled bottled water. Come hell or high water, they WILL find a way to interact with you and remind you that they are there and you have a \"server\" and (by extension, of course) that you should leave a tip. Obviously, you're too thoughtless to do so otherwise.   Yeah, sorry, I think  I'll go elsewhere instead. At Sweet Tomatoes the worst that can happen is they'll bug you about joining their stupid club, but at least they aren't under the illusion that you can be treated like you're a waiter when you DON'T ACTUALLY DO ANY FREAKING WAITING.   Knuckleheads.  I haven't had coffee this morning... yeah, that's gotta be it."}
{"text":"This place is alright. The staff is friendly. It's nothing special, but then again it's a buffet. The food just wasn't that good. The salad bar toppings were fresh, but the lettuce / spring mix was very wilted. The pizza, mac n cheese, and tacos were horrible. It just tasted really cheap. Not that I expect the world from a buffet, but anything you could've made out of box at home would taste significantly better. The ice cream (or frozen yogurt) machine was out of service. That happens anywhere from time to time, so not really discounting the rating for that. On a bright note the strawberry short-cake was awesome, and the staff was very fast to clear the tables. All in all, I am sure I won't come back here for a long time. It's a great deal, but the compromise on the food wasn't at all worth it."}
{"text":"It's not the Rio buffet, but it's fine for what it is: a decent salad and soup bar, especially at $6.49 a person.  I'm not sure what the previous reviewer expected for that price.  Four soups, several pastas, and lots of salad items, plus pizza and potatoes.    Mushrooms could've been fresher, and soft serve was too soft.  On the other hand soft drinks (extra $) had free refills and you could take a refill with you."}
{"text":"Two of the the soups look like they've been sitting there all day your server never even greets you or gets anything for you so why tip?"}
{"text":"Super Salad is predictable. The food is good, the selection is fair in comparison to other buffets but I find myself draw to Souper Salad because it is the same. I know exactly what I want and exactly where it is before I even get to the restaurant. The price is right, the wait staff is pleasant and ponschual. I'm meeting a friend there today."}
{"text":"This was the best souper salad I've been too.  Staff was attentive and kept everything really clean and food filled. I was happy with experience and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"So ingredients were pretty fresh for the salad.  I wish the eggs weren't all crumpled (probably the wrong word) together.  Overall for all you can eat and $7, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I was totally disappointed with this place. It was dirty. The food wasn't very good at all,(except for the lentil soup) especially for the price. Our waitress had the personality of a wet paper bag. Drinks were over filled and spilling all over the table. The waitress just left the mess she made for is to clean up.  All and all it was a good thing we came here today. We saved a dog from heat exhaustion or possibly worse. (had to call the police)An older couple was here and left their golden retriever in the car as they sat in the A/C for dinner. It was 102 degrees today. SMH"}
{"text":"The main -- and huge -- advantage of this place is that it's much healthier than other fast food option, or it can be.  It mainly depends on choices you make.  But the healthy options far outweigh the not so healthy ones.  Such a large variety that, for the price, I don't think it can be beat.    My parents go once a month or so, and I'm glad they choose this over various other possibilities. A good place for kids too.  The one negative thing is the high salt content in the soups."}
{"text":"We were in the area and got hungry so we decided to stop in for a bite to eat. I have been to others in the past and they were very good so this one should be the no different right? Wrong! The food was good especially the veggie soup, but the service was honestly the worst I have EVER experienced and I dine out a lot! The waiter completely ignored us other than bringing our drinks out at the beginning of our meal. Dirty plates were left there the entire time, and looking around I noticed the same happening elsewhere. After a group of customers would leave the restaurant he would eventually -get to it- and grab the stack of plates he'd left on their tables. The rest of the time he was too busy flirting with the cashier and waitress to even refill our drinks. At the end of our dinner we got up and left without leaving a tip, mind you I have NEVER done this, and all of the plates we had used were still on the table- empty glasses and all. We walked outside and our attention was drawn back inside for a glance at what we thought was about to take place- we made a friendly wager on the way to the car.. My wife won the bet- after a few minutes he walked out and over to the cashier's station to continue flirting, glanced over at our table, as to see if we'd left a tip, and continued his conversation without any reguard for other patrons or concern with cleaning it off. I wouldn't want to clean it up either had I not got any tips all day. Also when we first left the cashier wasn't even in the front at the register, maybe in the back with the waiter, because it seemed he followed out right behind her a few minutes later- like a little lost puppy. I have never had service this poor and I'm willing to bet those plates are still sitting there. Not really but you see my point. Good food HORRIBLE service! I won't be back, at least not to this location."}
{"text":"It's a buffet, what do you expect?  If you are expecting any one thing to be awesome, then you shouldn't be going to a buffet.  As buffets go, everything was pretty good.  Although not as wide a selection as Old Country or Sizzler, they are only about half the price of those places.  Great deal.  My kids loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! So many options of healthy food I love it! And for the cost of McDonald's! Great spot and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"It's like a blue collar \"Sweet Tomatoes\".  Smaller selection but lower prices.  Everything is fresh and well presented.  Quiet atmosphere.  Clean store.  Friendly staff.  You don't feel rushed like at some other buffet restaurants.  A nice place to enjoy a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"I should have read all the reviews before sitting down to eat.  Well it was 5:30pm on a Sat night so you would assume that everything would be fresh.    Shame on me for assuming things.   The soups were horrible and looked they had being sitting there all week.  The pizza wasn't even pizza but crust with sauce on it.   The iceberg lettuce was a mixture of lettuce with chunks not even cut up yet.  I love Souplantation/ Sweet Tomatoes and I have high standards for anyone else tryiing to be a Salad Buffet.      I would have given this place a half a star but the manager was nice enough to refund my money so it gets one star."}
{"text":"This staff is outstanding, very polite and courteous.  It's hard to find good quality service people.  The cashier was busy but turned to me and apologized and said he would be right with me, which he did.  Layla my server was smiling the whole time, and checked on me with reasonable time in between, at times some servers are over attentive or non existent.  The place was busy but everything stayed stocked and was fresh.  My hats off to the management and staff for making this a pleasant visit for my first time, at this location.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Not bad for an all you can eat soup and salad place. You ask; why not just eat at a buffet in a casino that offers more than just salads? I guess it is for the atmosphere, casinos do get crowded and the wait can be crazy at times.Decent items for $6+ (lunch) nothing fancy. They also have pizzas, baked potato, tacos, nachos and a variety of pasta dishes. It reminds me of a cheaper version of sweet tomatoes."}
{"text":"I used to come here with my mother back a few years, and it used to be much better. But my latest visit, I brought a friend that had never been before. I was a little embarrassed due to the soup being lukewarm, not hot, the bread was cold, and the baked sweet potatoes were smaller than my palm--- and I have small hands. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Meh..... This is near the Metro mall...which is being remodeled and expanding to include a WalMart. This is important, because this little dive could invest in their business (remodel bathrooms, refresh the entrance) and attract mall traffic because of their excellent location.  It's a buffet style restaurant. The food on the buffet was okay, but this place charges extra for meat! That's right! If you want grilled chicken for example, it's $2 more! Really??!   Suggestion to management: throw the grilled chicken on your buffet. I realize that would increase your buffet cost, but it's needed. Your buffet had nothing special going on.  When you charge me $2 for a drink, $7.95 for the buffet, you are already at a lunch price point.   Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be back. But this restaurant is a good location; but there are a lot others around it..."}
{"text":"I feel bad about giving this place two stars... really.  Last sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.  We approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing.   Their pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.  I loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it.   The cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one.   The service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star.   To my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot. You might need to shoo away the owner though in order to get some privacy and enjoy the people you arrive there with."}
{"text":"This Mesa location for Souper Salad has undergone drastic improvements in the last month or so, and I would like to compliment them on a job well done. Gone are the greasy tables and dirty heat lamps, the permanently ill staff coughing on the dinner trays, the poorly laid-out floor plan and the perennially dirty windows. Now the place is open, inviting, and full of sunlight and air. Yes, it's closed now and the doors are locked, but think of the favor they've done you--now you can't eat there if you tried!"}
{"text":"I received an e-mail from the manager saying that they now have a brand new ice cream machine.  I can't wait to give it a try and bump my rating back to 4 *'s. Thanks for answering my cranky Yelp."}
{"text":"Our first time at this location. The soup they advertise was out. The mushrooms were brown & the food was very plain. The bread rolls tasted store bought. What soups they did have were terrible. The floor and salad bar was dirty. We're not impressed."}
{"text":"Oh gosh, where to start.  First off, trough dining is not usually my thing.  Places that require a sneeze guard kind of turn me off.  With that said, it's not like I am a complete stranger to the buffet restaurant concept and know a good one from a bad one, and Souper Salad is BAD.    To put it another way, my 2 year old dining companion wouldn't even touch the food.  That is saying a lot.  So, for those first time Souper Salad people (this was my first trip), you start with the salad bar, then to the table and then you can select \"hot\" food, soups and desserts.  The lettuce was passable, but not really that fresh and crisp which is strange from a place with Salad in the title.  The topping choices were okay, not great (dill pickle chips???), the mixed salads were decent and then there were the obligatory canned puddings.  I passed on the soup as it didn't look appealing.  The \"hot\" food was all lukewarm and super gross looking.  Super gross.  The soft serve and oreos were good though:)   I'm sure nothing at Souper Salad is made on premises, it is merely warmed up or dished out.  There really is just  a feeling that they don't try very hard - and it shows."}
{"text":"I give it three stars because of the service. I love the staff but am not in love with the food. I have frequented here but lately the food has been less than satisfactory.  The tortilla soup didn't taste as good as usual and the ice tea had a significant aftertaste that wasn't desired. I do repeat how much I love the service as the staff is always more than welcome."}
{"text":"This salad bar restaurant is okay. I can't even stress to people enough though that this is on the polar opposite end of Sweet Tomatoes both in quality of food and selection and they are about the same price. The selection here is a lot smaller and you can tell that the quality of produce isn't as high. Also, the bread selection looks like something that they just pulled out of the freezer. I will eat here on occasion with colleagues if we really want a salad bar lunch."}
{"text":"I live in Chandler and they closed down my local Souper Salad.  I was sooo incredibly sad as this was one of the weekly places I visited!!  The closet thing we have is a Sweet Tomatoes... I popped in once in hopes that it would be somewhat similar.  Never going back again. :(  Fortunately, I discovered the Souper Salad Superstition location which is near my friends home.  I will definitely be frequenting this place!  P.S.  Please come back to Chandler!"}
{"text":"Agreeing with the last review,no this is not sweet tomatoes. However, it is also less expensive than S.T. Plus i had a coupon for here. It is still very good in their own way. They have a lot of salad options and you can make yourself a lovely salad. They do have soup and Tacos,along with potatoes and all sorts of bread.   The food is good and there is plenty of  desserts.  My issue is with the cleanliness of it all. When i came in 3:04pm There were only a few people in the restaurant.  However, many of the tables were dirty and full of dishes. When i did find an empty booth with no dishes i noticed it was still dirty. I wiped it off myself. That was i bit under standards. However, it was cheap and you usually get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love to go to lunch at off times when  they are not so busy. This was the case on Friday.  I had a fantastic coupon and the waiter that rang me up said he would even make me a fresh pot of coffee. I did not even have to ask.  The salad was wonderful! I really liked how fresh every thing was. Soup a bit so so,but they even had tacos and they were really good. It was very nice and clean inside. My waiter brought me lots of fresh coffee, i was very happy."}
{"text":"Super duper friendly service, but I am here to eat, and it is mediocore food at best."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to go for some good Souper Salad! Located in the Heart of Phoenix and one of the last GOOD soup, salad with all the fixings restaurant. So much more than a Salad Buffet for sure!  Great value and an endless buffet that has soup bar, fresh salads, baked potato bar, taco bar, and love the chili.  Friendly staff, management and one of the CLEANEST Restaurants I have been to in Phoenix.   Craving a simple meal that is still a great price for a buffet, check out Souper Salad - Chef Approved"}
{"text":"This place looks great after their remodel. The salad bar was amazing and the food tasted great. Clifford, our server, was super nice and helpful. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The kids love going to these places! The salad bar is decent & the chicken noodle soup is good. The customer service is really good!  Our table was kept clean the entire time we were there. The buffet was stocked with fresh stuff as well. I am sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Souper Salad I've been to here in AZ.  I went to this place with my husband and my 21 yr old son.  I was starving!  Once we sat down to eat.  My son had a pasta salad that had pieces of chicken.  To my amazement he was using a knife to cut something that was in this salad.  Then when this item wouldn't cut he used his fork to pull up this item from his salad.  We all freaked out!  It was a thin white rubber glove.  We couldn't see it because it blended in with the white sauce and white pasta and white chicken pieces.  I was soooo disgusted after this, I couldn't eat my meal.  We called the manager over, he appoligized and said he can only refund my son's plate.  Once we got this we left with left this place with disgust.  Never again will I ever go back to this place.  Ever since I experienced I've reluctantly go to buffets now."}
{"text":"Always like coming here although today the cheese and broccoli soup was really salty but everything else was on point. Staff is friendly and helpful. Thanks..."}
{"text":"Nice and clean. Fresh salads with about anything you want. Great choice of lo-cal dressings. Bread sticks soup is very good. Ate here 3 other times in the last week. Busy and fresh."}
{"text":"OK....so it's a bona fide feed trough.  Better to bring your avarice and appetite here, and get a few veggies."}
{"text":"I'va always been a fan of SS but this past friday went there with roomie & a friend, very nice staff at this location, fast friendly service, all the food was fresh, clean place etc...one thing i am very happy about is that they ditched most of their pasta & fish taco things...they usually werent the freshest things, so i guess SS went back to their roots and they are better for it"}
{"text":"OK....so it's a bona fide feed trough.  Better to bring your avarice and appetite here, and get a few veggies."}
{"text":"Souper Salad reminds me of a restaurant called Sweet Tomatoes that I used to frequent in Orlando.  While not as clean-looking and with not as many different options on their buffet, Souper Salad does the trick when you're looking for a decent salad bar and/or someplace to take the kids.    We were there just recently on a dreary, overcast weekday for lunch and had a decent meal that filled us up for the rest of the day.  You can't go wrong with a big salad bar because if you screw it up, it's your own fault, being the assembler and all.    Their soups are just okay, but every once in awhile, there's a standout one.  The chicken enchilada soup this past week was outstanding.  There was so much flavor in each spoonful that I wanted the recipe.   Souper Salad also has some generic pastas, cheesy pizzas,  baked potatoes with a topping bar (that I can never get to after filling up on soup and salad), and an ice cream machine with a few toppings to cap off your meal.    Don't expect a lot from Souper Salad (and don't be silly and use this as a date place), but all in all, it's a decent place to catch a good (and occasionally healthy) meal.  Sundays can be crazy here -- the church crowd uses this as a gathering place and kids meals are offered super (souper?) cheap."}
{"text":"once again Rand H. talked me into one of the rabbit food buffet's to start with i skipped right by all the lettuce salads and found some sausage and red bean soup and it was really good. I then ventured back up to the rabbit food. I chose to try the pasta salads (3 of them)and they were all good I also had two different potato salads that were also very tasty.As far as meat goes the choices are limited but they have a big pan of taco meat (browned hamburger)and all the taco fixings.I also had the vegetable lasagna it was alright. Then it was on to the sweets,always my favorite part of a meal. They have some cubed angel food cake which I put into a bowl and then added vanilla pudding and strawberries topped with whipped cream( yum) it was so good i went back and made another one,Then i had some soft serve ice cream with chocolate syrup,the soft serve was watery and not to good but it was the only thing i had that was below par."}
{"text":"another rabbit food buffet !!! But as usual Souper Salad does it fairly good. I liked the potato salad with the skin on. soups were good , thats where the meat is. And of coarse i will have to mention the strawberry shortcake i built on a large plate yumm yumm , I am usually between three and four stars on these salad buffets but drop down to three because of the meat factor. If i was a rabbit they would get five stars ."}
{"text":"Not a great selection,  but cheaper than sweet tomato.  I wouldn't come here without a coupon,  honestly,  but it was decent.  Good service.  I didn't like finding dirt on my green onions (after I felt crunch in my mouth), but they disposed of the green onions,  and put out new ones that were washed more properly.  Still, gross! That should have been washed properly,  someone could get sick. Needless to say, I lost my appetite"}
{"text":"A long time (four months) ago, before I moved to Phoenix, I would drive up I-17 and wonder what the ugly building on my left was.  Little did I know that it would be one of my go-to spots for a quick lunch!  I've always appreciated  the no frills simplicity of Souper Salad and this particular location is no exception.  The salad bar has always been fresh for me, the rotating soup selection is quite good and the bread is tasty.  Heck, even the pizza is decent.  What really makes Souper Salad shine for me are the deals!  Tuesdays are two for one and there are almost always coupons for similar deals.  I can't remember the last time I paid full price.  It's not fancy and it's not pretty, but the food and pricing are good.  I'll keep going to Souper Salad as long as I work in the area."}
{"text":"We've been here several times over the last 2-3 years.  It's gotten progressively worse each visit.   It's now to the point where it's disgusting.   We'll not go back.  Squeezing every dollar from this location has worked to the detriment of food quality and taste.   YUCK!  Spend your money elsewhere, like Sweet Tomatoes, a little more expensive but far better quality!"}
{"text":"I prefer sweet tomatoes however they were having a lunch special for $7.99. How can you beat that, I spend more at a drive through. Normal lunch price is $10 I believe. At normal price definitely go to sweet tomatoes."}
{"text":"Favorite salad bar in the universe. Date night with the biological leaves me feeling satisfied every time"}
{"text":"Huge variety of fresh salads, fruits, soups and some other delicacies and all for only 8 bucks. Place is not really welcoming but it's clean and the service is OK. I'm not a fan of buffets but this one is recommendable!"}
{"text":"I love going here for lunch. The choices are great and the price is so reasonable! I especially love their breadsticks! They have the BEST soup options too everyday."}
{"text":"Its alright, I think they are better then Sweet Tomatoes. They offer more variety then Sweet tomatoes and they are cheaper. You get a coupon for Souper salad, then i would go here."}
{"text":"My first visit here 10/13/15. 11am.   Inside, the restaurant was clean, well stocked salad bar. Total cost with tax for one trip down the salad bar and a drink-to-go, $10.68.  The ranch dressing had almost no flavor. The veggie soup was bland, had about as much taste as a bowl of soup with half a beef bullion cube added, then some of yesterday's veggies from the salad bar tossed-in. The cheese with noodles soup with tiny chunks of ham tasted like it had sugar in it.  I doubt I'll return.   The staff were friendly. Oddly enough, the entrance faces the street, not the parking lot. Easy access off Hampton or Power Rd. Then you take the hike around to the south side of the building to walk in the only door which is on the wrong side of the building."}
{"text":"Why is it so difficult to find a decent salad bar here in PHX? This place doesn't cut it- Its overpriced, and the food besides the salad is mediocre at best. Besides that, the salad items are very generic, nothing stands out as being original, unique or different. Skip it."}
{"text":"Clean and fast. Your not bothered and its a nice selection of food. Can eat healthy and hearty with no problems."}
{"text":"Not sure how to describe this place other than average in certain areas and below par in other areas. The salad section has all the usual ingredients and they were fresh and well-stocked right after the lunch rush. I could clearly make a great salad and they had fat-free dressings which is good for my health kick of late. Once you get beyond the salads, your kind of on your own with more misses than hits. The soups were unimpressive that day, sans for a semi-decent beef vegetable soup, but the rice in the chicken rice soup was way overcooked and mushy. Then you had all the salads that were loaded down with mayo - about five of them, none of which looked appetizing. Baked Potatoes, mac n chese, tacos, cracker pizza , all of these should be eaten at your own risk. Most of the bread didn't cut the mustard either, except for an average garlic breadstick. Desert was the usual stuff like jello and pudding and frozen ice cream? from the ole machine. At $6 with a coupon, there is nothing wrong with going here for a good salad, but beyond that, it seems like a crapshoot."}
{"text":"This place was an oasis of hospitality after a terrible day of travel. The food was delicious and Kris the manager is a great guy who made our meal a true pleasure with his friendly attitude. I'd eat here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Not amazing, but decent food for the price.  The employees are friendly enough and it is usually never too crowded.  They always keep the buffet well stocked."}
{"text":"It's pretty good and not expensive. There are always coupons available online. They have some really great breads! Soup is thin but has great flavor."}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest, Hubby and I went here because we wanted to check out  the cool building. And we like Sweet Tomatoes well enough, so we braved it in spite of some mediocre reviews. Let's just say I wasn't sure how fresh the lettuce was and if the cheese was real. No refills on drinks were offered while we were there. The selection was similar to Sweet Tomatoes, but lower quality. The soups didn't look great, so neither of us tried one- and they were different from what the website said they would be. The breads were ok, with the stand-out being the clearly from a mix cheesy drop-biscuit. Kinda sad. The pasta sauces looked off-color and the pizza appeared underdone and topped with cheap (again- real???) cheese. The desserts were alright- Hubby liked his non-dairy iced product in a cone well enough and I actually rather liked my strawberry shortcake. The inside of the building was not as cool as the outside, with some scary dust and water damaged panels in parts of the multi-layered ceiling. We asked the hostess what it had been before  and she said it had been a bank in the 70's. I managed to stop myself from quipping, \"Well you can bank on us not returning.\""}
{"text":"This location needs some serious overhauling. Buffet rehab perhaps. They had four soups, but only the Garden Vegetable was edible. Jalapeno and cornbread was just too weird and Onion soup was overflowing with Dill. The fourth soup was chicken something, but too creamy and not white meat. The ice cream is not ice cream, it is some fake form of the product and there are no toppings available. The mac and cheese is inedible and the grease is flowing atop the taco meat which will get your stomach churning instantly. Nacho cheese sauce and salads loaded with mayo do not help the cause. The cornbread is cold and the garlic sticks have no flavor. They have enough veggie and dressings to make a decent salad, but that is about all that is good and the price is reasonable at seven bucks. Chicken is extra money, which is nonsense, it is like an airline now at this buffet, everything ala carte. Head to the bigger chain which tries harder."}
{"text":"Going to UNLV you can either eat on campus which is gross, or eat at chipotle or seven eleven....Get in your car and drive down the street and your options are a little more open. Souper Salad is right on the corner of Maryland and Flamingo and it is an option for an inexpensive lunch quickly. The quality is not great and there are other options around the same area that are I think more of a value, but great for its purpose."}
{"text":"This place has terrible food and an attitude to match, I heard the owners gossip about customers behind closed doors and even joked about spitting in their soup because they didn't tip well before.   I'd hate to think what they do in the kitchen to the food since most of it tastes like plastic anyways."}
{"text":"I love salads, soups, and bread, period.  So its hard to mess up a restaurant that serves these three things. For a $7 buffet, the bar is set pretty low anyway.  But Souper Salad well exceeded my mediocre expectations on my first (and subsequent) visits.    The salad bar is one of the best salad bars I've seen.  You have a choice between three \"bases\"-Caesar salad, iceberg lettuce with carrots and cabbage, or some romaine base with walnuts.  Then you can add topping to heart's delight.  I've never seen wilted lettuce or less-than-fresh toppings, so I'm already impressed.  The soups are pretty good as well.  I love the vegetable beef (which is a staple) and the bread sticks are comparable to Olive Garden.  I've never felt daring enough to get a taco, something about looking at the seasoned ground meat in large quantities makes me queasy.  The self-serve ice cream is way too sweet, but who needs ice cream after pigging out on salad and bread sticks?    The staff are friendly and generally keep drinks refilled.  Yeah, its a little impersonal and not particularly charming, but what would you expect from a chain salad buffet?  If you're tired of the fast food circuit in Matthews, Souper Salad is a nice diversion."}
{"text":"I can't make any arguments for atmosphere, nor would I compare this to a J Alexanders or other higher-level chain, but I got a decent lunch here for $7.   I try not to eat salads in public because it is a frightening site; i basically fill a bucket with salad ingredients and stick my face in. Only my closest friends and relatives have seen me eat a real salad. god help them. Anyway, I tried not to be a complete disaster at Souper Salad, but it was hard. The salad bar is pretty extensive with vegetarian friendly garbanzo beans and just about every vegetable i've ever seen. (ooh they didn't have jicama, and they should.)   After I piled up a plate of leafy and non leafy greens I headed to the soup area where Souper Salad very responsibly lists all the ingredients in their soups, especially noting the vegetarian friendly options. I went for the lentil soup and was not disappointed. some lentil soups are no more than lentils floating in warm water, but this was flavorful. There are also hot baked potatoes, macaroni and cheese and other homey food offerings for Souper Salad diners. I made off with a tiny cheese roll.   There are also some dessert options like soft serve ice cream or chocolate pudding and fresh fruit. Nothing wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Souper Salad is good as buffets go. Nice assortment of salads and soups and the servers are pleasant. Best part is the ginger bread and soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"All I gotta say is....  To-go Salad a la carte 4 buck and some change...get a container that's seriously big enough for enough salad to last me lunch and dinner. Good salad toppings and what not. I stick to the breadsticks...the rest of the breads a little dry."}
{"text":"I love this place. And the spaceship/rack of lamb building is so cool looking.  As a vegetarian I can eat almost everything except 2 out of 4 soups.  This isn't an incredibly lavish buffet with carved meats and such, more focuses on the salad bar.  Everything is fresh and re-stocked often.  Soups are great- esp lentil. I also like that cold pasta with corn. There's also some pizza, muffins, nacho and baked potato with fixings.  The only thing not yummy is the soft serve ice cream- it's icy and not like ice cream.  The price of about $8 is amazing.  Remember to tip your table busser a buck or 2. True, it's serve yourself, but still- they keep it clean and smile a lot."}
{"text":"Souper F-ing good!! This place was simply a surprise! We've been to buffets but this one was really good! huge salad on my side and then there is pizza and soups and tacos and pasta and baked potatoes! I usually eat my weight there. I suggest you go there and try."}
{"text":"Found Soupersalad and we love coming here! They just reopened after a major remodel and it's so clean and open!! We tell everyone to come here for delicious salad and tacos, soups and ice cream with toppings!! Great price and staff is very friendly and helpful!! We'll be there 2-3 times a week"}
{"text":"The salad buffet place with the circular architecture reminiscent of Van de Kamp's restaurants is my favorite place for a quick, satisfying meal in the MetroCenter area. The place is clean, brightly lit and very spacious, and the staff is very friendly. The food choices are typical for a salad buffet, with lots of fresh cut veggies, different cold pastas and other starches, including a wild rice dish during my most recent visit. The soups are hearty and the hot items section include several breads, pizza, and tacos. Desserts include fresh fruit, pudding, build-your-own strawberry shortcake, and soft-serve ice cream. A lot of good fresh cold or hot food for people on a budget."}
{"text":"If you're coming here expecting it to be like it used to you'll be slightly disappointed.  No more spicy or regular peanuts, no more real bacon bits,  no more spring mix,  watered down taco meat (too greasy),  watered down chili, no more Warm bread (just sitting out exposed to whatever little kids and other people might expose it to),  no more real butter on 'potato bar',  watered down cheese sauce (gross now!), soups aren't good any more and don't taste homemade like they used to... Seriously obvious they're cutting corners now.   Sweet Tomatoes or Sizzler for me from now on instead of here.  Just found out why... It has a new franchise owner."}
{"text":"We ended up here because my friend wanted to eat something less greasy and fried so I said sure why not? Nothing wrong with a little veggie feast every now and again. If you are a veggie lover or a senior looking for a place to eat where it is not crowed then this may be the spot for you. It is true that this and the location in Phoenix I went to suffer from lack of choice issues. It is also one of the main problems I have with this place.  Once we walked in I took a look around and noticed very few people  were actually eating here, in fact the place seemed like it was ready to close down. The price for the lunch buffet is high given the lack of options they offered (four kinds of soup, salad bar, cheese pizza, a few desserts and a rather small bread selection). The bread was not hard but was not fresh either and they even went so far as to cut the bread sticks in half LOL who does that? Can I not have a whole bread stick?  I am sure there are those out there who love this place but I am not one of them. Limited selection along with low quality of food does not make me a happy person or a satisfied customer. I was tempted to ask for my money back but just took it as a lesson learned. Never again!   If you want a good deal I recommend hitting up one of the many other all you can eat places as you get more options for about the same price."}
{"text":"This place is disgraceful.  Everything came out of a can. Nothing was fresh. Lettuce was soggy, croutons were extremely stale (even for croutons) , eggs for the salads were watery and the potato soup was so bad I didn't even want to try any others.   We tried to speak to a manager and the shift lead working tonight (Sat Aug 2nd) came out and didnt even identify herself as the shift lead until we asked who she was. She had the gall to tell us that she couldn't refund our money because we had taken a few bites from our plates and that she'd get fired and there was no manager there. The shift lead also told us that they \"weren't as good as Golden Corral.\" Are you serious?? That place is nasty too. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Ok food, reasonable service. I feel like it's a little overpriced for the quality, but not horribly so, FYI, for those checking out the architecture, it has had many occupants over the years, even a bank."}
{"text":"Just went for the first my first time because my wife wanted to go. I really didn't want to because.. well it's a salad buffet. But I went in with an open mind to give it a chance and it was amazing and delicious.  Made myself a salad, a taco, nachos and a strawberry shortcake dessert.  Usually at buffets you fill up plates and there's always one or two things that just aren't good or you don't like. Not here! Everything was delicious and fresh. Every plate was scraped clean. The service was exceptional.  The only thing was the ice cream machine was broken but you could see they were trying their hardest to fix it. It was no big deal to me. I would definitely recommend it to anyone because if my thoughts on a place can go from not wanting to go to loved it. It has to be doing something right."}
{"text":"I rated this a 3 because it was fine, but we probably wouldn't return. It was a convenient lunch (stopping in before grocery shopping) and since it's a buffet, it's a great place to come with kids. I was disappointed by the options for salad- lacking protein options other than pepperoni and Chickpeas, and the veggie toppings could have been chopped up better to make salad eating easier. I also wished we could use a bowl rather than a plate."}
{"text":"No comparison to Sweet Tomatoes. The salads were just basic ingredients nothing fancy.  Then potato was old. Breads were stale.  Just Souper disappointment. Wasted time and left loosing my appetite"}
{"text":"I am writing this update just as a follow-on to my recent review of Sweet Tomatoes.  We went to SouperSalad! yesterday for lunch.  Compared to Sweet Tomatoes, the salad material was better, the dressings were thicker and richer, and their tuna noodle salad had lots of tuna in it.  They also had Thai peanut noodle salad and that was very flavorful and good!!  Only thing was that their soups yesterday were mediocre at best.  But being cheaper than Sweet Tomatoes, I think they are a better deal and I enjoyed their food a lot more!"}
{"text":"I like me a good salad.  I like me a good salad that I've constructed.  I like me a good salad bar.  Souper Salad's not bad, but this location definitely has some room roe improvement.  My co-workers and I make sure to show up as early as possible because we've learned that the later in the day you go, the more wilted everything is, especially the lettuce.  Sometimes, they forget to refill the items and it's invariably that one thing you NEED to make your salad perfect.  They do have a pretty good selection of toppings and a lot of health conscious dressings.  Their soups are bad.  I've tried a bunch hoping that one would be good because, hey, who doesn't like a good soup?  I've never once ate more than a couple of bites.  They're either too watery or too thick and never really taste like the kind of soup they're supposed to be.  The baked potato bar kicks butt.  But that's because messing up a baked potato isn't easy."}
{"text":"I love souper salad and I always love how this location is in the old bank building. I just wish that the staff was friendlier and that they would update the place to get with the times. They seriously have the same dishes as the day they opened....I mean come on! But the salad items are fresh and the hot selections are plentiful. Can't go wrong with a simple soup n salad lunch!"}
{"text":"I am an easy five star but I cannot deny SouperSalad the honor. Service was good tonight, the food is always fresh and yummy. The cornbread rocks and brownies too! Not to harsh on the wallet either, especially with the coupons as others have mentioned. Try it if you haven't!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quick meal or somewhere to eat and visit this is a good choice.  The atmosphere is relaxed, food is good and you are not rushed.  Come on by, it's  got something for everyone"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, massive salad bar and their vegetable beef soup is fantastic with a shot of sriracha \"rooster\" hot sauce."}
{"text":"I am shocked at how scary this place was! I had not ever been to this location, but needed a quick place to stop for food. We always like eating at the PV mall location, until it shut down. The complaint list is long; starting with food items that should be cold were actually warm, and the warm items were cold. The bins of food had other food items in them, for instance the sour cream, cheese, and butter were all almost empty but had lots of other gross items mixed in them as if they have been sitting there for hours. The ranch dressing was almost gone and some other dressings looked like they hadnt been stirred for a long time. There was food all over the counters, and the only time I saw a counter being wiped was when an employee leaned over the open containers of soup to yell at the top of her lungs back to the kitchen. The potatoes were cold and so was the macaroni and cheese. The pizza looked like a microwave pizza, undercooked and hard from sitting out for god only knows how long. We walked over to get soft serve ice cream and the area looked like a bomb had gone off, there was food everywhere! On a good note, the service was good, our server checked on us frequently and was very nice. But the unsanitary presentation of buffet style dining has my stomach churning too much to go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Souplantation/Sweet Tomatoes and was disappointed with the salad bar variety at Souper Salad (only about half the selection of Sweet Tomatoes). Also, several items had run out and were not refilled. Perhaps it wasn't the best idea to go at 3pm, when the restaurant was pretty much empty. But still! I would expect the items to be fresh and stocked.  I gave it an extra star for the value, since I did use a buy-one-get-one-free coupon! I would go back, but only when there are more people next time."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I enjoy going here. Cheap and always decent food. The only thing it needs is to change up the selection once in a while."}
{"text":"Plenty of options for everyone.  Great service. This is our go to place when nobody wants to cook"}
{"text":"Souper Salad is legit !  Especially, when you score their coupons.  As a matter of fact, I am about to redeem mine this week.    $4.44 for an all you can eat salad, soup and other delicious items that they have ?    Oh yeah, suck on that Sweet Tomatoes !  To score their coupons all you have to do is sign up for their emails from their website.  They send out coupons consistently but this one $4.44 is by far the best one since I signed up.  Look, this location anyway, might not be the best looking but once inside you have unlimited salads, soups, pasta salad ( small selection ) bake potatoes, ice cream, pizza etc.  Regular price I believe is $6.99 and an beverage is $1.99 save your money and just drink water !  Sweet Tomatoes is expensive I believe $8.99 plus the price of your drink and they are no different than Souper Sald.  They seem like they have a larger buffett but they don't because both sides of the buffets have the same offerings.  Its designed to move you along quicker because they certainly are not offering you more.  Souper Salad is as good as it gets !  They are at least $2 cheaper and when you multiply that by a family of four ?  That's an $8 savings !"}
{"text":"I'm not terribly keen on buffets, never have been. My gf is though, so we often come here. I like it. The price is  tolerable, the food is decent. I generally get a baked potato.   I do want to say though that the service is excellent. They provide great hospitality and do not hover. They do their job, do it well."}
{"text":"Ok, its a buffet style soup and salad place, so if you were expecting the words \"delicious\", \"amazing\", or \"gourmet\", than I'm sorry, lil' fella, cause this isnt that kinda joint! Ok, maybe amazing... you know whats amazing, two people eating in a public restaurant, in Las Vegas, until they are FULL, for under 30.00  dollars!! Yeah, in Vegas, baby!   Given, the soup tasted like college, you know, pretty much pure sodium, served fresh out of the microwave? But I like that, call me crazy. The salad bar was decent, no complaints from me here, nothing \"big-ups\" either, though. The server/hostess was nice, and the bathroom was REALLY clean. I give it for stars, for value, surprise factor, and friendliness...  Cheers!   dRe'"}
{"text":"Edited 10/16/16: Sadly, more changes and not for the better. Despite the perky cashier's exclamations of \"Awesome!\" the salad was anything but. Items I used to enjoy now have little to no flavor, and not just this visit. I've been hoping it would get better but it isn't happening. Loaded potato salad, tuna skroodle pasta salad, and--inexplicably--the ranch dressing now have zero flavor. What are they doing to cause one thing after another to become so bland?   Two years ago I gave up on their minestrone soup which I also used to enjoy, and then noticed it started to have a very odd flavor and seemed watered down..Other soups I normally like I did not care for either, so I finally gave up on soups and ordered salads only.  The desserts/sides were fine.  The lettuce and vegetables are still fresh and there is usually a good variety, but given the blandness of the salad I got tonight I will not be going out of my way to stop there again anytime soon.   Downgrading from \"OK\" to \"Meh.\" Maybe I'll try again in a couple of years."}
{"text":"If you like school cafeteria food:  I wanted to like it, I really did.   I LOVE Sweet Tomatoes and was hoping Souper Salad would be just as good.  I was very disappointed.  The pasta from the salad bar was greasy.  The mac and cheese tasted horrible I couldn't even swallow it.  And the cheese sause for the nacho bar was disgusting..it had a weird consistency to it.  I ended up mostly eating sunflower seeds and fruit.  The only thing I really enjoyed were the Gingerbread muffins.  They were delicious!  I'm giving two stars because of the muffins and because we did have great service.  My husband lost the coupons we had gotten and the cashier still gave us a discount.  When I asked if they had brown sugar, they went to the kitchen to see if one of the cooks could spare some.  And our server was very attentive and friendly.  But personally, I would rather spend $2 more and eat at Sweet Tomatoes!"}
{"text":"I understand it's hard to run a cheaper buffet efficiently while maintaining a high sanitary level. However, I was definitely let down by this location. We went on a Sunday afternoon and almost all the tables were covered in dirty dishes and food was pressed into the floors. The utensils were falling into other dishes and some of the options weren't fully stocked. The service was very quick with out table in clearing empty plates and extremely cordial. Maybe they just need more staff for a Sunday after church lets out?"}
{"text":"This location is much closer to my house than Sweet Tomatoes and I appreciate having a healthy buffet nearby. This place is VEGAN friendly but salad places should be. The stand-outs for me: a broccoli, raisin dish similar to coleslaw (normally I hate these dishes but I truly enjoyed this one); the black bean soup; the vegetable soup had a very strange, unappealing after taste; the vegan cornbread could have used a bit more flavor or sweetness. Also, I believe they have a slight discount on Tuesdays?"}
{"text":"First time ever eating at a salad buffet like this. Used to having more meat than salad. This place had alot of veggies to top of your salad, along with the variety of salad dressings. Soups were also available, I do recommend the vegetable soup. That was by far the best thing on their menu for me. There were also build your own tacos. I didn't enjoy that at all, meat was too soft like almost to a puree type texture. Salad was good I did enjoy alot. After my first time here, pretty descent ill come back again ...."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Phoenix area so this is my first experience with a Souper Salad Restaurant, I went today thinking of it as a restaurant similar to Sweet tomatoes.  Let me start with the fact that I was surprised that it was pretty cheap, I paid around $6.50 per person (later on I understood why it was so cheap). When we got there it looked that they were understaffed, only 3 guys completely running the restaurant (waiter, cashier and cook). That being said, our dirty plates weren't removed the whole time that we were dining.  To be honest I was surprised to see taco meat and nachos. The taco meat was more like mystery meat, it looked old and dry. The nacho cheese was more like 80% water, 20% cheese.   In conclusion, this restaurant makes my High School cafeteria look like a fancy steakhouse in New York. It has a rundown appearance and most of food wasn't fresh. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"They have completely remodeled this location and it's much nicer than it used to be. We spoke to the owner and they are really working hard to improve the place. This was a great meal and the place was spotless. Everything we had was fresh and tasted spot on. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It's a $7 buffet so what are we expecting here, people!?  I think for the price, it's a decent meal.  There is every type of lettuce, topping and dressing you could hope for on a salad.  And I loooove a big, juicy salad!  In addition to the greens, you can find pizza, garlic bread (which is actually really good), baked potatoes which you can top with bacon, cheese, sour cream, etc.  There are 4 soups to choose from, a mini taco bar, and basic desserts (pudding, angel food cake with strawberries, ice cream stand).  There are also several pasta salads.  Everything is replaced ASAP.  Could it be better quality with more choices?  Absolutely.  However, I like the fact that it's cheap and there is enough variety for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"It's cool that they have this concepts and all the veggies and food, but it's not really a clean place. The tables and the whole place was not how a restaurant supposed to be. I may go back there but I will not eat there."}
{"text":"Have eaten there many times and always had a good experience.  Unfortunately, I went there last week for lunch and the place is closed, out of business. I understand they have a store on the east side of town that is still open, but since I don't work on that side of town, it doesn't do me much good.  I'm going to miss it."}
{"text":"I ate at this location yesterday and developed food poisoning. The salad wasn't tasting all that good, so I tried other food there. I ended up eating some of the tacos and I believe it was the tacos that got me sick. The symptoms I developed were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills and sweats. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I eat here because it's cheap and healthy.  Like people say it is soup and salad bar, nothing more.  The soups are usually pretty good and probably the best stuff there but they only have 4 to choose from.  Sweet tomatoes across the way is hands down better with different themes that change every few weeks but it is a few bucks more.  I do eat souper more often though not just because it's cheaper but I eat here when I just want salad and some soup.  I usually leave sweet tomatoes stuffed because I ate all the pizza, muffins, pasta, and deserts.  I will say I always get great friendly service at souper salad, probably because it's always empty."}
{"text":"I had a great experience eating here this weekend the service was great & friendly the restaurant was clean & the food was really good. I had the salad with fruit in it with noddles ,potato salad small sliced pizza and a ice tea. The desert was really yummy I had a brownie with custard and pudding. I plan on going there at least once a month when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Yes, this can be accurately described as a less refined Sweet Tomatoes; but the food, in my opinion, is quite delicious nonetheless.  The salad bar is well stocked with a good variety of fresh veggies, toppings, and some tasty prepared offerings.  I tried a few of their soups and they were all flavorful and had substance.  My favorites were the pasta fagioli and vegetable soups.  They also offer a selection of breads, nacho/taco fixings, baked potatoes, and some pasta but I didn't try any.  The shortcake paired with strawberry topping was a fabulous dessert.  The shortcake was moist and had a pretty light texture.  Another plus...Fresca is a soda fountain option!  Service was great.  There were two servers who were taking care of the entire restaurant and they were way on top of clearing our dishes and both were super nice.  The one downside is that the restaurant is kind of rundown looking inside and could use a little revamping."}
{"text":"Nothing really outstanding here.......most everything was bland and boring!!  Salad is salad.....the one soup I had was good, but the muffins, apple crisp, etc was dry and stale.  I've been here a few times and I always leave thinking \"Why did I go here?\"."}
{"text":"Not bad. The cashier was nice. Quick with our order. The place was clean and we'll stocked with food. We had several items that tasted very fresh. I did not care much for the mushroom soup. It was a little rich for my taste. The baked potatoes were good with all of the toppings they offer. People came by often and picked up or plates.  I remember there being more items , when I was younger, but it was still good. Or maybe I'm thinking of sweet tomatoes."}
{"text":"Not the best salad place.  Lettuce was wilted and not a great selection of soups.  Uninspired food but staff was friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Came in today, Buffett was clean but no one came to the table to take our plates until about 30 seconds before we left, they ran out of spinach. Had to ask for it, same with pizza. See staff just standing around...plus the ice cream machine froze up and wouldn't work...lost 1 star. Like this place because it's close to where I live and pretty inexpensive but in general they need to step up their game...it's only a Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.   I went to go get my haircut in Town and Country over near the Biltmore and had some time before my barber showed up  and decided to get a bite to eat, so I wandered into Souper Salad to give it a try.  I ordered the buffet and some Ice tea. It was really terrible, the salad selections were lame, and look not so fresh, the glass didn't look clean nor did the dishes or silver ware.  My table was dirty my server Nico did not reach his server goals, I did not have my drink in 90 seconds or less.   The Baja tacos looked old an not at all fresh...definitely did not feel like I was on the beach as the sign said on the wall after sampling one.    Everything was bland except for the soup, and the pasta was OK and that is the only reason this place got more then one star. In general thought they needed to just rename this place to Soup...no salad!!!!"}
{"text":"No. Just stop and move onto another restaurant. If you're looking for unlimited soup and salad, hit up sweet tomatoes. Or even Olive Garden.  At least you know it will be fresh.  Maybe we came at the wrong time, but they were completely out of a few things, and it was obvious that other things had been sitting for far too long. I tried to eat everything that looked somewhat appetizing,but could only stomach the basic salad and a little bit of soup. The rest of the food items were just gross.  Might be slightly healthier than the typical greasy Chinese buffet, but if healthy is a concern at a buffet, spend another dollar or two and find another restaurant.  On top of everything else, the carpet looks like it is 40 years old and might have never been cleaned. There is trash and food all over it.  Would have given zero stars, but the mediocre ice cream included with the meal is worth one half star. Round up to one star."}
{"text":"Souper salad is just OK....  Sweet Tomatoes is waay, waay better!  I don't mind forking out a few more dollars at Sweet Tomatoes because it is higher quality & a better selection, and everything just seems fresher than at Souper Salad.  I am highly disappointed at the frozen yogurt at Souper Salad...It is that low-quality ice milk garbage! Sweet tomatoes is creamy & delicious!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't fresh, service was terrible, everything was dirty and gross. This place is worse every time we come in, used to love coming in here. $24 for salads and water is pretty steep too, I think we're done here."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying this is no Sweet tomatoes...but the establishment was clean...the service was good..and the food was decent. Now that is the good news...here is why i only gave Souper Salad only 3 stars...first of all they had only 4 choices for soup when you get at least 8 at Sweet tomatoes. Secondly there was not enough servings of anything they had...but what they did have was good...i don't want to discount that fact. I also had a problem with the fact that they had soft serve but no brownies...and all buffets i have been to at least have that.  Now understand i know that sounds petty but i just want my readers and fellow yelpers to know all the facts when it comes to this establishment vs other places like it i.e. Sweet tomatoes. The layout of the dining room is very nice and spacious and when we went for an early dinner this evening it was fairly quiet. The mac and cheese was really good...but there was no really good bread to eat with it though. My wife enjoyed the taco's which had all the fixings...and all the vegetables were fresh.  The pizza wasn't great...the pasta could have been better...and the fact that you couldn't refill your own drinks (like at Sweet Tomatoes) was also a huge problem for me. Now the price i have to admit was unmatched...i would go to this establishment again for that reason alone. My wife and i only paid 13.29 for the both of us to enjoy the buffet...just wish there had been more choices but for the money it was not terrible. So if you are looking to eat healthy and are looking for a cheaper alternative to Sweet Tomatoes...then this is your locale. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"You are quite the LIER MR. And there are several people whom ALSO placed poor ratings on your location for your treatment to them.  I hope your business closed due to your DISCUSTING lies and attitude and I wish you no good luck.  You don't deserve it.  None of our friends or family will ever eat at your filthy resteraunt.  Maybe check the news on how AWFUL your ratings are."}
{"text":"It is part of a chain, in a rundown mall, in a retro building from a 60's sci-fi movie.  But, the food is worth the trip back to bad architecture land. Salads are salads and soup is soup but the variety and the freshness of the ingredients make this place stand out.  The Mexican cheddar soup was fantastic, just the right amount of kick to let you know that you are in Arizona not Kansas.   If you get too overcome by healthy there is plenty of bad stuff available: ice cream, pizza and sugary delights.  Don't let the idea of going to a chain soup & salad place stop you from enjoying this place.  And enjoy the retro-building and try to guess what it was in its glory days."}
{"text":"We both were in the mood for something different today, and so we came here today. Everything was nice and clean. Everything was fresh. We came during dinner hours and was pretty quiet. Will be back."}
{"text":"I have been a patron here for years.  Souper Salad is my go to buffet when I want to stuff my face without the guilt.  Yes, I know I'm delusional.   Any who, the salads and all the fixins are fresh. They usually have one premade salad de jour.  I don't usually go for the premade salads so try at your own risk.     The cold pastas haven't changed much over the years.  I can say that the  tuna and fettuccine pastas are pretty tasty.   They have other pastas and potatoe salads that I have not tried.    The soup bar is hit or miss.  Some days they have several delicious soups other days the options are blah.    Next comes the baked potatoe and sweet potatoe options.  Several toppings are available for you to pile as high as you like.  I go for the classic baked potato with chili, cheese, green union and a large dallop of sour cream.  Mmm.  Slide on down to the bread section.  Warm chocolate muffins, blueberry muffins and savory cornbread are available with butter.  Also available are several thin crust pizzas.  Veggie, cheese and pepperoni are your options. The pizza options are not all out at once so keep an eye out for the pizza you want.     We've come to the end of the food buffet.  They used to rotate the food options frequently in this area.  Lately i have noticed that the nachos have taken permanent  residence in this space.  I wish I had something nice to say about the nacho \"cheese\" but no.  It's lumpy, watery and flavorless.  Desserts available are soft serve ice cream (vanilla flavor only), toppings, seasonal fruit and strawberry shortcake.  Now for the REALLY exciting part about this place... It's an architectural blast from the past!  Yes folks, a mid-century gem!!!  One of very few mid-century buildings left in Phoenix.  Geek out and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to report that the food here was fresh, abundant and varied. Often times with buffets  you never know what you're going to walk in to. But I was pleasantly surprised and happy with the offerings.  For about $16, my dad and I enjoyed the buffet and two drinks. We chowed down on salad, soup, pizza, tacos and dessert. Well not ALL of that, but those are the options available.   What really makes this location special is Barbie. She walks around clearing plates and offering refills on soda and coffee. She is truly a sweet heart. Extemely friendly and outgoing. I would drive all the way to this location just to experience her kindness. She works on Tuesdays, FYI!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy option for lunch or dinner, this is the place to go. There's almost too many topping choices for your salad that you create yourself buffet style. All you can eat for around 8 bucks will save you money but may break your calorie count. Overall its a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Eeew. Just eeew! If you want some kind of soup and salad buffet, check out Sweet Tomatoes just across the street."}
{"text":"Not a Sweet Tomatoes that's for sure. The selections are scarce and when you are use to all they have to offer at the Sweet Tomatoes, you are definitely disappointed when you see what they have to offer at this Souper Salad. In a pinch it would work, but you can definitely find something else better."}
{"text":"My family comes comes here often, usually a couple times a month. We came tonight for dinner and never had I been so disappointed. I don't by all means expect fine dining here. I do however expect cleanliness. Had an inspector come in on this particular night I'm certain they would have failed. Starting with the salad bar, dressings were dripped everywhere. Now I realize this happens and they are usually out there wiping it down often because of that. What I'm upset about is the fact that it was half dried on drips and half not. We're talking hours of drips, we were here an hour, not once was it wiped down and yet a girl with long brown hair took the time to wipe down all the glass on the entire bar where food doesn't even touch.. I mean come on. Moving on to the soups, tacos, potatoes and nachos. Once again the counter was a disaster! Dried on and not. Absolutely no care was taken to assure that it was a clean space. Tables empty for as long as we were here continued to be covered in mess for way longer than they should have been with only one man (dark hair with facial hair) bussing them. Including ours which was towered with things and not once did anyone ask to clear it until we were almost done with our family of 5 Crowded with dishes.  At one point in time three workers (long haired girl, dark haired facial haired man, and dark short haired girl) congregated by the front window, chatting, looking out at lights, I'm not sure what they were doing but one girl (dark short haired girl) even took her phone out to take pictures. Some serious training needs to happen or at least having a responsible person here to keep everyone on task. This trip really has me second guessing coming back. What a waste of the remodel if you aren't going to take proper care of the place and your customers. We paid almost $40 to Come here and I was annoyed the whole time."}
{"text":"For a family of 5 we ate fairly cheap. Was about $35 for all of us. We are first timers, and we're ok with our kids having a soup & salad buffet! Employees were very friendly, and food never sat empty. They were constantly refilling and removing plates. The food was mediocre. I seen the review from earlier today so I made sure to ask if they had fresh cucumbers. Cucumbers at 7pm were good."}
{"text":"This place was very good for the excellent price.  I especially loved the beef noodle soup which had a dark rich broth and lots of noodles and meat. I was in a soup mood on this chilly evening and I had three small bowls of it.  The chicken with star noodles was also good.  I had two bowls of it.  I only had a taste of the potato-leek and was too full to appreciate it.    The salads were fresh and tasty but I was running out of room so I couldn't finish them.  There was only one piece of pizza left, which I ate.  It had good flavor, though was more like frozen pizza than pizza parlor type. The Caesar salad was gone when we first went thru so I didn't taste it.  My daughter went back for some and liked it.   She said the ice cream was real good at the end.  I only had room for a tiny piece of sweet honeydew melon and small portion of strawberries, both good.    The dinner was $5.79 for me and $6.79 for her and we both felt like it was a bargain.  While it was buffet, the girl walking around kept checking with all the customers see if they needed anything.    There wasn't anybody at the cash register when we walked in even tho we waited a couple of minutes so we went ahead and went thru the line.  I'm sure we could have left without paying as nobody seemed to realize we hadn't paid, except that's not my style, so we tracked somebody down to pay when we were finished.   They had already closed out the cash registers since it was closing time and couldn't take my credit card so I paid cash and received a handwritten receipt.  But the manager and helper we chatted with at the end were so nice it balanced off the negative.  Oh, and I especially looked carefully at the trays and dishes after reading an earlier review but everything was very clean.  So was the table we sat at, though we did change tables as the first booth we sat at was very small and left us no \"growing room.\"  The other booth was spacious and fine.  Next time I'm in a soup mood, this is my place to go!"}
{"text":"So I finally had a meal in the funny looking building.  I quite often get coupons for this place and decided to check them out.  Got there right at opening (10:45).  Everything was out and ready.  Everything was neat and fresh.  One of the soups out was not on the online menu and the mushroom soup was missing.  The front end manager noticed my hesitancy in choosing a soup and made a comment and I told him I was looking for the mushroom soup and he said somebody forgot to order the heavy cream called for and the back end manager was out scouring stores looking for enough.  So I tried a pretty good vegetable beef..  Of course I built a big salad and also had a cold noodle salad and some potato salad and some corn bread.  The only thing I really did not care for was the pizza, but then again this isn't a pizza place.  About 1/2 way through my meal the manager brought over a bowl of mushroom soup from the back, still without the cream but quite tasty.  While this place should be a 3, that attention to customer service in a buffet got them a 4th star.  Everybody I came in contact with was pleasant.  Overall I think I prefer the salad bar at Sizzler because it does a better job of the hot area while being about equal on the salad part of it and they are just down the street from my shop.  But I just might make the drive again with another coupon."}
{"text":"Free soda with Yelp check in!  I love salad bars so this is my kind of place.  They dont just have salad, they have 5 or 6 kinds of soup, pizza, pasta, ice cream.  Even though there were a ton of choices to eat, I was all about the salad bar.  It had a little bit of everything.  The restaurant is big and there was plenty of seating and they were busy too.  We went right around lunch time so maybe they slow down in the afternoon."}
{"text":"You really can't go wrong here. The food itself isn't so outstanding, but the buffet style makes up for it. I always eat too much, but I don't feel TOO guilty, since it's mostly veggies I'm eating. The pizzas are alright as well, and who can resist pizza with a side of ranch for dipping? I also am a great fan of soft serve, so the ice cream bar is a nice touch.  It's a great place for families, and especially families with kids, as there's a lot of options to satisfy picky eaters and adventurous gourmands alike."}
{"text":"Don't confuse \"souper\" with \"super\". Nothing special, its 2:00 and they are out of a lot of stuff. low quality food."}
{"text":"This place is perfect if your looking for a lite lunch.   I went here because I wanted something new. It was fairly cheap I think it was about $6 bucks a person with drinks and tip it was about $20 total.   Food is good not great but good   They have a variety of different salads and toppings such as eggs, bacon sunflower seeds etc...Variety of soups creamy cheese broccoli, veggie soup and a chicken noodle.They also had pizza and tacos, and they have a dessert bar.   This place is nothing to run home to momma and brag about but its good cheap and fast..."}
{"text":"The food is good. This place remind's me of Cici's Pizza. Except it's healthier. It's a soup & salad buffet! But they've also got pizza, pasta, pies, baked potato (regular and sweet), and ice cream. It's a great place to go for a casual lunch with a group of people if you want somewhat healthy for a super price. Can't go wrong with this place, you get to choose whatever you want and however much you want to eat!"}
{"text":"Food - ok. If you are looking to just build your own salad. One premixed option. Watery mac n cheese. Cheep tacobell tacos. The flavor is ok. The soup is not hot, like it should be. Ambient- the place would be nice, if they would clean up more frequently. Casual. Modern. Service- nonexistent. They take your money and off you go. They will occasionally come buy to pick up your plates. Asked one of the waiters there if they could reheat my soup because it eas cold. She said \"I'm sorry, but we have no where to do that. We only have stoves.\" Price- 6.99 adult... + drink. I don't feel I got what I paid for."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and after reading the reviews we were so excited to go! After walking in...we should've walked right back out! The staff was fine but the patrons looked at my daughter and I like we were two drug addicts trying to rob the place. The average age in there was 60+ and they stared as if they had never seen two beautiful Puerto Rican ladies before! The food was pretty good although the same toppings are not on both sides of the bar. Red bean and rice soup with sausage was really yummy but the atmosphere was so bad that we couldn't wait to get out of there! A lady actually told my daughter to move because she needed a soup bowl...have you we were in a line of people and we where already serving our soups so 5 seconds is all she had to wait with her mouth shut! Incredible! My daughter has never told me that she feels out of place before but in the parking lot she asked me to never bring her back. So sadly all the nasty stares and dirty looks worked we'll never go back so all the good ole boys/girls don't have to worry! The old and rude people win! Everyone got a kill you with kindness smile out of me and its just sad that the people in that establishment are actually okay with their behavior...for a 14 year old to vocalize it speaks extremely loud volumes to me!"}
{"text":"I'm either having major dejavu or I have already written a review for this SouperSalad. I live nearby and frequently shop at the Target, Fry's, or Ross in the same shopping center.  Forget about your silly \"my food can't touch\" OCD and plop it all on the same plate. The salad bar is plentiful and the soup is warm and tasty. You can get pizza, bread, tacos, fried chicken, fruit and soft ice cream, to name just a few of the options. All you can eat plus a drink for under $10. Brian will take care of you. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I used the salad bar three times.  They have such a great variety of lettuce. Romaine, spinach, spinach with oil, kale, cabbage and more. The selection for toppings is tremendous!! Broccoli, boiled eggs, olives and SO much more. And soups!! Great place!!"}
{"text":"This establishment is everything you need! Ideal pricing for plentiful, well prepared food. Something in management must be right as it is always busy when I arrive. Sign of a good deal.  I recommend the pizza, if that suits you. The options should meet anyone's wants and desires. Plenty of healthy food options are available as well as some short order items (tacos, potato bar) and soft serve ice cream.  Smiling faces always greet you upon arrival, excellent service all around. Stop by their place!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot better than the competition down the street. I already gave a review.. Guess it doesn't show yet. This place is always a good experience. I eat here about 3 times a week. A lot better than fast food all around them"}
{"text":"Fabulous place and that guy Christopher is so nice and helpful i would recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's too bad that this restaurant has taken a step backward. Some of the old staff have gone and things aren't the same. Some food missing or in short supply. Ground beef is far to salty. Certainly not as busy as before also. Maybe there's a reason!!!"}
{"text":"The choices are very good. Unlike Sweet Tomatoes this place has meat. Salad fixings are always fresh. Good choices of soup. Fruit is very good  & fresh. Ice cream okay but nothing to brag about. All in all we like this place."}
{"text":"Sounds health conscious, and it probably is the smartest choice for a buffet.  It is still a buffet nonetheless.  Both times that I came here to eat I ended up with a mountain of junk on top of my lettuce by the end of the buffet line.    I noticed that the food isn't always replaced either, especially when they aren't crowded.  It is no secret that gluttony is the most American deadly sin, and you would think salad gluttony would take a bit of the guilt off, not so much.  I still left feeling bloated and ready for a nap after my meal.    If you want to do a buffet, do it right and quit kidding yourself with this soup and salad nonsense."}
{"text":"Stay as far away from this place as possible. I went here against my will, I am surprised that I am still alive. Family members suggested eating here  after going to the mall. Big HUGE mistake. I am not sure what was worse...the food or the employees. Both looked grossed as hell. I stuck to foods that temperature was not an issue...like pizza and bread. This place was filthy...everywhere, and the food was nasty looking."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I thought I already reviewed this. . .  Wait, what's this? Is this NOT the same as Sweet Tomatoes? Oh, my bad.   I'm not sure which came first so I'm not going to give bonus originality points to either side, but, frankly, neither place is too hot, in my book.   The same things apply to both: totally tasteless food in unlimited quantities. And, again, I'm not hating on the AYCE situation, but when you charge almost ten bones for it with no drink included give me some flavor!  I drop by from time to time when I realize I have eaten Taco Bell, J in the B, BK, or McD's in recent excess and need to force myself to consume some greens and/or non-fast food. It doesn't mean I enjoy it.   For those purposes, cool. Conversely, if you are just looking for a tasty salad, this isn't what you're looking for."}
{"text":"We ended up taking the family here on a Saturday. I was surprised to see that the location has been remodeled and it looks really great. The food was great as well the salad bar was clean and we had an enjoyable time. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"My experience here was really good as the staff was friendly and the food was great.  I can't believe the amount of food you get for the awesome price.  Although the building looks old school from the outside, the inside was very clean and nice.  The salad bars were clean and full of good looking and great tasting food.  I had a few salads loaded with veggies, a baked potato, and way too many bread sticks.  To top it all off I had a brownie... okay, maybe I had two brownies.  In short, this was a great meal at a great price.  I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and I will come back again soon."}
{"text":"Worried I'm the only one here. But the salad bar was clean, people nice and its soup & salad. Not bad for the $"}
{"text":"I love this place. First of all, the architecture is amazing. It was built in the early 1970s for a Savings & Loan by the noted architect Wenceslao Sarmiento, who designed a number of unique building around the Phoenix area.  The food is good, and unlike Sweet Tomatoes, this place regularly has a taco bar!"}
{"text":"Great! Exactly what we needed after a hot day @ the Phoenix Zoo. Fresh, cool, crisp salads! The salad bar was well stocked & clean. The soup options were perfect as were the desserts. It's a great price for what you get & the staff was very friendly & kept the dining area clean & in order."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place for many reasons 1 it's all you can eat and it's healthy food and 2 their ice cream area is heaven I really do enjoy coming here plus the staff is very kind."}
{"text":"Salads are fresh, tasty, appealong, plenty of dressings and varieties.  $12.50 per adult.  Price includes drinks, pasta, soups, baked potatoes, and bread.  Desserts are also included.  Servers very nice. Very healthy choices."}
{"text":"This is where I go when I'm hungry but want to keep the calories as low as possible. I wouldn't eat here on a normal basis. Keep in mind that it's a buffet environment so the food isn't going to have the best presentation.  The breads are not very fresh and they sit under a heat lamp until finished and the salads are in open bins so you never know if someone threw something back in or put their hands in it. However, for $7 you can eat all you want. They also have decent soups and just as much hot items as salad items. Not recommended but also not a horrible place."}
{"text":"Very good place to go for a quick healthy meal. Even though it is a salad buffet, they also have soups, breads, and on different days extra dishes like spaghetti or tacos. For about $8.00 you can get the buffet and a drink. The bar is always very clean and the staff is always friendly. They even have a \"Souper Fresh Club\" you can sign up for and get coupons and discounts via email, a $5.99 coupon is what i get the most. I would recommend anyone to Souper Salad."}
{"text":"Very poor management all the way around, staff rude, restaurant dirty, food not consistently supplied. If could give a 0 I would"}
{"text":"I'm going to write my review while I'm here so I remember everything.  First, was overcharged. They had to refund me and charge correctly. But he was nice so it was all good.  Salad: They need to take the time to actually cut the lettuce. It was in huge pieces. Not a huge selection of veggies. My salad dressing, which I thought was blue cheese was more like a ranch-like milk. Made my salad very bland.  Soups: nothing looked good so I skipped it Potato: it was ok. I mean how do you screw up a baked potato? You do have to backtrack and get your toppings from the taco bar (which I skipped too) Random Mac and cheese was cold. It might have been ok if it was warm.  My daughter's ice cream Sunday looked pretty icky too.  Overall, not impressed. And won't be back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the price and quality.  Considering the age of the restaurant, it's fairly clean and up to date with paint etc, however it could use a deep clean for sure.  This isn't a fancy modern salad shop, but at $8 something for all you can eat adult dinner...I don't care.  The lettuce was amazingly crisp, the baked potatoes were yummy, the bread sticks and muffins excellent and I enjoyed the thin crust pizza.  The soups looked great but in was full long before that and I never made it to the desserts lol.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The other day at gymnastics, the teacher asked all the kids about their favorite restaurants. Every kid said McDonalds - until mine.  They both answered Souper Salad.  It is a less fancy sweet tomatoes, and their soups are not nearly as good, but the price is unbeatable.  They have regular coupons and on Wednesdays, kids eat for $2.  The salad bar is pretty good and even has options that Sweet Tomatoes does not (like cottage cheese).  The salad bar is always clean and stocked. The staff is always polite, friendly and remove our dishes promptly.  The pizza runs out often but lately it has been replaced very timely (my daughter loves  their pizza). They also sometimes have steamed broccoli with cheese, which is great for getting kids to eat vegetables.   For dessert, they offer pound cake and strawberries for strawberry shortcake topped with soft serve ice cream.  For $6 (the average coupon price), you walk out of there very full, content and with happy kids."}
{"text":"Years before, it used to be good here. The quality has gone down quite a bit. The salads were really good; especially the thai noodle salad, the foccacia bread was excellent, and the blueberry muffins were scrumptious.  The most recent visit, there was a fish tacos promo (I think, by now, you know that I love fish tacos, right?)- in the windows, in the circulars, so we went out of curiosity. What a disappointment. Remember that old Wendy's commercial with that old lady asking \"Where's the beef?\"- yeah we were asking \"Where's the fish?\" It was like little tiny bits of fish- could've been the remainder of the last batch, I don't know.   Yeah, it's cheap, but not worth it. Would rather go to Sweet Tomatoes- even though it's way across town for us- it's like gourmet, and so many yummy options, compared to this one- it's sad, it used to be really good.   Honorable mention: the make your own strawberry shortcake dessert."}
{"text":"Gone downhill fast"}
{"text":"Oh wow!!!!! This is by far the dirtiest place I have ever walked into, months of food build up through out!  like I felt sick to my stomach as I'm eating thinking and looking at the disgust of filth. The owners are clearly burned out with this place or are just slobs them selves.  Either way NEVER AGAIN WILL I WALK IN.  I wonder how long the food sits and is reserved day after day    oh just ad salt lol....  Our state health inspector must be paid off or friends of the owner to even let it pass Inspections!!! doors need to be shut until they DEEP CLEAN  I can only imagine the kitchen!!!!!!  Ummmmm I just threw up in my mouth!"}
{"text":"I've come here for years with friends, on and off. Some restaurants are fancier ones that you would take a family or spouse to..........I use other restaurants for that purpose. This one is perfect to take a friend to just  talk, like a buddy you work with.   The food, served buffet style,  is healthy although some junk food options (Pizza, Tacos) are available to the side. Lots of salad variety with some protein additions, lots of pasta salads and dressings. I like most of the food here and the setting is pleasant. It's very inexpensive by today's standards and they don't rush you, I've been there talking for hours with friends and they don't mind.   Sometimes they're a bit short staffed but the staff are pleasant and do their job. This is a causal, working persons restaurant, not a special occasions one. For what it is, I think they do a great job.  The nearby large mall, long past it's prime and with lots of empty stores, does at least have a good multiplex movie theater with a separate entrance on the West side of the mall."}
{"text":"This is always a great place to take the kiddos for a healthy meal and ice cream for dessert. The location of this one makes it easy to find and the building looks like a giant onion."}
{"text":"Good variety of salads and pasta salads.  They also have soups, pizza, tacos, nachos, and mac and cheese.  The breads are yummy and there is soft serve ice cream.  The food is decent for the price and nice for a food sampler like me."}
{"text":"I was not happy when after i paid for my families meal to find not attended to buffet. The place sprung a major leak in the dinning area during the storm last night. The food, the nacho cheese was more water then cheese & the fruit had sat out far to long that it smelled & tasted funny.... Not to mention the salad was NO way fresh.  On the up side the customer service was great."}
{"text":"EW! it's a $6 buffet BUT so bland and boring.  I got a FREE Buffet for my birthday for signing up with the E-Club so despite past experience I went.  Yeah people will disagree and say its good for the money BUT  I don't like my food all dried out and cristy or saltless soup or a bunch of mixed salads I've never even heard of.  I ate some FRESH cheese biscuits a bowl of soup and then it was ice cream and strawberry shortcake for me.  If your broke its ok otherwise....."}
{"text":"This place is just like a hospital cafeteria. lots of boothes, very clean but It's an all-you-can EAT buffet. so What do you expect? Very BLAH!!  Really NO staff to speak of just a busboyAND SALAD BAR REFILL PEOPLE WHO WERE no WHERE TO BE FOUND.BUSBOY spent the entire time we were there flirting with other male patrons and NOT clearing tables. WE Had NO Expectations BUT it was still LOUSY NOT very many selections. 4 soups-butter bean,chicken noodle,beef noodle and beef vegetable(the beef was ground beef) 3 types of salad-chicken caesar-mixed greens and a blueberry mango special I tried. The beef soups were OK -filling anyways NOT much on the FLAVOR. There was pizza and potatoes and 6 different tuna & noodle-type salads and about 20 salad mix items for your salad BUT not anything EXTRAordinary. Pretty Awful Really NOT SO SOOUPAH!! Where to START?? If you need a quick fill and ONLY have $5 in your pocket-Give it a try-otherwise go try Chili's,Chop Stix or Romano's Macaroni Grill all in the same shopping center. For Value it is a good deal BUT for Quality NOT!! ONLY THING GOING HERE IS IT'S CHEAPER THAN A HAPPY MEAL @ $3.95 FOR LUNCH"}
{"text":"Visiting the area I was looking for a place ot have a soup and salad and stumbled upon this place which I am glad I did.  I was very surprised at the variety of salad toppings available.  It is a very expansive sald bar, as well as different options of soup.  I had the vegetable soup and it was delicious!  The veggies in the soup were hand cut and it tasted very very fresh.  I did see there were some not so healthy options and I did have a slice of the pizza, which was very good.  However, for the most part I opted for the healthy stuff, for which there was plenty to choose from.  Also the young lady that greeted us was very friendly and seeing we were new there, made it a point to ask us if we liked it when we were done.  Definitely a great value for healthier food options.  I loved this place!  I wish we had a place like this closer to my home."}
{"text":"If I could put 1/2 a star or less I would! My mom & I just walked out with nauseous feelings in our stomachs & the worst taste in our mouths! My salad was wilted & the dressing watered down beyond flavor. The soups looked & tasted to be at least a week old, and the bread the same. I tried putting crackers in my soup to help, but they were stale. And by that point I was scared to try much else. We were both very disappointed, especially having been mislead by the other reviews & this being our first time eating there. One thing I do know I will not be back! It's so not worth $9.00 to eat moldy lettuce & old soup!"}
{"text":"Souper Salad...Soup or Salad! Now I don't feel completely secure eating at a communal salad bar. You never know who has been there before you or how long the food has been out. That said sometimes you just have the hunger for a salad bar experience, and if that is true you can't beat the selection at Souper Salad. They have a huge salad bar, soup, pastas, fruit, baked potatoes, and desserts. It's all you can eat and everything tastes good enough! Next time you have a insatiable desire for a lot of salad souper salad is your place. Just don't expect five star food or service!"}
{"text":"If you want to go to a healthy buffet this will do but there isn't a lot of choices if you compare this place to their competitor Sweet Tomatoes. I came here with a friend who had a coupon...we are always on a look out for deals!   When you first walk in you go straight to the salad bar that has your choices of green salads, veggies, and pasta salads. Then if you want to mix things up there is a station with potatoes, sweet potatoes, pizza, soup, and my favorite garlic bread.   I had a plate of salad with a scoop of pasta salad. It was in a white cream sauce with corn kernels... tasted pretty decent. I went for two servings of their clam chowder because that was nice and creamy. I took about two sticks of garlic bread. (it's my kryptonite) It may look like it's hard but the bread is pretty tasty and it's soft."}
{"text":"$6.95 coupon. $1.99-$2.39 for a drink. We had a great salad. Also had taco baked potato and vegetable soup. Good deal."}
{"text":"I Went For The First The Yesterday And Really Enjoyed It. I'm A Vegetarian So Finding Some Thing On On the Menu Wast A Hard thing To Do. The Price Is Very Affordable And Inside Is Very Clean And Professional. It Is A Buffet But Thier Isn't A lot Of Options. But Every thing They Serve Is Amazing."}
{"text":"Friends were going to Souper Salad and asked if we would go with them.  We had not been there and assumed it was like Sweet Tomatoes and would be salad and very little protein.  Turns out they have more than salads. They have make your own tacos, small pieces of pepperoni pizza and baked potatoes and sweet potatoes you can fill with all manner of stuff.  It was not bad and we would go again."}
{"text":"Worst salad bar in the United States I've ever been to! We're new to the area and mistakenly assumed this place would be similar to Sweet Tomatoes. It's not. Not even close. I regret going there and I seriously regret not complaining to the manager and asking for our money back.   This place's salad bar is about 1/10th the size and selection of Sweet Tomatoes. And the salad \"quality,\" toppings and dressings cannot compare. Souper Salad offers nothing close to the Sweet Tomatoes full salad, soup, bread, etc. offerings - it's not in the same world in terms of food quality, selection or dining experience. Save your money and drive a little bit further to Sweet Tomatoes on S Power Road in Mesa. We'll never be back to Souper Salad and I suggest you avoid it!"}
{"text":"If you like buffets with ONLY Salad or Soup, some little entrees such as pizza or tacos, then for the price you can't go wrong with Souper Salad.  On a Sunday night we paid $5.99 per plate, $2 for a drink.  A decent variety, again if salad is your thing.  I was expecting a bit more of a selection when it came to the pasta plates tho. I believe years ago it did have more casseroles and potato salads.  Other than the ice cream machine being down, this is a decent place to stop and fill-up for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Souper Salad offers less salad choices than Sweet Tomatoes, but it does make up for it by adding a make your own taco bar and cheaper price than Sweet Tomatoes.  The quality is decent. In addition to the make your own salad station, there are a few premade salads, a few soups, pasta, garlic sticks, the aforementioned taco bar, sweet and regular potatoes, and cooked veggies (Spicy kernel corn when I was there). They also have muffins, brownies, and soft serve for desserts.   Service was great. My server was prompt in refilling drinks and taking away plates, and was very friendly.  Overall, I liked the convenience of the buffet, especially if you have limited time for lunch. I'd definitely eat here again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant yesterday and paid two meals with drinks. When I arrived at the salad bar I was dismayed to find pasta smeared on the serving tray. I dug through the whole pile and didn't find a single clean one. I then looked at the plates and began to pick them up in every stack of plates and they were ALL greasy, had food on them and smudges of black oil of some kind on them. My hands were greasy just picking them up.  I called for the manager and demanded my money back immediately and requested that she have all the plates and trays washed. The help and manager started picking through looking for an occasional clean-ish plate. When I saw this happening I told the manager that I would call the health department if she didn't remove all the dishes immediately.  My concern though is that all the food dishes may have been contaminated in the same manner. If you got sick there let me know."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to favs- always good and always a great deal. I really enjoy the soups, breads, and little extras this place has. Great lunch location on the cheap!"}
{"text":"I just don't know what to think about Souper Salad.  Anyone who knows me knows that I'm not a salad guy.  You don't even have to know me - just read the reviews and you'll know that I've said it a few times (probably in the last couple days).  But I also dig the buffet from time to time, because it keeps the family happy.  So this one could go either way.  In this case, I'm going to have to give them an overall thumbs up, and it was actually more because of the salad than the other stuff on the bar, which shocked me a bit.  The model is more like your cafeteria than a standard restaurant - you pay as you come in, then you get to hit the bars (yes, plural).  First the salad.  I'm sure they do that intentionally, with the salad likely being the cheapest ingredients.  That way you fill up on that first.  But the selection there is probably the best and freshest, so it's not all bad.  We had three salad selections - a caesar, an apple walnut and something else (just a generic green salad, I guess).  I was going for the apple walnut, but the apples didn't look good and there weren't many walnuts.  So I did caesar instead.  Pretty solid choice.  Then you can pile on the toppings, and they have a good selection.  The only downside is that they aren't duplicated, so if you want everything, you have to go down both sides.  Same for dressings - you might want something on the other side of the bar.  That could use better planning.  After the salad bar, you get to the hot bar, where you may have the choice of tacos, pizza, potatoes, bread and of course soup.  I wasn't really impressed.  I did make a soft taco and tried the pizza.  The potatoes were a bit small, but that's okay.  Our youngest made nachos that looked decent.  But the salad still was the star of the meal.  Finally there was an ice cream station that did okay but the soft-serve just looked off, so I passed (and I was really full from the salad - a bit of a rarity).  I don't know that we'll be back, but I was surprised, and if I feel the craving for a salad, I'd hit it again.  As a bonus, the service was really friendly and kept glasses full and plates moving off the tables.  Always a bonus at a buffet."}
{"text":"After shopping at Cost Plus I was pretty hungry and this was right next door so I thought I would give it a try. It was 10 bucks with a drink since I did not have a coupon. Its a very small salad bar. Everything looked fresh enough but there was not the variety you get @ Sweet Tomatoes. They only had 3 kinds of soup plus chili. The baked breads were pretty empty and looked less than fresh. The highlight was the sponge cake and strawberries & whipped cream. I love strawberry shortcake! I dont think I will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for awhile and either this place has went downhill or my expectations are way higher. Let me first say it is a Sunday night so it is really dead, of course. The salad bar is just boring, you get an iceberg mix, wilted spinach, a pre-made soggy caesar, and a small bagged mixed greens. There are all the normal veggies, celery, peppers, carrots, you know. The soups were atrocious looking, I tried the lentil veggie and it tasted like a cleaner, blech! I had a baked potato which wasnot completely cooked right with some margarine and sour cream that looks like it was sitting out too long. The breads were hard and bland. Everything was just meh. The state of the place is pretty bad. The carpet is stained and ripped. The booth seats are all ripped, mine was so messed up that i was sitting about shoulder height to the table, the same height as my kids on the other side. The tables were not bussed promptly, Ours wasnt bussed the whole time we were there and I hate sitting with my old buffet dishes while eating my new one. The waitress and another cook went outside to smoke and everyone was looking around for them. A guy was spraying the sneeze guard with cleaner, that can't be good, the spray most likey got on the food, hence the cleaner tasting soup. It was just an uncomfortable experience, I felt ill after leaving."}
{"text":"Souper salad is alright. Lunch price with a drink is about $9. Clean enough. I think sweet tomatoes (just on the other side of I17) is hands down better though. You won't likely hate your visit or be overly impressed. It's hardly ever busy, the food is warm (or cold if need be, i.e. the salad) and tastes fine. I'd suggest going to sweet tomatoes for about the same price and more vairety and higher quality"}
{"text":"Before dining at SS, I thought that perhaps \"Souper\" was a play on the word \"super\" and I envisioned some bullet proof it's-a-bird-it's-a-plane-no-it's-super-salad salads.  The restaurant would surely offer some unique choices of salad and soups which I hadn't seen before.  The restaurant would surely have many different kinds of ingredients and maybe some gourmet items as well.    Not!  Totally disappointed.  Apparently the place I envisioned would need to be called Souper Douper Salad, because the choices at SS were regular everyday buffet items.  For such an extensive bar, you would think the cook could tie a cape on some of those plates and let 'em soar.    For me, they really needed a more pleasing presentation.  The pictures that other reviewers have uploaded look a lot better than what I remember seeing.  Perhaps I should try another spot - Metrocenter ain't the best place to find quality.  Also, I was turned off by the number of salad choices that were covered in too much dressing, but take that as a side note, 'cos I'm picky.   Anyway, I created my own salad and had a bowl of regular veggie soup.  Didn't bother to re-up for seconds.  Maybe I wasn't hungry enough.  I'll try again much much later."}
{"text":"3 strikes, you're out!  The food is pretty common for a salad buffet restaurant. The main concern I have is their loyalty program and the lack of training for the employees. Since I work in the area, this restaurant is easy to get in and out of for lunch. I decided to join the Souper Fresh Club, which allows you to earn points every time you eat. All three times I've been there, the employees are clueless on how the program works. There are signs all over the restaurant to join the club. Why put them up if you are not going to train your team members on how it works?  Sweet Tomatoes is just across the street. Go there."}
{"text":"Innovative...its salad that isn't healthy lol...but it's good for my wallet so...I'll be coming again"}
{"text":"For as long as I've been in the valley now, I've never bothered to stop into souper salad.  Why?  I don't know....but I finally did for lunch today.  I really love how this place is set up.  Salad buffett with lots of fresh options. Not the tired buffet of salad stuff that I've seen at other places.  Many options to choose from, along with drinks, desert, and awesome breadsticks!  I got the combo with a drink, breadsticks and salad to go.  The server at the counter was friendly and nice, and I really enjoyed my time here.  I will definately be back in the future!!"}
{"text":"I took my kids here for lunch yesterday and was very disappointed! The salad bar was good but everything else was not. The muffins were tiny and looked like they came straight out of a box. The blueberry bread looked so weird I didn't even want to try it. (Are they aware Sweet Tomatoes bakes AMAZING muffins fresh out of an oven during lunch everyday?) The baked potatoes had no butter, sour cream, cheese or bacon bits. We tried two soups, I had the minestrone which was decent, and both of my girls tried a lemon chicken soup (I can't remember the name). It was so bad they both had one spoonful and wouldn't have any more. The worst item was the chips and nacho cheese. It wasn't real cheese!!! It was lumpy and tasted weird. Some type of powdered mix maybe? I've NEVER seen \"cheese\" like that in my life and I have had nacho cheese from many places.   Lastly, there were almost no booths to sit in and the woman who was working the dining area was very aggressive and clearly trying to make some tip money. I'm a great tipper and tip in every situation that presents itself but all we had was water and two trips to the salad bar. There wasn't anything that we needed and she kept coming by our table asking if we needed anything. Once or twice would have been good customer service but she came by four times. I would not eat here again and based in this experience I wouldn't eat at any other Souper Salad. I used to work in Tempe and ate at the Sweet Tomatoes on Southern a lot and they were WAY better than this!"}
{"text":"Good price with coupon (even regular price is much better than the other salad place).  The place is kind of run down and the selection is pretty much the same every day."}
{"text":"We come from NH and when we get out this way we'll stop in at least once a week. The staff is very friendly and the food has been always fresh and very good. The restaurant is kind of dated but nice and clean. We just love this place !!!"}
{"text":"SouperSalad has become one of the best lunch choice options for me for a multitude of reasons outside of it being conveniently close to work.  Up at the counter you can grab a special vegan or gluten free menu to carry around with you as you build your salad or pour your soup. It seems pretty obvious with salad, but sometimes you don't know... especially when it comes to salad dressing or toppings.  I have eaten here a ton of times, but the new office trend is getting the salad to go. A HUGE container for just salad comes with two small containers for dressing and a bag for bread. $3.99. You WILL be full. If you want the whole chabang (salad, soup, and potatoes) it's $5.99.  Join the email club and they send you coupons all the time. It's great when a bunch of us from the office go.  We also ordered one of their fruit platters for a work party and it was awesome. For $13.99 we got a huge plate full of various fresh fruits, and they even included serving spoons!   They are generally friendly, but slow as death... so that is the reason I am docking a star."}
{"text":"definitely worth it when you get a $5 coupon via email or on your receipt.  not as good as sweet tomatoes but good. i like their tuna snickerdoodle salad which is always on the menu and the make your own strawberry shortcake bar!"}
{"text":"OMG.. this is the place that made me hate buffets :(   I ate here almost 3 years ago & I still remember what happened afterward very clearly.  That day my BF & I went to the BJ's that used to be in Matthews to check out the huge sales they were having, since the store was going to close down. After we left BJ's we decided to get some lunch & Souper Salad was nearby. I love soup & salads so it sounded like a great idea to me! And actually while we were here I thought the food wasn't that good, but it wasn't that bad either for the price. I got a plate of salad with different types of veggies & dill pickles? Weird, but who doesn't like pickles?! I put a lot of pickles on my salad. I also got a bowl of minestrone because I think that was the only vegetarian offering they had at the time. My BF had the exact same salad as me & a different bowl of soup. Everything seemed like it was going very well!  To be honest, the salad wasn't particularly memorable (dill pickles were yummy, though), but I really liked the minestrone so I got another bowl of it. BF ate his salad & whatever soup he had. We left Souper Salad around 2.  I had work later on in the day & was supposed to stay there till 10. Around 7, I noticed that my stomach started feeling a little weird but I figured I probably deserved it because I ate like a pig at lunch & tried not to let it bother me. By 9, my stomach pains had gotten much worse so I asked if I could leave work & it was no problem.  For the next couple of hours I just laid in bed & cancelled whatever plans I had made that night.. I will spare you the details of what happened the next few hours but I had never experienced anything like this that I could remember & haven't since then either. I had gotten food poisoning a couple of times in the past at other places, but this was on a whole new level. I knew it had to have been caused by the minestrone because my BF didn't eat that & he didn't get sick. I guess I deserved it for going back for seconds?  If I had not gotten sick, I probably would have given this place 2 or mayyybe even 3 stars.. but after what happened, unfortunately I cannot give it more than 1 star.  The lady who was working that day was really nice. That's pretty much the only good thing I can say about this place.. & that I probably lost a few pounds because I couldn't eat for the next couple of days.. wah :("}
{"text":"Oh @SouperSalad, for nearly $10, you can include a drink in the meal.  I enjoy the food, and the selection. I will probably return from time to time, because it's close, and it's a decent price for the kids, who can have water.  But really, I don't think the soda should be an additional cost."}
{"text":"Man, what a dump.  Should have went to the other side of the freeway and ate at Sweettomatoes.  I was lazy and deserve it. Floor dirty, tables dirty, plates and silverware dirty.  The only thing that was clean was the parking lot. Don't waste your time.  Food was horrible too.  I left.  The ice milk with nuts was ok."}
{"text":"My ten year old son loved it. Need I say more-it was more about quantity then quality.  Right next to Guitar Center  and Bonefish-either one I recommend- but don't stop for salad next door and expect much."}
{"text":"After a trip to Target, we were hungry so my daughter and I stopped in for some dinner here.  She loves salad bars since she can pick out what she likes and just eat that.  It was about 8pm on a week night so they were not busy.  We were greeted warmly and paid then went to the salad bar.  Things had not been restocked but that's ok, there was still plenty and it was good.  They had some different salad....an oriental noodle one that I liked, and of course soup and bread.  For dessert they had the soft serve ice cream that is so yummy and lots of toppings to go with it.    The place was clean and the staff was nice.  It's nothing outstanding but it was good and we were full.  And it was fairly inexpensive too."}
{"text":"I grew up going to a similar establishment in California called Souplantation, and Souper Salad is just as great. It's a bit rough around the edges but it does the job.  I try to stay away from buffets these days but I have no guilt about stopping in here and pigging out on salads and soup. There's not much they can do wrong given the fact that they provide everything you need to make salads your way. They provide different greens, dressings and toppings for your salad. They have some pastas and pizzas for a little carb if you want. I'm not gonna lie, there are some opportunities for some unhealthy options too. They have a baked potato bar where you can put mounts of cheese, butter, bacon, sour cream, and more in a huge potato/sweet potato. I have also seen them have the make your own taco bar where I have been guilty of putting mas amounts of ground beef into a taco shell with limited amounts of lettuce and tomatoes aka just cheese and beef. I'm so glad that they are so cheap because it gives people a healthier alternative to fast food. With the nation's epidemic of being overweight and obese (especially in the low income population) it is necessary to have healthy options that are affordable to everyone. Souper salad costs just as much as fast food, maybe even less in some cases! Just as others have said, this a great place to eat after a hike or workout, because then you don't feel like you've made your workout worthless with an unhealthy meal."}
{"text":"I am a Souper Salad fan.  If I'm going to go, I try to make it right when they open, that way I'll be one of the first to get my food.  I have a grubby hands complex about buffets and I figure, if I get there first, I won't have to worry about that, right?  First of all, their salad bar is fantastico.  We're talkin' great.  It's filled with everything you could possibly want on your salad and more, including a plethora of dressing choices.  They also have pasta salads, fruit salads, pudding, fruit and other little delights in this area of SS.  Next up are the hot items.  They have a different menu every day of the week, but some food items always stay the same, like their breadsticks and pizza.  But sometimes they'll add different pastas or some kind of taco bar.  They always have a couple soups too.  If you want dessert, they have a frozen ice cream machine with a few different candy toppings for you to put on top.  They also have all the fixin's to make a pretty damn good strawberry shortcake.  You do get a waiter- he or she will take your drink order and pick up any dirty plates, so you'll need to leave a little tip at the end of your meal.  I can't remember the price per person, but it's pretty cheap, but if you're the coupon-y sort, you can often find one in the Sunday paper to get a dollar or two off."}
{"text":"Neither"}
{"text":"I love salad bars. Love. LOVE.   But I can't eat here. And by that I don't mean that it isn't veg-friendly - it most def is - I mean that the quality of ingredients, salad, toppings, potato bar, made-from-powder soups are so low that I get scared. Fear is an appetite inhibitor.   I've hit this trough three times, and had gurgley tummy after each and every one. The ladies that work here are totally great - even acknowledge and remove and replace, say, the cukes, when I express concerns about their harboring of evil bacteriums and such (WOW they smelled weird last time I was here). But any effort on my part to save my and others' bellies from grossville feels like polishing the brass on the Titanic.   So I continue to harass Sweet Tomatoes via email, monthly, with the hopes that one day we'll actually have a decent Bar in Charlotte. Fingers crossed. I might start a petition. Let me know if you want to sign."}
{"text":"This place has been around a long time. Everything is ok and on par with what I have come to expect here. That is the problem, everything is just ok. There is strong competition in the area that delivers more. It is time for this place to step up if they plan on being competitive. Other buffets in the area just offer way more options."}
{"text":"I ate Saturday lunch here recently.  My basic take-away from this experience is that this place is decent for the price.  The service was attentive and efficient for a buffet, and the dining and buffet tables were clean.  I thought the vege's on the salad bar were fresh, and the vegetable-beef soup was tasty.  My sweet potato was a little soggy, but no big deal. Overall this is only a place to go for a simple green salad piled high with a side of soup; if you're hungry for anything else you're sure to be disappointed."}
{"text":"This location certainly draws a large lunch crowd.  I was there with my son yesterday at about 12:30 and the place was packed.  The staff seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with everything. For instance, there were about 6 plates...more than we needed.  I did see some setting to the side that had leftover food residue from the last guest sitting to the side...I'm not counting those.  Anyhow, behind my son and I was a group of 6, so we weren't all eating right away!  I have been to this location in the past and there were no napkins at all - they used papertowels from the bathroom.  You pulled off what you needed and went with it.  Yikes!  Where is management when you need them? Food quality was good.  Veggies were fresh, some of the quantities pretty skimpy.  I understand it was lunch time. It seemed there were 2 servers only, and they were hustling. More were certainly needed. Overall, it's a good place to go.  I do enjoy meeting a friend of mine here on an occaisional Sunday afternoon when it's much calmer...altho that's when we had the paper towels issue...but, service is friendly, food is pretty good. Oh...and yesterday, the best soup...Chicken Enchilada Soup...if it's there the day you go...you have to get this!"}
{"text":"We're Matthews residents and have been going to Souper Salad for the past 7 or 8 years.  It's always very busy there...a sign of a successful restaurant.  If your children aren't really \"into\" salad, there are plenty of other options....a taco bar, potato bar (with all the fixings), pizza station, etc.  They shouldn't have a hard time finding enough to eat.  Every time I've been there, it's always been clean, safely prepared, and well-staffed."}
{"text":"I don't go often, but sometimes I feel the Sirens' call to build my own salad whilst walking along a sneeze guard. This place has a good selection of fixin's for salads and the plates are a nice temp for them. Not always super-chilly, but usually not hot outta the dishwasher.  Of course, you can grab a soup or two and split open a nice baked potato to be topped with broccoli and cheese, or taco meat and cheese, or whatever you like. I lean towards the taco/salsa combos for the taters.  Place is clean, in a converted, architecturally interesting and storied building. The mall it sits outside of is another story altogether...   Price is right, especially if you use a coupon."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. My husband has had gastric bypass so hes has to be carful of what he puts in his stomach and we loves the options for us all.  All you can eat salads, pizza soups, chilies and I love their strawberries in my lemonade. Yum yum yummers in my tummers."}
{"text":"Visited this location last night after some geocaching in the area. It had been years since I had previously been to a Souper Salad so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I found a coupon online for $5.99 for an adult buffet (does not include drink and tax), that could be redeemed for up to four people. You can either print the coupon or show it to the cashier on your mobile phone. The woman at the front counter who greeted us was very friendly.   We started by grabbing a tray and a plate and began building our own salads. There was a wide variety of ingredients to choose from and also many different salad dressings. The salads were very tasty and were chomped them down and then eagerly got up to try more dishes. We tried a few different soups, pizza, tacos, baked potatoes, mac and cheese, bread sticks and  nachos. I tried the tomato bisque, which tasted like sweet tomato sauce. My boyfriend tried something with chicken in it which he liked. The pizza was ok as was the baked potato. The mac and cheese was watery and tasted very bland and the cheese on the nachos didn't even taste like cheese. The food was exactly what I expected when we payed for it. Not the best tasting but filling. I started dipping the bread sticks into the soup and it was tasty.  The woman who took our plates was very friendly to the customers. She interacted with everyone, cleared the tables quick, and even took some orders up front when they seemed to have a small dinner rush. She even told each customer who was leaving to have a great evening and thanked them for coming in. The customer service at this location is much higher quality than the food for sure."}
{"text":"I get made fun of at work for having brought a couple of my coworkers here in the past. I convinced them to go because I had a coupon and we'd all save a few bucks compared to Sweet Tomato. I've never gotten them to come back. Something about the lettuce looking wilted and the vinyl being cracked in the booths and the carpet being threadbare. Well - that was two years ago and they've updated the interior!  Personally, I think it's pretty awesome that you pay $5.55 with a coupon and get the same amount of food as ST. Now, the ambiance isn't quite as nice and the outside of the building is funky, but for salad, it's great. I get the takeout salad for $3.99. Yes, I said $3.99 which is $4.34 with tax!! You can't beat that! And, if you do it right, you can shove like 2 pounds of salad into that little bowl (you just have to squish the edges until the top pops on). They also give you a little baggie for fruit and such. It's great."}
{"text":"Nice little place that's been around for a long time. Make your own salad and lots of toppings to choose from. They have 3 to 4 soups to choose from as well. A nacho, taco, and potatoe bar at the end of the foodline. Lots of seating so it's good for groups."}
{"text":"This time, the pizza that my kid likes was put out so.slow.that.it.was.ridiculous!!!! They put one out and it was gone in a nano-second! Well, the crust is so damn thin it likely takes THREE MINUTES to cook another one!! There was simply NO excuse for not keeping the pizza filled up.  The soup that I loved last time wasn't the same. I noticed the employee kept putting fresh soup into the old soup. THAT is WRONG!!! Let the soup get down to a reasonable low level and then fill it up!!! Don't keep dumping fresh into old!!  I was disappointed this time compared to last time. I'll go back and hopefully it is right next time!!"}
{"text":"Again. Not a fancy place.  Pretty inexpensive and great for a quick soup n salad. Don't certain with uber expectation, but you do get more than just a soup and salad from a restaurant.   I have ate here several times over the last 5 years and have never got sick.  I guess those things happen, but I'm fortunate that I never got sick here.  Place was being cleaned regularly throughout lunch. Food was also replenished.  There are a variety of salads to choose from, a taco bar, potato bar, soft serve ice cream, pizza, bread sticks, corn bread. A seasonal bread, brownies, pudding, strawberries and whip topping. Not bad for the $5.99 special they had today. Lots of choices. Also offer reduced calorie dressings for salad. Also offer grilled chicken for $1.69 for those wanting that option."}
{"text":"ok, this is the second time I tried this restaurant.  the food was sooo bland and no taste.  I love thousand Island dressing and this was horrible.  My daughter used ranch and said it was horrible.  the pasta salads had no taste and I had to salt my food even though I haven't used table salt for 20 plus years.  horrible.  had a very nice waiter though, but he never refilled our waters.  the only thing that was good was the strawberry shortcake and the blueberry cakes.  other than that it was horrible and I know now to never try this restaurant again.  I will drive the extra miles for Sweet Tomatoes."}
{"text":"Food was gross. Out of almost everything. People who were working were eating instead of making food. Worst management I've ever seen. Will not go back"}
{"text":"When it's time to eat light and you are looking to eat healthy, Souper Salad, with the right choices, can be a good start. The selection of this AYCE salad line was fresh, but limited. The have the basic salad greens that you add your choice of veggies, the Cesar salad mix, and then there are several pasta and bean salads.   Once you move past the salad line, there is station with baked potato with all the toppings, pizza, and even some pretty good garlic toast. There are several soups to try, even chili with corn bread.   If you stopped now, you'd miss the soft served station with hot fudge and carmel toppings. Overall, good, fresh meal with friendly staff and a very clean line."}
{"text":"This place is always packed and especially during snow bird season! But the food is always fresh and the soups are good and usually they have three or four soups to choose from. The only thing that I would say needs improvement is the facility, the booths are torn up and dirty and the carpet is horribly dirty and according to the wife, the bathrooms are scary! But with that being said, the food is good and prices are fair and I have never had a rude employee at that establishment."}
{"text":"I went in here around 5 pm on a weekday, there was no one in the place, that should have been my first hint that it was not going to be a good experience.  I was right, I should have just turned around and leave the place.  There selection was very poor, I couldn't even find items that you would normally find a a salad bar.   Their selection of soups was very poor, maybe 4 total.  Rolls or bread was pitiful.  The help was very lackadaisical, there didn't seem any motivation to want to work.  I watch 3 others come in to get served, it would take anywhere from 5 to 10 min. before someone would come out of the back to help them.  Amazing the customers stayed to be able to eat.  i definitely wouldn't go to this particular one. I can't comment on others, but I'd rather go to Sweet Tomatoes anytime over this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic selection. Great price. All salad bar items were stocked and fresh. The soup selection was excellent and very tasty. The hot bar selection is thin but also excellent quality. The atmosphere is very cozy. Service is great. Price is very competitive."}
{"text":"Subconsciously avoiding vegetables recently I finally begin to fell the need for greens....   My need for nourishment and a COUPON for a $4.99 meal with the purchase of a beverage brought me here for lunch the other day. This location has always been clean and the servers friendly (once they make it to your table). The veggies are always green and their mixed salads appetizing and rarely wilted.   My eyes are always bigger than my tummy. The veggies piled high, I always find room on my plate for a spoon full of that wonderful tuna screwdle salad. My dressing of choice is always a little of the House Vinaigrette and a drizzle of the lo cal Ranch.   On my way around the buffet I stop at the soup station. I can never pass up their beef vegetable soup, they didn't have it on my last visit. But they usually have 4 soups to suit most tastes.  I pass by the selection of pastas, mac n cheese, baked potato and taco/nacho bar, pizza and the breads. Although there are times I can't pass up their gingerbread.   I worked through my salad and in typical Souper Salad fashion I finished my meal with a few cubes of pound cake topped with strawberries, passing on the ice cream. I should have just gone for the Jello or the fresh fruit....Oh well!   Sign up for their Fresh Club on line and you get coupons in your email regularly."}
{"text":"So I came back here. This is easier to get to than Sweet Tomatoes. And I had a coupon for a dollar off. Started my meal with some Asian twist salad, some of their tuna pasta, some quinoa black bean salad, and another pasta salad. All the pasta ones  were fantastic. On to two soups. The Santa fe chicken was ok and the twiced baked potato was fantastic. Third plate not as great. Made a taco salad which looked great but everything was blah. Had a spoon of the most depressing Mac n cheese... overcooked noodles and nacho cheese sauce. And a piece of the flatbread was ok but not memorable. But they take the cake in dessert. A cup of amazing homemade whipped cream and a sundae with brownie, soft serve, nuts, hot fudge, caramel, blueberry sauce, and strawberries for the win. Also they have good shortcake bites if you prefer strawberry shortcake."}
{"text":"Like a poor mans version of Sweet Tomatoes. Less choices and less flavor. It's pretty disappointing. Spend the extra couple bucks and drive down the street to a better salad bar, or go to a real restaurant"}
{"text":"Went to clean men's room to wash my hands. Touched my greasy chair. Yuck.   Nacho cheese watery. Blue cheese.had little flavor. Alfredo pasta and macaroni and cheese were ok. Ample salad selections. Red potato salad was lacking flavor.  Taco meat was not appealing. Kyu said hers  at home were better. Correct. Pizza was the highlight. Tasty and hot  Ice cream mix with chocolate syrup, peanuts and Oreo chips. Was a good finish. About 10 people at 3 pm."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Souper Salads since the first appeared in Phoenix 15-20 years ago. I like that they're more affordable the some competitors.  It's pretty basic for seating and things but the salad bar is long and full of standard salad fixings. The salad here is usually fresh and I have no complaints at all.  My kids would eat here 3x a week if I'd let them."}
{"text":"I love Souper Salad!  It's not as awesome as some of the other salad joints, but its half the cost as many of them and it's got all the regular items I expect - two lettuces, spinach, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. plus 3-4 soups, baked potatoes, bread sticks and more.  This location is still a favorite with the super high ceiling.  It's showing it's age (needs to be repainted) but I'm here for the food!"}
{"text":"First time here.......aaaaaaaannnnnd...my last time.  Look, I am totally a soup and salad girl.  I love fresh veggies and fruit and can always get down with a nice hot soup, especially during the winter.  I have always been a little curious about this place but for some reason  my inner foodie resisted the motivation to actually ever try it.  Well, I rebelled last night in act of pure desperation.  We were attempting to go to Bonefish (next door) but there was a long wait and we had a movie to catch....so, we gave it a whirl....  I could easily pick this place apart from the atmosphere, the bright lighting and the service but I would rather just simplify...  Bottom line...the salad bar was decent...the lettuce was a little brown and looked old.  The spinach in particular was sticking to the bottom of the serving tray...They had decent options for toppings but nothing that was super fresh or exciting.   The fruit was okay and semi-fresh.  The pasta salad section looked okay although I didn't get that adventurous...it basically looked like pasta tossed with mayo so I took a pass..  Next, the soup bar...they had a couple options but most of them looked pretty pukity.  The one I tried was actually decent...loaded with salt but certainly edible.  It was a butter bean soup and it was actually a vegan option which was pretty cool.  They had other \"things\" to choose from but some of them were literally unidentifiable (is that even a word??)  The pizza looked like it was from ci-ci's, the tacos looked like they were from taco bell and the soft serve was milk and sugar frozen.    I KNOW, I KNOW...I shouldn't expect much for 7 bucks and all things considered, it wasn't THAT bad but it wasn't good either.  I felt kinda gross just sitting in there though..just something about it...bleh  Your better bet??  Go to Harris Teeter (the Tajmateeter in Southpark in particular) and hit up their salad bar, fresh sushi and soup options."}
{"text":"Super yummy. Have always loved coming to Souper salad! This location was clean and had good food. If you do not like salads this is not the best place for you because the other choices were not very good. Except the corn pasta was AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Apparently do not go on a Friday night when the coupons come out in the winter time. This was the busiest place I have been to in a long time. First all the trays and plates were sopping wet leaving a puddle where they sat. Second the vegetables were sliced either too big for your plate or so small they almost didn't exist. Third, no time was taken to clean up the messes people were leaving behind and veggies and dressings were being cross contaminated. The server on the other hand was very nice and was working her tail off. This is the second time I have been to this location and was just as disappointed then as I am now. Sorry but I will not be returning. Good salad place recommendations would be greatly appreciated."}
{"text":"SouperSalad : Sweet Tomatoes  =  Church's : KFC.  I like it better than SweetTom, even though the selection isn't really any larger, it just has more meat available, whether in their soups or at their rudimentary built-yer-own-taco bar.    Recommendation is still to go when and only if you have a coupon, otherwise it's simply not worth the price.    These guys get bonus point for offering \"permanent\" coupons for $5.50-ish price, and have that price all day Tuesday without a coupon."}
{"text":"We have been to Soup&Salad many time before this visit but never had to get a different soup because the first was bland and tasteless only to try a second which was different but tasted the same as the first.  Yes the place was full of seniors like us but we do live on a fixed income and try to eat healthy. For the same $ you can eat at Golden Corral and the selection is fantastic and before 4 PM the drinks are free. The staff was friendly and counters were clean."}
{"text":"We tried for lunch today and three stars is fitting. The salad bar offers above average variety and is well tended, but the soups were below average. I tried both the broccoli cheese and the vegetable beef and both had some strong off flavors. I didn't try the miscellaneous items at the end such as tacos, chili, and nachos because they were not particularly attractive and not worth the calories and saturated fat -- I came here to eat healthy!  Souper salad is pricey in my book (I don't get the senior discount), upwards of $10 for the salad and a drink.  Don't go out of your way to eat here, but stop by if you're nearby and need a healthy option."}
{"text":"This place just doesn't trip my trigger. The price is about average for a lunch buffet, but the selection is not. It is laid out all wrong.They have the plates at the end of the salad bar which is walled in to allow a line of people to walk on either side. When going for another plate, you have to squeeze past the people getting salad to get another plate. Then unless you get another salad, you have to squeeze past them again to go to the other buffet tables. Easy remedy would to have a plate holder at each station, or remove the wall. The dessert table is at the end of the salad bar and ahead of the soup table. The nachos and cheese are at the very end, but you have to go back wards to get the taco meat and salsa. If you want black olives, jalapeno peppers, or onions, you have to squeeze past all those people in line at the salad bar because that's where these items are located. To top it off, the Ice cream machine was broken.  Now about the quality. I liked one of the 4 soups they offered. The twice baked potato soup was pretty good. Now I know what they do with all of yesterday's baked potatoes. The Italian wedding soup, not very good, and I'm part Italian I would know. The pizza is one of the worst pizzas I've had. It's like they put toppings and tomato sauce on a flour tortilla and baked it a few minutes. The crust was limp and doughy. the sauce was very bland, and the toppings barely cooked. The macaroni and cheese was like wallpaper paste. The noodles over cooked the cheese sticky and gooey. It tasted ok, I didn't care for the texture. The baked sweet potato was mush in a skin. There's no other way to describe it. Again a texture thing. The only redeeming quality I found was the salad bar, and as I've stated it's set up wrong. The salad and toppings were fresh, There were several dressings to choose from.  As far al lunch buffets go, I'd rather spend just a little more and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's ok...been here a few times. Reasonable price and what they serve is fresh. Great service staff.  The  soups have always been good.  A bit sparse on salad and fruit varieties. Not sure if it is different on weekends.  You can dress up baked or sweet potatos with lots of fixings. Actually...think I would rather pay a few more bucks and go to Sweet Tomatos, but it is entirely a matter of preference."}
{"text":"Next time... Sweet tomatoes. Cold nacho cheese, bland salads. Greasy taco meat, decent soup. No pastas. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Souper salad, as in soup or salad, or even super salad? More like never ever again. This was my first and last time eating here. My fiancé and I were trying this thing where she eats healthy and I wish I had the willpower to do the same so she chose to come here so she could have salad and I could have my fill of soup and whatever. This place is like an Old Country buffet gone terribly worse (because they've already gone so wrong). Firstly, the guy at the register was really condescending. I've ever been here so I was looking at menu above him to see what it was all about/prices when he asked my fiancé what he could get us, when my fiancé said we were going to do the AYCE (as opposed to carry out), the cashier was just like, \"well this is an AYCE restaurant.\" Well, no shit but if that was the case why did you ask us what you could get us in the first place? The salad bar portion isn't so bad, it's like a deluxe Ruby Tuesday salad bar with an extended pasta salad portion. They had this weird fettuccine and corn pasta salad and I like corn so I tried it and I literally could not stop but that's pretty much the only thing I liked. I tried the clam chowder (my favorite soup) which was really salty and some meatball and wild rice soup which was extremely under salted. I just couldn't win. They had taco stuff and nachos but I didn't try it. They have an ice cream machine and various desserts like bite size brownies and stuff to make a strawberry shortcake but everything was dry to me. It was really cheap though and we left full (but not satisfied) but on the way home we found a food truck feastival and instantly regretted eating all the crappy soup and salad at Souper Salad."}
{"text":"Ladies and gentlemen, we are not talking about a souper elegant fine dining experience. This is a salad buffet at a very reasonable price. For the price of a burger meal, you can load up your plate with whichever veggies you like, a choice of soups, and a few other \"things\".  The veggies are generally very crisp and fresh, good variety, and decent dressing. I enjoy it very much.  I like a good salad, and I guess I build them pretty well.    Good choices, clean, decent all around.  I can eat healthy and enjoy it... I'm sold."}
{"text":"I've been to other Souper Salads and I really like the location of this one.  nestled in a quaint part of a quaint shopping center.  Server staff could use some refining.

{"text":"This is not Sweet Tomatos. That said, the actual salad bar makes me pretty darned happy. The soups are salty enough to cause a stroke and therefore completely inedible, the breads are junk, and the rest of the stuff is pure crap. 3 stars because the salad stuff is fresh and there's enough variety so that my salads never have to taste the same. Can't beat it for the price!!  UPDATE:  Sweet Tomatos has recently down graded their quality and now this place goes from 3 stars to 4!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what made me wanting to try this place... I'm still sick from eating there. How can a salad bar NOT be fresh and have more canned options? Eveything was at room temperature... the lettuce was warm and wilted... the dressings warm... the pasta salads crusted over... the nacho cheese... really? At a salad bar? The soups were warmed up from a can... the pizza reminded me of what I got in forth grade... the breads... really?  Why... why... why. This franchise should take study from places like Souplantation or Fresh Choice...   This place was soooo bad, I left after six bites... so not worth $7:49... not worth a cent."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place every week, 20 years ago... I was there last week and it was horrible.. The macaroni salad tasted really bad, the salad bar was rough looking, the strawberry desert was mush and the pizza was as thin as paper with one slice of pepperoni on it. Years ago they had large slices of pizza, nice corn bread and great salads. Oh, the dipping cheese looked like thick yellow paint. I could only eat half my plate and had to leave. Never going back..."}
{"text":"Good selection and the price point is great! Some of the food looks like it's left out for a while, but at the same time the service is great and I was glad we went!"}
{"text":"Souper Salad and I have never really bonded.  Sure, we've had a few laughs, but generally by the time we part ways it kinda feels like wasted time.  Not that I haven't been properly filled, but for the price I could have gotten better.  And often healthier.    Ya see, the big secret is that most of this stuff isn't healthy.  Sure some of it is, but it is ALL about control.  And who's ever heard of control in an All you can eat place?  ................Exactly.  And between the bread, pizza, creamy pasta salads and the dessert section with ice cream - didn't you just ruin the whole \"Healthy lunch of salad\" concept?  I remember liking the baked potato bar.  We had good times.  And every once in awhile a those garbanzo beans really hit the spot on the salad.  But several of the times I've gone I feel like the lettuce is wilty or in some other way less than appetizing.  And often other ingredients look similar.  Last time I got a baked potato it was under cooked fairly substantially.    Can you enjoy a meal there?  Sure.  Would I suggest putting this into the regular rotation?  Most likely no."}
{"text":"This place is a standard salad bar, similar to Sweet Tomatoes if you can compare it to that. I ate here one evening because at the time there were no Sweet Tomatoes in Mesa or Gilbert and I was really needing my salad fix!  First thing I noticed was how filthy the salad bar was. It was seriously a mess...goopy salad dressing smeared all over, lettuce everywhere, vegetables that looked like they hadn't been wiped off the counter for hours. It was just gross to see that type of a mess in a buffet line.   The place was packed for a weeknight so I figured it was going to taste pretty good, or as good as salad buffet can be. The selection was mediocre at best, without too many options for salad toppings, and worst of all- the lettuce had seen its share of better days. It was wilted and browned. Plus if I remember correctly, there was an overabundance of iceberg lettuce and virtually no romaine and no spinach.   The soup was equally as disappointing. One of the soups was so salty it almost seemed like it was a mistake, like they accidentally doubled the sodium in the recipe. Ugh. I tried the other soups thinking they'd be better but all of them tasted like they came from a mix, or something out of a can. There was no distinct flavor to anything. I left thinking, is this it? Even so, I returned a second time to see if maybe it was just an off-day, plus I needed another salad fix. Well, same story, different day- dirty restaurant, and questionable food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in the Metrocenter area to visit.  I first starting going about four years ago after my workplace (which is in the area) had coupons (I miss those too!)  Was really glad to find them.  It's a buffet based around soups and salads with most of the items available being more healthier alternatives than you'd usually find at a buffet.  Now of course, there will be those that say \"Well, what good is it to eat healthier if you're at an all you can eat place - doesn't that defeat the purpose?\"  But if you're going to go to an all you can eat place, i'd much rather overindulge in lower calorie fare than gorge down item after item that's filled with fat each!    But as much of a plus that may be, the food itself is the main draw - everything is absolutely delish!  Their chili, gingerbread, and sweet potatoes are favorite items!  Sometimes it takes a while after you walk in for someone to man the register and get you started but that's one of my few qualms about this place.  Another recent reviewer said that it's a good place to visit and chat with a friend and indeed i have chosen it as a date location before.  Nice, comfortable, and relaxed!  Very good value for the price."}
{"text":"Not the greatest selection,  I was charged over 10 dollars when the reviews I read stated it was under that.  The service was nice but not worth coming back. They should have a bigger soup selection. Also on the taco meat don't add so much cumin...that was brutal."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location in a while but I was pleasantly surprised with the remodel and the amount of waiters clearing plates and tables. Seemed like it was much cleaner than before and I enjoyed my salad & garlic breadsticks. I also love the cubes ham at this place. I know it's super cheap and low quality but it reminds me of my Grandma taking us to Souper Salad when I was younger. I'll definitely be back since things are much better with the remodel!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok.  I have eaten there and had better quality.  The pizza seemed to have been sitting there for hours.  The baked potatoes were over cooked as they had been there a long time also.  The young lady Faith introduced herself as our waitress and said if there was anything we needed to let her know.  The only function she serviced was removing our dirty dishes from the table and never smiled the entire time.  She had the appearance of wishing she was somewhere else.   She never offered to refill our drinks, unlike the other waitress who was working there.That waitress was refilling drinks at all of the tables she was working without being asked and had a very nice smile while doing so. We just picked the wrong table to sit at."}
{"text":"I came to Souper Salad right after getting rejected by a closeby Quiznos that didn't accept my online coupon (a story I will write next).  I asked them if they had any specials, and they offered a coupon for free drinks with no questions asked.  I have been to Soupplantation/Sweet Tomatoes several times, so I was expecting something similar.    I first came to the salad bar, and I noticed that there were a lot of variety of vegetables and even meats.  At Sweet Tomatoes, you usually have to pay a little extra for chicken.    The sides were pretty tasty too with 3 different kind of soups, pizza, pasta, and nachos.  So far 3 good points to the meal, and then comes the extras.  They had a cinnamon roll bread to die for.  It tasted especially good with a little ice cream on top.  I will pleasantly happy after a bad experience from Quiznos."}
{"text":"Cheap and low-quality  A decent selection at a fair price, but the quality is far less than Sweet Tomatoes.  The salad bar wasn't kept fresh (wilted lettuce, low containers), the pizza was like a frozen type (crappy crust and sauce), greasy/oil atop of the meat for the tacos.  I won't go on.  On that note, it serves the purpose for a buffet - mass quantities for the masses.  I will not go back.  I would prefer to spend $3-4 extra dollars to go to Sweet Tomatoes any day."}
{"text":"When this place first opened in the \"nuclear reactor\" trust building it was terrific.  Good fresh food and we used to take our growing kids and have them load up.  A bargain.  Then Sweet Tomatoes opened up across the freeway.  The variety and freshness there just tops this place.  Sadly we've watched this restaurant get older, a little dirtier and the food not quite as good as it was.  However the prices are quite a bit lower than across the freeway and there us the nostalgia element for us empty nesters.  I love the salad and the blueberry bread is the bomb - makes me eat too much and offset the salad.  They are courteous and speedy with a tea refill which is nice.  The yogurt machine can get nasty so they need to clean that more.  It is a good meal."}
{"text":"First off, I hate buffets! This was my husbands choice and he hates buffets more than I do.  Friday about 6:30 we find the place very busy! Pay our $30 and try to find a seat that the sun is not blazing on.  If you like buffets and salad this place is for you. I love salad but I have difficulties eating it. Lots of choices. All produce seemed fresh. They have several cold ready made salads too, today the potato salad had a pool of liquid in the bottom of the tray. Pass.  Hot food bar had taco fixings, cracker thin pizza, chili and nacho cheese. I did try a hand full of chips with cheese and taco meat. I would have made full blown nachos but a impatient man was invading my personal space so I moved on. The ground beef taco meat was very good. Above average. Soups looked like run of the mill. Watered down broccoli cheese. I did try the vegetable beef, had great flavor but should have been called potato chunk soup.   Self serve ice milk and coke machines round out the experience.  There was nothing wrong with my visit. And I guess $30 for 2 adults and a child isnt bad with beverages included. I am just not a fan of these types of places"}
