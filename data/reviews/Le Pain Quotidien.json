{"text":"Vinimos a desayunar en familia. La verdad es que todo es riquisimo pero tuvimos un problemon con la mesa. Eramos 6 personas pero vinimos por separado. Como no estabamos todos, no agrandaron la mesa sino que pusieron 2 sillas más en una mesa de 4. Es más, los mozos se pelearon entre ellos sobre cómo ubicarnos. Pésimo."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed.  

I looked forward to having brunch here for the last few days, only to be sorely let down.  Maybe it's because I just returned from Paris, where the bakeries and cafes are out of this world, but Le Pain Quotidien really missed its mark for me.  

We came here for brunch today with some friends.  My partner and I both ordered omelets.  It was small and dried beyond belief.  Under salted and tasteless.  The mixed greens provided were tiny on a large plate. The bread while good was not particularly special or interesting.  

Our friends had french toast and soft-boiled eggs with bread.  The french toast looked good (although hard), but the soft-boiled eggs came out hard.  The waiter did return it (points for him), but coupled with the overdone omelets, over cooked eggs seemed to be a pattern at Le Pain Quotidien.  

Admittedly, the croissant and pain au chocolat were good (although we've had better and at cheaper prices).  The organic brioche was a far cry from what we had in Paris and simply not worth the almost $3.00 paid for it.  

For the relatively steep prices, I would not come here for brunch again."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance, nice servers, delicious food. Prices are very reasonable and you are bound to find something on the menu that appeals.

I recommend you grab a baguette on your way out, too. I was suprised at how good it was. Nice crispy yet chewy crust, and an airy interior."}
{"text":"There aren't many places in Yorkville where you can pop in for a bite that won't set you back two paycheques. Le Pain Quotidien, happily, is not one of those places! 

Late on a Saturday afternoon, my stomach proceeded to notify me that it was empty and required nourishment. Who am I to argue? I ventured to the closest place I could find that didn't require a dress, heels and my fur, which happened to be LPQ.

The space is pleasantly decorated. It's warm and inviting, and the pastry case alone is enough to turn me into one of Pavlov's dogs. LPQ was not overly crowded, considering the time of day, and I was seated as soon as I walked in. The server was very helpful, very sweet, and, um, very cute. He answered my questions (like what the hell is a terrine?) and didn't keep me waiting forever to take my order.

Speaking of terrines, I ordered the prosciutto and apricot terrine. It was very well presented and, after verifying that I ate it with my hands (reminder: I was in Yorkville), I dug in. It was good, but not outstanding, although I'm not sure I expected fireworks and backflips over a sandwich. The cheese and prosciutto was slightly dry, but overall, it did the trick. My bowl of cafe au lait complemented the sandwich, and my sleepiness, nicely.

Then, of course, came my least favourite time during dining out in Toronto -- waiting for the cheque. It drives me absolutely bonkers that every single time I eat out, it takes the server 20 minutes to bring me my cheque. It's as if once I'm served, the waiter goes on a two hour smoke break! I really do try to appreciate that they aren't rushing me out of the restaurant, but at least bring me the cheque and *then* let me sit there! But I digress. I finally got up, found my waiter, and paid at the front.

Side note: I really did want to try a pastry, what with my seriously bad sweet tooth, but it took him so long to come back to my table (actually, he never did), that I bailed and figured it probably wasn't worth waiting for anyway. One day I may go back and try a sweet for my sweet tooth.

For a quick meal, LPQ is a good, affordable choice."}
{"text":"Yes, the food is pretty good.
Yes, the overall ambiance is quaint and a nice departure from typical Torontonian fare.

BUT...they have one of the worst wait staffs of any restaurant in the city. Expect to wait 10-15 before getting your order down unless you want to get up to go to the counter and tell them you're ready. Then service throughout is slow, far and wide apart even if there is only one other table in the restaurant. When you finally get the bill (which, trust me is a challenging feat as not one waiter will look at you to see if you need anything), it takes them forever to bring you your change even if what you're waiting for is evidently not the tip. 

I am not one to write reviews like this nor am I one to complain but after initially loving the food and atmosphere of Le Pain Quotidien and then repeatedly being disappointed in the last few times I have gone, I now vow to never go back based solely on the fact that such negligent and rude service could upset what should have been a relaxing lunch. I am very understanding of waiters who have bad days and never do I act rude to those who help me but it just becomes ridiculous when I'm giving a 15-20% tip for my waiter to be socializing at the front with their coworkers and I have to repeatedly (on several different visits) get up and fetch them so I could have my food or my bill.

Not to mention, portions here at the Yorkville location are half of what they used to be. 

Seriously, don't bother coming here. I promise you'll be better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Otro local snob del nuevo centrito de Av Libertador y Corrientes, en Olivos. 
Se la dan de veganos pero te ofrecen pollo y pescado.
 
Una lágrima, un jugo de manzana que parecía limonada y un muffin $159
Sándwiches para llevar $130

Hay algunos platos \"sanos\" interesantes. Algún tiramisú y medialunas rellenas. Todo muy estúpidamente afrancesado.

La atención fue correcta y rápida.

Lugar ideal para los que les gusta pagar una fortuna por un \"suave colchón de hojas verdes\"."}
{"text":"El nuevo local de Le Pain Quotidien está ubicado en la entrada del edificio La Palmera en la esquina de Corrientes y Libertador.

Ya había ido al de Palermo y no tuve una buena experiencia. Solo basta con decir que tuve que pedir tres veces una cuchara para poder revolver el café. 

Pero este nuevo local se veía tan bien que fui igual. El resultado fue totalmente distinto al de Palermo. La atención muy buena.
Pedí un waffle belga con frutas con un café y un jugo de manzana y jengibre y estaba todo muy rico.
El precio sabemos que puede un poquito más elevado que en otros lados pero está bien.

El local es bastante grande, con bastantes mesas adentro y afuera. Hasta los baños son amplios.

Siento que debería darle cuatro estrellas solo para equilibrar con mi opinión del LPQ de Palermo, pero voy a ser bueno porque nada que ver uno con el otro."}
{"text":"Le Pain Quotidien has a nice location, nice atmosphere, average service (for Toronto) and ridiculously overpriced and under-flavoured food. One doesn't have to be picky to be disappointed with the tiny and sparsely filled omelettes. But for a place that specializes in bread, the bread wasn't really special. Ditto for the chocolate croissant, which was barely a notch up from Michel's Baguette. Enough said."}
{"text":"I was walking by for a quick snack and decided to pop in to this cute bakery with a friend. It looked like a cute cafe from the outside. Though the pastries were delicious looking, I can't say they tasted fantastic. Particularly the $3 Spinach and Feta pastry I bought which had little filling. I was also hoping for a seating area for a quick eat and go, but customers had to leave if they were not planning to sit and eat for a meal. And so, I ate my dry flaky thing while walking in the harsh Toronto winter."}
{"text":"Gran Cafe, no defrauda. Un pie de chocolate belga demoledor y el lugar soñado. Quizas lo mas flojito es el servicio, pero es un mal de esta epoca."}
{"text":"Pretty pastries.  Pretty people.  But a pretty average meal.

I rolled out of bed to meet some friends for brunch. 
Saturday at noon and there is a huge lineup.  They told us it's a 15 minute wait.  It sure wasn't!  If you are a couple, the wait is less bad, but we were a group of four and it took awhile.

I like the wood tables, the space is sunny and the breads displayed look tasty.

I had a tartine, it was an interesting open faced sandwich with prosciutto, apricots, and pesto smothered with olive oil.  The sweet and salty mix was delicious!

I ordered a cafe latte in a bowl.  I like drinking out of bowls, it's fun.
However, the place was so cold that my latte went cold pretty quickly too.  So, I never ended up finishing it. 

I also had the pain au chocolat for $3.00.
For three bucks, I'm expecting a fantastic croissant.
It wasn't flaky or crispy... and it's wasn't very chocolately. 
Fail.

The portions are Yorkville diet small.  I was still hungry. 
They had organic cherry jam, marmalade, and hazelnut spread.
I started eating that... without bread. So yeah..."}
{"text":"Se ubica en la esquina de Corrientes y Libertador, y comparte PB con La Panaderia de Pablo, Le Pain Quotidien, Megatlon y proximamente el tan esperado Carne.

Atención amable y rapida, aunque con falencias en la memoria, pidiendo dos rolls, un cafe y un jugo no hay mucho al error, pero bueno tres veces preguntaron por el cafe... solo? no cortado... solo? no cortado... adivinen como vino... si solo !!!

Precios acordes. Productos con un poco mas de amor que el que note en Alto Palermo.

Hay varias mesas individuales para los antisociales y la tan temible mesa comunal que al parecer habiendo otras opciones hay gente que la elije.

Local luminoso, pero si te sentas del lado que pega el sol te vas a cocinar en pleno verano.

Lo destacable: la decoracion exterior armada con estructuras de macetas.

Aceptan tarjetas, con AMEX tinen descuento del 20%, y por el momento tiene estacionamiento cubierto y gratuito sin limite de tiempo."}
{"text":"Cadena belga que llega a Olivos a darle cada vez más opciones a esta creciente parte del barrio. Ubicado en el edificio de La Palmera que ya casirbtabpro finalizar sus obras. También está la opción de la Panadería de Pablo, próximamente CARNE y una sucursal más de Lucciano's helados. Mega TOP! Llegamos temprano antes de la 1 del mediodía por eso conseguimos lugar en una mesita f ellas que están afuera en un sector armado con repisas de hierro y madera cerca de la vereda. La atención es relajada pero muy buena! Los camareros son muy simpático y buenos anfitriones. La carta totalmente naturista como se sabe, productos frescos. Comimos dos tartines, unos de ternera y otro de langostinos. No me gusto que el mío de langostinos que llevaba mango según carta no lo tenga y no me hayan avisado, pero obviamente estaba delicioso igual! De postre probamos el tiramisu algo distinto y el mozo muy amable nos recomendó probarlo con un poco de miel de agave que el mismo nos alcanzó a la mesa, lindo detalle.

Para compartir! Porción generosa!

Al paso vi varios brunch! Súper abundantes para dos! Mi tapiz ima vez será la opción que tome! Y las ensaladas de las veia también abundantes!

La ambientación hermosa el baño impecable! 

Y adentro tenes opción de take away bakery como también productos como mermeladas mieles, postres etc..."}
{"text":"I visited Le Pain Quotidien on Eglinton W for the 2nd time for brunch this past Sunday. Both times I would give Le Pain high marks for its dining experience.

This most recent visit, I ordered their specialty sandwich, the Tartine. It is presented in an open faced manner, sliced into five small slices, on a flat wooden plank. I chose the chicken and smoked mozzarella option for $10.95, which was served with a garlic pesto mayo.

As far as serving size was concerned, I would say that my appetite was quite satiated, while at the same time, I did not walk away feeling stuffed (which in my mind is a good thing).

My girlfriend chose one of the omelettes (which cost in the $8 - $10 range), which she was generous enough to let me have a small taste. I asked her how she liked it. She gave it generally high marks. The only negative comment was that she found the eggs to be a bit on the greasy side. 

Also, ordered at the table was the french toast (by my girlfriend's brother), and the curried chicken tartine (by my girlfriend's mother's partner). There were no complaints all around.

To drink, I ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice, which was quite refeshing. The only downside was the cost. A small glass was $4.50. I probably should have paid closer attention to the cost on the menu, as $4.50 came as quite a shock when the bill arrived.

As far as decor is concerned, I have to echo the prior review and say that it is quite unique in that there is a huge communal table in the middle of the room, which gives the room a more homey feel. 

Also noted was the huge skylight, which provided a lot of natural light.

On the downside, because of the open feel of the restaurant, the noise levels were quite high. Thus if you are looking to bring your parents or your grandparents who may be hard of hearing, this fact may cause quite a conversational barrier."}
{"text":"Came here the other day before work. I love working in the area because there are so many places to explore. Love the interior. It's serene with a skylight... perfect for relaxing. From 8:30 to about 9:30 (the time I was there), it was pretty quiet. This is probably due to the fact that if you live in this upscale area, you actually HAVE to work.

I ordered the coffee and French Toast. It was delish! Who knew that you could make FT with a baguette."}
{"text":"A great open space to sit and enjoy some pastries or a quick lunch bite. They have a nice selection of tartines (open face sandwich creations) and I had a very well balanced quiche Lorraine with a white bean soup.

Great selection of baked goods and wide open windows with a nice mix of \"interesting\" people to watch. You can also do your stroll through Yorkville after grabbing a crepe at crepes a go go next door.

Overall, a nice place to sit and relax on a weekend."}
{"text":"This is part of an international chain with its origins in Belgium. The decor of the Eglinton Store is marvelous. They have invested a great deal of moneyto  include an enormous skylight that brings both lights and 'warmth' to the locale.

This was a much awaited chain. And just like most of the bakeries in Europe (more than 60%) not much is baked on the premises. Let me clear not much baking is made from scratch starting in the wee hours of the morning. Things may be baked in ovens, using only organic product (??). Their coffee (fair trade, ???trade, ??????, is not much beyond 401 Service Centre quality.

Does this place have high standards? I am sure their corporate literature is rife with them. Their website sings a song to their commitment and culture....BUT

The breads are average, the selection mediocre, the service nonchalant, and the overall experience not memorable. These digressions are re-emphasized by the prices which are stiff. People this is the not the Cafe de la Paix!

When it comes to this restaurant it seems that the road to hell  paved with good intentions. It is not a place I will return to."}
{"text":"I eat here quite often when I'm in the area and the Cobb & Nicoise salads are just great, healthy and very tasty! The baked goods are phenomenal and are high in demand so if you want to get your hands on any - show up early!!!  Staff is pretty friendly and diligent, but the place does get quite busy and noisy sometimes (-1 pt) and getting your food during peak times can take awhile."}
{"text":"Hemos ido a muchas sucursales de esta cadena (tanto aquí como en el exterior), pero en la de olivos, fue en la única que nos dijeron q no tenían opción de comida para chicos: aclaro, gralmente tienen un menú aparte con opciones infantiles o con las mismas del menú pero con otro acompañamiento y sin salsas. Tampoco nos dieron la opción de cambiar algo en los platos de adultos. 
Nos terminamos yendo, ya que al haber ido de noche, no contaban con la carta diaria de por lo menos, algún sándwich. 

Algo a cambiar para las familias..."}
{"text":"Funny story, I was really feeling like having crepes this morning and thought I might head over to Crepes a Go Go. Google Maps showed me it was right on the corner of Yorkville and Yonge and I just ran to the corner. I ended up completely overlooking the signs and walked right into Le Pain Quotidien thinking it was Crepes a Go Go!! I was confused out of my mind thinking why they weren't making crepes (I only found out once I left and looked back only to see Crepes a Go Go next door!).

Regardless I'm sort of glad I stumbled into Le Pain Quotidien. I didn't even up getting my crepes by I ended up buying a whole wad of delicious pastries. This place is exactly what I've wanted in a great bakery. All sorts of interesting, fresh, pastries and desserts as well as great sandwiches and breakfast food. As made obvious by their name \"Le Pain Quotidien\" which translates into \"The Daily Bread\", they serve all sorts of fresh quality bread.

The staff is quick and friendly and although this place is a bit expensive, I know where to get a quick fix for my sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while poking around this neighborhood looking for a place to do some work and grab some lunch.  They don't have wi-fi which is too bad, but in reality wi-fi leads to distraction, so I was able to be a little more productive without it I suppose.

The decor is adorable - they have a bunch of small tables along with a large communal table.  The service was attentive and fast.  

Two things impressed me most and will keep me coming back - the delicious mushroom omelette was made with organic eggs (for only $10 or so - well priced considering!).   I also loved that a variety of their beverages were sweetened with agave nectar rather than sugar - this allowed me to chug my mint-lemonade with minimal guilt - which by the way, came in a small pitcher - all for $3.50!

I cannot wait to explore this menu - it was totally yummy and a relaxed environment.  There were a plethora of baked goods that were tempting me that might lure me back sometime in the near future.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"It's over priced, it's tiny portions and they can not accommodate a group of anything bigger then 6....they can, but they have no idea how to seat them or serve them.

I will say, the bread is great...I would only go there to buy bread.....

it's a BIG miss!"}
{"text":"I only popped in for a pain au chocolat. I was not impressed. Not only was it more expensive here than at other patisseries, the pastry itself was horrible.  I'm glad Chris P mentions it in his review with his experience with a croissant. There was absolutely nothing redeeming about my pain au chocolat."}
{"text":"If you're one of those people that is drawn to anything remotely European- this place is your haven. 

Unlike any brunch joint I've ever seen in Toronto. They have a HUGE sunlight that makes the place glow (what I believe heaven might resemble...) and all the furniture is a light wood color that looks as if it was just constructed in a barn down the street (like Jesus built them since we're going with religious metaphors). This is the type of place one could end up writing the next canonic piece of literature. 

I did not eat anything worth mentioning (I was too dazzled by the atmosphere to consider eating...) but as I was eavesdropping on everyones plates and desserts, I can tell you 'BOY, does that shtuff ever look tasty!'. 

Coffee was also tasty.
Highly recommend if only to walk in and use the washroom."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good. I had a smoked salmon salad I can still remember. Tasty. Service is friendly. The prices are pretty expensive... Just under $4 for a chocolate chip cookie, I'm expecting this to be the best chocolate chip cookie of my life. It was good but not amazing. They seem to run out of the baked goods whenever I go. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but it's a pretty good spot."}
{"text":"Another 3.5 star review!

Even though I generally try to stay away from 'chains', I've made Pan Quotidien an exception in the past, mainly because of their absolutely perfect spreads.
During my time in New York, I frequented one of the Upper East Side locations since it was exactly between my apartment and work! Hence a direct comparison with one of the two Toronto location is fair.
It seems that the Canadian branch is less generous than those south of the border. The baker's basket which is generally meant for a few people was basically just enough for me! It also took about 15 minutes for the basket to arrive and I was a little puzzled with regards to how long it could possibly take for a few slices of bread to be selected and put in a basket. 
During one of the visits in Toronto, I also tried the pesto omelette, which is a decent choice but not particularly amazing!

On the more impressive side of things, the \"Belgian Hot Chocolate' is to my surprise the best I've had in Toronto. The melted chocolate is provided separately from the cup of warm milk and you basically can mix it in the proportion that is to your liking. 
The Rhubarb and Sour Cherry jams, which I had not tried in the US locations, were absolutely amazing and worth a try (the Rhubarb was particularly good!). Needless to say the 'Brunette' spread (chocolate-hazlenut) they are known for was also as fantastic as always!

I would recommend Le Pain Quotidien if you are in the mood for some fresh bread and jam for breakfast. Then again, unless you are interested in the hot chocolate, I would just get all those things to go and enjoy them at home for a fraction of the price. 
I must note that this is a great spot to go if you have small children/babies in the group. They are very accommodating (good management) and the fact that it is roomy makes it more comfortable for everyone."}
{"text":"Los mozos que nos tocaron muy buenos, pedí un café y un tostado y como el tostado llego más tarde me propusieron ofrecerme un nuevo café. Les falta un poquito de organización por ser nuevo, ya que varios mozos vinieron a preguntar si podían retirar mientras estábamos comiendo.
Pedí también una ensalada muuy rica con humus de remolacha queso de cabra hojas verdes y melón, súper recomendable. 
El lugar es divino muy linda la ambientación, la luz y la limpieza. 
También tienen comida para comprar y llevar en un sector que sería como un mini súper. 
Muuuuuy recomendadoo nos encanto"}
{"text":"I was quite surprised at how large this location was considering its location in Yorkville.  The decor is nice with the look of an old bakery.  On a sunny day it is like you are sitting on a patio enjoying your breakfast as there are lots of large, east facing windows.  

I came for breakfast, but wish I had come for dessert.  The pastries look fabulous!  I ended up getting a yogurt parfait and croissant, while my wife got an oatmeal and croissant.  The yogurt was really good.  It had fresh fruit on top with a sprig of mint.  The granola was extremely good and had a richness that I cannot describe.  I tried some of the oatmeal which also had fresh fruit and mint on it.  The oatmeal was light and creamy but nothing really stood out about it.

For a French place I would have expected the croissants to be outstanding but they unfortunately were not.  They were crisp and flaky but not as buttery as I would expect.  This may have been that they seemed slightly over cooked.

Aside from the light breakfast options they also have a lunch and dinner menu.  They sell different spreads, jams, breads (made with 100% organic flour), tea, coffee, and more.

This place is high quality and well worth your money."}
{"text":"Le Pain Quotidien went out of business... a bankruptcy notice displayed on the front door....."}
{"text":"I like going to Le Pain Quotidien on Sunday mornings to have a light breakfast and just stroll around the area all day. 

The staff is always very friendly. The food is good but I must say their spreads for the breads (range from jams to chocolates- kinda like nutella but WAY better..because they have a dark and a white choc. version) are fantastic. Maybe it's cause I like the way they have it set up or maybe it's because it's really good their bread spreads always get me.. lol probably not a good thing if I'm working on my fitness. Regardless it's still amazing. 

I DO need to mention though that while the staff is nice the new manager they have has really let the ball drop. Previously the owner was around but I hear she has moved back to New York and in doing so this place has lost some stars in my book. 

While I am a fan of this place I don't think it would be fitting to give it 4 starts because things seem to have gone down hill. 

However, they do have great pastries and if I may suggest the chocolate croissant. Can you tell I love chocolate?? I think I've mentioned it twice in this review!"}
