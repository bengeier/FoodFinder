{"text":"My ex introduced me to this take out place many many years ago. Must say the food quality stayed same or got better. Never been disappointed with the food or the service, knowledgeable staff always available to provide what you want. Food price are fair. 

Try to go with a Tamil as they would know the dishes best. Kothu roti is must try."}
{"text":"Babu, you make this lady very happy!

I eat Babu take-out once a week when working in Scarborough.  I always default the responsibility for ordering to my Tamil grandmothers* who tipped me onto the place a few years ago (*not biological grandmothers).  Group ordering is the way to go with Babu to ensure you get the widest variety of deliciousness available.

Everything I have had from there is consistently mind-blowing, especially the Malaysian noodles and the veg. curry string hoppers. BUT really you can't go wrong, everything is good and everything is cheap."}
{"text":"Babus employees have a fluctuating attitude.  The kothu roti is good however last time I called ahead to place an order (which I have always done since day one) I was told by a rude employee that I have to come in to order regardless of how many times before I have ordered ahead.  Being that he was rude and not at all interested in doing his job I decided to take my business elsewhere going forward. Not that it's going to hinder their sales so I highly doubt this review is going to really do much. 2 star for bad customer service since that's the only Ky competitive advantage left for companies these days.  Another place at Markham and Ellesmere is way better in terms of food and service will be going there from now on."}
{"text":"Toronto has about 300K sri lankans, ask any one where to get the best Sri Lankan food and you will be told to go to Babu. My family drives around 400 KM from Detroit to Toronto to buy food from Babu every few months. Here you can get authentic sri lankan dishes plus Indian, Malay etc but try the  crab dish (spicy and yummy) with string hoppers (Ask for Nandu, Iddiupam, Sothi and Sambol)."}
{"text":"I had the veg. thali.. the tomato curry and dhal were exceptional. Wasn't keen on the channa, but everything else was very good. I liked that it wasn't very spicy.. enough to give it good flavour but not enough to overpower. Not the cleanest restaurant..but good food!"}
{"text":"Very tasty curry chicken and vegetables. The portion is very good as well. I love the spiciness of their chicken curry. The pickled eggplants are excellent as well."}
{"text":"Great Naan, roti (wheat bread cooked with ghee[clarified butter]) & tandoori chicken. Roti comes with spicy coconut shredding in a separate plastic bag. It's recommended that you eat it with the roti but I usually don't. 

Buy naan from Babu and Chicken Makhani from Silver Spoon, which is right across the street. You will thank for it later :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Babu for more than 7 years now. I used to live in Scarborough and recently moved to Mississauga. I still drive about 45 minutes to get food from Babu. I highly recommend their snacks items, specially mutton roll, mutton samosa and vegi samosa. I also LOVE their veg and non veg thalis. Best of all you get a very good portion and the price is VERY reasonable."}
{"text":"I was told that I have not lived until I've eaten food from Babu's - WRONG!
The guy behind the counter was very nice and even gave me a meat samosa to try as I was curious if they were good. They were not bad but I prefer Indian/Pakistani style better. The Kottu Roti which came highly recommended to me was a huge disappointment. I don't think there was anything wrong with it per say, however as per most Tamil style food, It has way too many curry leaves in it. This gives a really overpowering taste (to me) and just turns me off the food altogether. I'm Indian from Mumbai (WEST COAST RULES!) so Im not anti curry leaves at all. Just too much for my taste. But if you like Tamil style food - you probably want to come to Babu's. They must be doing something right based on the line ups out the door!"}
{"text":"It's the best.  Love their Perogie rolls.  They come in fish, mutton, veggie.  THey are sooo good.  I love t hem way better than samosas!
They have an incredible selection of rices, vegetable curries and meat curres.  The food is always hot and fresh. There's a ton of people working there, and the line ups are always so long- but the smell, taste, experience is all worth it. And can't leave out how cheap it is!!! For $10- I can eat like a Queen!"}
{"text":"Yikes, the tikka masala chicken was undercooked, the green beans were bitter and the vegetable stew had been boiled to a mash. The service was great though and the workers there were really nice. I'm not sure if we went on the wrong day but myself, my best friend and my fiance couldn't eat our food."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Always packed . I am a regular customer of Babu since 2010 and always get amazed by their food quality, portion and low price. Really like their non veg thali and diff kinds of snacks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, both in price and the quality of food. My dad recently went to Sri Lanka and mentioned that the food he got from babu's is better than many of the places he ate at in Sri Lanka."}
{"text":"It was really decent food. I just wish the price point matched the food I was buying. If it was a bit cheaper then i would have given it another star"}
{"text":"It's not the best Sri Lankan/Indian restaurant out there but its definitely above average from the perspective of flavor and compared to most Sri Lankan/Indian fast food places, it has the most variety which makes me go there often. Also it's great value for money as usually dishes serve 2-3 people. Some of my favorites in recent times is their Singapore Noodles, Deviled Sea Food Curry, Mutton Rolls, Vadai, Chef Damu's Mutton Curry Special (and other Mutton/Goat specials), Naan and Roast Paan (Roast Bread). I've not had these myself but I do see many customers buying their teas and also enjoying their South Indian Breakfast Special (Breakfast Combo) which is great value for money. Babu is a good place for any non-Sri Lankan to get introduced to the Lankan and Tamil flavors without worrying too much and can simply pick and choose from what ever that looks pleasing to the eye. Their immense varieties of dishes and short-eats can add up to multiple trips to this place just to try them out. Also their long hours (5am - 12 am) helps a lot especially after a late night or if you want a quick early morning snack. Their customer service is mostly pleasant (there have been misses at times), but where they lack the most is their crowd management. Sometimes it can be confusing with where to stand and who you should be ordering and make the final payment to. Also navigating from one section of the store to the other can be challenging when the crowds are large, which is mostly the case. Nevertheless I would recommend this place which has become one of the staple places in Scarborough to get Sri Lankan/Tamil/Indian food. Try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is great on the pocket but spicy for the hot spicy lovers this is a great place.
Never had a better tasting SAMBAR anywhere in canada.
The morning combo is unbelievably inexpensive and stomach full.
Great variety of snacks. Noodles are awesome , just ask them to go light on the spices and its yummy and again only for less than 5 dollars."}
{"text":"I went here for the briyani and it was ok, not the best but not horrible either. What I do like about this place is their selection and their prices! The briyani was a little over $5 and was good enough for 2 meals, 3 if you dont eat too much.
Their curries and rotis look amazing and would be something I would go back for next time."}
{"text":"Both locations have superb food. Mutton and egg red onion curry are my favorite. Kutha roti is great as well. Staff is friendly and price is average.

Highly recommended if you like Tamil food."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Great service. The flavours will wake your taste buds. One of my favourite places for lunch."}
{"text":"The good thing about them is they close at midnight. Food was good, i wont say it was great but it was good for the money. I tried mutton biryani, chicken kerhaii and chicken tikka, their chicken kerhaii was very good and flavourful but biryani and tikka lacked a bit in flavour. But overall, it was good and id probably go there again if \"Silverspoon\"is closed"}
{"text":"Found this little gem by way of a work colleague who lives in the area. While service can lag at times it's worth the wait for great \"sweaty\" spicy and not so spicy hot plate items. The $5 lunch special can feed a king and the choices are plentiful both veggie and meat. An awesome find for a bit hindi from various regions."}
{"text":"Wow, if you like real-deal Indian food for cheap, please come here! Amazing selection, amazing pricing too. Always very busy even later on at night. Worth the wait tho! I've had everything from their eggplant, naan bread, butter chicken, chicken biryani, mutton rolls etc, always good!"}
{"text":"First time here...I was craving butter chicken and hubby checked yelp..its tucked away in a small strip plaza but easy enough to.find with free parking. Lots of variety and so cheap! We tried a meat lamprai which includes 1 meat Curry, a rice, and 5 veggie curries with an egg and some other sides wrapped in a banana leaf...for like 9.bucks this thing can feed 2...it weighed a ton! Try the eggplant dish! I wasn't sure what to pick so told the guy to pick his favourite and he told me the eggplant is the best recipe...he did not lie! 
I will return:)"}
{"text":"I give this place a...MEH.. review. I don't understand why folks below find it amazing. I just find everything way too greasy. But then again, South Asian food is always greasy. Maybe I didn't try the right dishes... It was just very... OK.

I think their saving grace was the sweets. I enjoyed their gulab jamun and jalebis. Oh and their samosa's too.

I'll definitely won't go back."}
{"text":"Pretty much everything there is cheap priced and tasty,the quality of the food is so-so(it's a little bit more on the oily side ) other than that, its one of the good places to try Srilankan food."}
{"text":"I've been to the babu on McCowan and Sheppard as well as the one on McCowan and BurOak both of which had amazing customer service. The food is delish super flavourful and lots of variety.
I got to pick 3 different curry choices and one rice. The samosas are smaller than samosa king and is 4 for 1 dollar, which isn't bad at all. But y'know that 5 for a dollar (;"}
{"text":"Huge portions and tasty curries! The staff is pretty helpful as well. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"FatCat get messages from Yelper asking like this. \"FatCaaat.. seeexxxy...  are your stories real baby?\".  

FatCat explain like this.. 

FatCat have recipe for writing reviews.  FatCat take 2 parts truth and 1 part fantasy, and he blend into nice thick smoothie - yummy!  FatCat then pour smoothie all over computer keyboard and wait for story to write itself..  Viola..  You now reading FatCat review. Sometimes FatCat add half spoon of speculation and small pinch of sarcasm to spice things up.  

Speaking of spice.. FatCat recently go to Babu..

Things FatCat like
 - Really delicious food for very cheap price..  But be careful..  everything very very spicy..  FatCat once make mistake of asking Mr Server \"what food have no spice in it Mr. Server??\"  FatCat have to wait 5 minutes for Mr. Server to stop laughing at FatCat before FatCat can order food.  Question not make sense to Mr. Server. Its like asking fish why he not want to live on land. Fish will think FatCat crazy too.

Thing FatCat not like
 - No place to sit. Take out only..."}
{"text":"Babu used to be great and now it's meh. We used to get it all the time when we were in the mood for spicy Sri Lankan food. We got it today for the first time in a long time and none of the items we ordered were spicy (or flavorful) at all. 

Overall we all found it pretty bland and not nearly as good as before. The one north Indian dish we ordered which we knew wouldnt be spicy was butter chicken but it was actually sweet which it isn't supposed to be. It was basically inedible. 

Approach with caution. Maybe Babu is a victim of its own success?"}
{"text":"Babu is the best for tamil foods! No matter what you buy, you would be intrigued with the tastes of pure Sri Lanka. No dinning in service available and believe this, this restaurant looks to have all male staff including the chefs. It just goes to say mother's cooking isn't always the best :p  

Highly recommended to everyone of different races, this is definitely a place to stop by to taste the best of Tamil food."}
{"text":"I love the Kothu Roti, even is so spicy for me, still couldn't stop it!  Lunch time, it has line up so many people, I waited about 20 mins to get my Roti."}
{"text":"Briyani with Tandoori chicken leg, hard boiled egg, a ton of rice, and a tiny side salad for $5.00 cash. (single size but is huge) I believe there is a family size as well. 

Fills me up every time and satisfying. (and I'm a big boy) Great cheaper alternative to your typical fast food joint. Their butter chicken (not dry!) and naan are also very delicious although will cost you closer to $10

Its located near the back of a very busy plaza. The line can get long but I've never had to wait longer than 10mins as it moves fast."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Sri Lankin/Indian take-out food. It's a bit chaotic inside but the staff are always willing to explain the different dishes available. Some of my favourites include chicken kothu rotti (ask for it spicy and it will taste like amazing fire) which is like a densely packed stir fry dish, the dosha which is a crepe-like shell wrapped with curry potatoes accompanied by curry dipping sauces, and most of their curries are delicious (chana, paneer, butter chicken, spicy chicken curry, etc). Plus their food is NOT oily. Some indian places have a icky layer of oil on their curries.

However, I do not like their Singapore style shrimp noodles which they claim are the best in the city (trust me, it's not, go to a Chinese-singapore place instead) and their string hoppers which are like blobs of sticky vermicelli noodles.

Babu is located in the back of a strip plaza in north east Scarborough and it's definitely worth a trip to try it."}
{"text":"Need to update this to 5 star, now that I know what to order (and more importantly what to avoid). Since this is a Tamil place, stick to the Tamil food. I no longer order the lamprais. Also I don't order much Indian food, except for their butter chicken. This is my favorite Sri Lankan place in Toronto and I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of the best Sri Lankan places in N America, especially when you consider the great prices. 

My go to orders are:

Mutton kotthu rotti. This is delicious, and so much food for the money. It's a little on the spicy side. Tip: order this before  you order the rest of the items as this takes longer to come out. 

Fish curry. This has grown on me. I really like the sauce in particular. This only comes in one size (2 pieces of fish) 

Mutton curry. This is tasty, but quite spicy

Butter chicken. Delicious as per  my prior  review

Short eats (eg wadais, patties, etc). Can't go wrong here. The items are either 3 or 4 for $1. Try not to go crazy though because a lot of this is fried. 

My wife loves naan so we used to order that too, but gave up because it takes too long to come out. 

The parking lot can get pretty crazy on weekends. Its busy, the spots are on the small side, and theres more than a few bad drivers. I try to park away from the crowd when possible to avoid the dings and possible accidents."}
{"text":"I'm afraid that while I am a fan of Babu, I'm not going to be quite as glowing as the others, only because I have been to Babu many times over the years, and I feel like it is not quite living up to its former reputation.
It's nice to see another renovation to enlarge the place, and a nice job they've done with it, too, plus they've also added a new Chef which they are proudly showing off in their front signage (see below), but sadly someone has to pay for these Renovations and their new chef, so prices have bumped up fairly dramatically over time.
The samosas and patties are still very good and very inexpensive, and all of the food is really quite delicious, but the prices now are creeping further and further northward, see the tooth very small containers, one of Chilli Chicken, and one of a chicken tikka, that were $5 bucks each for a very, VERY small portion.
Maybe I've become spoiled by all of the amazing Asian restaurants in Scarborough, Markham, and Richmond Hill, who seem to serve up HUGE containers of food for around $5 or $6 bucks, but it now feels like like I am not getting very much mileage for my money, when compared to not very long ago.
This was once a place with amazing food and amazing value, now food is still great value has just slipped from what it once was.
Babu is still a great place to get real Sri Lankan Tamil food, including amazing samosas  both meat and vegetarian, very cheap as well as some of the most flame-throwingly Hot dishes you can imagine, and the service is quick and very friendly, even if you are a rookie and don't know what you're doing.
Still love the place, but would like to see the portions get a little bigger, especially on the meat dishes."}
{"text":"I probably go here every week. Sometimes just for snacks and appetizers, other times for take out meals. Cheap and super tasty. Quick snack: fish bun $1, fish patties 3/$1, roti $0.50/1.00. Meals: seafood or chicken with 3 choices of veggie sides about $6-7. This meal is good enough for two!!!"}
{"text":"The chicken in the Butter Chicken was cold!!! I do not mean room temperature like it was left out but it was actually cold! I've had many butter chickens before but never bit into one that was cold. This time the naan was hot and fresh.

Been here 3 times, first time the naan was cold and now the butter chicken was cold. Something about the ordering experience here doesn't feel good. Can't put my finger on it...

I think I have given this place enough tries will not be returning."}
{"text":"Perfect place for all the takeout. Opens till late and gets super busy during the weekends. Have been visiting there since years and has always been good. Tale out at large quantities for parties is always the best option here."}
{"text":"Amazing food for its price! 

Eelam Tamil run, since there forever.
Try their Briyani with tandoori chicken leg and ask for chilly chicken with the dish. its about $8 but it can feed four people!

Pros:
-a lot of variety
-PRICE$$$
-brings the blend of tamil

Cons:
-parking
-the line up setup is a little weird
- always busy"}
{"text":"I'd say its my go-to spot for kothu roti! The mutton kothu roti is a hit or miss but you need to try the chilli chicken kothu roti, spicy and gravy"}
{"text":"Shit food. I order 600 dollars worth of food for my daughter's birthday party. And the food was so GARBAGE.  We had to throw almost all food in the garbage.  Mutton curry was so shit. It tasted like beef. I think they mixed two meet inside. Pittu mix was so nasty. It was so watery. Egg plant was so sweet. Totally waste of money. I used to love babu catering food before. But now they got the business. So they dont care no more. NEVER AGAIN I WILL GO THERE"}
{"text":"The variety & the taste of food is so good that Babu is a favorite for many people like myself. Even on a weekday afternoon, it's hard to find parking spaces. I travel from Oakville to get their food. Their mutton  roast is the best I'd ever tasted."}
{"text":"I went to Babu recently with my parents.  We bought several bags of food and it cost us less than $30.  This place is take out only.  There is no place to sit.  If you have ever been to Samosa King (the take out part, not the restaurant part), Babu is similar.

We went a little before 3:00pm on a weekday and it was starting to get busy.  The staff are incredibly nice.  They answered all our questions and even gave us generous samples.

The vegetable samosas here are 5 for $1 just like at Samosa King.  However, their meat samosas (mutton) are also 5 for $1 (where at Samosa King the meat samosas (chicken) are 2 for $1).  The samosas at Babu are flatter and the pastry is different than most other samosas.  The filling is also different, it is pureed, so the filling tastes like mash potatoes (vegetarian) and mutton-infused mashed potatoes (meat).  It is a very different taste than other samosas that I've had where the filling is little cubes of potatoes +/- meat.  The samosas are tasty and full of flavour, but I think that I prefer non-pureed fillings for samosas.

They had lots of \"short eats\" like mutton rolls, bondas, vadas, fish cutlets, etc.  Mutton Rolls are $1 each.  They are stuffed with curried potatoes and mutton.  I liked them, but I prefer the ones at Samosa King as those are meatier and cheaper (only $0.75).  Although the ones at Babu are spicier.  Fish Patices are 3 for $1 and are little deep-fried half-moon pastries stuffed with pureed potatoes and fish.  They have a mild fish flavour.  We also got a Chicken Roti Roll ($2.95).  It's chicken, boiled egg and spices wrapped in a roti and then pan fried.  It's huge, I could eat one for lunch and be full.  I really liked this, but there was a huge piece of whole ginger the size of a jujube in the roll and also a whole garlic clove.  I would have liked it better if these were chopped up a bit more.

We also got some milk hoppers ($1 each).  It's like a sourdough crepe with a milky centre.  Interesting, but not my cup of tea.  However, my mom loved it.  My mom also got a small order of Red Pittu ($1.95).  It's like a rice-based couscous with shredded coconut on top.  Then they give you a bag of dried shredded coconut mixed with chili and butter that you are supposed to mix into the pittu, I suppose.  The mix is hot (spicy) and sour and very unusual.  Again, interesting, but not my cup of tea either.  Again, my mom loved this.

We got an order of Chicken Kottu Roti ($6.95).  It was very spicy, you could see many pieces of green chili peppers throughout.  It also contained a lot of onions.  I personally prefer the Chicken Kottu Roti at Samosa King since theirs has less onions and is only ($3.99).  We also got their \"All Day Lunch Special\" which is steamed rice, 1 meat curry and 3 vegetable curries for $4.99.  We got the Beef Madras (big tender chunks of lean beef in a deliciously spicy sauce), peas curry (spicy curry sauce), green beans curry (sweet and spicy sauce), and a potato curry (spicy curry sauce).  Overall good, but very spicy.  Samosa King has a similarly priced special but they also give you a huge piece of naan bread and a gulab jamun.  

The food here is much spicier than at Samosa King.  They are generally more expensive than Samosa King.  However, they have items that Samosa King doesn't such as Milk Hoppers, Pittu, Roti Rolls and Fish Cutlets.   

Sorry for all the Samosa King comparisons, but the places are very similar in my opinion, so I can't help but make comparisons.  Babu is great in its own right (hence the 4 star rating).  However, I personally prefer Samosa King because the prices are cheaper there and the food is comparable or better.  But Babu has more selection and their food is spicier, so I would come to Babu for items that Samosa King doesn't have or if I'm craving some really hot and spicy food."}
{"text":"I've been going to babu for years! I can't get over how delicious it all is. I love the veggie dishes and the fresh naan! Thank you babu!!! Veggie Thali all the way!"}
{"text":"So yummy! The ready made rotis are cheap and delicious at $3 a piece and though I've heard the samosas used to be better, I still love the ones they have now at 4/$1. Love this place."}
{"text":"Sri Lanka or more accurately Tamil. This place is totally legit! As a white guy from the states, I'm totally not used to this food but was blown away by how good it was. Tons of veggie options, curries, baked goods (meat pies etc) and dried foods. Def. my new go to place for Sri Lanka food and super cheap $5 for a meal that's probably two meals. Beware: take out only. No seating. And although they try to be as helpful as possible to a white dude like me (thank you babu!) not too many workers there speak English. Still well worth it!"}
{"text":"Stopped here a few times, I really like this place, there is a bit of a language barrier, but every server I have ever had is very good at explaining the items on display.
Every time we go, we have the butter chicken, and naan, other than that we just pick whatever looks good. 
Last time there, I had a really good wrap, it was a naan (fresh made bread from the tandoori oven) wrapped around a beef kabob, soooo good. 

Great place, there are no seats at all, but they do great takeout, and they are open late."}
{"text":"Unsatisfied with the level of customer service. It takes quite some time to get someone's attention to place your order. Seems that staff are too busy focusing on other duties."}
{"text":"Chicken biriyani or mutton biriyani for $5.45, pretty good deal. I came an hour before closing and unfortunately they didn't have chicken biriyani, decided to go with mutton. Added one naan for $1.25

Naan was very soft, and massive wow! Mutton was nicely spiced, tasty. Also came with a small container of yogurt chutney with sliced onions and cucumbers inside. Came home and made a salad to go with my meal."}
{"text":"I was partial to Pakistani chicken biryani. But I've eaten Sri Lankan chicken Biryani three days consecutively. I love the spiciness hot taste. I think I will be ordering Sri Lankan chicken Biryani more often when the cravings demand. 

Oh my my, just finished eating, my sinuses are clear and I am still wiping my dripping nose, lovely heat from this food.
It is spicy, hot and enticingly flavourful. Here are some of the ingredients that are the norm: cardamom pods, Red and green Chilli, Turmeric, Coriander leaves, mint leaves, Kesari powder, ginger, garlic, Tomatoes, Bay leaf, cinnamon and etc. depending on the cook."}
{"text":"Now that I have been to Babu's a few times I'm ready to put in my two cent. Or should I say a Nicole ;-). 

I have had Kothu Roti (chicken and beef). Pretty hefty serving for 7 bucks. Last night I tried Beef Masala, noon and a Mutton Role. Food is tasty. Service is pretty decent. Just be prepared to wait a bit if they are busy. 

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel like something is missing. As soon as I put my finger on it, I'll post an update."}
{"text":"Honestly the meat thali combo is insane!  Variety, authentic, flavourful, badass and cheap!  If your craving Indian food then this is definitely the place for take out.  Lines get busy but after tasting babu you'll know why.  
As well I enjoy how authentic  it feels inside, not American iced lol."}
{"text":"Lunch combo: super cheap compared to anywhere I've eaten. Mutton curry with dark rice, rice is the best thing on the plate, mutton tasted stale and harder to the bite than standard. Naan, nothing to rave about. Curry had a good texture but it seemed as if it was overcooked and very chunky and not left in the meat enough. Meat had darker colors of where it was left sitting 

7$ is great for the price if you're only getting rice. veggies in the rice are also canned which is gross with those veggies inside"}
{"text":"After reading so much about them, I gave them a try. The place is only for take out and I had to wait in line for 30 minutes on a weekday evening.

I tried the mutton Kothu, and I guess I am not a big fan of Kothu as it was the first time me trying it. I did not like the soggy texture of the fried flat bread(Paratha) mixed with so many ingredients. I did not expect that pasta like texture. My guess is it is supposed to be like that. The taste was very good though. 

I am giving them a 4 star because I tried their Dosa and trust me, it was really good. The crunch of the dosa paired with the flavourful potato filling was superb. I will go back to this shop again only for their Dosa. 

If like the texture of the Kothu in general I think theirs should be tried."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Babu is my go-to place for cheap tasty Indian food. I've been here so many times for their lunch combo w/ chili chicken. Their chicken roti is quite good as well; it's stuffed w/ chicken, potatoes, and egg for only 3 bucks. 

Too bad they don't have seating; takeout only. And there's usually a line up but it moves fairly quickly."}
{"text":"This takeout restaurant serves bakery products, Sri Lankan desserts, Sri Lankan food, snacks, Sri Lankan style Indian and Chinese food all under one roof. You won't be disappointed with the selection, although I find some snacks to be extremely greasy and intolerably spicy. Their roti was also a little too hard and thick for my liking. 

I believe one of my curried dishes was floating in oil, and when I pointed it out to my friend, it immediately became a product of a dare. 
If you're in the mood for a drinking game, head out to Babu and drink every time you see oil. 

Yes, it's cheap food but does that really warrant a trip to the hospital?"}
{"text":"I've probably heard about this place countless times and have probably even eaten takeout from here at countless family gatherings, but since I've had occasion to actually make the trek out to Scarborough myself recently, I thought it only proper to write a review for what has now become a Scarborough institution and arguably one of the most important ethnic eateries in the GTA.

One of the first things you will note about the sign of this establishment is that Babu serves the food of Tamil Eelam (not Sri Lanka) and this is because the restaurant has long been a support of the Tamil separatist struggle and is rumoured to have even been funded by the LTTE.  One glance behind the counter and it is evident that the Tigers' organizational acumen is at work in a well-oiled machine that cranks out high volumes of tasty food at ridiculous low prices (why would one even bother to cook when such delicious fare can be obtained at such absurdly low prices?).

I took my friend who was visiting from out of the town, and she'd seen her share of Indian takeout in Chicago, but even she was impressed by the diversity and spicyness (key!) of the food at Babu's.  On weekends, they offer this delicious seafood soup called \"kool\" that is known to work wonders on colds.  My favorite is the spicy mutton curry (you have to ask for this, since most of their non-spicy stuff is on display on the front, and their good stuff is at the back).  You gotta make it a point to get the kotthu roti, but I personally prefer the idiyappam kothu w/ mutton.  This basically involves taking the string hopper and chopping it up as you would a kothu, except mixing it with the standard kothu ingredients.  Soft and oh-so-good!  I'm also a big fan of the lamprais (a Dutch-influenced creation) that involves a massive portion of rice and varies curries wrapped in a banana leaf.  This one meal (which you can obtain for $7 or so) will easily grant you THREE full meals.

I've been quite impressed with both the last two takeout orders from Babu's.  They weren't overly greasy and the meat didn't have too much fat.  I would seriously consider making future weekend trips to stock up on food for the week.  Great to have some kothu in the freezer for those drunken nights out."}
{"text":"Be still my heart Babu!  I've eaten samosas from here from forever!  Everyone at work gets them from Babu's or Samosa King.

I've always heard about Babu's magical lunch specials...so cheap for the amount of food you get.  I had to finally check it out.

Babu's is located in a strip plaza (it's at the end of the line of stores).  You can't miss it (just let your nose lead the way).  also, you might want to leave your jacket in the car

Anyways..this place practically every type of curry that you could want, mutton, fish, lamb, several ric dishes, biryani, veggie options, apps, desserts....it's so...much....food.

I got the king fish curry and the biryani lunch special (1 meat choice, 2 side choices with biryani).  My entire order with taxes came up to $14.  There was enough food to feed a family of 4.  But since it's just me, myself and I...that food lasted me for lunch and dinner over 2 nights.  So 4 meals for $14...............who can beat that???????!   

The food was delicious - it's not the best - you can't compare a sit down restaurant to this place as of course they make their food in large batches - you will always lose something in the quality.  But the spice level doesn't suffer and for less than $8 (there were many options for under $8 and some lunch combos were $5) you just can't go wrong.

Babu's is all right with me :)"}
{"text":"Went here because of all these beautiful stars that my fellow Elite members posted up. The service was fast and easy. The place smelled so good and the food was amazing. 

I got the Butter chicken with Naan and the price was less than expected. They top up the foam container to the top for the butter chicken and the naan is HUGE! 
I'm no Indian, but this is really really good curry. The spices and the flavor just seep out from the container. I would absolutely try it again!"}
{"text":"Awesome ,tasty and cheap food.highly recommended.breakfast combo daily only for $3.50 2 dosa,2idly,2vada and coffee enough r for 2 people"}
{"text":"Omg I don't think I've ever been served a bigger thali of food than this! 

Okay so the place carries a wide selection of dishes and some sweet too, but I forgot to check out the sweets :( But with all the variety of dishes going on, it hard to see everything. So after like 30 mins of deciding what to get, I decided to go with a thali filled with 5 veggie curries, fried rice and shrimp curry served on banana leaf! Sounds so filling and yum, but little did I know that they would also serve me fired fish and an omelette on top of that. Wow it was like a mountain of food and is probably more than what a eat in a day. As for the taste, the curries were good and their tamarind eggplant was just soooooooo good. My friend doesn't even like eggplant but will eat this eggplant dish any day. Thst dish is really good. 

The other veggie curries were good, and the shrimp curry had some other fish in it too. They are definitely generous with how they serve. And wrapping it in a banana leaf was cute too. 

But the problem is that this is just for takeout. I wanted to sit and eat, but they don't have seats. Hmmmm, otherwise it's awesome :)"}
{"text":"My favourite Tamil Take out place. Best variety, and cheap. Can get really busy, and a little bit pricier than other Tamil take out places, but great taste you really can't beat.
Just wish they didn't change the fish patties (patty pastry)."}
{"text":"This review is only for the sweets, but they were super sweet, fresh and creamy, just the way I like my palm sugar sweets. Judging from the other reviews, I should have made some room for some food. The clientele was all Sri Lankan, which was a good sign!"}
{"text":"First time here with my girlfriend and we were really disappointed. Although the prices were good for the portions, the food wasn't satisfying at all. The freshly cooked chicken biryani tasted like wet slop and was unlike any other biryani I've had. The chicken tikka Marsala lacked flavour, it tasted like tomato sauce with franks hot sauce added to it, not to mention the side of rice cold. Lastly, the veggie pakoras were hard as rocks. Swear my teeth were going to chip off after eating a few. 

My advice? If you want authentic south Asian food do not go here. But if you're drunk and want some cheap eats, it's open 5am-12am"}
{"text":"Good quality, great price points and very tasty. Huge homemade Nans and the food is very spicy. We live in Oshawa and can't find good quality Indian  food in Durham region so we pick up Babu's on the way back home.
Markham location is also very good."}
{"text":"If you want cheap and fast and not bad quality this is the place it's good don't get me wrong not the best but for the price its amazing"}
{"text":"The mutton kothu roti is to die for.

My husband and I eat here 3-4 times a month. The food is great and the prices are even better!"}
{"text":"Good place to get srilankan food and take out if your in a hurry. My favourite snack food is the mutton rolls and fish bun"}
{"text":"Their kottu roti was really good and worth the price. But every other dish was really spicy. I think ordering the 3 chillies marked ones were a mistake. Mutton curry wasn't great but the prawns curry was good"}
{"text":"Been here 2 times already and every time I go here its always has a line up. Take out only. Service is fast even when the line is long. Most of the food is displayed for you to see so you have an idea what you are ordering. Tried the Chettinad Chicken which was spicy but bearable and tasted very good. It has so much different flavors which is hard to describe. You just gotta try it and get it with naan. Got it with 1 naan bread the first time but mental note for self: Need 2 naans for future purchase as one was just not enough for all the sauce and meat they give you on a medium size order.

On the 2nd visit I tried the butter chicken with 2 naans, and a tandoori chicken leg ($3) Neither of these were that good. The butter chicken lacked the rich buttery flavor that I'm use to from other Indian restaurants and the chicken leg was just seasoned the way I like. It looked too good to pass but after trying it once I don't think I will ever order the chicken leg again."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious and inexpensive take out.

There is a wide range of Indian food available here. I'd suggest sticking to the south Indian menu.

The mutton rolls are the best here. So are biriyanis and the curries."}
{"text":"It may be a bit out of the way, and it might have a long long long line, but trust me... it's worth it. Babu's brings you the flavour and spice of South Asian food without a plane ticket. This is a take out only location that has enough selection to warp your brain. 

The Kothu Roti is highly recommended and made fresh to order. It's easily the best I've ever tried. While you're there, pick up some Mutton Roles as they're always a tasty addition. Just be ready to wait a bit if you're coming around dinner time, as the lines can get a bit crazy."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been getting food here for so many years. Food has always been great. The staff is good at letting you know what's in the food. The portions are good for the price, quality is on point. There can be a line up because lots of people know of this gem but it's worth the little line up. 110% worth it. If you like Indian food & are in the east end you have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Best milk Hoppas I have tasted! And I have tried a lot, these are always fresh and poked perfectly (crispy test moist in the centre). I would say their even better than the ones I have tasted in Sri Lanka.

Its a takeout only, my family usually gets party appetizers here like Samosas, Vadai (Ulundu, Channa), Rolls etc. Most of them cost about 5pieces/$1."}
{"text":"Wide selections available. Authentic taste. Worth the price. Especially like their pepper chicken and lemon rice! It is a nice take away dinner option."}
{"text":"I pick up fresh naan from Babu's all the time, their freshly made naan from the tandoor is delicious."}
{"text":"great price, food was good in the beginning but the quality has gone down and im not talking about taste, im talking about food grade."}
{"text":"Just finished a lunch takeout from Babus in Scar. and it was awesome! I The food is seriously spicy but in a very good way. I love Kothu Roti and was surprised when I searched for it that it actually came up in reviews. We ordered the following:
Beef Kothu
2 Chicken Tandoori Pieces
1 King Fish Fry
1 small order of Saag(Spinach)
2 Seekh Kababs
4 Naans 
3 drinks

and it was more than enough for 3 people all under $30. 

The food was great, really fresh and authentic tasting. Best Kothu ive ever had in take out for sure. 

PS. If you are wondering what Kothu is its basically stir fried shreaded paratha with spices, onions, green chilis, choice of eggs, meat or veggies."}
{"text":"Good food at an amazing price!

Getting my food was a very confusing experience and it was really chaotic in there. I ordered the vegetable thali, received a huge sack of food and was concerned that I had actually ordered a family sized meal or something. It cost $7.95 and is at least two meals worth of food for someone who's hungry. Quality and quantity of the food is very good for the price.

No seating, FYI."}
{"text":"Babu is probably the best known and one of the first of the Sri Lankan take out places to really catch on in the GTA.  Normally we go to one in Markham but I was in the area and decided to stop in for snack at this original location in Scarborough.

Babu serves a variety of Sri Lankan and Indian dishes such as curries, briyanis, dosas, samosas, etc with the flavouring more Sri Lankan in nature on the hotter side.

All the food is already pre-cooked in the hot tables but certain items need to be ordered and made fresh such as the dosas and naans.  They also sell a variety of baked and fried items as well.

If you are not sure what to get, a good item to order is the lunch special.  $5.95 for the meat option gives 1 meat choice, 3 veggie choice over a huge mound of rice (brown or white, or fried).  They really pack it in and is a great deal for big eaters like me!  Some stand outs are the butter chicken, beef curry and chicken briyani.

The only bad thing is the ordering system can get confusing when it gets crowded as you line up, get someone to do all you selections, get a numbered ticket and then pay to receive your order.  Workers are generally very nice but again gets hectic when busy as they all over the place.

3.5/5 for some good Sri Lankan eats!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Babus, seriously.  Excellent curries (vegetarian options as well), gorgeous curry crab, mutton, chicken ... amazing short eats (love the fish patties and the vadai - you can't just stop at one!).  Try the sugar bun for a carbo-licious treat ... the parathas here are also tried and true delicious.  What can I say ... Babus never disappoints!"}
{"text":"The venture into this plaza during the weekend is truly a horror. There was literally a line up by car to get into the plaza from Sheppard Avenue. Once we finally got our car into the plaza, the hunt for a spot was on. It's such a very small parking lot that doesn't allow for good traffic flow. There are two entrances/exits which can help with overcoming this, also try searching for parking in the back side where the shipping/receiving trucks hang around.

This place is strictly for takeout only, so don't expect to eat your meal right away. We got in and noticed there was a steady lineup for food. Kind of confusing how to order if you're not a regular though. Waiting in line we saw lots of buffet tray warmers where they have their sauces, curries and stuff...but I could not tell what each one was. I wish there were signs. And looking up at the menu boards I noticed these were really old and did not clearly show prices of their menu items.

The much talked about kothu roti (7$) was mediocre in my opinion. It was my first time trying this dish. To me, it did not look aesthetically appetizing, but it did smell really nice. Had a bowl of this and there was not much meat...instead I found myself crunching on cartilage every now and then. It totally ruined the meal for me. And it's not like I could have picked out the cartilage pieces...everything was haphazardly chopped up into small bits. The butter chicken was pretty good, tangy and buttery, but it was disappointing portion-wise, it was in a much smaller container (small styrofoam takeaway bowl), also for $7."}
{"text":"Getting to Babu Catering required a 1.5 hour TTC adventure from downtown Toronto to a nondescript strip mall in the furthest reaches of Scarborough. Despite this mission I'd happily go back again right now; it's that good.

As soon as I walked in the door of Babu with my fellow adventurers we knew this was the real deal. The small, takeout only restaurant was completely packed with customers -- almost all of them Sri Lankan -- and the flow didn't stop for the entire time we were there. At least a dozen staff worked furiously behind the counter serving customers and preparing the delicious looking food on offer. The distinctive clanking sound of kothu roti being chopped up on the griddle filled the air.

The menu is quite large with North Indian, South Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, Hakka, and Sri Lankan options. Many of the curries are on display in warming trays, which makes deciding a lot easier. Other items are made to order. Vegetarian options are plentiful and excellent.

We ordered a bunch of dishes to share amongst our group. The Vegetarian Kothu Roti ($5.95) -- classic Sri Lankan fast food consisting of vegetables, roti, and spices chopped up and fried -- was the highlight of the meal.

The Hoppers are delicious bowl shaped rice flour pancakes that come plain ($.075) or with coconut milk ($1) or an egg ($1.45) in the centre.

The Vegetarian Lumprie ($6.95), while not my favourite dish, is certainly worth getting just for the experience. A heap of rice is placed on a banana leaf followed by half a dozen different vegetarian curries including mutter paneer, mushroom curry, eggplant curry, and others. The whole thing is wrapped up tight in the banana leaf and warmed up. The end result is a package or rice and curry that probably weighs 2 kilograms; it's enough food to feed five people. Although good, this was probably my least favourite dish. Some of the meat eaters in our group raved about the mutton version of this dish.

We also tried a few of the curries all of which were amazing. The naan ($1.25) was decent but I don't think it was super fresh and I have had better.

Surprisingly, none of the dishes were overly spicy. We came expecting to have our faces burned off but most dishes were actually fairly mild.

Our entire bill came to $42 including drinks. A total steal for enough delicious food to feed a small army.

Babu is takeout only but there are some grassy spots near the sidewalk. We brought our own plates and cutlery and had a picnic."}
{"text":"Affordable and good quality food. They have vegetarian options cabbage and mix veg good. Don't try channa. Not upto standard."}
{"text":"\"Would you like a coma with that lamprais? \"
\"Why yes, yes please! \"

WARNING: LAMPRAIS IS NOT FOR THE FAINT HEARTED NON LOVING SPICY FOODSTERS. THIS DISH REQUIRES A PARTNER TO DEBATE WITH ON WHO GETS TO EAT THE EGG! Ofcourse I did!

Not quite sure who could possibly execute the banana leaf dish like my Filipino people but BABU sure did fire up the 'next level' to the next.

If you're not familiar with what I'm talking about, back home we have a way to feast on local delicacies laid out on a long stretch of banana leaves for 'plates', and use hands instead of utensils. 

Yeah yeah gross, yuck whatever!! You get a spot on the damn leaf, don't stray double dipping in someone else's territory and your cooties remains yours and yours only! 

We call it 'kamayan' (eating with hands) and it's taken TORONTO by storm as it became popular  recently during birthdays and get-togethers. 
Even Filipino restaurants cater to this kamayan themed events for everyone to experience getting in touch with their inner caveman. HINT HINT: resto Lamesa delivers the experience in fine dining style.

BABU had their  'TO-GO'  version with a choice of chicken, beef or veggie with 5 sides of your choice (hardest decisions ever made on a Monday 11am might I add). 

Comes with 1 hard boiled egg, choice of white or brown rice with the baddest sauce and spices combined wrapped in the glorious banana leaf, heated and then wrapped to go. BOOM!!

You insult the GODS OF LAMPRAIS if you dare eat with the fork but hubby and I had no choice. We suffered from a mild coma as we indulged in every bite while the car windows fogged up, even my portion control awareness was impaired and FOGGED UP because of all the different flavours!!!

We probably looked like a pair of famished savages ripping the chicken masala apart amidst the pickled eggplant dish, lentils, dried/fried anchovies, cabbage dish, potatoes, zucchini and chickpeas!!!

$9 for all this and we still had leftovers!! 

I see a repeat in the near future!

ISTUTIY BABU!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my bro cause he swore that this is one of the best Indian take out places in the city - though really, it's deep in Scarborough and not sure how get there by TTC. Anyway, when got there the line was huge (a plus for me - must be good, right?) So we got in line and I tried to read the menu as we moved forward. Unfortunately I just couldn't see the whole menu. The space is huge and the menu is spread across the entire back wall. Needless to say, I stuck to what I knew: butter chicken, chicken tikka and crab curry. I also ordered bhatura. The bhatura they forgot about, so I had to wait over 20 minutes for it (they said it would take 5 to make), and the space is so hectic, that it gets confusing to know what order is being filled at what time. When I got home I checked my bag, and I did get everything that I ordered. Though the smart thing to do would have been to check my bag there! Duh. 

Overall, decent food and experience, tons of food options, and value for money. 

Would I make the trek back to Scarbaria for it? Nah."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Babu's Scarborough location. I had previously taken food out from their newer Markham store and was impressed by the taste. Let me start by saying I am not Tamil or even South-Asian for that matter. I am a Caucasian Canadian guy who just enjoys the complex and spicy flavours of Sri Lankan food. This evening I decided to take a trip down Sheppard to try the original Babu location. Upon entering the store was obviously busy being that it was Saturday night. I stood in line for about 10 minutes and when my turn came (not before I was disregarded for family of Tamil patrons) I ordered a medium sized Chettynadu mutton and a medium size eggplant pickle (a very common Sri Lankan dish). Upon reaching the register my total came to almost $20 (which seemed abnormally high). I figured the individual dishes are more expensive than the thali/combo plates and paid up. Upon seeing my receipt it appears they charge you double the cost of the small for a medium container and triple for a large. The containers increase in size by perhaps 40-50% as you go up to medium and large. While they pack the containers full, the quantity of food for the price doesn't seem like such a good value compared to their combo deals. I suspect they overcharged me as they knew I wasn't a regular nor would I know how much the food should actually be. After all, they don't show prices for most of the hot food. Taste-wise, I enjoyed my two dishes which were both packed with flavour and had a good level of heat (Sri Lankan food is supposed to be hot). Quality-wise, the mutton was slightly fatty which may be the way it's meant to be in order to stay moist and flavourful. The one issue I have with their food is the temperature of the serving dishes. They don't keep the food at a temperature I feel is safe. Both my dishes arrived home cold despite being transported 15 minutes home in a warm car. The eggplant which came out about 2 minutes before I ordered it was not even steaming which made me question the freshness. Food temperature is very important (although some may argue the level of heat used in South Asian cooking was meant to preserve the food when refrigeration wasn't available). 

If you like Indian food and enjoy dishes with complex spicy flavours give Sri Lankan food a try."}
{"text":"There is a lot of variety in curries at this restaurant. It is definitely a walk-in place, don't expect to sit down and eat here. 

I have the butter chicken and the chicken tikka masala, the meat Samosa and the veggie Samosa, and garlic naan.

I wouldn't recommend the samosas. They're 4 for $1 and they were on the spicy side but not very tasty and the pastry was dry and stiff.

The garlic naan was good at $2.25.

The chicken tikka masala didn't really taste like your prototype chicken tikka masala, the butter chicken was good and the chicken was very tender.

The serving is only enough for one person and maybe two if you don't eat alot.

They take credit card, debit and cash.

*They state that all the meat is halal including the Samosas.

There's always a long line inside but to be honest I don't think it's all that spectacular"}
{"text":"Actual rating 3.5.

Thank the gods my friend had been there before numerous times and could successfully decode the menu because it confused the hell out of me!  And keep in mind I am used to King's Palace.

This place is insanely cheap.  We walked away with enough take out to feed a small army for $33!!!

The food was tasty but did mad weird things to my stomach that night after eating it and even more so the next day.  It wasn't just that it was hot; spice is fine by me.  It wasn't that it was overly greasy either because it wasn't unreasonably so.  Still, something rocked my gut.  Upon investigation and discussion with fellow foodie friends, I hear I am not alone in my tummy troubles after Babu.

I may give it a second try, but I wouldn't stray too far from a loo if I did!"}
{"text":"Amazing Kothu Roti. The dishes are well portioned, spicy and very delicious. For the price you are getting so much food. You can defiantly share one plate for Kothu Roti and still be full. I had the chicken and beef kothu roti, and both are great.

Just note, the store is a bit cramped and sometimes it can take a while for the line to move, but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Need to improve how your lines are organized and the way people are served. I been waiting for 10 minutes at the take out line and not seen a single person being served properly. You also have people moving up and picking up phone orders randomly. Either you have a line or you indicate people pick up their take out orders randomly. Please add signs and organize your serving mechanisms. I used to admire how you had everything organized and how elegantly people were served. There seems to be a lot of new people and no organization whatsoever is. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"A lot of food for a really good price, $5 for the lunch special. Kottu Roti with extra curry is a must try, as well as the biryani with chili chicken"}
{"text":"The naan here is delicious. 

It's a take-out joint where they try to mix in some \"Chinese dishes\" occasionally. Their Chinese dishes tend to be salty...and not very good. The rest of food, with its dishes changing frequently tend to be pretty decent. Full disclosure: some of their offerings (re: a lot) may be a bit oily, but that shouldn't scare you from devouring their food. Remember, fat is what makes food taste good. 

It's cheap and it's good. I usually get 3-4 dishes and rice for around $20. 

Right across the [plaza] street is the Silver Spoon, but that place always appears to be empty. 

Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Cheap and delish. Babu is a popular spot when we're looking for something quick and easy. The south Indian cuisine is a nice mix of spicy and hot. I would stay away from their chicken tandoori as it was always dry and overpriced for one piece. Everything else is good to go. I highly recommend the lunch special which is $7 for 1 meat and 3 vegetable dishes with white or egg fried rice."}
{"text":"I went to Babu yesterday after hearing all the great reviews about this place. It was packed with a huge line-up around 6 pm on a Thursday night. There was no place to sit as they only offer take-out but I enjoyed watching the whole team of chefs, servers and who I think was the owner, work in great unison. For under $20 we got more than enough food to serve a party of 6. Everything was delicious. Even though they seemed very busy and are probably tired from the gap of just 4 hours that they are closed everyday - 90% of the staff seemed upbeat and very helpful and friendly. I will definitely return to this place even though it's over an hour away as it is totally worth it!"}
{"text":"OK Babu! Are you trying to stuff me and make me so fat??!!

I am just trying to have something for lunch.. and for $4.50 My takeout box was packed to the max with all these spiciness goodness that I cannot stop myself from eating! 

Yes the curry is spicy! Trust me if I said it is spicy, it is spicy!!

I would definitely be back for some quick, cheap, spicy spicy food!"}
{"text":"Mutton Kothu Roti. Go and try for yourself. Enough said. 

I used to work with some Sri Lankan guys who ate kothu roti all the time during the night shift. Babu Brings me back to those days - authentic, delicious and flavourful south Asian cuisine with a focus on Sri Lankan. The string hopper is worth it as well - as are the curries. Prices can't be beat. The lineup is constant - people can't stop coming back for these eats. Get here now!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want some quick Sri Lankan dishes. Prices are great. Quality is good. Food is delicious. 

Come early if you want to have more choices. As the day goes they run out of all the good food. 

Dish to try: Mutton Kotthu Rotti."}
{"text":"I'm not very good with spicy food, but Babu is so good that I don't even care. It is oilier than I would have liked, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

The prices here are pretty average (although some items are very cheap). The service is slightly lacking, but since it's a fast paced take out place, it doesn't matter too much. My only real complaint is that the naan takes too long to come out. My solution is that I just don't order it anymore, but if you're willing to wait, then it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Great food with arrogant attitude....of the Tamil food places, I would say its one of the best for food, but the others are so much friendlier and helpful...."}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered Babu I've been back to order their patties, samosas, roti and rolls several times. It's just so tasty (but oh so bad for me, I'm attracted to all their deep fried offerings). Their fish patties and mutton patties are yummy (3 for $1). I tried the veggie one but unless you're a vegetarian you can give these a pass. I recently ordered their chicken roti and I would definitely order that one again ($2 or $3, I can't remember). I also bought just their plain roti ($1.00) and put it in the toaster oven for a few minutes to crisp up the outside. 

The guys at the counter are efficient and have been patient even when I'm asking them about the items I'm curious about. It's a great place to pick up some quick finger foods to munch on or bring to a party."}
