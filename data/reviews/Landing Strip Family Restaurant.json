{"text":"Clean ! Here for breakfast and very pleased with the food the people and the restaurant. Drivers passing by will not be disappointed coming off the highway and making this stop. Home style cooking and wonderful people."}
{"text":"Family-style place close to the highway. Good food good service at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We didn't know what to expect when we arrived at the Landing Strip, especially because our preference is fully-shaved. We were going to go for the full BRAZILIAN bbq place, but when it comes to different styles of eating out, Landing Strip was the one. 

The climax, of course, was the amazing chicken fingers. My friend was really pleased with her tossed salad. 

Highly recommended.  We licked our plates clean."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick stop between NJ and Niagara Falls, NY with my family. The restaurant is right off the highway, and has a huge sign that reads RESTAURANT.  The special of the day is hot turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy. I had that with a side of tomato herb soup and coleslaw. Everything is DELICIOUS! The restaurant has plenty of room, it's quiet, and everyone is very friendly."}
{"text":"My friend and i are very particular about food. Stopped at this restaurant and was very very pleased.  Food was yummy especially homemade coconut cream pie.   New owner was vreag5.  Need 2 try. t"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and service was SLOW. I had a scramble. The cheese was two slices of nearly melted plastic. The home fries were blah and everything wasn't integrated as you'd expect in a scramble. Needed more egg, real cheese, grease, and probably hash browns would have been a better choice to hold everything together and have it slide down easy. The portion was surprisingly small for the most expensive breakfast item.

I hate to write a negative review as this seems to be a family run restaurant and everyone was really nice but they need to work on their product and speed of service. I think the speed might have had something to do with them being \"crazy busy\" at the time, which really was as busy as a normal diner located in actual civilization :-) I don't mean that to knock the area. That is a beautiful section of God's Country between Williamsport and NYS."}
{"text":"I was with 2 other adults and 2 kids. We were the only table in the place. The service was extremely slow. We all had the fish special  haddock, Mac and cheese and stewed tomatos. It's more than 12 hours later and we are still all sick. All three adults have been sick since about 30 mins since we left. Running to the bathroom all night. 
The food was not even good. We left half of what came on the plate, on the plate. 
Will not go back to this place."}
{"text":"This place was so yummy!  Salad fresh from a farm down the road. Everything local and prepared in the restaurant.  Our server was the same age as my oldest teenager but professional and attentive.  

This was a classic no frills family restaurant and lacked a bit of ambience and atmosphere but my family and I have way-pointed this place in our GPS and will be back on our next trip to Niagra Falls. Great stopping point coming from the Baltimore/DC area."}
{"text":"Wonderful, quick stop of the highway.  Good food prepared well. We had the bacon cheeseburger and the beef cheese steak. Both were delicious! Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend going to the bakery/deli across the street instead. The Landing Strip is a bizarre diner with no decor and extremely mediocre food. Although my husband did enjoy the chicken tenders, they were \"out\" of all of the sides he wanted by 1130am and the vegetable of the day was (frozen) peas. Not our kind of establishment and we really aren't too picky. Also I felt like we had to whisper because sound traveled so easily as there was zero decor to break things up. People were very nice, though."}
{"text":"Quality comfort food, affordable prices. Staff was very courteous. We had two different burgers, both very well done, soup and cake. Check this place out, nice for the area."}
{"text":"We waited for our food after ordering for well over an hour. No updates. No apologies. 3 adults, 3 kids. Burgers and sandwiches, nothing complicated. Burgers were ordered medium but were burned to a crisp, like black crust on the outside and the kids had a hard time biting through them. Chicken breast on  the grilled chicken sandwich wasn't cooked through. Some of the French fries were still raw in the center. Seriously terrible. We talked to our server about it, reiterating that we knew it wasn't her fault, but that there was a problem...no response. Nothing. Not an apology, no manager. It wasn't crowded. Lunch on a Sunday. Seemed like plenty of staff there. Glad we were just passing through and will never have to stop there again.  I'm not a complainer.  I wasn't expecting it to be stellar, but this was really THAT bad."}
{"text":"Food here was alright, this palce is in Liberty Pa, about 30 miles north of Williamsport, Pa. right off the highway so it has easy on / off access. There is plenty of parking and the staff is nice. We just ordered like an omlette and scrabbled eggs, it was alright, we paid our bill and left. We were in the area traveling and we saw a sign on the highway. 

it was decorated with all kinda of pictures of airplanes, pilots and hot air ballons and stuff, kind of neat. the actualy kitchen was partially exposed so you could watch the people cook."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in for the Friday fish fry special and were not disappointed. Shrimp, bay scallops and flounder done up in a nice crisp breading. Served with home made French fries and cole slaw that were scrumptious. All for less than $9 apiece. (We had no room for dessert.)

We'll be going back to sample their buffet table next. Tonight it held fried chicken, barbeque ribs, cherry stone clams, shrimp, fried and baked fish and much more. 

Decor is basic and open. Service was excellent. They have no beer, wine or liquor on the premises...but their raspberry ice tea is excellent."}
