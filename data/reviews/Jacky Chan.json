{"text":"Terrible delivery time. I ordered at 6:36 and my food arrived at my house at 7:52. I live LESS THAN A MILE AWAY."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jackie Chans for the last two (2) years, and everything was ok util today.  Stop by for a quick take out lunch and as I'm paying my bill, one of the cook is pulling out a two foot roast of something, from that thick neck down the shoulders I saw drop down as normal, but the arms pointed straight out at a 90 degree angle. I asked him right away what is that animal, he said its duck, it's duck. No matter how many times I see it in my minds eye, that was not a duck or bird. Never going back to that place again. My opinion."}
{"text":"Milk tea are really Hong Kong style ~~not those made from powder!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Good prices, big food. Didn't like the fried shrimp appetizer much but the rest of the menu was great! 
Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"Terrible. I will never go again. Ever!! Lunch special is cheap because the every shrimp dish has only 3 pieces of shrimp. They are skimping and food is overly greasy and way too salty. Plus the people are rude."}
{"text":"Eat here once a week lunch specials are great tried almost everything the lemon chicken number one is my favorite when you get it there they pour the sauce on and it makes a sizzling sound it's really good"}
{"text":"Hahaha... The name is just too funny! When I first heard about a new Chinese/Thai fusion? joint opening up close by, I asked myself, what in the world does Jacky Chan? a play on Jackie Chan's name? Maybe? Maybe not? Have to do with food? Nevertheless I actually think it's pretty funny.  
Ok, the food is really not too bad. Actually for the amount of food you get for your money is really good. Most take-out places don't even allow you to take soup to go, but they offer you 2 choices and package everything up for you. I usually get the dinner special, It usually comes with whatever you order, i.e. kung pao chicken, soup, rangoons, rice, and sweet and sour chicken. 
I have yet to try the Thai portion of the menu, but I would suspect it wouldn't be as good as the Chinese? That will be for another day."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chinese in Vegas! Fast, fresh and good pricing. Reminds me of the food I got back in Boston which was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Will not allow changes or substitution on combo plates. As a tofu person there was only one option which I didn't want. Will not be coming  back"}
{"text":"Best fast food Chinese place in town. Eat here and you'll never go back to Panda Express."}
{"text":"Worst Pineapple fried rice I've ever eaten. Literally just tastes like plain white rice. The shrimp they added to it were good, but literally that's all the flavor that this dish had. And it had raisins in it?? I've eaten Pineapple fried rice from many Thai restaurants, and have never had raisins in my rice.... 
safe to say I probably won't be back here."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! Been coming here since they opened. Food is great, place is clean. My favorite Chinese food restaurant in Vegas, the egg drop soup is ridiculously delicious!"}
{"text":"Much tastier food than XO down the street.  I've been here a couple of times and was very happy with the service and staff, and the food had lots of flavor."}
{"text":"This place was below expectation. I was feenin for some chicken curry and ordered it, which was watered down, generic chicken crap. The food is oilier than the BP oil spill !  Jacky chan sure did open a can of whack food whoop ass!"}
{"text":"This is one my new favorite places to come eat. Everywhere I go I order shrimp fried rice and it was perfect. The food is fresh and tasty. My wife is in love with their orange chicken which contained freshly squeezed orange slices. Best chinese resrtaraunt so far, not only the food but the customer service is fantastic! A+"}
{"text":"I can't believe but it's really such a filthy place, I saw a mice there, damn"}
{"text":"I like the Mongolian sauce here. The Mongolian beef is very tender. This time I ordered delivery for Mongolian chicken and salt and pepper shrimp. (Delivery fee is only $2.50! That's like gas!) I upgraded one of the side white rices to fried rice for $1 more. Not much of a flavor upgrade. No added meat, hardly any egg. I've had the combo fried rice which comes with shrimp, pork and chicken. I'll stick to that. I loved the Mongolian chicken. They should add it to the menu! And the salt and pepper shrimp had great flavor! You can get it deshelled but the shell is soft enough that it's very edible. I like the crunch! Pretty much anything batter fried here is way too bready for my taste. I'd avoid ordering those types of entrees, but overall, good Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Great on so many levels.  Timely delivery to my home, as well as when dining in the restaurant.  The freshest of ingredients with enticing aromas the lure you in from the moment that you walk through the door."}
{"text":"Let me first disclose that I used a Grubhub coupon that allowed me to save $10. Trust me when I say this place would've gotten 1 star if I had paid full price. 

We ordered the \"large\" general chicken and pork fried rice. I'll start with the pork fried rice. It was okay. Thoroughly mediocre. Not terrible, not great. Wouldn't even say it was good. I think Panda's fried rice is better and honestly you could make it just as good at home. 

The big failure of this meal was the chicken. First, large? Really? There was maybe ten pieces of chicken total. Ten pieces of chicken that were thickly coated in some fried goop that within minutes becomes soggy and nasty, separating from the chicken itself resulting in small tidbits of chicken and a shit ton of yucky, soggy, fried dough that tastes like old funnel cake with some random sauce on it. I like fried food, I really do, but if Jacky Chan wants to be more honest they should put this on the menu as fried dough coated in general sauce served with a minuscule amount of chicken. 

Save your money. Go to Panda, make your own, just skip this place unless you're desperate or have a coupon."}
{"text":"About once every few months i get an INSANE craving for their garlic seafood fried rice. Its why this place exists for me.

Their orange chicken isnt bad either, definitely better when eaten at the restaurant. Take out boxes makes the fried breading lose its crunch."}
{"text":"I like the fact that this place is like 2 mins away from where I live. Super quick delivery and good food too!"}
{"text":"We stopped here seeing the McDonald sign and went here instead due to the Thai food advertised. We had the Jackie Chan chicken special, broccoli chicken and Singapore noodles. All of the dishes were good. We missed the Thai food menu which  looked yummy too.  The service is  really good and fast.  We are happy we ate here and had a good start to our vegas vacation"}
{"text":"I order from here once every few weeks, and I've never been disappointed!

Tonight, I called in a delivery order. General's chicken, crab rangoons, and cashew chicken. 
I asked about their Yelp check-in deal, and they said that it was based off the delivery total.
I ended up being applicable for spring rolls, and an upgraded order of my crab rangoons.

The person taking my order said is would be 40-45 minutes, and it ended up only being 20! They had my name, address, and my gate code already saved in their system.
The delivery driver was very nice, respectful, and everything was boxed up nearly.

I will continue to order delivery from them :)"}
{"text":"OMG... Why is every local Chinese place completely greasy & disgusting....EXCEPT   for the Panda on Rainbow near the Best Buy/ Home Depot?? I just can't get a decent meal!! 

Give me a Pei Wei!!! Give me a Pick up Stix. Please. :("}
{"text":"We love Jacky Chan's and it's super easy to grab a dinner and go!  The food is tasty and ordering is always quick for take out! They're accommodating to special requests and my order is always right!  The only complaint I have is that they got rid of the 1/2 order of the spicy smoked beef!"}
{"text":"The food is fabulous and the service from the waiter to the cooks is top notch. At first I thought it was just a little fast food place like the big chain with a zoo animal! But it is absolutely wonderful if your only wanting perfect Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Quick delivery and good prices. My roommates and I love to hit this place up when we get the craving for some Chinese food."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Singapore noodles here...they kick P.F. Changs' ass!  Get them without egg and pork and you will want to gorge yourself on them!  The prices are super reasonable and the staff are very friendly and helpful!  This is quickly becoming a weekend favorite...nay a necessity...for my whole family!  You can't go wrong here...even if you tried!"}
{"text":"I've been a loyal costumer for two years, their lemon chicken is amazing! Their boba is great (I suggest the avocado, it's the only one made fresh)! Their service is great and their food is very good for its affordable prices! My go to when I'm in the mood for Chinese fast food!"}
{"text":"First time coming to this place, disappointed in the customer service. Other than that, food was great."}
{"text":"Understandably it's Superbowl Sunday, so the 1 hr late delivery is forgivable but the generals chicken disappointed- tasted like tomato soup mixed with vinegar! Ordered spicy but certainly didn't get that either- all around disappointing!"}
{"text":"Loved this place good staff and good food. Close to the house and they deliver hot and fresh. Like everything they have"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery Chicken Pad Thai & Spicy Eggplant w/ steamed rice. Loved it! Hot, just enough spice, very satisfying. Quick & friendly delivery. Will order again."}
{"text":"We were on a road trip to National parks for six days with sandwiches and BBQ almost every single day..... When we were done with our last stop to Red Rock Canyon, kids refused to eat anymore of the fast food.  We found this Chinese restaurant which offers rice and noodles on the way leaving from red rock to go to fwy15.  We ordered hot soup, crispy noodles, orange chicken... Even though it was the American-Chinese food, not authentic, we were satisfied!!! 
Besides, the portion was unbelievable huge.  For family of four, we ordered three dishes and had three large boxes of left over."}
{"text":"Good menu & prices, decent delivery and very nice delivery man. I wanted to like it but ultimately the food was too salty for my husband and I. If this is something that can be changed I would definitely give them another chance."}
{"text":"I miss you, old Jacky Chan!!!! Writing this because after getting our usual takeout, we realized ownership has changed and it's not the Jacky Chan we are used to. I don't write a lot of reviews, I think most reviews are biased and kind of annoying. So I'll try to be short and sweet. The good: the space is clean (not that the old wasn't: I miss the Buddah statue in the front, and the warm, inviting family environment) the new menus on the wall look great. The food isn't awful, but is absolutely lacking in originality and soul. I get it, it's americanized chinese food. But taste is important, and the flavors before were so, so good. The recipe the old Jacky Chan owners had for Wor Wonton Soup was unbelievably astounding. As was every other recipe we tried. The broth was out of this world, tasted like it was made with real bones and meat in the broth. The new soup: broth is flavorless and bland, the extra veggies are nice, but it's SO not the same. We also ordered a combination veggie/meat dish to go with our soup, and the result was the same. A complete lack of flavor. We are so, SO sad to see our beloved Jacky Chan change into new hands. New owners: I wish you the best of luck, but please: secure those original recipes, or consult with an actual chef who can teach the ways of the broth. Buying consumme and cheap cuts of meat from Cisco or Restaurant Depot is not the way to go. Also, please use some salt. You have some serious locals who want to remain loyal, but your chefs need to step up their game."}
{"text":"***Highlights***: CHEAP EATS UNDER $10, DELIVERY, Leave the makeup at home: you're never going to run into anyone. 

Something you should know: Least greasy Chinese food I've ever ordered. 

Target Audience: NOT somewhere you take a date. Somewhere you take your spouse after you have lived together forever and have seen them burp at the dinner table. This place is great for the lazy person, or the person too sick to get out of bed.

Food: Non-Authentic Chinese. (but i'm okay with that!)

Food Price: Under $10. Their lunch special is around $6, dinner special is $9.50. Each comes with sweet sour chicken, one choice of entree, crab ragoon, fried rice, and choice of soup. Add a Boba drink for $3.50! There are 24 different flavors, on ice or blended as a slushy. Lots of food for the price, it takes me about 2 sittings to finish. Because there is so much variety, I don't get sick of it by the second day. I always have leftovers. Enough food for a guy though. This is as healthy as Chinese food is going to get. Yes, the food is smothered in sauces like panda express, but it's not as greasy. They use lean white chicken breasts for all their chicken dishes and they cook with crisp fresh vegetables. When I'm hunting for delivery yet attempting to be healthy, I order Shrimp & Snow peas off the regular menu. Not as much variety as the Lunch/Dinner Special. But it's the same price, clean, simple, Low-carb, Less-sodium.

Ambiance: Mom & Pop, hole in the wall :)

Cleanliness: SPOTLESS! There is definitely nothing fancy about this place, but you can see that the kitchen and seating area is clean. They are always wiping their counters, tables, chairs. Wet towel, dry towel. I've NEVER sat at a wet table or chair. No drips on their soy sauce ramekins. I've seen their employees wash their hands multiple times. They get a extra star from me just for that. I'm all about hole in the wall places that are clean.

Wait-Time: Quick Service"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because it's close to the house, we had cravings for some fried rice, they had a lunch special price and we were just starving. 
Well it turns out this place is really good, they brought us our food and drinks, we got beef and vegetables with fried rice and it came with soup, wontons and sweet and sour chicken for around $5 each. The food was good to us we aren't picky eaters. 
I am giving this place a four because there is always room for improvement."}
{"text":"Good service. Too bad all of the food was so bad. Very bland & dry. No flavor & very very few pieces of meat. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Have come here twice.  The fairly inexpensive lunch specials keep bringing me back.  Wish you could choose 2 different entrees as the specials always come with sweet and sour chicken, but I won't complain.
   The food is decent in regards to taste, but I'm more impressed with how fresh it is.  Definitely enjoy this place better than Panda Express, the portion size is adequate.  No fanfare, no frills, good service... also I'm one those that loves the name lol"}
{"text":"We have ordered twice now for delivery and have been fully satisfied both times. They forgot our crab rangoons and the driver went all the way back and brought us double order. Yum! It isn't the greatest top notch cuisine ever but for the price and service its delicious!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. They were not willing to make substitutions on lunch specials. Every Chinese food establishments I visit make substitutions. The food was nothing special and I will be adding this restaurant to my list of just ok places to eat."}
{"text":"Deliver is fast in the mountains edge area.  
Lunch plates are a good size, but for the money your better off with other places in the area considering there is little to no flavor.

Just so no one orders and gets disappointed like I did. The spring rolls are really egg rolls & not the best, mushy substance in the middle could have been veggies but I could not eat them. 

The General Taos chicken was bland to the point I couldn't tell what if any flavor was on it and the meat was dry."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food here. Now I'm not saying it's the best I ever had but it's quite delicious. I always order Moo Goo Gai Pan my favorite dish. It's tasty and the meat is soft. Their egg soup is just okay. Staff is friendly and they clean up after you once you are done with your food, which is actually pretty great considering its Chinese fast food. The place itself is clean unlike some other ones I've been to. Would come back here again."}
{"text":"I hate it when people like the food but give less stars. For 6 years JC has been my go to for semi fast food and has not disappointed me if they had a 6 stars I would give it to them."}
{"text":"We Love them.  Food taste fresh.  Employees are great   What more too ask for?  Best Chinese anywhere in Las Vegas.  Will you deliver me some right now. I'm around the corner?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great people and awesome food and Boba drinks, especially the passion fruit. Must try the honey garlic deep fried pork chops and jacky chan chow mein Hong Kong style with gravy. Keep up the good job!"}
{"text":"Despite cautious reviews, I ordered from Jackie Chan's because Rice n Noodle was too far of a distance. Jackie Chan's is literally across the street from my house, but I requested delivery so I wouldn't have to pack up my kids and get on the road. I figured it would aleast be hot, even if mediocre.

Ordering on yelp went soothly and it arrived on time, yet the food was gravely disappointing, if not gross. I ordered sweet/sour pork, sesame chicken, and lemon chicken. All appeared to be the same product with different colors of gelatinous goop. Red, brown, and yellow - indistinguishable of chicken or pork flavor. 

The Mongolian Beef presented with authentic (grasping here) crispy noodles that made me think the dish had promise. But no, it was chewy and lack spices of any kind - so bland I could have feed it to my two year old (though I couldn't,  since he may have choked on the tough meat). 2-stars are awarded for assumed cleanliness and the easy use of the app which allowed me to avoid speaking to cashier.

Overall? Total waste of $40 bucks."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 10 times and every time the food is great. Very flavorful and delicious. Two dishes I highly recommend are the Mongolian beef and the chicken and shrimp Pad Thai. Plus the prices can't be beat for the quality you get."}
{"text":"Had the food delivered and it was quick. The Egg Drop soup was on point and the General Chicken was good also. So if you looking for a quick dinner or lunch and cheap hit this place up"}
{"text":"Found a piece of burnt plastic bag in my chicken. Not coming back. Have been eating here for a while but no more. They didn't look too busy when I went to pick up my food so I don't know why they couldn't be more careful."}
{"text":"Enjoy the food and service here! Always speedy service either dining in or carry out!"}
{"text":"Blegh! The only reason I went here was because I really needed Chinese food in my life but was too lazy to travel. So I went right down the street. The food VISUALLY looked appealing but flavor totally escaped this place. I guess, salt, pepper, broth, onion and any other seasoning is not allowed here. I was so super disappointed. Save your money and just go to the usual place that you go to and avoid this disappointment."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Jackie Chan's. Its close to Mountain's Edge and the deliver. I didn't have high expectations, so I wasn't  disappointed. We ordered singapore rice noodles, chow fun, salt and pepper  pork and fried chicken wings. I do have to say the noodles were very bland. I had to doctor up the noodles. A bit of salt and siracha and now its edible. My friend enjoyed the pork chops and I enjoyed the chicken wings. Other than that we will only order for convenience rather than crave their food."}
{"text":"I love their sizzling rice soup.  Ingredients are not consistent, they use more or less variety of veggies,but it's hard to find restaurants that serves the Sizzling Rice Soup.  Service is good.  Maybe more friendly than other places alike."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I ordered two combo plates. Shrimp fried rice, sweet & sour chicken, he ordered beef & broccoli & I ordered orange chicken. I was so disgusted after my first bite of the orange chicken I couldn't eat another piece. It tasted like left over chicken and the sauce was non existent. The shrimp fried rice was great, but who can mess that up? The sweet & sour chicken I was able to eat a couple of bites but only bc the sauce covered up the bland, left over taste. The beef & broccoli my boyfriend ordered was good, but the egg rolls were all dough & no filling.  I'd rather have panda express."}
{"text":"I may have been a little harsh. I will have to try something else here. But no more lemon chicken or sweet & sour chicken please! TY"}
{"text":"Awful! This place use to be a mere 3 star at its best but man did tonight disappoint. At first I thought ok well I guess it's my fault for ordering Thai food at a Chinese place but then again even the Chinese food was horrible. I'm not sure what happen that made this place go from bad to worst but it did. 

I order the Thai Mint Chili thinking it was going to be the ground meat with mint stir fry. I was wrong. I order port with curry \"Sauce\" that should've been the first red flag and a big give away and the beef and broccoli. Then there was the combo app and they got the pot stickers wrong. How can you get pot stickers wrong! Ugh. I ended up throwing everything away. 

The egg rolls were super skinning with almost nothing in it but it had a decent Chinese five spice flavor to it. The pot stickers tasted stale like they have been microwaved too long and then deep fried if that. 

The pork with curry sauce was Chinese BBQ pork and some package curry sauce. What the heck why wasn't it regular pork. I never even imagine they would use that pork. But even if they did use regular pork it wouldn't have made up for the big let down. The Thai Chili woof I don't even know what that was. Weird favor and no mint in sight. 

The beef and broccoli....really it had the worst bitter taste to it and the meat had this weird tasted almost like propane and Oyster sauce only. My wife and I stop eating everything completely in fear of you no the F.P. Cross my fingers I'll be ok tonight! 

I guess there was a reason why we stopped coming to this place, I was getting burnt out with Rice and Noodle, dang it I should've stuck to what I know was good!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to start a thriving new business, please open a Chinese food take-out restaurant in my neighborhood because Jackie Chans Chinese and XO Chinese (The other Chinese food take-out joints) kinda suck! 


Someone please please please open a Chinese food take out shop that is worth ordering on the corner of Cimmeron and Blue Diamond Rd. in Las Vegas, Nevada. Do our neighborhood right, will yah?

Ok... To the review.

My sweet and Sour Chicken came with hardly any vegetables and the sauce was off. I can't put a finger on it, but it wasn't right. The wonton soup had too many tasteless vegetables and not enough broth. the crab Rangoon was tasteless and had almost zero filling. The egg rolls are micro-small. 

I gave this review three stars because if you order over 30 bucks worth of food, they throw in a free chicken fried rice, which wasn't that bad. 

So if you go here, just order the chicken fried rice, k?

Dear JC's, if you're reading this, please up your game. WTPho down the street isn't a Chinese place, and they got you beat by ten miles. 

Let's see some competition!"}
{"text":"Great Lunch Specials! Cheap and Great food; however, they can use the chicken from the sweet and sour chicken for the lemon chicken. But I would go back again! Very Tasty!"}
{"text":"We like this place a lot. Friendly, freshly cooked and super clean. I had orange chicken and it had oranges in it! My husband enjoyed the hot and sour soup and he is picky!"}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food I have every had. I have been ordering from Jacky Chans for over a year now since I moved to the area. I have never ordered anything that I did not like. The delivered is always super fast and piping hot! We also go in sometimes and dine in. They are always super friendly and food is fresh and super fast and hot ! My favorites are the Mongolian beef, chicken chow mein, sweet and sour chicken and beef and broccoli!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food on this guy! Give it a shot and you won't regret it! Keep up the good work and thank you for the late evening cravings!"}
{"text":"Jacky Chan ranks high on my list for places to buy bbq pork fried rice...   Whenever i order it, I cannot stop eating it... it has become a problem... I have also had the garlic eggplant, orange chicken and general tsos chicken... they have all been great... its right around the corner from me, so add convenience to the mix and I will return...."}
{"text":"New ownership, service is fantastic! We got Mongolian beef and Salt&Pepper Pork chop, very good! Great portion size!"}
{"text":"Dine in, take out or delivery, this restaurant seems to offer something for everyone in order for you to get their food. I opted for eating in so as to get the hottest freshest food possible. I also ordered from the whiteboard specials menu. These options are usually all spicy, wish they didn't have everything on special be spicy and an extensive menu otherwise. For the price at $9.50 for a regular combo, they better serve ginormous portions. Granted, they are pretty much the only game in this area for Chinese food. They have to compete with good Chinese restaurants that are downtown that have prices for food ranging from $3.50 to $4.50.

I had the udon noodles with chicken as the special, but it only came with the noodles & chicken, after my waitress said the special was the same as the combo and would include everything. There definitely was an understanding barrier, but she was nice. They did make the meal the way I wanted with the spicy sauce on the side.

I had just tried another Chinese restaurant last week that had good specials served all day, several courses for less than what I paid for here. I'll go back to the other restaurant next time, at least the service was good at Jacky Chan's. Fun name anyway."}
{"text":"Quick and diligent service


We were hungry tonight for Chineese and this was our first time at any Jacky Chan restaurant. The courtious waitress sat us down immediately. No waiting. We ordered drinks and water. The drinks were all exactly as ordered. No mistakes. The refills were right there when our glasses got low. Water too! Did not even have to ask for refills. I never felt like I had to get up and get it myself. Nor, did I feel like I was bothering the waitress for anything. Very nice folks.

Good food
The wonton soup was hot and just right. Very well prepaired. The waitress served it in the proper manner as any high-end resturant would do. The bbq pork rice was prepaired perfectly. Not too flakey or compressed. All entres were exceptional, including the chow mein.

When we were finished, they offered to box the leftovers for us and did so promply.

With the high quality service and food, the price was very reasonable.

I recommend Jacky Chan on Blue Diamond."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I will. To the people who say not bad at all, are you people high or something? I went their because my dad said it is not bad but this time he let me down. The food is sub par and not as cheap as you think. I do not mind the price if the quality matches what I am getting but this place is just terrible. I wanted to give this place a chance because it is right where I live so it was so convinent. I had some workers over so I got some food for them but I felt bad for them.
 The two workers I had were being humble and kind but I could tel they did not like the food as well because they threw away half of it. I am a big German Russian American and these guys are large Mexican Americans. One ting we both have in common is we like to eat. When the laborers do not want to eat half of their free food, you know it sucks. I thought at first it was because I am from LA and maybe I have high standards on Chinese foods but I spoke with a few other buddies who tried it and they think it cusk as well. Too bad there are no good Chinese eateries near by. The closest one to me is 15 miles away on Rainbow and Sahara and it is a buffet."}
{"text":"Food is acceptable but service is bad.  The person taking orders likes to bad mouth customers in Chinese.  If only you know what she says about you.  I will only come back if I m desperate.  NOT recommended."}
{"text":"I always get salt and pepper chicken wings  and the shrimp egg foo young.  It's  always great no matter if it's delivered or a pick up order."}
{"text":"Ordered seafood rice and I thought it was great and a very big portion. I wouldn't bother eating at the restaurant but the food is good in my opinion. Great place for take out or delivery!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not good. I would rather go to the panda express further up the road. I got the cashew chicken for lunch, and there was an abundant amount of cashews, celery, and maybe 2-3 pieces of chicken. That's it! It was definitely not worth the money and I wanted cashew chicken not cashew celery!"}
{"text":"We ordered the 2 person family meal. It took an hour and 20 minutes for us to get it. I asked for the beef to be spicy it was not. The driver told us that he had no change. We won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  Outstanding value.  Huge selection of foods. One dinner menu selection is enough to feed you twice!  Can't say enough about how much I enjoy the food at THE Jackie Chan restaurant!  I can't wait to try more than just the Kung Pao Chicken with their amazing hot n sour soup!  Try this place ASAP!  It's right behind McDonalds (ewwww) at blue diamond and Durango."}
{"text":"My family and i have been going  to Jacky Chan for quite some time now ,   I will  say it's really good Chinese food not too greasy pretty good the only downside is we  like to dine  there but I can't stand their chairs they are  the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on but other than that we love this place."}
{"text":"First time ordering, customer service is very good but the rice not so much. I ordered fried rice which I paid extra for but got steamed rice that was lightly browned. When I called to place my order I specifically asked for dark fried rice. Not overall satisfied with the food. No other city compares to Chinese food in St. Louis, the capital of Chinese food where real fried rice is made!"}
{"text":"This place is my family's go to take out Chinese place. Their salt and pepper pork chop is good. Their honey walnut shrimp has a generous portion. Their Hong Kong style crispy noodle is delicious"}
{"text":"Fresh, not greasy, great flavor! We have eaten here twice so far and have been very pleased. So many Thai and Chinese restaurants seem to be overly greasy, but not so at Jacky Chan! It is cooked to order, so it is fresh, the vegetables were crunchy (we loved the Jacky Chan Combo broccoli with shrimp, chicken, beef and pork!), and the flavor was delicious. We also really enjoyed the kung  pao scallops! They were nice sized, tender, scallops in a very tasty sauce. I like to eat the dried chiles, and these were cooked just enough. The rice is soft and fluffy. The only thing I wasn't too keen on (I would not order them again) was the spring roll. We got a free order of them for spending a certain amount, but they did not have enough filling...it was all wrapper and kind of dry, and tasted mostly like old grease. That was the only disappointment, but at least they were free. Everything else was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't drive out of my way but if you are in the Rhodes ranch/mountains edge area, this place can fulfill the guilty pleasures of ordering \"Chinese\" takeout. 

Went there once to eat in and the service was really good. There were 3 other tables there. Delivery is quick too.

Suprisingly, I enjoy their chicken wings alot. They only serve the flats, no drummettes, but I have more fun eating chicken flats.  The skin is crispy, wing not overcooked, and was well seasoned. I love all fried chicken - southern, Japanese, Chinese, Korean - u name it!

This place is a decent option if you're lazy and just need a quick food fix."}
{"text":"Large portions. Very fresh. Ordered takeout and it was piping hot when I arrived, packaged well, and everything was included. Will be back soon. Our 2 year old gobbled it up!"}
{"text":"Food is over fried and the sesame chicken was terrible. I got home and tried it for the first time and it was so bad I took it back for a refund. I'll never go back. I don't care if it was a \"bad chef day\" I hate that term. Either have all good chefs or shutdown."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is my first 1-star...but I think it is!! :( A night that a few of us were stuck at work going through rush after rush at my shop, we decided to order take out. All of us ate none of it after taking a bite. The rice was salvageable, but everything else's flavor was so disappointing. Sorry guys :("}
{"text":"We were looking at a house in the area & wasn't expecting to eat here. We pulled in for gas at Chevron & I checked it out on yelp while the boyfriend pumped gas. It's 9.50 for a combination plate I thought it was reasonable for everything that comes on the plate. 

*clean * friendly *cheap chinese place. I had a combination plate with orange Chicken, Egg Drop soup & a fountain drink Mr. Pib. The portions were a good size, I couldn't finish what I had so I boxed it. Really REALLY love Crab Rangon & one came with the plate. I was floored at the bad reviews when I truly thought it was delicious.

We dined in figuring it would taste better fresh vs. Driving home smelling the food & it getting cold & soggy. It was quick service even though the kitchen had lots of slips. They use the same chicken in both Orange & Sweet and Sour but it was quality meats. No stringy chicken like some places that cut corners. 

I'd go again no problem!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese Deli Style!

This isn't a place you go for atmosphere.  However, it's clean, service is great, and the food was fresh and delicious.

The combo plates are great if you want soup, an egg roll, crab rangoon, shrimp fried rice, and sweet and sour chicken included with your entree. 

I had the Black Bean Chicken and it was fabulous!  The S&S chicken was great and so was the fried rice.  Other than the pot stickers we enjoyed, the soup egg rolls and rangoon were average but fresh.  No complaints considering the quality of the main courses!  Good stuff, Jacky Chans!"}
{"text":"Super disappointing. I've ordered from this place twice now. First experience wasn't great but thought it was a bad night. Tonight ordered almond chicken, chicken chow mein, and pot stickers. Took an hour and a half to get my food after calling back and being told 20-30 minutes. Food was cold, pot stickers soggy, most of the food was carrots and celery. Fried rice is literally just rice pan fried with maybe a little egg, don't expect actual fried rice. On top of this all, they spilled the soy sauce and the entire bottom of the bag was filled, and food containers soaked in soy sauce. I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible.  

I'd love for these guys to have great food.  They're in my neighborhood.  It would be wonderful to get some nice Chinese food on occasion.  I can't imagine they even taste the food they send out.  Unbelievably bad."}
{"text":"All I added was Sriracha! 

For $6.50 the daily plate special is perfect for me. I love the two meals in one portions! But notice it is a DAILY plate special - not limited to weekday lunch.

Nice variety of menu choices. The serve Thai and Chinese food. The prices are budget friendly for those on a restricted holiday times cost of living. 

Their chicken in garlic sauce has ample chicken with a balance of veggies: water chestnuts, bamboo spots, broccoli, celery, bell pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, onions, carrots, peas, baby corn. Fried rice is a good flavor with eggs.

Do you like saucy rice and spice? This is a recommended plate. Honestly looks like I got more chicken in garlic sauce than I did rice. Or I personally like saucy rice :P

Plentiful table and bar seating available. Clean dining area upon entering. Their front door is heavy though; watch your fingers. Pleasant customer service. Ordered to go and the lady brought my order to the table I was waiting at.

Full belly and... happy!"}
{"text":"This place has the biggest menu you've ever seen. ..the crazy thing is they pull it off everything they make has great flavor I prefer the crab rangoon for free when spending a certain amount of money. I was cool tipping wise and got to know one of the delivery guys I used to tip him really well always being in  blue-collar jobs myself One of their delivery drivers was so cool he bought me a 12 pack of beer when he quit and left for New York... being Irish that says it all! Hope him and his family are doing well!"}
{"text":"Big portions, but that only means you have to stomach a pile of terrible food.

XO is just steps away, go there instead and save yourself from a terrible meal."}
{"text":"For a quick inexpensive meal this is the place to go. Delivery is fast also. Large portions for the price. Wonton soup is amazing"}
{"text":"The food in this place is below-average to average at best but the service, boy oh boy, the service is negative 13 stars, especially the lovely young lady that flings the take-out food in a bag towards you with no regard for the contents. For that reason alone this place should be no stars."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food. The flavor was just not there. I gave the place 3 chances and still couldn't taste it. I guess if you just want to have food in your belly then this is the place for you but I like flavorful food so I will not be back . However, the service and staff was always nice and efficient."}
{"text":"Deserves zero-stars if i go by our take-out meal last night. MUST BE NEW OWNERS because  the cook used to be a 5-star food-diva! Last night we actually threw our meal away! My husband's order of Hot n Sour soup had celery in it, was watery, and inedible! My Sesame Chicken was dry, over-cooked and soggy rather than crispy, tender and moist.  We both kissed our money goodbye, along with the Jacky Chan shameful excuse for food as it went into the garbage!  Oh Crystal (previous owner) Why didn't you warn us?  I had a stomach ache for hours from the three bites of Sesame Chicken i choked down.  Bad Sesame Chicken, and bad Hot n Sour Soup can be had here. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible. My guess is that everyone who gave this place a decent review is Caucasian, because anyone with Asian tastebuds would definitely agree with me that this place is pretty gross. My husband ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special and I (against my better judgement) ordered the shrimp pad thai. Everything was lacking in flavor. The most flavor of anything in my dish was the egg in my pad thai. Pretty sad. However the place was clean and the service was good, but I still won't be returning."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but have had it delivered twice now.  The first time I was told an hour delivery time which I understood because there was poor weather.  Instead of an hour it took 2 1/2 hours.  Again, there was poor weather so I didn't make a fuss about it.  I ordered a week later and was told 20 minutes for delivery.  It took 1 1/2 hours to receive the food.  I have ordered house fried rice which is very bland and house lo mein which was tasty bu not worth the wait.  The employees are nice but I will not order from here again due to the wait time and the food being just okay."}
{"text":"First time customer. Ordered family dinner #2. Mongolian beef had nothing but huge pieces of green onion and a handful of beef. The chow main was seasoned too much with ginger. The shrimp and crab ragoon were fried a little too long. Not much cream cheese in ragoon. More crunch than anything. The Jacky Chan tofu was tasteless. Pieces of meat were bigger than my mouth. The chicken fried rice was thrown in free, but it wasn't much to it. Very plain. Combination fried rice however was probably the best thing out of everything ordered. Will not dine again. Waste of $40!"}
{"text":"I always order boba from here because they mostly taste good and not powdery. Beef Broccoli is my favorite so i order that all the time as well. It tastes much better than Panda Express, trust me. Everyone is friendly and made efforts to make a conversation with me while I wait for my food. I tried delivery for the first time today and they told me to wait 30-40minutes. It ended up being less than 15 minutes. I love them :)"}
{"text":"Love! Order from her at least once to twice a month. They always say 45 minutes and knock on the door 15 minutes later. I've tried others and always was disappointed but never Jacky Chans!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food. I ordered some take-out: the Cashew Chicken dish... it was more like a celery dish with hints of chicken and a couple cashews.  I also got the stir-fry veggies. Not bad. The place is cheap and they give you a lot of food, but it just isn't that great. If you order $15 or more they give you 2 free egg rolls. They were probably the smallest egg rolls I've ever seen."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Delivery was quick, our order was packaged well and the food was fresh.  

I hate when I order delivery and they forget all the condiments, utensils, napkins, etc. Well, this place gets it right. Thank goodness. Plenty of condiments and sauces and packaged well so the stuff wasn't covered in sauce or soup. You know you hate reaching into the bag only to touch a container covered in sticky oiliness. 

The food was pretty good. The only thing I didn't really care for was their sweet and sour chicken. The batter was too thick and soggy and the super sweet sauce was laid on too thick. 

I did enjoy the chicken tofu seaweed soup though as well as my moo goo gai pan. Lots of fresh veggies like it's supposed to be. 

So far this is the best place I've ordered delivery from in the area. Another place on Ft. Apache takes way too long to deliver and they forget stuff in your order."}
{"text":"I don't normally go for Chinese, but it's what the kids wanted.  I ordered them orange chicken, which had this amazing flavor to it, pieces of actual oranges in it, and not at all soggy. Plus, I appreciate that there was lots of sauce on it.  I only regret buying the half size and not the full.  I also ordered the pineapple fried rice, just to try something a little different and I'm so glad I did.  It came in a large portion with three shrimps, chicken, pineapple chunks, and raisins.  I also ordered spring rolls, potstickers, and Mongolian beef (which was disappointing that it wasn't spicy at all). 

Out of all the Chinese places in the Blue Diamond area, I like this one the most."}
{"text":"I wanted to give them four stars again. The last time was for takeout though. First of all, whoever designed this place did not have diner's conversations in mind. When someone would speak they echoed a bit. The ceiling is too high. They make boba smoothies there, when the  blender starts it sounds like a wood chipper running. The kitchen is basically in the same room, same high ceiling. With pots and pans clanging and food frying it sounds like I am having dinner in a traffic tunnel. On to the food.
     I ordered Singapore Style Curried Noodles, it comes with chicken, beef and shrimp. The noodles were Vermicelli I believe. The food was ordered from the walk up counter and delivered to my table hot. It came well seasoned with curry. It also came with liberal amounts of cooking oil applied. My review last time complained of too much salt. Same goes for this time. Take off a star for lack of ambiance and another off for too much oil and salt. Other than that the flavor was great, enough for two and was served on a real plate! I will be returning here again."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Cheap lunch specials. Don't bother asking for the free chicken fried rice with check-in.  We had 10 people and they did not bother giving it to us.  We gave them business but the answer was \"no thanks. Those are expired.\" Don't expect them to be nice to you."}
{"text":"This place is like a hidden gem, the food was very appealing to the eye and seemed to be super fresh. Most places here in Vegas for Chinese food tend to be greasy or just seem dirty. This place was way above my expectations, Its a must try."}
{"text":"Not bad place for quick sit eat and go. Food is decent but service little slacking. They look mean as hell. Special cooks on wok. Like you did something wrong for ordering and making them cook. Sorry guys it is a restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Ordered to take out salt & pepper squid, it was a piece of garbage. So oily, no squid just breaded oily pieces. I would take it back if I wasn't so tired that night! Spring rolls are super oily as well. Don't waist your money! There are way better places to eat out there!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, fresh and good taste. Way better than china go go!"}
{"text":"I'm always amazed at how MEAN people can be on yelp.  They took no exception to this little place that is obviously a family owned establishment and the members are very hard working:  The place is immaculately clean and with a very attentive staff.  Reviewers should take notice that you are talking about REAL PEOPLE when reviewing a small place.  It is not some huge emotionless corporation.  Have some decency.

I've only been once, and had the Pad Thai.  I enjoyed it very much. It was served with a slice of lemon (YES!) which I squeezed over the dish and it brought out beautifully subtle and well balanced flavors.

The bottom line is this: Is this place going to revolutionize the way you view Asian Cuisine?  No.  But is that what they are trying to do?  NOPE.  They want to provide a decent meal at a reasonable price and try to make a living along the way.  For those of you that want to support Ma and Pa restaurants in the community and have a GOOD meal,  this is the place for you.  You might even introduce yourself and possibly make friends with the owners.  Can you do that at Panda Express?

I will definitely go back for as long as I live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I always order take out from here,  the food is pretty good and though the lunch specials are a good price, there's not much. The fried rice is just that. Fried rice with not anything else in it except a pea or two. I suggested getting a combination plate instead,  if you like more of a variety. You get soup, a crab rangoon, a spring roll, your entree choice,  plus sweet and sour chicken and shrimp fried rice. A nice variety for a reasonable price. 
  One more great thing, is they have coupons for free food items if you over a certain amount, and they automatically offer and ask which choice you would like.
  Also, the staff is friendly and the delivery is fast. The reason I gave 3 stars and not more is because the food is goos not great or excellent."}
{"text":"Just got my string bean chicken and shrimp with sizzling rice soup delivered. 20 minutes flat. And that says a lot when you live in Mountain's Edge.( Anybody who lives out here knows it's really hard getting food delivered because there are so few decent options around here as of yet.) And it is oh so gooooood! Plus a FREE order of crab rangoons with my $20 purchase. I am never disappointed! Fresh, hot, delicious, and all white meat chicken. Thank you!"}
{"text":"They don't honor YELP check in coupons. Food is mediocre at best. I see why the place is empty. They say they specialize in Thai but I see no Thai dishes. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Nope. We ordered through doordash, when the food came, it was still warm so that part was good, but quality of the food, not so much. Orange chicken was soggy, and just everything was coated in soggy batter and extra sauce, no bueno"}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I have ever had. Only thing I liked was the Taro smoothie with  the Boba in it. Tried the Mongolian beef, lemon chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and the sweet and sour pork. Had some big hopes for this place, but this place didn't make my list of great places. Customer service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Live right near this Chinese fast food joint and finally decided to try it since I was craving Asian but was super hungry and could not wait to eat.  

My BF and I ordered the combos that comes with shrimp fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, crab rangoon, veggie egg rolls, won ton soup or egg flour soup, and your choice of an entree.  I got the schezuan beef and BF got the mongolian beef.  Both were just OK.  Pretty good bang for your buck.  Not all the food was super yummy, but totally worth it for the price and hunger.  They even serve boba there so I ordered a iced coffee slush with boba.  We also ordered seafood fried rice as a side dish. LOL.

Definitely a place to go for fast food and a asian craving fix.  It wasn't the best food, but good enough to fulfill your hunger.  Definitely will go back for some quick boba!"}
{"text":"Hot and Sour Soup had no taste what so ever! I also got General Tso Chicken at spice level 7 and it was sweet with no spice at all. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"We've been in the area for a few months now and really needed to find a decent Chinese restaurant that delivers to us, which being in a new development in an underdeveloped area the choices are pretty scarce. So, we had two options, Jacky Chan and XO; after reading the reviews here on Yelp we decided on Jacky Chan's. Since we were driving by, we figured we would stop in and try them out for when we wanted Chinese delivery. Our bill came to a little over $53 and let me tell you that the food wasn't worth half that! We ordered the combination appetizer platter, 2 extra eggrolls, sweet and sour pork, beef with snow peas, general chicken, chicken pad thai and beef chow mein. Because the order was over $50 we had a choice of free items and the only thing that we liked from the offerings was crab rangoon. To keep this brief I'll give a quick rundown: 
1. All of the fried items had a horrible old taste, I'm assuming it was due to the fryer oil since everything was made to order. 
2. The eggrolls were thin and mostly wrapping no real filling to speak of
3. Crab rangoon was ice cold, and did not actually have very much crab in the filling mix.
4. Sweet and sour pork was rock hard, even our dogs turned their noses at them 
5. Threw the chicken pad thai out! After two bites I was afraid it was spoiled because of the God awful sour taste and smell, even the color was an off orange. I've had pad thai from many places and have never seen anything like what they offered. 
6. The general chicken had barely a taste to it other than the old fryer oil taste, the sauce wasn't enough to even mask the stale taste. 
7. Beef chow mein wasn't the best but it was edible, though rubbery and oily. 
8. The only dish that we liked was the beef and snow peas, it was hot and had a lot of taste. If it wasn't for this and the chow mein we would have been ordering a pizza. 
It's sad how bad this place is, save your money and look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese close to home. We order the emperors dinner which includes (2) soups (2)fried shrimp, (2)wonton, (2)egg roll, 2 main entrees, and fried rice for $11.95/person delivered. It's a lot of food, usually 4 meals out of it. Fast and fresh delivery."}
{"text":"Only reason this place is getting 1 star is because I cant give zero or negative stars. The \"food\" is terrible, had a couple bites then threw the rest out. I woulda gave it to my dog but he doesnt desrve that lind if punishment. If you want blan, soggy, and flavorless food that saltier than a Cowboys fan after a playoff loss, this is your place."}
{"text":"Called last night around (Thursday) 7:45 pm to placed a order for on party tray of BBQ pork bun for Saturday.  The lady who answered the phone questioned me why I want to place the order now.  She told me it's better to call Saturday morning.  And I was like, why can't I order now since I'm already on the phone with you!?!? 

They just lost a customer since I was going to order more food for them for Friday night but the service received was so poor!!!  
 
I don't understand her logic!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. I ordered the hot and sour soup, it wasn't hot OR sour. Tasted like oil and was just terrible. The egg rolls had pretty much no filling. Even after I took off most of whatever they're wrapped in, I still couldn't taste the cabbage filling on the inside. The rest of their food is just greasy and makes me nauseous. TERRIBLE!! I would never suggest eating here. EVER"}
{"text":"Food is good, and service is fast. My family and I can eat there with plenty of left overs for the next day for 30 dollars."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery,  I had to call 3 times, my order finally arrived one hour and fifty-five minutes later. (Orange chicken, Mongolian beef, 4 egg rolls) that's it. No updates or courtesy calls, hour and 55? I live a block away. Food wasn't impressive at all. Most likely won't order again. If I had gotten a call, running late, were sorry. Maybe I would've tried again. Bad suckie place. Go to xo like everyone says if you actually want to eat."}
{"text":"I only took a star off because it lacks in atmosphere. The food is great and their boba is made perfectly! My favorite boba milk tea in Vegas....nice and tender chewy tapioca balls that don't turn stiff in the middle. Smoothies good too. So fun to eat/drink! The food is very good quality for America Chinese&Thai, perfect lil takeout spot, not so much date night spot though....and that's ok, we all need good takeout!"}
{"text":"This place is good. I love their hot and sour soup. It is at a reasonable price for a large around $6.75 with tax. It is right down the street from Mountain's edge, right next to Chevron. It is a typical mom and pop business. They have lunch specials like all the other Chinese restaurants and sell boba.  The customer service is fine."}
{"text":"This place hardly deserves two stars but 1.5 stars isn't available. I ordered pad thai and the noodles and chicken were rubbery. The flavor isn't great either. My friend orders to go from here all the time so I have had their food on many occasions. It's never really impressive just another restaurant convenient to a lot of homes that are in an area where there is a serious lack of restaurants available. No good Jacky Chan! Up your customer service and quality of food or change your prices and be honest about the food you serve."}
{"text":"The customer service here is great. Every time I pick up an order they always have a smile on their faces. I'm satisfied with the quality of the food. It's not to greasy and their lunch specials is well put together. what really attracted me to this place is the fact they serve boba. I recommend this place if you live in Enterprise part of Clark County.

From what I've noticed as of right now this resturant is under new owner/management. They serve their food alot different than the previous owner."}
{"text":"We went up to location and ordered to go. The food was soggy and wet when we got home gross. The chicken underneath the soggy fried stuff was hard . Also beware they don't put your sauce on your tso chicken or your sweet and sour. You have to do it your self. I won't be eating there again!"}
{"text":"Extremely nice people, Jackie most definitely has a great customer service, great food , fresh and good flavor we will be back again"}
{"text":"The service was ok. the food marginal. Ordered the lunch special.
The fried rice was lousy, Ive never had fried rice as rice only, no vegetables at all and dry. The food itself very little. Curry chicken and beef has much salt. The sweet and sour pork was about the only thing edible. Businesses need to learn you have to give a good value for people to return."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open ever since I saw the wacky name driving by.  It's nothing special, but that's not a bad thing by any stretch.  I thoroughly enjoyed the heat of the Jacky Chan Combination Curry.  We also ordered several other items and it was all enjoyable.

- Jacky Chan Combination Curry
- Beef with Black Bean Sauce
- Shrimp Fried Rice
- Shrimp with Lobster Sauce
- Orange Chicken"}
{"text":"Jackie Chan is not in the house, But.... 

   Jackie Chan is one of a couple Chinese restaurants alongside Blue Diamond Road (Nevada Route 160) in Mountains Edge. It is a short drive from Exploration Park where I had just done some hiking. 

   After hiking in Exploration Park in this hot June afternoon I was up for some Chinese food. I headed to XO to find out that they are closed for refurbishment. In hopes of enjoying some Chinese food, Jackie Chan would come to the rescue. After typing in \"Chinese food\" Jackie Chan appeared. Henceforth I headed .06 east on Blue Diamond to the Walgreens - McDonald's shopping center at Durango. 

  The parking spaces seemed to be tight and few. I was left to park my car by McDonald's. 

  When I walked inside I looked at the lunch special board on the right wall. The lunch specials started at $5.95. They included an entree, fried rice, a sweet and sour chicken, crunchy noodles, and egg drop soup. In my opinion this is a better deal than the place I parked my car by. 

  Jackie Chan seems to have a popular take out business. The man working at the counter was engrossed with take out phone calls before getting to my order. With an additional fountain Coke, I opened my wallet and handed him close to $8.

  From there I seated myself at one of the few tables. I observed that this is a take out restaurant with the staff delivering the food, first round of Coke, and cleaning up the food. Moreover, I observed that Jackie Chan is not in the house. I saw zero pictures, articles, or memorbelia celebrating Jackie Chan. But I did see the Chinese food on my table. 

  Jackie Chan isn't a styrophone and plastic takeout style Chinese restaurant. They serve the soup, food, and drinks on real china. The food that they served me on this real china was ok and nothing to write home about. The egg drop soup and crunchy noodles that proceeded the meal were decent. Ditto for the pepper steak with onions, one sweet and sour chicken, and fried rice. What stood out about Jackie Chan besides the name is that it is the first Chinese restaurant where the lunch special included a sweet and sour chicken. 

   After a hike in Exploration Park, the lunch special got the job done. My opinion of Jackie Chan the Chinese Restaurant is that it is decent but not great."}
{"text":"After moving to our new neighborhood, my husband and I were on a mission to find our \"go to\" Chinese restaurant near our house. We tried Jacky Chan and was impressed! Not only was the food amazing, but the staff treated us like family. \"Jackie\" always comes over to say hello and talks to us like we've known eachother forever. Now when we go to eat, we know whatever we choose on the menu, it's going to taste great! Our favorite is the SPICY GARLIC FRIED RICE!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place Has ordered almost everything on the menu I love it and they are on time in fact with the delivery"}
{"text":"I ordered take out.  Ordering was quick.  It was ready in less than 10mins.  The sweet & sour chicken / pork barely had any taste.  I guess they really are MSG free.  A little more salt would have helped.  It's very cheap, lunch combo is less than $10 but I'm not going back there again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to get chicken chow mein and the honey walnut shrimp, if you had not tried the shrimp you are missing out!! Plus these guys are half the time they say for delivery time! Thank you for always remembering my order!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Tom Kha (with chicken) the other day cause I wasn't feeling good and thought soup would make me feel better so I decided to give this place a try and order for delivery since its so close to my house. The lady that I talked to didn't speak any good English at all, I had to tell her my address so many times and i told her what I ordered I made it so clearly. 
Anyways, the delivery was really fast but when I started to check my food and was about to take a big ass sip on my soup I see a freakin shrimp umm I'm allergic to shrimp like I almost ate that thing! I called them back and this time it was a guy and I told him that they messed up my order and he wasn't really nice about it and I told him to get it right and send me the right one. After 45 minutes later of waiting he finally came and got the order right but I felt very skeptic to even eat my soup cause they seem very shady but I ate it anyway and now I'm sick. Thanks a lot for the bad service,workers there cant even speak english, your food sucks and won't be ordering at this shady place ever again!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Prices are cheap and service is always friendly and prompt. Food is great and the portions are gracious. I highly enjoy the boba as well. I won't order from another Chinese place in this area."}
{"text":"Jacky chan... I will definitely start by saying this is not in the slightest as great as the real Jacky Chan. He would probably be insulted if he found out a place like this named theirselves after him. This is my first time trying this place with my husband. I got the orange chicken with wonton soup and he got chicken curry. The flavor was not there for almost anything. Sadly, the rice was the best part of the whole meal. We decided to order Thai tea boba since we love boba and we love Thai tea. The boba itself was made well however the Thai tea part was very watery. Yuck. To top it off we spent about $20 and asked to use a coupon for 3 free rangoons with purchase of over $16 and were told no that it's for take out only. Sad. We may come back one day but for now it's not looking likely. I would probably give a solid 2 stars but will give 3 for price and the fact that the food was okay, not good but could do better."}
{"text":"This place is great. The people here are very nice and the food is amazing. When I have long day at work and don't feeling like cooking this my number one choice."}
{"text":"OK, the food here isn't the BEST... but i don't think its bad if your craving chinese food, don't want panda express, and don't want to drive all the way to china town.  it does the job.

the prices are decent, and they literally make your carry out order in 5 minutes!

some dishes i recommend:
-mongolian beef
-won ton soup
-salt and pepper pork
-fried rice (any kind!)

beware of the chow mein if your looking for the pan fried noodle type.  its pretty much lo mein and i was disappointed when i ordered it last time we went.

don't forget the carry out order coupons.  i think they have free egg rolls with purchases over 20 and free fried rice with purchases over 30. :)"}
{"text":"Warning they are under new ownership and the food and menu have changed. The broccoli beef was very plain, but the rice was decent. They are also missing several items from the old menu. Overall I am not happy with the changes and will now have to look for another place to eat."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for 4 years now and there is a reason for that, its ALWAYS fresh, my order is always right, and they are always so nice, whether it is over the phone or in person. LOVE ME SOME JACKY CHAN!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Though conveniently located across the street of my gated community, I have always refused to openly try this place because of the several bad reviews on yelp.  But I was hungry as hell today and just finished attending Church and didn't want to go anywhere far from where I live.  So today I gave it a try.

Wow, I'm glad I tried it.  Not the best Chinese food you can have but for what it is, I like it.  Fast , small but clean, and friendly servers....unlike other asian restaurants where they are always yellin' wondering if they are in a bad mood or thats just the way their culture are.  Very affordable prices also, especially their lunch $5.75 special which comes with fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, sour soup, crispy noodles, and another meat of your choice given on the menu.  I got  the general chicken combo which was my first time trying and tasted pretty good.

Maybe at its early days when it barely opened, the food was bad from what I can see from the early reviews, but it seems ok to me now.  Thumbs up if you're hungry, craving chinese, and in a rush.

Jacky Chan definitely kicks ass, you get it? Jackie Chan and kicks ass because he's a martial artist....ahh nevermind."}
{"text":"Went here on my lunch. Ordered Singapore noodles. They usually come with pork and shrimp but I had them sub the pork for chicken. When I went to pick up my ordered I asked if there was chicken and shrimp. They said there was. Drove all the way back to work. What I got were not Singapore noodles...no curry and no shrimp. So what I got is plain noodles with no sauce. I called them and they stated I had to bring the food back otherwise they couldn't do anything. I told them I had driven all the way back to work and only had a 45 lunch. They didn't care. They said they couldn't do anything unless I brought the food back. The manager refused to talk to me. I took the food back and told them I wanted a refund and my correct food due to the hassle and inconvenience of having to drive back. The manager still refused to talk to me in person. They refused to give me another order. The worst customer service ever. Save yourself the trouble. Even if it's their mistake, they don't try to make to make it right. The owner is extremely rude and just kept yelling at the woman helping me that he would not do anything."}
{"text":"I was completely surprised to see that Jacky Chan's only has three stars. I hope that changes soon, because the food is AMAZING! I asked friends on FB where to go for great egg drop soup near Mountain's Edge/Southern Highlands and someone recommended Jacky Chan's. I ordered it to be delivered, and it was a rather large order. Soup, five different boxes of rice/noodles, pan fried potstickers, pan fried veggies, papaya boba. I think nine items total. I barely got to taste my rice and veggies because I simply could not stop eating the soup! It was so delicious, best egg drop soup I've ever had. I ate the entire bowl. Not cup, BOWL. And it's a BIG bowl. I'm still full as I write this and I already want more for dinner. Enough about the soup lol! According to the others in my group, everything else we ordered was fantastic too. The price was great, the staff on the phone was very nice and professional, the delivery driver was super nice and even though I was given a 45 minute delivery window, our food was here in 25 minutes and was super hot. I will most definitely order from here again. Probably tonight. Lol!"}
{"text":"So delicious, all the sauces were so thick and flavorful! Great amount of food for price. And the sit down service was awesome. They even gave us an extra cup of soup and crispy noodles for free for our kids. Love it, we will back."}
{"text":"Noone there speaks english, and they get my order right every time! Bomb Chinese food, would highly recommend.  Great for take out, definitely not a place to go dine in. Take out is top notch though and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The rice is really weird."}
{"text":"Does yuck say enough. The food is so greasy and all tastes the same. Although they do have good wonton soup."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery! Never ordered anything and not liked it! 

Would prefer a different style of fried shrimp tho. They're a little greasy and not very crunchy with a poor shrimp to breading ratio.

Delicious crap puffs and shrimp lo mein! Would recommend those both highly!

Random note but their sodas come in the can or liter bottle which I actually prefer as I'm eating from home and have my own ice.

Great place!"}
{"text":"I've been living near this restaurant for years now and this has always been my go-to spot for Chinese food! The delivery is quick too. My personal favorite is their sweet and sour chicken and their chicken fried rice! They also serve boba which is a plus. However, I'm not a big fan of their Thai tea since it always doesn't taste as sweet. Overall, their food is always satisfying!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service and good food. I never have to tell them my order because they know. That's pretty rare these days. The food is always fresh and fast, tons of different specials."}
{"text":"You can't get the free unlock offer if you make your order through the Yelp app. That should be posted somewhere!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a no star I would. The food has gotten really,really bad. I ordered delivery 3 times and all of those times not only did they take forever but the food was horrible. I don't know if they change cooks or what but I will never order from them again!"}
{"text":"Always good Chinese food. Fast polite service. Never had a bad dish plus it's so close to home"}
{"text":"I think this place has markedly improved since it opened. It's not the best place in town, but the food is about average or slightly above. They make one of my favorites,  almond chicken, just like I'm used to from California. Their fried rice is decent, if you order it dark. XO Pad thai is pretty good. Hubby likes their roast duck. We really like Boba drinks. All in all a pretty decent little chinese joint."}
{"text":"Not bad food at this place. Close to my apartment. Not the cheapest prices but I am used to east coast chnese food prices. I a having to get used to the different food cooking syles and increased prices. All in all not a bad place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Love this place salt and pepper shrimp,roast duck, chow fun is amazing !!! Must try. I'm glad I don't have to drive all the way to china town for great Chinese food"}
{"text":"I literally only get one thing here and it's the House Special/General Tsao's chicken. I hope a restaurant review based upon a sole item won't be frowned upon but in their defense, this dish is so so good!  It is much more different than other general tsao's I've tried. The crust or \"fry\" on the chicken has a lighter and airier crunch than most. I think it is attributed to the higher cornstarch vs. flour ratio in the batter. The pieces are also cut into larger chunks which makes me feel like I'm eating less processed, good quality white meat chicken.  I don't know what all they put in that general tsao's sauce but I could literally eat anything slathered in that sauce. It seems to have a lot of honey or brown sugar that makes it much more caramelly than other sauces I've tried. I've never attempted to make a homemade version of this sauce but I know it will never compare so why bother trying.  
The egg drop soup is on point and I especially like the fried noodles they serve with the soup. Eggroll is perfectly crisp and filling is good. For their lunch specials, I find it strange that there is always a portion of sweet and sour chicken included. Frankly I would like to have it all general tsao's style but hey I'm not complaining. Maybe it's their signature dish or something Idk.  I want to try the boba one day but it's most likely a powder mix and no fresh fruit."}
{"text":"Not good. .we always get circulars so we thought we would give it a try. Everything was bland. .egg fun Yung was horrible, and curry. .they say Thai but only have 2 items. Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"This is near the best Chinese fast food in town. Good service, LARGE portions, great prices and tasty! Very clean joint as well. If you are looking for a lunch or quick dinner, this is IT!"}
{"text":"They are clean but like most chinese fast food places you only rent the food here. I live 3miles away and my date and I barely made it home. I wish I had two barhrooms in my apartment. For the price you get plenty of food and the staff is amazingly nice and attentive."}
{"text":"As a first time customer, I admit the name drew me in. I don't live in this area so I can't compare this restaurant to others in the area, but my combination fried rice was very good. I checked yelp reviews after I ordered, and they were pretty mixed. 
The only suggestion I have is the meat wasn't seasoned or grilled (other than the BBQ pork). The rice was cooked well and there was plenty of egg, which I think makes the dish. 
Hot, tasty food served quick at a reasonable price- just what is needed in this area."}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase.  The food is okay.  If you are in the area, and you want a quick bite, hit this place up.  If you have a hankering for some good Chinese food, I'd suggest you drive down to Spring Mountain, or better yet, California (the state, not the hotel).

Having just come back from LA, where I had some mind blowingly good Chinese, I was let down here.  I would put this restaurant in the same taste category as Panda Express.  It's tasty for what it is, but it's not really Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is great and the hours of operation are very convenient.  I like the specials they offer and trying the new items for the day.  They are always good and the food is top notch.  And not that it matters but it seem to with another reviewer, I'm Asian.  

I only gave it four stars because it is not the best Chinese food I have ever had but It's way better than the other offerings we have in that area including China a Go Go and China Xpress, just down the road.  

As a special positive note that may make you laugh, I had to use the bathroom the other day when I was picking up my order and.... it was clean.  No trash on the ground, no urinal with mystery stains.  No faint odor of cigarettes.   That is always a plus in my books when the restroom facilities are clean, I have more faith in the ones in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Had them last night. Great morning left overs. The staff is polite and courteous. I love their beef Mongolian. I feel like they bread their chicken too much it is mushy. BUT great place, fast, good, and clean!"}
