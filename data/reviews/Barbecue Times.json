{"text":"Awesome food. Great veggie options. Love picking up kebabs for takeout

Try the veg kebab platter to get a taste of all options. Good food for the price"}
{"text":"I really found the food here delicious.  We went for a weekday lunch buffet. A variety of hot amazing food and not to heavy.  My fav was the paneer kari. And of course the table side fresh BBQ chicken.  Would love to go back with my hubby.
The gulabjamun was the best I've had."}
{"text":"Came here for the concept.  I wanted to love it.  The buffet was pretty standard fair.  The charcoal ovens are great.  It's nice to see the care taken to see and experience the open flame.  

However having the food precooked and is just heating for 8 mins is not as fulfilling.  I understand the why.  I just enjoy cooking the whole thing.

Service beyond great, cleanliness superb.  

It is a great concept it's just not quite there in my opinion.  Much appreciate the concept.  It made me Feel like I should sneak in a steak!  

A great idea, give it a go"}
{"text":"I read an article about this place online, which is why I wanted to try it. A 'cross-cultural grilling experience' was what I expected and never got. The article mentioned it was a mix of Indian, Chinese and North American, so my expectation was that you could grill a variety of items at your table. With a name like Barbecue Times, I certainly didn't expect only Indian food, but alas that's all it was. 

When we got there, we were quite confused as to how it all worked. No menus or instructions were given until we flagged down one of the waiters to tell us. 

There was a buffet table on the side with a variety of curries (I did think the butter chicken and goat curry were very tasty!) and some vegetable dishes as well. I thought it was odd to have chicken fingers as an option - the 'North American' bit I suppose. So we go and pick out what we wanted and went back to our seats. We were told that they would bring out the char charcoal grill momentarily. I asked if we got to pick what we wanted and the waiter said they give us one of everything and we just ask for more of what we liked after. 

Anyway, the grilling part was what I was most excited about, but the wait felt like forever! I had finished my first plate from the buffet table before they brought the kebabs out (about 15 after we were seated). To be honest I was already getting full at this point. So they explained that the kebabs had been precooked and we just had to wait 7-8 mins for them to 'finish cooking' on the table! (Are you kidding me, more waiting!) This wasn't the experience I was expecting at all. Once the kebabs were done, they were actually quite good! The red tandoori chicken tasted a little weird, but everything else was very good. Though I didn't get to fully enjoy them since I was so full from the other things we ate while waiting for the grill.

I really like the concept of it and some of the food was actually quite enjoyable, but the execution of it could use some tweaking. I think I'll wait a few more months to try it again hopefully they make some improvements!!"}

{"text":"Worst buffet.. food was salty & very limited items.. grill items were precooked & warmed at the grill on table, it wasn't fresh & tasty. Very expensive for the food they provide."}
{"text":"We came as a party of 3. 

The server was really friendly and a pleasure to deal with. She was very attentive and quick to come when needed.

We have mixed feelings about the food though. We ordered 6 items from the a la carte menu as they no longer do the buffet dinners on weeknights.

The fish pakoras were excellent! The basa filets were perfectly battered and fried. $14.99 for a plate. A bit pricey but we would order them again.

The samosas were fridge-cold in the centre so we had to send them back. The house-made tamarind chutney and green chutney were amazing! The samosas themselves were nothing special. Order them only if you're desperate for an appetizer.

The chicken tikka at $11.99 was overcooked and overpriced--it came with one naan on the side, and two small drumsticks and one thigh cut into two pieces laid on top of some julienned vegetables on a sizzling plate. We will never order that dish again! 

The butter chicken was passable. The sauce was too sweet it almost tasted like ketchup. It was served with one naan and a bowl of rice.

The highlight of our dinner was the chicken biryani. Oh, my gosh! That dish came with ample, tender, juicy pieces of chicken breasts and perfectly seasoned basmati rice dressed with raisins and cashews. We loved it and would come back just for that!

We had ras malai for dessert. It was delicious! The cream had the right amount of sweetness. The chenna was firm yet moist. It was sufficiently garnished with pistachios. We would order this again too!

As this is a new restaurant, we hope they take our feedback and improve the dishes that fell short."}
