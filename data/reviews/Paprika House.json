{"text":"Every single thing here is so good!  The hortobagy is the very best and the closest to traditional I have ever had.  The family who run this place love what they do and it shows the way they treat their customers.  Three times a week is never enough!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on our weekend in Calgary.  None of us had ever had Hungarian Food.  The staff was friendly.  Talked us through the menu; Gave us multiple suggestions as to what we might like the best.  We ordered at least 3 different menu items.  They were all fantastic.  And then we had crepes for dessert and they were a fabulous way to end the meal.  I cannot recommend this more fully!   Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great value, great schnitzel and really nice helpful staff. Was introduced by a friend from Germany who raves about how it tasted like home!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing.  Delicious home cooked taste and feel.  I loved it.  I had the cabbage roll and stuffed pepper with boiled potatoes and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I went from not knowing what Hungarian Food was to I love Hungarian Food! The Spätzle, the hearty stewy gravy, it was pretty amazing.

Old world veggie sides, filling potato dishes, friendly people. You gotta go check it out!"}
{"text":"Simply wonderful. 
Staff is the sweetest. Place looks very nice and authentic. Plates are huge. And, best of all, the food is A.MA.ZING.
Also, the owner is very, VERY awesome and will gladly tell you about the origin and the particularities of the dishes. I just can't recommend it enough / speak any more highly of it, just so glad we stopped by there... We might even make it a habit!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy Eastern European food, don't miss this restaurant! A friend of mine from Slovakia attests to the authenticity. Only one review isn't 5 stars, and they ordered a French lunch (Chicken Cordon Bleu). Very generous portions, excellent quality, value and service. Try one of the dessert crepes! Here's yet another 5-star review, well-deserved. Thank you, Paprika, for many delightful meals."}
{"text":"With anticipation dropped in for some real Hungarian food, but the bowl of goulash they served up was watery with very few meat or veggies in it, and any flavours were so diluted as to be marginal at best.
Perhaps I was spoiled by the Goulash House years ago on Dundas in Toronto where the soup-stew was chockful of beef chunks and sliced veggies, and the small loave that one tore apart for dipping, all that was so good and peasant-like as to be in a small village in the old country!
But here at Paprika House?
Even though the owners and waitress are European, I cannot rate it better. Maybe they were having a bad day, or I need to return sometime to check out other dishes. 
Not sure I will. 
Too bad."}
{"text":"We had an incredible meal at Paprika House while in Calgary for our honeymoon. The food was incredible. We had the chicken and beef paprikash with noodles, beer, pickles, and the amazing chocolate dessert. The owner treated us like family who had just walked in the back door (it was a slow night). We ate at a handful of other restaurants in the area and felt this was one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Delicious home cooking style restaurant! Our favourite is the wiener schnitzel and the chicken paprikash is delicious too. Service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant!  You must try this place.  Food is fresh, all home made and just amazingly good.  Food portions are huge and reasonably priced.  Friendly service too.  Can't say enough good things about this place!  Please support it!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch here with some coworkers.  Had their special of the day which was Chicken Cordon Bleu which comes with either potatoes or rice for ~$13.  The food was good and I was pleasantly surprised that the rice was nicely seasoned as well.  Could've used a sauce or something, but overall it was a tasty and quick lunch."}
{"text":"Absolutely outstanding- taste, portion, service, value. It's drab and a bit dark but this food- this food. THIS FOOD.

Had lunch today and there are nice looking lunch specials but when I see a Jägerschnitzel I have to order it, so I got the dinner portion for $18. Incredible deal given the size and quality. ABSOLUTELY the best Schnitzel I've ever tasted in Canada. Jägerschnitzel with the Hungarian version of Spätzle. Amazing.

10 minutes elapsed from my order to this gorgeous plate- two crispy perfect cutlets and a massive pile of Spätzle- arrived. I could not finish it, it was so ample. And delicious, and just everything I've already said in this review. One of my new faves, instantaneously."}
{"text":"We loved this place. The food was delicious and owner was charming. 

Avoid the routine and check this place out!"}
