{"text":"Go to the Keg. Trust me it's better than this.

First time here, my boyfriend and I decided to pick this place for our pre-Valentine's day celebration dinner.
I can tell you there is really nothing good but the environment is warm and cozy

We started with a dozen of PEI Melpec oyster, that no skills required, as long as they are fresh and didn't make us sick.
Then we shared a tuna tartar, our fav dish. 
According to our server, she highly recommended it over the escargot, so we did.

First of all, that THICK LAYER of spicy Mayo on top truly overpowered the whole light dish, and for God sake, don't know what the chef was thinking that spicy Mayo+ lemon+soya sauce goes well...?......on tuna,mango,avacado..???

Then I ordered a rack of lamb ($42) and he had 8oz steak ($42)....OMG, totally feeling RIP-OFF
I have never seen a rack of lamb which was fully  seasoned and still put a thick layer of gravy in the bottom in a \"fine dining\"restaurant. Same as the steak. The whole dish became very salty and I feel like a food court dish would taste better.
The steak was not tender but like a TV dinner, the gnocchi on the side was okay

I can tell you even that $8 lemon sorbet didn't taste good (tasted very artificial) and don't know why their cream brulee tasted like lemon filling.

The server didn't know much about catering, she was nice in general, but didn't know much about the menu. She didn't even removed our plates or the sauces when one dish was over. The tobasco sauce and vinegar from the oyster dish sat the table for the entire dinner

Now we saw some reviews saying they have changed new management, that answered everything.

 Go to the Keg. Trust me it's better than this."}
{"text":"New management, an extremely \"short menu\", old time favourites have been removed, the Pub menu is unavailable, their house hot sauce is gone..they have also become restrictive of alternating sides to set dishes? .. you lost me."}
{"text":"I've been to Hogan's Inn for brunch a few times now, and there really isn't anything in or near King City that can compare. 

Firstly it's great value for the quantity and quality of food you receive. $28 gives you all you can eat with a great selection of appetizers, mains, and desserts. 

The lobster bisque was outstanding, as well as the salads. My favourite main is a tie between the eggs Benedict and the corned bee hash, but you really can't go wrong with any of the choices. Finishing off with the Creme Brule or the Bananas Foster  closes out one of the best brunches you've ever had. 

Every brunch menu needs a good Caesar, and the one served here is just awesome. The garnish is almost a meal in itself, and it's not only beautiful to look at but tasty as well. 

The staff is very friendly, and I've always enjoyed myself there. It's my go to place every weekend for brunch, and I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved from Ottawa to King City this was our first date night since we arrived. We were greeted by  a charming hostess, the barman I am not sure of his name was amazing to say the least made me a great dirty Martini, and my husband had his beer while we waited patiently until the restaurant opened we were there at 4:45 Saturday the 28 of November the Christmas decorations were hung up with care the atmosphere super Romantic we sat in the Mackenzie Room. My husband had 10 oz steak and lobster, I had a 2 lobster tails shrimps, scallops along with their house wine as maritimer I can attest that my meal was deliciously beyond expectation my regards to their Chef! My husband finally had a meal that also met his fussy palate. We must Thank Sebastien for a magical evening along with the supporting staff that made the experience a success. I recommend this venue to any one who want to impress that special someone with the food atmosphere and special touch from the staff I give it a five on all aspects
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere in this old charming building. The server was great, she immediately greeted us at the door and sat us by the fireplace. The food was not that great. We ordered the fettuccine Tartufo (beef and truffle sauce) it tasted exactly how it sounds. We also ordered an antipasto plate for two. Cheese and meat you would find at your local grocery store. What really annoyed me was everything on the plate was cold! A nice antipasto plate should be at room temperature and the meat should be sweating just a touch. The dessert was a pecan pie (which had more of a pecan cake filling) and apple strudel that was mushy! It should be flaky! The best part was the vanilla icecream. It's a very cute place but the food was so bleh. I'm sure it's popular for ambiance and clients keep returning for their favourite mushy dishes."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and one of the most peaceful patios ever.

Okay, so it was probably just peaceful because we were there at three in the afternoon, but it was lovely to sit at the top of a ravine. The only thing that marred the view was the construction of a new retirement home on the highway. 

They have some local brews as well as your standards, and some tasty options for food. We split a chicken breast burger (the original chicken burger has cheese in it, so they subbed for a perfectly grilled chicken breast). This was super tasty, with some great soft bread and crunchy fries ($13). The service was very professional and quick enough without seeming lazy or obtrusive. 

If we're in the area again, we'll probably make it back here."}
{"text":"Great Mother's Day lunch! Salmon ceviche, lobster bisque and everything we ate is cooked sooo great! It's not easy to find a lobster bisque cooked the right way from scratch and we had it at Hogan's! Ceviche is something special as well!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend decided to stop by for drinks after work one day.  And we totally got blown away by their top notch service and delicious appetizer (we had the grilled calamari).  It was so delicious to a point i finished it all before i realize I forgot to take a photo :(  Their sangria was also very delicious, unlike the diluted ones out there.   I'll definitely have to come back for dinner so I can try more delicious food they have."}
{"text":"After staying away for a while my family decided to revisit Hogan's Inn since we found out they're under new ownership. We sat in the renovated upstairs bar area where the tables are a nice wood without table cloths so it's less stuffy and feels very cozy. I wish they would renovate the entire restaurant like this. It's really lovely. The service was good, maybe a little slow but the food was very good. We will definitely return and I'm glad we decided to give it another try."}
{"text":"Visited here last week. Ordered a burger w fries. Very tasty. The service is friendly and the place was quiet."}
{"text":"I had such a positive experience that I've taken the trouble to post a review on a few different websites. Great ambience and food, and a very courteous owner! 

I was really impressed by my experience at Hogan's restaurant. It's a really neat, historic spot that I don't think enough people know about. We met the owner who's a really nice guy and he told us that there's even a ghost... named Patricia! We're from Niagara where there are a lot of ghost walks so this was a really fun and intriguing story to hear about. 

Everything that my husband and I tried was really good. I'm a bit of a salad girl and I love that they offer 3 \"serious\" salad options at dinner. I always try the kale salad everywhere I go. I'd like to try the mushroom salad next time too which sounds delicious. My husband was excited to see Beef Bourguignon on the menu. A++

Don't hesitate to check this place out. Not just the restaurant -- the pub looks very lively too."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time last week with my friend. Overall, I was quite impressed.

We sat in the more formal area. I ordered the penne a la vodka, and she ordered their special of the night. I believe it was gnocchi stuffed with spinach and ricotta in a rose sauce. The food was excellent. My portion was massive, hers wasn't as big, but still filling. We also each got dessert. I had their chocolate truffle cake, and she got the creme brulee. We were both pleased. The truffle cake was quite large, I wasn't expecting such a big portion.

As someone who had never been here before, I was upset that they didn't offer us their pub menu. On my way to the washroom, I saw people eating delicious-looking pizza, fries, grilled calamari, and chicken strips. Although my pasta was devine, I would have liked to seen the other options. I'm not sure if there's a second menu, or if the menu is different according to where you sit, or if you just have to ask for the pub menu. But if I return, I'd like to try one of those pizzas!

PS: Pretty sure the upstairs level is haunted. That's where the washrooms are located. When I went up there, all the lights were off, and it was totally spooky!

Service was great, and it's not too busy, so you get attended to. The food also came out quickly!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Hogan's with family to celebrate my birthday. We went on a Tuesday so there were not many people, but the atmosphere was beautiful: cozy, intimate and historic.. just a beautiful place all around.
The food was great!! My husband and I both ordered the Heirloom Tomato and Buratta salad.. fresh house made cheese was the star... very nice dish. My mother ordered the tuna tartar.. while the tuna, mango and avocado are a nice fresh pairing, I do agree with a previous poster that the spicy mayo on top could have been left on the side.
As far as main courses; they were wonderful. I highly recommend the Chilean sea bass.. amazing. And you have to try the gnocchi!! Mmmmm"}
{"text":"They have their hours listed wrong, it says that they are open till 2am however they closed at 10pm,
I'm guessing they lie and do this in order to advertise their business online more.

I drove a very far distance and I was very upset to come up here and find out that they were closed.


If they lied about their hours, then maybe they also lied about other things, never trust a person or a company that lies.

I'm going to post the same review on TripAdvisor and more review sites/blogs."}
{"text":"Food was delicious atmosphere was nice it was with great company. We will definitely return wonderful wonderful little spot. Kids portions were very generous LOL I have never seen such large chicken fingers LOL"}
{"text":"I'm going to give Hogan's 4.5 stars.  
The bottom line?  The service is excellent, the food is very good, and the staff very accommodating.  Raza (I think that was his name) was professional, funny, engaging, and should probably be running his own restaurant.  He really seemed to care about our party, and was very quick to respond to anything we needed.  The space is very nice, especially the semi-private dining area at the back of the restaurant.  Just watch your head on that chandelier!

My itsy bitsy complaints?  We were given baskets of dense, beautiful bread with frozen pats of butter.  Frozen?!  Jinkies!  That was a bit of a bummer.  Those little plastic containers of whipped butter would have been better than trying to chop bits of butter to sit on the bread.

Also, the mussels weren't great.  They were okay, but I have been to bars that serve better mussels.  They were just too dry, more sauce definitely needed.

The rest of the food was incredible...and don't skip dessert.  It's really good."}
{"text":"I took my mom and my mother in law here for Mothers Day, and overall I am pretty happy. We were seated after a minute or two and our waiter was with us soon after to take our drink orders. We looked at the list and he recommended we have the pino Grigio.  So my mom and mother in law got each a glass. The wine was good, but it was expensive at $28 for two half glasses. The food came shortly after and we ordered calamari fritti, antipasto platter, and the caprese salad. The calamari was great, I really enjoyed it. The antipasto platter is for 2 people it says so he told me he couldn't do it for 3 people so I ended up ordering another one. It was good with grilled veggies, olives, 2 pieces of prosciutto, 4 pieces of salami. It would of been better if it had some cheese as well for the price. The caprese salad wasn't that great. I could make it better myself to be honest and it's not worth $19 for a tomato!!
We ordered carrot cake for dessert and Creme Brule to share and they were both very good. 
I found the waiter to be good, attentive, but not the best. 
He took his own tip off the top of the bill which if I had the choice I would not of given him $22 tip, but oh well. The bill was $153 for 3 people. I would come here again, I just would stay away from the wine, and I the caprese salad I wouldn't get again. I would order the calamari again for sure. I liked the ambiance, it was cozy but nice and bright inside with nice music playing in tht background. I would come here again, Just next time I would probably not order wine and I for sure would not get that caprese salad again."}
{"text":"Hogan's Inn King City is an amazing historical venue.
I came here for the first time today for lunch. I was immediately greeted and set at a waiting table which was beautifully set.

A lunch menu had both dinner and lunch options. Everything from burgers 2 steak we're available.

I ordered some oysters which were extremely fresh. Followed by a pear and arugula salad which was extremely fresh and tasty.

For the mains I tried the burger which was prepared on a a pretzel bun. And I tried the fish and chips which was a house better haddock.

Some of the other items which we tried was the pizza, tuna tartare, and a black card feature.

All the dishes were very well prepared and plated nicely.

The restaurant had an excellent wine selection that wasn't too extensive but had enough variety to go from a $40 bottle of wine all the way up.

Desserts were all House made and looked amazing.

I truly enjoyed coming here and I look forward is coming back for dinner in the near future."}
{"text":"Although I have frequented Hogan's Pub on a few occasions I had not tried out their restaurant.  In short,  I wish I had eaten there sooner. Service was great. Staff were very friendly, food was delicious. I had the Mussels in a white Pernod sauce Mmmmm! delicious! We shared a platter of grilled Calamari. Yes I know......I followed this with Pesce Misto di Mare (assorted grilled fish). Didn't realize the portions were so generous. Needless to say I over ate.

Yes I was a total Miss Piggy I had dessert .......Creme Caramel  and Hogans  take on Irish Coffee. Between the wine, good food, dessert I literally rolled out of the restaurant. Awesome foodn nice ambiance. only draw back there is little to no parking. Maybe thats a good thing, a little walk down the road helps to digest all that wonderful food.

Plan on going again. Now that I know the size of their portions I will definitely order less food."}
{"text":"There's very few places in Toronto (well the GTA) where u can go for an entirely unexpected experience.

Hogan's Inn is one of those few gems. Situated in a historic building built in 1851, the entire experience is transformative. As you enter, the restaurant portion takes you back to dining in the late 19th century. The menu is classic, with surf and turf staples, but has a modern flair to it. The wine bar is a great place to have dessert and catch up on some romance. The pub downstairs boasts the horse breeding history of King city, with beautifully exposed brick walls, live bands playing for the fun of old classic rock, and a great number of good scotches. 

Service is extremely comfortable and feels mature. It makes you feel like this would be the greatest local if you lived close by. The crowd is older, empty nesters and couples with adult children, but simply out to have a good time. It's very refreshing seeing people have a good time and dance just for the true love of enjoyment, as opposed to wanting to be seen or to make a statement. 

I highly recommend this place for a different night out. It's absolutely worth the drive (about 45 mins from downtown Toronto), but it would make a great anniversary dinner, special occasion, or anyone seeking a different experience. I go back regularly now and it somehow always make for a magical night."}
{"text":"Went to Hogan's to celebrate my brother inlaws birthday. The menu was good, the food was well done. We ordered the Kale and Arugula Salad, Beef Bourguignon, Cornish hen, salmon and a couple of seafood pasta dishes. The waitress was trying but is just not quite there yet, I'm with others about their need for training. The restaurant wasn't busy and when you have to peek around the corner to find someone and ask for something or wait extraordinarily long for water or napkins you've got a long way to go. The biggest problems I had were NOT informing us of the 15% tip that was automatically added to the bill for less than 8 or even 6 adults and the $21- cake cutting charge??? C'mon, charge what you want but be up front about it. This was a sure fire way to ensure we would never be returning no matter how good the food is. Kudos to the chef for sticking around, I'd have split a long time ago."}
