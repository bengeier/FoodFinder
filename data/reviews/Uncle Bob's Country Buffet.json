{"text":"I didn't expect much going into this restaurant.. typically buffets aren't that great & have mediocre food. This place was the opposite! The food was fantastic. It all feels \"home made. Great spot for comfort food."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Really recommend. Idk why people are saying the food lacks flavour. The food is great and the taste is too. It was my first time coming here and it won't be my last."}
{"text":"I think this a good all for the family restaurant. It's not bad for the pocket book and it has a lot of good variety of food."}
{"text":"Went there on July 24, 2017.  Opens at 5:00pm and we were there just after.  All food I tried was just lukewarm.  Some dishes (shepherds pie). We're not even put out. Told it was still in the oven.  Tried the roast beef.  Asked for medium however there was only one choice, well done and I mean WELL DONE.  O.k., went for dessert and guess what, it is now 5:45pm and many of the dishes had never even been put out namely, apple pie, apple crumble, sticky buns and struedels.  These are their best desserts.  A complaint to the manager brought some action and some other the items were finally served.  I must add we have been to Uncle Bobs a number of times and have been reasonably satisfied however this experience has really got me questioning whether we would ever return.  We are leaning toward a big NO!"}
{"text":"There's a reason they have you pay and tip before you're even seated. If you knew the disgusting quality of food they served and the lack of service you'd get, you would walk out without paying or tipping.   The food was lukewarm, dry, old, crusty, sitting in pools of oil, slopped all over the areas and definitely not appealing in any way. This isn't country food. This is garbage.   To make matters worse, if you complain, you get told, \"It is what it is.\" with a shoulder shrug.   We won't be back. Ever."}
{"text":"We have been several times.  The restaurant is clean bright and open. The staff is very friendly There is a good assortment of food though I would like to see them expand the salad bar and increase the items    Not a bad value for the price"}
{"text":"If you like simple American buffet food like I do you can't go wrong here for the currently lowered price of  $18 every evening INCLUDING  tax AND beverages. I believe it it $15 for lunch.  I have now eaten here 3x and I sense that the place is not doing well as I think the selections have decreased (no tomatoes in the salad bar!!)but if you are really hungry and want value for your money this is the place to go as the quality is excellent.  I also found out that this place is owned by the Mandarin and they have the same deal for free meals on birthdays with at least 4 people. They would be wise to let the public know as I think business is booming at the Mandarin now because of this practice."}
{"text":"Went with my family and all 4 of us ended up getting sick within half an hour of eating there will not be returning"}
{"text":"So, you need to fill a Zellers-sized void, huh?  Let's go buffet!  Brampton was sorely lacking a non-ethnic buffet restaurant, and we should thank Uncle Bob for opening up.  There is a large assortment of entrees, a decent-sized salad bar, and lots of choices at the dessert bar.  Coffee, tea, slushies and soft drinks are included is the reasonable price, $20 for adults. A solid B+, and I shall be returning! 3 minor details that management needs to address. Fisrtl, you need to adjust how much you make of an entr√©e at a time.  The fried chicken was dry.  You need to make less at a time, to keep the entrees fresher.   Second, I waited at the doughnut station, hoping for a couple, but three staff members were having a conversation that didn't seem to involve the customer waiting patiently.  Third, if you're going to serve Coke products, please add Coke Zero to the line-up!"}
{"text":"I am very open-minded, and I always grade a buffet restaurant \"on-the-curve\", knowing that I should expect a different standard of food quality and freshness because it is a buffet, and despite this, Uncle Bob's Country Buffet still managed to underwhelm.  Normally at a buffet, even if some of the food is questionable quality or freshness,  I can always find a few items that make me happy and I can base a good meal experience around those items.  Sorry Uncle Bob, it was tough to find any items on your lunch menu that I could get excited about, and there were a few items that were truly horrible.  The biggest disappointment was the fried chicken, an item that I previously thought was pretty hard to screw up, as I can really enjoy Fried Chicken from home, from cheap and cheerful joints, even from the Colonel! But Uncle Bob's Fried Chicken is weirdly quadrupled-breaded in some bland anonymous doughy mess that tasted like nothing, and delivered only a terrible doughy-chalky texture. The Shepherd's Pie, also hard to screw up, was deeply screwed up.  The best item was probably the barbecue rotisserie chicken thighs, they were nothing special, but they were certainly edible. And I didn't hate their not-quite-Taco-Bell-quality tacos, nor the spaghetti and meat sauce with meatballs, all of which were not at all \"Country\" and a little unusual (sweetened meatballs?) but not entirely horrible.  Even the soft-serve was bland and icy, with the sticky toffee pudding being the only semi-likeable dish on the desserts side.  All in all, everyone in my party agreed, we were completely unimpressed.  Uncle Bob, you are no Golden Corral Buffet, and even \"Mother Tucker's Mediocre Marketplace\" has nothing to worry about."}
{"text":"Came for lunch 10/01/17. Usually I give them a 5 star rating. This time I was disappointed and had to give a 1 Star. Food wasn't cooked properly, fried chicken had blood on the bones. Staff was at a min. Near closing for Lunch all  Staff eating no one at their stations. Urinal flooded all over the floor told front desk they ignored me. I had to go back in and almost slipped. Never going for lunch again."}
{"text":"Heard mixed reviews from my brother but received a flyer mentioning new management and a promotion (ie HST included), so we finally decided to give Uncle Bob's a try.  Family of 4 (two kids under 12) for a Sunday dinner was under $60. Everybody found something to their liking. Not a single bowl/plate of wasted food. Emptied plates were cleared from tables promptly. A wide food selection at a reasonable price.  Pros: Fountain drinks included. No tip expected. Surprises: Cotton candy.  I'm guessing management reads the reviews because the fried chicken was moist and not overly battered as someone else wrote. Keep up the good work, we'll be back."}
{"text":"we went for  the brunch buffet  Not bad for the price but it was not the greatest quality.The bacon was way too salty"}
{"text":"The price is great, especially for a weekend buffet, but even the great price did not compensate for the lack of quality of the food.   I read reviews that this place had good fried chicken.  Well, the fried chicken I got was raw on the inside.  Even if it weren't raw on the inside, the taste was nothing special.  They did not have any chicken wings.  The bacon was really hard, I'm not sure how they could mess up bacon.  The ribs were also hard and too sweet.  They had a salad bar that did not look fresh, but it tasted average.  I did enjoy the stir fry fish and the onion rings and fries.  I think because they were the usual Cavendish fries and onion rings.    Everything was oily and not healthy.  The worst thing was the smell of garbage as  you entered the place and right beside the dessert table.  They had cotton candy, but it was hard to enjoy given the rotting smell.  The buffet includes drinks such as slushies, pop and coffee.  It's a good deal, but the coffee was really watered down.  I did enjoy the cream of broccoli soup though.  It was very creamy and that's how I like it.  The concept is great and before I came here, I could not imagine how they could have messed it up, but the smell of garbage really sealed the deal with the negative rating.  The place is pretty big and can accommodate a good party size while feeling like you have privacy.  Come if you value a low price for a buffet, average or below average food, a big space and can handle the smell of garbage."}
{"text":"I think it is pretty good for the price. I visited on Friday and the variety was really good. If you don't like something, you still have many more options. I loved the breaded chicken wings! I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place has a unique concept.. reminds me of when I was in the states and had buffet you pay first before eating which I believe is a good way so customers don't worry about the bill after.  Service and staff they are very friendly and watch the customers to make sure their table is clean or if they need anything.. the lady at the register has a very warm presence she's smiling and has a very friendly tone.  Food wise it's COUNTRY FOOD so lots of fried and hearty dishes j love their corn bread and fish and chips.. taste of the food is on point their food doesn't need any salt seasoning is great of you like hot sauce with your food you just have to ask the server. They have salads soup tacos pizza pasta poutine fried chicken. Unlimited hot drinks coffee and tea and fountain drinks.  Layout of the place is nice have all of Canada's Providence  we were seated in Manitoba.. ohh they assign your table for you which is coo.. overall i would definitely come back here again good buffet place and something new"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday evening. Pay before you sit then you are given a table number to locate and seat yourself. Drink station is also self serve. You also need to grab your own cutlery and napkins.   Selection was decent, although quality was lacking. Most dishes were average, with the notable ones being the self serve tacos, fish and chips, meatballs, pizza, and sausages.   Not so great dishes: - Alfredo pasta - sauce was very bland - lasagne - good flavour but was way too soft, borderline mushy - fried chicken - nice crunch but lacking flavour  - mac and cheese - bland with no real cheese taste  - grilled steak - although not burnt, it tasted burnt to a char. The grill must not have been cleaned in quite a while.   Dessert: - apple pie - yummy  - sticky toffee pudding - good flavour except it's missing raisins and is not as moist as it should be.  Overall, a solid tree out of 10. For $19.99 + tax with drinks included, I can't complain."}
{"text":"For the price and for what it is (your basic all you can eat American food), Bob's isn't bad and definitely a welcomed addition to Canada. In the US a similar place would be Golden Corral, though Bob's isn't quite as good.   The food at both of these places isn't of the best quality but reasonably good. What you get is a variety of pretty good food for a very good price. To expect much more isn't really all that reasonable.   The rotisserie chicken is tasty. The fried chicken isn't bad but the batter could use more seasoning. It was a little slow on my visit so the food wasn't cycling through very quickly. Coming at busier times could help to ensure fresher food on your plate.   The warm rice pudding satisfied the sweet tooth quite nicely!"}
{"text":"If my \"uncle\" served me food like this, we would no longer be family... Honestly I had high hopes that were shattered by the salt and mundane, lacking flavours of the dishes. Corn/Polenta muffin were good, fried chicken was decent. Pasta was horrible, but the worst was the Sheppards pie... it was absolutely disgusting. Eggs were oddly crusty and bacon overcooked. The only dessert I had was the bread pudding,  it was the only saving grace for this abominable display.  Their selection is far too limited, but there is promise if they improve the quality of the dishes offered."}
{"text":"I've been dying for this place to open!  I was checking their website more than I'd like to admit to see when it would say \"Now Open\".  Alas!  The time has come.  It's been awhile since Brampton had a non oriental themed buffet. Actually I'm not even sure if we ever had one in the first place but anyways, I finally came here on a Monday night for my gf's bday.  They make you pay upon arrival (kind of like buffets in the states) and you are assigned a table number in a province.  They do have many food options and they're all very hearty.  I got full quite fast.  I won't comment on everything I tried but I'll talk about the stand outs and the not so greats.    STANDOUTS Roast beef was ammmazing!  So tender and full of that roast beef flavour.  My friends all agreed it was amazing.  Corn bread was surprisingly good.  When I grabbed it and touched it on my plate I thought it was going to be dry and hard.  To my surprise when I opened it up, it was perfect.  Perfect texture and flavour, not hard at all.  This is a country buffet, of course this should be on point! I really enjoyed the spaghetti with meat sauce.  That was one that I could keep eating and eating.  I wish I tried more but I'm kind of a waste at buffets since I can't eat much lol.  They do offer you 3 different kinds of pasta and 3 different sauces, meat sauce, alfredo and tomato sauce.  Sticky toffee pudding was yummy.  I hate pineapples but the upside down pineapple cake was really good.  That tells you something.  The mini donuts were ok, but I bet they would be better when they're super fresh and hot.  THE NOT SO GREATS Poutine and pizza were too salty.  Cauliflower soup was also too salty, according to my friend.  They make steaks to order, which is amazing. Don't know any other buffets that do this.  Unfortunately, it wasn't that great, but what do you really expect? I didn't love it, but my friends found it to be ok.  I thought it was a little dry and obvz not the best cut.  Although, I mentioned some delicious desserts above, their dessert station is REALLY lacking.  How do you not have cheesecake?!  Is it not country enough?! Ok, I'm calm, but really.  Their ice cream machine was also broken on our visit.  Like c'mon!  Ice cream is an essential part of a buffet experience (for me).  They offer 3 flavours of soft serve.  Strawberry, chocolate and vanilla.  The only flavour working was strawberry (which is the worst flavour to me lol).    This should go under \"standouts\" but the gentleman clearing plates, Devono, was amazing!  i really hope the manager is reading this, because that kid is a keeper.  Very polite and hard working.  He was the only one I saw clearing people's dishes all evening.  He was always coming around and even cleaning tables as soon as patrons left.  He was genuinely grateful when we tipped him.  He deserved it! When you pay upon entering, there is a prompt on the machine to tip.  I declined this.  I believe that the tips should go where they are deserved.  Devono definitely deserved it and I hope he got to keep it all.  Although there were some cons, I will return.  I'm glad I got to come before all the hype begins and the place starts to get rammed.  There are a lot of other things I'd like to try and other food I'd like to come back for!"}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations when I came here. But as soon as I walked in, the design and the organization was very eye catching. It had a very comfortable atmosphere. The food items are very delicious. They had a variety of foods from salads to making your own pastas to poutine!   The service was very good. The only thing different about this place from others is you have to pay before you can enter and eat. They don't charge tips or anything like that also.   I would definitely revisit as this place was very good! I would recommend this to a friend. As for pricing, on a weekday afternoon, the total was about $50 for 3 people."}
{"text":"I'm a picture person so before coming here I looked through all the photos posted on Yelp and it didn't really look super appealing to me.  I also read a lot of mixed reviews, from good to bad ones.  With that being said, I didn't really come here with high expectations.  Price for dinner was fairly cheap, 19.99 plus tax without drinks.  The food was alright, it wasn't the best quality but the flavour was there.  I did like their mac n cheese, it wasn't dry and it didn't taste like they cooked it from the box. Their ribs are good too, fall off the bone and super saucy just how I like it.  They also have slushies and cotton candy, so for those with kids will definitely like this place.  I did hear they're going to open up a location in Mississauga.  If they do they're going to need to step it up a notch as Mississauga has a lot of great restaurants to eat from.  I'm not sure if I will be coming back, food wasn't the best and it wasn't memorable enough for me to return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is completely serve-yourself.  You pay up front and are directed to your table.  The buffet has alot to choose from and most of the food is pretty good.  It's a great place for families.  My family has finally found a restaurant everyone can agree on."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Everything looked like frozen entrees and veggies that were warmed up. The food was cold. 19.99 was way too expensive for frozen food that wasn't even hot. Will never ever go back"}
