{"text":"A real Korean non-bbq experience. This place is geared towards a younger crowd who like spicy food and is willing to try new things. 

PLEASE DO NOT WEAR NICE CLOTHES HERE. The type of food and the so-so ventilation means that you will be walking around with the aroma of spices after you leave. This is the kind of place that you go eat, go home to change/shower and then head out for a night of partying. 

I think there might be 10 tables in the entire restaurant. It stays busy, have been there multiple times on both weekdays and weekends and it is always close to capacity, so please book ahead. 

By far, my favourite item on the menu is the spicy pork bone soup (first item on the soup menu). It is a delicious soup with 3-6 pounds of slow cooked pork on the bone (depends on if your order the 2,3 or 4 person size) in the soup. Warning: this dish is messy and you will have to use your hands to eat it. 

If this is the first time you have tried eating like this in public it can feel a little awkward but try to get over it. Almost every other table in Don Day will be eating this dish in the same way. 

Other than that, the spicy calamari is very tasty and well prepared, just cooked to tender without jumping to chewy and comes with a large portion of veggies. 

All in all, this is a wonderful place to go with some close friends for a great meal, even if the table manners wont impress a date."}
{"text":"There is no side dish. It is not a restaurant. It is Korean bar. Not good for meals. Food wan't bad. Wasn't salty."}
{"text":"This place is literally a hole in the wall. Situated next to the infamous Sketchy Mac's, it's not somewhere you'd give a second thought to. Lucky for you fellow Yelpers, a few girlfriends and I had dinner here and I survived to tell you the tale!

Probably thinking more with our rumbling stomachs than our heads, we ordered the following: sweet potato noodles, crepe, tofu soup, short ribs and spicy rice cake noodles.

For those who have never been to Don Day, it is reaaaaaaaally small inside. There's maybe 4 or 5 tiny tables surrounded with Ikea stools so you're not in there for comfort. When all our food arrived we had to stack the plates just so everything would fit on the table. 

I think we got a good mix of everything, different textures and flavors. I will warn you that Korean spice is something not to mess with; the soup and rice cake noodles were \"OMG, I think I'm dying\" hot and no amount of water will save you. Just cry and keep eating.

If you're feeling adventurous (seriously it's not that sketchy in this area! Go as a group if you're concerned) and check out Don Day for some delicious Korean food."}
{"text":"Tip: it's a very small restaurant only have 12 tables about 35 seating. Try make a reservation to reserve a table. 

 Delicious traditional Korean cuisine. I recommend order an appetizer egg roll and hot pot. I'm not a spicy food person, I told the server and chef to be mild spicy. But still the spicy hot pot was at medium level of spiciness. Services was very good too."}
{"text":"Been here maybe 4x in total and all I can say is, I love the authentic Korean feeling and food, ambience, etc.. despite the waiters' limited English ability, the pork potato soup is good. Altho I see only a few potatoes on it last time I visited. I always order that with spicy pork stir fry and a side of rice. I heard the chef learned his skill whilst in the army. I like the owners friendliness but as what other yelpers suggested, they should provide side dishes as I only recall a minuscule green salad for a side when I went there. Sketchy place indeed coz it's right by Mac's but it's worth the trip regardless of the hardship in finding a parking space."}
{"text":"very odd experience weird place but excellent food"}
{"text":"Very very bad service. We went to this Korean restaurant tonight and ordered a large pot, when the lady opened the gas cooker, the gas was explosive burning. The fire is so closed to our face, but nobody hurt luckily. They didn't apologize to us and just ignored us, we waited beside at least 5 mins and they served another new group people came in , it seems they forgot us. 

This restaurant is so dangerous, the chair is unstable, and the gas cooker is easy to explosive burn, the most important their waiter didn't know how to operate a gas cooker in right way. We won't come in again."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive at first, the restaurant looks like some illegal shop. But we decided to be brave and wow - what a find! The prices are excellent and it has real character. Everyone there looks like they are having a great time - just a little place with hotpot and pictures all over the wall. We tried a tofu and pork soup with rice, and a Korean pancake. Tasty stuff!"}
{"text":"PROS: only Korean restaurant that was open past 11. The kimchi soup was very sour = Imo very good and shows they actually use old kimchi for the soup. The restaurant gives that izakaya vibe with BIG tables. 

CONS: the restaurant is hidden around the building. And it faces the c train."}
{"text":"Can a restaurant be good and bad at the same time? This one can. My Korean bbq pork bulgogi was good, lots of tasty meat over veggies. My friends mild heat level  squid and pork dish was fluorescent red with chili and inedible. The waitress, who it was difficult to communicate with, would neither comp the dish or ask for it to be remade. She insisted on being paid every penney for it, including the tax which she had not broken out on a handwritten bill. As we left I told her again the chef should have remade the dish. No reaction."}
{"text":"After traveling in Korea, I am always in search of authentic Korean restaurant. I should highlight the fact that I am looking for both authentic food and ambiance. Don Day hits both targets :D . This joint is a true whole in a wall hidden behind LRT lines. The opening hours is somehow random and  you should try your luck if you are in the neighborhood (Officially 5pm to midnight).  

As soon as you enter the restaurant, you will feel like being in Korea. Almost no English sign and no English speaking customer which is always a good sign for me. Also, it is not the cleanest restaurant in town which again reminds of typical restaurant on Seoul :D. 

We ordered the spicy pork and squid with rice(30$ enough for 3). The food arrived in a big skillet raw which was placed in front of us on the hot burner to cook. Also to wash the spicy food down we ordered Suju. The food was super spicy but the type of spicy that you like to keep eating. What I recommend to do is at the end of the meal, dump a bowl of rice on the hot skillet to soak up all of the juices. The rice will also create a crust which in my opinion is the most delicous part of the meal. 

So next time you are in downtown looking for some adventure I highly recommend this place. If you are patent enough to get over the first impressions the food will surprise you in a good way. I will definitely go back there to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Holy Lips a burning batman! Korean food ravages my taste buds. Prior to my experience with Don Day Korean, I had only ever really sampled Korean BBQ - delicious, meaty and easy on the spice. Don Day however, was a much more authentic joint. They had to rustle up one of the few english menus for me and my friend, and though the restaurant was full we were probably the only non-Koreans in the joint. That was cool actually - I knew we must be getting the true food experience. I did not realize that meant tons and tons of spice.

The joint itself is a small place off the side of the 7th avenue train station, and is also right beside the \"Crack Macs\". They have wood boards in the windows so we actually thought it was closed before we tried to go in. The wooden slats actually serve the interior decor quite well - it is fairly small and contemporary with a definite Korean spin. 

Now, looking around we saw a lot of good looking dishes - a group of five were dipping into a Korean-style hotpot (I do not know names). We were a little less hungry, so opted to try some of the soups. Scanning the menu revealed a lot of dishes that sounded interesting. I would love to go back, but am unsure if my taste buds will survive it. Our waitress warned us before we ordered, and so I got a soup that was described as mild. It arrived steaming hot, and I loved the mix of flavours that I got before I began feeling like my lips were swelling and about to fall off from the (spicy) heat. My friend - who is much more resilient to the spice than I - quickly finished her soup, and sampled mine and told me I was being wussy.  I just couldn't handle the heat."}
{"text":"So question, is Calgary's Don Day have any association with Edmonton's Don Day? Same name, same cuisine, same good food, I see a pattern developing here. Then again, maybe not. We went to check out Don Day Korean on a Saturday evening. First thought - this place is authentic Korean. 

Ghetto chairs? Check. 
BBQ grill on the table? Check. 
Soju? Check. 
Korean pop videos in the background? Check, check, check.

We were seated right in the corner (by the door) which surprisingly wasn't too cold during our meal. They have hooks on the wall to hang your coat (smart) and heat lamps overhead to keep the place warm and cozy. I like the setup and humbleness of this place - this definitely would classify as a hole in the wall. Just a very chill place to grab some filling, delicious Korean food and drinks. It seemed like all the customers were Korean too! Reminded me a bit of my time in South Korea.

They have some specials up on their chalkboard but there was none for Saturday (weak!). My buddy had a few tips on what we should order so we went with that:
- Pork bone soup ($37.50 for a large) - spicy pork bone soup with potatoes, vegetables and roasted wild sesame seeds. This dish was absolutely massive.  Tons of pork meat and flavour in this bad boy. We probably didn't need to order a large but there were five of us, so technically speaking, it was reasonable.
- BBQ pork shoulder ($29.50) - thin slices of pork shoulder (no marinade) with lettuce, garlic and hot pepper. Don't worry, this was about half of the meat picture below.  They also brought us out fresh lettuce wraps and Korean chili sauce to make our own little meat sandwiches, if you will. Love Korean BBQ!
- Seafood pancake ($15.99) - mixed seafood and green onions. We all were in agreement that the pancake was lacking in depth and flavour. I've had much better elsewhere, skip it.
- Spicy soft tofu stew ($11.99) - spicy stew with soft tofu, seafood, egg and vegetables. This one was nice and spicy, not to mention piping hot. There's something about soft tofu that is delicious and comforting at the same time.
- 3x Rice ($1.50 each)

What else can I say? Sweet spot located right in downtown Calgary with good food and a relaxed vibe. I know there's lots of good Korean in town but this one hit the spot for us. Worth a try."}
{"text":"First off, do not wear a jacket that can't be washed in here. LOL!! The constant cooking from the portable stoves will cook that smell right into the fibres!!

Anyway, I really like the pork bone soup here. I really wished they served hot tea though. I hate how small the place is and having to sit on tiny little stools. If you're looking for comfortable seating and good atmosphere, do not come here. If you need a quick bite to eat with big portions, it's a great place to be."}
{"text":"The food here is sub-par. For the money the portions you get is very small. We ordered chicken and was given chicken heart meat. Most dishes have more onions than meat.

Overall, the price at this place is in line with out restaurants, but you get less food and eat in a poor environment. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got the stir fried pork. It was spicy and delicious!! Ordered it to go-service was good"}
{"text":"Automatic one star for not being stabbed or robbed. This place is right around the corner from the Crack Mac's, and admit it, you knew exactly where I'm talking about. 
The most I can call this place is \"an experience.\" 

There's at most 10 tables, 8 of them that only seat 2. I came with a group of 4 and they were reluctant to seat us. Upon realizing none of us spoke Korean, service was impossible or near non existant. It felt like they were taking our orders anyway just to get us out asap. I've had my share of eating at hole in the wall places and usually they are really good experiences and I'm sad to say this isn't the case. 

Food? Was good, admittedly, but quite pricey compared to other places. Portion size was decent, and there is quite a selection. That's about their only positive. 

The establishment itself is tiny and unventilated. Extremely casual, wood tables with sheet metal tops, flimsy aluminum task chairs that are extremely uncomfortable to be on for more than a meal's session. Air quality just plain sucks, and everything from walls to floor is slick with oil and grease. 

What would it take for me to come back? Well I'd have to bring a Korean date, a sterile suit and gas mask, and no self respect. Boo urns!"}
{"text":"This place is a total dive. Dirty walls, floor and ripped up old greasy stools with poor lighting. If this sounds like were you'd like to enjoy a meal then here it is. Don't get me wrong there are dives with amazing food that will make you overlook the terrible setting. However this is not the place. With the poor ventilation and constant cooking, your clothes will smell like everyones dinner that night. 

Service was friendly and food came out quick. Maybe if we had another dish it would have been better?"}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall, but not in a good way :(. First let me say that I have relatively low standards for fanciness of a setting. I am that friend my friends have to slap away food I'm trying to salvage according to the five second rule. But Don Day looked really run down on the inside. Even though I love holes-in-the-wall this place's stools were falling apart and the place was tiny in a cramped way. I had bibimbap as always but it lack lustre. It was the kind of vegetarian bibimbap that is basically just rice + what is normally a side dish + an egg. Speaking of side dishes, there were none, which is another big con for me because what is Korean food without the side dishes?? My friend had the giant ox bone soup which was definitely meant for two people. There wasn't a lot of meat on the bones though so I feel like you're mostly getting broth and bones. I don't know a lot about the value of meat but I'm pretty sure that's not really worth it. If you're downtown and looking for Korean food, I recommend going to one of the several options in Chinatown instead."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect going in, but we were welcomed by friendly staff and I was immediately put to ease. The food was delicious and our server was constantly refilling our tea. The only negative was the very cramped and uncomfortable seating."}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
Ambiance: 1/5
Service: 5/5

Pretty bomb-a$$ pork bone soup! This place doesn't win many points for their décor or cleanliness with its wobbly tables, worn-out stools and dirty walls and floors. I can ignore these facts because the pork bone soup is that good. The \"small\" comes with 5 dino-sized bones that you gotta get down and dirty in to get all that juicy meat off. In addition, we ordered the spicy pork and a  side of rice. 

Only thing lacking is that this place doesn't give you the complimentary side dishes which would've been a pretty sweet addition to an epic meal."}
{"text":"STEPH JUDGEMENT: Decent bunsik (casual, inexpensive Korean food) in downtown Calgary.

This place was right across from our hotel so we decided to check it out for dinner on our first night in Calgary. They don't have a huge menu, but it has a lot of the crowd pleasers. More limited if you're a vegetarian, like my bf. We ordered:

Corn cheese - sweet canned corn, gooey cheese, yum
Chap chae - we thought this would be veg-safe, but alas part way in the bf found little tiny bits of beef in it so I ate the rest
Steamed egg - kind of an egg souffle, quite good

We also got some Korean beers and soju to go with the meal and overall it was quite satisfying. The crowd was mostly young Koreans and had a fun, casual vibe. There was only one waitress working but she was efficient and courteous. This place in LA's ktown would be just average, but was an unexpected treat in Calgary."}
{"text":"Fast service and I love the food I ordered. Washroom smells clean but looks weird though. I enjoyed my meal and staff is really quick but understand a little English only"}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall korean restaurant with delicious pork bone soup but mediocre korean food otherwise (japchae and seafood pancake were forgettable). The place has very little ventilation so don't bring all your fancy clothes there or you might walk out a bit smelling a bit different. I might go back for the soup on a cold winter day."}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of Don Day.  I always told anyone who wanted to have good authentic Corean in Calgary, to go to Don Day over any of the usual Corean BBQ suspects (Koreana, Seoul BBQ, Bow Bulgogi, Korean Village).  Instead of trying to be everything for everyone, Don Day is more of a tavern for folks who want to drink soju, get loud while eating pork intestine and have some stew.  You will likely smell of the food when you leave and I dig it like that.  Perfect conditions for a cold night in Calgary.

They were best known for Gamja Tang - (), which for the uninitiated, is a hearty potato pork bone soup.  I say that in the past tense, because in my most recent trip to Don Day it was pretty lacking and downright atrocious.  The Gamja Tang lacked the most basic ingredient: potato!  For non Coreans, Gamja () means potato.  I asked the waitress, where's the potato?  She replied, \"sorry, we don't serve with potato anymore.\"  What?  You can't be serious.  How can you serve Gamjatang, without the Gamja?  She just shrugged and walked to another table acting like I never asked the question.  

So we proceeded to eat the only thing that was served with the broth:  the pork bones.  Now if you've had gamjatang, you'll know that the meat should tender to the point that it falls off the bone - otherwise tough meat on bones is extremely difficult to eat.  Well guess what?  It was tough.  So tough that we literally had to leave the meat to simmer in the broth for an extra 15 minutes before we had to pick up each bone and eat with our hands.  Even then after sacrificing most of the broth to simmering, the meat was so tough that it wouldn't come off using chopsticks or the spoon.  Despite using the messy hands and cheeks technique, so much meat was wasted left on the bone because it was simply unreachable and uneatable.  

We also noticed while gnawing away that the staff was wheeling in boxes of potatoes.  HELLO.  NOTHING ELSE ON THE MENU USES POTATO EXCEPT GAMJATANG.  WTF.  If you've run out of an ingredient, you should at least let your customer know so they can choose to either order something else or at least know what will be missing in the dish they ordered.  Don't pretend like you just don't serve Gamja in Gamjatang \"anymore\" and then wheel in a shipment of potato...  You're liable to lose a customer and have them write a bad review.  Oops, too late.  Oh and the bathrooms can be simply described as sticky and wet floors with dust caked ceiling vents.  I honestly didn't care about that before but might as well go full disclosure with this review.  

There's lots of Coreans in Calgary now.  Why is it so hard to find decent Corean joints in Calgary?"}
