{"text":"Great food. Good price. Not the type of place to dine in with a date but I'd do take out again for sure"}
{"text":"Just discovered this great little place. The service is friendly and fast and the food is fantastic! The sticky rice in lotus leaf was amazing and the kids couldn't get enough. The wings were crispy, fresh and flavourful. The Cantonese chow mien was great and the chilli jumbo shrimp was the hit for us.  Highly recommended and we found our go to Chinese spot near the rouge."}
{"text":"Yum! This place just opened up and it's DELISH. They have takeout and amazing lobster and chili shrimp!!! I'll definitely be coming back. The staff were really friendly. Best Chinese food in the area!"}
{"text":"We moved out to this area about three years ago and have tried every Chinese food restaurant we could find.  We stumbled across this one via Yelp.  Finally, I've found some really good hot and sour soup.  And the owners were really lovely and comped us an order of sesame balls filled with bean paste.  Prices were very reasonable and the food was very good.  This will be our go-to Chinese food place from now on."}
{"text":"We ordered a large order for delivery at 640pm it is now 9pm we have called multiple times and still have not received our food"}
{"text":"SS kitchen has recently been replaced by Great Wall Kitchen and the quality of the food just hasn't been the same."}
{"text":"Fresh food. I ordered the Cantonese chow mien and shrimp fried rice and they were delicious. The serving was generous so great value for money. Yum definitely will come back to this hidden gem in rouge hill."}
