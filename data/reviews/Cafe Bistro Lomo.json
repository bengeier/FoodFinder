{"text":"We wanted to go to a place near by, which was totally packed in we wandered around just to find this place. We headed in and the place was empty, totally undeserved. It has couple of comfortable chairs that invite to lounge, but also several tables to sit and stand. The walls are decorated with many Lomo pictures. The menus were hand made with many self made pictures and showed like the rest of the place a lot of appreciation for detail.  We had Wonton Noodle Soop for lunch, a home made mango cheese cake and a large latte. Everything was excellent. The service was friendly and fast. A nice place!"}
