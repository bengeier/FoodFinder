{"text":"It's been in business since 1952 and I'm fairly curious how it survived this long.  Take a look around at the clientele and you'll see the average age (at least during the lunch hour) is late 70s.  I'm sure most of these people have been coming here for the past 50 or so years but I can't understand why or what's bringing them back.  First off, this place needs a big time face-lift.  The decor is completely outdated.  The chairs are light green/turquoise plastic, closed back, on wheels and look absolutely ridiculous.  The service was pretty good though although they never offered to refill my empty water glass.   Secondly, the food.  The menu had a ton of fish dishes on it but I was pretty nervous about ordering seafood from here.  I went with the daily special, fish and mac.  Hard to go wrong with fried fish, right?  It was overdone and some parts were all crust and no fish which isn't what I go for.  Also, they don't give you lemon which I thought was odd.  The mac and cheese was better than expected and had some breadcrumbs and herbs but was still pretty bland.  The meal also came with a roll and butter and a side of coleslaw.  The coleslaw was the best part of the dish.  All in all, I feel like this place is a local, family run Eat'n Park.  You can get better food for equal money a lot of other places."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the previous review.   Restaurant decor is completely out of date. The rolling chairs are ridiculous and get in the way of the servers.   Asked for vegetarian soup, they served my cauliflower soup with chicken broth and small bits of chicken. Of course, I sent it back after my server questioned if I was confusing cauliflower with chicken. Uh. I've been a vegetarian for over 15 years, I know the difference and my stomach proved it 30 minutes later.   My cousin ordered scallops and fettecini alfredo...He got one (1) scallop. The server said that if he wanted additional scallops it would be $2.75 per scallop.   All of the food was bland, but, not unusually for this area (Sewickley). If your from somewhere else other than Western PA, don't waste your time or money. If you're from Western PA and over 50 and have been going here for the past 30-50 years, more power to you."}
{"text":"This is the type of place that hasn't replaced a booth or a chair or put up a new picture on the wall in 30 years (and, that's a good thing!).  I had a bite here yesterday while in a quick business meeting at my colleagues' suggestion.  The place screams old school.  In fact, I think when I walked in I cut the average age in half.  There are two entrances, one for the bar the other the dining room.  We entered through the bar at a little after 4 PM and the place was already pretty packed with mostly retired folks.  I'm guessing this place does pretty steady bar business all day.  I also think people were smoking, which I'm guessing they can get away with because of seperate entrances.  We were sat at a quiet table in the back dining room. The chairs were really comfy, old worn in pea green swivel padded chairs.  My grandparents would love this place.  The waitress came over quickly.  It's clear she was a pro and probably had been waitressing for 40 years.  I can't report that much in detail on the food, but I can comment on the couple choices that we had.  I had a cup of surprisingly good coffee.  I then ordered a cup of chile that was really good, definitely homemade with cheese and onions topping.  She also brought out some good crusty rolls (not warm, but not ice cold) served with butter (no fancy dippin' sauces here).  Frank ordered a bowl of what looked like good french onion soup bubbling over with cheese and then we split an order of stuffed hot peppers.  I really enjoyed this dish.  It is a classic and hit the spot'.  The peppers were hot but not tears flowin hot.  The red sauce had a nice sweet flavor and it balanced the peppers well.  The sausage itself was good quality and abundant.  Overall the cost for a nice light meal was $20 for soups, app', bread and coffee for both of us.  Definitely a better choice than Panera for about the same cost.  I'll be back and may bring gram' next time."}
