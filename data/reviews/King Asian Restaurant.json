{"text":"Honestly I cent hate on king Asia for their convenience factor. They serve alcohol and their food is decent. Its a sketchy place with sketchy people serving but its somewhat cheap and the hours are good so all together you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I come here for take-out and I think it's the cheaper and much much better alternative to Manchu Wok. Food portions are generous and not greasy at all. Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent takeout asian fast food. Everything is about 5-6 bucks. I really was skeptical when I walked in, but their pad thai was fantastic! Will definitely make a trip again, better than Noodle Wok on Burnhampthorpe in my opinion. You can sit in but honestly it is a bit dingy. Located in the busy Dundas/Hurontario area. I ate my portion for 3 meals, servings are HUGE."}
{"text":"I order from King Asian regularly. I don't eat animal flesh yet still wanted to enjoy their General Tso dish. I requested if they could make it with tofu and they did! It's crispy, tender on the inside, and saucy. Excellent! Keep up the good work. This is our go to for reliable and tasty Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly people and quick service.  Standard good Chinese take out for when you are in a hurry. You can also eat in if you want but don't expect fine dining."}
{"text":"Ordered here a few times and usually its decent, cheap prices for good greasy portions. Last time however, i got the sweet and sour pork over white rice and when i picked it up, the rice underneath the chicken had black mushy blotches all throughout. Almost threw up after my first bite."}
{"text":"Solid North-American Chinese food. 

Me and my SO order from here every once in a while. The food is consistently very good. We usually get the eggplant, chop suey, vegetable fried rice, sweet and sour chicken balls and/or shrimp, general tso chicken and lemon chicken. Food arrives pretty quickly and is always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"The place could use a good cleanup but the food is decent and they do late night delivery. The won ton soup here is great. For 6 bucks you get a huge portion with a good ratio of won tons, meat, and broccoli. Definitely one of the best options in the area."}
{"text":"Well, i just returned from here with some takeout.  I was in the area and though i would grab some Chinese food to go, but with my past experience here i had second thoughts.  Well, i placed my order with the very loud person at the counter, a dinner for two with a side order of honey garlic ribs.  I sat down and realized hey, it looks like they cleaned the place up a bit. They must have spent 10's of dollars on the transformation.  However its still disorganized as ever with storage in plain view of the customers and the constant chatter barking from behind the wall.  Then i knew my order was ready......  Perfect.  Got my order right and Got it to go, and for two of us, its not bad for the price.  It was hot, tasted fresh, not like blow you off your feet fresh but good enough to satisfy.   I've been here before and usually the restaurant is kinda gross but this time as i said, they cleaned it up a bit.  Not enough to entice me to actually take a seat and eat there, but they are getting better.  They have come a long way this year. There is still hope they can be a contender in my quest for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"Ordered two separate times on two separate days, and two separate dishes using Uber Eats. 

The first order was Szechuan noodles with chicken, and an egg roll. Order came quickly, but the presentation and taste of the food was atrocious. The chicken looked old, and smelled the part. Did not eat even 1/4th of the meal. 

I ordered a week later giving them a very courteous 2nd chance hoping that it may have just been an off day when I initially ordered, plus my usual spot was closed for the night. 

The second order was Beef and Broccoli with steamed rice and an egg roll. The beef smelled off, and tasted the part. The \"meat\" actually disintegrated in my mouth. I tossed the second meal as well. 

I will NEVER..EVER order from this \"restaurant\" no matter how hungry I may get at midnight. I'm surprised this place isn't shut down. 

If you're reading this and you order from this place, you should try China China Palace on Bloor and Dixie. Now THAT is an incredible restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had! I ordered 6 items and they only gave me 2....
Not only that, after I told then they missed 2 dishes and 2 soups they yelled at me! My father ordered the black pepper beef and said it tasted like it was rotting, and when we told the cashier she started yelling saying it's our fault that we ordered it! Not to mention the \"vegetarian\" soup tastes HEAVILY of pork fat! And the poor fish sitting in the front in his tiny dirty tank is a heartbreaking visual! I would NOT recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"I got the rice noodles with chicken and shrimp in curry. 
There was barely any curry and the chicken just looked off and not much chicken was even in the dish.  I got this HUGE TRAY of a portion.. which is a great bang for your buck but wth am I gonna do with all this food that is just \"meh\"! I feel like my meal was such a waste of money.  
The chicken wings.. Yuck! Too much batter I couldn't eat those either.  
Also... MSG??? Usually i can eat a decent portion of food but after a small plate of a few bites and I got full really fast! 
Not ordering from them again. Quality of food not the greatest."}
{"text":"I walked in this place with my daughter, after a few years having not eaten here in a while. Needless to say the place is still the same which is something one can appreciate in a small joint like this. However one thing we noticed as soon as we walked in, was a foul odour. This was very off-putting and it was combined with the odour from the sickly looking goldfish on the counter. Poor little fella. Lol. So we casually looked at each other and gave our \"code nod\" with our heads, to exit. We opted not to order from here. This place does not appear to be very clean. With all that said the food could very well be tasty. Take your chances."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Looks beat up and is located in a bad area, but the food is amazing. The Lemon chicken, chowmein, rice, everything I've ever ordered was great. Lots of food for a small price and it's good too for Chinese junk food."}
{"text":"The food here I will admit is great SOMETIMES. Last time I order Chicken Fried Rice it was basically rotten BUT what is worse is their customer service, it is disgusting. If you order on the phone they change the price as they so choose. They have insulted me on the phone multitude of times and if you actually go into the store itself it is DIRTY. The owner himself is very rude and the lady is even worse and she has insulted so many people even in store. Their company should be closed down because they don't know how to treat people at all.

If I could rate it in negatives I would..repulsive customer service and haphazard food. After 2 years of ordering from them I will NEVER order from there ever again"}
{"text":"Ordered here from uber eats as my usual chinese delivery joint was closed for the night. The yung chow fried rice was the only edible dish out of the 3 things I ordered. The hot and sour soup was delivered cold and tasted like feet. The salt and pepper shrimp is basically heavily battered tiny shrimps with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, still dripping in the frying oil. 

This is my first and last time I will ever order from this establishment. There are far better priced & tasting chinese joints all around the city and I refuse to spend my well earned money here!"}
{"text":"I use to frequent this place while working close by. I always thought of this place as offering an inexpensive meal with good value.  Recently I went there and I was disappointed.

I ordered a sweet and sour dish with rice. There was barely any meat in the dish. The pieces of meet were mostly bread and fat that was fried. I'm normally a person who finishes whatever portion I'm given but this was a time I ate less than half of it and put the rest in the garbage. Even the rice was just too salty to eat. I feel sick eating here today. I would not recommend this place anymore; it is sad. If you must eat there, avoid any breaded menu options."}
