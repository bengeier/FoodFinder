{"text":"First visit after the change from the original owners.  Kept the decor, tinkered with the menu (kept the crispy beef tho, so all is forgiven), and a vastly improved wine selection.   We did a la carte, but look forward to exploring the AYCE option."}
{"text":"First to review! Visit here tonight (Apr 16, 2018) and realize it's the first night under the new name/leadership.(They forgot to remove the \"closed\" sign as well!)  The food is just amazing! Lots of sushi and Thai food options, they even present the Japanese BBQ like the Brazilian ones to the table for you to choose. Food quality is very good and the plating is just amazing! Can't believe they plate like this for one piece of sushi in AYCE place. Keep up the quality and definitely gonna visit again when I'm around."}
{"text":"We dined here for a graduation celebration with a party of 21. We did the all you can eat sushi and were super impressed with the menu options and the service. Excellent touch with the Japanese BBQ/grill that came to the table every so often with delicious cuts of steak, bacon wrapped chicken and grilled shrimp. Great ambiance and decor add to a wonderful dining experience. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My all time favourite all you can eat place. I was a little scared when it switched from JJs to Wind but I was not disappointed. Star items are the salmon tataki, chicken satay, pumpkin soup, glass rolls and crispy beef. The servers also come around with items on skewers. Service is prompt and courteous. BIG PLUS: wind now offers dessert. Unfortunately they ran out of the creme brulee and coconut cheesecake the night I went but I'll definitely be back to try them next time!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous! My husband and I met up with 4 of our friends. My husband and I just came from my grandmothers birthday dinner and just wanted to hang out with a friends since we don't see them very often. So it only makes sense that my husband and I would want to get a la carte and my friends are having all you can eat. The management told us that we cannot do that. If my husband and I want to have a la carte we have to move our table and sit separately from the rest of our friends. That's just absolutely absurd why would I come to spend time with my friends just to sit at a different table. I've never in my entire life been to a restaurant that has this ridiculous rule!!! I definitely will not be coming here again. I've had much better food at other restaurants that allow friends to sit together no matter what they order. This made us and our friends feel very awkward. It made us feel that we were being treated like second class citizens and not customers. I'm pretty sure that if we were the same race as the people working at the restaurant we would be treated much different."}
{"text":"I had been to this location a few times when it was JJs. The interior hasn't changed at all since then.  Wind's menu also seems the same as previous restaurant. Which is fine, I liked the food anyways. At $30 per person for AYCE sushi, I was pleasantly surprised by the things that made it different than other restaurants.   They had the servers walking around offering additional items like at a Brazilian steakhouse. Of course, they were the slower moving, less expensive items in an effort to fill you up. But that's ok, I understood what they were doing and appreciated the effort anyways. Besides the pineapple was pretty good.   The presentation of menu items was exceptional. Whether in large sushi boats or delicately placed atop decorative leaves. It all looked great.   Additionally, the food tastes great except for a few items. I had ordered a roll wrapped in cucumber, no rice. Can't remember name of it. The eel in the roll tasted off and entirely too fishy for my liking. Otherwise the roll was an excellent idea. The crispy beef was a good idea as well, good use of beef scraps. However, some pieces were so small they ended up like beef jerky.   We will be back to explore more yummy items on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on Sunday at noon and the place wasn't busy at all (we stayed till 2:00). It's on the price side at $21.99 for the weekend lunch AYCE buffet. You are given the option to have the dinner buffet at lunch if you want to order their sashimi and specialty items. I've been to the Wind location in Niagara Falls and was hoping for a repeat in terms of food and service - unfortunately it fell flat.  The rolls were on the bigger size and had quite a bit of rice, and the seaweed that it was wrapped it was chewy and soggy, not crispy or fresh. I don't know how long the wasabi was put on the serving dishes, but it was dried out with a tinge of brown when we got ours. The beef used in the cooked beef dishes were either too chewy or mushy, the texture was definitely off. The mango ice cream didn't taste like mango and the mango mouse was too runny.  I did like how there were 3 types of shrimp dishes - shrimp tempura, rock shrimp and coconut shrimp, all hot and crispy. The sushi were served on a wooden boat. The salmon sushi was ok. Even if you order a single item, the plating was done artfully. The servers were relatively attentive.  In my opinion, there are better AYCE sushi buffets in Mississauga, this will be my one and only visit here."}
