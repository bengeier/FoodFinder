{"text":"Excellent food, quick delivery. The 'mild' was more accurately hot (I don't say that as one of the weak tongued) but still full of great flavor!"}
{"text":"Great buffet, excellent service. The staff are very polite and professional, even when kids are being raucous. The lunch buffet has lots of choices and is a great value. I'd go here once a week if I lived closer."}
{"text":"My friends and I had been frequenters of the former Maharaja for years. Found out it changed hands and became Tandoori House so we went over Friday afternoon to give the lunch buffet a try. Arrived around 1, the place was pretty empty. Think there was only 1 other table seated the entire time we were there. And once we tried the food itself, we knew why.  The selection was pretty standard to what you'd expect at one of these buffets. I of course got some tikka masala, my go to, and tried the lamb curry, and a few other things I cannot recall the name of. I took my first bite of the tikka, and spit it out. It was like taking a shot of salt. Everyone else did the same. It was inedible. At least 3 of the other dishes were just the same, the only flavor was salt. Overpowering loads of salt. And on top of that, they had the heater on the buffet set really low or even off, if they food had been any cooler I wouldn't have even tried it, for sanitary reasons. One of the managers stopped by to ask  how the food was at one point, and I was honest with him. He did offer to have a batch of \"low sodium\" tikka misala made up, which came out piping hot. And while it certainly wasn't the salt bomb that the stuff on the buffet was, it was completely bland.  It seems a strange turn around from the \"wasn't salty enough\" comment here from 2 months ago. And I know the business is still new, but you'd think they'd have the recipes in tip top shape after 2-3 months."}
{"text":"Amazing Tandoori Paneer, best I've ever had.  Super flavorful spice rub combined with the tandoori char to produce something out of this world.  The vegetable curry was also excellent.  Service was a little slow, but friendly and accomadating.  I would highly recommend this place--food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICE, TAKES FOREVER. The order took more than an HOUR AND A HALF to arrive! They'd told us 45 min for delivery. In addition, it was really expensive considering what we got. Over $32 for literally one entree (shahi korma), 2 orders of naan, and 2 tiny samosa. They only provided one small packet of rice. We were calling for half an hour to check on the status of the food, but no one ever answered the phone. We'd ordered the food mild as our toddler doesn't like very spicy food, but it was extremely hot - perfect for me, but not at all what we ordered, and our kid couldn't eat it.  When the delivery finally arrived, the delivery guy wasn't even apologetic. I was standing at our open door waiting, and he was walking so slowly, like he didn't even care. Unfortunately we'd already left the tip, and they charged us a delivery fee on top of it, without disclosing it.   This is a business that is obviously NOT equipped to provide delivery service. The korma was good, but nothing else was."}
{"text":"Under new management, I didn't realize they were there until we were invited to dinner with friends.  Great lamb tandoori and nan, enjoyed with authentic Indian beer. All 4 at the table enjoyed their meals immensely, and we were able to specify the exact level of spiciness we wanted. Quite enjoyable. We'll be recommending it to our friends."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the complaints are about. I really liked the food but most of my meal consisted of 2-3 dishes only. I wish they had palak paneer but instead there was a lamb dish with paneer. It was good. I'm a goat fan so the goat curry was also good. Give it a try and see for yourself. Disregard our Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"We had been here previously when it was a different restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised with the new menu. Many dishes we weren't familiar with.  The flavors of the Shahi Korma and Jalfrezi were unique and delicious.  The Naan was soft and flavorful. The staff was very friendly. The only drawback is the decor which feels a little stark.  Concrete floors and bright lights. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were hungry for new flavors and so we tried the Tandoori House and were not disappointed.  We were served delicious, fresh  handcrafted drinks and enjoyed the intense flavors and fresh, hot dishes of chicken curry and beef tandoori.  The naan was crisp and hot out of the oven and the staff was attentive to our needs throughout the entire meal.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Having eaten Indian around the country and overseas, I never expected such quality in a strip mall. We had 5 different dishes and each was exceptional. The ingredient mix was spot on and some combinations unique (salmon masala). I'm also sensitive to over salted food and over powering spices but had no post meal overeating regrets! A bit more work on style and this place could be even more welcoming as the staff were carefully attentive. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went to the lunch buffet with a friend and the food was so good I returned with my wife for dinner soon after.  My friend had lived and travelled in India and also felt the food was unusually good.  There were lots of vegetarian entrees, two types of naan, a very good lentil soup and tasty desserts.  The pickles (condiments) tasted fresh and flavorful.  Coming back for dinner, we shared the vegetarian dinner for two, which featured three excellent entrees, papadam, pakoras, naan and dessert.  The portions were generous and the use of spices skillful.  There were good choices for Indian beer.  This is now our favorite Indian restaurant by a wide margin."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with friends. Excellent drinks made special for us by Jimmy.  The food was wonderful. I loved the Roghan Josh and the Goat Malabar. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Local demographics who are not very aquiented of this type of ethenic food consider awesome, but who grew up eating curry and kabobs it is just a mediocre restaurant.  $11/-  buffet is just little too much for cold food.  Dish trays were not attended and some were empty. No one was looking after buffet trays. Middle of lunch hour resturant was empty, meaning good seating without any wait.  I guess i was expecting better food with newer management. Older restaurant charged $7/- with better taste."}
{"text":"Done with this restaurant.  My husband and I have been coming here for a long time and order the same thing every time and the order can not seem to be consistent.  Tonight felt like we threw away our money again.  For $42.20 for dinner for 2 you'd think we could at least get our take out in containers that weren't cracked open and spilling all over.  When our order is correct, everything is there, and the containers aren't busted open we like this place but we can't seem to get that consistently.  Also the pakora and shahi paneer recipes must have changed recently and I don't care for them anymore.  The paneer was very hard and the new spice/flavor wasn't as good as it was.  The pakora are now chewy, bland and taste overcooked.  We had issues in the past and the staff addressed them promptly but again we had our extra rice missing, bad pakora and shahi paneer spilled all over.  Madison selection of Indian Restaurants is growing constantly and I won't be coming back here.  Friendly staff and very good food sometimes."}
{"text":"So I was a bit shocked to see Maharaja was replaced, and I went in to their lunch buffet to compare (with a skeptical pallet). I don't understand why some people said it was worse than before, I thought it was fantastic! Pretty much the exact same menu and selections as before, except it seems to be even a little bit better, but I just can't put my finger on why.   I'm a big eater; I always get my money's worth. I tried almost everything at the buffet, it was all as good as if not better than Maharaja used to be. I'd definitely say it's a step up not a step down. Don't fear change, it's not a bad thing in this case!"}
{"text":"The Shahi Korma and Buryani were excellent. Some tandoori dishes need some work. Decor has been changed. The service was outstanding"}
{"text":"This place went totally downhill after the change of ownership. Every time I've ordered delivery, they've either not been able to find my address (and then just went back) or they totally screwed up my order. But the absolute worst was finding some sort of metal string in my curry. It's really a shame because it used to be one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Unbelievably good Indian food for an upper Midwest town like Madison. I travel a lot and always eat at Tandoori House when I'm in Madison. The food is prepared beautifully and It's well seasoned without being too spicy. I've dived in and ordered delivery and the quality is always high. I also appreciate a good halal option, which can be difficult when I'm not in a big city. The staff are friendly and it has a family vibe. Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"So it's a little confusing. Google Maps says Maharaja Restaurant is permanently closed, but Tandoori is at the same location and shares the same website. Aside from that Tandoori is a great place to go for Indian. The Lamb Curry was delicious and perfectly spicy at medium temp. The Chicken Shahikorma had nice chunks of bell peppers and was also perfectly spicy at medium. The one issue we had was the Chicken Shahikorma was lacking in sauce. Honestly though, the service was great and we look forward to going back to Tandoori House."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner as this place has been around for quite sometime known as Maharaja. It's gone completely downhill unfortunately. I was with family (5 other adults) and my one month old daughter. We were seated quickly. My order was wrong but I didn't say anything to the waiter because my daughter was starting to fuss. I ordered chicken tikka masala and some other kind of chicken was served instead. The food presentation wasn't up to par and the quality of food wasn't great either. The waiter was rude about my daughter fussing even though we we were on our way out. Not a good place for children, rude and inaccurate service along with poor quality food. Spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came to this establishment when it was still Maharajah and after this visit, I find myself wishing I was back at Maharajah. Don't get me wrong, it's still cheap eats for lunch for all-you-can-eat! It's not that the food is inedible but it's just not super yummy anymore. On the day we came, lunch time ran until 3pm. We got there around 2pm and most of the chafing dishes were either half empty or practically already empty. It didn't seem like they were going to refill anything because they were getting ready to close at 3pm.   Of all the things I ate, here are a few that hit the spot: The chicken tiki masala had a really good sauce but the chicken was super dry. We really liked what looked like a blood sausage; it was full of spices (not temperature wise) and good. The garlic naan that they brought out was hot out of the oven and fragrant with the smell of garlic. Very good! The best thing I think I ate there was the spicy chicken (it's red and reminds me of Chinese sweet and sour chicken).   The staff that we encountered with were very happy, polite, and attentive. That is something I can vouch for! The restaurant is also very clean, but the food has left to be desired."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get lunch buffet, they have discontinued it. Have a different lunch menu. At least 6 people came in and walked out because they asked for buffet and there was none. Anyhow, ordered the veg thali and the meat thali. Food is subpar. Didn't look like the traditional thali you would expect at most Indian restaurants. Chicken and daal and rice and salad. Over cooked tough chicken. Very disappointed. Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"Contrary to a previous recent review, today when we arrived the \"lunch buffet\" neon sign was on and they did indeed have a lunch buffet available. Salad, fruit, dal, and an average number of hot dishes (10-12, including chicken tikka masala) were available on the buffet as well as two dessert options (mango ice cream and kheer). A basket of hot naan was also brought out to our table. The dishes were okay but we would have preferred more (or more pungent) spices in all of them. We liked the goat curry, dal, pakora, and samosa. There are certainly better options for Indian food in town, but on a Monday in this vicinity it was an alright option. (The fennel seeds on the way out were great though)"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly attentive service, good food. Free papadoms. Everything I tasted was good: chicken pakora, papal paneer, garlic naan, mango lassi."}
{"text":"Good authentic Indian food.. Visited for the first time.. Hadn't heard much about the place.. Buffet was pretty good and had lots of variety.. Specially liked sik kabab and dal makhani.."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious. being a stay at home mom who has to cook 3 meals daily. there are times when I dont want to cook at all but have to as there was no resturant which delivered halal and delicious desi food. Thanks to tandoori now I can take a break from cooking and spend more time to play with my kids. So far I have tried chicken tikka, chicken achari, peshawari kadhai, samosa chat, daal makhni, and chapli kabob.  everything was very delicious with pakistani taste.  and yes how can I forget ghulab jaman...veryyy yummyy.  now i dont need to wait to go to chicago for pakistani food. I can get it here from tandoori house. I wish they add pakistani style biryani to their menu."}
{"text":"Totally recommend this place. Plenty of \"Indian\" food options around Madison, most of which offer a very similar menu and flavor. These guys pulled in some different recipes and flavors from Pakistan which makes it worth a visit. Solid service as well."}
{"text":"I have absolutely no complaints!  I really appreciated the menu; there were many choices and My Indian favorites were on it. I ordered Palak Paneer and Chicken Makhani to-go and it tasted as it should!  The staff was friendly and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"The owner was so nice! I ordered my food Togo and he recommended the chicken tikka masala. I caved and got it because who can resist. The meal itself comes with a good portion of rice, tikka massala, and dessert. As much as I liked the portions, I wasn't able fully get the explosion of flavor I was looking for. The rice was plain...which i was looking for something more fragrant and the actual tikka was creamy but missing that pop. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. However, you should definitely try the mango smoothie if you go. I'll be back for convenience, but isn't my first choice."}
{"text":"Different name but still great food. Ordered off the menu for dinner and were very pleased with what we got. The chicken makhani was rich and delicious; the tandoori beef had a nice bite to it and a smokey flavor; and the garlic naan had plenty of garlic. Loved the chai tea, too. We treated very well; given extra bread and refills of chai. We'll be back next time we're in Madison."}
{"text":"Gave this place a shot before I leave Madison. I found the food very bland or lacking flavor. It wasn't bad..but not very interesting either. Palak Paneer is usually an easy \"yum\" but this stuff was flavorless. Maybe the food is healthier or more authentic than other locations? I'm not sure. It was consistent throughout the food. Probably the best part was the naan bread when it came to the meal. Service and prices were fine and the selection was fair for the price."}
{"text":"By far the BEST north Indian food in town. I am giving a 5 star rating because 1. Food was delicious and authentic 2. Prices are very reasonable. 3. Both Buffet and the regular Menu have a lot of veg and non-veg options 4. Staff is friendly and welcoming. 5. Clean environment and good location.  Their Grilled Fish and Chicken Tikka Masala are my personal favorites, I prefer their Buffet over other Indian restaurants as they keep changing the menu."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant many times over the years and have always enjoyed the food.   However, since changing their name to \"Tandoori House,\" they have reduced the size of their lunch buffet significantly, and food is not replenished once emptied. Very slim pickings really, and no mango ice cream! They've also done away with the warm gold, red, green interior. Instead they have painted the walls a prison color beige and replaced the dark carpet with standard issue beige tile.   Did I go to the prison cafeteria or an Indian restaurant?   The staff was very nice, but they did not offer any kind of drink other than water.   Sadly, the underwhelming food and stark, ugly decor equate to a deal breaker. There are many other Indian restaurants around Madison that bring their A game in all categories.    All those wonderful pictures you see of the buffet tables and the warm colors on the wall are long gone from here."}
{"text":"It was my first time coming to this restaurant. My wife and I really liked the service. We were seated promptly and the buffet had a good variety of dishes. Overall, we were very satisfied with the service and the food. We will come again!"}
{"text":"From what I've read, this used to be another restaurant that switched cooks and changed its name. When I initially looked at the reviews, most said that the past restaurant was better and that the restaurant lacks ambience.  Tbqh that may be true to some degree. The restaurant was very large, empty and had no music. The waitstaff seated me promptly and had good service.  when I go to ethnic restaurants I usually go for good food and I thought the lunch buffet had pretty good quality with lots of variety.   The curry was very flavorful and some were actually spicy, which I really like.  The only dish I didn't like was the goat curry. The meat was very chewy and hard to eat, but I did like the flavor and consistency of the curry."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!  The best Indian food around.  We had the goat curry, mixed tandoori, mango shrimp and chicken Makhani.  The makhani was so good we had to get an extra order to go.  They make great drinks from scratch - mango margarita was so good!! I was very impressed with the service as well.  I travel often and eat out a lot at high end restaurants and the service here was top notch. Very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The interior decor went downhill since the change from Maharajah (tore out the carpet and painted the concrete floor? Really? Why?).  The food on the lunch buffet was lukewarm, had no sneeze guards over the chafers (I thought those were required by law?), and there was not a good selection of items.  I won't return."}
{"text":"Use to be my favorite buffet. New name + new Managment +!less good food + not good service = let's consider somewhere else for lunch!"}
{"text":"Went here after realizing that Kangchen is closed on Mondays, and was curious to try the \"new\" Indian restaurant for their lunch buffet.  Bottom line is that there's nothing new here that you won't find at any other buffet in town, and although it's a self-perpetuating problem, the lack of customers meant that the food was mostly sitting out rather than being refreshed and looked old and was not terribly warm.    So... is it bad?  No.  Would choose to go here for lunch buffet again?  No."}
{"text":"My friends and I came in on a Sunday  for my birthday dinner. We were seated promptly and very friendly. Our server told us about the drink specials.  I had a margarita and a cocktail he chose for me. Sweet, spicy, and delicious with oranges, limes, tequila, and tamarind. Our food was hot, with great flavor and large portions. The menu was accommodating to my vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free friends. We were given a complimentary birthday dessert that fed all of us. We were very impressed with the staff and quality of food. I'd highly recommend Tandoori House for a fun get together with friends! Thanks for a fun birthday meal!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely outstanding. I came into town for a business trip and thought there was no good food in the area.   After a quick yelp search, I saw this place and thought I'd check it out. To my surprise, Tandoori house was a Pakistani/Indian fusion restaurant. These are very rare to find! I had the Peshawari Kabab with saag paneer. It turned out to be a rest experience .  Both owners were present. One Indian and one Pakistani, which showed me exactly why both choices of my dishes were so good! Naan was on point and fresh as well.  I would recommend this place to anyone. Just wish they had more places like this in my hometown.   Thank you for the great food and service tandoori house !"}
{"text":"This was the biggest disappointment since Toronto....food was cold for starters and we arrived at 11:30 so it should've been stellar fresh.  There was crust on the saag paneer and the tandoori grill fish was cold like it had just been brought out from the refrigerator.  The naan was average at best and even the water had a peculiar taste to it with oily film on top.  The only good thing I can say was they offered a box of \"Kleenex\" next to the chai tea as you left the buffet area so you did not need to blow your nose in the white cloth napkins.  The price was $11.00/ person but we were charged $27.43 for two with no extras. Never again... trust me don't go here. Sorry Tandoori House but you need to change  things and fast."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food is definitely good. Eating at the lunch buffet I got to try a good variety of things, and all of it was pretty darn tasty.  I was let down by the chai tea, there was not very much flavor in it at all. Sadly it was more brown water than anything else. Didn't get any other drinks so I can't speak for them, the rest may be good.  The atmosphere of the restaurant isn't enjoyable currently, though this is mainly due to remodeling they're doing I think. There's not really any decorations on the walls, so apart from the tables the rooms feel empty. But again, they're currently remodeling, so this will likely improve over time.  The waiter felt very awkward and almost confused. And I don't think I'd put it to him being new to waiting tables. He had the motions down so to speak, but he didn't seem to know what was going on. We asked if we paid at the table now or on the way out, and he didn't seem to know. After a long pause, he said it was paid at the table, but he sounded very unsure. And throughout our interactions with him, there was never a spark of personality.  So comparing it to Maharaja, which it took the place of. Is the food better? Maybe some of it, yeah. It's the same if not better. The chai is worse, though the rest of the drinks may still be good. The atmosphere currently is a far cry from Maharaja. Empty walls and lack of any decorations make it feel unenjoyable and less fun. It lacks the charm that Maharaja had. And I can only speak for one waiter, but comparing him to the waiters of Maharaja, there's no contest. The waiters of Maharaja had fun personalities and were nice and very attentive, even at the lunch buffet where they're needed much less. The waiter I had seemed like he'd rather be anywhere else.  The three stars are because the atmosphere, and staff will likely improve over time. And the food is already good. It has the makings of a great restaurant that will stand on its own and not need to be compared to its predecessor. When that happens, it'll be a 4 or 5. But right now it's just average as it's food is held back by the rest of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The too long didn't read version of this review is \"I miss Maharajah\". That's not the reason for 2 stars, but it's still true.   We went for the lunch buffet because we're just wild about Indian food. The place didn't really have a large amount of people, and we got there shortly after open (11:30 am). You'd assume the food would be fresh, but you'd be wrong. Everything I got off the buffet was lukewarm at best. The fried things were soggy and greasy. The flavor was ok, but you can get better pretty much anywhere in Madison. The buffet is also very small. They also do not serve naan to the table, it's in a hopper so it's sad and limp not crispy and awesome.  I think outside of the food the thing that bugged me the most was that I did not feel welcome at all. The two guys who were serving us talked only to my husband and one actually walked away as I started talking to him. He asked how things were, listened to my husband and walked away while I was talking. When I went up to pay, it was basically the same thing. Looked and talked to my husband even though I was paying.   I don't need to return here."}
{"text":"The chicken tikka masala meal is pretty good but the entire paper bag from the restaurant (especially the naan) smelled heavily of cigarette smoke.  The naan was completely inedible due to the cigarette smell/taste - it was really disgusting especially in terms of taste...  Even though the taste of one dish from the restaurant is good, the cigarette smoke smell/taste that has transferred to the food is just unforgivable."}
{"text":"This is now were Maharaja used to be. The new owners must have new chefs as well. The food was terrible.   Very bland tikka masala and chicken curry; every thing needed more salt or something. The tikka masala had way to much cream in it I could barely eat it. Even the nann was cold and tastless.   My favorite thing to eat at most Indian restaurants is the mint chutney, dipping for nann, pakora and samosas. Most places the taste is very similar, sometimes different color or texture but still tasty. Tandoori House's was beyond awful. It was again bland, super spicy from tons of raw jalapeños that it almost tasted chemical-like.   The samosas were also empty from the time we got there until we left. Maybe it will get better with time but I'm not willing to take that chance. We will not be coming back here, Swagat off of Old Sauk will be our go to Indian buffet from now on. Also weird how the other 2 reviewers have only started yelping this month and have only reviewed this restaurant? Just sayin....."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Monday night and ordered the chaat samosa appetizer, potatoes and spinach (aloo something) and malai kofta. The hot food was hot, especially the bread, and beautifully spiced. You can order hotness from 1 to 5. My companion is not a spicy girl and found 2 too hot. But my kofta tasted milder to her, perhaps because of the paneer in it.   When we were ready to go the waiter offered rice for the spinach leftovers, no charge.   There are several vegan and vegetarian options on the menu."}
