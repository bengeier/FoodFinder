{"text":"This place inside Woodside mall has been here for years. Came here quite a few times 17 years ago but probably haven't been here in over 6+ years.

Had the large noodle with rare beef and brisket. The noodles were nice and the broth was very tasty. The meat portion could have been a little more generous, but overall it was a very tasty and not too heavy meal. 

Prices were good. $7 for small $8 for large. Only accepts cash and debit. No credit cards"}
{"text":"Most of my friends really like this place, but i think its just alright. I guess the good thing about it is, it isn't too oily and the food is  oK."}
{"text":"I love vietnamese food but this one; just a waste of money. Ordered combo for $18 plus. Gave us the wrong order twice. Soup not good;not tasty. Meat entree came so fast; u would think they cook it already and heat it up as you order. Will never come back. That is the worst vietnamese food i have ever tasted."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for about 25 years now and my parents used to bring me here when I was 5 so my bias will probably show in this review. Their beef pho is absolutely the best I've ever had up to this day and age. I always get my pho with the thin rice noodles, but be careful their default noodle type is the THICK RICE NOODLE so make sure to tell your server which type of noodle you want. 

My second favourite dish is their beef stew, and that honestly warms my soul during the cold Canadian winter. The beef stew comes with beef brisket, so if you don't like the fat part of the beef make sure to tell your server you want your beef lean. 

The staff here are very friendly, and will do everything they can to accommodate your requests for example changing noodle type, more noodles, more rice, etc. 

All in all this restaurant is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant and I was very fortunate to have been brought here by my parents as a child. I tell the boss lady to never retire but I know that is selfish of me and unrealistic . Hopefully someone will take over and run the place in her place"}
{"text":"Delicious food, prompt service and the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.

I just can't say anything bad about here, because everything is truly perfect.

I can safely conclude that this PHO restaurant is the best out of every other location I've ever been to.

A+++"}
{"text":"We've been going to Woodside Square for years now.  My husband and I thought we'd try something different and go this restaurant.  I am happy we did.

We sat down and someone helped us right away.  They quickly gave us tea and gave us the menus.  They have two menus which was kind of confusing.  We ordered the Special Combination for Two meal for $17.00.  This combo included Spring Rolls & BBQ Pork with Vermicelli BBQ, Chicken and Beef on Rice, BBQ fish balls and 2 free drinks, we chose a pop and the Mun and Red bean drink (I loved this drink!).  We loved everything but the fish balls... The food was delicious, BBQ fish balls where okay but I've had better, tasted as tho the balls were frozen.

We will definitely come here again.  :o)"}
{"text":"Been here twice with my bf and each time we order the beef with rice which also comes with a sauce on the side. We ordered the mango milkshakes as well so they were quite tasty and not too overpoweringly sweet! I enjoy the way they cook the beef and it goes so well with my rice and the sauce - especially once you mix the charred parts of the beef with the rice mmm very good!

The service is pretty quick and tables will clear just as fast so no need to wait here. Will definitely come back here again for that same dish with a different drink but the only set back is I wish they had a TV so we could have all watched the World Cup! Haha!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Been coming here every other week for a couple years now and we love it!

The owner and staffs are really nice and recognizes my family and I by face now. They always give us a warm and friendly greeting and food is obviously great! It is my favorite  go to pho place because they serve fresh rice noodle. The soup broth is clear and flavourful. 

The only flaw about this place is that they don't serve everything listed on their menu, such as bun Bo hue, sinh to mang cau(just to name a few of my faves). 
Which is why I had to deduct one star from my rating.

Overall, I personally think the location at steeles/yonge is better but unfortunately way too far."}
{"text":"So sad to say that we won't be eating here ever again.  We have been coming here every week, sometimes twice a week, for nearly 2 years.  The last time we went was on February 20th, how come I remember the date so clearly? Well it's my daughters birthday.  My daughter always gets the fresh noodles, we all eat the dry ones.  We ordered as usual and because it's rare that our orders are ever wrong, my daughter went ahead and put her beansprouts in her bowl of pho.  Then she stuck her chopsticks into the bowl and noticed it was dry noodles.  The lady boss and a waitress walked by and asked what was wrong.  I informed them that my daughters bowl had the wrong noodle, the lady boss just said, she's put the beansprouts in already and wouldn't change the bowl.      She then noticed that I was pissed and offered me 10% off our bill.  We have been regular customers for such a long time, how much would it cost to change the small pho?  It was their fault, we had ordered correctly.  I paid the full price and will not be returning ever again.  Good job we found a much better place, last week."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, and the pho was good, but the rest of the food were quite average, the pork chop was too dry, the fried wontons weren't tasty at all...  overall I will only go back for the pho and the service of the nice lady!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant location for my whole life actually. This restaurant pretty much set my high standards for pho. As a Vietnamese/Chinese Canadian, this is truly the place to go to if you are in the mood or craving for pho ! Service is excellent, there are a lot of menu choices with reasonable prices!  Obviously, you have to try their pho, they have many ways and sizes you can enjoy your bowl of pho. Their are many other menu items to try like their rice dishes and vermicelli dishes . If you are only trying Xe Lua for the first time, the one drink you must consider ordering is their hè au õ, Xin Xáo, Nùoc Dua (Red Bean, Grass Jello with Coconut Milk & Ice), the perfect drink to compliment your meal ! You will not regret coming to Xe Lua, still one of the most authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the GTA !"}
{"text":"Amazing, just amazing I believe that this restaurant is the best around. I've tried pho restaurants but none of them serve there spring rolls noodles as good as they do. I've tried their new restaurant and its even better. Can't find better prices for authentic Vietnamese food anywhere."}
{"text":"This place has been here a while so surprised it wasn't listed on Yelp. Broth was good, a little oily but good portion size and great noodles. Large menu and great speedy service. It is part of my regular pho restaurant rotations."}
{"text":"1.5/5, +.5 for service

Xe Lua used to be better. Significantly better. I used to frequent Xe Lua when I attended Saturday school at Albert Campbell; I would just walk across the street and into the restaurant most Saturdays. I stopped coming here when I stopped attending Saturday school, but I decided to return last week since I was nearby.

Service was very good the entire time, and honestly if it weren't for the service it would've been a one star for me. The waitress honestly attended me the whole way to a point that I was quite satisfied with her service.

The food, however, was a different story. I ordered the beef brisket with tomato noodle soup; a standard dish that's hard to screw up. The beef brisket was passable, but the broth had a lot of oil when I pick it up with my spoon (but at least it had some resemblance of tomato). Worst of all, the noodles were terrible; they were clumped together and broke apart way too easily.

The iced lemon tea was even more of a disgrace, as there was simply no sugar in the drink. Overall I was very disappointed in my meal.

Needless to say I most likely will not come back."}
{"text":"Don't bother if you're vegetarian. 

Since every item on the menu has meat, I waved a waitress over and asked if she could do the curry dish with tofu and vegetables instead. She scrunched up her face with a look of, \"Why would you want that?!\" Thankfully, she wave the manager over, who quickly agreed that it wouldn't be a problem. 

The curry dish they brought out was pretty tasty, with pieces of potato - perfect and not overcooked - and a few slivers of okra. I also got a generous plate of rice. The curry had a nice, strong flavour without being overpowering. I nearly finished it but stopped when I got to the bottom, only to uncover slivers of beef. 

Well, I guess I don't have to come back, unless I start eating meat again. Overall, still a great deal. My mom got a bowl of pho and our two meals combined came out to $13.50 after tax."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant is located inside the Woodside Square. The decor is a bit old and could use an update. My wife and in-laws each had a bowl of noodles and I had the beef pineapple fried rice. The portions are big and I had some leftover rice to bring home. Service was good but it was sometimes hard to get the waitress' attention since they were busy."}
{"text":"Gross, gross, gross.

I came here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and I was only able to find the restaurant now. 

Coming into an empty restaurant at 6PM should've been a warning sign but since we've tried every pho restaurant in Scarbs, this would've been our last chance at finding something decent.

There were at least 10 fruit flies buzzing around our table and overheard another customer complained when she walked in 15 minutes later. 
I understand that some produce attracts more insect activity than others but it is nooooot okay when the insects completes in swimming lessons in my pho soup.

My pho was pretty good in terms of taste and portions of meat in comparison to noodles.  But my bowl just felt so dirty and the flies made 10000000x more paranoid. 
My boyfriend ordered the wonton noodles and he literally didn't want to touch anything ): He said the wontons were hard and tasted the stale while the egg noodles were overdone to the point of mush.

The management has to up their hygiene of the store asap."}
{"text":"Pho Xe Lua is tucked inside Woodside Mall, in the heart of Scarborough. My wife and our two kids have been attending this restaurant for at least 3-4 years every Sunday afternoon.
I'll spare you the literary pretensions.  The food is delivered fast and hot.  It tastes delicious.  The clientele is mostly Vietnamese (i.e. When the Vietnamese are eating at the Vietnamese place...that is a good sign).  The staff are efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Well, I liked the meat and noodles. Quality meat and quality noodles. Strangely, the broth tasted... Watered down. The rice dishes (we ordered 4) were better than the soups. They also have nice combos if you go with more than one person.

I didn't like their customer service, but you don't really eat pho for the customer service. Like, I mean the waitress made it seem we were bugging her when we asked for extra bowls and a serving spoon. She also didn't speak much English, and kind of judged our orders, which was weird and not appreciated.

Decor is meh and it's not the cleanest looking place, which obviously influences the experience of eating."}
{"text":"This Xe Lua is located inside Woodside Square and is one of the better Xe Lua I have been to.

Great location if you are doing something in the mall as I can go to the Library, Shop at LCBO and Shoppers and even pick up some grocery without even moving my car!

People working here are super friendly. My Special Pho Medium ($6) is reasonably priced and the soup based is nice and well flavoured! Extra point for fresh rice noodle!

The combination meal for 2 for $17 is definitely the best deal as it even comes with appetizer and free drinks!"}
