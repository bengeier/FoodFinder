{"text":"Pros: Rolls, live music
Not so con: Frango no Churrasco
Cons: Bacalhau, parking lot, waitress service, no free Wi-Fi

Is it a good restaurant for kids? Yes
Is it good choice for big groups? Yes
Is the parking lot enough to accommodate the customers? No

On Thursday around 7:00pm, me and my wife went to the restaurant to have our dinner and we faced the first negative point, the parking lot. The parking lot was not enough to accommodate all the people to the restaurant because it is shared with other stores around. So, it was not hard, but it was easy to notice there was not enough space for everyone. At least, we did not need to wait so much time to sit.

The table was clean, but there was an old newspaper below my table and I noticed that the floor was not totally clean. On a first moment, I thought that the waitress service was nice, but after we placed the order, we got forgotten. My soda glass was empty for a long time and the waitress never comes back asking if I wanted more. But the rolls were delicious, unfortunately, what I cannot say about the Frango no Churrasco and the Bacalhau that me and my wife asked.

Overall, it was frustrating for asking the two items that were house specialties and eat a food with poor quality. The Bacalhau was under seasoned and burned plus the potatoes were blend too. My Frango no Churrasco, the chicken was almost very good, the rice and potatoes were almost cold. It seems that the food was released for a time and they forgot there. But the worst for me was having a bad Bacalhau on a Portuguese restaurant. It is a very bad sign. I don't plan to come back again to it and if you are looking for a Portuguese restaurant, I recommend looking for other. There are a plenty around the Greater Toronto Area."}
{"text":"Good food, big servings, we really enjoyed our meals and the portion size. 
Improved service, 
Kate served four of us
She is pleasant, quick and proactive
Just a pleasure even at the busiest of time. Much appreciated. 
Thanks for making our Saturday night."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever experienced by our group of five. Very rude waitresses  
Embarrassment to our guests from out of country.
Best to drive to Mississauga location for both food and service. 
Going to a nearby bakery for coffee and dessert since they clearly didn't care to provide any service."}
{"text":"First time sitting inside which was quite loud, you're much better off sitting in their gorgeous patio. It's like being in someone's beautiful backyard for a bbq with way better food than your friends could ever cook.

We always get the same thing at Bairrada - start with the flaming sausage and some shrimps in that amazing garlic butter sauce. You're missing out if you don't sop up the garlic butter and some of those chorizo juices with the bread. 

Main course is always a big garden salad (so simple yet so perfect, onion cucumber peppers iceberg and tomato in a house vinegarette) and the BBQ chicken with rice and potatoes. What on earth do they do to those potatoes to make them so delicious. They're perfectly cooked and that oil on them is delicious. Chicken is always nicely prepared with crispy skin and juicy meat. 

To top everything off, and I mean I put it on everything, their peri peri sauce is not too spicy but certainly not mild. It's what sets them apart for sure.

Summer is coming, next time I'll be outside!"}
{"text":"Bad food and service. Toronto has many places to pick from.... avoid this one..
We ordered fish and it was so bad!!!!  The taste was off.. When we mentioned this to the waitress, she said  \"the owner doesn't know how to buy good fish\"  SERIOUS?
Cheap quality and a money grab for customer.. read the reviews and you will see that this place is not for people that care for good food and customer service.

Servers run around rushing through the customers waiting for a table and have no customer service."}
{"text":"Well where do we start. I'm sitting in this restaurant which is average at best in appearance; but I'm happy to be out with my family on a beautiful night. I must agree with a similar review that states that if it wasn't for the wonderful service I would give this place a \"0\" . We ordered the T-bone stake which was pretty tough served with average fry's and terrible rice, also ordered fish fillet which was ok and the bad bad bad and I'll say it again bad Grilled Bacalhau; it smelled like rotten fish which I refused to eat and sent back. People this is a Portuguese restaurant and it means you are not permitted to screw up this dish,period!!!!!!!!!  The server was very professional, offered something different and refused to charge for the awful dish. I was grateful for his gesture and tipped him accordingly. I do not recommend this place, it is clear that the back of the house has very little respect for food."}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I have been at Bairrada Churrasquiera Grill in Mississsauga and what a change. There was 9 of us this past Saturday and we were celebrating two family birthdays. We choose this place for convenience of meeting as we all lived in different areas.

The waiter was very friendly and aimed to please. We ordered several fried calamari plates which were very good - perfectly cooked. Someone ordered the cheese and olive plate and passed it around - it was good too - you can't go wrong with something not cooked as long as it is fresh. The menu used to have small and large portions and I would always go for the smaller one which was more than enough if not too much food for me. I would frequently have the steak with an egg on top which came with the round fries and tons of broccoli. There are now only large portions and the steak with an egg came with rice and french fries (the frozen variety - not hand cut). Two starches with no veggies! The steak was massive and the price was double of what I used to pay for the smaller portion. Needless to say, I could not finish it - not even half! The steak was a little overcooked and that was the consensus around the table for those who ordered steak. If you want medium, you might want to ask for medium rare. My step son ordered pulled pork which came cold with no sauce - not what he was expecting and he didn't like it but didn't want to complain and send it back. Another change was the bread - they used to have the best Portuguese bread but now it's a doughy white bread. A few people ordered the chicken which was just ok....not as good as other places. My daughter ordered a strawberry daiquiri and it was overly sweet.

They did bring us two birthday deserts with candles for the birthday boy and girl. AND the waiter sang a bit.

We have been frequenting the Barraida Churrasqueira on College Street in Toronto and I believe the chicken is better there.

{"text":"É uma casa portuguesa, com certeza!
É, com certeza, uma casa portuguesa!

Famous lyrics from a famous fado, sung by the incomparable Amalia Rodrigues. The song is a tribute to Portuguese tradition, something I look for in a Portuguese eatery. At first sight, I'm almost convinced I'll be reliving my childhood filled with delicious flavors from the homeland. Sadly, Bairrada left me wanting more.
The whole family is here and it's really nice out back on the patio. It's spacious, simple, and reminds me of being a kid again, mostly because my nieces and nephews love the waterfall feature and the ability to run freely. The crowd is eclectic and that makes sense since Bairrada is no frills and no attitude.

You can't go wrong with a refreshing bottle of vinho verde, and there's a pretty good selection here. The food on the other hand, makes me sad. I'm not sad because it's bad, the portions are huge and relatively tasty. I'm sad because the food lacks passion. I have fond memories of my mother and her amazing Portuguese shrimp, simmered in a reduction of beer and lemon, and loaded with flavor. Bairrada's shrimp is boring and far too loaded with beer, giving it an acrid and slightly bitter taste on the palette. My Grouper is MIA and while everyone else is enjoying their main course, I'm flagging down our server to find out what happened to my meal. \"Oh, I'm sorry! It's coming, give me two minutes.\" Twenty minutes later, and my grouper arrives; obviously they missed my order. Meh. It's all a very bland affair.

They don't take debit here and I'm directed to the ATM machine at the front door. It doesn't work and the waitress doesn't seem to care and redirects me to the sleazy bar across the street. There's nothing more that I love than leaving the party waiting while I figure out how to pay for dinner. Bairrada: please invest in a portable debit machine. You seem to be doing well, and if you raise the bar on your food, you'll do better and the additional revenue will cover the cost of your merchant fees.
My advice to you from a Portuguese born and raised guy: this is not the place to go to if you're looking for polished Portuguese food. I've had much better at a local churrasqueira buffet."}
{"text":"A couple of workmates and I went here for lunch recently as it was recommended by one of them. 

We started by sharing the Queijo Fresco (cheese app) and the Courico a Bombeiro (flaming Portuguese sausages soaked in \"moonshine\"). The cheese dish was quite good and the flaming sausages were terrific.

We all ordered fish mains, I am all about the Sardines in Portuguese restaurants, and the others ordered the Cod and the Sea Bass. While we didn't share, the Sardines were fantastic and the others quite liked their choices as well.

The St Clair location, just west of the Stockyards, is 1 of 4 locally and it is definitely a place that I will return to with the family."}
{"text":"I came to this place with my family on a whim for dinner after a calm day at high park.

I SHOULD HAVE WENT HOME INSTEAD!

The place was PACKED and also THE LONGEST LINE UP for a restaurant I've been in so far.
But then again, you could be optimistic and get over that there's a long line up and enjoy the food, right?..... AS IF!
I waited almost 30 minutes JUST FOR A TABLE!
WHAT THE HELL! And also the line up only goes up to a certain point because it may block the serving window for the waiters, which is understandable.
But again, WHAT THE HELL!?!
The waiter was quite rude in telling us to move, his words were \"STOP BLOCKING THE WINDOW! WE NEED TO GET THE FOOD OUT, YOU DON'T MOVE WE CAN'T SERVE FOOD!, GEEZ PEOPLE\", and I say to you good sir reading this review, I JUST GOT THERE AND MIND YOU THERE WAS ABOUT 7-10 PLATES OF UNSERVED FOOD IN THE WINDOW!, SO, SO FAR YOUR SO CALLED WAITERS ARE SERVING NOTHING THEREFORE I'M NOT BLOCKING ANYTHING SINCE YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB!, I did move but, have some decency good sir, I'm hungry and you're being paid do your job and not leave all the food in the window.
After that fiasco, about a good 30 minutes I FINALLY got table! Then I WAITED 10 MINUTES TO GET SOMEONE TO TAKE MY ORDER! again... WHAT THE HELL!?!, not even 3 minutes into waiting for food, the waiter comes back and tells me, \"Sorry we don't have your drink currently available\", I didn't mind considering how packed the place was so I ordered a soda instead.... after I got a soda, THE EXACT SAME DRINK THEY SAID THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE WAS SOME HOW MAGICALLY REPLENISHED AND GIVEN TO ANOTHER COSTUMER!, SERIOUSLY!?!, I WAITED FOR MY FOOD FOR 2 WHOLE HOURS AND NOTHING SHOWED UP, I asked for a bread basket at about the 1 hour 30 minute mark because I WAS FLIPPING HUNGRY, and the waitress once again said, \"We don't have this, some tables have this, some don't\"
So Miss waitress, you're telling me, that a restaurant that is ment to serve whatever the costumer orders doesn't have ANYTHING THAT I ORDER! And mind you fellow reader, the place is now a fair bit empty as no one was getting served.
BUT STLL, LESS PEOPLE, LESS ORDERS, LESS FOOD = HIGH PROBABILITY OF YOU GETTING FOOD, and the food I wanted, WAS A FLIPPING APPETIZER, HOW DO YOU NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOOD FOR AN APPETIZER!?!? Gordon Ramsay is swearing and looking down on you in shame, this restaurant would be on Kitchen Nightmares! (By the way, my appetizers was just fried calamari, JUST FRIED CALAMARI!) at this point I lost it, as I am typing right now, it is 9:46pm....... I CAME HERE AT 7:03pm!, I always time my experience so I give you dear reader, a better review.

In short, the waiters are rude and don't do their job, food is left on the window, cold, LONG WAIT TIMES FOR LINE UPS, and that wait time is on infinity for even being served an appetizer or whatever else, there is not enough food for every table therefore no equity in service, No food, did I mention that? A restaurant with no food?, also... NO FLIPPING NAPKINS ON ANY TABLES, RESTAURANTS WITH NO NAPKINS? My WHAT THE HELL, has been upgraded to WHAT THE FUCK!?!

Dear Reader, never come to this place, I could've gone home at the 1h 30min mark and eaten some good old microwave pizza instead of consuming the oxygen around me."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine introduced me to Bairrada quite few years ago and became a fan instantly. I had driven past it for years and never even thought to drop in. I am glad I did. They have excellent food, decent portions for great prices. My girlfriend and I eat here on a monthly basis. She loves the barbecue chicken, I love the house steak and we both love the Sangria ! 
      The only minor drawbacks that I see are the tables being extremely close together the desserts in the plastic cups, but the food makes up for  them by far. 
      I have tried many dishes off the menu and have never been let down. They also serve most of their dishes with the most amazing chilli sauce that I would buy by the gallon if I could.
      The service at times can be a little slow but that is only because they get really busy sometimes. With that being said we have always had extremely friendly and gracious service. 
      If you are in the mood for great barbecue chicken drive past the Swiss Chalet and all the other chain restaurant and give Bairrada a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Staff were great, very responsive even with a ton of people in attendance. The food was great, and the dessert was excellent! 

I recommend making a reservation, and love their patio seating."}
{"text":"Best Patio in Toronto! The food is cheap and cheerful.
Enjoy a beautiful summer night at this joint with good friends. That's good living!!"}
{"text":"I went for a work function. We had quite a large group. It was pretty busy throughout the restaurant, but food/drink service was prompt. The salmon was delicious. This place has a really great patio."}
{"text":"Bairrada's a bustling, popular spot for Portuguese, and for good reason. While they're best known for their BBQ chicken and multiple cod recipes, Bairrada has a rotating menu of weekly specials, so there's different stuff every day. I just tried the stewed goat with potatoes and rice, and it was delicious (though not the best choice if you're looking for a light meal).

This location is spun off from the first Bairrada on College (there's also another, bigger location in Mississauga). There's a dining room, as well as a separate take-out entrance off on the side which connects to the kitchen. While you're waiting for your order, you can watch them scramble about and lug huge pots of rice."}
{"text":"Back when I first started going to Bairrada, the 1/2 chicken dinner with potatoes &amp; rice cost a whopping $7.00.  The price has slowly increased and is now $10.00.  Still a really good deal considering the quality of the food and the fact that one order feeds 2 people with average appetites and you still have leftovers!

The patio in the summer is a well kept secret (well, not anymore now that I outed it on Yelp :)).  Its a hidden oasis with a lovely Japanese garden to look at while you enjoy your lovely meal.  

The house salad leaves much to be desired - it often comes drenched in oil.  One dish I also like to order is the grilled sardines.  Squeeze a little lemon &amp; serve w/ rice.  YUM.  

Whatever you do, don't forget to ask for some piri-piri sauce.  Its excellent poured all over your food.  I like to smear it on my bread instead of butter.

Plan ahead - there are often lineups out the door.  But in case you're a poor planner, not to worry - they have take out!"}
{"text":"Went to this place - Portuguese restaurant with a group of best friends on last Saturday. We ordered some of their popular dishes: 1. Portuguese BBQ Chicken (Frango no Churrasco) - one of the most traditional and popular dishes in Portuguese cuisine. This dish is quite healthy and utilizes the natural and zesty flavor of lemon along with a spicy Portuguese paprika kick to make an unbelievably flavorful and hearty dish 2. Flaming sausage, certainly mouth watering delicious dish 3. Roasted Pork 4. Grilled Sardines 5. Red Sangria... All of the food came out so delicious and served on the table with good service. We all enjoyed the dinner in the restaurant throughout the night. Will definitely come back again..."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Bairrada churrasqueira grill I have an unbelievable meal and an overall great night out. Their outdoor patio is wonderful for partying and chilling with friends, in the fall they've got huge conical flames that warm patrons. It's got a busy vibe on Saturday nights and at times service can be a bit hit and miss, but food ALWAYS delivers. The cooks work their asses off and they create wonderful smoky flavors with the grill and the chickens spit roast on their rotisserie. Some of my favs are the bacalau, T-bone steak w/ soft egg on top (runny egg rules the world), their über-spicy portuguese hot sauce complimentary to each table, the in-house baked portuguese cornbread (a little molasses note but soo yumm with a bit of butter), quails grilled with red wine and garlic are smoky delightful morsels of excellence!! Also must try their suckling pig on the spit (done OUTSIDE during the summer!! Yeebwoyy!!) and \"drunken\" chorizo which they flambée à la table, soo elegant and my guy friends always scarf it (plus the dish they serve it in is soo cute, a little pink ceramic piglet). Eat here next! Also you must try their portuguese beer *SUPERBOCK* with your meal, it takes things to new heights... Love this place. College St gem for realsies. Enjoy it eh!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My Portuguese friend brought me to this place twice already. 

I love their patio, it's rated as one of the best patios in Toronto (College location one) and I can see why. It's really nice out there, the setting, the decor and the atmosphere. 

They have a big variety of dishes on the menu, from chicken to steaks to seafood. Their food is pretty authentic. I had the prime rib steak for $16 -  GREAT pricing. Comes with fries and rice. Very filling. They also make great pina coladas. 

I recommend going there early or have a reservation because the place gets really packed every day. 

Overall, a great place to go. Pretty authentic Portuguese place with great food and great price."}
{"text":"Great patio and delightful wait staff but it's the food here is hit and miss and overall has been in decline for several years. I keep going back at far less frequent intervals for sentimental reasons but the food disappoints more frequently than not. I'm guessing the founder has stepped away from the business. Regretful"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap and hearty meal Bairrada is the place to go.
The atmosphere isn't overly classy but the staff are friendy and it's a great place to grab some grub (can be a bit greasy/oily at times) and catch a soccer game.
They do have a nice backyard patio -- picnic tables and all, -- but great for groups with kids.
I especially love the sangria and the garlic-beer shrimps. Yumyum! There's also a very tasty seafood platter that I've shared with a few friends.
Bairrada is also great for picking up a roasted chicken and some of those little round potatoes."}
{"text":"Best BBQ chicken in Toronto, love the hot sauce.
Wicked Patio, call ahead for seating."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. But the best part is the obscene portions they give you, which is why I give it 5 stars. The amount of food for the very affordable price is great value."}
{"text":"I recently went back on a beautiful summer evening and had the usual delicious Bairrada Portuguese BBQ. 

Going back reminded me that this place probably has the nicest patio in the city and even on a Monday night it was packed. Go and check it out before its too cold and you have to wait another 6 months. 

It's cheap too."}
{"text":"This review is about a bad and traumatic catering experience, made worse by the catering manager Carlos.
The details of the experience are further below. 

The Summary: 
- The food arrived an hour and 15 mins late after some guests had left. 
- It was an 80th birthday party and there were lots of hungry seniors. 
- The ordered food was not delivered, and what was sent was cold. 
- The phone calls trying to find Carlos and the food were not answered and finally needed to be dealt with by a law student who knew the legalities of a business' accountability.

The details:
About 3 weeks before the event date at the request of the birthday girl who was familiar with Bairrada's food, I went to the restaurant and inquired about their catering options. I met with a lovely girl who showed me the menu, the catering platter sizes, and told me the costs. I made a list of what I wanted and based on her knowledge she advised me of the quantities I should be ordering for the size of my party. 
For desserts she showed me all their options from the fridge showcase and suggested the Natas do ceu which they do very well, so I bought one to take home for the birthday girl to try.
I left my contact information with her, took the catering menu with me and left.

A few days later Carlos called to talk and finalize the order. He suggested a few changes like getting the potatoes alone, not the ones with the carrots; and getting 2 trays of the bacalao if we weren't going to be serving people, in case some people take a lot of it. I agreed to those suggestions. 
He described and emphasized they do a fantastic \"Portuguese Grilled Vegetables\" which I agreed to. 
He suggested Caramel custard for dessert. This I said was a definite no as many people don't like the texture and strong egg taste. I insisted on the Natas do ceu that I had picked up at the restaurant.

He at no point suggested I meet with him to finalize the menu.

Leading up to the event, further calls with him were weird. He would leave me messages in Portuguese, and sometimes I felt like the conversation was happening for the first time. He'd go through the list and it sounded like he was writing it down as we spoke. It was a week before the event and I started to think I should be looking for someone else. But being able to find a caterer for 70 people and getting the food to the birthday girl to try and approve was not going to be possible, so I stayed with Bairrada. Big mistake!!

The day of the event, the food was to arrive at 1:30pm. Guests were there around 1pm and we had light snacks as we didn't want them filled up, and wanted them to enjoy a good meal! (or so we thought!)

At 1:40 I called the only number I had, which was of the restaurant, to inquire about the status of the delivery. The person who answered the phone had no idea where the delivery was. He said he'd call me back. He did about 10 mins later and said it was on it's way. I asked if I could contact the delivery people myself so I would know where they were and have an idea of when to expect them. He would not give me the number to contact them. This went on until 2:45pm when the delivery finally arrived. 
Myself and 5 guests rushed to the delivery van and carried the boxes out ourselves into the venue. There was one slow driver sent with the 10 boxes some of which had dripped sauce into the van that was then on our very good clothing.
As we started opening the boxes I noticed that some of the food was wrong.
It also wasn't hot. I had ordered chafing dishes, but at that point there wasn't time to set them up and start heating the food.

The food was set up and served as it was delivered. (Almost embarrassing)

The driver then produced a bill. I refused payment due to it being extremely late and some of it being wrong. 
Carlos was then on the phone again demanding the full amount be sent back with the driver, without acknowledging the wrong food and the delay. 

He insisted the (still) frozen California mix was the Portuguese Grilled Vegetables and the repeatedly rejected Caramel custard was what I ordered. 

He was willing to take the cost of the unused chafing dishes off the bill and with that thought he was doing me a huge favour. 

Eventually I asked one of the guests who is a law student to deal with him and set him straight. We took 15% off the bill ourselves and I said I would follow that up with him after the event.

At the end of the night, I received an unapologetic, rude, accusatory message from Carlos telling me to never contact him again. That message has been safely saved and filed. 

Lessons learned: 
- Use a reputable caterer for a catered event. Don't use a restaurant with no experience and an incompetent catering \"manager\"
- Have them give you samples of the food you are ordering and take pictures of all the food you order
- Don't ever deal with Bairrada Churrasqueira Grill as long as you live!"}
{"text":"We got take out from this place...

The chicken was dry and gross. We were given a tray covered in tin foil containing our chicken, rather than proper take out containers - nearly spilling it all in our car though it really wouldn't have been any loss..

Ordered a side containing clams - and were given one clam.

This place sucks.

Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Save your money and try one of the other million chicken restaurants around the city."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, friendly efficient staff. No criticism here. The portions are huge, the prices are good, and the patio is a great place to enjoy a meal and a drink.
Would recommend, we'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to go for a cheap & cheerful meal.  In my opinion, not only do they have the tastiest, crispiest, and juiciest chicken but they have the best puri-puri sauce to go with it.  For around $10 a person, you can feast on their large chicken dinner which comes with rice and roasted Parisian potatoes (those adorable round ones).  As an option, I sometimes swap out the rice for veggies or for more potatoes.  Bairrada also has one of THE BEST patios in all of Toronto.  

TIP: They're closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Best place for steak with an affordable price. You won't find a better deal in Mississauga.  However, the service leaves a lot to desire.  We were the only ones who were waiting to be seated and there were empty tables.  4 waiters walked by us like we were transparent.  After 10 minutes we were finally seated and after we ordered the food, it took a long time for the food to come.  The waiter was nice enough to give us extra bread, but they messed up one of our orders.  When we asked for the bill we have to wait for 5 minutes, then when I wanted the card machine we have to wait for another 5 minutes.  I would give them 5 stars if they can improve their process."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at this restaurant, my wife had the chicken and  I had the T-bone steak.  Both dishes were so delicious, the provided basket of bread had lots of variety and plentiful.   We would definitely come back to this place next time we are in Mississauga."}
{"text":"They appeared to have forgotten our orders- the meals arrived well over an hour later and while the patio was busy, other tables who had arrived after ours were served earlier. The bread was stale. When we asked for fresher bread, another basket, equally stale, appeared. I ordered the breaded sole- it seemed as if the fish had previously drowned- extremely soggy, tasteless, overcooked and swimming within the batter. The garden salad we ordered came even later and when it arrived after further prodding, had no dressing we could discern.  One of our group ordered a quarter chicken, which she said was dry and even though she claimed she was starving, left most of her meal, including the rice and potatoes. No-one was impressed by their choices. The patio itself was full of families, noisy but nice, and on a positive note, the sangria was good and the waiter was friendly, though overwhelmed perhaps by the tables he had to deal with."}
{"text":"Drinking and eating with a couple of friend on the patio in the summer on a Saturday evening is definitely something to look forward to after a long week of hard work. I love it here. The food is cheap and everything taste great and the waiters are hot and friendly, what more can you ask for?

The service can be a bit slow, so make sure to bring friends and eat a lot their bread with the special home made hot sauce."}
{"text":"Cheap, huge portions, good food, really busy service can be a bit slow."}
{"text":"We had some business in the area, and I had always wondered about this chicken place, so we got takeout for 7 people and shared it for lunch at work.  

*Chicken-I wanted to love it-I liked it.  Found it a bit dry, especially the white meat.
*Potatoes-the little round ones-love.  Creamy, savory, big winner.
*Rice-it's rice.
*Veggie-it's broccoli.

The piri piri sauce is uber-greasy.  Mildish flavour.  

Overall, the team loved it!  They thoroughly enjoyed the foot, and the best thing is there's plenty of leftovers for the next day.     

Looked like a fun family restaurant, not very fancy, there were picnic benches outside which should lead to a nice outdoor supper come warmer months.  

Now, I want to go back and try some of their seafood specialties like clams, shrimps and fish.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"On Wednesday nights, Bairrada offers a \"pig roast\" which works like a magnet on fans of old-fashioned, simple, rustic approach to meat.  If that's what attracts you to the restaurant, you need to know the following:  There is indeed a large pig roasted on an outdoor spit, which sits to the side of the restaurant's beautiful garden patio.  But the pig is not on the menu and you cannot order it as a course.  The restaurant offers complimentary small portions of the pig to all guests as an appetizer.  It is delicious, but if roasted pork is what you came here for, you won't be satisfied.  There's suckling pig on the menu, but as our very helpful waitress explained, the restaurant gets one piglet each day and sells out of it at lunchtime.  

The restaurant offers a selection of meat and seafood, including the iconic Portuguese bacalao (grilled salt cod), grilled sardines, and meats of all kinds.  The cuisine is not fancy, but portions are generous, flavours robust and prices not extravagant.  Creme caramel and passion pudding were both wonderful desserts.

What stood out for me was without doubt, the restaurant's wine list.  It isn't long, but I saw more  than a dozen Portuguese wines I've never heard of (unavailable at LCBO, I suspect), all priced very reasonably.  $35 got us a bottle of truly delicious, meaty, robust red from Alentejo.  So skip the mediocre sangria and choose a bottle of wine instead, or ask your server for a recommendation.  You won't regret.

Portuguese food wouldn't be my first choice when going to a restaurant, and my visit to Bairrada hasn't changed that.  However, I am already looking forward to going back there, if only to sit with friends at those long harvest tables on possibly the best patio in Toronto, snacking on wonderful soft fresh cheese, roasted red peppers and perfectly grilled calamari, and drinking my way through the restaurant's wine list."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. You cannot get better atmosphere in the summer. 

We revisited, with a couple, an old friend from high school and a sibling. There was no need to worry about the time that would be had by all. 

We were warmly welcomed by our server (he recognized us via our reservations) and were instantly treated like family. Before the food even arrived we were making friends with the Portuguese family beside us. 

Friday evening the patio was PACKED but they had added a couple more tables and some lovely plant-life. 

Group of six, we ordered a full chicken with potatoes (and piri piri), the seafood platter ($65) which on the menu, says it feeds 2. It is enormous. We also ordered (long weekend: wanted to party) FOUR pitchers of beer and TWO pitchers of sangria over the course of the evening. . Extra potatoes, the free bread.

In the end, we were all basically hammered, completely well fed, loving our life, with a phone number for a free stay in Portugal any time we like (not kidding) and covered in Piri Piri sauce. Two and a half hours of catching up on the patio set us back $200 or $40 each once tax and tip was considered.

Completely my go-to when I want to have a great evening in a warm atmosphere with friends, this last visit just elevated to five stars. Love it."}
{"text":"The back patio is nice. Food was heavy on the potatoes and rice portions...but the cod fish and chicken were good. Probably wont return here except for a beer in their beautiful back patio (:"}
{"text":"Huge patio, definately a nice outdoor place for the summer. Even features a garden. Indoors the interior is blah. 

Very popular place, went here during a weekday for dinner and there was still a wait time. 

Flaming sausage in a clay pig pot seems to be a specialty of theirs. Saw lots of people order this. 

We had ordered the BBQ chicken, rice, potatoes and a veal sandwich. Good food and atmosphere. Chilean house wine was also surprisingly of excellent quality!  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Party size: 9
Price: $170 before tip
Order: mixed platter, flaming sausage; garden salad; BBQ chicken, chicken breast, house steak, quail, tiger shrimp, Spanish style clams, crab, sea bass

Having always passed by this place but never gone in, I decided to give this place a try with my family.  We went in on a Saturday and the place was packed with locals.  On our way in we spotted their special for the day - whole suckling pig.  It was a shame we did not try it.

Our favourites: The seafood (tiger shrimp, clams, crab) were delicious, especially the sauce for the Spanish style clams.
 
Our lease favourite: The chicken breast was very dry - would definitely not order that again.  I thought the BBQ chicken was just okay - have had better from the shops on Oakwood.

Conclusion: Giving this place a 3 because we found the food was too salty and chicken too dry. However, overall the service was great and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming. I would come back for the seafood and to try their different specials."}
{"text":"What a horrible place , I've been here before a few years ago and the food was ok at best, now it was horrible my wife order the grouper and was almost raw, she had to send it back for extra time on the grill, I had the halibut and it was so so, my sister in law had the cod and was tasteless and served with chips that tasted burned, all in all we'll never be back here ever again"}
{"text":"This is a communal review from 5 people:

Our waiter took 10 minutes to ask us what we would like to drink. When we were ready to order, we had to wait another 10 minutes before we could get his attention. The waiter didn't know which menu items the restaurant was out of. He came more than 15 minutes after we placed our order to let us know that they were out of one of the things we ordered. It took 40 minutes for us to get our food and some of our dishes were cold. On the positive side of things, at least the portions were large and the overall price was great. While waiting for our meals, we also had the most unfortunate circumstance of finding a disgusting piece of brown \"turd\" on the table. This begs to question if the tables were even cleaned properly prior to us being seated. We were appalled when we weren't invited to the \"ruffian\" poker game that took place in the basement of the vicinity. One can make the assumption that \"waiting\" is the theme of the restaurant; we sure experienced an abundance of it! Our waiter didn't even have the decency to ask us once how our meals were. He also disappeared for what seemed like an eternity as we were waiting to get receive our bills.. Ugh. (He was probably stuck playing a round of poker downstairs.) In addition to this abhorrent experience, we also received a lecture at the end of the meal for asking \"too late\" for our bills to be split. Perfect end to a \"perfect\" night. Royal Flush."}
{"text":"Service was terribly slow even though the place was not busy.
I received cold chicken...I ws so hungry I ate it.
Never going again, don't know how this place stays open.
Avoid."}
{"text":"The sometimes good, sometimes not so good chicken was in fact, very good last night. Patio is open for the summer and it's filling up. Skip the sangria though, it's $25 a pitcher. They should take down the TV in the back, it cheapens the experience."}
{"text":"Lol i feel so stupid. I ordered the pulled pork on a bun with fries because I expected juicy, flavourful pulled pork. I literally just got pork on a bun. No condiments, no seasoning or spices, not even onions for taste or literally anything else for that matter, just dry pork on a dry bun for $10. I put my French fries in the sandwich and some ketchup for taste with a pinch of salt. Maybe I ordered wrong. The flaming sausage was cool. I mean the presentation was nice but the sausage was really dry. My friends seemed to enjoy their meal. If I come again I'll stick to chicken."}
{"text":"Medium steak was a little too well done. Good portions though."}
{"text":"Best deal for your Money

Can't get enough of this place. Hearty portions, great taste, excellent service.  Very clean as well, Amazing bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Best meal for your money 
Huge portions well seasoned  meals great service, 
When  having a meal  here it's  a very relaxing no turnover start with a glass of wine and a appatizer, then your main course 
They are one of the best Portuguese chicken places in the GTA , But you must try the other dishes. 
From fish to steak.
The bar prices are also great .
This is a chain they have a few stories in Toronto and one in Mississauga, 
Best value for you money."}
{"text":"Generally I like this place.-I used to love it
Decent grub-great prices and if your lucky enough to grab a table on the patio then your chilling like a villain-grab a bottle of vinho verde and hope the food is good that day"}
{"text":"best meal in the city love the suckling pig"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday afternoon and it was really packed, had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. They pack the tables quite tight here, so be prepared to be elbow to elbow with the next. 

We started with the flaming sausages, which were quite tasty actually. Although flavorful, they were in fact just a little on the dry side, which is more noticeable as time passes so eat it quick. Good for 2 to share, $10. 

I had the roast chicken as per some other reviews here. It was tasty, with a nice BBQ flavor. Just a bit on the dry side. Complemented by some moist potatoes and delicious rice. With the sausage, it was very filling. $10. 

My dining partner had the brazilian steak, which was thin pieces of beef.  It also had a nice BBQ flavor but not much in the way of sauce. Still, if expecting grilled meat, this does the trick. 

All in all a tasty afternoon lunch, and for reasonable price. Would definitely come again, as you can't quite find these tastes elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you can catch the staff on a good day then this place has the potential to keep you coming back. The food is almost always great but there have been a few exceptions to this rule such as dry chicken as others have pointed out. 
Our first experience here was almost our last though. We sat down and ordered calamari as our app, and a chicken dinner for the main. About 10 minutes later, the waiter returned to inform us that they had turned off the grill and if we wanted the calamari, it would be roughly 30-45 minutes. OK, so no app. Then in one breath he was able to squeeze in that there was also no rice left, and walked away. 
Once our meals of end of the day leftovers arrived we were disappointed, obviously, as the chicken was pretty dry and the potatoes were hard. 
A friend of ours, who loves and swears by the place, convinced us to try it again and we had a completely different experience. The chicken was juicy, and the staff were less surly. 
Hit and miss.... Are you feeling lucky today?"}
{"text":"Came here by a recommendation from a friend, so my wife and I decided to try it out. Situated right beside Cookstown GO station in the same plaza as the LCBO can't miss it. Great cozy Portuguese place, also not going to break the bank here. They have a seperate area for just takeout like Swiss Chalet, keeps everyone from bottlenecking at the entrance. We started off with the soup of the day, followed by a cheese and olive dish served with hot chilli oil. I ordered their T-bone steak and it came on a bed of rice and fries, it was a huge portion for. My wife ordered the cod small portion which was in my opinion still pretty big, it also came on a bed of rice and potatoes. I also had 2 Heineken's with my meal, overall bill was approximately $64. I think this place is great for the price, I would take friends here for a nice casual meal anyday."}
{"text":"Honestly pretty terrible. I got the half chicken and potatoes rice takeout one evening, and the reheated chicken was unbelievably dry and hard. There might have been one bite of dark meat that resembled chicken. This is the freshest food they have at 7 pm??

The spicing wasn't that good, kind of flavourless. The small round potatoes can be fun to eat, these were bland and seemed to be long reheated. There was rice as well, some of it was hard as gravel.

Careless fast food shoveled at you for double fast food prices. What a disappointing shame, I really wanted to try good Portugese chicken in Toronto. The Piri Piri I had in Montreal was always fresh, succulent and bursting with flavours. (Ave. du Parc.) must be made to order I suppose, and following a great (not indifferent) spicing method."}
{"text":"I love their grilled chicken! It tastes so good and not so dry unlike the other Portuguese inspired grilled chicken. The piri piri sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"Much better than I was expecting  Reading these reviews after the fact was a bit confusing - methinks doth protest too much.

Although I had opportunities over the years to visit this place, I never did so until recently, when a board I work with went out to lunch. While I can see some of the problems people note in retrospect (namely, somewhat smaller portion sizes than other Portuguese restaurants), the quality was great and the service was prompt.

We all shared a platter of calamari, a couple platters of chicken and rice. Top that all off with custard tarts and Spanish coffee along with quick service, and you can see how I could be easily swayed by the place.

Definitely worth a visit, and one place I'll going back to soon."}
{"text":"This place is a feast! I came here with a group of fifteen for a friends birthday party. It's the kind of family friendly place where you will feel the urge to raise a toast and say salut sopranos style if you come with a big enough group like we did. 

The Portuguese BBQ chicken was succulent and the clams were very flavourful... don't waste the clam sauce, it is perfect for sopping up with the bread. The accompanying roasted baby potatoes are addictive and reminiscent of the food your grandmother would make. 

The patio is one of the best in the city; lively, green and laid back. I will be coming here again for another family feast : D !"}
{"text":"Great patio if you have the patience to wait.  I don't.  Food is ok, but so many better and similar Portuguese restaurants in the area.   They do have one of the best hot sauces for a Portuguese restaurant.  So yeah, good hot sauce.
Service is prompt but damn everyone in that place seems angry, chill out you are in the service industry.  Would go back if I really had too, so probably won't."}
{"text":"Nice patio to spend a night with friends.   That's where it all ends.  Food is mediocre and not much in terns of good drinks.  Would go back, not in an excited way but in a if you want I'll go kind of way.

This space could be stellar if they put more effort in food and drinks."}
{"text":"Bairrada Churrasqueira Grill is one of the few Portuguese restaurants in Toronto that actual Portuguese people go to for Portuguese food. There are absolutely no pretentious downtown hipster here to spoil an authentic food experience. Well, semi-authentic. An authentic experience would involve the very least a show of live animal slaughter. If you want the authentic experience, it would include your involvement and a change of clothes. But...I don't want to get off track..

The bowl of bread is complimentary. I'm not sure if this is normal practice because I don't look at the items on my receipt, I just look at the final price, and if I'm comfortable with the number that correlates with what's on the table, I'm satisfied and that's the end of that part of my life. The bread varies in three kinds, and it comes with more than enough (frozen) butter for anyone's enjoyment. 

Apparently, this restaurant is most popular for takeaways. They even have a window dedicated solely for customers ordering takeaways. Romeo, my best pork-chop friend told me that their kitchen is the cleanest kitchen in comparison to...other kitchens?
From the looks of it, I can't argue otherwise. Those brushed metal surfaces looks as if they were installed yesterday.

The fish is good, the pork is okay, the cheese platter with the chilli oil sauce is beautiful, and the steak just makes me happy to be alive. My only complaint is that the calamari is too soggy, otherwise, the food here is as hardy and wholesome and other civilized euphemisms as it gets. Pair it with a bottle of Super Bock and life is great. The food takes time to arrive, because cooking takes time. I don't understand why Portuguese restaurants serve some foods on metallic platters, which I have yet to learn the reason to. I have yet to experience the entire menu, but the steak & eggs is quickly becoming my usual when coming here. 

If you were wondering 'Bairrada' meant, just check piece of paper used to coaster your plates."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, chicken. This place should get a higher grade but it's only the service that prevents it from being a 4 star joint. One kid usually mans the counter while the customers line up. The result is that you have someone who is taking orders, trying to prepare meals and generally keep the place running all at once. Needless to say, the result is a 10-15 minute wait for food that should take 60 seconds to get out.

But what food! Not as good as the portuguese places in Montreal (particularly the one on Rachel) but still delicious and enormous servings. We got a whole chicken and a half and an enormous bag of fries for three people and feasted like kings. Skip the round potatoes which are swimming in fat and grab cole slaw instead for a perfect takeaway meal."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last two years, and the fact I'm reviewing this place on Yelp is a tragedy in itself.  

Churrasqueira Grill has been a secret spot for many of my Portuguese friends, we get together and enjoy foreign beer and semi-exotic cuisine, this restaurant was once adverse to the local youths and pretentious vintage bicycle whores.  Unfortunately this is no longer so, as this place has been quote-on-quote discovered.  

It used to be that after a day of my friends' children football (soccer) practice, or just a day of enjoying the town we would come here for wholesome quality food in a relaxed environment, and occasionally join in on the celebrations happening at the impressive backyard patio.  These days are all but gone, and now the tables here are infested with plastic shades and second-hand clothing.  A hipster infestation!
Due to the overwhelming traffic of these social parasites, the kitchen is under tremendous pressure to turnout dishes every minutes, significantly reducing the quality of the food and service.  I don't want to share my dining experience with these people!  They are an eyesore! EYESORE! 

Before, the chicken is tender, the sausages were juicy, the veal was well prepared and the waitress competent.  Now...the chicken taste as if they were raised in the sahara desert, sausages are as dull as the piglet dish it's served on, veal seems to be slaughtered in their teenage years, and the waitress runs with her head cut off half of the time.  Anytime hipsters move into an neighbourhood the quality of everything plunges, and sadly Bairriada Churrasqueira has been one of its gravest victim.  So now me and my chest hair mates must find elsewhere to unwind, ARGH!
It'll be difficult to find somewhere that serves the fresh cheese with that chilli sauce so authentically, this quiet area is officially tarnished by these wretched trendies. 

Local gems only sparkle while they remain hidden..this place has tragically lost its lustre."}
{"text":"Went to take out window so can't comment  on dine in. Needed to feed a hungry crowd of teenagers. Ordered 2 and a half whole chickens, a large order of Parisienne potatoes and a large rice. Total was $39.00!!  Way cheaper than ordering pizza or Swiss chalet for this crowd. Comfortably fed 6 kids and 2 adults and we didn't finish it all. Yay! Leftovers!  Chicken was delicious. Moist and flavorful. The piri piri sauce is very good but oily (which is normal I think). Teens really liked the food, great crowd pleaser for a Friday night when you don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"I've searching for a good portuguese place since I moved back from Montreal. This place meets the criteria: tons of bbq options, lots of fresh grilled fish and seafood options, big (and i mean really big) outdoor patio, pitchers of sangria for cheap...

I like the casual, family-owned vibe. The inexpensive prices are a plus too.
My only gripe? The piri piri is OK - it's not bad, but it's not great... perhaps a touch salty and not nearly spicy enough for my palate... alas the search continues..."}
{"text":"Great food and service with an incredibly big patio! Their patio is just the place to chill out on a Sunday evening with family and friends. Lots of sunny and shaded space! I had the fish dish and it was amazing. Shared a pitcher of sangria and thoroughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Portuguese BBQ meats and assortment of fish and seafood dishes. 

Ambiance is laid back and awesome in the summer. Beautiful patio and they show major sporting events there too.  

Servers and patron are very friendly as this joint seems very familiar with the regulars.

Piri piri sauce is hot and yummy.  Pork and bean stew was hearty and filling.  The BBQ was succulent and the Bitock (Steak with an Egg on top) was juicy and delicious."}
{"text":"I am half Portuguese and hadn't had food that I didn't have to make myself from a Portuguese restaurant in close to 10 years. I really wanted to love this restaurant. Sadly, the service was so horrible that it was really hard to overcome and the food didn't really make up for the service. We were a party of 4 on a Wednesday night. We ordered calamari, 2 beers, and a pitcher of sangria. 2 of us were splitting the sangria and I have to say that it didn't even come close to the sangria I have had in Miami. Miami has them beat for sangria 100%. The calamari was served room temperature so not so good.

We all had the house steak. It was very good. However, again, not pipping hot. Just room temperature. I guess everything is just sitting to long waiting for the servers to bring it out. The potatoes on the steak were the best part. The steak was cooked right and tender but the egg was overcooked. 

We did get a good laugh however. One of our guests asked for ketchup when the food was delivered. The server actually brought the ketchup when the person was on their last bite close to 20 minutes later. Luckily, we all had a good sense of humor and thought it was hilarious. 

Sadly I would not reccomend this place. It was nothing great and the service was well below what is acceptable."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've tried this place and the second time I've been disappointed. I chalked the first time down to a bad order ( the Suckling pig - fatty and utterly unflavourful). Next time I got the battered cod and their speciality - BBQ chicken which were also huge disappointments. Even the chili sauce they give you could not help the dried, bland and fatty bird. The service is also bad - but everyone already knows that.
I would come here only for drinks in the summer because their patio is quite fabulous - shaded by trees  complete with water feature."}
{"text":"Bairrada Churrasqueira Another Tonque Twister With Great Food

Notes:  The service at the Mississauga location is under par, though the food is still good.

With its three locations this Portuguese Restaurant is synonymous with great food, enjoyed in a sociable atmosphere.  Many associate Portuguese food only with the many little rotisserie chicken places that dot the city, but the cuisine is so much deeper then that.  Hearty dishes of salt fish and potato, roasted whole suckling pig, fresh seafood aplenty and some damn good fried pork rinds are just a few worth mentioning.  Avoid falling in to your comfort zone, leave the rotisserie chicken with the tasty red sauce, the rice and the potato balls in the coup and try something fabulous and new.  Want to know where to start?  Well check out my appetizer only choices below.

Portuguese cuisine is also known for this dish.  Caldo Verde.  It is Kale soup, however it can be made with many different types of greens.  It has the consistency of Chinese corn soup, a light flavor, is made with chorico and is a flavorful starter.
  
Can anyone say cheese heaven.  Queijo Fresco or fresh Portuguese cheese reminiscent of a formed ricotta served with the famous tasty red sauce or Piri-Piri.  Piri-Piri is a chili based sauce and always has tons of flavor.  The cheese is refreshing, clearly fresh and a cheese lovers delight.  Just like ricotta, it is perfect with just about anything.  You have to try this.  

Portuguese cuisine is also known for its baked goods and breads.  I ate the cheese with the bread and bit of the Piri-Piri.  So good.

Their famous flaming sausage.  It is a chorizo style sausage set on fire with Portuguese moonshine in the clay vessel above just enough to grill the outside.  The aromas coming from the sizzling and crackling sausage was just beautiful. 

Sagres is Portuguese Beer.  It was light, high carbonation and reminded me of a classic lager."}
{"text":"This place has it all; great food , excellent service,cozy surrounds and very reasonable prices. Located on College at Havelock has a lot of local support.Well established and very BUSY, so book ahead for evening reservation. I recommend all the seafood, chicken dishes and suckling pig. There is a better than average wine list and good local pints. Over all the best place to eat on College."}
{"text":"Horrendous experience with the catering from Bairrada Churrasqueira we ordered for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday. It was a large order. A leitao (suckling pig), BBQ chicken, bacalhau, rice, potatoes, salad, grilled veg, natas do ceu pudding. Even chafing dishes to keep everything warm. Delivery was guaranteed by 1:30 pm - the plan was to serve lunch at 2. 

At 1:30 nothing has arrived and not a word from Bairrada. We call. Finally around 2 we connect with someone who has no answers and mixes us up with another delivery. Guests - senior citizens - have begun to leave after the light appetizers run out. 

We are then shunted from one person to another on the phone for 40 minutes - no one has a clear answer. The meal finally arrives at 2:45! Surely this is the end of the tale. But oh no, it gets worse. 

The grilled veg isn't grilled at all. It's frozen veg - probably California mix - a lot of it still frozen or uncooked in the centre! The leitao which turned out to be delicious is unfortunately carelessly charred to a crumble in delicate spots like the ears. They've delivered the wrong dessert - Creme Caramel. To be fair, the potatoes, chicken and bacalhau are very good. 

We call Carlos the manager for refunds on the chafing dishes (useless with a delivery this late - we had to serve right away), and on the wrong dessert and to ask for some kind of compensatory discount on the disastrously late delivery. This request is made with tremendous courtesy. Carlos responds with the ludicrous demand that we return the entire meal immediately! He makes no apologies for anything, actually attempts to transfer (!) blame and becomes completely unreasonable.

It is only when my law school nephew firmly reminds him of the breach of contract that a such a ridiculously late delivery constitutes, that he suddenly goes all mushy on us and says we can \"pay whatever was in our hearts.\" By then, his utter disregard for even the merest glimmer of customer service, has efficiently destroyed any goodwill we might have had. 

Still we remain decent - we just took off the price of the chafing dishes and the wrong dessert and sent the payment back with the delivery man. 

Only to hear that the family member who had placed the order had received an odd voicemail from Carlos, half passive-aggressive pleading and the other half in effect banning her from every single Bairrada Churrasqueira. We've retained the recording of course. It is a reminder to us how one frontline manager can destroy the reputation of an entire organization if he has the wrong attitude.

Whatever you do don't order catering from them. And if you do eat there, don't mention me - you'll probably get banned too. :-)"}
{"text":"What a disaster, I ordered Robalo, (striped bass) and was told it's sold out, they asked if I would like dourada (sea bream) so i said ok, 45 min later it arrives like it just came out of the Black Sea.

I'm appalled that they would think I would eat a fish beyond recognition.

I won't be back and to the owners son Denis, invest in a proper manager and support your staff."}
{"text":"Came here for a giant Churrisco meal with my girlfriend. Had no idea that they were a chain. Had two absolutely massive Chicken meal takeouts to go. They were delicious with lots of rice, potatoes and piri-piri for the Chicken. We ate about half of it for lunch, then fried the rice and chicken bits for breakfast the next morning. This still left us with 25% of our meal, which I took for lunch the next day. Over all 3 meals about of two takeout chicken dinners! Amazing"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended by my cousin, so we went to give it a try while I was visiting the big t-dot. We were early so the place was fairly empty, but by the time we left, it was packed and people were waiting outside!

The place itself is actually a lot larger than it looks from the outside, our servers was nice but really busy by the end, and their sangria was delicious. The only thing I knew about Portuguese food was Portuguese curry that's normally served in Chinese restaurants, so I figured this would be the best place to learn something new.

I wish I had read the yelp reviews beforehand so I would know what to order, but since the restaurant pick was on a whim I had no choice but to fend for myself with the menu. We ended up sharing three plates (the tiger shrimp, cod, and red snapper). We also ordered their cheese appetizer and calamari appetizer. The cheese is fantastic, it's so mild and goes great with that chili sauce they give you. The cod came out dry, and the red snapper was extremely buttery, but the shrimp was fantastic. 

Overall, it's a decent experience for someone who's never had anything remotely close to authentic Portuguese food. If you've never been and wanted to try, this may be the place to start."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and the food was decent so I decided to bring my parents here for their first Portuguese chicken experience. When we walked in we were greeted immediately and the gentleman was very polite. There was a 20 min wait so we had a chance to stand by the kitchen and watch them cook. This is where the experience went sour. We watched the food handler, who was wearing gloves I might add, cash customers out while wearing the same latex gloves he handled the food with. Instead of removing the gloves then touching the filthy money, he kept the gloves on, cashed the patrons out giving them change then proceeded to dip his hands in a bucket full of meat and put the meat on the grill without proper hand washing!!! Not only did one cook do this we saw this happen repeatedly. Already pretty grossed out we decided to eat. The chicken was dry and the sauce was way too salty. Our bread was cold and the service was pretty crappy. They also served some guy at a table closely, way too much booze and he sat at a table giving everyone the finger while he laughed to himself. I will definitely not come here again or recommend it to anyone.

FYI they've received warnings in the past by health inspectors."}
{"text":"Ok. Never thought about going here but we said why not. After looking at the menu it looked tasty so we decided to stay. Ordered the prime rib and meat skewer plates. Server was friendly and gave us delicious bountiful bread. So tasty. Then the meals came. My man gave the prime rib a 5/10. Rice was nasty and French fries very garbage. The steak was over well done and that's ridiculous since he asked for medium. My meat skewer was alright I gave it a 7/10. The meats were all overcooked. It's obvious this is how Portuguese cook their food....My rice and parisienne *mini potatoes* was saved because I drenched it with red sauce that made it all somewhat tasty which my man refused to have. We said we would give it another chance. Next time I'm trying the seafood and he's definitely NOT having the prime rib!!"}
{"text":"I was told this place had good Portuguese food so I agreed to go tonight.  What an incredible disappointment and waste of time and money.  The place was not even a third full but we got very slow service all night.  Food arrived slow and at best, room temperature. They never gave us our ordered salad so we cancelled it.  They never refilled our water pitcher.  They \"ran out\" of spoons when we asked for some to use as serving cutlery.  They did not clear our dishes even when they were full of clam and crab shells.    Then our waiter, Roberto, disappeared and none of the other three servers would help us.  My friend told me the portions were much smaller then previous visits and the sauce was extremely salty.  My friend won't be back there again either.  If they used to be good, I believe they now deserve to go out of business .  I will not even go to their other locations even though I love Portuguese food."}
{"text":"Our waitress was Natalia. I've never been to a restaurant where I felt so comfortable with the restaurant staff before. She was super friendly and made perfect recommendations for us. We even tried the dessert she suggested - and we RARELY order dessert when we go out.

Food was delicious (though I could've used some rice with the jumbo prawns) and we LOVED the patio. I told the husband we should put a mini picnic table in our backyard when we renovate!

I look forward to visiting again the next time we're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. The attendants are very helpful and were in a very good mood last time I went there. The food is pretty good and not very expensive. Definitely worth checking out, specially if you like beef."}
{"text":"I like it here. Huge patio, waiters are so friendly and the portions are huge for the price. It's just a neighborhood bbq chicken place, if you're expecting fine dining you're going to be let down."}
{"text":"Ok - I have never written a review and with a heavy heart I feel I need to do this. Coming from Portuguese heritage a genuinely love to promote the country, food, culture to my friends at any turn. 

We arrived at the place on Saturday night at 7:30pm. Confusion ensued at the door- two lists: 1 for inside / 1 for outside. Placed on both and surprisingly we were seated by 7:50 pm on the patio. We were thrilled. We place out order at 8:05 pm and received our cold appetizers promptly. 

What transpired after that was the most unbelievable restaurant experience of our lives. We waited over an hour and a half for our main course. Clearly there was something seriously wrong with the operation. Our waiter although pleasant and sympathetic was unable to even at the 1.5 hour mark give us any idea as to when our food would be up. 

We all- having never done this before had no choice but to get up and leave at the 1 hour and 45 minute mark. This is the worst experience of kitchen service we have ever had both  in Toronto or anywhere else for that matter. 

So a word of caution: stay away for this place during peak hours or be prepared to wait/ drink your face off or eat your fingers! A colossal disappointment for a true fan of the joint and its cuisine. 

We ended up going for Korean and we were seated and fed within 15 minutes. We all wondered if we would have still been waiting at Bairrada Churrasqueira for our food. Ugh..."}
{"text":"I love the location in Toronto, so I was delighted to see a location in Mississauga pretty close to the movie theatre. This place seems a bit newer but continues the whole laid-back casual dining feel that the Toronto location has. 

When we were sat, the server put down bread and butter, which was nice. The bread was hard as a rock, though, possibly because we sat down for dinner at 10pm. 

My friend went for the house steak and I went for the BBQ chicken. Her house steak filled an entire pie plate and was covered in thick rounds of fried potatoes and pickled veggies. She said it was pretty good. My bbq chicken was and entire half a chicken served with rice and parisian potatoes. I felt as if the food wasn't as good here as the Toronto location, but like I said. We got there just before it closed. The chicken and beef were a bit overdone, but still tasty. I found everything really salty. 

The service was friendly and very efficient and the prices were fair. We both paid $25 each, tax, tip and a 1/2L of wine between us and left with enough leftovers for another meal."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for more than 10 years now, and I finally decided that I should probably write a review since I like it so much.
This is an old school Portuguese grillhouse, serving authentic Portuguese home-style dishes. Service can be spotty - some staff have pretty weak English, so make sure you get the order straight. Also, don't expect polished French service, this is the more no-nonsense \"here's your food\" service.
I have worked my way through most of the menu over the years, and I have my favourites, thought I always make sure to check out the daily specials, because that's where the gems lie. Whatever grilled meat I choose, I wind up bathing it in their delicious house made piri piri sauce. While their chicken has never failed me, I am more partial to the quail, the suckling pig or one of the innumerable cod dishes. I also prefer the potato chips to the parisienne potatoes, but the rice sops up juices and sauce very well.
The appetizers are great, but beware of filling up too much and not being able to enjoy as much of the mains. I rally like most of them, so if you are with a group, you could try the platter and get a sampling of the cheese, sausage, peppers and squid in one shot.
I find that they have a bit of a heavy hand with seafood, tending to overcook and over season them (much like my Mom used to!) so those dishes are a real blast from the past for me. The wine list is loaded with Portuguese gems, so if you don't know much about them this is your chance to learn (order the Vila Regia and impress your friends with a great choice at a great price!).
I've never had room for dessert, so I can't tell you about them, but others seem pretty happy.
My challenge is always the same - having to choose from the tantalizing specials or the set menu. Either way, I leave happy and full, and my wallet isn't crying either."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. LOVE the chicken.  I also like the potato balls, and their rice... obviously, I'm a fan!  It can get busy, so be prepared to be patient and wait."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Bairrada.  We enjoyed the food the first time, and decided to go there for dinner on Sunday.

It was not really full, but seemed to be very chaotic, with a large group leaving, but this seemed to take a very long time.  The waiter finally showed us to a table (most tables were empty at this point which is why it was surprising how long it took for them to get a table ready).  

We ordered mixed meats grilled with vegetables on a stick for me, and a steak and a small salad for my better half. After a reasonable delay the food came, smelling great and huge portions. The salad never made an appearance.

My entree was served with little, round roasted potatoes and over a bed of rice. Although delicious, the potatoes were not very hot. The grilled meat and vegetables were very nice, but the rice was very disappointing. It was dry. So dry in fact that it contained rock hard pieces of rice, which most likely came about from excessive re-heating. This was a particular disappointment for me, since I love the way the Portuguese serve rice.

My partners steak was huge, tasty and cooked to be tender, but the cut was of inferior quality with a lot of fat in it.  His opinion was that they did well with the cut, but that it would be impossible to serve a better cut for the very reasonable price they charged.

Overall - I give them three stars because I did not find the dining experience to be that entrancing.  Their prices are very reasonable and their portions gargantuan.

Would we go again? Possibly, if in the area and no other options were available.  

Others might really enjoy the place.

 It has the feel of a Southern European Taverna - long rows of bare tables, lots of large screen TVs geared to Portuguese sports and news, a long bar where patrons can sit and drink and watch the TVs and chat to to the bartender. A friendly home away from home for our Portuguese friends, just not really our scene."}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences here. The bitoque and bife a casa were quite tasty, but the suckling pork and churrasco chicken.... not the best I've ever had. Cold and dry from what I remember. Knowing Portuguese food and churrasco the way I do, I cant say I am a huge fan of the chicken here. I've been to this location 4 times now I believe? And to be honest, my feelings on it are quite mixed. There are hits and misses. Some times fall better than others. One thing that is gorgeous though is the back patio. Amazing for summer nights and feasts :P"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I love Portuguese chicken.  I was only recently introduced to it last summer by a friend at work, and the moment that chicken and piri-piri sauce hit my lips it was love.  Little did I know at that point that I've actually loved it for a long time unknowingly - when I lived in Richmond Hill, I loved going to Nandos, but we rarely did.  I didn't realize at the time that it was Portuguese.

So when my dining group decided to try a Portuguese restaurant, I was pretty excited.  I read the reviews online and was looking forward to it.  But...it was only okay for me.  The piri piri was good, but not great.  The chicken was tasty, but not amazing.  And MAN ALIVE was it ever loud in there.  I couldn't hear what was being said at the other end of the table, and there were only 7 of us there.  The service was just okay too.  

Now that I've found an amazing brunch place, I think my next mission will be to find the best Portuguese chicken in the city.  Onward!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner with another couple and, despite having one of the better Bife a Casas I have had since Nosa Cassa in AAA Mall at Kennedy and Clarence, Bairrada really let me down on a number of matters. First, I didnt say best Bife a Casa as the temperature of my steak all over the place as it was well down to medium on the outside and very rare in the middle when I ordered medium rare. Ive seen this when I order 23 oz or larger steaks and find the rare middle normal, but not a 12 to 16 oz and not this rare. To make it worse, I tried to break the yoke to get that rich ,gooey goodness all over my potatoes and steak to get very little liquid as it was overcooked. They did do right as there was a nice amount of fresh cut, fried sliced potatoes that were seasoned nicely on a pretty good tasting steak. Second, we were forced to pay on a single bill as our second server informed us that we had to say that we would need to split the bill at the beginning and it was too late- this is something most restaurants ask you from the beginning if they see you are a group and not a family if they do have a strange system. Found it very lazy of this server to not even try to do the math as he probably would have gotten a better tip between two bills instead of one bill between two couples not planning to play together. Finally, everything was all over the place as we constantly had to wait for our drinks as their was a disconnect between the bar server and main server (the bar server being the second server I referred to and more or less became our server as the other gentleman was extremely busy with multiple tables). They were pretty busy as it was a Friday night, but I would have expected better systems to avoid waits for something basic like refills. The Coup De Grace for us was when the second server tried to recover for forgetting drinks by pushing someone else drink across to the table to someone else wanting the same drink, not realizing we all ordered the drink and he only brought out some of the order. Id go at the fact we waited almost an hour for our appetizers, but I saw that they really do their best to keep up as the kitchen is undersized for the number of the seats. 

I can say that they got the three stars as I have been to a lot worse places and I atleast felt I got some value for what I spent as the portions were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've never eaten in but we've always ordered for take out to feed a group.  This place is great for that reason alone.  You can feed a group of 10 to 15 for like 60-80 bucks.

It's about 11 bucks for a whole chicken then you get potatoes, rice, vegetables etc and whatever extras you want like the custard desserts.  

My favorite are the bbq sardines.  They are absolutely full of flavor but they take a while to make so if you want them you're best to know you'll have to wait a bit longer.

I always ask for extra piri piri sauce because it goes so well with the chicken or whatever meat/fish you're having."}
{"text":"I still remember when I was first introduced to Portuguese food. I always thought it was nothing special. Ok in a way, the menu isn't going to blow your mind. You'll find things like grilled chicken, steak, and fish. These are staples in nearly every restaurant. What impressed me were 2 things: a) price and b) taste. 

Compared to other western style restaurants like Boston Pizza, Jack Astor etc, Bairrada is extremely cheap. And the portions are huge. 

Secondly, the taste is awesome. If you thought Swiss Chalet chicken is good, you need to come here. The chicken is both better tasting and cheaper than Swiss Chalet. Swiss Chalet chicken is dry and I feel they add too much salt. Only the outer layer has any real taste. The interior requires you to use the swiss chalet sauce. Bairrada's chicken on the other hand are much more juicy all the way through. IMO, piri piri sauce beats the hell out of Swiss Chalet sauce any day. Portuguese style chicken has made me a new man. When I think chicken, I think of places like Bairrada. If you don't want chicken, they have equally good steak and fish. 

The atmosphere is not extravagant, but I'm there for the food! The atmosphere isn't classy, but it's perfectly fine for socializing with friends. You'd feel comfortable just being yourself in places like this."}
{"text":"Best patio in Toronto, best hot sauce, huge portions and cheap vino verde. I come here all the time!"}
{"text":"great Portuguese food, from fish to chicken, everything tastes great. Make sure to ask for some extra Peri-Peri sauce. The servers are really friendly and can make changes even when it's not on the menu. The best time to go is in the summer, they open up the backyard and place tables for you to sit outside, nice spot to chill for diner with friends."}
{"text":"Seems like this place has stepped up their game, or i have just been really lucky, but i thought it deserved an update,  the food has actually been great all my past visits"}
{"text":"Bairrada is a gem. I've walked pass this place on several occasions and never once paid it any attention. I regret those days.

I chose to visit Bairrada Churrasqueira on a whim after visiting a closed Barque Smokehouse. At first glance, Bairrada is just another family owned independent restaurant. At second glance, it was a restaurant dedicated to the Portuguese community and culture. I felt like the only non-Portuguese patron in the restaurant... and it felt good. Good because they treated me like one of their own. The restaurant was packed from the front of the house, all the way to where I sat on the back patio. It was such a great atmosphere. The people around were all having a good time, sitting around family and friends, sharing food and laughs. I loved the restaurant the moment I sat down. It was like I was invited to someone's backyard bbq for a family reunion. Wonderful.

So the sun was out, the skies were clear and the trees provided us with shade. The food was awesome as well. All family style portions, but also good for an extra hungry individual. They had crowns beside menu items that represented customer favourites. I had a bbq chicken platter with rice, potatoes and olives. My friend had the prime rib with the same trimmings. 
Although we finished the plates ourselves, we both needed long Sunday naps after wards. I dragged out our conversations though. i wanted to stay longer and enjoy the weather, people and friendly conversations with our servers. Even when the servers dropped plates on the ground, everyone would yell OPA! and made the situation so much less embarrassing. 

I loved it here. I will go back soon. The food is very reasonably priced and the portions are very generous. The recommendations, service and overall atmosphere are what make this place a 5."}
{"text":"I was craving for some Portuguese food. My friend said this place is quite good. The restaurant interior was simple. They got a semi - patio that have small stage for the live keyboards player  (that's where we were seated). All the dishes and cutlery were placed on every tables before the customers arrived. Each plate has a paper mat that got a bunch of advertisements on it (clever idea to make extra income). 

I got the frango no churrasco (BBQ chicken) and the Queijo Fresco (Portuguese fresh cheese). The chicken was too dry. Rice and potatoes tasted okay. Its my first time trying out fresh cheese. The cheese, I found it too \"fresh\"  and tasteless even after I thought of trying to completely covered the cheese with the \"hot sauce\" they provided on the side.  Hot sauce wasn't spicy at all. 

Overall, I was really hungry so it wasn't so bad. I did end up finishing my plate of BBQ chicken. And it was nice having live keyboards player, playing while I ate. And a random sweet little girl from Portugal kept on trying to spend time with me. She kept on eating my olives from the fresh cheese dish after I gave her permission to. I didn't mind. She's too sweet."}
{"text":"Bom comida, or translated to English good food. But it could have been better and here is how; the steak which I ordered medium rare comes  soaked in a delicious gravy no issues there, topped with a fried egg,house cut potatoes, and black olives,the meal it's self is called bife a casa. But I digress, the issue I had was with my steak was that it was a bit charred(on the sides, I'm not counting the obvious grill marks). I also felt the steak and gravy could have been served separate of each other, so to allow the customer to regulate how much gravy they want to use and which items they will use the gravy on(I didn't not end up using all my gravy,complete waste)If these issues didn't exist, I would rate the meal a 5 but for these reasons they lose 2 stars. The drink I ordered was blue lagoon, and in addition to not tasting how I remember when I use to sneak into bars as younger,and it wasn't BLUE!!! It photographs as blue but in person it is greener than El Chapo's garden. The customer service was one of the upsides I can't find any criticism about this because they where just that nice. Next time I will try and get the modifications I want."}
{"text":"A few bites from our full review - 
\"We couldn't resist the urge to stand up and walk around a bit. Their waterfall, little bridge and trellis scene were poetic - a little oasis in the city.\"
\"Our waiter, Jerry, had a charming Portuguese accent and was very enthusiastic about all the dishes. He made a fun presentation for the Chourico a Bombeiro, as they set a few sausages on fire and cut them for us.\"
\"Finally, for dessert we had their Nata do Cei - cream from heaven. It came topped with some cinnamon and looked like rice pudding to the naked eye. The angelic taste was present - smooth, with areas of grainy sense of breadiness, it was light and pleasant to the palate.\""}
{"text":"We went for dinner on Saturday and brought our 2 year old grand son.

There was a 50th anniversary party being set up but no sign on the door to advise of this.   They were going to use the entire dining room for this event and had outdoor seating only. 

We stood at the door for 15 minutes waiting to be seated.

We were advised of the anniversary party and decided to sit outside.

Unfortunately they had few servers on that night.  It took 15 minutes to get a drink and 20 minutes to get our food.

Our \"service\" ended there.  We did not see our server again.

We went and got our own condiments and napkins.  We did not get a refill on our drinks.

We had to hunt the server down to get the bill.

When we advised the Manager of our experience he shrugged and told us about the anniversary party.

Here is a clue - if you have no desire to serve your customers please close your doors.  

Miserable.  Not returning."}
{"text":"The food here is great and they give you ginormous portions!  In my previous visits, I had the classic chicken with potatoes and rice! Can't lose with that one... I love their hot sauce. Yum yum.  Also had the pleasure of having the house steak, T-bone, grilled cod, grilled grouper and the roasted pork.  All so tasty.  However, the grilling is inconsistent.  The last time my grouper was grilled just within the right scale, not perfect but ok.  The next time I had it, it was under-cooked.  With respect to the place itself, it's has a small dine-in and two large patios, one smoking and one non-smoking.  It gets really busy here and the service is not that great because it is slow and they mess up your food sometimes.  The last time I was here, they mixed up the cod with a sea bass.  Anyway, despite the negatives I presented, I will be back! Great price, portions, good patio and generally good food!"}
{"text":"I had to organize a lunch for a film crew during a daylong meeting we had. I chose Bairrada on the advise of a Portuguese friend, We were in a bit of a rush and they accommodated us beautifully. The food was fantastic and the owner came out to speak with us for a while; before  we new it we were doing shots with the owner and everyone had an amazing time. It was voted our best Technical Survey Lunch of the year buy the crew!
Great meal and very fun."}
{"text":"Dried out chicken, greasy potatoes, oil soaked fish, and absent service. Won't be going back ever again. Epic fail 3 times in a row. Only positive is their patio."}
{"text":"We get take out from this place a couple times a month, and actually eat in probably once or twice a year during the summer when we can enjoy their awesome backyard patio and their affordably priced beers.

The quality is usually pretty darn good, but I'll admit things have been inconsistent at times. If you plan on eating in, probably best to call in advance to make sure you can get a table as this place is pretty busy on most nights. They also raised their prices by about a dollar on most items last year, but its still all a good value and nothing is unreasonably priced, so consider this more of a warning than anything that the prices won't match their website.

As for the food, we regularly get the chicken dinner (half chicken with rice and parisienne potatoes) and the chicken is great, but I admit the rice and potatoes are pretty bland and even a bit oily at times. Once you throw some of their homemade hot sauce on top it flavours it nicely though, and it all tastes pretty darn good on the reheat as well. I've found mixed results on their caesar salad, as the one time I ate in the restaurant it was super fresh and had big chunks of bacon in it, where when getting it for takeout the salad was mediocre with little to no bacon and the lettuce looked like the dressing had been sitting on it all day, certainly not made even close to when I ordered it. 
Their sandwiches are also a favourite of mine though and probably what I order the most of. You can choose between chicken, veal cutlet, or pork cutlet which comes on a big portuguese bun and a side of french fries. The chicken sandwich is usually pretty darn good, but the last couple times have been a bit stingy on the chicken whereas past experiences used to find a large amount of chicken breast between the bun along with the lettuce and tomatoes.  The last time I felt like I was eating more bun than anything. Also a heads up that the veal and pork cutlets are just the bun and meat, no lettuce or tomato so I recommend adding that on as it makes a more satisfying sandwich. All in all for under $8 they are a good deal, assuming they don't skimp on the meat. 
Worth mentioning as well is to check out their little cooler by the front door for desserts. They offer little cups of various desserts like chocolate mousse and one thats a lemon with merengue and graham cracker type thing. Both are great, as well as the other random treats that I've pulled from that fridge. And I'm pretty sure they always have the classic portuguese tarts but I'm not really a fan of those in general so steer clear.

Overall, the place is an overwhelming 3 star experience. I've never been wowed but its rarely let me down either, so it will surely stay the course as a take-out regular for me."}
{"text":"We have ordered our catering for meetings from here a few times and the food was always decent!

Last week I called at 1050am, 20 minutes after they were open to place a take out order. The guy on the phone was rude when I didn't take his \"advice\" to upgrade the size of potatoes and then started snapping at me. 

He said it would be 15 to 20 minutes.

We arrived at 11:10, and the food wasn't ready until 11:30.

The guy and other people at the shop were much nicer in person but still 40 minutes wait at a take out place is too long. 

The food is good but there are tastier ones nearby with less attitude. 

Also they don't do family combos so it was a bit pricier than other ones."}
{"text":"Two words. Red. Sauce. 

I've had catered food from Bairrada on multiple occasions, and each time, I tell myself that I have to give the actual restaurant a visit for its BBQ chicken. I ended up finally visiting on the morning of Portugal's World Cup game vs USA. The staff were noticeably excited in their Portugal t-shirts. The service was great, our server was very friendly and was great at making conversation. 

On to the food - we tried the BBQ chicken (a must-try), the flaming sausage, and the lechon (roasted pig). The chicken at Bairrada is likely their most popular dish. It's cooked Portuguese-style and is served with their signature red sauce. They called it a mild-hot sauce and advised us to try it with pretty much any dish. While the chicken is just a tiny bit on the dry side, the sauce is the perfect remedy. 

The flaming sausage was quite a unique appetizer - it came partially cooked on a flaming pig-shaped grill (as you'll see in some of the pictures). We were given tongs and the opportunity to cook the sausage as we wished. It was not as juicy as the more popular types of sausage in the city, but that didn't take anything away from the taste. I'd still definitely recommend it. 

Lastly, the lechon. Being a Filipino, I'm always tempted to order lechon whenever I see it on a menu. The Portuguese style of lechon is not as crispy as the Filipino style, and they also like to use a slightly different sauce. I personally was not much of a fan of it, as my favourite part of lechon is the crispy skin!

If I had to say one negative thing about the restaurant, it is not very accessible. The washrooms are tucked away in the basement (similar to most establishments downtown) and may be difficult to get to for customers that have trouble walking. Not so much a con, but it's not something you expect from a restaurant in a big lot in Mississauga. 

Tip: Order the small size if your dish selection is given the option. The portions here are HUGE! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here around 8pm on a sunday night and waited about 15 minutes for a table, however it was a table by the door and the cold draft comes in every time the door opens and its cold and unpleasant. 

Yes, service is quite slow here, they seem to forget about you for a while after you put the menus down. The food is hit or miss here. The appetizer platter had a good variety and a large serving for the price, the grilled calamari was tender, the cheese was a large slab and a big pile of roasted red peppers, every thing felt kind of cold though (but it could have been the draft)

The chicken was mediocre at best, it was on the dry side. The little roasted potatoes were good though. Their tiger shrimp were great, the shrimp were huge and the sauce was rich, buttery and had lots of seafood flavour and it came out hot, the portion was really good for the price. The sea bass was also grilled great and was not dry at all. but the vegetables were overcooked and a bit mushy. Their egg tarts are also ok, didn't feel the freshest but it was fine and I love all egg tarts so can't complain. 

The service did get better at the end of the night when there was less people. The place was busy and lots of large tables of families. Overall this place is ok, great for families and a good deal for the price but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I'm rating this place based on their chicken, rice and potatoes only. Everything gets a passing mark in my books except for their hot sauce or pri-pri whatever you wish to call it. 

I've been on the hunt for the best Portuguese chicken spot downtown for a while now. After experiencing Mario's barbecue chicken in Mississauga for the bigger part of my life- never thought it would be this hard to find a place I can fall back on hangover days..

The chicken is propeprly cooked and not undercooked unlike some of the other places. 
Their rice is standard- nothing to brag about. Their potatoes were well cooked and soft. 

Definitely going to be returning! Hopefully they stay consistent. 

Will most likely stop at another place I have in mind to get the hot sauce -works better with this meal."}
{"text":"HUGE!! MASSIVE!! EXTREMELY LARGE!

Ok, now that I've gotten your attention. Clean your dirty mind! I was talking about the backyard patio at this place. You would never guess, but it probably fits 100 people. No joke. There are picnic tables and benches, so not the most comfy, but it is a relaxed homey feel, the waitresses are super nice, and the food is hearty and cheap. They give you big portions, mostly for $10-$12. The churrasco chicken was $10 and came with 4 pieces, rice and potatoes. (cause who needs veggies when you can have starch?! Am I right?) 

I want to go back to watch soccer, but I can't miss work. They have TV screens in the backyard, and come 10am today, I know it's gonna be a mob scene for the Brazil/Portugal World cup game. Crazy fun with cheap yummy food."}
{"text":"Top notch authentic atmosphere and vibe. And SO MUCH food! The table was ready in seconds and came complete with a basket of assorted breads. The service was great and the food came very fast. The BBQ chicken is a can't miss ... however mine was a little dry."}
{"text":"This place has amazing authentic Portuguese food, fresh and good portions.  The beef a casa is amazing with it's homemade sauce, and you can switch the french fries to the rustic round potatoes which are my fvourite.  The pina coladas are good too.  The price is worth the food, average prices for great food.   The decor isn't great but wait until the summer when the backyard patio is open.  Great for birthdays.  Ps-the sangrias here are amazing."}
{"text":"Great seafood dishes amongst others, very traditional the downfall is that it is way to busy! Lovely patio as well."}
{"text":"The food it hit or miss, but when it's a hit it's a huge it. The churrasqueira chicken is always great, and the hot sauce only makes it better. If you're picky about steak temperatures it probably isn't for you but the steaks are so homey and flavourful and the thick-cut, chip-style fries are unreal.
The service really stinks though. I once had an amazing server, a young guy who spoke English and Portuguese, but every other time i make sure I go with my aunts or dad so someone can speak Portuguese to make sure we get decent service."}
{"text":"Bairrada has really good Portuguese food. We couldn't help ourselves and we ordered
- Sausage
- Roasted suckling pig
- BBQ chicken

We jammed everything in our mouths. The only conversation we had were MMMs and it's so good. The sausage was served on a pig shaped troth and it was flaming. It was so kitschy but so cool! The pig and the chicken came with seasoned rice and roasted potatoes. We made sure to douse our meat in the tasty piri-piri sauce.

For dessert, I opted to have something called Cream of the Heavens. It' was trifle like with different layers of whipped cream and custard topped with cinnamon. With some Portuguese coffee (complete with sugar from Portugal), it was nice way to end our heavy meal.

Service is attentive, warm and friendly. Food comes out rather quickly. We really enjoyed Bairrada and will definitely come back again. 

P.S. February 2009 is their 10th year anniversary so between Monday to Thursday, they take 10% of your bill. Bonus!"}
{"text":"we came here riiiight as they were about to close on a pretty busy friday night. They were nice enough to seat us and give us what was left in the kitchen lol. We got the 1/2 chicken plate. It was a giant plate of food!! Not sure if they were clearing out whatever was left at the end of the night or if thats the regular portion but wow! The chicken was soo yummy and came with a nice big bowl of the hot sauce. and the platter itself had a nice bed of rice and potates swimming around in the chicken juices. They are literally like yummy pops of buttery goodness. (i had started atkins that week so it was the first time i was getting carbs in a week... those potatoes were my crack that night!) lol  Anyways super delicious food, affordable prices and the outdoor seating in the back is great on a late summer night."}
{"text":"No comment on the food - because they basically told me to get lost since I was dining alone. ;) Waiter gave me a look and said \"This table is occupied (by anyone but you)\", walked away and never came back. - hey thanks a lot! Service seemed terrible overall, I'd avoid unless you are ready to be ignored at a restaurant where you pay and tip. 

Btw I then walked out and tried 'cafeteria' down the street, and I'm SO glad that I did."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out hear a few times and it was fine. 
Yesterday I waited and regulars came in after me and they would serve them
Right away and ignore me. I didn't even get any eye contact. 
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great spot in the city for Portuguese cuisine.  Very reasonably (cheep) priced. 

The chicken is incredible and so is the hot sauce that goes along with it.  We also had the grilled halibut stake which dispite being a little dry was very flavourful.

The backyard patio is the place to be but they also do take out."}
{"text":"Go directly through the restaurant into the perfect backyard oasis. Had the chicken and it was expertly cooked. Stick to their grilled meats, seafood can be inconsistent. Chicken and pork are always fantastic.
Definitely will be back for a World Cup match. Outdoor televisions!"}
{"text":"Been there before and remember it being good, but I'd probably had a few drinks.  Went there today and the food wa just ok. Big portions. Low prices.  A bit greasy and nothing to remark about.  Also, the place is a bit dirty."}
{"text":"Swiss Chalet got nothing on Portuguese Chicken! 

It's been about nine years since my last visit here and now I remember why it's taken me this long to go back. The last time I was here I remember it being so ghetto kinda like a cafeteria setting almost and now it looks more like a food court setting you'd see at a mall. My little beef with the seating arrangement is that you are so close to other people that it kinda ruins your meal a little. For one I'm not one to ease drop on someone elses conversation or do I like hearing other peoples conversation but it's impossible not to ignore it b/c you are that damn close to other people. 

Besides the seating arrangement the interior looked very nice and clean. The bar area adds a nice touch to it with sports, mostly soccer, playing on the screens. I wanna come back here just to see what it is like during the World Cup! I betcha this place would be crazy during that time. 

The one item that stands out here is the BBQ chicken. The chicken is very well done, cooked properly and the flavour was nice. But when you add that hot sauce that they supply it makes the chicken so much sweeter. The white meat on the chicken was very good not dry at all like almost every other place I've been to. The one item not to get is the sausage. Presentation wise it's served on a pig that's on fire, very wonderful site to see where it gets everyones attention. There is alot of meat in that sausage but the flavour wasn't the greatest and it was very dry that we didn't even finish half of it. 

I don't know when the next time I'll come back here maybe another 9 years but who knows if I happen to be craving Portuguese chicken and I happen to be around the area I'll grab some for take out. 

Items to definitely get: 

- BBQ Chicken"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Had the Bacalhau (cod) which was super dry and salty. For 17$ it came with a wonderful side of 2 pieces of broccoli and a delicious bland potato. The others that got the chicken said no better.

Service was pretty bad. The place seems disorganized. The only \"redeeming\" feature was the patio but even then I wouldn't come here for drinks because the sangria was watery, and the beer was coors light.

Never again friends!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening at around 7, the place was busy, but we were seated promptly within 2 minutes! We had the veal cutlet and prime rib steak dinners which were good, the sides were okay, nothing to brag home about in terms of the rice and the potatoes) the cut of meat wasn't one of the best i've had it still had lots of fat on it, seasoning was good (light salt and pepper! I had to send the steak back to be cooked some more as it was still red and raw when it came to the table but i enjoyed it!     Service was really quick and friendly, they do work very hard to make dinners happy!!    Not a fan of the cafeteria seating and being so close to the other tables, which makes it look like everyone is dinning together at one long table..    would i go back??  Yes if i 'll be in that area again looking for some affordable tasty meal! Prices are very good, 2 steak dinners  with two cocktails and 2 coffees was surprinsingly just 43$ plus tip!!"}
{"text":"I've been here both for a humble midweek frango (BBQ chicken) and for a multi-course Portuguese feast served family style including suckling pig, baked beans, roast potatoes -- the works.  Both meals were equally satisfying and affordable.  I've always felt that Portuguese food has a smaller palette of flavours than other mediterranean cuisines, but fortunately these folks are complete masters of all its tones and consistently turn out rustic comfort food at its finest.  It has piqued my curiosity about other styles of Portuguese cooking, including their version of fine dining.

Pro Tip: The blistering garlic-chili paste is killer on the frango.  I slathered that stuff on like housepaint."}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't know Portuguese food...but if this is it...it just didn't do it for me. The service was great and the huge outdoor patio area was absolutely my favorite part. The sangria...well I'd rather have the drinks here than the food. I ordered the steak medium rare...it came out blue...I suppose I should have sent it back but I tried to stick it out...maybe this was medium rare here? I'm not sure...I'm also not sure why they took the one pitcher of sangria off the bill instead of taking off the steak but it was nice that they did something."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food did not live up to its hype.

What we ate:
- Queso Fresco: (2/5) Fresh cheese with piri piri - while fresh pretty basic
- Grilled calamari: (3/5) Super duper fresh but needed more seasoning
- Chicken: Seemed to be the best option
- Steak: Huge portion looked well cooked
- Codfish: I tried some from a friend, did not really like it.

The food is greasy and lack luster. Although cost effective, I would rather eat some where else.

Note: The patio is quite large and foreign-feeling, the only reason why this place got any stars!"}
{"text":"We were craving Portuguese chicken and all our favourite spots were closed due to the holiday weekend, Sooooo... We finally decided to give this place a try! 
What a mistake. The chicken was luke warm, dry and flavourless... The rice was blahhh and the potatoes tasted like they've been soaking in dirty foot water. No joke. Such a weird rancid taste! I've never seen my husband refuse roasted  parisienne potatoes before... But today marks that day my fellow yelpers. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the service was great and the young gentleman behind the counter was helpful and had a smile on the entire time! 

Stick with Farol's, Mario's BBQ, or Brasas! Trust me!"}
{"text":"Excellent variety of Portugese foods...extensive menu with daily specials. We shared fresh cod and the house steak that was so plentiful that we both took portions home. First rate and attentive service. Would highly recommend and we will return."}
{"text":"It took a lot of hard work for my boyfriend to convince me to ever come here. I was not impressed the first time we came about two years ago. The food was mediocre, service was okay then. Today, I decided to give this place a second chance. We went in. The place was not busy at all, three groups of guests were already seated inside the restaurant and a few were seated outside the patio. My boyfriend was trying to get the staff's attention to have us seated.However, nobody seemed interested to do business with us. Two of the staff were just talking to each  at the counter, one just keep passing us by ,not even making any eye contact to acknowledge us and another came towards us, but was bewildered and instead said somebody was going to help us.
We were left standing for about three minutes or so with no one attending to us. We eventually walked out of the restaurant. I was disappointed for the second time, first was with the food, now the service.
 I made sure that I write a review for this restaurant, to remind me and inform others of our experience.
Well, I guess I have to give a rating so my review would be posted... One star is definitely being generous of me."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Servings generous, food sumptuous.  Take for what it is:  a hole in the wall but if you want great food, you have to check this place out.  I ordered the grilled chicken and it would feed at least two people.  All for $10.50 including tax.  I can't believe the other review gave it a mediocre rating because it didn't have wifi.  Jesus Christ, if you want Wifi go to a godd@m Starbucks or Timmy's.  Can't anyone just sit down, relax and enjoy a good meal without having to check their phones every other f--king minute?  No wifi.  Give me a f--king break."}
{"text":"Dropped in this afternoon while I was driving thru Mississauga. Had the BBQ chicken, which the waiter recommended as their signature dish. Great stuff! Rice was done well, chicken wasn't too dry and the hot sauce added just enough kick. 

Was tempted by other items on the menu...will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Huge back patio with tvs, bar and bench seating. Love the environment, food was mediocre in taste but prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"My friend chose Bairrada because of inSauga's recommendation for Portuguese chicken. 

We both ordered the quarter chicken for $8 with rice and potatoes. We were disappointed in the amount of chicken we got. It was more of a quarter hen size than an actual chicken. I didn't like the rice at all so I let my friend eat it. The table next to us ordered the flaming sausage. The flaming sausage looked interesting so we decided to share one as well. We were more disappointed with the sausage, especially my friend as she loves sausage. The sausage didn't taste good and it was dry.

There was nothing that we enjoyed about this place. Hopefully I will be able to find a good place for my friend to try good Portuguese chicken. Perhaps Nando's or Galito's?"}
{"text":"I have been to several other locations but I wasn't nearly as impressed; the service, food quality and price here far surpass the others.
Located just on the outskirts of Little Italy off of College it can get rather busy which makes the street parking a little irritating at times, however the food is well worth the hassle.

I have never stayed for my meal, I always opt for takeout due to time constrictions however I will say the venue has intrigued me enough to want to dine in on future visits. The interior layout is long and a little on the small side but spacious tables and seats seem to make for a comfortable and intimate dining experience. I think one of the nicest features of this restaurant is the patio, I haven't had the chance to fully check it out but it looks charming, located at the very back of the dining hall. 

The food is reliable and delicious with portion options and amazing prices.... I was actually shocked by the price for 2 half chickens, small Parisian potatoes and veggies came out to $13 something ..... IM SERIOUS! I thought it was a mistake and I'm bad with exploiting opportunities like that so I insisted they got the price wrong. I ended up leaving the rest for tip cause I was really that shocked, no joke. 
They have the BEST hot sauce too, I'm not really into super hot things, I've recently been trying spicier foods yet I'd still consider myself a novice. This hot sauce is full of flavor but not burn your mouth off bad, it has a bit of oil in it which helps to calm the heat I think but it also leads me to a negative point to make. Much of the food is on the greasier side here, they put oil in almost all their dishes which can be a bad thing; I found the veggies very oily and bland for example. However I still found the rest of the dishes savory and delectable!

Besides the excessive oil I will say that some of the chosen decor like pictures for example are a little off putting. I know it's the culture and the very thing I'm going to be consuming BUT I do not wish to see a skewered pig being roasted regardless of how tasty the dish may be after I still don't find it appetizing, but this is if course a personal thing.

My last negative point is one I make carefully as it is another personal issue and I feel doesn't directly affect the restaurant as a business. Although I do not speak Portuguese I was with someone who does and they mentioned that much of the conversation going on in the open kitchen was particularly disrespectful to customers, more so the female ones and being a woman I'm not sure how comfortable I would be dining alone in an environment like that 

Otherwise I highly recommend this place for delicious and affordable traditional Portuguese cuisine"}
{"text":"Wonderful large patio. It's a great feeling sitting outside. We ordered the calamari olives and cheese, sardines, the cod and a half chicken. First of all the portions are very large and reasonably priced. The sardines came with six absolutely huge sardines the cod was probably a good 8 ounces. I can't even explain how delicious the Piri Piri sauce is. I wanted to eat it with a spoon it was so freaking delicious. Lovely outdoor atmosphere inside was pretty standard. Everything that arrived at our table was delicious. It's a busy place with people celebrating various things. The service was fantastic. Gerry was a wonderfully attentive waiter. An authentic European feeling to this place right down to the waiters and the service.
I would recommend this to anyone who has a celebration a family gathering or date night. The finishing touch of a shot of Port was Absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"I do not get what the fuss is about this place. I realize a vegetarian at a Portuguese BBQ might sound odd but I sometimes each fish and am a sucker for a 4000 square foot patio and a place a lot of people I know said they've been too and loved. 

The patio is a good size. But there were a whole lot of smokers on it when I was there which during my meal was a bit annoying. I know, I'm outside I'm supposed to deal with it, I just found it was pretty much every table. That aside...the food. Was...according to my whole party of 7 of us...MEH. Portions are big, yes. But bland and uninteresting and overcooked - this was the consensus around the table. My bf is a meat-eating, chicken loving, bbq fiend and he was very unimpressed. Same goes for his brother and cousin. We all had leftovers but none that anyone wanted to take home.

The sangria was also not good. Mostly pop, hardly any booze - tried the red and the white and found them both lacking. SIgh. I couldn't even drink myself into a good time here.

There is NOTHING to eat for a vegetarian that doesn't eat fish - some lame tasteless cheese and hard olives was about the sum total of what was available. But I don't want to judge a place like this on their veggies options, I know that isn't why one goes to Bairrada.

So...I'm not sure what all my friends that have raved about here are thinking but this is a one time only try for me."}
{"text":"My group was really disappointed with this place having heard such wonderful things. Although the prices were fair, the food was not very good and the service was bad. It took a very long time to be acknowledged by wait staff, our food took forever to arrive, and when it did arrive we got the wrong plates.

The chicken was dry, sardines were burned, and the olives were flavourless. The free bread was excellent and the roasted potatoes were good. 

If you go, make a reservation. And don't bring a vegetarian!"}
{"text":"Food was greasy and heavy, terrific if that's what you're looking for. Fast and cheap."}
{"text":"one of my all-time faves...
great place to take 'newbies' to portuguese food...

have yet to have a bad meal - and always complemented by a reasonably-priced wine list (featuring mostly portuguese wines)

go. you will enjoy.
don't sweat stuff like parking - you're not eating in your car..."}
{"text":"Wednesday evening a group of us attended an end of the summer patio party at Bairrada Churrasqueira, which serves Portuguese cuisine.

We were greeted with pitchers of sangria.  Yum!

We were served a bit of everything ... suckling pig, Portuguese fresh cheese, calamari, Flaming sausage, tomatoes and cucumbers, shrimp, rice, sardines, BBQed chicken and potatoes, steak and egg and Heavenly Creame.

They have a really awesome patio!

It was a fun night and great to try so many Portuguese dishes!"}
{"text":"I had the BBQ chicken - the chicken was moist and very flavourful. The potatoes had a very nice flavour too. The rice was a little bland/dry, but overall the experience was amazing! That side hot sauce is incredible too! Definitely a great place - will be back!"}
{"text":"The meat is mighty here!

Small establishment in Little Portugal loaded with Portuguese charm and flavors. It's a grill place, so the smell of skewering/grilling meat inside can be a bit on the nose. The delicious smells made me hungry as soon as I walked in with some friends late  afternoon on Super Bowl Sunday. It was pretty packed!

We ordered the flaming sausage, grilled squid, jumbo shrimp, salad and a pitcher of sangria. They were out of their pork and mussel dish when we visited, which was a bummer for me. I am porky and love to eat pork! The flaming sausage was a nice spectacle and delicious taste, although it could have been cured/cooked a bit less. The shrimp were deliciously grilled, I enjoyed them head, tails, skin et al. My friends enjoyed their grilled squid as well, though it could be a bit more flavorful. I absolutely enjoyed the sangria, but my friends thought it was a bit too sweet. The sangria was a nice accompaniment to the heavy meats we were eating and was very evocative of July1st/4th parties! I am hungry all over again just writing this review. 

The service is pretty good, they were patient as we dilly dallied over the menu, and were helpful in guiding us. They were usually attentive in filling our water, and quick to process our bill which was a bit hefty. Memory eludes me how much.

The restaurant has a very cosy, familial feel; the interiors smell like meat and smoke ( two of my favorite flavors) and the cutlery is ordinary. However, you can see the joy in people's faces as they tuck into their food!

The food and ambiance deserve a 3.5."}
{"text":"I was a long term (8+ years) customer of Bairrada and have introduced many, many friends to it. Unfortunately after what they pulled on me a week ago, I will NEVER go back. I purposely waited a week to write this review because I didn't want to write in anger, but it's been a week and I'm still spitting mad.

The Euro Cup final was held last weekend on July 10, 2016. Knowing it was likely that Portugal would be in the final and wanting to secure a table for me and a group of friends, I called Bairrada THREE WEEKS PRIOR to book a table for 6. I booked a table for 3pm, the start of the game, I was told that would be fine. All good. 

A week or so later, i called back to ask if I could change my booking to 8 people. Again, I mentioned that the booking was at 3pm. I was told the manager would call me back about the extra 2 people. He never did. Strike one.

Fast forward to the day of the game. At ten to three, I was stuck in traffic, so I called the restaurant, anxious to let them know we were on the way. No one picked up the phone. I called again. No one picked up the phone. Strike two.

At five minutes past three, the first person of our group arrived--and was told they had given away the table. So, me, my kid, and my five friends - including one who had come with her baby, from across the other side of town - were left with nowhere to watch the game that we had been planning on watching for over three weeks, because at FIVE MINUTES past three, they gave our table to some people that just happened to wander by. 

I want to be clear: I booked this table three weeks in advance, and spoke to the restaurant about it twice. Each time, I reiterated that the booking was for 3pm. AT NO POINT DID ANYONE SAY: \"If you are not here at 3pm on the dot, we will give your table away.\" 

This in itself was bad enough, but what made it a million times worse was the way the manager handled it. Instead of apologizing and offering us something to compensate - a free round of drinks next time we visit, for example - he shrugged and said \"Well you should have been here at 2.30.\" When I told him I made the booking for 3pm, and repeatedly checked that time with staff, and NOT A SINGLE PERSON had ever said that a 3pm booking actually meant a 2.30pm booking--also, that I had tried calling repeatedly just before 3pm and no one answered the phone--he shrugged again and stared at me. Then, realizing he had nothing to offer and didn't seem to care, I walked out, never to return to what had previously been one of my favourite restaurants.

I am still frankly astounded at how badly the manager handled the whole situation. I can't quite believe that after screwing up so monumentally (and it wasn't just us - several other tablefuls of people had the same thing happen to them) that he offered absolutely no way to rectify it. Nothing. Just \"deal with it.\" This guy clearly knows zero about hospitality or management. You may think you can treat people like shit because your restaurant is full at that particular moment, but bad impressions like the one I got that day stay with people for a long time, and have a way of spreading. As I said, I will never be returning, and I will be sharing my experience widely."}
{"text":"order through doordash and it was an awful experience. salad came with FAKE bacon (which was not advertised) that I cannot eat. the entire salad was covered, it should say simulated bacon on the doordash site. calamari was rubbery and hard to chew. very obviously frozen. the vegetables were cut sloppily and were MASSIVE, literally one piece of veggies were half of an entire brocolli. not cut into normal bite sized chunks. they also forgot an entire dish in my order. NOT IMPRESSED. the best thing was the cheese and that wasn't even cooked."}
{"text":"horrible horrible horrible!!!!  the service is nonexistent..   my in law ordered a soup..never got it.. so had to get it taken off the bill..   my in laws got their food 30mins before we got ours..  we sat there and waited and waited.. while they finished their dinner..  was told shrimp took longer to make...   it's not rocket science to know that shrimp doesn't take 45 mins to make when there was only 2 full tables .. and to top it off, it doesn't come with rice or veggies.. the waiter could've told us that .. nope, he didn't care..  why would he? he only came by to drop off my inlaw's food.. never came back to refill water, or ask if i wanted something else to drink..  we were there 2 hours.. this waiter came by once to drop off food.. i had to ask the other waiter where is our food.... he was nice enough to go check..   oh ya, i had ordered the grilled squid app... it super fishy.. sure sign that it wasn't fresh..  and the shrimp in the portugese sauce.. it was tiny shrimp with the shell still on....  THANKS for telling me.. it was torture trying to eat....  and i tried someone's salted cod.. it was super bland.. we've had good portugese food in the hartford area... i have to say this place's portuguese food is worst we've had ."}
{"text":"This food was JAMTASTIC!

I love Portuguese food, but this place reminded me when I was back in Portugal sitting on the castle steps of Sao Jorge having some random chef serving authentic Piri Piri Grilled Pork Chops with jazmine rice and beans and mixed veggies, served with a glass of red wine.

And that's exactly what I had and it was just as good as being in Portugal.
I tried all of my friends dishes, and they all were good. Anything that has Piri Piri in it is a winner. Their seafood dishes are also great! They give you good size portions as well.

I hope you have good pronunciation skills, because the meals are in Portuguese. Try it, it'll be fun. But the wait staff are friendly and they will help you through it.

The pricing is fair for this kind of food, 10-22 dollars.

The food here is sooo good I wanted to cry.....Everytime I go to Toronto, I'm stopping here. And that is FORSHIGGITY!

5 Stars"}
{"text":"Had the Feijoada, deliciously hearty, red bean stew which reminded me of my moms cooking...a bottle of Sagres and it was perfect! Sat at the bar but the bar stools were a bit short so wasn't the most comfortable seating, nevertheless was a great meal and cappuccino was the perfect ending."}
{"text":"This place is very very busy, especially if you go there in the summer. They have a fabulous patio that is just perfect to get hang out with friends over some Portuguese wine, some chicken or sardines. Portion sizes are very generous here, and the food is well cooked and comforting. Wednesdays, they give you complimentary roasted pork from a giant pig roast set up on one side of the patio :) 

Btw their creme caramel is REALLY delicious,so I recommend you finish off your meal with this awesome dessert :)"}
{"text":"Huge portions, delicious complimentary bread bowl, delicious meat, cheap booze, what else could you ask for? Driven by here several times in my neighborhood, buy just now got around to trying it. It was a pleasant surprise and far exceeded our expectations! The atmosphere is clean and simple with several large flat screen tvs, great for watching sports! Service was quick, friendly and professional. The prime rib was HUGE and for $14 could have fed three people! Chicken breast was perfect and also a generous serving. We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there with the family and another family with kids. Was pleasantly surprised to see that the place had been renovated since the last time I was here about 8 years ago. Simple but a nice bar and patio. Based on recommendations made by a Portuguese friend, we had the flaming chorizo, fresh cheese,steak and eggs, and a small roast chicken dinner with fries. 

Service was good. The gentlemen was friendly and timing was about right. Food was good and would equate to a mid-priced meal in the Mediterranean. Meaning, felt authentic. Their rice is delicious and really enjoyed the flaming sausage and fresh cheese with the bread.

Wish the steak and eggs came with gravy. Wasn't offered any but would ask next time we go."}
{"text":"So awesome this place is. Cheap, cheerful, plentiful, and oh-so-delicious! I love me some churrasco chicken and this place hits the spot everytime and keeps me wanting more. I'm such a sucker for salty goodness and it never leaves me disappointed. It really is an institution that is a must try. Nothing fancy, but still a great date spot on a Saturday night, you're guaranteed to see a packed house, and interesting patrons. Great service and super quick. Just writing this review is giving me a serious hankering.. :) 

If you're craving a salad with that delicious meat-filled meal of yours, I reco the garden salad or the tomato & cucumber salad (I would stay away from the caesar salad - it's literally bathing in ready-made dressing with about a bucket of simulated bacon bits on top. Didn't look too appetizing at the table next to us, and I don't think the couple thought so either... they seemed to be checking out our fresher looking salad on our table..) We usually spring for the whole bbq chicken, served with rice and potatoes. So salty and good, the piri piri sauce is delicious on everything and I can't help but slather it on all - rice and potatoes included. If you're feeling especially hungry this is a good one to share, alongside the Bitoque (steak & egg). The chickens are quite small, so the two together, with a salad are still cheap and cheerful and will fill you up comfortably. Definitely a dinner that won't break the bank and guarantees to be good times, no matter what."}
{"text":"We had a last minute business lunch scramble and we needed food fast for at least 25 people.  What's the universal beloved food that it's to grab and go (no... beer is not food)... chicken!  I was intending to head over to Swiss Chalet (ack) since it was conveniently close to us, it's well known and liked by my work.  Someone suggested we try their absolute favourite place, Bairrada Churrasqueira Grill instead for the chicken.  I always love finding gems in the neighbourhood so with a quick call, we ordered 8 full sized chickens for us.

The restaurant is in a strip plaza (like 99% local Mississauga restaurants) and it's quite old looking from the outside.  Inside is filled with wood paneling and it's quite old school.  The scent of oil and grilled meats filled the air.  It smells great and I was thinking the recommendation was a great choice.  Ordering was pretty darn easy over the phone and when it came to pick up, the meat was ready to go.  Sadly... the staff wasn't.  We first walked in and no one greeted us.  It was completely empty.  We tried to find someone for a few minutes.  Finally someone walked out and asked us if we wanted to be seated.  We said we wanted to pick up our order and they went to the kitchen to get it.  I didn't time it but I swear we waited at least another 5 minutes.  A different person came out of the kitchen and asked what we wanted.  We told them that we were here for our pick up and that someone else went to get it.  They said that the meat was already done and they'll get it.  They went back to the kitchen to get it... feels like deja vu right?  At this point, we were probably standing in the restaurant for at least 10 minutes for an order that was already done.  

FINALLY the chicken was brought out in a large aluminum platter and a large carton of sauce was given to us.  They must have overfilled it cause there was tons of red oil just leaking everywhere onto the platter from the styrofoam carton.  We wanted to head back quickly as people were waiting for food but I think the person must have had a memory lapse because it took them nearly 3 tries to get them to work the credit card machine.  

Within a good 15 minutes, we were back at the office and opening up the platter.  The chicken smell was that great rotisserie smell with a hint of citrus.  How did it taste?  It was more flavourful than Swiss Chalet with the citrus marinade or baste they had on it.  The skin was crispy with a paprika spice on it.  ... so why the 2 star review?  Chicken was kinda cold, it was really dry, and some of the chicken looked malnourished (maybe it was from being too dry?).  It was definitely on the small size.  The sauce they provided did end up going everywhere and it was 35% oil.  It was untouched as most people didn't want to douse their chicken with it.

It's a toss up ... good taste but overcooked and cold with the most confusing service I've had this month.  I wish I could say I would order from them again but sadly I can't."}
{"text":"I went to Bairrada Churrasqueira to try some Portuguese food during my trip to Toronto.  I'm pretty sure the only Portuguese food I've tried at that point was the bastardised version in Macao or Macanese restaurants where the dishes are made for Chinese taste buds, so I was curious what real Portuguese food is like.  My sister and I were staying with my aunt in the suburbs but we didn't have anything planned that day anyway so my sister and I, and my cousins and aunt all made the trek to the city just to try this restaurant.

All in all it was worth the trip just because none of us have had Portuguese food before.  But in my opinion the food, or at least what I ordered, wasn't particularly memorable.  I ordered the Frango no Churrasco, which is a roasted chicken dish.  The chicken was served with long grain rice, sauteed potato balls, and olives.  Olive is one of the few things I generally don't like to eat, so I skipped that.  Everything was pretty average and nothing distinctive.  The food wasn't bad, but it also doesn't taste any different from many other roasted chicken dishes I've had.  I probably should have ordered seafood instead, knowing that Portugal is bordered by so much water.  But the menu stated that the Frango no Churrasco is the restaurant's specialty so it caught my eye."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is kind of ridiculously good. The shock? Purely because it's located about a 2 minute walk from my home, and I have now only been there twice.

I had heard before that it was a well-loved spot; a friend from the suburbs had even spoken of coming into this area specifically to eat here. I have certain places where I usually satisfy my Portuguese-style chicken needs, and though I do, as a rule, prefer the rotisserie to the grill where chicken is concerned, I fear that I sold these guys short for a long time. I remember having it once, a couple years back and thinking it was a bit too dry (drier than rotisserie, which it is, which is normal), and that their potatoes were a bit too greasy. 

I would like to take this opportunity to retract my previous, incorrect perception. The chicken is deliciously seasoned and barbecued, and juicy. The rice is mildly and delightfully seasoned and the Parisienne-style potatoes are OMG delicious. Juicy and yes, kinda oily but in a nothing-but-mouth-watering way. They also have a very large dining room, a pretty big following (from what I gather), and a larger and more varied menu than I realized. Thank you blizzard, and for canceled plans that were responsible for taking me, and stranding me (starving) in a westward direction (9 out of 10 times, I go eastward)."}
{"text":"Maybe is me??I was really disappointed with the food I ordered at Bairrada Churrasqueira Grill.

The bread was so cold, dry and rock solid hard!! I love bread.. I love carbs... but I really cannot eat those...

BBQ Chicken was dried, flavourless..not even the tasty hot sauce can't bring life back to it.. I have better Portuguese chicken at some small takeout places!!

Flaming Sausage though is cute, and make an excellent photo opps but just OK... 

We were ignored and never given the menu till I asked the waitress for one... after that the services did pick up. 

I am glad that other have better experience, but I don't think I will be back here to eat again!"}
{"text":"I have been on several occasions, hoping that the food quality will get better. I'm not picky in regards to food presentation; I understand that great food can look horrible.

Pros
- decent prices for the size of meal that you get (hearty portions); as mentioned by Richie S., most dishes are basic meat and potatoes and rice, not much to look at, but decent.
- the rice was very good

Cons
- BBQ chicken (signature dish) was very dry (on all occasions that I've been)
- potatoes surprisingly were not delicious; too greasy, too soft/boiled. Not sure what it was
- environment/ambiance: if the food was better tasting, environment/ambiance would not be an issue. But I put this in the con section because it's very cafeteria kitchen-esque; there is an outdoor seating area which could be nice.

Overall
Disappointed. From the other reviews, I had expected delicious piri-piri/BBQ chicken. However, the quality of the food was sub-par. Environment/ambiance/service - nothing spectacular to rave about.

Wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"After Kent P refused to shut up about the patio at Bairrada, I had to check it out. Everything you've heard is true: it rules. The patio is enormous, covered with picnic tables and well-shaded by towering trees. There is a large spit for roasting animals and a big screen TV out there (\"to catch the game\" as they say). You'll feel like you're visiting your rich Portuguese cousins with the kickass backyard. It's relaxing and homey and buzzing with life.

We were there to get drunk and eat meat, so we ordered a mess load. Flaming sausage (obvs), BBQ chicken, pork cutlets, grilled salmon and a tonne of sides. We were thinking of the suckling pig, but our waiter shook his head \"no\". Apparently, it's better to order earlier in the day. The foodstuffs came our relatively quickly, but there were plenty of pints to keep us occupied. I vaguely recall that pitchers were very competitively priced. (At least competitively enough that I can't remember how much they were.)

I enjoyed our food, and there was a LOT of it. Admittedly the best part of the sausage were the flames (I thought I was going to lose my eyebrows) as the meat was a little dry. The fish and BBQ chicken however were really tasty. And the portions you get for these prices are quite substantial.

Service was a bit frazzled during the jam-packed long weekend night, but overall super friendly. We accidentally got some of the horrible boiled potatoes you have heard about (we ordered fries instead) but they corrected this mistake quickly without a fuss.

The patio atmosphere will definitely contribute to the enjoyment of your meal (lousy wasps excluded); admittedly, I'd be less likely to return if I had to sit inside. But on a hot summer evening in Toronto, Bairrada is must-visit location.

Obligatory Title Pun: I can't even pronounce CHURRASQUEIRA.

Menu Readability: I appreciate the detailed descriptions.

Need to mention: I think it came to about $40 per person, and we left full of beer and food. Beat that.

What this place teaches me about myself: The flaming sausage is not nearly as impressive on the way up. FACT."}
{"text":"We had dinner in there , we ordered the chicken BBQ . The food coming, chicken is dry and bland. The food is no taste so you have to put their spice so you can taste the salt on food.
After finish with the food , we ask for the bill. We pay with cash and the waiter ask \" you want the change?\"
Why he ask that ? Of course we want the change money ....since when tips become must to give to waiter ? Since when we have to pay the salary of the restaurant worker? we already pay for the food and we have to pay the worker too ?"}
{"text":"Came here for my brothers bday dinner. The place was very spacious with a patio if you wanted to sit there. It's situated really close to cooksville go station so I can see them getting a dinner rush if people are hungry for food after work. They give quite large portions for the price! We had the steaks, mussels and fish. Fish was too dry in my opinion so I would skip that next time. The mussels were fantastic in a tomato sauce, and I even brought the rest home and used it in pasta! The steaks were done to the desired doneness by everyone and was very flavourful. We didn't get a chance to try the flaming sausage, but it looked cool at the table next to us"}
{"text":"A friend of mine went to this resturant but at a different location. The pictures that I had viewed looked appetizing so I thought it worth the travel from where I lived (about a 20 minute drive) to head up here. 

We entered the resturant and seated ourselves.The waiter, who spoke Portuguese, greeted us and offered complementary bread and butter. I ordered sparking water and grilled calamari to start and shortly afterwards ordered our mains. Our mains were BBQ chicken and Chicken Kabob with salad, rice and potatoes. The mains took a bit of time to arrive but when it did, I was pleased with the portion size and quality of the food.

I found the rice and potatoes to be a tad bit on the salty side but I am generally have a sensitive taste to salt. Overall good place and if you're feeling portugese food, check it out."}
{"text":"A good buddy recommended checking out this place, and hot damn I owe him a drink. What a find!

This is among the best Portuguese BBQ chicken I have ever had, and I've never said no to greasy poultry. This isn't really greasy in the gross KFC way, but in the mouth-watering juicy way. For $10 you get a whole bird and they cut it up for you and sauce it up. For sides we got the salad, which was meh, and the fries which are obviously frozen... but who cares?! THE CHICKEN! 

When you first enter this place, you think it's just a small diner-like spot, but keep walking through to their massive (and I mean MASSIVE) back patio. A scenic outdoor space with fountains, a pig spit and a huge tree providing lots of shade. What a gorgeous patio. I'm talking wedding-worthy. So nice. 

Check this place out, Yelpers!

GOTTA KNOW: What is that red tomato hot sauce that they serve at Portuguese restaurants? I keep forgetting to ask. Need to find a grocer that sells it."}
{"text":"It seems I posted a review for this place but for a different restaurant by accident in 2015 because of a location error on my phone at the time. Here was my review for this place.

Wish I could give it a higher rating.

I got the 1/2 chicken dinner to go.

The chicken (really good), the rice and potatoes all tasted good. Large portion and price included taxes....

However

The Peri sauce to me with just oil. I've never had a sauce with so much oil. I didn't use it which can be a bonus seeing I felt the food didn't need it. Of course without the sauce it wasn't spicy but was good nonetheless.

The lady who took my order for takeout: Her hands were wet when she took my order and I watched her use a spoon to fill my container, fair enough. When she asked if I wanted bread I said yes. She opened a door and took the bread out with her bare hands. She then proceeded to use the interact machine right after. It didn't sit well with me and I didn't eat the bread (which she placed in the bag ontop of the container with my food,not even wrapped in paper towels at least).

The place deserves a higher rating but I can't with these two things I found wrong."}
{"text":"La Bairrada is one of my \"default\" places in Toronto, so I am obviously biased with this review, sorry!

There are few important things to keep in mind while evaluating this place:

1. You'd better know the difference between a bife and a steak (which is a huge topic in itself)

2. You'd better be accustomed with Latin lifestyle (and that's not about being \"social\" and able to produce a perfectly fake smile)

Or you can be just an open and positive person, able to communicate with a people of different cultural background and interested in trying something not-so-common around the Downtown.

If you are, you will love La Bairrada, and possibly become friends with anyone from waiters to the kitchen people, and maybe even with the owner of the place himself.

If you are not, sorry - but most probably you'd leave this place rather disappointed and without much desire to return. It's that simple."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner, they have a great patio and the people are amzing.The place is decent and the server was friendly. I ordered the frango a churrasco the portion was great but the BBQ chicken was extremely dry and had no flavour, if I didn't have the piri-piri sauce it would of been horrible. The caldo Verde was actually good, service was also not that great,  ower server never came back to check on us,  this place really needs major improvements food and service wise...  It really isn't worth trying this place out,  there are better Portuguese restaurant out there. Final seguestion don't come here if your expecting great food and service."}
{"text":"It was really a culinary disaster. We order a chorizo which was the only thing good. Then we order calamari, bitoque, and veal chops. The bitoque and the veal chops were not good, the rice very dry seems to be cooked a few days before, the yolk on the bitoque was too cooked. Fries and potatoes had no taste. We didn't enjoy our meal at all. I won't be back."}
