{"text":"Small and cramped location. We waited 10 minutes for a table when there were 3 empty. The menu was limited and execution was disappointing. They seemed to be trying so hard to be cool and trendy that they forget to make good food. I won't be be back. Veggie burger was depressing, fries cold, beer warm, and onion rings covered in a wildly large amount of oil."}
{"text":"Best burgers and fries. Always extremely friendly and helpful staff. They are usually busy but it always seems to go quickly. They do a great job."}
{"text":"Food was really good but the service was shaky - waitress had an attitude and other employees were aloof. Liked the atmosphere. Beer was overpriced. $8 for a draft is a bit offensive."}
{"text":"Had a delicious lamb burger with a kicked-up sauce (spicy*** not for the faint of heart); lamb lovers will enjoy this.  Great onion rings: light batter and tasty dipping sauce.  Better than average draft selections with better than average prices, too.  Not for kids.  Lively and a bit loud even at lunch.  Server (Ryan P) was knowledgeable, friendly, accommodating: we were able to sample two pumpkin ales before making our decision.  A little pricey, but this is Hudson, First $ Main."}
{"text":"Their burgers are good.. If your standard is Applebee's or tgif but there's no contest going up against similarly priced local spots like Deagan's, Forage or Lolita. Also, what kind of burger restaurant does not cook their burgers to order?"}
{"text":"Was there today for lunch right after they had open.  14 to 18 people seated before us. One table was a six top. After placing our order it took 35 to 40 minutes to get our burgers. Guess the rest of the customers beat us to the orders. The burgers are out of this world. Service good nothing to brag about. Cleanliness- need to check table condiments because mustard bottle had BBQ sauce all over it. Disgusting. Would not consider going back again due to the wait for our lunch.  Should expand though into the one red door restaurant next door since that place was dead. Insure staffing meets the needs of the guest. It's just burgers and anything over 15 minutes not acceptable. Giving a 3 because of the food being outstanding."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Sat in the open window section. By the time we left a 6:30 or so the place was packed."}
{"text":"It's a significantly nicer place with a better quality menu than I anticipated, but also with that comes higher prices. Guess I should expect that in a plaza with a bridal shop. Expect to pay $10 minimum for a burger, plus like another $4.50 if you want fries too. The server assured me the fry servings were very large but solo I'd rather just have a small side for under $2.

I got the titular burger and it was excellent and plenty to eat. But due to the cost I won't be back for lunch unless the boss is buying. But I hope that happens because the rest of the menu including milkshakes looked very good."}
{"text":"I love the Hudson location and was so excited to see them open one in River, right by where I live!! Went with my boyfriend this past Saturday, sat at the bar, and had great service. Our bartender was a guy (I forget his name) who was very attentive and friendly. We loved our burgers! An additional plus- they have good red wine. I didn't have to settle for garbage!!"}
{"text":"Menu is limited, but large enough that anyone should be able to find something they like.  Keeping the menu small means they can focus on their core items - burgers and sides (truffle fries and onion rings are great).  Great selection of beer, including seasonal specials.  Servers are knowledgeable and friendly.  Dine-in can be complicated as seating is limited and people waiting may stare you down.  Take out is an option, but if you have to go more than a few minutes, Flip Side's food is best eaten on location as it doesn't travel all that well."}
{"text":"Got the house burger.it reminded me of a school lunch burger.the bun was old the burger was not seasoned and the onion stuff( caramelized?) Was poopy.it came with a condiment which was unique.not in a tasty way.got the fries with cheese.it was edible .my friends got a mushroom gravy on their fries.it was mushroom juice.gross.also had onion rings and they were not seasoned.would not go back wendys is way better.not a joke"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've ever had! Their beef is amazing and cooked perfect! When you go order the house chips as an appetizer because they are fabulous. The truffle fries are awesome too."}
{"text":"Such good food! I wish the fries weren't a la carte but they are so worth it (truffle and cheese). Flip side never fails to disappoint! Burgers are all great, especially the tuna burger."}
{"text":"One word: amazing! Thank you for a killer burger. Server, food and atmosphere were all amazing. We had a lovely night and enjoyed the entire time. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years, and it's consistently great.  Wonderful selection of beers and ale, burgers can't be beat, onion rings marvelous, great toppings for everything.  Try the Forester Burger, the Flipside Burger, and really any other burger.  Great service, friendly.  Only criticism: I don't like bistro tables and chairs and don't see the reason for them.  They are uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I have been to FlipSide before and the food is excellent.  I just wanted to tell you about our experience the other when we were treated very badly.  Wednesday 2/29.  

We had patiently waited nearly 45 minutes for a table and when we were one of only two parties still waiting for a table and knew we were ahead of the other party standing near us, we questioned the hostess as to why we couldn't be seated at the empty table, she said that one other party was ahead of us.  Well where were they?  The 'other party' was nowhere to seen!  We waited another 5 minutes or so and by now the hostess was avoiding us, but still nobody from the other party showed up.  Any reasonable person would have allowed us to sit down and would have had the other party wait for the next table AFTER they'd arrived.

We wait several more minutes.  Still nobody was coming for the empty table.  Finally, at least ten minutes after the table became available; ONE PERSON showed up from the other party and was promptly seated.   The rest of her party who, judging from the shopping bags brought in by the girl who was seated, were apparently still shopping.  

We couldn't believe they would keep us waiting like that.  This place does not take reservations or 'call ahead' so there was no reason to hold the table for people who were not even there.  

The other party could easily have taken the next table once they showed up.  This is how any other restaurant would have handled it.  Or I could understand if the other party was a minute or two away, but there was no sign of them for several minutes! The hostess, who up to this point, had been standing with us near the front entrance, made herself very scarce to avoid our questioning.  We strongly suspect that the hostess knew the 'other party' as was purposely holding the table for her friends.  

When my husband talked to the manager about this, she had no apology.  Just said someone else was ahead of us - no explanation as to why they would not seat us and give the
absent party the next table.  We were very dissatisfied with the service."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place while I was in Akron and I'm glad I did. Staff was friendly and attentive. Restaurant was clean and had a great atmosphere. They had a good selection of craft beers which is always a plus in my book and had very good mixed drinks too. 
 The food in this place was above average I had Chili Pepper Burger medium which was amazing and I really liked the smoked chili ketchup that was made for this burger. I also had a order of triple cooked fries with mushroom gravy which where good and the perfect for sharing. I also sampled my buddies macaroni & cheese with the BBQ Brisket which was good just didn't have a lot of brisket in it.
Overall really liked this place and I have it bookmarked so next time I am in the area I would stop by again."}
{"text":"They are known for their burgers, however I don't know why. Don't get me wrong the burgers are average but nothing more. They are overpriced for what you get (including quality). Service is fairly good though."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you like your burgers well done. Still red inside after they were sent back once."}
{"text":"Location:  Good spot, in demand so if you arrive after six and before 8:30-9 expect at least an hour wait.
Food:  Good stuff, good variety, sides are good and old fashioned fries and gravy are tasty.
Bad:  Beer prices.  I find it outrageous to have two beers, craft brew IPAs, and have them cost $8 each.  So a burger costs $9-10 and the beers are $7-8? 
Go there for a burger but order water.  Then head up to Kepners to get the same beers for less than $5."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the prices are very reasonable. I have eaten a different burger each time and have never been disappointed. Having a special sauce to complement each burger is an interesting touch. 

The one drawback is that the restaurant is small and can seat very few. The wait is easily out the door, even if there are only a few parties in line. We avoid the restaurant during peak hours, as we will probably not be able to stand the wait."}
{"text":"Very good burgers.  Perfect size. Bun was light and tasty.  I had the Shawn Burger, very good. The egg and bacon was cooked perfectly. My wife had the Mikey Burger and she enjoyed it. Good beer selection.  Gets crowded quickly.  Bartender was very pleasant. We ate at the bar and our only complaint we had is where they collect the dirty dishes. Well in sight of those at the bar and  the loud clanging when tossing dishes in the bin"}
{"text":"The truffle fries were decent, until I tried them with the remoulade sauce that comes with the Mikey burger...fantastic! That sauce would make broccoli tasty! The burgers are exceptional, I had the flipside burger. 

They are on par with Grover's and Vizzi's from Buffalo, NY. It didn't wow me, but it is definitely one of the better burger joints I have found in NE Ohio."}
{"text":"The Kobe beef corn dogs were awesome and their milkshakes look tasty, but this place is extremely overpriced. $12 for a mediocre burger and at least $6 for most beers. There's nothing unique about this place that sets it apart from the many other burger joints in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Wedge salad was overpriced for the amount of food. Chili was lackluster. Onion rings tasted of old grease. Server was polite and attentive."}
{"text":"I was refused service at this burger place because  I was in a Wheelchair, they said the resturant was not designed to accomidate wheelchairs. Do the owners know that it is illigal and discrimittory. The americans with disibility act also makes it illeagal to refuse a person service who is in  wheelchair."}
{"text":"My wife was told about Flip Side so we decided to try it last night. The decor was decent. It kind of reminded me of an upscale college type bar. A little more lighting would have been nice. The server was nice and polite. I wish he had asked us how we wanted our burgers cooked.  My wife order the Forrester Burger and I had the Black and Blue Burger. We ordered the Onion Rings and had a vanilla shake and a chocolate shake. The shakes were very good. Nice to see regular ingredients in them instead of milk-stuff and syrup mix.  Our burgers and onion rings came to us shortly after. The burgers were cooked barely a share over rare. The Forrester burger that has the mushrooms on it was all crispy. The onion rings tasted like McCann's or some other brand's frozen onion rings fried in fish oil.  The remoulade was bland and tasted like mayonaise with chili powder in it. Yuck! Total turn-off! We had been to Michael Symon's B spot in Woodmere last week and experienced way better food."}
{"text":"Burgers are good but plan to wait a VERY long time unless you are lucky enough to get a seat at the bar.  I have NEVER gotten a smaller shake in My life! A $6.50 shake (non-alcoholic) came in a juice glass!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here,  food was wonderful. Big fan of local-source restaurants. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We looooove this place. There's few restaurants that we go to regularly or even go more than once. This is a favorite. The burgers are perfect. I love the green eggs and ham burger. Their sweet potato fries with horseradish aoli is inspired. Their truffle fries and their loaded home made potato chips are all fantastic. A+++"}
{"text":"Always so busy! I'm not a fan of waiting 2 hours for a burger. The food is ok don't get me wrong but you will wait for it if it's anywhere from 3 pm- close. They have tasty boozy milkshakes and a variety of food options but really the food is pretty average to maybe slightly above average for some things."}
{"text":"Very good! Service, atmosphere and food are all on point! I highly recommend this place. We were driving and luckily for us it was pouring so we stopped! Hand squeezed juice. Grass Fed Beef and yummy eggs! Delish and recommended!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying i hate katsup!! BUT, i absolutely loved theirs!! I got a burger w a chili katsup, pickled jalapinos, jack cheese..fabulous burger place. And drink menu looked awesome w great selections. Service is friendly and attentive. Nice atmosphere. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Angie and I love great burgers. We chase them. Today we found one among the very few we would call the best we've ever had. Try FlipSide if you chase good burgers, too. Angie had the Green Eggs and Ham burger. I had the Shawn burger. Both were exceptional and cooked to order exactly as we asked. The only thing better than a great burger is great fries. These were. And the only thing better than both of those things is great service--our server Rachelle, was the best. Thanks, Rachelle, for your food recommendations, great service and warm smile."}
{"text":"It was ok I had the blueberry alcoholic shake and it was pretty good. The mushroom burger was good and my fiance liked what he got. The service was not so good though. I might consider going back with better service"}
{"text":"Quality food and great waitstaff. Great beer selection.

The place is very small so expect to wait or go at an off time. 

Great addition to First & Main."}
{"text":"I will go a long way for a good burger especially a grass fed burger and the Flipside fits the bill.

 Went there with friends and my wife we all decided to get a different item on the menu to try out a number of offerings.
 
 We decided to try out the Flipside,the black and blue and the lamb burgers along with the sweet potato fries and the regular -Loved them both.

 The burgers were all excellent. Only complaint was the quality of the blue cheese itself. Had this non creamy,weird texture about it( I'm very selective with my cheese). But otherwise all is well in Burgerland.

    We had a couple of the beers on tap which the waitress helped us select and she was right on the money.

  The cocktails were very well made and hit the spot.

 The staff and our waitress were spot on and very knowledgeable of the food and  the spirits.

      Definitely a go to place.


                      ps  May have to wait a little bit before seating but not as bad as the Melt."}
{"text":"Love this place when I'm craving a real burger.  100% the best burger you'll ever eat. Grass fed Ohio beef."}
{"text":"So good! Had the Mikey burger, sweet potato fries and fries with gravy.  The burger was amazing.  Fries were good,  but I think I'd try the onion rings next time- they looked amazing."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place when I saw the menu but it was nothing special at all!
I got the inverted burger and I thought it was a joke when they set the plate in front of me because it was the size of a mini slider. How in the hell can they charge 10 dollars for this when it doesn't even come with a side?!
Then my husband order a burger med rare and this burger was rare all right I'm talking meat not even COOKED! They are just a bit to pricey for the food and service you get here! Don't see myself returning."}
{"text":"Hop Slam and truffle fries... That is all that needs to said.  Love the sweet potato fries too."}
{"text":"Had the worst 8 dollar Bloody here. Looked like everyone around me got great service sadly I'm not a rich Hudson snob so I got poor service."}
{"text":"Food is good for what it is. The problem is the staff (or maybe management). You're often greeted by an empty hostess stand. Then, the wait staff are nice people, but just not good at their jobs. One night our waiter was aloof and had yet to learn please/thank you/you're welcome. You'd ask for something, he'd stare at you blankly, nod, and walk away. Tonight, the kitchen was out of an ingredient (pickled jalapeño). Instead of notifying my wife, they just dumped on raw jalapeño instead. Of course she noticed and asked the nice waiter what's up. 10 minutes later, with my wife's burger now cold, his answer was \"sorry we're out\". Again, nice guy in that \"too many football concussions\" kinda way. We also had to ask the nice football player a couple times for water and he miffed up our check. 

The flip side to Flipside is that the interior is quite nice and very comfortable."}
{"text":"good burger !! I like B spot better but my girls like Flip Side better."}
{"text":"So I \"cheated\" on the Bspot at this Hudson burger joint. It can only be described as hooking up with a super model when you have a really hot wife. That's what I imagine since I have neither. You know what I do have? Tight pants after eating here. I stuffed myself with the blue cheese burger and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were so good I would slap your mother if she tried to take one off my plate. Unless your mother is bigger than me....

The burgers were grass fed beef (soooo good) and everything was piping hot and fresh. My buddy's burger looked off the hook too. 

The service was great from start to finish. I'm going back to this place soon..."}
{"text":"Haven't taken a bite of my food and already know I won't be back. If you're incapable of accommodating to-go orders don't offer them. Was told 25-30 minutes. Got there at 30 minutes then stood there for another 25 minutes because \"a big order came in.\" Burgers take 5 minutes to cook, and there's no way these will be good enough for me to come back after this first experience.

Might as well update after eating: fries were ice cold, as though they put them in a box when we ordered then forgot they made us wait an hour. Burger was tasteless and my toppings I ordered were missing. I threw half of it away. Seriously, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger place; larger burgers than B Spot, but the both burgers are great in my opinion. The set ups are similar, both sell the burgers a la carte and require you to buy fries or onion rings separately. I find the B Spot specialty burgers are better, but FlipSide gets some of the more basic and simple combos better.

The beer selection is great and there are about 3 or 4 TVs around to watch sports on."}
{"text":"The food was great but the wait for us was super long. We had our names on the wait list first and we were with 7 people. The hostesses weren't very nice and kept saying we were going to be at different tables and then moved us. Finally we got 1 table and then they were going to give us another one and then sat some other people there. Finally we got a table and had really good food with a nice waiter."}
{"text":"Had a very good hamburger (Shawn Burger) and fries last week. Asked the waiter for a good beer pairing and was pleased with outcome. Will return again.  Cool decor inside.  High top tables only, so can be tricky to bring small children."}
{"text":"Chose this place based exclusively on their beer selection, while looking for a place to eat at First & Main.
 
 The decor is abysmal; it looks like an Applebees that hasn't nailed all of the crap to the walls yet. The chairs are awkwardly high, it's small, and feels kind of like a movie set (incomplete).

 That said, the food delivers. It's a touch expensive, but of good quality and originality. My dinner partner got the (only) vegetarian offering, and raved throughout the meal. My burger exceeded my expectations; it was far more delicious than the description would have led me to believe. The number of beers available is staggering, and it took longer to chose a beer than it did our food.  The service wasn't great, but very friendly, and the staff contributed to a \"loose\" atmosphere.  

 The \"not the food\" stuff about this place isn't great. But the food is, and it's absolutely worth visiting."}
{"text":"Best burgers around. We used to go to B spot all the time, but haven't been back since we discovered Flipside."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Give either the flip side or smokey burger a try. I think you'll agree they are great. Also, try the onion rings or sweet potato fries, you won't be disappointed. The only negative is this is a small restaurant, so don't expect to be seated right away on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Stopped by based on the overly enthusiastic yelp reviews.

Must say I was disappointed.  

Burger was just okay.  Tasted no better than my favorite diner's burger does back in NYC.

Service and uncomfortable seating, however, sink this place for me.  

Service: This place is small and there were only two other parties there.  It took 20 minutes for the server to take my order.  And it's good she came by then, because I was already debating exactly how I should walk out. (With a flourish?  Just slink out the door?? Leave a tip for the water???) The waitress was attentive after taking my order, but still, I don't want to be in the position of debating whether or not to walk out of a restaurant.

Seating:
All the tables are high tops.  (Think bar height, without the bar.) The chairs had very little cushion, which usually wouldn't have been an issue, but for the fact that I could not brace myself against the ground - because the chairs are also tall.  Admittedly, I probably wouldn't have noticed the chairs if I hadn't been sitting there, idle for so long.

Also of note: I was there during the day light hours, and it looked like the place was closed from the outside.  It was only when I got really close and peered in the window that I could tell that there were people in there."}
{"text":"Have been here three or four times now. Food is over-priced. Grouper sandwich is ok. Pizzas are terrible. Service is slow and inattentive. Acoustics are really awful. Wish I could recommend, but cannot."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in on a Monday afternoon for an early dinner. Small pub tucked in on Hudson Square. Not much to say about the decor. Can imagine it would be fairly loud during a busy time. In summary, not worth it! Nothing special about the food, drinks or atmosphere. But if you want some details, see below.

Ordered the basic burger, the Flip Side burger, and an order of sweet potato fries. Both burgers came out with lettuce, tomato and pickles that looked like they had seen much better days. Both burgers were OK, but not worth the price ($7 & $9). That is for just the burgers. I guess this approach is more common considering B-Spot and other joints,  but these for sure were not worth it. The sweet potato fries were also just alright, but nothing special. Especially at $4.50 for a plate of fries.  

Was going to have few beverages but at $7/8 for a pint of something I can find anywhere else for almost half that , I had to pass. As I said, these are not exotic craft beers that are hard to find these days. 

Finally, the service was less than stellar. It is difficult to say, but it appeared that there was more than just the bartender there, though he was the only one we could tell doing anything. We waited 20 minutes for a check while several other employees seemed to be chatting it up at the back of the bar. Guy in a button down (manager possibly) walked through several times and paid no attention to us while the bartender was busy taking stock with his back to us. Just seems better attention to one of only two tables in the joint with customers could have taken place."}
{"text":"I'm sure it's bad for both my health and wallet to stop here on 2 consecutive days, but, I don't care it's worth it. First time I just got a cheeseburger, which was cooked right on. It appeared that the bottom bun was completely soaked and soggy in burger juice, but I was pleased that the bun held up, even after rebuilding the burger. Not sure if the pickle chips are homemade, but damn they were tasty. Fries were cooked perfectly. Second time around I had to try the Brisket Mac and Cheese, and another burger. Loved the Mac and cheese with the great combination of the brisket. Each time I have gotten burgers they have been spot on with the seasoning. Whoever I take with me to Flip Side loves how good the burgers are. I also like how the portions are big, and that the burgers aren't drowning in copious amounts of fatty grease like the shitty Rail burgers. I can actually eat good burgers and fries and not feel like garbage after. 

The only downside is, it's just too damn loud with half the restaurant full. Like way to loud in that I pretty much have to yell to the person 1.5 feet away from me, which I really don't like doing. Our server the first night was great and helpful being our first time, and she was spot on with anything we needed. The next day we came just before 6 to only a quarter full. While the dude was nice at first, his attentiveness could have been more frequent. Towards the end he just seem disinterested. 

Really a great place with fantastic food. Feel I need to go outside my comfort zone and try some of the more elaborate burgers featured on the menu. The mushroom gravy fries are next!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times. The burgers are my favorite and their milkshakes are killer.  Throw in a great beer list and what else do you need."}
{"text":"This was our second time at The Flipside. Both times the best burger we have ever had and the best cooked. Our kids even thought it was the best burger. The onion rings were perfectly cooked also. The bartender and our server we excellent too. thanks again."}
{"text":"Flip side is amazing. Beautiful modern atmosphere and family friendly. Good service, and everything we ordered was amazing. We got the wedge salad and they put all of the toppings on the side for you which was perfect. Mushroom gravy fries were so good, the fries alone are amazing. And then we also got the Mikey Burger-- good standard burger with bacon and cheese and an onion ring and then also there was a remoulade that was a little spicy and the perfect compliment. (We also dipped our fries in the remoulade.)"}
{"text":"To me this place is better than BSpot as the portions are larger for the same prices. A nice selection of burgers and they are well seasoned. An order of sweet potato fries was large enough for me and the significant other to share. For two burgers, one side of fries, two beers and an iced tea the total was about $45. Without alcohol it would have been around $30. 
It is very loud and hard to hear the server or the person across from you. I went on a Friday night around 8 and there was a 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, well portioned too. A bit pricey, the burgers don't come with a side. Small area, so our wait on a Saturday night was 45 minutes, but that was during the OSU game."}
{"text":"Did not like. I ordered the same exact thing as another yelper, forester and truffle fries and both were meh...agree on the burger: small super greasy way undercooked and mushrooms reheated..also my fries were soggy and not crispy at all :(  $18 disappointment!!!"}
{"text":"Always good food here! A really cool relaxed atmosphere with friendly service.  If you go for lunch, make sure you arrive before 12:00pm - otherwise you might not get a table.  Their Kobe beef corn dogs and onion rings are delicious!"}
{"text":"Phenomenally delicious!
    The meat seasoning and tenderness was over the top. Mom and I sat at the bar (creatively made from pressed concrete). We had the simplicity burger and root beers. Try the bacon martini! The atmosphere was swanky rustic with unique flair to design and detail with warm wood tones. The service was hospitable and quick! Glad we came... We will return!"}
{"text":"The way a burger should be. Fresh, not over cooked and just the right size. i think it's strange nobody mentioned the milkshakes. They are AWESOME! Best part is they'll add booze to it if you want. It's a small place so there is a wait at the typical meal time but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We both had the Flip Side burger and it was delicious. I didn't like the smell if the metal tables. The service was friendly but not attentive."}
{"text":"My dad imparted upon me what was honestly probably the best culinary advice that I've ever been given. Granted, I was probably 10 years old and easy to impress, but it sticks with me, nonetheless.

Dad: When you're at a new restaurant, always order a hamburger. If a place can cook a really great burger, they can cook anything.

Me: Wow, Dad. You're the best.

Okay, so I put a bit of a \"Leave it to Beaver\" spin on this, but for the most part. It's true. (Although as a surly 10 year old, I probably said something clever like, \"Eh, whatever.\")

While traveling to visit friends in the Cuyahoga Falls area, we decided to go see if all the \"Oh, you have to visit Hudson!\" talk was warranted. (Sidenote, it was! We loved Hudson at large.)

So after shopping in some fairly cutesy stores with some really great personalities, we were getting hungry. A local shopowner suggested trying Flip Side, and said that at 11:20, it was probably early enough for us to get in and not wait.

Thank you, shopkeep. We got the last table with no waiting.

The decor was nondescript. It wasn't terrible by any stretch, but there's nothing exciting going on in here when it comes to decor. 

Not that it needed to be. 

See, I have this theory. While ambience absolutely *does* matter to me in a dining experience, some pretty beautiful restaurants I've visited have had pretty abysmal food. Alternatively, like Flip Side, the stars of this restaurant were the servers and the food.

I'll just say it - the Flip Side burger with its cheese, bacon, and balsamic onions - was the best burger that I have ever had. Ever. Seriously.

The burger was just cooked to perfection - it was slightly pink inside, but not so pink it made me wonder about picking up food cooties. Those balsamic onions were unique, different, and not overcooked - they weren't clear, and they weren't too crispy. They were just perfect. The bacon was thick, the cheese was too, and overall it was really good.

The sweet potato fries - as they can often be - seemed a little heavy, and a little greasier than I would prefer, but I've come to believe that this may just be the nature of the beast.

Our server was attentive, and while the place was packed, he still managed to pay close attention to our table and those around us.

Flip Side was a really great lunch experience, but I would certainly suggest that you should probably plan on waiting unless you're there during off-peak times."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places I've been to in a while! It's slightly pricey, but they have decent size portions for the price. The place is pretty small inside, so I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group. They have some of the best onion rings I've ever had, light, crunchy and very little oil/grease; I'd definitely recommend them. I'll be back to try the chili burger next time"}
{"text":"Best Place for burgers!  Burgers are always cook correctly food is always consistently good and a decent selection of beers!!!  If I lived closer I wouldn't go any where else for a burger!!!"}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian I am only able to evaluate my experience based on The Inverted Veggie Burger that comes with avocado, sprouts, arugula, vinaigrette served between two chickpea patties. Overall the food was okay, nothing crazy, an average meal.

On the service side I was disappointed in that the server seemed to want to get us in and out as quickly as possible (which could be due to the fact that the restaurant itself is small.) I almost felt that I was in a fast food restaurant (get you in and get you out) except for the fact that we were sitting at a table and had a waiter.

Bottom line, the food was okay, service could have been way better and for the price I feel there are other options."}
{"text":"While visiting family in Hudson I had the chance to eat at Flip Side. I think burgers are a favorite among everyone in the family so this was an easy choice for us to make on where to go for dinner. 

When we arrived we were greeted quickly and told that we could really sit wherever since so many tables were open. The restaurant itself isn't that big and so I can only imagine what it is like during a busy night. Luckily for us, we could grab a table quickly and not be crammed next to other groups. Our server brought over menus and offered to bring water over while we looked over the menu. She came back with our waters and asked if we needed other drinks. Others ordered beer and iced tea, but I just kept with water. The menu has a lot of burger varieties and some salads too. Since I am a turkey burger person I opted for the one they had with avocado and knew my decision quickly. Others ordered burgers of all sorts and there was a cobb salad on the table as well. 

The thing I think is strange is that the burgers are served alone and you have to order fries as a separate order which means you are sharing with everyone. It was okay for us to order a basket of fries to share, but if you don't like the people you are dining with or if you don't like sharing this could cause a problem. The basket of fries easily fed 3 of us. The burger I had was really tasty; difficult to eat with my hands, but I made due. I did have to use the fork towards the end since my avocado slid off the burger and I couldn't use my hands to pick it up. From what I remember, the fork was heavy and sturdy. 

Our sever came to check in on us often and made sure my water was always filled. She did a good job with bringing out refills and made sure we had everything we needed. 

Overall, this is a nice spot in Hudson. I can see why so many people enjoy the food. It is good and fresh. I think the only downside is that fries aren't automatically given with the burger, but again, ordering a basket works if you are willing to share."}
{"text":"Flip side is always yummy when we eat in! I highly recommend you try it-but eat in! To go is always missing something, not the right order, or not cooked to order. Must go and eat there"}
{"text":"Is this place has racism? They have several tables and they told me that I need to wait 30min while people is leaving. Also there is no waiting list. I even didn't get a table. Don't go to this place if you are not white. I made account for writing this. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great burgers and milkshakes. Their inverted veggie burger is great too, for those looking for a vegetarian option. Cozy environment and friendly staff."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite burger places. I am so happy that one opened in Rocky River so I don't have to drive all the way to Hudson anymore. 

My boyfriend and I sat at the bar and had excellent service. Ironically we were the slow ones who couldn't decide on a burger or which fries to get- not a bad problem by any means! I ordered the Black and Blue burger while he opted for the Forester burger. It's so nice to tell a place you want your burger cooked medium and it comes out (gasp) medium!! My burger is cooked perfectly every time I visit which is a huge plus for a burger joint to succeed."}
{"text":"I love this place! We order out or eat in from here on a weekly basis when we're in town (which is all summer). 

The burgers are amazing, and I highly recommend the Mac and Cheese with BBQ Brisket."}
{"text":"My waitress was amazingly helpful! I ended up getting the mushroom burger and my boyfriend got a plain cheeseburger. We also ordered a side of fries. Delic! Fair prices, friendly staff. I'd return. Although, the restaurant is small, but it's decor is very cool, bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend in Hudson, OH for the Indy Gathering Film Festival.  Wandered into Hudson for dinner.  Luckily, we got a seat at the bar at Flip Side.  Best burgers and fries I have every had.  We ate dinner there three nights in a row.  If you are ever in Hudson, saddle up to the coppertop bar at Flip Side and have Nate, the world's best bartender, help you navigate the list of craft beers.  All burgers are great.  I recommend Shawn's Burger which is a perfect 7 ounces of beef with bacon, aged provolone and a fried egg.  Messy but delicious."}
{"text":"8/26/13:

Absolutely delicious!

The only place in the area (besides B-Spot in Woodmere) where you can obtain high-quality, grass-fed beef to satisfy your burger cravings. 

The staff at Flipside is very kind and their menu offers many options. I've always gotten the \"Flipside\" burger with a side of fries ($3 extra, but yummy). Burgers are larger than B-Spot, making the $8-10 spent on them more worth the money.

There is no other burger restaurant I've been too that has good beef and burger without breaking the bank (unless you go to Burger Bar in San Fransisco!)."}
{"text":"Love the variety of burgers and drinks.  Great atmosphere to just hang out.  I recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very cool - the small space features a lot of worn wood and a faux \"found objects\" aesthetic. As I walked in the door. I was greeted with an overwhelming smell of burning bread, and there seemed to be a slightly smokey tinge to the air.

I found a seat at the bar, and was immediately acknowledged and given a beer menu. There are a dozen or so beers on tap, all well chosen.

I ordered a wedge salad, a burger, and fries. All three were tremendous. Really, the only complaints that I might make about the food are that the balsamic onions were slightly burned, and that the burger didn't come with pickles. It was,however, perfectly prepared to medium rare, and the salad was absolutely outstanding.

Service was more than capable, and was attentive without hovering. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really noisy for a lunch crowd.  I ordered the curry lamb burger and there wasn't anything curry about it.  How is a restaurant in this day and age doesn't have whole wheat buns??  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Burgers are good.  Yes good.  Are they great...meh not sure I would go that far.  I personally don't like their fries although many people do.  They must be doing something right because the place is always packed.  Would I go out of my way to go here...no.  Would I go there if I was in the area...yes.  No major complaints although the service can be slow sometimes."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were looking for a place to eat dinner. We both had the Flipside burgers and they were cooked to order and flavorful. Service was good and friendly and prices were reasonable. We will visit here again sometime."}
{"text":"Bailey is amazing!!!!! Also the burgers are really good and the macaroni and cheese is super yummy!!!!! I thoroughly enjoyed myself... also the margaritas are made perfect"}
{"text":"Wow, solid burgers!  I got the Flipside burger and my date ordered the Green Eggs and Ham burger.  Awesome!  And grass fed beef is the way to go for a high quality burger.  You WILL taste the difference!  We shared the fries which were seasoned and fried goodness.  This place gets packed.  On a Friday night we got lucky and scored 2 seats at the bar and ate there.  Otherwise the wait at 6 pm was already 45 minutes.  Great beer list.  Cool, rustic interior.  Expect long wait times on a weekend...the place isn't that big."}
{"text":"This was a tough one.
My food was great but my wife's food was terrible.
I tried her food. The special fries were limp.
The waitress was super rude and wouldn't let my wife get a word in about how bad the food was."}
{"text":"Best burgers around, and i highly recommend just their plain cheeseburger, but the service has gotten progressively worse and worse. The waiter was very sassy with me and made me feel very uncomfortable, and everything was rather slow despite being a slow evening. The beer selection is bad and overpriced, and some are served in snifter glasses for seemingly no reason (seriously, it's smaller than a pint, aren't marked as such, and who serves a wheat beer in a snifter?)."}
{"text":"Note: My opinions are somewhat consistent with other posters below who indicated that they really liked Flipside in the past, however, as of late not so much.  I'm officially in that camp now.

Went on a Wednesday evening around 6:00 pm.  Other than about 7 folks milling around the bar area, there was only one other couple in the whole dining area.  I was very shocked - for prime time dining hour.  That to me is communicating a message - you who management, you may want to note this.  I understand it was Wednesday and it would not be overly crowded, but I expected others besides just one lone couple - at the prime dinner hour.

I did note from their beer list that they are about $1- $2 higher on their drafts than most everyone else. I had the Flipside pale ale collaboration with Lucky Owl from Chagrin Falls. Usually when it is your \"house brew\", you price it less than all the others. No so here - $6 which was the same as some others.

I had the special - chicken banh mi - $12.  Considering they were touting all the different items on the sandwich - slaw, cilantro, aioli, jalepenos, etc. - I was expecting a flavor burst.  No such luck.  I'd say the sandwich was relatively tasteless.  For $12, which is a steep price for a chicken sandwich, it better sing and be very good.  This was quite far from it.

My dining companions had the \"Say Cheese\" burgers which are essentially $8.50 burgers.  No complaints although my wife (who also was a big fan of Flipside) did comment that she recently had a few burgers elsewhere that were better than this.

Ordered a plain fry and an order of onion rings.  Oddly, these came out before the meal and the girl that brought them out said that our meals are \"right behind this\".  Well, they must have got lost because they probably came out, what seemed to be, 10 min. later.  Fries and rings were good.  I fell in love with the fries previously, but I could say, not with this batch. Note: No where during this time did the waitress come by to check and give us assurance the our meals would be coming.

Overall, for what they charge - which is top dollar - the finished product needs to stand out and execute,  I could say this was not the case here, at all.  I think it will be a vey long while before I give Flipside another chance."}
{"text":"I've been here with my family a few times.
Pros: food has always been spot on! Burgers are unique and made with quality ingredients. Salads and Mac and cheese are to die for! Amazing shakes if you save room. Fries are crispy and full of flavor.

Cons: everything is a la Carte - which can get expensive quickly.  No kids menu. Bummer for a family night out.  I really don't the the majority of families want to spend $9 on a burger for a five year old.

Great service. We try to go before 4 pm to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"My four star rating for this place is strictly based on the food because if I took the service in to consideration, I would give it one star.

I have been to the flip side twice. The first time the service was terrible, but the food was great so we decided to give it another try only to get terrible service again. So terrible that the waitress brought my husband a beer and told him it was free because she had given us bad service. The table next to us were her friends so she spent the entire night chatting it up with her friends. Although nice of her tom give us a free beer, I would have preferred good service.
They have a very strange set up with the servers. They have people behind the bar, that take care of the people sitting at the bar but they also wait on the tables in the dining room. No wonder the service has been terrible! 
The decor is very cool. I was surprised about how small the place actually is but it works. The bar is very big and they have a great beer selection. 

Let's talk about the food!
I had the seared ahi sandwich both times. It was so delicious the first time that I didn't even want to try something else. It's a good size piece of seared ahi served on a bun and topped with a radish slaw that is absolutely amazing.. This slaw and the dressing makes this dish. The second time I ordered this I asked for extra slaw. I could eat a bowl of it..soooo good!
My husband had a black and blue burger. It's a peppercorn crusted burger with bleu cheese and port braised onions. It was very good.
We have tried the regular 3x fried fries with sea salt and herbs as well as the Mikey fries with truffle oil and cheese. Both were very good. My only complaint is the the fries are very small (not the size of the dish, but the actual fries), they are really short and kinda looks like you got whatever was at the bottom of the basket. Just wish they were a little bit longer.  Although the Mikey fries were also good, i wouldn't spend the extra three bucks and will stick to the sea salt fries next time. They are good but nothing really special. 
 Overall i would say the food here is delicious but they really need to work on their service. They also need to educate their staff a little more. When you drive up to the place the first thing you see are giant letters on their window advertising local grass fed beef. Both times i have been there I asked our server what farm their beef comes from and they have no idea. I realize that is not a question most diners would ask, but every article I have read about one red door, the flip side and downtown 140 ( same owners) boasts about how this chef uses local ingredients and buys responsibly. This is one of the reasons why I was drawn to these restaurants, because they support local farms. I would think that's one of the first things you would educate your staff on..... Just sayin...
 Will I return? Only because I am addicted to the ahi sandwich. Hopefully their service will get better."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Fries quite soggy, though. Friendly service. Cool spot. It's in a cool little area a few miles off 80. Definitely check it out if you're on a drive."}
{"text":"Finally, a burger place that delivers a perfectly seasoned and cooked burger. 

I came here a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend to give this place a shot after hearing about how good the place was. We went around 8:30 or so in the evening.  

The place was steady for the time, only half of the place was full. We were seated immediately given menus. I chose the flip side burger without bacon (i know, I sound like a crazy person, but I don't eat bacon) and my boyfriend got the \"say cheese\" burger with the addition of onion rings to the burger. All the items come ala carte so we ordered fries to share. 

It didn't take long to receive our meals. Both burgers were cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. And the fries were just the right about of crispy. I do think it is kind of a rip off to have two tiny onion rings cost a dollar extra to add to a sandwich.  

Overall, the experience was pleasant, but I will say it was very loud for only half the store being full. 

I plan on making another visit to flip side very soon."}
{"text":"So I it's time to bring the big guns out when you want a good burger!!!! Fresh as heck like they slay the meat in the back kind of fresh with great choices and options of burgers. Different is a good word for some of these burgers.. Perfect for a date bc it's hopping always!! Rain or shine flip side has it going on with whatever food you try or one of their many craft beers on tap. With the atmosphere you are transported to another city, state, or even country with the rustic modern vibe they cooked up for you! Bon apatite and salud!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger place...Burgers are juicy , grass feed beef....The amount of toping you can get are awesome.Working in the industry for 20 plus years, I can tell everything is prepared fresh,  with fresh ingredients, and our waitress comfirmed it..I enjoyed chit chatting with my friends and having drinks..It was nice as a women we all want sides but want to share , so there sides are great when going out with company..Atmopshere was inviting. I was impressed that the beer menu support alot local Cleveland area and state ohio brewerys, which to me is great, support each other...Staff was friendly, attentive,  and knowledgeable. We all will be back..."}
{"text":"Burgers are really good, however, it took us awhile longer to find a few side dish that we thought were really worth the calories! They are sold a la carte. I really like the veggie burger, however, my vegetarian daughter does not, and there is nothing else on the menu for her. My husband is a fan of the beer selection, as he is a craft beer fan."}
{"text":"so i was looking online at the Flip Side menu and one burger stood out - the Shawn's Burger.
 the thing about this burger is it has a sunny side up egg on it. I usually hate this. i want to like it but every time i get a burger with an egg on it, it just falls apart for me. 
another thing about this were the other toppings; tomato, lettuce, provolone cheese, grilled onions, bacon, mayo and especially SPICY PICKLES. 
the last thing about this hamburger is that it wasn't like every other burger w/ an egg. it was great. i don't know if it was specifically those pickles, but the burger was sensational.
Danielle had a chicken philly that she really liked as well. 
we shared an order of fries w/ mushroom gravy on the side (Danielle doesn't like mushrooms). they were fantastic. that gravy would be so good over an order of mashed potatoes. 
i had 2 of my favorite beers as well (Delirium Tremens and La Fin Du Monde). 
overall, i really loved the place. our server, Zachary was really nice and helpful. my only problem was it was kinda pricey and would really be the only reason i'd avoid driving to Hudson for this more often. $50 for a couple beers, a couple sandwiches and an order of fries is a bit steep. but, every now and again it would be a nice treat. i think my buddy Lucas would really enjoy that burger and i think he should give it a try."}
{"text":"didn't love it as much as i did the first time (in Hudson), but it was still good. 

this time my burger seemed to be overwhelmed by the bitter taste of the grilled onions and the fries seemed to be the nubs that get left in the fryer basket all night. 

i liked the physical restaurant more though, to be honest. i think i'd choose it over Hudson for that reason but i may get a different burger next time."}
{"text":"Great burger place.  A little small so better to go off peak hours. I was just in Breckenridge, Colorado and saw they had a location there so they must be doing something right. Their other place called Red Door is another story.  Do not like."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered here was fantastic! I would go here again just for the spectacular creme brulee beer! We ordered the Brie burger and brisket mac and cheese and it did not disappoint! The only negative thing was that it was a Friday night and it was completely dead, we thought it was closed!"}
{"text":"This place looked like it would rival one of my favorite burger joints in Northeast Ohio, The Rail.  However, the descriptions and expectations I had didn't quite meet up to the challenge.

Though the service was on point, attentive, and enthusiastic, the food was just okay.  The burger was not as juicy as I'd like.  I loved that no matter what you choose, you can substitute and modify anything...I think that's a crucial part of being this sort of place.  

Though it's not better than The Rail, I would say it's worth checking out.  Maybe, I just came on a not-so-great night."}
{"text":"More great burgers in Cleveland!

We love Michael Simon's B Spot but, wanted to try somewhere different. We tried to go to Burgers 2 Beer on Euclid Ave but for some reason they were closed early so we went to Flip Side instead.

Upon entering we were greeted by the host and seated immediately. A few seconds later our server Josh greeted us and asked if we had been before. We told him it was our first time so told us about what made Flip Side unique and about what they had to offer. 

After much deliberation I chose the Forester Burger which is topped with wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, crispy shiitake mushrooms and truffle aioli. I also added Middlefield Swiss Cheese as recommended by Josh. It was outstanding! The truffle aioli worked really well with the flavors of the mushrooms and really added to the flavor of the grass feed beef.

My wife went with the Smokey Burger which is topped with smoked beef brisket tossed in bacon BBQ sauce, pickled jalapeño peppers, smoked gouda cheese and covered in more bacon BBQ sauce. She loved it! 

Our daughter chose the Black n Blue Burger which is topped with black peppercorn crusted, Amish blue cheese and port braised onions. She loved hers as well!

We all shared a order of Truffle Fries covered in Truffle Oil and topped with Grana Pandana Cheese. They were excellent. 

Flip Side has really, really good burgers, great service and should not be missed if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"I tend to eat here at off times, so I don't have an issue with the service. The burgers are good, fries are even better. 

A burger will cost you $8-$10 but they come with a wide assortment of toppings. I like the green eggs and ham burger which has spinach, prosciutto and a fried egg. I also like the flipside burger which is pretty much a bacon cheese burger with blackened onions on it."}
{"text":"Yummo! Great fried egg topped burgers and the best sweet potatoes fries I've ever had! Good beer selection and I've seen plenty of milkshakes ordered. My husband actually craves these burgers and he is not a fancy burger guy!"}
{"text":"This place was such the surprise!

The burgers and truffle fries were sublime.  I was a bit concerned because when we showed up it appeared to be a homosexual hang out establishment. Not that there is anything wrong with that.  It was just not what I had anticipated.

Nevertheless, I couldn't recommend this place more.  By just for the food."}
{"text":"Easily the best burgers in the SE suburbs, and the various fry combinations are really yummy.  

Would really like to see a kids' menu, though - the lack of one makes it feel like they're not welcome."}
{"text":"Get the wedge salad with a burger patty on the side! Can't say I've had a bad meal here ever. Staffs great, tons of beer. Check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Burgers were good but the reason for the 2 star review is due to their overly absurd high priced draft beer!  The cheapest 16oz draft beer was $8 and the majority of them were $10!!!!   What a ripoff!  I would never come back here due to the price gouging on draft beer!  I can see charging $5 for a beer but $10!!!  No thanks.  What an insult!"}
{"text":"I live near Hudson so I'm in town pretty often and ever since I noticed they put this place in First & Main I've always wondered what it was like... after reading some pretty stellar Yelp reviews I finally decided to check it out and it was DELICIOUS. No exaggeration. I had the Forester Burger, and I absolutely loved it. I was also pleasantly surprised that the portion of fries was so generous (compared to B-Spot, ha!) One order is definitely enough for two people to share. And the beer list was great (I'm a sucker for any restaurant with a unique, quality beer selection and this place has got the good stuff).

I'll definitely be coming back again, and again, and again. I feel like I found a total gem of a restaurant, can't wait to bring more of my friends and family."}
{"text":"Food was awesome, service was awesome.  Giving 3 stars because they let a small purse dog out of its cage that a customer brought in, and the waitstaff and bartenders all played, petted and were licked by it.  Which I have no problem with, I am a huge dog lover.  But after playing with the puppy they proceeded to pick up and prep plates of food then deliver them to customers (GROSS).  My husband and I had to point this out to the manager before anyone washed their hands."}
{"text":"I've been here about 12 times.
Very good burgers.  Sweet potato fries are awesome.
Never had a meal I didn't like here.
Terrific beer selection.
Sometimes hard to get a seat, but otherwise excellent service."}
{"text":"I think the only reason I wouldn't give Flip Side 5 stars is because of the set up. Its very small. But the food was great!  5 stars says \"as good as it gets\" and I don't think this place is quite there for me.  But how many 5's are out there anyway?

Set up: 4 of us went to dinner on a Friday night around 6:30/7:00.

When we walked in I was surprised at how small it was. Actually, its not too small they just really don't need to have that large of a bar in that place. I think they could have more tables/booths (there are no booths) to accommodate diners. The bar just seemed to take up space as it wasn't even convenient to hang at the bar while waiting for a table because if you weren't sitting at the bar, you'd be standing over someon's table.  So we waited by the entrance probably about 30 min.  Much less time than the girl who was taking names at the door told us it would be (over an hour). She really had no idea. We could see for ourselves it wasn't going to be an hour. 

We did snag two seats at the bar (for the ladies) half way into our wait right by the entrance by luck since basically as soon as you walk in the door you are at the bar. So that is where we stood waiting for a table and annoying the dude at the bar trying to have a drink. He finally left so we grabbed his chair and the one next to him. Pretty large beer selection. Probably 8 or so beers on draft - I forget how many I saw on the wall. All craft beers though. They have a full beer menu to look over with a lot of bottled options too with decent descriptions of the beer. That was really nice. The bartender didn't seem to know one beer from the other and couldn't tell us what one would be like versus another. 

The place was full of kids when we got there which I thought was weird. Older kids like young teens with their parents. I think the Hudson folk are taking the whole family out here or groups of adults and their kids all getting together there. C'mon, take that business to Applebee's or TGI Friday's. Just doesn't seem that type of place to me but then again, this is Hudson. 

We got a table and were waited on pretty much immediately. Service was great. Its a burger place and they have some good options on the menu. I got \"Shawn's Burger\" which was a bacon cheeseburger with an egg over easy. VERY good! A bit sloppy because of the egg but you can't go wrong with an egg burger. Again, very good and cooked as requested - Medium. My wife got the \"Green Eggs and Ham Burger\" which has prosciutto and spinach as well as a crisp of parmesan. Of course, I got half of that too! Very good burger as well! Cooked to her liking (med well/well) with the egg cooked well too (not runny). No one had any complaints about their food and it didn't take long to get it at all. We all got the \"triple cooked\" fries (one got the sweet potato fries which I didn't try). Fries were cooked pretty close to perfect, crispy yet soft inside.  One order can probably be shared between two people. I could do without the herbs on them though (like B Spot). 

The girls got shakes which seemed to be a hit. Nice little selection of shakes and not just the standard. Some interesting flavors. 

Others have compared this place to Michael Symon's B Spot and I would concur as I did the same above. Very comparable in trendy atmosphere and burger selection, inventive combinations, and taste. 

The decor was weird though. Not sure what they are going for. Western/Alamo/library/warehouse type deal. Whatever. 

I'll add, this is not a place for large parties.  A party of 8 came in (the lady jumped in front of us and put her name in before we could - rude) and of course made the \"waiting area\" even more cramped.  I saw they eventually sat this party at a table for 4.  Must be what they do just to get people sat because that bunch of kids I mentioned before were all sitting around a smaller table too while their parents were at another table.  Don't come here with a big group.  First, you should no your location before bringing a group and second, this place doesn't know how to accommodate you with more than a few people in your party.   They just seemed unsure what to do with the tables.  Just my observation.

Overall I liked it and would go back. Great burgers and great beers."}
{"text":"Flip Side has amazing food and although it's small the atmosphere is very cool.  My last visit we all had a different burger and each one was great!  The Red Door Burger is one of the best I've ever had. The burger (can't remember the name) with the most perfectly fried egg ever was amazing!  The yolk was exactly how I hope to have it every time I order a sandwich with egg although I rarely get it that way, perfection. The only reason I would not give 5 stars is because our waitress was not very good. She came over to tell us she was leaving and wanted to check us out, which was fine, but she didn't even give us a couple minutes to get our payments together. She stood there and waited and we were forced to put our food down, get the money out and then finish our meals. I would have like a few minutes at least, I'm certain she knew she was leaving much longer before that that she could have given us a little notice."}
{"text":"Just another burger joint but in a great location.  Love that they have old school beers.  Only giving them 5 stars because of downtown Hudson.  If anywhere else, 4 stars."}
{"text":"The grouper sandwich is just as good as you can get in Florida!!!  Meaty and grilled to perfection!!!!!  Flown in fresh."}
{"text":"I'm a pescetarian , who loves to frequent nearby burger joints for the specialty fries and shakes and the occasional veggie burger. I have to say, The ahi tuna burger is amazing, it's one of the best things I've eaten. B spot and The Rail need to take pointers from this place. The French fries are delicious. But man, I crave the perfectly seared ahi tuna and giant lobster drinking Guinness."}
{"text":"Good burger,  poor service the bartenders were overwhelmed,  would have ordered fries and a shake if she ever acknowledged me.  Then I watch her spend 10 minutes explaining the menu to the people next to me.  Guess I'll try again when they're slower"}
{"text":"Food - B+ Burgers are not as good as The Rail but definitely above average. At least they are prepared to how you order them. Ask for medium-rare and you'll get medium rare. The onion rings are buttermilk battered I believe which led to them being someone flimsy. The cheese fries, which my wife had, were good.

Beer - They have a very good selection of craft beers on draft and in bottle. Huge plus. Would like to see a couple more lagers on draft. I believe they only had one. The grapefruit hefeweizen was actually a radler and was quite sweet (think summer shandy). Usually I look up my beers before I order them. I did not on this one and should have. They could have labeled it correctly.

Aura - This place is loud. Very loud. So if it's more than half full expect to have to talk very loudly so your guests can hear you. 

One reviewer says they don't take reservations but they do allow you to call ahead and get on a waiting list. I didn't think restaurants did that anymore. Must be a suburb thing. So when we got there, no one was waiting, but we had to wait 30 minutes because of the call-aheads. We usually sit at the bar but it was full. This restaurant will allow children to sit at the bar which I found odd, but then again, it's the burbs and I assume they want to be family friendly.

Price - 2 burgers + 2 sides + 4 beers + tip = $75. This is about $25 more than average for the same quality at other local establishments. It's for this reason alone that I will likely not go back here."}
{"text":"Yes, you're going to spend a little bit of money here.  And it will be totally worth it!! (Especially because you'll leave so stuffed you wont have to eat the rest of the day.)

Flip Side by far is our absolute FAVORITE place in Hudson.  Looking for a great beer?  They have an amazing selection on tap.  Want a great bartender?  Go Wednesday or on the weekends.  Nate is THE BEST!  Want a place that feels like Cheers?  This is the place.  Just want to watch a game?  Flip Side!

Now let's talk food.  The burgers are amazing.  The sweet potato fries are something I crave for regularly.  Best onion rings ever.  But the chips, fries, mac and brisket, tuna burger (yes, we've tried just about everything there) are all CRAZY good.

My kids love it here, and it is a top request when they get to pick a place to eat out.

If by some slim chance you have room, even the milk shakes will make you shake with delight.

This place is near impossible to get into during lunch and dinner hours, so don't try if you're in a hurry.  But well worth the wait or going mid-day or after the dinner rush."}
{"text":"This joint is great local burger spot. I've never had a bad meal here. Beers selection is very good. Highly recommend. For those with negative feedback just ask the waiter/waitress how they recommend it cooked and how much the beer costs. Heck - if you're that cheap just order a can of schlitz. I bet they have it in the cooler."}
{"text":"I have found a replacement for that *other* burger restaurant that only brought disappointment to my belly.  Sorry, Michael Symon, but you have been trumped.

I've been dying to go to FlipSide for over a year...the only problem was that they didn't open until just recently!  They were well worth the wait.

The restaurant is quite small, but I loved the decor.  It was fun and a bit edgy.  Just what a classy burger place should be.  Service was prompt and friendly, without being overbearing.  Again, perfect.

Their menu offers many different options (even some for vegetarians) that all sound delectable.  It took much effort to not ask for one of everything.  Somehow, the BF and I exerted self-control and sampled the following:

The Side Salad- This was made of mixed field green, cucumbers, carrots, and crispy shallots topped with balsamic vinaigrette.  There was magic in that vinaigrette.  Even by BF who hates anything green loved the salad.

Triple-Cooked French French Fries- These babies were cooked perfectly, but the herbs didn't really win me over.  To be fair, though, I'm completely biased and love Lola Fries and GHT Fries so much, I don't know that any others will compare.

Crispy chili rubbed onion rings w/remoulade- Neither of us were terribly impressed by these.  To be fair, I've never met an onion ring that impressed me.  They weren't chili-rubbed, but dusted with chili powder.  While the dusting added some flavor, the onion rings were probably our least favorite dish.

The Smokey Burger- This delectable burger was topped with smoked beef brisket, pickled jalepeno peppers, smoked gouda cheese, and served with a side of bacon BBQ sauce.  The burger was cooked perfectly and oh-so-flavorful and juicy.  Nothing beats grass-fed beef.  The toppings are worked together to create bliss on a bun.  THis was my BF's burger and I wanted to steal it for myself.

The Forester Burger- The on had wild mushrooms, caramelized onions, a crispy shiitake mushroom and was served with a side of truffle aioli.  While this burger was quite tasty, I've had better mushroom-topped burgers elsewhere.  So, just like the fries, I was unfairly biased against this one.

Apple Pie Shake- Vanilla ice cream, chunks of apple pie, caramel sauce...and a little bit of heaven for good measure.  This was also ordered by the BF, and he stated that it was better than that other apple pie shake at that other burger place, even though this one didn't have bacon.  While it was tasty, I wasn't blown away by it.

I give them 4 stars instead of 5 because there is another burger place in my home state of CT that blows this place out of the water.  However, I do think I need to sample more burgers because I just might not have found my 5-star here.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Working in Chagrin Falls and being a West Sider I had never heard of Flipside.  I went for lunch with co-workers and it was excellent.  I was glad they opened a west-side location in Rocky River close to home.  We've been to the Rocky River twice, both times were great.  I've had the Flipside Burger, Smokey Burger and the Black & Blue Burger.  It's not often a place cooks a burger just right every time.  We've been skipping the fries and splitting an order of Mac n Cheese with BBQ Beef Brisket which is delicious.  I thought I was the only one who did this at cookouts! It is a perfect amount to split and they will bring it in two bowls.  Another tip, if you want fries, split an order as the sides of fries are HUGE."}
{"text":"So, we stopped at the Flip Side twice, once for a 5$ Burger night, and once for their Brunch, both of which were delicious. 
Located in Rocky River just over the border from Lakewood, the Flip Side is nestled in a quaint little outdoor mall that has a lot of great little shops and places of diversion. 

The Foods we got, from the burgers to the Brunch Items, were tasty and well made, with great service and a nice view outside. Parking is a bit sparse, but there is parking out front and around the area, which may force you to walk around and check out some of the neat shops nearby. 

Overall, we \"flipped\" for the Flip Side and enjoyed this warm little place (Also, make sure you check out the North Bound Deer by the restrooms:)"}
{"text":"Went to call in a order of a burger and two sides of fries and a salad at 9:30pm 2/20/17 and was told the kitchen was closed .. it says that the hours for tonight for the rocky river location are till 10:00pm I was confused and dumbfounded frankly if I were to of drove all the way there would I have been turned away at the door? That's bad business in my opinion and I feel like the last few times I have gone into this location the wait staff were rude and acted like they really didn't want to be there. I'm deeply saddened by this as the food is amazing but because of this I'm going to have to part ways with this location it's just disappointing. I hope this comment reaches someone who cares because it just seem like no one does."}
{"text":"Very good burgers. Usually get the Chili Pepper or Mikey Burger. Their fries are also really good. The restaurant, beer selection, and food are all good. It is busy almost every night. Wish the restaurant was larger to accommodate. Great restaurant concept though."}
{"text":"If your willing to spend a little extra for a great burger this is the place to go! They have a great selection and an enormous amount of beers.   The burgers are unique and are amazing.  My wife and I moved to Ohio about a year ago and this was one of the first restaurants we tried and loved!  We bring all of our guests to Flipside!  Probably some of the best burgers we have ever had and better than all the so called best burger places in NE Ohio.  The shakes with liquor, Kobe beef corn dogs, and sweet potato fries are favorites as well!  Only thing that brings this to a 4 star is the size of the joint. It's so small that there is always a 30-45 minute wait."}
{"text":"Just left. Sat at our table for ten minutes while two people at bar just stared around and cleaned menus.  Waitress finally heads over and checks two tables and then walks away.  We decide to leave and explain to host who says ok.  We usually go every week for our chick and waffles but that service is inexcusable -try Market instead!"}
{"text":"$7 for one Sierra Nevada Torpedo is INSANE. I can buy a 6 pack of Torpedo for $8.99. Somehow, Flipside, Hudson thought it was on Manhattan Island and charged NYC prices for a brew. Wow...  Talk about mis-pricing. But if you want to drop $40 for 4 beers, swing on by!"}
{"text":"So to say this is my new favorite burger place sounds like an exaggeration since I am a total lover of B Spot but it is. This is our second time here and my second time having the One Red Door Burger. It's the best burger I have EVER had!!!! My hubby had the Chili Pepper Burger. Said it wasn't as spicy as the name implies yet it was delicious!!! Sorry I didn't post pics but the margarita got the better of me! The onion rings are superb and the fries are also good. I would totally recommend this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great burger - got the One Red Door and loved it. Juicy and tons of flavor. I saw at least 4 other burgers I needed to get. Don't skip the fries - truffle oil and cheese were amazing and enough to share. Milkshake wasn't great and boozy add in didn't last past first sips. The only problem with Flip Side is straw diameter - seriously small for pop and far to small for chunky milkshakes. I need a hose ppl!! Nice staff and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a little on the small side so get here early if you want a seat.  I got the sweet potato fries with an awesome (not overpowering) horseradish mustard sauce.  I think this was my first time not having a sweet sauce to go with my sweet potato fries and I loved it!  I also got the French Flip burger thinking that the Beer Braised short ribs would replace the beef patty, but I was wrong.  I ended up removing the patty because I didn't want a beef overload.  The burger patty was tasty when I tried it separately and the short rib sandwich was great too."}
{"text":"Recently went to Flipside in Hudson !! Enjoyed the atmosphere, sat at the bar , excellent selections of beers and wines and the food was fabulous !! Burgers were excellent made with grass fed beef !!- Enjoyed the service !! My guest and myself had a great time !! Special thanks to Michael and Nate at the bar !! Highly recommend the place !!
Thanks
DR MD"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, wide selection of craft beers and specialty drinks. The food is fresh, made from scratch. Grass fed beef, fresh cut fries, and everything is made to order!"}
{"text":"Flipside didn't disappoint in the food category. Truffle fries were delish, though I think they'd shine even more if served some sort of dipping sauce, maybe an aioli. My boyfriend and I each got burgers and they were huge, cooked to our preference, and full of yummy, fresh toppings. We paced ourselves and saved half for leftovers so not to be overstuffed. I didn't get any alcohol, but they had tons of craft beers on draft, spiked milkshakes, and a fully stocked bar. Speaking of, we ate at the bar because the wait was so long on a Friday evening. Plan ahead if you have a big party for this small establishment. We even checked in on the NoWait app before leaving our place 25 minutes away, and when we showed up, there was still 7 parties ahead of us. The people who came in directly after us had just got seated as we were leaving so if we hadn't swooped up a spot at the bar, we would've waited too long to be able to enjoy the meal for what it was. Definitely comparable to the atmosphere and food style of B Spot and similar \"hipster burger joints.\"  I'm sure we'll return someday!"}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and the cheese fries very good.  I've been there multiple times and the quality is still fine."}
{"text":"Shaun burger was out of this world. The bacon was incredible along with the perfectly fired egg on top.  For a side we had the chili cheese fries and they were delicious.

Service was excellent.  

Will be back soon and often."}
{"text":"The hamburger was very good, didn't care for the hamburger bun, the fries were good but soft, not at all crispy like I expected, going from the menu says tripled fried. The chocolate milk shake, not very big and kinda of thin, not thick enough. The toppings for the hamburger were sliced too thin, w white chunk lettuce, which I can't stand. Prefer green lettuce. 

I give bad review because of the outrageous noise level, the Rail, also has same problem with noise. The B Spot continues to be my fav, for hamburgers, crispy fries and very thick milk shakes."}
{"text":"Good fries, burgers and milkshakes. They even were patient with us,as we left after closing. The only thing keeping them from five stars was high prices and small portions on burger and toppings and sauce. The milkshake was yummy."}
{"text":"First time having a fried egg on my burger. It was very good. I recommend getting Shawn's burger. I had the regular fries which were decent. Cool place to hang out and get some burgers and beers."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the black and blue burger man oh man still thinking about it - this ain't no BW3 black and blue burger - this one lays out all the competition and those sweet potato fries - can I get a witness? Mmmmmm boy they good 
I'm not a fan of the High chair but they seemed to be the only kind seats in the place - a couple of regular feet on the floor seats would have made me more comfortable.
I'm thinking maybe carry out next time black and blue burger and the sweet potato fries with a coke mmmm am I dreaming again - oh supertramp"}
{"text":"I love that this place is practically at the top of my street. I also hate that this place is practically at the top of my street. 

The menu has plenty of specialty burger options. They frankly all look good. My goal is to eventually try them all. 

I've enjoyed the fries and various topping options. I love the mushroom topping.

Beer list is nice. Good variations. Would love to see more local options, such as Fat Head's.

Decor is nice and casual, a bit fun and funky. 

Most important to me...Burger places must get the burger cooked as expected. I want mine medium rare, and I've been happily surprised with the correct doneness so far."}
{"text":"I completely agree with previous reviewers complaining about the overpriced beer.  However, I've come to realize that the beer prices at Flip Side are the necessary entry fee to pay in order to access the main event, in all its glory.  Kinda like popcorn at the movies.  It does help, though, that the beer selection happens to be great - both White Rajah and Head Hunter on tap.  Find me another place in NE Ohio offering those two heavyweights in draught format.  

The main event, of course, is the burger patties, which are done in true contemporary food enthusiast style on a flat top grill so that the high quality, hight fat content ground beef can caramelize in its own juices.  That's pretty much all you need to know.  The patties are so expertly seasoned and seared that it really doesn't matter what else they put on it - caramelized onions, bleu cheese, fried onion rings, bacon, habanero spread, etc etc - it's a juicy flavor explosion without equal ( for the record, it's also a very rich and heavy eating experience, so be careful about how many of those tempting appetizers you splurge on...sharing fries or tempura asparagus and mushrooms with another person works just fine) .  There is a downside to these burgers, though.  In your Post Flip Side world, you will find that most other pub-style burgers, especially those cooked on a grill where the juices drip into the fire and disappear forever, will inevitably disappoint."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars, but if I could do 3.5 I would. I would not consider this a 4 star burger joint.

I'm passing through Ohio, and traditionally my husband and I always pick a new place to eat, I chose this based on yelp reviews, plus I really wanted a good, greasy burger.

Ordered two burgers (the Firestarter and the forester) and an order of truffle fries to split. Both burgers were ordered medium rare. The menu has a lot of variety, it's hard to choose which burger I wanted and these are serious life changing decisions!

The burgers are large and they do taste fresh. They both had good flavor. Both burgers were cooked incorrectly. Both burgers were well done and I think well done burgers lose some of the good, beefy flavors. I also asked for no tomatoes, and it did come on the side (I guess that is not the end of the world, but I cannot stand tomato juice at all, so I didn't eat the lettuce and pickles either. (Yes I'm weird). As previously stated, good flavors but way too well done.

My husband said his burger was good.

The truffle fry portion was large and good, I wish it had a little more truffle flavoring, but it wasn't bad. The fries were perfectly done. 

I ordered at 930 at night for carry out, place closes at 1030. Maybe they were trying to push out the food as fast as possible and rushed. The guy who took my order was rushing me and I had to repeat myself a few times (maybe he wasn't paying attention).

When I pass through again, I might try it again, just because I want to trust the reviews."}
{"text":"The food is good - but not worth the price... we paid $36 for 2 burgers, a side of fries and a coke. 

The service was ok... nothing special. Had an empty glass for over 5 minutes (which is a serious offense in my husband's book). 

It's not a restaurant we would go back to when there are so many other options."}
{"text":"Visited Flip Side for the first time on a Sunday evening. This was my first visiting this area and I'll definitely be back to explore some of the other shops and restaurants around here. 

The restaurant is really small but we sat at the bar - great draft selection and was really excited to see Jackie O's Brewery from Athens on the list. Decor is distressed vintage - cute stuff to look at, love the bookshelf within the wall. 

Sweet potato fries were amazing, burgers were cooked to perfection and perfectly filling - granted I was starving. It's definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"My family went in on a Sunday evening.  We got sat immediately and waited........and waited........and waited.........and waited. We waited until we decided to leave.  No drinks, no \"I'll be right there\",  no \"give me a minute, we're busy\".  Nothing.  Called manager directly after and he didn't seem to care.  Would love to rate the food but can't.  They may be great burgers, but I've never had one so I wouldn't know.  Very disappointed after looking forward to it."}
{"text":"FlipSide is a favorite of ours. The burgers are hands down the BEST I've ever had.  They literally make my mouth happy. They're the kind of burgers where you take one bite and then sit there with your eyes closed just trying to savor every last atom of deliciousness for as long as possible. SO ...... GOOD!!

They are made with grass-fed beef, which has so much flavor it's ridiculous. The triple cooked fries are amazing, the specialty beers and milkshakes are divine, and even the salad is phenomenal. 

I usually get the Black and Blue burger, which is crusted with peppercorns and topped with a large dollop of chunky blue cheese ... Yum! My husband gets something different every time. Last time it was the Shawn Burger I believe, the one that's topped with a sunny side up egg. He loved it and it looked so good - the egg yolk was hot but still runny enough to drizzle over the grass fed beef in every bite. I might get that next time, but I do love my Black and Blue burger, so I don't know. Tough call.

The place is always packed during prime hours, so try to go a little before or after lunch/dinner hours to avoid a long wait. It's so worth the wait though. Love it! We will go back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't make an amazing-knock-your-socks-off-best-you've- ever-had-in-your-life kind of burger.  

What they do make is a well-cooked, well portioned burger and an assortment of sides that I found inventive and a nice alternative to a standard burger and fries joint.  This is a solid four star restaurant partially for not only serving local grass-fed beef but having the wherewithal to hire chefs who know how to cook it properly. What else makes them four stars?  A proper beer list.  The wine list was a little lacking but they did carry Santa Barbara Pinot Noir which was a pleasant surprise.  

For the record, I had the Simplicity with a side of fries with salt and herbs.  Keeping it classic.  My husband had the Black and Bleu with the homemade chips.  Not a huge fan of the Black and Bleu but bleu cheese is subjective so order at your own risk.  Homemade chips were good but nothing amazing."}
{"text":"The concept is great and the original in hudson ohio was awesome but while it started out as a good place with good food, the place has gone waaaaay downhill! I and many others have described how horrible the service has been  we tried it one last time tonight after a few bad experiences and odds are we won't be back! The waiter said he knew little about the draft list since they just changed it and he wasn't interested in finding answers to our questions! Friends have talked about how the servers were not attentive at all and my wife mentioned how she called the manager over a few weeks ago about an issue and the manager looked at her and said \"oh sorry about that\" and walked away! A friend told me it's no different from going to McDonalds......just costs a lot more!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! The restaurant itself is very small so anticipate to wait a bit for a table, but I can promise you that the food will be worth the wait. The staff is friendly and also helpful if you are a new customer and need help deciding on your order. The menu has vegan and vegeterian friendly options so you can still enjoy the atmosphere of this restaurant even if you aren't a meat lover!"}
{"text":"I brought my father here to try to burger and he loved it--they even cut it down the middle so we could share. The sweet potatoe fries were his and my favorite accompanied by what I think was aioli sauce. Overall it was a great dining experience and the vibe/decor was an added bonus. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I'm addicted, can't stop eating here, and it's ruined burgers at every other restaurant for me. Chicken sandwiches are excellent as well. Great craft beer selection, great servers, great atmosphere. The only problem is that it can be hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Northeast Ohio! Flipside specializes in creative burgers, but there are quite a few other appetizing options on the menu, as well. 

My favorite is the Mikey Burger with sweet potato fries and horseradish sauce on the side. There's also a long and rotating list of draft beers, and they serve cocktails, too. It's one of those places where I'd really like to try everything on the menu. 

The ambiance is kitschy in a good way, and there are TVs above the bar to watch games. The only negative is its size. Some of the other Flipside restaurants are much bigger, but the Hudson venue - which is the original - is quite small. Be prepared to wait or try to go during an odd time. It's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Good burger. Perfect mid rare. I guess there is a market for $8 cheeseburgers. Fries extra."}
{"text":"The mac n cheese was perfect! The burgers were a little over cooked but our server didn't even ask how we wanted them cooked. I'm crazy for toppings on my burger but there is a point when it's too much."}
{"text":"Get there early, only 12 tables. 4:30 is about the best time to go to get a seat for an early dinner.   Great food, + indie rock music= a great time."}
{"text":"Succulent burger but the real star here is the sweet potato fries.  Unlike others served everywhere else in this county, these, I believe, are fried and then seasoned with savory herbs.  I believe they are fried, perhaps twice, in peanut oil.  I thought these were the best prepped and served sweet fries I've ever had, and I've sampled many.  Burger very juice, yummy, great quality beef plus very rich and satisfying."}
{"text":"I love a great burger and Flip Side in Hudson certainly serves up a good burger.  We generally only eat organic, natural and locally grown beef, pork and chicken at home. When eating here, I can tell the beef is quality.  I love that it is local, Ohio raised beef.

My favorites are the Flipside burger and the Forrester.  I love the Kobe Beef Corndogs..what a great twist on a childhood favorite.  

CONSISTENTLY Good food, great service, nice atmosphere and reasonably priced. 

Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Amazing place... My son and i loved it. Fries and burgers were delicious! Service was excellent. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"While on a quest for the perfect burger, I read an article in Akron Life & Leisure that described some of the more eclectic burger joints in the area. While some have been disappointing, this one was not!   Great burger, done the way it was ordered. For a burger place that is paramount.  I was also looking for a certain beer that they did not  carry, but the bartender/waiter suggested something and it was absolutely wonderful.  Great Burgers, Great Beers, Great Background Music.  A very enjoyable afternoon."}
{"text":"My wife and I were excited to try this place after looking at the menu. First thought that comes to your mind when you walk in is, wow is it small in here. Our server was really nice and very attentive. I ordered the brisket mac n cheese, not very cheesy really liquidy and not much flavor. I also ordered the French flip burger, the burger and the braised beef was excellent.  I just wish the bun was able to handle the juices. The bottom bun was completely soggy, maybe they should have let the meat rest for a minute. My wife ordered the chicken sandy sandwich she thought was good but she didn't like the bun. Both sandwiches came with lettuce, tomato and pickle on the side, the only problem was the lettuce was a little wilted and the tomato looked old.  We also tried the inverted veggie burger. Awsome idea to have a veggie option just poor execution. No flavor. Maybe next time we will have a better experience."}
{"text":"Best cocktail I've ever had! Salty Dog. Our waiter, Ryan, was very knowledgeable and attentive without being cloying."}
{"text":"Delicious, messy burgers- a must try!! Don't forget to try the truffle fries with a side of truffle aioli. Amazing! One of my favorite burger spots in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Great tasting burgers. Nice atmosphere. Good choices for draft beers and knowledgeable staff about their product. I'll be back."}
{"text":"OMG!
Best burger I have ever had in my life! Or at least in the past 20 years.

Tried something crazy different, the Curry Lamb Burger and it was amazingly good. Juicy, flavorful, and fresh.

Also sampled the Tempura Asparagus & Mushrooms, another victory!

Be prepared for a wait as Tuesday evening was just as packed as Saturday evening, but it took no longer than half of an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Hudson. Consistently delicious with a fun and lively atmosphere. Long lines thurs-sunday. Bar seating is best."}
{"text":"You have to come to Flipside either very early or late.  If you come between 5-8 PM, you will wait, often up to an hour.  Once seated, the service is good, beer selection above average and burgers and fries excellent! I've never had a bad flavored meal here. The milkshakes are my daughters favorite. The bill is often shocking, especially if you get alcohol.  Kind of pricey for burgers but the quality is great for an occasional treat for the family."}
{"text":"Really delicious food and great atmosphere. Don't leave without getting a milkshake for dessert!"}
{"text":"High end burger joints seem to be the going trend. Flip Side is one of the more recent additions in downtown Hudson.

The burger was great. I got the Smokey, with smoked brisket and smoked gouda. Great smoked flavor and it didn't even need the BBQ sauce. I ordered the Shitake Mushrooms and Asparagus Tempura side. It was great, the breading was super thin and crisp, although very small as other reviewers have pointed out. I could have used a few more mushroom caps. The alcoholic shake really hit the spot.

Our server was super friendly and the wait wasn't too bad for anything. The decor is cool. Lots of distressed stucco. The bathroom situation is weird. The sister joint next door, One Red Door, shares the hallway with the restrooms. There are about 5 doors that look the same in that hallway. When you go to the restroom, make a mental note of where you went, otherwise you will end up in Red Door's kitchen. They really could use some signage. I felt like I was in a maze. 

Overall, great food and drinks. But be prepared to fork over some cash."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices.
The burgers are pretty amazing and tasty.
The staff was polite and friendly.
Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"There's no debate. Flip Side kicks BSpot's a$$ when it comes to good burgers.

BSpot is such a Bobby Flay knock off it's sad.  Symon's even tried Bobby's signature Crunchified burger by adding potato chips.  Symon also has an awful selection of sauces.  At Flip Side it's just ketchup and mustard.

Flip Side's grass fed beef is the best.  Their beer selection is fantastic and their fries are traditional fresh cut and sweet potato.  No rosemary here.

Great service too!"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Service is spectacular- super friendly and accommodating.  The burgers are delish.  Thanksgiving dinner burger lives up to the name."}
{"text":"I was honestly surprised to see such a place in Hudson. Hudson has had its share of mediocre Italian restaurants, relic restaurants from another era that haven't quite kept pace and so on. Flip Side is actually a great burger place with local ingredients and unique preparation which is common in Cleveland but not in Hudson. The best part is that they not only brought Cleveland food to Hudson, they kept Cleveland prices.

Definitely pay it a visit if you're in the area. If you have to drive past Flip Side to head to Bar Cento, don't do it. Save the gas money and enjoy a similar experience closer to home."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere awesome service if you love top notch burgers and fries not too many places better than this on the planet 
They also offer amazing milkshakes that might be for dessert but I will try one of their amazing beers to go with your beef.

{"text":"It's not bad, but it's nothing special, I guess.  

Decor: I got this vibe that this place wants to be like B-Spot.  That's not a bad thing, just a note on the overall feeling of the restaurant and its theme.  The overall decor is old-wood and concrete.  It's kind of a steakhouse vibe.  The menus are paper in a clasp binder.  They looked good at one time, but the menus are quite beat up, stained, and falling apart.

Service: The bartenders and servers are great--I've never had bad service.  So A+ to them.  Everyone seems attentive and I've never had anything to complain about.

Food:  The burgers are good.  It's certainly better than any fast food joint, but my taste buds don't have an orgasm off these burgers either.  I will say the list of burgers are more creative than anything else in Hudson.  When I broaden the scope to include Cleveland, it mostly contains ideas that have been done before.  I think this just represents Hudson finally getting a place with more burger options.  For the most part, my burgers have been spot on temperature wise; however, my wife has had a few undercooked burgers (a medium cooked rare or mid-rare).  My only real complaint is that the fries are ala cart, and the portion of the fires are absurdly large.  I would rather just get a small amount with the burger than have to order a wasteful amount.

Drinks: The beer list has a lot of good options.  It's no 300-beer list-o-thon, but they keep a good stock and they always have a few non-standard items on the tap.  That means you can go fancy or you can just have a Miller.  There's something for everyone.

Overall:  It's not a bad joint, but doesn't represent the second coming of the Christ in the form of a tasty burger  (I don't think B-Spot is the Christ burger either, if that means anything to you).  In the end, I would go back since the menu has a number of options and the service is good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, good beer and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great burgers in a fun atmosphere. Lots of variety and twists on common burgers. They also have a full bar and lots of TVs in view."}
{"text":"Solo dined here in early December...first visit.   Sat at the bar and the place was packed for a Tuesday night.  Disclosure: I'm not much a burger eater (just a few per year)  so my comments should be taken with that in mind.  I had the forester burger (mushrooms and caramelized onions with truffle aioli) and it was cooked to perfection.  Something I would definitely order again during my once-per-year visit back to Ohio.  Had the regular fries as a side dish - too much for me to finish given how great the burger was plus two Stellas.  Service was fast & friendly."}
{"text":"Arrived @ 6:45 on a Friday night, so I was anticipating a wait. 45 minutes seemed a little extreme for a burger joint but it wasn't an issue as the weather was accommodating.  My wife and I went next door for a drink at the One Red Door bar.  We received a text indicating our table was ready. When I put our name on the wait list, the hostess indicated that once we received our text, we should give it 8 minutes so that they could prepare the table. Again, no problem.  We waited about 10 minutes before heading back to Flip Side. When we entered I flagged down the hostess and gave her my name. Her response, \"Oh, I am sorry, I prematurely texted you. Your table is not ready; it will be about 10 minutes.\" Okay, not a huge deal except there were 3-4 open tables.  When I asked her about each open table, she replied they were reserved. Hmm, wasn't that what I did 50 minutes earlier?

Okay, so we were seated. We were then greeted by a less then enthusiastic waitress that promptly took our drink order.  When she returned to take our burger order I asked if we had a choice on how they were cooked. I am a medium-rare, tending towards rare. She explained that all of the burgers were cooked medium to well. Again, no worries. Medium was fine and much to my dismay, my wife prefers well done so we should be okay.

We received our burgers @ 15 minutes later. My burger was interesting. One side was rare and the other well done. How do you accomplish that?  My wife's was medium rare leaning towards rare. Okay, the waitress must have switched the \"done\" request.  When my wife alerted the waitress (after one bite) that her burger was rare and she wanted another one, the waitress incredulously responded, \"You want another burger?!\". Uh yea! For $10 a burger I damn sure want another burger. What was she suggesting, they microwave what was on her plate?  When they finally brought out her burger (I had been done for 10 minutes now) the replacement was well done....and also 1/3 the size of the original. So either they said, screw this couple we are not giving them a full size replacement or their only way of serving a well done burger fast was to make it a fraction of the normal size.

Long story long, for $40 I can make two 2\" steaks and have a bottle of wine at home. We will never return. No apology from the waitress or manager or an offer to provide the burger at no -charge.  Penny wise dollar foolish. You got your money for one night but lost potential business for life."}
{"text":"So I think I need to schedule a trip here just to visit flip side. We stopped last June while traveling and my hubby can't stop talking about that awesome place we stopped at in Ohio. Don't debate - it's AWESOME food-get the burger and savor it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came in here this past wknd and will never go back. We were seated quickly as the place was full but no wait. We were not greeted by our server for at least 15 minutes at which point he awkwardly asked us if we wanted waters or a menu. Thinking the service at the bar would be quicker we snagged 2 stools as they opened, only to be even more disappointed. After waiting 5 minutes the bartender/manager came over to clean and wipe the bar down without so much as even acknowledging our presence let alone say hello. He then proceeded to answer a phone call prior to greeting us. It was at this point we left the restaurant and decided we will not be returning to this location. Hudson has plenty of good restaurants and service of this caliber should simply not be tolerated."}
{"text":"Great hamburger, I got the Shawn my husband got one with mushrooms, we split them and Shawn was my favorite. Best onion rings I have ever had. Wish there was more room, it was worth the wait! Also had my first Moscow Mule, bartender let me try ginger beer before I ordered, I appreciated that."}
{"text":"Had the smokey burger: burger, brisket, BBQ sauce, and Gouda, which was all good.  Disappointed that the waiter did not ask how I wanted the burger done and the burger came out well. (Though still good, I prefer medium rare)."}
{"text":"Good burgers (not just beef burgers either) with nice other options.  I've been to similar places where the portions were so huge, you could not finish anything.  Not like that here.  You receive normal portions that are just enough.  I have a blueberry shake, sweet potato fries, and the lamb burger.  All was really good.  I also tried the chips with blue cheese and buffalo dipping sauce and really liked those as well.

The place has a full bar with a decent selection of micro-brews on tap."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS EVER! My fave is the One Red Door! Truffle fries are also very yummy as are the shakes. I have been many, many times to this location and the ones in Chagrin & Cbus. I highly recommend eating here. Service is always good too!"}
{"text":"The explosion of gourmet burger joints populating NE Ohio in recent years is a welcome addition to the options available in this area. While Michael Symon's B Spot is predictably great and Fairlawn's The Rail surprisingly awful - what to make of Hudson's Flip Side? 

Simply put, this was the greatest hamburger I've ever eaten. I ordered the Forrester which paired a perfectly done medium grass fed hamburger with a variety of mushrooms and truffle aioli. This was umami heaven. My wife had the Flipside burger featuring default applewood bacon, balsamic vinegar, red onions and bbq sauce and again was not disappointed. The triple cooked french fries are astounding in their perfection and somehow even better when dipped in the truffle aioli. 

The service was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. 

We don't get out to Hudson often, but will make a point in the future to visit more often!!!"}
{"text":"Five stars for some of the best burgers I've ever had. Have tried The Forester, One Red Door, and simple cheeseburger. All were excellent. Fries, onion rings, and the tempura asparagus and shiitake mushrooms were all big hits at well.

The Flip Side's only downside is how annoyingly loud it is... so loud that you must raise your voice to be heard at the table. So loud our server couldn't even hear us when ordering.

But the burgers -- so scrumptious."}
{"text":"As noted by other reviews, this is a farly small restaurant, so it would be pretty easy to be faced with a long wait for a table.

Quality meat, toppings and bun.  Excellent execution.  You would have ot look a long time to find a better spot for an excellent burger.  My wife enjoyed the Green Eggs & Ham burger, I had the Forester.  The Forester is loaded with sauteed mushrooms and truffle aoli (on the side).  Great balance of flavor & texture here.  We split the Grana Padano & truffle oil finished fries.  It was all VERY, VERY good.  

I thought that the pricing was reasonable, a good value.

We'll be back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Brought my mom in for a lunch date (we never get to do that)! The gal behind the bar was so nice. She even gave my mom a cup of hot water (she was cold because we were sitting at bar by the door) to warm up. Mom & I both ordered the turkey burger without a bun and split fries. I loved the turkey burger last time I was there and it was amazing. As a matter of fact...the lady to my left saw my burger and asked me how it was and I raved about it so much that she ordered it as well. The presentation of the food was great. The seasoning on the fries was perfect. The burger was even cooked to perfection (Some people over-cook turkey burgers)

The ONLY bad part of the meal was the bones in both my mom's and my turkey burger. My mom didn't even finish hers and I am headed into the dentist today because the moment I chewed the bone I had a sharp pain in my tooth (and it is still there). Not sure why there would have been bone in our turkey burgers. I won't be ordering any burgers the next time I go (If I go back)  

Looks like my $28 lunch date is going to turn into several hundred dollars. :(

5 stars for our server 2 stars for the food. Ouch!"}
{"text":"Got this burger that had short rib on it, whoa buddy! Only down side was it was a little small for the price imo. I didn't get fries but rather the brisket mac and cheese as my side (sold essentially at the price of another meal, not worth it.) I would have thought that combo would be amazing! However, I was disappointed. It was very bland...elbow mac that wasn't that cheesy. The brisket was decent but it couldn't make up for the lack of taste, had it not been so expensive I wouldn't have eaten it. 

I wanted to like this place more than I did. Maybe I have to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and super service!  I had the hot chili pepper burger as asked for it well done....cooked to perfection!  The BBQ/jalapeño fries a must. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I stopped in for drinks and had their signature bloody mary.  It had a smokey spicy flavor and was garnished with a strip of bacon, lime, and 2 olives.  The rest of the drinks are standard martinis with a few twists.  Those were just average at best.

But if beer is your drink, you will be in heaven as they have a huge selection.  

Next time I will try the food--it all looked and smelled good.   The atmosphere was nice too.

But beware, this place is tiny and becomes uncomfortably crowded in no time.  Try going during the off hours or for lunch."}
{"text":"Service was great, burgers were good, onion rings were good, French fries were ok. Cobb salad was good but dressing was just ok. Bloody Mary was horrible, do not order it. Tasted like watered down tomato juice.  Very noisy so not the place for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"I stopped in to Flip Side tonight and am a little disappointed to be giving them such a low rating.  There were some elements that were great. But some just were not.

Pros:
Nice location in Old River

Ability to join the waitlist via Yelp on busy days

Diverse menu-- burgers, mac, sandwiches, pizza, etc.

Unique menu items-- the burgers in particular are superbly unique (some burgers come with toppings like peanut butter, crispy shallots, short rib, and more)

Attentive and friendly server who refilled drinks promptly

I loved the toppings on my One Red door burger and thought it was a unique topping for a burger that tasted delicious.

Cons:
Way overpriced.  My burger was $11 dollars for just the burger.  To add on a side of fries was $4+ dollars more depending on your fry type.  

Food took way too long to come out for an early Friday night when the restaurant wasn't full

Our starter (the kobe beef corn dogs) came out with our meal instead of as a starter (not sure if there was some miscommunication here)

Burger not cooked appropriately.  I asked for medium and it was cooked medium well to well-- no pink at all.

Truffle fries were just so so.  Most of the truffle oil was on the very top few fries.  As you worked your way down, it got less and less flavorful.  Most of my truffle fries were also not a complete fry and just a one inch end piece, like i had been given the bottom of the bag or something.

Bun on my burger was not good. It was a basic sesame seed bun in which the sesame seeds were a little burnt.  Additionally, for such a gourmet and unique burger, the bun just seemed too traditional and didn't quite match the rest of the burger.  I feel like something like ciabatta bread, etc. would have been a better fit.

It is super loud in this restaurant, so not a great place for a conversation.

I may stop in again and give them another try because their burger fix-ins were so delicious.  I had my eye on the short-rib burger but the One Red Door burger won out.  However, it definitely won't be high on my list to revisit."}
{"text":"For the most part of our experience the food was very good, better than the owners other two restaurants which are steps away. Best burger that I have had in a long time. Usually crowded and no call ahead here. Waiter was extremely forgetful and somewhat clumsy, ten percent for Him was an overkill. We will be back, that is if we can get in, Oh, one more thing, the alcoholic drinks are way, over priced !"}
{"text":"Can't beat grass fed beef. I had the forester burger. I'm not one to order a burger when I go out but this was the best burger I've had in a long time. Will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I did not eat here.

I came here as a member of an organized bar crawl in which this business agreed to take part. We each bought a drink (which are middle-of-the road prices. There are other bars in the Flats that have better deals) and were standing around talking when a server asked us to leave because we were \"too loud\" (hello - it's a bar crawl. You just had a surge of 25 people inside, so yes, it's going to be louder than it was). The manager didn't even have the gall to ask us him/herself!  S/he sent a server to ask us to leave. There is no love lost on that server,  but the manager needs to grow a backbone - that is quite literally what you're paid to do. The experience left me questioning if this establishment knows how to run a business and if they would be willing to right any wrongs when a mistake is made on their part (re: a food or beverage order). But really, their first mistake was agreeing to be a stop on a bar crawl when they don't want people inside. 

You can't have the business without hosting customers. I'm very disappointed in the practices of this business."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and happily I was surrounded by drinkers of wine, beer and scotch. Everyone was merry and eventually got around to ordering food. Mostly office space types drinking on a holiday season Friday afternoon. Holidays are my favorite time for visiting pubs by myself. Everyone's in a good mood and chatty. 

The beer selection was solid with an interesting selection of beers on tap. Lots of canned beers too. Nothing cheap. I settled on Holly Jolly by Fathead's. Flavorful festive beer. 

Food. I ordered the Flip Side burger. Very good meat, delicious and with a perfect amount of fat. Not too big either, which is fine. Perfect for lunch. Toppings were very flavorful including a generous amount of bacon. I will say that my burger was cooked medium, and I had asked for medium rare. Normally a mortal sin. Given the great flavor and festive holiday mood, I let it pass. Next time? Things would be different. 

Nice place in a suburban shopping haven of Hudson. Service was excellent. Busy, but experienced bartender who kept a close eye out and even cycled people at the door. 

Recommended if in the area."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Good beer selection and friendly staff.  If you are a burger fan, I highly recommend checking this place out.  All locally sourced beef. And I appreciated the recyclable take-home containers!"}
{"text":"Flip Side has great burgers - they're always great, fresh, grass feed beef cooked to my liking each time.  You could come and order that for lunch and be fine.

The fries are OK - I prefer standard fries w/ salt and could do without the herbs.  Onion Rings are also ok.

Wanted to touch on a couple of points seen on other reviews.  Yes, the inside is small and seating is tight.  And there's usually a line, particularly during dinner.  But I don't know why that's a negative....you're basically saying the place is always packed, so people obviously like it.  And if it's always really busy, then you can charge what you want, be it for burgers or beer.  Basic economics."}
{"text":"Ahhh, seems like an age old debate: B-Spot or Flip Side?

Tough decision, I'll tell ya. . .

But after coming here (among *other* burger joints) throughout the years, it seems like Flip Side has definitely pulled ahead in Cleveland's Burger Competition. Gradually upp-ing their game in the best way possible.

Yes, the sides are à la carte - but, I enjoy choosing gourmet chips, french fries, onion rings with an option of a variety of toppings. . .also, did I mention the tempura shitake mushrooms and asparagus appetizer? An indulgent necessity!

Love that there are craft beer draft/bottle selections a plenty - but, if you're a bloody mary lover like myself, do not pass up the BACON-VODKA INFUSED BLOODY MARY. Really, truly, amazing.

Onto the burgers - the most important part, right? I suggest Shawn's Burger or the Chili Pepper Burger, as both undoubtedly reign supreme. Also, if you're a health nut or into veggie burgers like I occasionally am, the Inverted Veggie Burger is excellent.

The atmosphere is best described as casual, with an industrial and modern touch. Expect crowds, so I highly recommend stopping by on an off-peak hour and sitting at the bar if your schedule allows. 

Sit back and enjoy with friends and/or your significant other - Flip Side is an ideal setting to unwind over some delicious food and drink."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of nine on a Thursday. They don't accept reservations, but if you have a large group then you're allowed to call ahead 30 minutes and they will start to think about where to put you. Downside is that even if they have a table ready for you, you're not allowed to be seated until your entire party is there. This is kind of a bad business practice as one in our group had a cast on her foot and was forced to stand in the doorway dodging other patrons until they caved and let us sit down at our table with six of our party there. To be fair to the few that were late, the parking get's filled up fast in the Old River Shopping area and you'll have to circle around a couple times or do like I did and park down the road and walk a little ways to the restaurant. 

For the food I got the July burger of the month, I think it was called 3 pigs or something? It had pulled pork, pork belly, ? and coleslaw on it. Although the burger patty seemed a little plain and lacked seasoning, overall the sandwich was good and big enough to share. The burgers are priced at $7.50 for plain and up to $16 for a bison burger with most burgers falling around the $10 mark. The burgers don't come with anything so you'll be set back an additional $4.50-$6.50 for a side of fries or onion rings, but the portions are enough for two. I opted for the sweet potato fries with a horseradish mustard sauce and they were pretty tasty. My dining companions all seemed to enjoy the various burgers they got and we passed around the sides. The onion rings are huge, but I didn't really care for them, they seemed bland. The chili cheese fries were tasty. The truffle fries were okay, but a little too herby and oily for me. Our waitress was pleasant and informative (even showed me a picture of the July burger special on her phone) and I liked the décor (they have those garage door windows that can be pulled up in the summer), only thing is it is really loud in there and it was hard to hear the people at my table talking.

I've been back for the one red door burger and the mac & cheese with BBQ brisket. The mac & cheese came in at $9.50 and looks a little plain and like it is lacking sauce but don't be fooled, I found it to be pretty good. Again with the burger I wasn't that impressed with the meat, but it was good overall. My sweet potato fries were a little well done and salty, but I ate them. 

Overall I'd say FlipSide is on the same level as The Rail, Heck's, Jammy Buggars or B-Spot. They all serve a \"higher-end\" version of the burger with alcohol in the milkshakes and aioli dipping sauces. I'd hit up this place again. Also, the Old River Shopping area is a nice spot to take a stroll after your meal and maybe even get some gelato at Rosso's."}
{"text":"My turkey burger was not good. I took a few bites and noticed it was too pink.  Waitstaff didn't even ask why I didn't eat it."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!! Amazing food, great environment... I love this place. Imported beers are on point. Keep it up FlipSide!!"}
{"text":"I think this was my first local place to \"bookmark\" on Yelp!  I am so glad I read a review & put it on my list!

Went there with my boyfriend & son on a Saturday afternoon, 12:30, actually.  We took the last table- right away we knew it was meant to be!  Others behind us had a long wait, but none of them seemed to care- they waited outside and it was 35 degrees! 

I nuzzled into my chair, enjoying the bitchin' chairs!  The interiors were fabulous!  It is very warm & welcoming. I love the tables, chairs, graphics, etc. & the menu is so damn cool!  The space itself is small, but well designed!  I posted a picture of the bathroom because I liked it so much!

We ordered the mac & cheese with brisket for the three of us to share- O M G!  This stuff was the real thing!  Seriously, wow!  Almost drooling thinking about it!  We also shared some truffle fries, which were fantastic!

Boyfriend & I split the Mikey burger- so freaking good!  My son had the Flipside and loved every bite.

Our service was outstanding.  I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Had the California Turkey Burger. They are usually bland and dry but no here at Flip Side. The turkey burger was just as good as a regular burger if not better. I will come here again."}
{"text":"The service was alright, didn't come by asking if we needed anything once we got our food. Plus, a couple next to us came in around 10-15mins after us and ordered burgers...and they got there food before we even got our fries and onion rings. Hmmm....

Then we got bloody Mary's before hand and they were not what we expected. They to me tasted watery and could have had more tomato juice mix. 

I will say that the onion rings and the fries were good though and that's why I am giving them three stars. The kitchen is at least doing there jobs right!"}
{"text":"Good food and service, but overpriced. My server was very nice and I was seated quickly. It's a nice atmosphere. And the bathrooms are fancy. 

The inverted veggie burger is great, and tastes like they make it in-house. Know going in that it's about the size of a slider, so great for the dieters in your life, but not the hungry vegetarian companions. $10 is a little much for a veggie slider. 

Their fries were solid, nothing notable. Huge portion, and appropriately priced. Lots of options.

Finally, I don't think I've ever paid $3 for a glass of iced tea in a restaurant in my life. This isn't some gourmet iced tea. It's bagged. And it's cheaper at Starbucks. What?

I'll come here again, and just get water. :)"}
{"text":"Loved the chili pepper burger and side of mushroom gravy on fries. The only downfall is it is ALWAYS crowded and the beers are pricey. Service was outstanding and food was terrific. I WILL be going back!"}
{"text":"I love this place sooo much. Burgers are phenomenal service is good. The food taste like it was made with love.  I will def be goin back serval times a week!!  also the chefs are sexy"}
{"text":"OMG, must visit. Totally amazing food and service. Been to dozens of similar places but this place left me speechless. Food was so delicious. Came with 4 friends and all feel the same.Kudos to the servers and chefs."}
{"text":"First with the good. Was able to get seated at the bar quickly despite the woman trying to reserve seats for her friends who weren't there and then telling us we were welcome to stand behind her and order drinks. The bartender, Zach, was great. Gave lots of good info and was quick to answer questions. The food was awesome!! We started with onion rings which were delicious. I got Shawn's Burger and my girlfriend ordered green eggs and ham burger. Both were cooked just right and tasted fabulous. We both walked away very satisfied and happy with the food. 
OK....so why not 5 stars then? They were dropped a star because of the manager and the chef. My girlfriend has a serious shellfish allergy. She develops anaphylaxis and has an epi pen ready just in case. Even food prepared in the same area as shellfish can trigger it. She always very politely asks the staff about any shellfish on the menu and asks that her meal be prepared separate from anything and with clean utensils. First, the chef told us they don't have shellfish on the menu. Ummmm......I see crab cakes sir. Second, the manager came over and told us in a condescending tone that its OK because the crab doesn't come in the shell. C'mon people! We got it worked out in the end and I hope this served to educate those two, especially for something this serious."}
{"text":"Delightful gourmet burger restaurant.   Stay away from the veggie burger.  I want to say that right out.  I loved the burgers from previous visits and wanted to try something different, so I tried the chickpea veggie burger.  It is not good.  It's just some avocado and sprouts inside a \"bun\" of chickpea patties.  I like a good bean burger; this was not so good. 
But now that I've gotten that out of the way: this place is great.  The burgers are heavenly.  The fries are excellent and the craft beer selection is first rate.   I've eaten  the Flipside Burger  and it was the best burger I ever had.  I've tried the other places like B Spot and the Rail.  But Flipside is the place to go for the best burger."}
{"text":"I had an impromptu visit at Flip Side for lunch a couple weeks ago and ended up being pleasantly surprised. It was St. Patty's Day, my dad and I had traveled out in that direction to do some rock climbing at Kendall Cliffs but it was packed, so we made a detour until the crowds thinned out. I wasn't thrilled to be going to a pub before climbing, but in the end I was glad to have experienced it.

They had a nice selection of brews, it was crowded in light of the big drinking day and most people were just drinking green beer, but they had quite a few craft selections available on tap. Our waitress was friendly and service was prompt. The scenery was unique in its own way, particularly the bookshelf that decorated the wall opposite the bar. I appreciate anything that promotes reading a good, old fashioned book these days.

Naturally, what ended up making it all worthwhile was the food. I tried the namesake (Flipside) burger, a pretty standard concoction, but the beef was exceptionally tasteful and apparently comes from Ohio-raised, grass-fed cattle. It was perfectly cooked too, which always gains big points from me - I'm always judging whether steaks and burgers are over or under cooked.

Glad I had the opportunity to spontaneously experience this place and will be considering future planned excursions when possible. Keep it real, Flip Side!"}
{"text":"Just the most awesome burgers and fries.! Great décor, and friendly staff.  If you are contemplating stopping here, do yourself a YUGE favor and stop. You will not be disappointed. You may have to wait, and food takes a little while, but it's truly worth it!"}
{"text":"Well, if burgers are gonna be your thing you should probably do a better job at it. 

Ordered the forester burger and a side of truffle fries. Fries were fine, crispy, hot and lots of them.

The burger on the other hand...small greasy as hell patty on a basic giant eagle seasame bun with some \"grilled mushrooms\" that were over cooked and basically reheated. The sautéed onion was mushy and like something you would get at a ballpark. No condiments except for aoli with horseradish in it which we all know is just whipped mayo. Soggy single piece of lettuce, 2 pickles and a average Tomato slice. All that for $13? Skip it and hit five guys instead. At least it's relatively fresh and predictable for a good price."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a high end burger. A little pricey but worth it be extra. My favorite is the red door burger (can't remember the exact name)."}
{"text":"You'll never have a hard time having fun or getting a great meal here. Food is consistently fantastic and service is outstanding, especially Kailie. Never had a bad meal and visit several times a month. Best burger around."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good but this place is very poorly managed and the wait staff has been C+ or below from the time they opened. If you complain about anything, the manager will politely thank you for your feedback and that's about it.  Also don't count on any of your utensils,plates or glasses being clean.  Best bet in Rocky River for great food, diverse menu and great service is Ricky river brewing company. Also burnt wood tavern does a nice job in a great setting."}
{"text":"Best burger of my life! Tried the pepper burger and it was perfect...fries are amazing as well as beer and staff! Def a must wait and try!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here for our first date night away from our newborn.  It's definitely worth it. Great burgers with lots of options.  The fries were amazing and my most favorite thing was getting a milkshake!  Chunks of apple pie within a shake!  Oh my!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow. I do not have one complaint about this place. Every employee had a smile on their face, and willing and happy to serve! The atmosphere was perfect! Well decorated,tasteful music at a reasonable level! You could music and conversation! And and still catch March madness! My burger was literally the best burger I've ever had! It was a corned beef special with cabbage and horseradish mayo! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This was a big $16 disappointment. Arrived at 11:30 am today (Sunday), door was locked. Finally a guy unlocked the door, no smile or greeting for the 3 people waiting. I was alone, 2nd table seated. As more people came in, they all got waited on, but not me. After 15 minutes, I was finally able to get someone's attention to ask if I had a waiter. That guy took my order, then my real waiter, John (only know his name because it was printed on the bill), stopped by and apologized, saying he thought since there were two menus on my table I was waiting for someone. Gosh, guess he couldn't waste his time just asking me. Anyway, someone else delivered the burger & fries, then John was good about checking back but was not at all friendly, probably because he could tell I was angry. The food itself was just ok. When the bill comes to $16 for something as simple as a Simplicity Burger, plain fries, and a Coke, the food should knock your socks off. There wasn't anything wrong with it except the sesame bun was not fresh, but I was expecting an exceptional burger but got nothing remarkable instead. Every single employee appeared to be stand-offish and unhappy. I only saw one smile the whole time I was there. If this were anywhere but First & Main, I doubt they could get away with the prices. No plans to return to this tiny, unfriendly place."}
{"text":"Really \"flipping\" (wocka wocka) back and forth from 3 to 4 star.  Never quite sure whether to compare places like this to burger joints or gourmet burger joints.  The meat was very good, and the variety of toppings excellent.  Not the best gourmet burger I have had, but it's not bad.  It is defiantly above average for burger joints.  The beer selection is very good with a splattering of seasonal.  The main negative of Flipside is the seating.  Not a lot of it, and cramped.
So a 3 on gourmet burgers, 4 on regular burgers, and a 2 on seating.  Beer being the ultimate tie break... 4 star it is."}
{"text":"Top rated burger. Many to choose from. 
Not a huge burger (7 oz), but the taste was amazing 
Will be back. 
Service was great as well.  Nice little spot"}
{"text":"Ok. So the last time we were here, 2 years and 3 months ago, it was the last straw for us.  Today we decided to give them another shot.  Happy to say today's experience was good.  We didn't get burgers, instead we opted for a fried chicken sandwich and the chicken Cobb salad (which I asked if they could blacken the chicken, they can't because they don't have Cajun seasoning, but I did get a peppercorn seasoning added).  Both were very good.  Service was good.  Still hard to figure who to give your name to cause they are never standing by the group of people waiting.  

Ps. The chicken on the salad is good.  A lot of places have those dark charred marks that actually makes the chicken taste burnt. I HATE that!  But here there are NO dark marks!! Yay!!! Chicken is perfect"}
{"text":"Stopped here late on a Thursday night for dinner with a few friends. Ordered a house salad and burger (medium temperature) topped with pickled veggies and a side of truffle and herb fries. 

The ingredients were fresh and well prepared. The salad had just the right amount of dressing tossed in. Burger was done well - juicy and had a slight crisp from a good sear. Fries were crispy and well seasoned. I didn't care much for the curried ketchup served on the side. 

My friend ordered a chicken sandwich but it wasn't cooked through. The rest of the food was good enough that she didn't seem to care too much."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice in the past couple of weeks. AMAZING. I could never be a vegetarian, soley for the purpose of loving a good/great burger. 
So many choices. (I love condiments AND choices!) The onion rings are BIG, FRESH and FABULOUS! Did I mention BIG?! They are crispy and come with a yummy dipping sauce. 
TRUFFLE fries = HEAVENLY. 3 words. synonymous when talking about these fries. 
They are deep fried I believe 3 times? I could be wrong.......but they come with a truffle aioli and then some parmesan shaved cheese and I am assuming truffle oil with other salt and herbs. Seriously hands down amazing! 
First time, I tried a specialty burger and darn it, I cant remember the name now....maybe the forrester??? however, it was delish! Second time. just a basic cheese burger. yep. but it was sooo good. cooked perfect! tasted GREAT! the burgers are BIG. you can easily share one if you don't have your monster appetite on. 
Earlier I mentioned, I am queen of condiments. Like I LOVE condiments. I love options of condiments. The ranch dressing was home made and sooo good. like so good you want to bathe in it. ok. maybe not. it is pretty damn good tho. 
the first time we went, it was a Saturday afternoon. no wait. Second time, was a Friday night and we waited about 20 minutes. bar was packed so there is not a big area for waiting which could be a downfall if really busy. here nor there, not a big issue this particularly night. 
check them out when youre craving a big burger. I don't think you will be sad. I am dreaming of those fries right now.........#justsayin."}
{"text":"Shawn's Burger (grass fed beef, fried egg, lettuce, tomato, griddled onions and bacon on the side), cooked medium. Delicious. The truffle fries were also delicious. If you have the hunger for meat and potatoes, eating at this place is a no-brainer. Clean, good service, great burgers and fries."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely be back. The food was delicious, burgers were juicy and not over cooked. Reasonably priced. The plain fries were tasty with their salt and herbs, seasoned just right. After seeing an order of onion rings go past, it will be on the list for the next trip, they looked exquisite.

The only thing to improve upon was our waitress was also the bartender. She had two tables and was tending bar so we waited a little bit to order and again when we were ready to receive our bill. But food was delivered on time and drinks were never empty. Overall a good first experience!"}
{"text":"I was very very excited for this location to open, because I had the Red Door burger several years ago out at the east side location and it blew my mind. It's in a fabulous location, and I've been twice now for dinner. 

The first thing I have to comment on is the smell. Did anyone else get a whiff of weirdness? They use truffle oil in some stuff, so maybe it's just that but it was just really throwing me off. Thankfully our second visit they had the doors open and I didn't notice it as much.

Anyway, the beer list has a fairly decent lineup of craft beers. I personally think they should have more Ohio beers represented -- this isn't a chain burger place, why not give your home town/state a little bit more love? What caused me more distress was that neither one of our waiters seemed very familiar with the beer offerings. The second time we were there I ordered an IPA that they ended up being out of. Our waiter offered me samples of two other IPAs to try (without me asking, so thumbs up for that) BUT I'm not convinced he actually knew what they were. I hadn't heard of either of the breweries he mentioned...tried to look them up and came up with nothing.  I still enjoyed my beer, but I like to know what I'm drinking...

Food: you won't find juicier burgers around CLE than at this place. I'm not knocking B-Spot or Jammy Buggers or The Rail; I'm a fan of all of these places. But damn...be prepared for some oozing with these bad boys! That's a good thing! For me, the One Red Door is absolute burger perfection. They don't skimp on the brie, and the date/bacon aioli is a combination of two of my absolute favorite things ever. We've had the sweet potato fries, and they were fine, but the onion rings are the way to go. The buttermilk batter is reminiscent of tempura batter, so it's light and crunchy and somehow the onions don't get all slimy. Definitely an elevated little basket of fried goodness."}
{"text":"Made a pit stop here on our cross country drive. Out of all the greatly reviewed places on yelp that we chose to stop en route to the east coast from Minnesota, this was easily the best meal. If I was a local, this would definitely be my hangout spot. 

Lots of great beers on tap and in bottles. I got the pepper burger medium rare, and it actually came out medium rare, what a novel concept. It came with a great spicy ketchup that is house made. All around deliciousness."}
{"text":"Recently visited here for lunch around 1 in the afternoon.  I was pleasantly surprised to walk right in and  get a table immediately.  I can see of the weekends how this place can become very crowded due to lack of space.   I ordered the chicken sandwich and my wife ordered a turkey burger.  Both meals were very good and our service was good as well.  Expect to spend at least $40.00 including tip for lunch for two."}
{"text":"The food was ok. I had the bison burger which wasn't great. It needed more flavor. The portobello on it was soaked in vinegar. Someone in my party had the crab cake and it was too salty. The margaritas were too sour and were more like drinking straight lime juice. It was disappointing especially since it was my birthday. The customer service was on point but the food and drink were not. I wanted this place to be awesome. Hopefully they work out the kinks."}
{"text":"It's usually best to order items a restaurant is \"known for\".  That being said, I wasn't in the mood for a burger. Unfortunately, the tempura asparagus and mushroom appetizer I ordered was super duper greasy, and the dipping sauce tasted like fish sauce. The mac and cheese tasted like béchamel (a lot of nutmeg flavor, although the server argued that there was none in it... whatever). Either way, it had zero cheese flavor- all béchamel, not that béchamel is terrible, it's just not the predominant flavor I want on macaroni and cheese, especially when it's bathed in it, and not baked. Not a place I will go back to. I did meet a nice lady and her gentleman friend though..."}
{"text":"environment: open area. nice and relaxing.

staff: nice and friendly

price: average

food: pretty good

i ordered the chicken sandwich ($8.59) which i found to be very good. only think i didnt like was how little lettuce that gave me and how i thought the mayo was mac and cheese so i didnt put it on my sandwich -_-. the mayo was my fault but i wish i figured it out sooner because i would have loved to try the delicious burger with mayo. the chicken was cooked perfect but i will admit, i was not full off the sandwich alone.

i would recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"When you first walk into this establishment, do not expect to be greeted. The \"hostess\" will eventually emerge from the back and sign you in on a tablet. You will get a text when your table is ready. Cannot comment on the food. We never got seated. We were told 20-30 minutes. At 45 min we left. Got a text 15 min later to say we were \"on deck\". Place only has 8 tables and seating at the bar. Don't expect to get seated with any party over 4. Not likely to return. Snobish attitude all around."}
{"text":"good location, cool space, good fit for the neighborhood. 

excellent burgers and onion rings. Six of us, all enjoyed our orders. I had the Shawn burger, yumm. Server Jeremy was perfect, professional and fun. 

Not a fan of the noise level... or the glaring work lights coming from the exposed kitchen into the dinning space... it was harsh and killed the ambiance of the room. Could be improved. Def will go back again."}
{"text":"Was excited to check this place out. Service was very slow for a Tuesday night around 8:00. (Place had 4-6 tables with people in them) waited 10mins for anyone to come over and took our drink orders. O rings were average at best. Burgers had very little flavor, I got the smokey BBQ burger and the brisket was good but burger was just ok and cooked well done when I asked for medium) Food came out really quick, it didn't seem very hot or fresh. Will I go back? If I'm in the neighborhood I would think about it, but I wouldn't make a special trip. B spot is still the king...by far."}
{"text":"Great burger, only thing that was a downside was the price. 10 bucks for a burger without fries or a drink. 4 dollars for a beer.  great taste made up for it."}
{"text":"Not bad, Bacon Aioli was a little greasy.  Service was great, ambiance was also great."}
{"text":"Love going to this place but not when it's too crowded. Plan ahead and beat the crowds to really enjoy this place. Fun atmosphere, delicious food too. My favorite is the Brisket Burger with smoked gouda cheese.....oh my goodness, it is delicious!  They have fantastic made from scratch margaritas too!  Only reason I did not give them 5 stars is sometimes it is so loud in this place it becomes difficult to have a conversation with the people your dining with! We only go here once in a while because for a burger joint it is a little pricey- but we have never been disappointed with the service or the food!"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked cheeseburger. The hand cut fries were delicious. Clean. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but unfortunately have had sub par service almost every time Ive gone. I go back because the burgers are truly great. The one time in particular I was told there was a wait time of 30 minutes for 6 guests. As we watched others be seated, and 35 minutes later, asked if our table would be up soon. She said maybe another 20 minutes as the only large table in the place was filled. Again 25 minutes later, we were starving and she gave me attitude when I asked why we had not been seated, like I should know better then to bring in a party of 6 guests. Ridiculous, so we left. It is worth it for 2-4 people on a night/time you are sure it will not be busy, not worth it for anything else."}
{"text":"Very good burgers but asked for well done, got medium.  The flavor of burger is good but not out of this world. Got the black and blue, the cheese was good, but there were black slimy things on it as well, you can laugh I ate them because I am food challenged,  but I am still wondering what they were.....caramelized onions or peppers, I really do not know. If you like a small trendy bar with craft beers and fancy drinks or alcohol infused milk shakes, then this is for you.  The table service was prompt and attentive for such a cramped place. The brioche bun had sesame seeds (not everyone can), the fries and sides are all separate which adds up if you want to watch budget.  Two people with fountain beverage looking at @$40 plus tip, if you each get plate of fries or onion rings,with your burger---salads are good, had the ranch greens but another additional cost.  As for the truffle fries,  tried them and they were ok, but really dry.  I guess you have to be a big fan to get all worked up over them.  
For me, good place if I'm in the area and in need of a burger and brew. It's a small, narrow and dark bar.  Maybe they should buy out the boutiques next door and make larger or some kind of outdoor seating?  Five Guys burgers and fries are still tops with me, as long as you don't need alcohol with your meal."}
{"text":"I visited Flip Side for the first time last weekend, & the food was PHENOMENAL. But first, the wait:

The wait was pretty long - nearly an hour & a half in a teeny, tiny, almost-nonexistent waiting area. It was only estimated at 45 minutes, so we started to get pretty cranky, & we listened as would-be diners around us complained to the server that their wait had been grossly underestimated, as well. When tables opened up, I was frustrated to see that the waitstaff did not seat people immediately or even quickly. How can you expect to make it through a long line of people waiting if you don't seat them when tables are ready?! The hostess, a young girl who seemed beyond frazzled, seemed frustrated that no one wanted to sit at the bar, but the seating area there is not conducive to conversation if you're eating with more than one other person, so we continued to wait. When the wait finally died down & we were next in line, the hostess came over to apologize to us & to explain that she'd miscalculated the wait times & was waiting on a few tables to leave. We appreciated the explanation, but the way it all went down was a little unprofessional. A seasoned hostess could've helped sort it out much better & much friendlier. 

Fortunately, the food soothed most of our waiting wounds. The server came over quickly to apologize for our long wait in being seated, & the hostess checked in with us to be sure we were being well taken care of, which I appreciated. My two friends & I split an order of mini corndogs, which I absolutely devoured. We also ordered milkshakes, a Medjool date milkshake with vanilla ice cream & bacon vodka for me. Sounds gross, I know, but it was the best milkshake I've ever had! I had a chicken sandwich, added aged cheddar cheese (great choice!) & a side of fries. The fries were no great shakes, as they reminded me of Wendy's, but I really like the sriracha mayo I asked to dip them in. 

Even if you don't like burgers (like me), Flip Side is worth a try - the chicken sandwich was great, the ambiance is fun, the milkshake was divine. Just be prepared for a wait!"}
{"text":"One red door burger is the best!!! Heart of Hudson with easy access ... a little small, but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but the service is terrible. I'm not sure if it was the time of day we were there, but get it together!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The food was definitely 5 stars in my book. I had the Ahi tuna burger and it was amazingggg!!!! The tuna was so fresh it tasted like it was caught that same day. We also ordered their seasoned fries which were really good too. I was kind of disappointed that they didn't serve fries with our burgers but it wasn't a big deal.

We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the Cavs game. They have a lot of flat screen TV's behind the bar. The place was packed but the service was still wonderful. Our bartender was checking on us and giving us refills when our beers got low. I can't wait to come back again. The décor is very clean and nice and they did a great job on the design. An added bonus - the bathrooms were huge! They also have a great selection of drinks and I enjoyed their local IPA on draft. Definitely worth checking out and trying the food! Looking forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"I kind of expected this to be one of those hype victims. Turns out, it is. At some point, a burger was created. Somehow, the media latched onto it and gave it some vicious chews with their scummy teeth. Now Flip Side has a reputation to stand up to. Turns out, they do a decent job of it. 

I had to try the Curry Lamb Burger because when was the last time I'd heard the words curry, lamb and burger in the same sentence? I'd say the Medieval times but I wasn't quite born then. I was informed that it had curry yogurt sauce and cucumber mint slaw so I was expecting something exploding with an intense mixture of flavors. Not so, really. It was good but the other burgers I saw looked better. So I gorged myself on sweet potato fries. Which were good enough to kill a Viking. 

The fact that this is one of those places that the cool kids go to is the biggest small reason I didn't like it quite as well as I could have. And yet I'm a fan and I don't plan on flipping sides any time soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chili Pepper Burger and a nitro milk stout to go with it.  Both were excellent.  The options for burgers are quite interesting and they have plenty of different beers on tap and bottles as well as wine.  Service was very friendly and the establishment has a nice antiquated feel."}
{"text":"Flip side has long been on my \"to try\" list. I mean I love a good burger and I was about to embark on a month of veganism so naturally I needed a good shebang to end on and local grass fed beef is up my alley. 

I ordered the make a wish burger because I enjoy charity and spicy Tex mex inspired food. At $13 with no fries I was hoping for better. My bun was disintegrating in grease and the burger was extremely salty. Like liking my Himalayan pink salt lamp (yeah I wanted to know if they were made with real salt.... they are) salty. 

After realizing they didn't come with friends my friend added on a side which never came except for on the check. They did take them off after we asked but still. We had some sort of weird deal where we had two servers? One was somewhat attentive and the other not so much. 

It's okay- I would come back if someone suggested it but let's just say I wouldn't be the one suggesting it."}
{"text":"Best burger place I've ever been to

Everybody draws the comparison to B-Spot, which is fair - however, though B-Spot  is very good, you get a smaller burger for the same price as Flip Side - and it doesn't taste nearly as good. Definitely stick with Flip Side"}
{"text":"Well messed our whole order up! Totally! And then we got a hair in our burger... Horrible experience and this place s always packed.   This was just a really a bad experience.  But really there burgers are great.  After the second time and they just cleaned off the topping on my burger and gave it back to me, but whatever!   My wife had the hair burger!  Ha!  Oh and seasonal punkin milk shake was phenomenal!   I'm a rootbeer fool there's is ok. Sprechers is the brand."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and I didn't get food and just went to the bar for a couple drinks, and I'm personally not a beer person, but if you are looking for a good beer in tap and you don't like beer, their raspberry ale on tap was to die for!!! Would recommend!!!! The bar tender there was really nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"My best friend was raving about this place. As she should it was amazing! 

The bun was soft, burger was cooked perfectly, service was great, ambiance was very peaceful. 

Highly recommend, be prepared to spend some money on a burger and fries. Buttttt their selection of specialty burgers and their portion of fries that are totally shareable makes it worth it."}
{"text":"I'd Flip for Flip Side

Trying to think why I'm not immediately giving it a five. I would say it was the service. It wasn't heinous, but it was a bit inattentive and insincere (host was sorta snooty). 

Food? 10. I had the spicy burger - it was delish! Cooked just right, thick but bite-able (I like a big burger, but not when you can't even bite into it). The spiciness gave a good kick without making it too hot to handle. 

Our table shared onion rings and sweet potato fries. Each was served with a special sauce and both were delicious. The onion rings were nice and crispy and even the crunchy part was flavorful. And the SP fries were also well done - crispy and flavorful. 

I would go again for sure!"}
{"text":"First time at flip side I've lived in hudson for 13 years wasn't impressed . Horrible cocktails to strong no wonder at 1pm on week day there were so many men in the restaurant . The staff took the drink of my bill which was very understanding. I tried 2 other cocktails that was with me and they also way to strong and to much sour mix . 
The food was good but I also on the expensive side . 
Most likely won't return the place is more of a gentleman's restaurant not for family in my book . Liked the decor and staff was friendly ."}
{"text":"The Flip Side in Hudson is a great place to hang out at the bar, watch some sports, talk to a really friendly bartender and have a burger... except for the burger.  If this wasn't a \"burger joint\" the burger would be fine, but it is a burger joint and the burgers are mediocre.  

The actual meat is good, there isn't enough of it for the price.  This is a standard, flat burger you can get anywhere, and the last two times I was there I was so disappointed.  I didn't even get a full slice of tomato both times and I received one miniscule piece of wilted iceberg lettuce as my garnish.  It's a shame I love the atmosphere, but they have become some cheap on their portions and their presentation is so pathetic, that I can only give it two stars.  You get more tomato and lettuce on a Whopper, how sad is that?  

Sweet potato fries and onion rings are great.  I have written to the manager about the lousy presentation but have received no reply.  Went back last week to see if anything changed, nope, sad to say.  There are better burgers in Hudson...The Rosewood, Hudson's and Lager & Vine.  C'mon Flipside spend the extra 2 cents on a nice piece of lettuce and a whole slice of tomato.  You have got a great place, that can be a GREAT burger joint, not just a medicore BURGER joint."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. So good!! I had to be a plain Jane and get the say cheese burger and it was incredible! I added avocado to it and it was the best seasoned and cooked burger I have ever had. We had the chili cheese fries to share and they were different but so freaking good. 

To top off our meal, we ordered a chocolate milkshake and they split it between my husband and I without us asking. One of the best milkshakes I've ever had, and that's the truth. I cannot wait to go back soon and try something new!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high, but generally if I spend over eight dollars on a burger I want to be wowed at least a bit.
The lady ordered corndogs, which touting to be Kobe beef seemed a bit over the top.
Not bad.
My burger had the bare minimum toppings, and left me disappointed.

The beer was overpriced, and continues to be, on a few occasions for stopping by for a pint.

The staff tends to be lovely, and the fellah named Lars is a gem.
Other than that, it's pretty uninspiring."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Flip Side last night to watch the Kentucky Derby. I had a locally crafted brew, but the mint juleps were flowing pretty steady throughout the crowd. Perfect burger, juicy and pink inside, just as ordered. They even served it up on two plates and cut in half as my husband and I were splitting one.  Nice service Flip Side!  
We sat at the bar and chatted with Chris, the general manager, about the race and Flip Side stuff. They are a little tucked away in Old Detroit/River area but that just makes them more cozy. Plenty of parking nearby, it's the perfect spot to meet up with friends or watch the game. Staff is friendly, professional and well trained. Crowd is mixed and family friendly.   Real cloth napkins, one of my favorite things!  Check them out, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great burger joint off hwy 80 when traveling. The Shawn burger was amazing! If you order fries or onion rings, it can be shared. Huge order!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good the chicken was bad the signs the sausage was bad the signs were bad atmosphere was bad the whole atmosphere was that shit the curtains were bad and the whole and it's actually the store name and my pain is really bad I'm sorry I agree I agree all in all I would give a Chinese place easily replaced better view than this piece of garbage Hudson do better"}
{"text":"The best burgers! The macaroni and cheese is really good.  Also the house made chips are excellent!"}
{"text":"My tuna was so over-cooked that I couldn't break it apart to try to eat it...sent it back only to wait 45 minutes for a margarita pizza which came out cold - it was quite disappointing. We will not return..."}
{"text":"This is our all time favorite burger place. The burgers are delicious and perfectly prepared. The staff is well trained in their selection of beers and they are always very attentive to the customers. My favorite is the Forrester Burger. Be prepared for a long wait if you go during peak dinner hours. But if you have to wait they will simply text you on your cell phone. Use that time to enjoy downtown Hudson."}
{"text":"The food is OK, They have a good beer selection.  I was a bit surprised that the burgers did not come with french fries included."}
{"text":"Great service and recommendations!  Food was amazing!!  Had the toppings for a burger on a chicken breast. Delicious!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!! Delicious!! 

I have serious food allergies: soy, canola and no gluten!! They were able to accommodate me and serve us up some pretty awesome sweet potato and potato fries, fried in good old fashioned lard!! They were the most incredible things I've ever crunched into. No kidding. Unreal!!! 

The burger was delicious, the lettuce was great. You can absolutely tell the difference between grain fed and grass fed. I love that Flipside cares so much about not only doing good farm to table, but doing great farm to table!!! They use 100% certified olive oil in their salad dressings, not sure if most people realize this but just about every restaurant uses a soy or canola blend in their dressings. This is rare and to make sure that it's certified is even more rare!! They seemed to understand about the contamination problems with olive oils from Italy and Greece and went the extra step to make sure that they are using only the best. I'm sorry folks that complain about prices, but if you want to eat at quality restaurant and actually get real organic food and not soy substitutes you have to pay a little extra. The amount they are charging is nominal. I guarantee that you could eat at this restaurant, eliminate all other processed foods from your diet and you'd lose weight! The only reason people are fat is all the food additives. You won't get fat eating real food!!! 

Okay, not sure what anyone is talking about bad service, but we were here during off hours around 2:30 on a Monday. The server and the manager were both sweethearts and incredibly accommodating. Having these allergies has forced me to be aware of and to understand everything that most restaurants are putting in their food. I can tell you, this much, any restaurant that serves food of this quality is packed and you will wait if you go at a busy time. If you don't want to wait and you don't care about quality, check out some of the other restaurants nearby, you can waddle right on in!

Next time I'm in town, I'm hitting the sister restaurant!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in hudson! I always anticipate a wait when I go, but the burgers and sweet potato fries are well worth it! The male bartender makes a great martini and was super personable! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Been there many times but I am done . Burgers are smaller onion rings no zap . No flavor in the burger . Service was great like always . Time to revamp it self . Living on there morals now .  Sorry was one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on the way home from Akron at a friend's recommendation. My burger was good, but that was after I had to send it back. The first one was so rare it verged on being raw. The atmosphere is good and it is clearly very popular. Will try it again."}
{"text":"The best damn turkey burger ever~!  Fries and onion rings are not included in the pricey sandwiches and they are pricey themselves, but I guess that's the price you pay!"}
{"text":"After Michael Symon gave us B Spot I was happy to get another option for a burger place. it is a welcome scene to see Flipside come into the area as a place that is a more eclectic variety of burgers with things like the forester with mushrooms and onions that's different from herbs traditional sautéed mushrooms and onions.

On to the food though, the apps are glorious, they come with things like chili dusted onion rings and other things you only want to eat rarely, but could eat every day given the chance. The burgers are very good and I personally can't put them down when they arrive table side, they are well presented and very unique. 

As far as service, there are plenty of staff to get the job done, some busy days it can get packed and feel a little slow as far as ordering, but you do get good service none the less. The one con is the noise level, it can get quite loud in the restaurant and the surfaces seem to just bounce the sound around.

If you want a good burger I recommend this as one of your top options as far as a gourmet burger experience"}
{"text":"The burgers looked delicious but I went with their hot and spicy chicken sandwich. It had a nice super crunchy coating and flavorful, not too hot flavor. It was really good. Ok next time I will try one of their burgers."}
{"text":"Delicious! A little pricey, but gotta love gourmet cheeseburgers with fun friends ;)"}
{"text":"Forest burger, potato chips and a date shake.  Hubby enjoyed the chili burger and a craft brew. Glad we stopped by"}
{"text":"The burgers were great. Very flavorful and juicy. Youll find a number of different specialty burgers. That's the good. Now for the bad. Small dining room. The light fixture above us has not been dusted in a long time. Burgers average about $10. The French fries are tossed in basil which really gives it a strong basil taste. 

Its a fun one time trip only, but I wont be back."}
{"text":"I tried Flip Side for the first time with my dad last week. I have to say it served one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had, and I'm pretty particular about my veggie burgers.

There was a sunflower festival going on outside, so I was expecting to have to wait a while before being seated. Luckily to my surprise, we were seated right away. Our waitress was super friendly and willing to answer any questions I had. I ordered a blueberry pie shake that had real pieces of blueberries in it with pie crust and vanilla ice cream. It was probably one of the best milkshakes I've ever had! I also ordered the inverted veggie burger on a brioche bun and added cheddar cheese. Just writing this review is making my mouth water because this sandwich was that good, honestly! It ended up being super big, so I recommend coming here on an empty stomach. I also ordered a side of aioli fries because the sandwich didn't come with a side. 

I'm giving Flip Side four stars because the sandwich didn't come with the fries, which I feel like is pretty standard in most burger joints, and because a different waiter brought out my food and ended up spilling the aioli sauce all over my plate and burger and he didn't apologize. Thankfully, my actual waitress saw what happened and brought me over a different plate, which I thought was really nice.

I can see why this restaurant has multiple locations because it was popping inside and outside! I absolutely loved Flip Side, and know that my dad has already been back with my mom."}
{"text":"The Flip Side is now a must have when I am in town! Perfectly cooked, juicy burgers and delicious homemade sweet potato fries, makes my mouth water just thinking about it!
The only downside is the place is small and they don't take reservations. In the evenings the wait can be quite long. I've even had to wait for a lunch table on a Monday. 

Otherwise - a must have in Hudson!"}
{"text":"Nothing less than a five star, wish there was more options! Server, Stephen, hands down out of all the restaurant I go, best server in Cleveland! Everything from the fries to the drinks are perfect! Get in and try everything!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience. The food was well priced and fantastic. The service was out of this world! Very comfortable decor. Definitely the best onion rings I've ever had. Corn dogs......can we say incredible! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a great burger joint--it is literally tied for my 2nd favorite burger place--
The ranking is still as follows
1. M.E.A.T. In Key Largo Florida
2. Is a 2 way tie between THe Daily Grind in Daytona Beach, Florida and Flip
Side 

I had the Mikey --bacon, tomato, lettuce, pepper jack and a spicy remoulade sauce.  The burger was cooked to my liking and everything was delicious.  The fries were much better this time from the last time I had a burger here--the last time they didn't have as much flavor--maybe it depends on the chef/cook you get that night.  Really a good time with family.  The things that differentiates this burger joint from my number ONE are all little minor things but they add up-1. Better bun. --it's a bit dry
Here--it could be the day of week we went.  2. The homemade mango chipotle ketchup (which should be bottled and sold--I would never buy normal ketchup ever again) at MEAT 2. Homemade beer mustard--amazing (drools) 3 homemade root beer on tap (insanity) 4. Micro brews done by the restaurant on tap.  
All things that could help Flip side to improve the experience with customers."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Have lived in Hudson all of my life- and it's about time we had a place as consistent as Flip Side.  Have been there three times- everything was spot on.  Service is excellent- personable but not intrusive.  Burgers and Sides are all wonderful.  Our new favorite go-to restaurant- they do a fantastic job."}
{"text":"Pretty plain food, nothing really stood out to me. If I ever went back I would skip on any of their drinks and just get a burger. There may be some hidden gems on the menu but from what I've experienced it's just OK."}
{"text":"First time in this location! I was taken aback by the lack of crowd on a Friday night because I think the location is neat in Old Rocky River. I had the One Red Door Burger - the melted brie is what sold me, the date/applewood bacon aioli was the pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for burgers on the way up to Michigan.  Definitely a solid place with good food.  I would come back if I could.  Maybe on my next road trip."}
{"text":"I liked going to Flip Side until a couple of recent experiences here. The burgers are great & gourmet, and the sweet potato fries & wedge salad are good sides, but you have to pay extra for them. And the burger prices recently went up, so I don't ever really feel like paying $10-$15 just for a burger which probably costs less than half that to make. I got a shake here once for $7 which was half the size I could've got at Mitchell's & very mediocre. 

I believe the management at least at this location is very poor. One time we had a server who was clearly high and very out of it. Another time we walked in for lunch on a Sunday and it was FREEZING inside, probably under 60 degrees to where I didn't want to take my jacket off. When asking the server, he said they had problems with the heat. Which begs me to ask the question why they would even open their doors for business if they couldn't keep the place at room temp! Ridiculous, but frustrating as I once enjoyed this place but doubt I will ever re-visit."}
{"text":"Great food! My burger was perfectly prepared, juicy,  and delicious. My only complaint is how tight it is in there and that they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"just killing time before a wedding!

The fries were lovely & so was the beer.  The bartender could have been more attentive, but I made due.

Didn't try any of the burgers, but from what I did see they looked good.  The turkey burger was highly recommended by the staff and the patrons."}
{"text":"My lady and I split a burger and salad. Dope burger - favored to perfection & salad was equally mouth watering. 
Love the variety of beverages - fan of the craft beers. Porters and stouts are my go-to once the weather shifts to freezing.

The restaurant is laid out so that conversations don't overlap - aka. you don't have to yell for your friends at the table to hear you.

Glad this place is still thriving and look forward to revisiting next time I'm in Hudson."}
{"text":"I ordered the inverted Veggie Burger to go. I liked everything about it and was truly impressed.
The only thing I would caution folks about is the line and the crowd. It is always busy and on the weekends, you may have to stand in line out the door.  Prepare for the crowd. I ordered take out and had to wade my way through the crowd to get the brown bag to go."}
{"text":"Tried Flip Side for the first time last week and it was pretty tasty. Location is in Old River which is a cute shopping area. We were greeted right away and seated. Happy hours included $2 fries and drink specials. My hubby and I split the chef's choice milkshake which was peanut butter pretzel. It was tasty, but really small given the price. At B Spot, they are at least twice as big. I'm not a huge burger fan, but I tried my husband's French burger with short ribs and garlic aioli and it was delicious. I got a plain chicken sandwich which was good, but basic. The fries were me cent too and really big for $2. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Great food and great beer selection. Get there early, we came on Friday night at 5:30 and had to wait an hour, was packed the whole time we were there. Service a little slow but worth the wait if you are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"People love Flip Side for its great atmosphere, fantastic selection of draft beer, and the quality beef in the burgers. And it's hard to complain about any of that. I'm a bit on the cheap side, however, so buying burger meals ala carte seems a bit like price gouging and with $10 burgers...well...it comes off as a little over the top to me (especially for families). The check for 4 ppl with 2 beers/2 sodas will probably set you back about $75. Nevertheless, it's a great place to take a date or to have a quality meal with people you don't mind spending money on."}
{"text":"I'm a big burger fan. Hell, I'm a big food fan as all my yelp friends know. These burgers are top of the line. I kid you not - best burgers I have had to date. I'm not going to lie I've tried three off the menu and I can't wait to try another one.

 I wish I could tell you my favorite - instead I'll tell you the three I've tried - Turkey Burger (I love sprouts and avocado!). One Red Door Burger (\"The One That Started it All) the bacon/date aioli and brie cheese complete the burger. It changed my outlook on life. Lastly, the Black and Blue which is peppercorn crusted to give it a little something extra. Mac'n'cheese is a delicious blend of cheeses and you should probably get the truffle fries- but they are addictive (don't say I didn't warn you). 

There is something about grass fed beef that makes the juiciness and flavor profile unparalleled. They also have a great craft beer selection, a lot which are from the Cleveland area. I love going into restaurants and seeing pride in the city where they started. Makes me feel good!"}
{"text":"Love love the burgers and waitstaff the bartenders are so awesome! The hostess has a lot to learn! Great place however!!! Welcome to River!"}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed with this place! It was like anticipating an amazing sexual experience with someone only to have it be the worst sex you've ever had. So bad in fact that you are too embarrassed to share it with your best friend.  I've had equal quality food at my local McDonald's and our server( I'll refer to her as Kail for short) counted have been ruder!

My husband ordered  the\" tempura shitake mush & as\" as a starter, although he enjoyed his veggies; the tempura crunches were the only thing I enjoyed about this meal. Our waitress however, apparently didn't think I was worthy of picking off of his plate because she grabbed it while my hands were on it & picked it up & away while I was still eating.  I ordered the truffle fries, they tasted like they were frozen and reheated. You could smell small hints of the truffle oil but tasting it wasn't an option. Even the grated cheese was flavorless. I ended up throwing them out, $6.00 for fries that tasted worse than eating a bag of frozen fries out of the dryer down the drain :( 

I also ordered their mac & cheese with BBQ brisket. The noodles had little to no flavorless cheese on them  and were over powered by the seasoning (possibly oregano or parsley) . Now there's al dente & then there's undercooked; mine were sooo undercooked I might as well have eaten them out of the box . The brisket wasn't any better, it was dry and flavorless as well. You couldn't even taste a small drop of BBQ sauce. I had my husband try it and he agreed that it was bad...possibly due to the large amount of disgusting grease hidden under the noodles. I wanted to send the fries back but our waitress never gave me the opportunity. 
We also split the date shake- just vanilla ice cream & chopped up dates; for $5.50 I expected way more. Again, flavorless!!! It was really lacking & could've used some cinnamon, honey or even some chocolate to give it some wow factor but nope. 

Out waitress on the other hand was easily the worst part of the meal (Kail)! She was inattentive, very obviously annoyed and cut you off before you could say anything. Either by walking away or ignoring you. She often turned her back before you could ask or comment on anything and quickly walk away. I could throw the word unsanitary in there as well to describe this young blond brat. The reason being that I ordered their ginger beer  (the worst I've ever had!) and had it sitting to my side next to the wall. She reached over all of the food without even asking if I was finished with my drink and grabbed it from the mouth of the bottle & was taking it away before she realized it wasn't empty. Thankfully, the majority of it had been poured into a glass that was garnished with none other than an very old wedge of lime. Then Kail brought us our bill and when I opened the little black book it comes it there were two bills- one for us & one for another table that wasn't even hers (Ryan's  was the servers name  on this check). When she went to take it I tried to tell her that another persons bill was in the booklet but she turned her back on me and walked away- never apologizing or saying anything at all. She wasn't worth the generous tip my husband gave her- a complete b**ch! 

Again, have no idea what all the hype was about . If you want amazing truffle fries, Darby's on 59 has the best!!! And their servers aren't spoiled  little girls but polite adults- just saying."}
{"text":"Whoever runs this kitchen needs a lesson in corndog battering and frying. Or maybe just show them what a corndog actually looks like. At this point, it just seems like they're guessing ?"}
{"text":"I heart you M Symon and your infectious laugh to the ends of the world but as Bobby Y. said in his review, BSpot doesn't even come close to Flip Side's burgers. They are simple when they are meant to be \"simple\" but gracefully concocted when they are mixed with other ingredients for different creations. Our waitress also told us what beers on draft would pair best with our burger choices, so I had a pale ale with my chili pepper burger. The burger was medium done just as I had asked and incredibly flavorful. I almost didn't need to add any more of the chili ketchup they gave me on the side. My parents had the Flipside burger and the chicken shady (? sandy???) sandwich and both of them enjoyed their meal very much. I'm also glad we came here early around 5:30 because it was quite busy after we had gotten seated (this was on a Friday night in Hudson). Definitely worth a trip down Route 8 for the CLE-ers."}
{"text":"Holy flippin, this burger place was workin for us.

After driving around the area, we stopped by Flipside for a late lunch. I've never even set foot in Hudson, OH (let alone even knew where it was), but was surprised at how cute and new the downtown area was. Hmm.

Enter Flipside. The art along the walls were sketched with interesting artsy figures- it was definitely cool, new, and hipster-ish. Our waiter seated us right away, clothed in his baseball shirt with \"FS\" for flipside, and began chatting it up with us. He had such a soothing soft voice- and knew everything and anything about the menu...without even hesitating to look down at a menu or anything. I LOVE THAT CHARACTERISTIC. It's how waitstaff should be! I already felt my trust in Flipside building.

To my partner foodie's surprise, there was ginger beer. What??? He exclaimed as I pointed it out.... so down went the beer menu, and he ordered a ginger beer. \"Mmmmmmmm\" was his only response. I assumed it was good. 

We got the triple cooked fries. According to our informative waiter, he stated that the fries were first boiled, then fried, taken out, then fried again. They were hearty fries. yum yum yum.

He got the Green Eggs and Ham burger...oh man, that fried egg on top was perfect and with the basil mayo? mmmm.

I got the Forester Burger- a burger with mushrooms, then slightly deep fried (like tempura!) shittake mushrooms on top with truffle aioli. OMG. Best mushroom + burger EVER. Loved it.

We were stuffed. I must say... I'm not sure who I like better- Flipside or B-spot. I'm leaning toward Flipside though, due to variety of everything. If only it wasn't so far...but man, that's some flippin good stuff."}
{"text":"Took significant other and kid here. Big mistake. This place is NOT FOR KIDS even though Yelp had it listed as such. You can find options for kids (basically the appetizers, I recommend the corn dogs), but there's absolutely no seating for kids. In fact, all the seats and tables are raised, so depending on the child's age they may not be able to sit at the table at all.

That said, the food was tasty from the burgers to the fries to the corn dogs. Prices are a bit high (you are in Hudson though), but otherwise everything about our meals was delicious. Highly recommended burger joint."}
{"text":"Ordered the high priced bison burger MR, burger came out small like a Wendy's Patty and was cooked MW. Ordered a side of fries, got all 1\" stubs.  My son ordered the fried chicken sandwich, it was just okay.  Total bill for all of those 3 items plus 1 coke was $37. Came in during the CAVS game, waiter acted like would rather be somewhere else. Never complained or asked for anything except a refil on my sons coke which he seemed bothered that we asked.  Totally not worth it."}
{"text":"I've been to Flip Side many times since my last review, so no point in repeating my same praise. 

This review is for a to-go order. 

Yup, you can order FS as take out!  Many people complain about how small and difficult it is to get a seat; well a take out order solves all that.  

I was a little apprehensive that ordering a burger take out would result in something nasty by time I got home.  At the advice of my neighbor, I did the following. Place an order over the phone.  Head down to FS ASAP.  Sit your behind at the bar and order a nice IPA.  By time you finish your IPA the food will be ready and you can bring it home piping hot and fresh. 

I got the bag home and my wife and I took it out.  Burgers are wrapped in a nice foil to keep them warm, however wrapping kills presentation so they look squished and not as pretty as at the restaurant. Kinda how Wendy's wraps their burgers. However, taste was spot on.  Damn good as always. 

As a plus, my bill was 1/3 of what it is when I'm there and drinking 2-3 beers.  Saved money to boot!"}
{"text":"I went in by myself for lunch on a Monday afternoon and sat at the bar. The service was top notch! I had the flipside burger and sweet potato fries that were both out of this world! I think this would be a great location to watch a sports event- great prices, huge televisions and great food!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. We tried the original flip side burger and the Mac and cheese with brisket. The burger was was great and prepared perfectly. The Mac and cheese was really good especially with the brisket. 
   The server was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Flip Side burgers are the best!   We usually go to the location in Hudson. The first time we tried the location in Rocky River, they were super accommodating with trying to get us out of there quickly so we could make our movie.   The staff was very helpful and friendly, and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"We LOVE the Flip Sides in the Hudson and Chagrin Falls locations.  It was a destination we would take friends and family who visited.  However, since moving to Lakewood we've frequented the Rocky River location at least 3 times and have been disappointingly underwhelmed every time.

In fact... for whatever reason, most of the burgers we've tried in Lakewood/Rocky River have not impressed.  The only place that makes us want to return for a mouth-watering burger is Five Guys (isn't that sad?!?  the only place!).  Not Jammy Buggars, Not Streat Burger.  Not (so far) Burgers 2 Beer.  Not Flip Side."}
{"text":"Delicious well cooked burger with a very interesting menu - hard to decide because it all sounded and smelled so yummy. The decor is dark and pub like - intimate and not too loud. Will visit again, but don't go at peak times - the wait can be long!"}
{"text":"Previous reviews have summed up the quality here. Server was friendly, food was fantastic. The burgers really are that good."}
{"text":"My family and I are frequent patrons of Flip Side!  Why do we keep coming back?  Because they prepare the BEST BURGERS IN OHIO!!!  Our fave is the Flip Side!  And do order the fries or the onion rings!  Their cole slaw is my favorite of any restaurant!  Actually, we have tried most of their sides and we have not been disappointed!  Also they frequently switch up the menu with seasonal burgers so you won't get bored!  
The place is small and space is tight, and like most burger joints, this is not a place for a quiet, intimate date with your Sweetie!  However, the servers and bartender seem to enjoy their jobs and the food is consistently phenomenal--at least in part because of the quality of the Ohio grass fed beef!
The only problem we have is waiting to be seated, so either try to get there before 5 (4 on holidays) or call ahead to be put on a waiting list."}
{"text":"M- Not a bad burger the seating was tight light on real estate. Like many restaurants seasoning is a issue a little salt goes a long way. They offer organically feeded beef (I didn't realize there was any other kind) Im still looking for those free range chickens on the loose. The burger was prepared on a flat top rather than a grill and some seasoning would bump it up but overall ok."}
{"text":"Forester burger is my favorite.  My husband always gets the Shawns burger with the egg on it.  I also like the spicy burger.  we always get the parm truffle fries, they are uh-mazing!  wash it down with a great craft beer, or a moscow mule (my favorite).  highly reccommend.  only downside is there is no kids menu, my son only eats the mini corn dogs."}
{"text":"Stopped here with my friend's family for dinner recently. Happened to walk in just as another four top was getting up, so we had a negligible wait, though the space is small and on a busy night you could definitely be waiting a while. I enjoyed the industrial, wood heavy decor.

Service was adequate. The server was a bit abrupt, but I don't particularly mind that if he gets the job done, which he did. 

I ordered a particular beer in  a can ($7!), which they were out of. The server apologized because the menu had not been changed, which he described as \"terrible\". They were out of several other items on the menu, which is fine because that means that most things are fresh and in small batches, which it enjoy.

The food was good. I enjoyed Shawn's burger and truffle fries, though I was disappointed to see that all sides are a la carte. It strikes me that a place like this could at least offer some complimentary pickled vegetables, particularly because it's not an inexpensive meal.

Overall, it's a fine place to grab a delicious, if pricey, burger and fries. I'd recommend going at off hours, or go expecting a wait."}
{"text":"Flip-side has really good truffle fries and good burgers. But lately, everyone has good truffle fries and good burgers. What needs to set a place apart is atmosphere and I think this and the other place (The Rail, I think) is really missing out with the uncomfortable seating, the small spaces, and the group high-tops. If it takes too much effort to wait in line and then the seating is cramped and uncomfortable, I'll go get my burger at any one of the other 10 artisan burger joints in the Akron area."}
{"text":"I took my daughter to Flip Side. She's 16, and sort of a picky eater, but their menu is very comprehensive, and so tempting for those of us that LOVE FOOD that it's hard to choose. We both enjoyed our meals and the experience very much. If we had been in a hurry, it might have been stressful, but since we weren't, no worries!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in on our way to Pittsburgh from Detroit, after using the TV Food Maps app. Since it was featured on Unique Eats, we figured it had to be good. 

Well we were not disappointed at all. We shared the Truffle fries, I had the featured Chili Pepper Burger and my fiancé had the Smokey Burger. The chili sauce was incredibly tasty and spicy - just the way I like it. 

I especially liked that the burgers did not fall apart after a few bites. It held together until the very end, even with multiple dips into the chili pepper sauce. 

I would definitely stop in again if I am ever near Hudson, OH. Yum!"}
{"text":"We had brunch on Christmas Eve morning.
It was wonderful  the food was good and the
Server was very good"}
{"text":"Well, here I am back to my reviews. And just a reminder, I rate restaurants relative to their competitors, so a 5 Star burger joint isn't necessarily the same 5 stars as a gourmet restaurant.  Just is hard to compare such different cuisines on an even playing field.

So back to business, I went to Flip Side without really knowing anything about it other than it was the sister restaurant to One Red Door. (Haven't been there yet but it is on my list.) Unfortunately, I wasn't expecting to get back into writing my Yelp reviews so I can't really comment on what I thought about the decor as I wasn't in my observant mode. I do recall there being a good amount of exposed brick, which I think fit well. But since I didn't take note of my surroundings as I should have on to the food.......(that's why you people read this anyway isn't it?)

The first thing I noticed was that as a craft beer fan, they had a nice beer selection. Points for that.  But I skipped the beer and went right to the milkshakes.  They have a number of interesting sounding milkshakes, some which you can get with liquor in them, one of which with Guinness.  It seemed to be copied off of B Spot in this regard but the shakes at B Spot kick ass so who cares if they are copying a good thing, right?  I ordered the Apple Pie shake. which was basically an apple pie blended into a shake with vanilla ice cream.  Now I happen to be in love with the Apple Pie Maple Bacon Milkshake at B Spot, and as a result that is the standard from which all other apple pie related milkshakes will be judged. So this Flip Side shake was probably a grade of a B. You could definitely taste all the parts of the apple pie but how can you compete with a shake that has bacon in it? I mean bacon makes, EVERYTHING better, don't believe me? Try it in anything and you'll agree I promise. 

On to the burger. I ordered Shawn's Burger, which is pretty much your run of the mill burger plus fried egg. I didn't want to get anything too crazy so I could judge it against B Spot solely on the burger basics.  When the burger arrived the top half of the bun was off and the lettuce tomato etc were off to the side so that you can build the burger the way you like.  To me this is ideal, nothing worse than getting a pre-assembled burger and trying to add toppings or condiments and have the cheese get everywhere but on your burger.  So first bite into the burger.....I was sold.  I need to come back at least one more time to confirm but I feel very confident that Flip Side's burgers will blow away B Spot every time.  Why, you ask? If you have never had Grass fed beef, the different in flavor and juiciness between grass fed and grain fed is unbelievable.  Now I'm not sure what B Spot uses but I'm fairly certain it isn't grass fed beef and to me it makes the burger. Granted it isn't for everyone, a result of the juiciness is a messy burger, but it is a delicious messy one at that and I'll deal with the added mess every time.

As far as the service goes, I felt it was fine, nothing to write home about nothing to complain about.  But either way, I always prefer to give the benefit of the doubt, as it is never fair to judge service over one visit.

Overall I'd highly recommend Flip Side, and I'd even recommend B Spot if you haven't been for so you can make your own comparison."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that I am definitely not a burger girl, nor can I ever fully finish one... but the Red Door Burger was phenomenal. It was the best burger I have ever had and I do not say this lightly. Fries were great, atmosphere was perfect and the service was superb. Absolutely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Yay! I finally found a burger joint close to home that actually cooks a proper meal!

Went here for dinner with a friend and we both thought the food was awesome. I got the Red Door burger and my friend got the Simplicity. We split an order of fries. 

Both burgers were cooked exactly as specified and weren't greasy in the slightest. Portion sizes were generous and the topping to burger ratio was spot on. The fries themselves were seasoned perfectly and a good accompaniment. 

I also ordered a cocktail and it was a good balance of mix/alcohol.

Service was very attentive and friendly and decor was good. It was a little loud but for a Saturday night you can't really complain.

If you don't visit this establishment you're missing out!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with my family and despite the usual pretty long wait, the food is definitely worth it. We always order their chips with the bleu cheese crumbles (I don't remember what they're called) as an appetizer and they are so good. Everyone has tried many different of their burgers and every single one of them is delicious. Best burgers around!"}
{"text":"Food is great, great atmosphere bartender Kerri does great job.  Puts up with our crazy demands and always has a smile on her face..."}
{"text":"This place is purty good.   We went there this past Sunday and sat at the bar.  They have two tvs so good for catching some of your favorite team in between shopping with your lady. I had the turkey burger with sprouts, avocado, and pepper jack cheese and my fella had a plain ole cheese burger, then we split some onion rings with remoulade on the side.  My burger was fantastic.  I washed it down with a pint of Southern tiers Pumking. While  delicious, it is also very pricey, $9 a pint.  The first two beers I asked for they were out of so I had the Pumking.  Not so sure I would've ordered that if I knew the price.  We will definitely be back.  We Love the location in quaint Hudson."}
{"text":"Possibly the best burgers in Hudson, but definitely the best sweet potato fries! It's also a great bar atmosphere to watch a game or meet someone for a drink. At the same time, it's very family friendly and casual. Always an easy option when no one can decide where to go. Just a tip: use the NoWait app to get a spot in line before you arrive because there tends to be a wait for dinner!"}
{"text":"Very good experience, had the chili and Forester Burger. Both were great, def would come back."}
{"text":"Food is good, service can be slow and inattentive which is the only draw back. But my go to for chili pepper burger with a good IPA with big screens for sports games."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I came with a group on a Thursday. First thing I will comment on is the location - sometimes it's hard to find parking, but it's a very cute area. 
Second, this place was loud inside. It was hard to hear the people at the other end of the table. That's really my only gripe about the place. Overall for service, the waitress was very helpful and as prompt as possible. And, they kept my pop & water full... which I always think is a big plus for the service. 

I did not imbibe any adult beverages so I will have to save that for another review. 
However, I did enjoy lots of food. 
Started with the onion rings. The batter is kind of light and crispy and the seasoning they put on them is good! Came with a sauce that paired well. You get about 6 large rings to an order so share with someone else (or maybe a few others). 
I also had a taste of the sweet potato fries which were very good as well as the truffle fries, which I didn't care for as much.... but truffle oil is kind of something I just don't love. 

Ok, now for the good part.. the burgers. 
Both my husband and I really enjoyed the burgers here. The waitress told us at the beginning that all the burgers are cooked med to med-well unless otherwise specified.. I thought this was strange, but I figured I'd go with it. 
I ordered the Black and Bleu burger. This burger comes with these port infused carmelized onions and some really creamy bleu cheese. I thought it was delicious. And you can tell the beef was high quality in this burger. 
My hubs got the Chili Pepper Burger - not super spicy, not super mild. Had a really nice tang from the pickled jalapenos. It came with some spicy ketchup which complimented the burger well. 
Despite thinking it was strange they dictate how \"done\" the burger is.. I have to say.. they hit it on the head for both our burgers - even though I am usually a fan of a much more \"moo-ing\" burger. 
I will definitely be back. Next time I need to save room for the \"Vanilla Date\" milkshake... because that just sounds awesome."}
{"text":"I had been to the Flip Side in Columbus a year ago and really enjoyed it. I finally got to try this one in my neighborhood today. 

We ordered onion rings to start and my husband liked them but I thought they were just OK, not much flavor although looked appetizing. 

I ordered a turkey burger which was very good, a perfect balance of toppings, but again, it needed a little kick to the sauce. 
No effort was made to make a nice sauce, described as red pepper vinaigrette, but seemed similar to sirracha. 

My husband got the Red Door burger and he seemed very satisfied with it. 

We went at 1:30 on a weekday afternoon so was not busy, but still, service seemed slow. 

I would probably go back and I did like the look of the restaurant, but for a gourmet burger place I prefer B Spot."}
{"text":"So, it turns out that on my first visit, I just ordered the wrong thing. On this visit, I ordered the Flip Side burger, and it was delicious! Their truffle fries are good, but nowhere near as good as The Rail. The Ohio Mule cocktail was heaven, and their beer selection is great."}
{"text":"A Sunday afternoon visit found us with two seats at the bar and no wait.  We dabbled in some IPAs and brown ales, thanks to a friendly bartender who allowed us to taste before we committed!  The beer selection here is fantastic.
My burger was just wonderful.  I stuck with the Flipside to keep things 'simple' and I had no regrets.  My friend ordered hers naked (paleo-friendly!), and while the kitchen messed up and sent it out... clothed(?) they fixed it immediately.  Yummy sweet potato fries rounded out the meal.  I will be back next time I find myself in the area!"}
{"text":"Flip Side will forever be one of my favorite burger places. It's second to this place I found in Montana. Any of the burgers simply melt in your mouth. Their Mac n cheese is some of the best I've tasted, and if anyone knows me at all, I am a huge critic when it comes to cheese dishes."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and very convenient with two bars in the building. Go to place for a drink in Hudson."}
