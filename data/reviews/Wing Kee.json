{"text":"Horrible, service was terrible and food was expensive and didn't taste that great at all. Very shocked I've never had bad chinese food before and usually I give second chances but not here. I'll stick to the Warrensville no 1 chinese instead"}
{"text":"The chicken with mushrooms and broccoli was ok, however the House Special Fried Rice was terrible, the yellow rice had no flavor, the roast pork was diced ham! There were 3 pieces of shrimp and barely any chicken, lastly they charged me for hot spicy oil and I didn't even get it, very disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and every time I order the chicken it's overcooked and dry basically it's tougher than Chuck Norris. I'm here to tell you that you can find somewhere else to spend your $5.50 and get a higher quality meal"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, large portions. Standard strip mall take out fare. I had chicken with mixed veggies lunch plate and my husband had the sesame chicken lunch. They both were delicious and big portions."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst chinese food experience I have ever had. My sister and I were hungry and the only places that deliver near me are chinese and pizza. Wanting Chinese instead we ordered here. They leave their menus on our doors so I thought to try them out. Actually I ordered from them one the 4th of July and had a decent experience but this time my sister ordered the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice. She ate it but was mildly disappointed and I ordered the orange chicken and chow mein. I hate the way they make orange chicken taste and the chow mein was 100% inedible. It tasted like 2 week old rewarmed food. I threw it up the second it entered my mouth. Sorry I would highly recommend avoiding this place altogether even if you've bought from them before."}
{"text":"I had to give this place a (3) star due to the fact that they are lacking the flavor that other Chinese Restaurant has. I ordered the \"Beef Ho Fun and Fried Donuts\". I enjoyed the donuts but the beef noodles was lacking in flavor. I did appreciate that they had good beef on it but it seems that they skimp on the soy sauce/seasonings portion. For the price that I paid, it was not up to par with the product. I had better Beef Ho Fun from Li Wah (Downtown Cleveland) with a better price. Now, will I order in the future? Absolutely, I do still want to give their other menus a try but hoping that they vamp up the flavor/spice department otherwise I will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Alright, this is a Chinese take out place. It is not the best food fair. However, the food is moderately decent to good. Interior needs a little TLC. There is seating if you want to dine in. I don't notice whenever I'm in that people opt to do that, but...you know. There is a large selection to choose from on the menu. The food is always made fresh and quickly for that matter. Also they do deliver and are very prompt. The dishes that are stir-fried seem to be the best tasting. The fried foods however, with the exception of the sweet and sour chicken, seem to taste very greasy and overdone at times. Monday-Friday, there is a buffet at $3.99/lb, which is good.   Overall, this is a great place to go to grab a quick filling bite to eat."}
{"text":"As a nearby office worker in Beachwood - Wing Kee is saving grace when I could go for some Chinese takeout in the area.  The portions are huge and perfect for if I also need dinner for working a late night.    Don't expect high quality \"foodie\" fare here, but it certainly beats the median for Chinese takeout in the suburbs and especially beats the \"Chinese Olive Garden\" over on Chagrin Blvd.  +1 star for being the only Chinese place on the greater east side that delivers AND delivers in a timely manner - almost always beating their estimated times."}
{"text":"I'll give them 2 stars not the best in town, but it gets the job done. My girl barely enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is the most disappointing Chinese food I've ever had. The egg roll and the fact they deliver were the only good things about this meal. The dumplings were HORRIBLE. They were really fried dough with some mystery meat filler. The general tsos chicken was really tuff stringy and the sauce had little flavor and wasn't spicy. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Food was just ok, customer service was horrible! Ordered a lunch combo for 5.50 and they brought a dinner and charged me 13.50. Was definitely not worth it. It also took 2 hrs for a delivery I was told 45 minutes. Delivery driver could have cared less so I called to complain and was hung up on from the very rude woman at the restaurant. Won't order there's again."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for probably the last three years or so. My most recent order that I placed was last Monday. When I called a Chinese gentleman answered the phone . This was strange to me because all the times that I've ever ordered in the past a Chinese female took my order, and of course over the years she knew who I was and I knew you who she was , and she knew what I ordered usually. So anyway, I placed my usual order with this new male voice on the phone it was very problematic but I remained patient and repeated my order several times giving him the menu numbers any entree verbiage. Needless to say after all the time I spend on the phone my order was wrong when it delivered an hour and 17 minutes later so I called back down to the restaurant and spoke to the same male voice explaining that my order was incorrect and what changes needed to be made namely boneless spare ribs and the crab rangoon he proceeded to yell and scream on the phone saying and I quote  \"you no order that, you lie you lie\" at this point I didn't know what to do so after 10 minutes I called back down to the Chinese place and spoke to the same male voice and ordered completely new order that's right boneless spare ribs large and large order crab ragoon. So an hour and 45 minutes went by the delivery guy came to my door handed me my order of boneless spare ribs and crab ragoon and tried to charge me $15 and change. I gave him back the unordered untouched food that they dropped off the first visit. The delivery guy opened my screen door and stepped inside my house uninvited and try to take the order of food out of my hand me with recent back problems wanted to punch him in the face and throw him out of the house but I didn't I called Warrensville Heights Police Department. After I made the call he left my house jumped in his car and sped off. I have filed a complaint against this company with Warrensville Heights Police Department they are no longer allowed to come anywhere near me or my home. I've tried several times to reach management leaving my number with one person that could understand what I was saying I have yet to get a return call if I were you looking for Chinese food I would go to the Imperial dragon . Or just find something else to eat the food isn't that great either scale 1 to 10 food quality is a four at best. When I first started going there the food was great but over the last year or year and a half I believe management has changed."}
