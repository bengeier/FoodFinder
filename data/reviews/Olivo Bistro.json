{"text":"I ate there four times. It's an Okay restaurant, when u dont feel like driving on Eastern or to Town Square. . The food was allright.  I think they need better chefs to serve better quality food, etc.  I have had better Italian dishes  in different Restaurants in Henderson or Las Vegas.  (My honest feedback)"}
{"text":"Our server Tyler was great. FOOD WAS AWEFUL!!!!!! I ordered the filet medium rare and it came out red and cold in the middle with black stuff stuck to ir from a dirt grill. I can cook a better steak than what I got at home in half the time! Baked potato was hard as a rock in the middle. Veggies were a generic broccoli, carrot cauliflower mix from a bag same with salad. My daughters alfredo sauce had zero flavor and the pasta was mushy. They actually burned the french fries on my sons entree and I swear the pizza sauce was chef boyardee!!! We use it for pizza night in our house and it was exactly the same!!!!! All of this took almost an hour to get by the way. Absolutely the worst food I've ever had before! I'd rather eat at McDonalds than eat here ever again! If I could give in negative stars I would"}
{"text":"Took out-of-town guests to Olivo Bistro for dinner on a Wednesday evening. Keeping this short and simple; we were embarrassed by the bad dining experience. The food and service were horrible. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place deserves 6 stars , the staff is excellent the food great ...atmosphere always  good. The server Joe is always welcoming and provides fast accurate service. I enjoy spending time at Olivio and recommend it highly . The staff and food are tops. Ask for Joe."}
{"text":"We really wish we could love this place because there aren't many options close to us. I don't think they even try to serve good food. The menu is very simple so I really think it's a lack of effort on managements part. Recently when we ordered eggs and hash browns to go, when we got home, found we only got eggs. Manager mike said the cook didn't know it came with hash browns. It's just annoying because as I said they don't seem to put much effort in providing good food or service.  We keep coming back here because it's close but more often than not, we end up disappointed."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place when it was Giuseppe's.  Great food that really stood out in this area.  Now it's Olivo, not sure what happened but the menu is considerably smaller and some of the more popular dishes are gone...Black and Bleu burger, italian quesadilla, and their famous Giuseppe pizza have been replaced with a very basic bar menu that is no better than PT's across the parking lot.  What a shame.  Save your money, this has turned into a slot bar and not the great restaurant it used to be."}
{"text":"I ordered penne carbonara and the pasta was overcooked - in short, soggy! ... I think they don't know what al-dente means.."}
{"text":"Three visits within four months and no improvements to report. I've given this eatery every opportunity to supply a satisfactory experience. They have failed in every category.  The food is bland and substandard, most likely a frozen product, blasted with microwaves then finished in the oven. Though, I was served a portion of lasagna during my last visit that definitely was not finished in the oven.   The service is impersonal, slow and unapologetic.  Your results may vary, but proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Ok so this place used to be called Giuseppe's.  We had tried it a few times hoping that we would come across some entree that was actually edible.  No luck.  So, when Olivo's replaced it we were very excited to have another restaurant in the area. We figured new name meant new owners, new chef, and new food.  WRONG!!!    We walked into the place and I do have to admit that they did change the dining room by adding a big tree in the middle and took out the TVs, which made for a nicer dining experience.  We were the only people in the restaurant and it still took a while for the waitress to come by.  We looked over the menu.  It is a smaller menu than before, but still offers enough choices.  Once the waitress finally came over, we ordered a pizza and penne vodka.  My hubby tried to order a cup of soup, but was told that if he wanted the soup of the day that we would have to order a bowl.  However, any of the other soups he could order in a cup.  What?!!?  When my hubby said that he would just skip the soup, the waitress very snotty said \"Okaaaayyyyyy\".  She rarely returned to refill our glasses and just was very unfriendly.  I asked the waitress about the new owners.  She said that the owners were still the same, but they brought on new partners and changed the name.  So, that lead to my next question....\"Is the chef and the food the same as Giuseppe's then?\".  The answer was yes, the chef and food was the same...ARGHHH!!!!  They had done the one thing that we could never have imagined them doing...Changing the name, but kept the chef and food the same.  We really just wanted to get up and leave, because we had been down this road before and we knew how it ended up.  We pay a lot of money for bad food.  But, we had already ordered and decided to give it a chance.  They brought out bread with olive oil and balsemic which was good.  Next, the salad came out....completely from a bag type of salad...Just lettuce and a coouple of tomatoes and cucumbers on the side.  Very boring.  I love penne vodka and usually order it at most Italian restaurants.  This was unlike any I've ever had.  It was barely edible and had no flavor at all.  The pizza was just okay.  It had a very thin cracker like crust.  But, I think the real problem is the marinara sauce.  It truly tastes like they just opened a can of Ragu sauce.  It was in my pasta and on the pizza.  So, I would definitely skip this place and go down the street a little bit to Buon Gusto.  They have the best Italian food in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Nice scenery very clean place.  Louis the bartender is attentive so friendly. Loraine the manager is so sweet.  She cares about the costumers needs. The machines pay out here.  Great place!! It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Good local restaurant. It's a lot better than the restaurant that was here five years ago. The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly.  The burgers and homemade chips are pretty bomb. The servings are large so you may have leftovers.  We go in occasionally and it is never crowded. The place is clean and the staff is always friendly. We mostly do phone in and pick up orders and our food is always neatly packed and hot.  We never had a any issues with this restaurant."}
{"text":"So I have eaten here a few times, mainly because the proximity.  I have to say their food is pretty good but their service is excellent. The bartender (did not catch his name) helped tremendously on a pick up order when he saw that I hd my hands full with my toddler.  He took the time to walk the food out to my car even though I knew he had patrons at his bar and he was the only one there.   That is the kind of service that makes me love this restaurant now. Food wise I recommend any of the sandwiches or the feta salad.  It's a favorite of our family's.  Come for the food.  Keep coming back because the service was great."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since it opened as giuseppe and frankly the food has always been ok, but the service was not good. I don't know what they've done but congratulations! The change to Olivo Bistro has made a monumental difference. the food is excellent and the new menu so much better! The experience in the bar is fantastic and all of the bartenders are awesome!"}
{"text":"Horrible place took over an hour to get our foods and we were the only ones there. Foods was ok not the greatest will never go back again which is to bad cause it was close to my house."}
{"text":"Never have had a complete order. This place can't get their  stuff together. I'm stupid for giving them more than four chances. I think the GM stays drinking cause she always at the bar with a drink and has a bad attitude. No true service there. I ordered 10 wings and a side of fries. Was charged correctly but they tried to pass off 6 wings and soggy fries in a tied up bag. After 40 mins it took for the order to come out all they offered is to drop 4 more wings for my trouble. I hear they are changing to a Rounders so new managment will bring me back in since obviously the general manager there is so ignorant and incompetent to be able to run their business or want our business due to their own mistakes in being able to get any of their orders correct. Pizza is awesome tho. Make sure you get double pep but the pizza is great. Dont stay and order to go and you should be fine. Also Patrick is an outstanding bartender. Too bad he has to listen to a GM  that has no business leading a team or being in the service industry."}
{"text":"We went here hoping to try a new place. We ordered 2 soup cups and they both came out as bowls, I questioned the waitress and she said they only come as bowls. Also the waitress was slow because she was way to busy having conversations with the other employees."}
{"text":"The quality of their food (in comparison to when it was Giuseppe's) has dramatically increased in flavor and quality. Lorraine and the wait staff are incredibly warm. Had to deal with a hostess in training who appeared CLUELESS, but all in all, happy to have Olivo in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were hungry late enough in the evening that most restaurants were closed so we decided to give Olivo a try even though the reviews were not great.  It was late enough that the dining room was closed so we had to eat in the bar.  The bartender was super attentive to our needs and provided outstanding customer service even though we were the only ones sitting in a booth instead of at the bar.  I had the beef on weck sandwich and it was really good.  It had a high quality beef and very creamy horseradish.  Yum.  The fries were crisp on the outside yet meaty on the inside.  Very tasty.  My husband had a seafood salad that had very delicious cajun seasoned shrimp.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Worst food...bad wine pour...inexperienced help and not enough of it...seat yourself...flatware wrapped up in your napkin....bread was thin and yukky and we each took one piece and the waiter whisked it away as if we were through with it...we had to ask for the balsamic and oil and they had no clue how to pour it. Both of us left our food, uneaten.  We dined there twice before with 1 year between each visit....3 strikes and you are O U T!!!  it got worse each time."}
{"text":"Had an excellent Beef on Weck sandwich for lunch. The roll was authentic Buffalo-style, with salt and caraway seeds. The horseradish was fresh and tasty. And the cole slaw was creamy and crunchy.   Service was ok (I ate in the bar, and the bartender was chatting with his friends but easy to call over).   The bar menu is limited compared to the restaurant, and I will try the restaurant for dinner to see if the food is as good."}
{"text":"Anthony B calls this a regular slot bar?  I don't know what bars he's referring to, but the food quality at Olivo's (and Giuseppe's as it used to be called) is well beyond anything to be found at PT's or virtually any other \"slot bar\" I've been to - and I've been to a lot.  That being said, the menu has been cut down somewhat.  When I asked about it, I was told the management would rather do fewer things better than try to be everything to everyone and have quality suffer as a result. Sounds like a good idea to me.  Also, I was told that the restaurant menu had more selections on it and wouldn't you know, the pizza Anthony misses (along with maybe other items - I didn't look at it too long) is still on the dining room menu, which is also available in the bar during typical dinner hours of I believe 4pm-8pm or something like that.  In any case, I like to gamble, eat, drink and be merry, and I can do so here easily at any time.  There were some service issues several months ago after they first opened as Giuseppe's, but since then the staff has really come around and the place has never been better.  They've redone the entrance, remodeled the dining room and even added a progressive to a couple of machines - both $1 and quarters - in the bar.  I look for good paytables when playing, and the ones at Olivo's are still far and away the best in the area. Surprisingly enough they didn't even use the name change as an excuse to tighten things up as I've seen other places do in the past - WTG Olivo's!  If you want quality Italian food in a pleasant atmosphere, a good bar to hang out at, a fair gamble or a fine place for a quick bite at lunch (as with my trip here this visit) then Olivo's is the answer in Anthem.  If you want a gigantic menu with mediocre food then go find a Cheesecake Factory and take Anthony with you.  Giving a place one star based solely on a name change and slightly reduced menu is BS unless there's a service or quality issue to go with it, and I didn't hear that in his review.  I'll give five stars to help balance out the unfairness.  Shame on anyone giving a one-star review based on nothing but losing their favorite meal due to a menu change - that's not what Yelp is about.    And truthfully Olivo's might be worth a five star rating anyway - time will tell - but certainly a solid 4 - 4 1/2 is well earned already.  Welcome to the neighborhood Olivo's - I look forward to seeing you again soon when I have more time!"}
{"text":"We are in Henderson visiting family and decided to give Olivos a try.  We had dinner tonight and had zero complaints. We had four adults and one kid and sat in a large, comfy booth in the non-smoking dining room side. Unfortunately my daughter was not on her best behavior so it was hard to enjoy dinner - but it wasn't at all the fault of the staff, restaurant, etc.  The waiter promptly greeted us, brought menus and took drink orders. We had our drinks and breadsticks quickly and placed our orders. Salads and soup came out and were great. The food is simple, but good. Then our entrees came out. My dinner was a little cooler than I prefer, but the food was excellent. Actually all 5 of us enjoyed our dinners. I got the spaghetti and meatballs and it was excellent. The meatballs were huge and delicious and the serving size was huge -leftovers!  Overall we'd all come back! It was sad to see the place empty. It was very good!"}
{"text":"Good food is not enough to carry you, mediocre food and average service will kill you! We have tried Olivio Bistro more then several times, it keeps getting worse and we won't be back. A tell tale sign that things are not stable is the one only person that is always there is the bus girl. Tonight we the straw to break the camels back and perhaps they caught me on a bad night but as mentioned earlier not our first time here. They advertise both \" Italian wedding and Pasta Fragioli soup\" but only in a bowl not in a cup. When I asked why I was told \" because it's made fresh and it would cost to much to make only for a cup\" LMAO PLEASE show me a chef who can make a FRESH Soup in 3 minutes!!!  I ordered a $9.50 martini it came out warm and less then 3/4 of the way filled in the non chilled glass, I asked to speak to the manager and a waiter said that \" it seemed about the right size and the manager actually made the drink\" but he brought it back, a second later the manager came storming out and placed the same drink back on the table, classy. 2 minutes later our waitress brought out my salad and 5 seconds later brought out our entrees. The salad at best was wilted and warm. My entree was lasagna was perfectly microwaved with watered down marinara sauce, if it was any good it would've been been called gravy, I'm sure the bread was good however we never received any, the table next to us asked for some bread and were refused unless they paid for it because they didn't order an entree???? We ordered an entree. During our meal the joke of a manger made his rounds from table to table to ask how everything was, we heard several table complain and he have a cheesy smile and said \"ok\" and moved to the next table. Finally he came to our table and asked how everything was I said \" at best it's ok\" he tapped the table and said \"well it's ok\".... Our server was sweet but not well trained, but you can't have the blind leading the blind. We have tried to support local so many times but we  will now drive further for quality!!!"}
{"text":"We went here at 5:00 and we were the only ones here for the whole dinner , which was  1 1/2 hrs. Ordered calamari with hot peppers. Calamari was not crispy and hardly any peppers and they were sweet NOT hot.  Had to ask if they had the bread with olive oil. Waiter said I was just going to ask you. Should have brought it before the appetizer. The bourbon drinks were good. We shared the chicken picatta. I had to ask for lemon, Parmesan and red pepper to spice it up. It was flavorless. It's a shame because the restaurant is beautiful. The two stars was for the drinks."}
{"text":"Very slow service and seem to always get something wrong. Prices are way out of line for the quality of the food.  Sad its a very nice looking place and has potential."}
{"text":"Pretty gross all around, from the broccoli that tasted like fish thrown all over my piccata to the bland, white chicken. The guy who took my order over the phone was nice...but that's about it."}
{"text":"Horrible combative bartender. He was training someone new behind the bar. She was making my drink 90 percent soda water with a splash of vodka while he made my husbands drink. First time in my life I have ever sent a drink back. I told him it was all soda water. He actually yelled at me and told me I was wrong. I was shocked at how he spoke to me. I have been in a couple of times prior to order to go food after work. The owner has always been at or behind the bar. Not this time. My husband has even tried to go in to eat after work. People were sitting at the bar but no one around to open the door. Strange. Horrendous service and I will never come back now due to the bartender. Sad. He along with their not so great food is killing their business. The amount of terrible reviews of this place tell the story. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Their Sicilian pizza is the BEST. No, it's not cheap, but it's one of the best pizzas in town by far. The manager is very friendly and helpful too! Love it."}
{"text":"Man this place is not good at all. First off the food took forever to come out and we were the only people in the restaurant so not sure what took so long. Secondly the meals we ordered were just not done well. Seafood salad had a bland flavor and the crab was definitely frozen possibly from Costco because it has no flavor at all. Also I got 4 mini shrimp total in my seafood salad. Don't need to come back to this place ever"}
{"text":"After coming here for a few years, I would place Olivo in my Top 3 poker bars within the greater Henderson area. They also have MUCH better than your average appetizers! I'm a fan of the eggplant Napoleon and the stuffed mushrooms.  Try a pizza, the first one I had here was one of the best pizzas I've had in Vegas!  And, the takeout pizza price for a Large (maybe just Mon-Thurs) is so reasonable, $10.95 plus $1 per topping. However, I was charged $3 for adding bacon which I didn't see on the menu.   They have Crafthaus Brewery Resinate IPA on draft- so support your local brewery! Service at the bar is great and they are quite friendly as well! I like the variety of poker games they have and they are Gambler's Bonus affiliated. I joined their text club for gaming promos and received just one text for a match play and that was over a year ago.  I hope they reinstate it!!"}
