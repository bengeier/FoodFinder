{"text":"After seeing the sign from about 15 blocks away ,and as that burger got bigger and bigger I knew that this was going to be the best place for me to go to cheat on my diet.  Walking into this place you realize that this is an awesome hang out , after checking out the menu of some wild burgers i made my choice the friendly chef grilled our burgers to Perfection you can really see the passion this dude has creating a mouth watering master piece.   Now I've checked out everyone else reviews and there may have been some issues there in the past but I'll tell you HOLY !@#$% the burger was @$$#$$  delicious flavorful moist juicy and freaking #@%%^ fantastic i had no guilt at all putting down a burger and a 1/2 1/2 a poutine witch was excellent 1/2 a pack of fries ..Yea that's what i did and SO what I'd do it again but i didn't wear spandex pants just sitting here typing this is reminding me of how good it was and i am really considering to take the 1/12 hour drive just to go back and eat another 4 burgers .. passing this place and not stopping in for a burger is not only a mistake it should be illegal . i will be back again as soon as i can find pants with a bungy cord waistband ..."}
{"text":"Late night spot....hole in the wall.....burgers were \"meh\"....stale buns....over priced....drunkies everywhere.  We were out-of-towners and just wanted to grub after insane amounts of beer.  This was the closest 24hr spot to our hotel.  Eat here if you dont care about taste and food quality."}
{"text":"Ok so this place was right up the street from our hotel, so we went a couple time :s lol They make a MEAN burger, like this bad boy is large and just rude hahah the first time we went they were super busy and the girl never asked me if i wanted everything on it, so i got all the fixings including thsoe i didnt like.... Theres somethigna bout montreal and everything coming with coleslaw...its strange. The one complaint is that there coleslaw sucks (and i think its saurkraut but they said slaw..) I pulled it right off my burger, but they thing is juicy and made to order! frikken delish. The poutine isnt half bad either, the gravy could use some work lol. The have alot of shit on the menu but the best is the burger. Second time around it wasnt busy and the guy let us eat before we paid which was nice. They have a good dine in and patio area going on which is nice. Im for sure down for a brochette burger anytime!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  So they finally started seasoning their meats, which was a good start, but their cook staff changes literally every other week.  Every time I go in, it's someone different cooking my food, to the point where I just stopped going again.  They are not consistent.    Their ingredients are still staying out uncovered all day, collecting bacteria, and depending on who is cooking that day, you may get well cooked food, burned food, or raw food.  It's hit or miss.  I give up on this place.  Not giving it another chance.  Especially at their insanely high prices.    And their rice is like eating bullets.  It's ALWAYS undercooked and tasteless.  Yuck."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice.   First time I ordered the steak, and it was super mediocre.   However, just went there today and had their burger, and was completely blown away.    Totally awesome.    They have all kinds of ingredients (and it is for sure sauerkraut not slaw) which I love.   Very sloppy burger but extremely tasty.    I will definitely be going here again and getting the burger.   Next time I'll  try a poutine too."}
