{"text":"Use to be a regular to the Barrie location but we haven't been in a while because the quality seemed to have dropped and the service wasn't so great.  Went to the Woodbridge location this week and we were pleasantly surprised!  The pizzas were outstanding (cooked perfect!) and the service was great.  I'm glad we gave it a try again.  I can't speak about the other locations.   We had the wings, a couple of za's and the Mac n' cheese.  Everything was perfect!  We will return."}
{"text":"Perfect for all seasons, Pie serves up one of the better thin crust pizzas in the city.  The variety available for order is exceptional and the staff is very friendly.  I came with my husband on a whim and we ordered two delicious gourmet style pizzas that showcased Pie's unique style and fresh sensibilities.  The environment and décor is very warm and the menu etched into the dining table is the kind of uncommon trait that makes Pie endearing."}
{"text":"Had a pizza from here and the shape was deformed slices were small. Too expensive for a pie that doesnt fill a single person"}
{"text":"One of the best and most unique pizza places in Vaughan. Friendly staff, always a fun time. I Was one of the few to try their food challenge... It's almost impossible to do LOL three pizzas each topped with an egg, bacon, pepperoni with the last pizza  topped with 1lbs of poutine  eat it in 35 minutes and it's free!"}
{"text":"Love these pies! Wish I would have discovered this place sooner. Always get great service and the food is unbeatable!"}
{"text":"A good place to enjoy food and watch a game!  This restaurant is not your typical family owned pizza joint as it is a franchise that has spread all over southern Ontario!   We went on a wet and snowy day so there weren't that many people around! Service was still for whatever reason slow. We asked for olive oil and it took 15 minutes to receive! Pizza did arrive in around the same time range!   The food was yummy - after two pizzas (more cowbell, and the only one with clams), a glass of wine and a dessert to share, we were paying about $65-70 which seemed pricy considering we could have just ordered in for less than half that price!"}
{"text":"great place to have pizza as well as a nice environment staff was very friendly and really can not complain about anything.  Highly recommend for any foodie who wants to try a delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Was craving a nice thin crust pizza that was made in wood oven.  Found this place close to my house, and reviews sounded good....... walking in I saw people walking out with pizza boxes figured it must be good for people to be walking out with all these pizzas.  Ordered my pizza, got cokes in bottles with it, which is the best tasting coke product.  The good taste ended there.  These pizzas are LOADED with GARLIC!! Like all you taste is overload of garlic in the sauce, i thought it was terrible! One of worst pizzas I have ever eaten and I've been to Cuba.  Thats bad. Crust is oily and reminds me of old Canadian dominos pizza(before it changed for bit better). After leaving this place it was all burps heartburn and garlic.  I have no idea why people say its good, its like garlic with cheese and ragu sauce.  So disappointed, if you love garlic than maybe this place is your thing, but very surprised woodbridge with the highest concentration of Italians, who cook such good food, some how keep this place going with such garbage pizza.   If you want to have garlic fumes and burps coming out of you for the next 48hrs, than you should definitely eat here.  Better to get a Dr oetker from freezer if you ask me."}
{"text":"Pretty decent atmosphere - excellent pizza - try to get a seat outside because it's a bit noisy - amazing place to take the kids"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here.  Crust has a wonderful taste and texture.  Had a Yelp special pizza-eh and loved it for $10.  We have been to two locations and they were both great."}
{"text":"Last night we visited PIE in Woodbridge for the 1st time and it did not disappoint. My wife heard about this franchise called PIE that started up in Barrie on CityLine.   We were 2 families (4 adults and 3 kids) we had: 1.  APPS:  the salty balls (balls of cooked pizza dough with bacon and mozzarella on them) were delicious and a hit with everyone including the kids. 2.  We all ordered pizzas and liked the thin crispy crust from the wood burning oven and no pizza was \"skimpy\" with the toppings.   I had the Porky Pie which was like a meat-lovers and it was delicious. 3.  DESSERTS:  I enjoyed the Espresso Float (hot espresso coffee poured over vanilla ice cream).  Others had cappuccino coffees and cheesecake and were all happy with their choices.  Try this place out because once the word gets out you won't be able to get in this place on a weekend in Woodbridge.  Enjoy - hope this helps!!!!"}
{"text":"This place had great pizza and we went during a promotion event so the pies were half price."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this joint out for about 6 months.  Finally did tonight and my excitement quickly turned to let down.  The place is actually quite nice and our server seemed friendly. BUT We ordered a cesar salad and pizza with peperoni, bacon and mushrooms.  Our salad came to us and the lettuce was gone bad.  It was brown n pink.  The pizza underneath was burned.  When I complained to the server, she said she agreed that the salad should have never been served to us like that, while she was walking towards us and even before she looked at the salad.  She knew already.  She did take the price of the salad off our bill.  She blamed the chef.  I didn't bother to complaining about the pizza.  Then I got the bill and I now feel like I was robbed of $28.  Not to mention now we are all at home fighting for the toilet lol.  Don't waste your time on Pie in pickering.  Go down the street and buy a $20 pizza that is way better and that won't give you the shits."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday, early lunch time. This was my first visit.  It has a casual feel about it. Separate restaurant and bar area with lots of TV's on various sports channels. Only a few other tables were occupied so it was fairly quiet.     Pizza is food I eat fairly often and feel I have a pretty good idea what makes a good one. Ive eaten at all the big chains, pizza pizza, pizza nova, etc. Those pizza's are all ok. They fit the bill.  Sometimes you just want a pizza on a Friday night so you call one of them up.  This pizza was different, it tasted like how you imagine a proper pizza should.    The server was friendly and efficient and our pizzas took around ten minutes, (maybe even less) to come to our table.  Initially I thought the pizza would be so so. I was wrong. It was amazing.   I went for the PORKY PIE: which is : Tomato Sauce Base, Mozzarella, Double Smoked Bacon and Sausage,Topped with Prosciutto and Bas. Other people at the table went for the Hind Leg Pie. They too thought it was very good.    My pizza was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too crispy, just spot on. Loads of flavor and delicious toppings.   It probably wont be to everyone taste as we have all become accustomed to the big chain pizzas and think that's how they all taste (myself included)  Lots of people don't like freshly squeezed orange juice but that's how it should taste. The stuff you buy in the store like Tropicana etc, just has a flavor pack added to it so it taste like orange juice (google it and see for yourself) You have to pay a lot more for real orange juice but at this place you don't have to pay a lot more for real, great tasting pizza. The price is spot on and so is the pizza. I'm already looking forward to going back to try another one!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Best server, Joanna! make sure you ask to seat in her section,you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"This evening was the first time we went to PIE, Pickering.  There was no sense of organization from the moment you walked through the door. No one/hostess greets you. You must look for someone to take your name and number of people in your party. One of the hostesses writes your information down in crayon which they are unable to read when they are calling for you. There is no waiting area, there are however game machines which no-one uses instead people are leaning against them. This front area would be better served with benches for people to sit until their table is ready. As you are waiting, you are able to enjoy the view out the window to the outdoor patio which was covered with garbage and the tables which were overturned on top of other patio tables had gum stuck to the bottom of each and everyone of them. You also can watch one of the hostesses drying cutlery in the front entrance with a paper napkin. There are a couple of TV's playing videos such as LMFAO and 50 Cent, which are totally inappropriate for the number of families with young children that were there. It also doesn't need to be so loud, no one was paying attention. People were trying to have conversations. Once our waitress came to our table, we found her friendly and she served our drinks quickly. We ordered three different pizza's - all were good. Crust was nice but a slightly burnt along the edges.  We also had a family sized pasta dish (spaghetti & meatballs). For what we paid for, it was more of a single size not family size. You did get a good portion of meatballs but unfortunately there were luke warm. We had to ask for cutlery, serving spoons, & napkins. No parmasean cheese or peppers were ever brought to the table. We were never offered refills for our drinks. We never saw a manager just a lot of inexperienced staff running around. The atmosphere at this restaurant is terrible and much improvement is needed."}
{"text":"Great wheel. Fresh and delicious. Friendly service from start to finish. Had an amazing  appetizer, 4 cheese dip with pizza crust. We ordered the porky pig pizza. It was great. So many different combinations to try. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Terrible service...waited 30 minutes and nothing.  Meanwhile, a family sat down beside us and they got served promptly within 5 minutes.  Anyways, we were decided to give them a chance and let someone knew that we needed a server...15 minutes later....no one showed up. And to think I loved that place.  But they lost me on it. I'm never coming back.. So unless you can wait...you're  welcome to go visit this place. My time is precious"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had in woodbridge, and that's saying a LOT.  Reasonably priced and insurmountably delicious.  I'd personally recommend the Hedgehog pizza for meat&spice lovers. The topping:cheese:sauce ratio was divine. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this place one bit. We we're seated relatively fast but we waited 10 mins for a server to come by the table for the first time and ask for a drink order. We waited another 5 mins to receive our drinks, one of which was coffee, and the server had only filled the cup less than half full and plopped it on the table, then quickly rushed away. Keep in mind this place was not busy, and our server was not the only one in the front of house. After a couple more minutes she came back to take our orders. We did not see her until the bill...I had to ask another server for refills on our drinks. As far as the food goes, I wasn't really a fan. We ordered the meatball sliders, which were toasted white bread with a possibly frozen ( had very little flavour) meatball and a bit of cheese on top. Not what I expect when I order a slider...I ordered the a pizza with pulled pork, cant remember the name and it seemed undercooked in the middle but it was burnt in places and maybe that;s how woodstove pizza's are supposed to taste but I wasn't a fan nor was my husband. The cherry on the cake however; was when the server just brought our bill. Did not ask if we wanted dessert ( which I actually did!) and just said \" no rush\" and walked away....sadly, I think the service is what is going to stop me from trying this place again. Side note: I was a server/bartender for 10 years, and normally I chalk poor service to someone having a bad day, being in the weeds, not enough management support etc,and give a bit of leeway knowing it can be hard sometimes but  this service was just piss poor on the part of the server and I wish I could remember her name because I would write a formal complaint as I think she needs some training."}
{"text":"Tried PIE for the first time yesterday.  I'm torn between hoarding it for myself and sharing how awesome they are with everyone. :) I won't say any more than try it out and be impressed.  Everything about the place is great.  I would change nothing!"}
{"text":"Pizzas here are quite amazing! They come in one size; one pizza should be good for 2 people unless you are really a big eater or super hangry. We had the Fun guy and porkie pizzas. Fun guy was a white pizza packed with mushroom and a gentle cheese flavour, my favourite for the night. The porkie was also a bit salty but not bad. The secret is to eat the pizza whilst it is hot. I once had the St Lucia which was a slightly sweet pizza (coconut and pineapple); it was a take out - I think it would have been bette r hot. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The first time I went to PIE was quite some time ago for a friends birthday and I loved it! We had ordered some appetizers, a couple salads and the salty balls, they were amazing and reasonably priced. For our mains we ordered a few pizzas to share amongst the group. We ordered the Veggie Pie, Pepperoni Pie, Hind Leg Pie and Chicken Pie. I tried some of each and have nothing bad to say about any of them! The pizzas were cooked perfectly and had a generous amount of toppings on them. Extremely filling! Service was also outstanding!  The ambiance of the restaurant is wonderful as well. I especially enjoyed how there's a separate bar and eating area, it's great for families!   Since that evening I have made sure to go back and recommend PIE to any pizza lover I know! With great prices, service and food it has to be one of the best pizza joints in Woodbridge!"}
{"text":"we recently went to the Barrie location. what an experience. very pleased with customer service, food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Stinky Pie, Hedge Hog Pie and the Pepperoni Plus Pie for delivery through skip the dishes. Liked them all. Crust had a nice chew. I love the hot pepper puree on Hedge Hog. Wish the aioli was a little lighter. The Maple Chili glaze on the Pepperoni Plus was more on the sweet side and not so much on the spicy side. The Stinky was exactly what I was expecting. Will definately be ordering again. I'm looking forward to trying other ones."}
{"text":"Went there for an early dinner 5pm and they were out of 3 items that we requested including chocolate ice cream for dessert. As a restaurant being out of items is embarrassing and a no no. Tasted the pizza and it seemed so simple, nothing special. Seems like thin pita bread (whole wheat). Menu is on the table printed but depending on where you sit too dark to read the menu. On the plus side place looks good n clean throughout."}
{"text":"Great pizzas.  Three in our party, 3 different pizzas - all excellent.  Service was great and attentive.  Price a bit on the higher side, but not excessive.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great pizza loved this place!!!!! I think my favorite thing on the the menu was the salty balls if you are in the mood for pizza this is place to go"}
{"text":"This place definitely has some of the best pizzas! I came here for lunch today. They serve wood oven pizza and this place is a sit down restaurant. I had the Slow 'n Low Pie (Pulled Pork, Apple Slaw, BBQ Sauce, Caramelized Onions, and other toppings) and I got the individual lunch size one. It was more than enough for myself. I was super full after that. The \"pie\" take a very short time to cook - apparently its ready in 90 seconds after you order it. It probably takes an additional few minutes to put the toppings on top though. It was amazing I can still taste it in my mouth while writing this review. The only reason why I did not give this place a 5 star is because of the service. The server who placed our order was awesome! But the server who was taking care of our payment was not. She was VERY slow. We were a large group, but she was very inefficient. She took her sweet time and they only had one machine.   I will definitely come back again though!"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best pizzas!!!!! Super friendly waiter Scott. I only wish i would have ordered another pizza to take home. The menu is great, hard to choose when everything sounds delicious."}
{"text":"Just OK.  Service is nice and friendly. The pie just doesn't hit the spot.  The dough is missing some substance. Probably a fun restaurant to go with lots of kids, but don't go for the food, it is just adequate."}
{"text":"I went when they first opened and wasn't too happy with the taste of the tomato sauce on the pizza. Its was very acidic much like some of the lower end takeouts. But I went back a few more times and discovered the sauce was much better.  It's a great family place with a separate bar section if you want a place to hang out with friends. Wings are fire roasted and great but they need to add more flavours - currently only one flavour.   Wing places generally do well In the area and Pie should capitalize."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the experience after trying this restaurant out, sight unseen! Food is delicious and atmosphere warm and inviting.  Pie, of course, focuses on Pizza for its menu, but within that there's a lot of variety.  Pizzas are hand made, with style and toppings that are more traditional - a 'sit down' European meal, rather than the American 'fast food' variant.  Tried the Hedgehog and Cow pies, and both were fantastic. Hedgehog is a 'meat lovers' kind of pizza while Cow has a cheese sauce base (ie: hold the tomato). Flavors pop and the presentation will make foodies load their cameras. :)  Aside from the menu, Pie also offers 'build your own pizza', & a few options for dough/crust (gluten free, multi-grain, others) for those wanting to customize.  Appetizer choice reflects the same. Great place to go if you wanna try this favorite outside its standard North American fare.  In the Woodbridge area, Pie has excellent, spacious dining room as well as a seperate bar area. The colors are warm & fun, emphasized by the menus being printed onto the tables.  I've recommended this nee spot to a few friends already, and extending that to anyone reading here!"}
{"text":"Took my family to Pie because my kids really liked the one in Collingwood. The pizza is thin crust and there are variety of options to choose from."}
{"text":"It was decent. Went with a party of 4. Nothing to write home about but nothing that would convince me not to come back.   We got 4 different pizzas and drinks. Food came out at a decent time considering it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"I really don't know what it is about pie that I don't enjoy that much, but everything is just alright for me.   My friend recommend me try the salty balls, which is deep fried pie dough with garlic butter and bacon. There was nothing special about them. I've also had their pie salad before, which is a pretty standard green salad with a red wine vinaigrette. It was okay. Of course I'd have to try one of their pizzas before I had a final opinion about them. I went with Fun Guy pie. Basically a cheese pizza with mushrooms and spinach. It was a good at first, but then it was a struggle for me to finish it because I just didn't enjoy it much anymore. Perhaps it was too cheesy for my liking (?) I don't know. I guess I should've went with a more classic pizza choice.  Nothing memorable about the place itself really."}
{"text":"This continues to be one of our favorite pizza places.  We went back a couple of days ago and they are still good.  I got the \"Hind Leg\" which is a pizza topped with mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugala which was quite good, although I did have a couple of small charred spots on the edge of the crust I had to cut off.  My husband got the \"Salty Pie\" which has an egg on the top which is supposed to have a runny yolk, but they had left it on too long and it was cooked through.  He wasn't bothered enough to sent it back, but that is why they only got a 4 this time."}
{"text":"A special thank you to Kris, our community manager, and the YELP team for another great event!  From absolutely-cute-unique-and-necessary Yelp name tags to unique Italian beverages to over the top delicious pizzas, PIE is a must-try!   The staff is friendly and obliging and the venue is clean and welcoming. The pizzas aren't dough-y and loaded with unique toppings. The spicy hedgehog was really tasty.   I had a great time eating, drinking and meeting other friendly Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Our team came here for a work lunch in the middle of the week. The place is very spacious and can handle large groups. However, their service cannot.   Speed: I understand that good pizza takes time to make, and cooking them in a stone fire oven is probably a more delicate process than with modern ovens. That's fine. However, it shouldn't take nearly an hour to get our pizzas. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, perhaps a handful of diners. How do they expect to serve a full house if it takes that long to handle a group of 12?   The pizza was delicious, however. The menu is neatly printed onto the tables themselves, which we thought was pure genius. There are a lot of interesting toppings combinations, I wanted to try them all! The salty balls are fried pizza dough balls. They weren't overly salty, so don't let the name scare you. But they do come in a large portion, so if you're ordering them as an appetizer then don't overfill yourself! Save room for the pizza!  The prices are on the higher side, to cover the fire cooked process and unique toppings. However, depending on what you're ordering, it may not be worth the price.  For example, one of us ordered the standard Margherita pizza, I forgot what they call in in their menu, The Queen something I believe. Anyway, it says on the menu it includes basil, but when the pizza arrived it just had a small sprig of basil in the middle of the pizza as garnish. Not even a complete topping!  It was a good first taste, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Fun pizza joint with a wide variety of pizza styles. The buttery salty \"salty balls\" are a favourite app. Salads are great too."}
{"text":"Very bad service and food wasn't much better. Came in and the restaurant wasn't busy. We told the server that the kids were super hungry and yet it still took over an hour to get our meals. after asking a manager where our food was, she noted that the server didn't even enter our order until 32 minutes after our arrival. Food came and it was a disappointment. Pizza was sloppy and messy, dough was rubbery. Pasta was salty with a pond of water at the bottom. Coffee was cold and full of grinds. The manager offered us a free dessert which took an additional 25 minutes to come. We would never go back."}
{"text":"Was so disappointed in my experience with the food here after hearing such good things about the place. I ordered the stinky pizza and my boyfriend ordered a diavola type pizza. Mine was dripping in oil...I asked the server what was up with my greasy pizza as my hands were covered in oil and she said it was from the water in the pear and offered nothing in return: the pear may have been a small contributor, but it was the excess unneeded oil added by the pizzaiolo. My boyfriend's pizza had the garlic dipping sauce drizzled all over his pizza and the sauce was not good at all."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite pizza place! The GBC gives you the \"wow-melt-in-your-mouth-what-just-happened!?\" feeling.... It's definitely a staple menu item! Staff is always super sweet and fast. Their pizza is great, I honestly love the tomato based sauces more than the cheese based but the best thing is you can always build your own pizza. I wish they had beef salami or bresaola toppings available which is why I removed 1 star."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza place. Wouldn't go out of my way to come here. Had the beauty pie, it was ok. Nothing I never had before. My husband had the chicken pie, not much chicken on the pizza. Had to add lots of franks hot sauce to make the pizzas better"}
{"text":"Chicken pie is my favourite but I'm on a mission to try them all. So far I have not had a bad one yet (5 and counting lol) The crust is cooked perfectly and fresh toppings. Fast service. The Mac and cheese is very good as well. My son loves the cheese pizza. Kid friendly"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I've been to. Ordered the fries appetizer and fun guy pizza. Fries came with ketchup and garlic aioli dip, which was very good, but the fries were very very plain. Nothing above average. The pizza however was SO delicious. Tasted very fresh and the the wood fired cooking style definitely makes a difference and makes it stand out compared to other pizza joints. Their is a bar area and the seating in the main dining area is quite spacious. Would definitely come back to try their other pizzas. Pizzas are average priced but more toward the pricey side, but it's understandable as their pizzas are so delicious."}
{"text":"On the hunt for a new pizza joint, I came across this little gem. Only opened for a month, Pie had a continuous stream of people entering and many happy customers leaving. It's located just west of Brock Rd on Kingston Rd. TIP: The plaza address is blocked by bushes, but I have a handy dandy picture of the outside above! You can't miss it and you don't want to!  The inside is shiny and new. It screams fun. The menus are printed on the actual table! I thought that was a great way to save on paper! You think a regular pizza joint has a lot of choices for pizza? You are wrong. These are not your average pizzas. Delicious combinations laid out on an fresh, ultra thin pizza crust is always a winner.  They come in one size equaling 6 slices or about the same size as a smaller, frozen pizza. It safely fed my mother and I, but if you are a guy or a hungrier gal, you might want to get your own pizza. The prices are good, so getting more than one pizza just lets you try more!   The servers were very young, but attentive. It was busy and they realized there was a gap in between dishes, so they gave us our drinks on the house. This locations is very knew, so growing pains are to be expected.   We started with the Cornflake Crusted Calamari. It was so tender; I don't know how they did it. It was comparable to expensive restaurants! The breading wasn't overpowering, just a hint of cornflakes.  What a great combo!   After much deliberating, we chose the Porky Pie. Topped with slices of prosciutto, wood fired bacon an spicy sausage. It was fantastic. The prosciutto and bacon were perfect and then you'd get the surprise of spicy sausage hiding underneath. The crust was so thin, that we finished the pie and felt satisfied, not in a food coma.    That means there was room for dessert! The Nutty Pie had been calling us since we sat down. Ultra thing pizza crust topped with nutella, banana and crème de leche. Why didn't _I_ think of that?? It was amazing. It makes me want to put anything I would put on a pancake or crepe on pizza crust.   A great experience and I'd love to go back and try some of there other pie creations!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last night and had a really good experience. The ambiance is cozy and warm and perfect for families but probably won't be ideal if you want a romantic dim lit environment for the perfect date night.   *** EXCITING NEWS!!! ***  They have gluten free crust and vegan dairy free cheese!!!  *** GASP!!! ***   We ordered a salad and pizza pie to share! We started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was presented nicely in a wooden bowl. It featured pears, walnuts, blue cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. We omitted the cheese, so it would be gluten and dairy free and we both really liked the salad. My only criticism would be how flimsy the salad bowls were. Once they had less food within, they were easy to flip. I can imagine this would be a problem if a child was eating out of these bowls. We had to be careful to not flip them.   Once we finished our salad, we were brought our pepperoni plus pizza pie. It was absolutely delicious! It was made with a thin gluten free crust, dairy free mozzarella, tomato sauce, pepperoni and a maple Chile glaze, which we asked for on the side. The pizza was absolutely delicious. I love how great it tasted and it was a treat to receive a big gluten and dairy free pizza at a restaurant that was big enough to share.   The maple Chile glaze was spicy and sweet; I was really glad we asked for it on the side as it was the perfect sauce to dip our crust into. My boyfriend loved putting the sauce on his pizza but I preferred to use it as a dipping sauce or the pizza would have been a bit too sweet for me.   All over we both loved our meal and we would return here again for another gluten and dairy free pizza. The employees working at this location were also very friendly."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to check it out. Was pretty surprised to see how big this place was and how packed it was on a Sunday night! Service was super friendly and it did not take too long for them to seat us and get us started.   The food here was incredibly delicious and far exceeded my expectations. Pappardelle - the noodles were super soft and the braised brisket was super tender. It took me by surprise how flavourful this was and how satisfying it was to eat. 9/10 Hedge Hog pie - the pie was thin and not overly saucy; how I like my pizzas. The flavour of the pepper puree complimented the spicy sausage and aioli. 7/10.   I really enjoyed the food and service and will be back again."}
{"text":"I had a gluten free pizza with beef brisket and I was surprised by how good it was. It was my first time there and the waitress was very friendly and helpful. I am not even a pizza fan normally but actually liked the food there."}
{"text":"First time visit.  All I have to say is bring your appetite!   Portions are amazing.   Two adults and two kids,  fed for $85 all in.   Service was super fast.   Waitresses were so nice.   Most importantly,  the place was totally wheelchair friendly.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum! Three of us ordered three different pies to share, Clamtastic, Hedge Hog and one with duck (can't remember the name). All were delish, the menu has quite a lot of options and we will be back for sure. Service was great but then again we were the only table there. That is probably my only complaint - where was everyone?? Save space for the sweet balls, they were fantastic but heavy. Deep fried dough balls smothered in powdered sugar and dulce de leche. We left stuffed and happy! Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place had a good atmosphere and the menu was straight forward with enough options where it wasn't boring or overwhelming. I found it on the pricer side and they had half off of the kids menu which wasn't advertised..  I didn't think the pizza had a wow factor, maybe because I love pan pizza?   Food is good, value is decent.  Will I return.. maybe just to try another pizza"}
{"text":"This place is joke! They served burnt pizza, and salad with no dressing! Nobody knows what they're doing! The worse customer service and food!"}
{"text":"Decide to stay in to have some 'pie'. The young woman who greeted me also served me and was extremely accommodating.  I had some Yukon fries as an appetizer and an anchovy and caper pie with a tomato base.  The Yukon fries was a large portion and a great aioli and ketchup sauce to dip.  I gave a 4 star rating because of the food yet it was 5 star customer service.  Thank you Johneilia, fantastic server!"}
{"text":"Above average but not as good as their Neapolitan pizza counterparts in Toronto mainly due to their flavourless dough. If that improves, so too will my rating!"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and I was definitely not disappointed!  The crust can make or break a pizza and I love that the crust has a slightly chewy texture to it.  You can also order your pizza well done but it was so good as is I'm not sure I'd change anything!  We ordered and shared several different kinds of pizza for variety.  Unfortunately, the menu states that you can't ask for substitutions to their pizzas, which is a shame because I found that I disagreed with some of their combinations.  You can, of course, create your own pizza but the cost of the toppings might add up.  We ordered the chicken, slow and low, hedge hog, and tsunami pies.  The only one I wasn't a fan of was the chicken pie mostly due to the copious amounts of arugula on top.  The balsamic glaze was also a bit too overpowering for such a delicate pizza.  Overall, I very much enjoyed 3 of the 4 pizzas.  The toppings are of high quality and I love the texture that the wood fired oven gives the pizzas.  You're paying good money ($16.50 for premium pizzas, about the size of a medium pizza) but definitely worth it once in a while.  If I'm in the area I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place isn't a restaurant that can manage large parties.   During thanksgiving last year, our friends and I celebrated my husbands birthday. We made reservations think it would be busy being a long weekend (it was empty, maybe 3 small groups of people and then our party of 13)  We did the all you can eat group menu. In this, you get a set menu of appies, salad, pizza... We got the one that was $19/person.  WORST DECISION EVER!!! Here is why: -food came out in tiny portions. You can't server a group of 13 people 10 chicken wings... -food comes out in some stupid, ridiculous order... first salad, then some shitty rice balls, then wings, -because their portions were so small, we had to constantly reorder the same dish over again so that everyone would get. Some of us didnt care for the salad or wings because we wanted pizza  When we ordered these, the server would bring them out like 15-20 minutes later. We literally had to wait for our food.  -people just wanted pizza... when my husband asked the waitress about when we can order pizza, she kept brushing him off, at one point she said \"relax you will get your pizza\" IM SORRY ... WHAT DID YOU SAYYY??? -buy the time pizza time came, everyone was full or just turned off.  We were there for 3 hours.... and then we got pizza. 2 guests had to leave mid way through because the main course took took long and they had a 3 month old to tend to.   Then I asked the waitress why the service was shit and why it took 15 minutes to get us cutlery.. she said \"its a long weekend and i was the only one that didn't call in sick\" Omg i was laughing inside...! When I looked around, she and 1 more person were the only staff around aside from the kitchen staff...   Anyways overall the service sucked... their pizza... isn't the best.. there is better in Woodbridge. Their stuff ate miserable... literally... Their preset menu is also something i think you should avoid... just order off the menu  I called the next few days to file a complaint, but never got a call back. I left messages with various people on the phone and requested that the owner or manager or someone with authority call back but no one did.   I've just crossed it off my list, and if people come to Woodbridge for good pizza, I never recommend Pie..."}
{"text":"The pizza is ok. The place is a ghost town on a Wednesday, yet service is crappy with nobody to serve."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner on a Wednesday night. Finally! Dying to eat their pie.  The restaurant is nice and roomy, with very comfortable, spacious booths, good level of softer overall lighting with slightly brighter lighting over your table to see your meal, and a casual but distinct brand of decor. Shame on me for not taking pictures! The franchise logo and cute innuendo slogans are nicely incorporated into the space and dining accoutrements. The menus are cleverly displayed under the clear tabletop layer so you can see them the moment you sit down and they're always in front of you, defended from dining disasters.  There are daily After 8 PM specials according to the day of the week, which are promotional pricing for a drink that also comes with a free Kobi 62 (basic cheese) pie. Wednesday happened to be the After 8 Red Wine so we ordered one of those. I wish I could remember exactly how many ounces there were but it was a very generous serving for $11.75. The server was super nice and asked whether we'd like to have the extra pie tabulated and made later separately to take home with us if we weren't planning to eat 3 of them during our dinner sitting. For anyone who can eat 3 of those pies in one sitting, there's a Homer Simpson-style challenge where you can get the monster $35 Furious Canucker pie for free if you can finish it in 35 minutes.  We settled on one Hedgehog and one classic Pepperoni for our dinner choices. I wanted the Hedgehog for the spicy hot pepper puree that goes with the base tomato sauce, plus the spicy salami and sausage to go with the pepperoni. Most of the pies use fresh basil, and many of them have \"upgrade\" versions which use fresh mozzarella in addition to (or instead of) regular. BF took the regular Pepperoni pie with regular tomato sauce, regular mozzarella and basil, as opposed to the Pepperoni Plus which adds fresh mozzarella and uses maple chili glaze instead of basil.  These pizzas are fantastic! The crust is beautifully cooked to crispy perfection in the wood oven. You can ask for how well done you want it cooked. The tomato sauce is really good - it tastes like one of your Italian relative's house made stuff (as in, made from fresh tomatoes by the bushels in the garage-production process), and the fresh basil is such an important improvement when it comes to making a pizza taste authentic.   For some of the pies, including my Hedgehog, you have a garlic aioli topping. The server asked whether I wanted that on the side or not at all, and I kinda wish I had taken one of those two options instead. I have to say, the garlic aioli did a lot more to detract from the overall delicious authenticity of the pizza, than add flavour. It was far too close to the packets of garlic sauce that taste nothing you'd ever get in a pizzeria in Italy. Also, the pizzas were just that little bit too salty, which further added to (or should I say, detracted from) the authentic Italian taste of the pizzas. Those were the only reasons I decided to rate 4 stars instead of 5, and maybe I would say it's 4.5 anyway. The wine wasn't particularly impressive either but then it's for casual pizza dinner, so it didn't really impact so much as the Western-level fast-food saltiness taste and the un-Italian tasting aioli. The only other glitch was the mineral water that arrived instead of our Sprite order. Turned out the soda fountain had some issues but nothing unforgivable in a busy restaurant. Again, the server was super nice, tried a second time, and didn't need to be asked not to add it to the bill.  I'll say 4.5 since there are extra really great details like the nice paper-lined serving tray to cut your pizza yourself with your own pizza cutter, and the selection of 4 or 5 additional condiments (including hot sauce, and a wonderfully hot and tasty pepper oil bottled in miniature Mexican beer bottles) to dip your crust in to enjoy to the last crumb.  Really looking forward to returning and enjoying other smokin' wood fired selections on the menu. By far one of the most enjoyable dining experiences in the neighbourhood, right down to the smiley on the receipt!"}
{"text":"When we arrived at 1 p.m., I was surprised that there weren't very many guests inside.  I was expecting this place to be brimming with people on a Saturday afternoon.  We were seated right away.  Our server was very cheery and friendly.  She made sure we were fine throughout the visit and didn't interrupt unnecessarily.  It took a little bit of time for the food to arrive, around 30 minutes, (which I was surprised about because apparently each pizza only takes about 90 seconds in their Italy-imported oven to be fired up so I thought the food would have come out way sooner).  Our Spinach and Arugula Salad arrived first.    It had pears, walnuts, blue cheese, and balsamic vinaigrette.  It was a good salad!  We ordered the regular sizes of the wood fired pizzas instead of the lunch portions.  The Clamtastic Pie stood out to me.  It had a cheese sauce base, garlic butter, clams, double smoked bacon, and Parmesan.  I found that the ingredients on this pie were placed a bit haphazardly meaning that there were some parts of the pizza that were devoid of bacon slices.  I liked it though and especially the cheese sauce base and garlic butter.  The bottom of the Clamtastic Pie was a bit more burnt than the Green Egg and Ham Pie though.  The Green Egg and Ham Pie had a pesto base (not often that a pizza has that), fresh mozzarella, Parmesan, bacon, roasted potato, spinach, and egg.  This was a more colourful pizza pie.  The roasted potatoes were a bit spicy.  I liked the flavours as they were more strong than the Clamtastic Pie.  The poached egg in the middle was good as well.  The pizzas came with an old school pizza cutter -- I haven't seen one of those at the table in a while!  While it made the experience of cutting the pizzas up yourself fun, it was slightly difficult to cut the pizzas because the pizza cutter blade wasn't very sharp.  I liked the names of the pizza pies; they were quite unique.  If this place was closer to me, I might find myself here more often to have pizzas.  There aren't too many pizza-exclusive restaurants other than the fast food ones like Pizza Pizza or Dominos."}
{"text":"Place is closed.  See photos for proof -- all the signage is gone, and there's a note on the door saying they \"moved\" to Woodbridge - a bald-faced lie as their website (as of Feb 17) still lists both Woodbridge and Pickering on their list of locations.  Closure also announced on their Facebook page  https://www.facebook.com/piepickering/  Not that I'm surprised. Any restaurant that has to rely on WagJags and/or Groupons to get customers in (and does so for an extended period of time) is not going to last for very long."}
{"text":"First time experience with a group of 6 people and I !  FOOD: We personally enjoyed their salted-balls in their starter section! It was salty dough with bacon bites and shredded cheese that came with a delicious dipping sauce that balanced out the salty taste, which made it soooo good!   Pizza on the other hand, was pretty standard to me and I feel like I've had better pizza. Their mac & cheese was delicious and light but wasn't warm enough so we kindly asked the server to bring it back to the kitchen and warm it up for us. We also tried the fettuccine which was also pretty average and not too special.   Adding on, if you're planning to go with a group and want to try out a variety of their dishes, I'd suggest ordering FAMILY SIZE! It's only about $3 more than the original cost of the dish and the portions are big enough for a party of 7 people (unless y'all can eat more than us).   PLACE: Overall place was beautiful that had comfy seats and a retro vibe to it.   Customer service: The staff was very friendly, welcoming, and accommodating."}
{"text":"Two words: Salty Balls. Those are all I'd come back for because besides that everything else is just bad. Service is Bad (aside from the hostess, she was nice). Pizza was meh, but the price you pay for it is definitely not worth it. I'd pick Pizza Pizza over this place any day.  Side note: If the service was good there is no doubt that I'd give this place four stars, but that was the worse part about the whole experience. Our server was never there and trying to ask for something as simple as a hot sauce was nearly impossible."}
{"text":"If you check out You Gotta Eat Here. Their Green Eggs & Ham pizza was showcased.  I might try that one next time.   Current count for the Canucker. 19 tries with no winners. Triple stacked pizza covered with 1 lbs of poutine.  Quite the challenge for 35 mins."}
{"text":"Average.  Our waiter wasn't very informative. We didn't know how big the pizzas were so we just ordered one. The menus are on the tables. I thought that was cool. The caesar drink I ordered wasn't good. Tasted watered down.   I liked the thin crust pizza. I liked that they offer Whole Wheat and Gluten Free crusts. I liked that they offered different kinds of pizzas. The sauce wasn't your typical sauce. We felt full after eating, but not bursting. Total for 2 drinks and 1 pizza was $33 & change with tax.  One weird thing, as we were walking out, a server (not ours) gave me a dirty look. My boyfriend even noticed it. No idea what that was about. We left puzzled."}
{"text":"After watching You Gotta Eat Here, I discovered about this pizza joint. However the original location was rather far for me as a Torontonian. Back to this location. It's well lit, well ventilated and friendly staff. I like how they laminated the menu onto the table. Pretty smart move.   Onto the food. I came here with my friends and we each ordered a \"pie\". Their choices aren't traditional pizza at all. Ingredients are fresh. The pizza crust is thin. I gotten a green egg and ham, this reminded me of breakfast on a pizza: egg, bacon, potato hash, spinach, and cheese. It was tasty and not too salty. I like the flavour a lot. My friends ordered the slow and low, tsunami, and hind leg. These were all tasty too as we decided to share our pies.   I will come back again and try other flavours as I had my eye on the pork pie."}
{"text":"Ate here when taking a mid-Dave and Busters break. Loved the concept of the 900 degrees in 90 seconds\" pizza makin'. Personal sized thin crust pizzas that taste great. Can't ask for more. Their pies are worth the prices! They dont cheap out on the ingredients.  The only reason I deducted a star was because a friend found an olive pit in their salad and almost cracked their tooth (thankfully did not), but the server didnt make a fuss about bringing out a fresh one."}
{"text":"If anyone has ever dined in Woodbridge i'm sure you know that there is no shortage of pizza places in that area.  Lets add Pie to the list.  When it comes to pizza there are about a million different combinations of topping that you can put on it.  Pie's choices of pizzas are different yet tasteful.  We went on a Saturday night which according to the wait staff was a slower than usual Saturday.  The service was very slow and our waitress was very forgetful having to ask for certain items a few times before we would actually get what we asked for but our drinks were always topped up quickly.  The appetizers came out fairly quickly.  We ordered the fried calamari and the salty balls.  The portions were huge and more than enough for 4 people.  The waitress tells us that the pizza is cooked for 90 seconds.  Funny how the place wasn't that busy yet it took half hour to get our pizza.  When the pizza's came out they were super hot and a perfect size.  My pizza was dripping in oil but I am sure its the pizza that I ordered because the others were fine.  In the end we were all satisfied.  Although Pie wont be my first choice I will not cancel it out of my go to restaurants as there are many other items on the menu that I would like to try and I really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm surprised with the 4 star rating because almost everything was lacklustre, maybe we went on an off day. My experience overall is a 2.5 *.  I called ahead to make reservations for my cousins and I. We were a group of 7 (6 adults and one child). From the time we arrived at 6pm and ordered, the restaurant wasn't busy but over the course of our meal, the restaurant filled up.   We ordered the salty balls, O.G pizza, family sized fettuccini and family sized Mac n cheese to share. The salty balls came out first and were piping hot. The garlic aioli complimented the balls really well and that dish was a hit with everyone. Everything else just went downhill from there. The Mac n cheese was good, it was very cheesy and Parmesan was also used which gave the dish a nice flavour. The fettuccini was good too and didn't taste heavy. The only bad thing was the pastas came out lukewarm and we asked our server if she can reheat it for us, which she did but even after reheating, the dish was only slightly warmer than before. The pizza was good but nothing special.   In hindsight I feel like we should've ordered a couple pizzas to share and forgo the pasta dishes completely."}
{"text":"Hi.  If someone gave me a wood fired pizza and an oven fired pizza, I would've been clueless.  Here's my experience at PIE. It was not special and not in accord with the rave reviews. Perhaps my taste buds have evolved. Perhaps my palette was set to level 100.  Here's a secret I've kept for years. I can distinguish good pizza from amazing pizza. Sadly, this review will not be one as sweet as pie.  Here's what I liked. The toppings we very fresh and packed a punch of flavor. Fist-full of cheese covered the pie, leaving no patch of red.   Here's what I didn't like - the dry, thin crusted pizza that was presented. In my dictionary, Pie is not synonymous with Thin Crust. Bland, Boring and Blah is how I'll describe the pizza (not toppings) itself.  I was expecting something more yeasty and full of gluten.  Again, I have to highlight that this pizza was not bad. With a price point of $15 for a ~12\" pepperoni, I hold you to a higher standard.  My name is Dave, and I'm a pizza connoisseur.  Goodbye."}
{"text":"This place is really good, but I will say this ahead of time: absolute gut bomb. Which is why it's 4/5.  My favorite dishes are the salty balls (that aioli is the good stuff, and the greens are actually worth eating), the stinky pie with goat cheese instead of blue cheese (which means it's not stinky, but you'll live), the green egg and ham pie, and the clamtastic pie.  All of these are definitely topping-heavy, but they're well-composed (love the balsamic, love the egg, love the cheese sauce respectively) and executed nicely. I do feel that the ingredients are good quality and the price is worthwhile. The crust is especially good! Thin and just chewy enough.  I don't really like their pulled pork or beef - just not flavorful or really good texture-wise - and their pasta dishes are inconsistent (spaghetti bolognese is spectacularly hearty, mac and cheese sucks). But overall, really good food."}
{"text":"Brother ordered take outs from here tonight. Love their specialty wings, it's meaty and the flavour is just right. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza joint.  Worth a try even with living in Woodbridge being taken into account."}
{"text":"Ordered yukon fries and porky pizza, fries were okay. Pizza was soggy with one small piece of basil leaf in the centre."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday night and it was pretty empty, which is even better!!! Get to eat my pizza faster!! There's a great selection of pizzas to choose from, and it was hard just choosing one!!   We got the green eggs and ham, the crust was perfectly thin and had a Smokey taste. Nice and warm, and the fun part was we got to cut the pizza ourselves. We also ordered fresh cut fries with garlic aioli and Smokey ketchup. It was such a large portion, on a bed of arugula. The garlic aioli was omg! So good!!!! Didn't have enough for the large serving of fries!   The service was really friendly, we took our time to read the menu, and was never pressured to quickly order!   Definitely must come again when I'm in the area to try other pizzas!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place  Been there a few times  Have had several different pies  Porky Pie is def my #1 fav  Cow Pie follows this up  Have also had the St. Lucia and it's good as well  Meatball sliders are a nice starter  Have also had the sweet balls and nice treat after dinner  YGEH was not wrong at all bout this place  But recently.....found out that they are now closed!!!!  I went their in December only to find out their dough machine wasn't working and that meant no pizza!!!!  Then to our demise.....all of sudden we see that it has now closed down in February   Such a disappointment  Guess will have to go to the Vaughan location now"}
{"text":"Their pizza is nothing short of amazing. We ordered Veggilante Pie and Beauty Pie  and the Veggilante definitely stole the show, I loved the large pieces of roasted garlic and pesto on it. The service is swift and our server was super polite and friendly as well. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"For international PI day on March 14, my BF and I came here! Omgg their promotion is really cool. With 3 dice if you rolled 314 you get $100 gift card, the second time you get your pizza for $3.14! I didn't think it was possible. But omg I rolled 314 on my second try! And we actually got our pizza for $3.14! Pretty neat!   Anyways back to the pizza!  We got the St. Lucia Pie: Tomato sauce base, mozzarella, pineapple and double smoked bacon topped with shredded coconut and basil. I also got the garlic aioli! At first I thought my BF was crazy. Coconut shredding on a pizza it's not heard of... but you know what... this pizza was really yummy! The base was not over powering and wasn't overloaded. The crust and the base was thin, the dough was cooked perfectly. So hot when we got it. Omg the cheese was so melty and stringy. The pineapple gave a sweet touch, the bacon a savoury delicious end and the shredding of coconut actually was a nice chew. It didn't make the pizza taste weird as I thought it would. It was subtle! I actually enjoyed this pizza!   Chicken Wings Wood Fired: Topped with lemon, rosemary, local honey, with blue cheese dip and slaw. I loved that it was paired with blue cheese dip, which gave the wings a pop. But in general the wings we okay. The flavours we good but I wasn't wowed.   Staff was friendly, the restaurant was clean and nicely spaced and decorated, the washrooms are clean and I love how you can see the wooden over as they make pizzas. Over all I enjoyed this place and I will come back to try more of their pizza flavours."}
{"text":"Never tried out this franchise before.  The wait staff was delightful and informative. The menu was wide-ranging but concise.  My two biggest complaints are the crust not being crispy enough in the middle of the pie, and when I read \"hot pepper puree\" I expect some serious heat which was not the case.  Desserts were solid. Fries were delicious. Meatball sliders were tasty but lacking in depth. The draught beer selection was small but all winners.  I'd return and I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"Just picked this location for Friday dinner with cousin's. No research, no nothing, just random google maps search and picked whatever came close to us. Nicely faded signage along with light scent of woods greeted us, oh John, our expectation somehow hit sky high! Well, it took unusually long considering the restaurant was super quite, three tables only. It's okay, we are starving and don't mind chewing the doors. I was a bit surprised there's absolutely no introduction to the menu, portion size nor special. Well, we are first timer here and all that good sense of naming the products could've delivered with some description. It took 3-4 other visits to find out how large was the pizza (now I know, 12\") Seriously, I didn't expect being asked for beverage ordering within 3 minutes of seating (we were seriously busy deciphering the menu items, servers will only answer the question you ask, she will never take a step further!) Alight alright, after going over with 14000605 chances of having greatest experience ever in this unknown place in good 15 minutes since the seating, we finally found only one solution to this end game. Meatball and 2 pizzas!! Lovely presentation and great tasting pizzas! Please note that I really admire the amazing topping combination of this place. This part deserve applause. They are seriously well balanced, especially under the wooden oven setting. I am a bit doubtful about the dough, I did have better ones many times. Ah, the slider? Yes, slider did contribute to losing 2 marks solely because of the meatball that has frozen-rubber-like texture. (For those who wonder if I even know what it's like? I did try chew frozen rubber when I was back in HS :p) PRO TIP: no frills does have better meatballs. Then why 1 star? I almost forgot to mention. Service has lost another two here although I often give out 5 stars to the restaurants where the definition of the service is non-existence. These guys actually had amazing foods that blows mind. Once again, the place only had 3 tables when we got in and 2 tables when we left. I see absolutely no reasons to be urged for a bill, literally when I was still working on my $20, 12\" pizza."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Pizza was cold.  Don't rush to go.  They aren't in a rush to provide you with a good experience."}
{"text":"This place although I came in when it was empty, seems like an amazing place to sit with friends and share different pizzas and after tasting it? I am definitely coming back. Had the Pepperoni Plus Pie and it was so good, the mozzarella was sooooo cheesy and hot, the original taste of the pepperoni along with the drizzle of maple glaze adding in a hint of sweetness made it amazing. I havent had pizza in months and this definetly hit the spot."}
{"text":"I had a feeling that this place would have some great pizza and I was right!  They serve some rediculously great combinations of toppings on your pizza. Who would have thought that clams on a pizza would be so magical? This pizza is a must try! In my opinion, any pizza you order here will be fantastic. Plus 9 inch pizzas are only $9 for lunch(11:30am-3:00pm)!  In addition to the pizza, we tried the spaghetti and meatballs. Unfortunately they did not deliver the same satisfaction the pizza did. The meatballs we're luke warm and dense. Not the best I've ever had, but not the worst.   Pie also offers a great deal/food challenge! $44 for 3 pepperoni, bacon, and egg pizzas and 1lb of poutine. If you can eat all this yourself in under 35 minutes, you get it free. Otherwise share this combo for an amazing night out!"}
{"text":"First time here yesterday. What caught my eye was the wood fired oven. Brought them whole family and we got to try a few different pies. All of them were great. Their lunch specials are 10\" pies for $10. Can't really beat those. The regular size pies are 12\" and the different recipes they came up with are amazing. Also, the wood fired wings are a treat. Just wish they had more flavors on those. The sweet one they have are decent, but surely not everyone's favorite. They need to open up the flavors.  All in all, great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Very good!! Would definitely come back tontrybthe rest of the menu.  We had the calamari and st.Lucia Pie"}
{"text":"Service was pretty awful, and the pizzas were pretty basic. Got ignored by the waitress for the majority of the time we were there and received a pretty mediocre pizza after waiting for so long to place our orders and receive them. I had the Caper Crusader. It could have been a great pizza, but it was just so unbelievably sloppily made with way TOO MANY CAPERS!!! I wish I had sent it back and asked the individual that created it, to try a slice. Once I picked off most of the capers it wasn't as awful. 100% certain I won't be back."}
{"text":"Mmmm the Nutty Pie is delicious ! The cinnamon sprinkled on the ice cream adds an even greater delicious taste.  Such a yummy dessert.  You guys do put too much Nutella though. We had to take some off to not regret eating too much sugar.   I haven't tried your pizzas yet, but I can tell from your dough with the Nutty Pie, the pizzas must be amazing!  I can't wait to come back to enjoy your pizza and even the pasta looks yummy!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free pizzas had a poor dough-to-topping ratio thanks to a thick and doughy crust.  It was quite tasty (albeit expensive) but needed more sauce!  If I go back I'll be sure to ask and report back on that.    Anyone who eats gluten-free pizzas knows that GF pizzas are almost universally thin crust, so if you're craving some thick crust pizza be sure to visit at least once!  The service was adequate for what was a slow Sunday afternoon, and the waitress was quite helpful in making recommendations."}
{"text":"Came here just before closing and a friendly waitress greeted us. Since they were almost at closing time, we decided to do take out. The options for pizza were pretty good but we settled for the classic pepperoni and cheese.  Wait time was minimal and the place was clean  Our pizza did not live up to the hype to be honest. It was uncooked, barely any pepperoni and the cheese was so salty. Not sure if it was a bad night but the pizza simply made us want to grab a slice from somewhere else.   It was a pizza pizza kind of looking pie with an overpriced tag.   Don't think we will be going back there for wood burning oven pizza."}
{"text":"Really cool place to check out. My first time was quick on a Sunday afternoon. I got the pizza dough balls and also the meaty pizza. The pizza comes out very fast and service is great. Definitely not your regular pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.  I was in town from Chicago and was looking for somewhere to grab something to eat on a Sunday night.  This place was great.  Yes it looks like a restaurant in a strip mall but the pizza was amazing.  It is sometimes hard to find good pizza when you are a Chicago pizza snob - but this wood fired pizza was great.  I got the Fun Guy Pie.  I wanted to switch the sauce but my waitress recommended that you should stick with \"as is\" on the menu (aka no substitutions) and I am very glad that I listened to her.  I ate the entire pizza!  I also got the Warm Olives appetizer - which was very good the olives, artichokes and peppers were perfectly flavored and the bread was very crisp and seasoned well.  I wish there was a local Pie Wood in the area when I got home!"}
{"text":"Great place,  friendly and very much like their Barrie location.  Don't get the calamari as that kinda sucked.  small portion too.  but the pizzas were awesome."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid \"meh\".  The place itself looks nice, the staff are friendly and the service is good, but the pizza was quite honestly forgettable. It was certainly better than your average chain delivery pizza joint being wood-fired and all, but for the price, I just wasn't all that impressed. The sauce was flat tasting, the crush charred more than I expected, and it just wasn't a meal I walked away from amazed.  That said, I'm willing to try it once more to see if it was an off day. They've got the basic idea right, maybe it just needs tweaking."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Pie yesterday (Family Day 2018) with another couple. We have an almost 7 month old and it is a baby friendly environment. They have high chairs and booster seats. Atmosphere was good, nice and relaxed. Service was great and didn't wait long for our food. Between the 4 of us, we were very satisfied with the Spaghetti & Meatballs, Hedge Hog Pie and St Lucia Pie but if you want to try something different, try the Green Egg and Ham Pie. We were pleasantly surprised! The lemonade was light and refreshing, not tart at all. We will be back to try the other pies on the menu! (Oops I forgot to take photos!)"}
{"text":"We craved pizza one evening and there was a fabulous Order The Yelp deal from PIE.  We figured the pizzas had to be good here, because PIE had a 4-star rating in a neighbourhood where there are a lot of Italians.  And bingo! Researching on Yelp is our friend. The Yelp pizza (Pizz-eh) was excellent.  We loved the thin crust.  It had the right \"thinness\", as in not so thin that it felt like a cardboard, and not so thick that it stuffed you up in one slice. There was a slight burnt taste on a few spots on the rim.  This added a dimension to the flavour.  The tomato sauce base was excellent in both flavour and texture.  The cheese was just right. And most of all, our waitress was friendly, polite, effective and efficient. Boy, I wish I remember her name so I could give her proper recognition in the review.  The Pizz-eh was loaded with mushroom, bacon and pepperoni. PIE was not skim on good ingredients.  My BF found the pizza a bit salty, to which I countered, you asked for pepperoni, didn't you?"}
{"text":"Love the Green egg and Ham, can't find it anywhere else :) we had a great dine there!"}
{"text":"I have to lead with this DO NOT GET THE CALAMARI! It is chewy, the breading falls right off, totally oily (I think this had to do with the temperature of the fryer) and over priced for 14 dollars. We were really scared the rest of our meal wasn't going to be good but we were impressed after.  Now, for the good. We got the spaghetti and meatballs which had a lovely sauce. The meatballs are more like meatloaf balls if that makes sense but definitely excellent flavour. Pasta was cooked perfectly as well.   Second we got the hedgehog pie. It had garlic aioli on the top and it was amazing. Service was not bad as well.  Honestly, just stay clear of the calamari but everything is great from what I've had."}
{"text":"I was not expecting a pizza to be this good!!  (Well, partially due to I was not a pizza fan to begin with, so my review may not be as critical, just a heads up :p)  But the pizza from this place definitely changed my taste preference and view towards Italian freshly made pizzas!!  We came for company lunch, all of us ordered different pizza pie. I had \"slow and low\", which turned out to be my favourite amongst all. It's mixed with BBQ sauce n pulled pork, what can possibly beat that!! The pie is thin and crispy, the topping (at least mine) did not soak the pie nor made it mushy, so the combination flavour was a perfect touch in my mouth.  I will definitely return for the same pie more often, and hoping for consistencies in the perfect slow and low pizza every time!!  Good work!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to the official grand opening on March 1st around 5pm. Our service was very fast we were seated quickly, Server came over to the table as we sat down asked us what wanted to drink. we got are drinks and appetizers which came out very fast as well, we ordered The Salty Balls as are appetizer very good, after some time we ordered our pie's. I got the Porky Pie my girlfriend ordered the Hind Leg.  She said hers coulda been a tad hotter but was still edible, after are meal we got the Nutty Pie dessert pie very good but very messy need extra napkins, they have certain alcohol drinks for $6 but are very small so be warned  All in all a great place to go for dinner friendly servers good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great food for the prices, so filling!! Interior is bland -similar to boston pizza. Lots of yummy options!"}
{"text":"While the front of the restaurant didn't give give a great first impression, once we walked in and smelled that wood fire oven we were believers! The food and service was great, the ambiance is casual and relaxed. Lots of options for pizza and apps, can't wait to come back and try more. We had the St Lucia which is surprisingly great with the coconut and the Hind Leg that reminded us of Italy. This is definitely a diamond in the rough!"}
{"text":"Lunch on a Saturday at this joint was empty. The whole restaurant I would say was only 5% filled. Not busy at all. I as hoping the Yelp check in would give me the promotion but upon arrival the waitress said that promo code Was expired since June. It's August now... they really need to update that.  Over all food was okay. The \"pie\" or pizza was good in size . The regular size can feed 2 ppl. I ordered the porky pie and it was good. A bit oily and the whole pie was a bit too salty for my taste but it was ok. Service was fast since no one was at he restaurant.  They have lunch deals $9 for a smaller size pizza.   Over all I would still come back if I was in the area but wouldn't make the trip."}
{"text":"Arrived on a Friday night seeing the Order the Yelp link was active a day early - but it was not accepted. Worth a try anyway.  My 12 year old kid was a bit miffed at being given crayons.  Ordered a few things with lots of leftovers to bring home: Sweaty balls - humorous and delicious. Piping hot and arrived quickly. Whoops, my kid just corrected me. They are called salty balls. Now my kid has shared loudly and anyone in earshot is cracking up. Mac and Cheese - within two bites my kid declared the adult sized fish far too rich and would not eat any more. It was very rich, which some people would like. St Lucia Pie - toasted coconut on the side. This was a standout. We ate 2/3 of it and I loved the roasted coconut with the pineapple.  Our server was very helpful with an egg allergy.  This is a colorful space with comfy booths."}
{"text":"Meh. There's nothing special about this place. The hostess was nice, but our server was rude and was never around when we needed service. The table was sticky and my pizza was salty."}
{"text":"This place probably has one of the best garlic bread with cheese in town. We had the veggie pizza and it had a lot of flavour. However I would ask for well done since half the toppings slide right off the pizza when served. The wait time once ordered felt like a long while and it was only 5% busy. So that kind of threw me off. Otherwise a great place to go if you're in the mood for good flavourful pizza!"}
{"text":"Saturday after 8 pm, the place is packed, We got a table very quick. We ordered two pies, the food came out in under 10 min. I love this place, the pizzas are soooo good and everything under $40."}
{"text":"This place is okay. It's nothing special. The pizza is overpriced and it was burnt at the edges which I didn't appreciate. We got the all meat pizza and the topping were great but because the crust was charred, it ruined the overall pizza. Wouldn't come back and I'll just go to pizza Nova for tried and true takeout pizza We paid a lot for the calamari and it was a few measly thin pieces. So that also added to our disappointment."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the yelp event at Wood Fried Pizza Joint last night Sept 12, 2017. It was a plus one guest so my partner got to experience it as well.  Our host/community Manager, Kris, was very interactive with all the guests and put up a great event (as usual). Thank you Kris!  We tried few beers and lagers and I liked them all. All the servers were happy, helpful and interactive.  As for he pizzas, I liked them, the toppings were different, it wasn't the regular flavors, Good fusion of meats, veggies and salad on the pizza. The appetizers (calamari and risotto balls) and dessert were fresh, warm, very tasty.  Good job Chef!"}
{"text":"Pie serves up a variety of specialty pizzas cooked in a wood fired oven.  There are a number of different options (probably too many too chose from). The pizzas are quite large for one person so I recommend splitting a pizza and an appetizer if its two people.  I had the St. Lucia Pie - topped with pineapple, bacon, shredded coconut and basil. The shredded coconut was difficult to taste as it was drowned out by the cheese and pineapple but the pizza tasted great overall!  This location's exterior is a little older (differs significantly from the one in Collingwood) but the interior has a casual feel and is perfect to catch a sports game with large screen tvs inside."}
{"text":"I love love love pizza and had lunch today at PIE Wood Fired Pizza Joint.  I sat in the lounge area.  Depending on how hot the wood oven is, it takes less than three minutes to cook a pizza. I ordered a Pepperoni Plus Pie.  It was a delicious pizza.  It was definitely cheesy, which was fun.  The crust was soft and chewy.  The maple chili glaze was interesting but worked as occasionally I'd get tastes of sweet but with a bite.  I'd get this pizza again.  I ended up taking some home.  Remo was my server.  He was friendly and helpful and took good care of me.  It's too bad it's not closer to home."}
{"text":"I could smell the wood oven as I walked to the restaurant from my car in the parking lot. I got a Boston Pizza vibe when I walked in. Very casual with big TVs to watch sports at the bar and a dinning area which was separate. The menus were written on the table which was kinda cool because I thoroughly went though the whole menu as it was right in front of my eyes. Our server was very polite and approachable. She ended up brings me the wrong pizza but she fixed the order and remade the pizza I wanted after 5mins which was really fast! I read somewhere that their ovens cook their pizza in 90sec!   My pizza was not undercooked or burnt!  Their pizza was all quite unique and I had a hard time picking as they all seemed  delish! We also had the pastas which I was hesitant to try as I'm very picky from where I eat pasta dishes ( usually a mom and pop Italian place) but i was surprised that the two pasta dishes (penne bolognese and gnocchi with beef broth and spicy Italian sausage) were quite good!   I will return to try the other pizzas as they were very interesting."}
{"text":"For a while, it seemed like a new restaurant opened in this very spot every 6 months. But after these guys opened up and didn't close in the customary 6 month period, I figured they were doing something right.  I've visited this 3 times now and I've left satisfied every single time. Their pizzas are thin, cripsy, flavourful, and delicious! And the crust seems to be made with a special type of flour because you won't feel regret after scarfing down a whole pie to yourself."}
{"text":"Really enjoy Pie!  We have occasionally had issues of inconsistency around food quality and portions.  However overall I love this place and think its a great place to get a pizza instead of Pizza Pizza or those generic pizza places.  We have only ever done take out so not sure of the dining experience, but the place is always dead inside so that is probably saying something!  I recommend for takeout though the prices do add up very quickly."}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Food was burnt, yes the pizza and yes our chicken wings. Would I go again? No. The menu is not much variety. Things like appetizers aren't delicious you'd choose out of. The actual restaurant looked nice. The alcohol was good. That's it. You'll be let down coming here!!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for pizza the other day and decided  to eat here. We've ordered takeout from this place before and quite liked it. So as usual: The good: pizza is good: freshly made from fresh ingredients. The not so good: interior is so-so, menu is a part of your tabletop, so even after you've ordered your food it kind of sits there and makes you order more..(obviously not literally, but I think there's no valid reasoning for having a menu that is staring at you while you eat! (And you can't get rid of it. It's a part of the table cover!) Another small annonyance was not having salt and pepper at the table. Having said that, service was good: not superfast but decent and friendly.  Definitely not a bad experience but even so still has some room for further improvement."}
{"text":"Nice choice of pizza types. And it was nice they had the $9 lunch sized pizza which we could each get a different type. Lots of taste for each pizza. Decor is great. The pastas are nothing to write home about but that's obvious since this is a pizza place"}
{"text":"have driven by this location quite a bit and decided to give it a shot tonight. called them up to ask if they delivered and if they delivered to Ajax. the lady on the phone was friendly and answered yes to both questions. I was informed though that I had to go on their web site to place my order and could not just order over the phone. thought that was a bit odd have never had a place not take a order over then phone before. So off to their website i went. after deciding what i wanted then spending another 10- 15 mins trying to find a link so I could order this pie I called back and was then directed to go to just eat to place my order. the just eat website was pretty easy to navigate and placed my order. after a hour had gone by with no pizza I called back it had been 1 1/2 hrs since trying to order a simple pizza. I was informed that their machine was unplugged really guys ? For a place that wont take orders over the phone you would think that they would make sure their systems are working. In the end totally frustrated i just called pizza nova instead."}
{"text":"On a warm fall evening was in the mood for some pizza on a Friday night. Not really willing to try the regular chain pizza places in Durham, i remembered this place that I would drive by on occasion.  The Pie in Pickering i feel is a welcome addition to Durham region. We went on a Friday night, and it was packed! The wait wasn't long at all.  Soon enough we had our seats, and i personally liked the touch of having the menus written on the table.  The pizza was really good, nice thin crust, and very flavourful. I had the Green Eggs and Ham. It was excellent. The service was really good, and I liked the 80's videos that were playing on the TV's.  Good place for a family dinner. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Oh man.....  Long story short, I had been to a bunch of shitty weddings recently and was craving a good italian wedding meal.  You know, tons of food and stuff,.... But with no more weddings in sight, what would I do?  I met up with 10 of my friends at Pie. It was my first time, but my friend told me about this endless meal thing that they have where they bring you a bunch of food All you can eat style.  All for about 30 bucks a head tax and tip included. Couldnt be true.  So we ordered it.   First comes salad, then comes these pizza dough balls of goodness. Not bad for a start!  Then comes Coldcuts and cheese, Oh wow ok.  Then comes Chicken wings! We ordered extras of those. THEN comes two types of delicious pasta.  THEN comes about 8 pizzas.....  It felt like that amazing italian wedding that I had been hoping for....But at a ridiculously cheap price.... I sat there and felt guilty.....  Wow... Just great!"}
{"text":"Food- this is about the third time coming to this location. Came here with 3 other friends and split an appetizer and 3 pizzas which were a perfect portion. We ordered the duck pizza, the hog, and sweet & spicy (in order from most liked). Overall I would say that the pizzas were very unique, cooked to a unique crisp and fresh.   I would say the pizza was a little small to share, crust was a little burnt to the edges and the flavour ratio between the sweet & spicy was not a fan fave. Hot sauce and sauce collection could use improvement. Consistently needs improvement.    Service- The pizzas took a little while to get ready. Was sitting for quite a while. If we didn't order an appetizer we'd surely be starving. Waiter was busy most time, but I could see she was trying to juggle a lot. Kudos to her!   Overall better than most joints, but just okay in my books. Definitely would check it out though if you haven't had a unique pizza place yet!"}
{"text":"Just ordered takeout at this place. I ordered the Kobe pizza which was just ok. I think there's better pizza at Pizza Nova. The good thing about this pizza is that it's ready in less than five minutes, maybe that's the reason why it's just ok."}
{"text":"I'm shocked to see these positive reviews. We ordered calamari to start which had to be the most disgusting calamari I have ever tasted. We sent them back to the kitchen. All the batter was coming off and it tasted very slimy. No manager came out once the order was sent back to see what the issue was. Our server was actually the only positive part of our visit. Our pizzas were below average and we ending up throwing out the pizza that was packed up for us. I will never return to this place. A insult to Italian food."}
{"text":"The pizza is very good.  We are a little disappointed in the Cesar salad and the wait time on Friday and 2pm was longer than expected.  Like I said the pie is good especially if you have some time to spare.  Adult beverages are also pretty well priced.  I would visit again."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday. I'm usually not a pizza type of person but this was the best pizza I have tried! The service was amazing, we had a few kids running around and the waitress was super nice to them. If you want great service, great food and yummy drinks, DO come eat here!i thought we might have overstayed for a couple of hours but they did not mind and were not bothered at all. Such amazing service!"}
{"text":"In town from Detroit. Checked the reviews and thought we'd give it a shot. Not at all disappointed. Service was friendly and fun. Pizza was flavorful and cooked perfect and exactly as ordered. Will definitely be back. Also - come to Detroit!!!"}
{"text":"This place I have been eyeing while passing by quite frequently. It caught my attention although in a dingy plaza. So glad I stopped by for lunch!   This place has awesome lunch prices although I didn't order anything off of it. Also although this is a pizza joint; they do serve pastas as well. And let me tell ya; I've had a good pasta craving for AGES now and was disappointed a few weeks ago; needed a redemption. As soon as I heard everything is locally sourced and made in house INCLUDING the pasta... It HAD to be done. Fear not; I will be back to review the pizzas. I had the Pappardelle and a friend had the mac and cheese and boy were they cooked to perfection! With a good balance of noodle to sauce with the noodles perfectly cooked; I was not disappointed in the slightest. I will hands down recommend this place to anyone especially with the reasonable prices! They even have deals for large groups with are great. And the variety of pies def are appealing to try. I will definitely be back and recommend this place to others. And with friendly helpful staff; its just the icing on the cake to a good restaurant visit. Thoroughly happy."}
{"text":"Just came back from an amazing experience at Pie! My favourite food is pizza, and this Porky Pie pizza, lemme tell you I fell in a deep love affair.   It had Tomato Sauce Base, Mozzarella, Double Smoked Bacon and Sausage,Topped with Prosciutto and Basil. Killer!! Also had the calamari, and Salty Balls. The Salty Balls were great, simple but definitely made a statement, it was fried pizza dough with Parmesan, and bacon on top with a garlic aioli sauce on the side!  The food was amazing, and the service was just as amazing! Our server Sonia had a positive vibe, had our food out on time, and always took care of us! Made us feel important and she did an awesome job doing so! REGARDS TO THE CHEF!   The menus were printed onto the tables which was pretty dope! Haven't seen that before!! I loved the vibe of the place, huge TVs to watch the games, a cozy feeling makes you feel comfortable right away!  All positive vibes from this place would definitely come back again to try all the pizzas.  Thank you for the awesome experience."}
{"text":"Showed up with my family and waited 5 min with no lineup and unfortunately no staff to great us, k Went over to the bar and found the only person around who was working and again unfortunately she said seat yourself, k We took a seat and again waited 5 min, with the 2 guys making pizza and no Waite staff, k. Now that's what I call a totally F$&@ing bad experience. So owner do you think that was K??!!"}
{"text":"Wood oven pizza always has a nice char that adds to the smokiness.  The crust wasn't thick and I really liked the sticky balls. We had to get then in pairs so we had two orders. The St. Lucia with pineapple and the porky pizza was well done. It does get a little salty."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the wings app and pie pizza. We went with the hedge hog pie which had the perfect amount of spice. Will definitely come again to try the other pies."}
{"text":"Wood fire pizza are the best types of pizza and Pie does a pretty good job at it. I've had the four cheese pizza which was - dare I say it - way too cheesy, mostly because of the overpowering blue cheese. I've also had the clam pizza, which was interesting but probably something I wouldn't get again. There's so many choices that it's impossible to stick with the same one each time you come here.  Aside from the pizza, I've tried the calamari which was just so-so. Stick with the pizza!"}
{"text":"Come after 8 pm for the After 8 Special!   You can get a Stein of Sleeman or Sapporo and a Kobi Pie for $10.50! Seriously a stein of beer cost more than $10.50 in a lot of places I have been to and a pizza pie all for myself?!   This might be the best deal in town if you like drinking and pizza!  I do like my pie thin crust and PIE's pie is just perfect for me!  And make sure you end your evening with an order of NUTTY PIE: Nutella with vanilla ice cream................  Food Coma!  Maybe I can watch my Yelp friend do the Canucker eating Challenge: Triple Pizza with 1 lbs of poutine in 35 min?! I am still working on my After Eight challenge of a stein of beer and a pie in?"}
{"text":"MAMA freaking MIA, where the hell are Mario and Luigi? Seriously, this place is wonderful. Came here for the #OrdertheYelp and the Pizz-eh was fabulous. Essentially a Great Canadian Pizza with EXTRA BACON (yes bacon), and this thai-ish sauce that was the perfect combination for this pizza. Had a lot of Mushrooms, but other than that, the crust was not crunchy (that's good) and the dough was fresh. Staff was incredibly friendly and always checked-up on us throughout the meal.  Overall a quality pizza place in Vaughan, probbly the best one."}
{"text":"Went in here on a Saturday for lunch because we were looking for something different. This place is different alright. The pizzas are all thin crust, non customizable (i. e. you can't pick your toppings), and lack flavour.  Two of our pizzas had chicken on them and both tasted gross.  Bill for 4 (two adults, two kids) was around $80.  We won't be going back because this place does not offer anything better, nor compare, to chain pizza joints like Dominos."}
{"text":"Out tonight because - Kris and the Yelp team organized a YELP Event at this restaurant and it was a wonderful experience!! Thanks!!   (Somehow I couldn't post it that night....)  A section of the place was for Yelpers only. As starters, there were fried calamari and salty balls (warm and chewy).   Promoting a new soda brand, BRIO, which allowed us to taste their different flavours.   There were many different types of pizzas/pies that were self-served and each type didn't disappoint. The crust is chewy, it's thin, but full of yummy toppings! It's an open area where you can see them making the pizza and putting them in the oven.   The washroom is large and clean which is definitely a bonus.   Verdict: I would go back in the future if I'm in the Vaughn area. They also have a lunch special which is fantastic at $9."}
{"text":"We arrived in a group of 8 on a Friday evening and we were all seated promptly.  In our group, we ordered two tsunami pies, sweet balls, and mac and cheese.  The restaurant was pretty dead when we arrived so our food arrived quickly all within 15 minutes which is awesome for Wood Fired Pizza.  Our server was very friendly and made sure we were always stocked up with water or if we ever needed anything.    The two tsunami pies ($19~ each) were ordered for four people sharing and we quickly found out when the pies arrived that they were meant for individuals.  They're very small to share for a pizza unless both people sharing have a lack of appetite.  Overall, the pizzas were cooked very well in the wood fire oven and they were good; just ended quickly.  The mac & cheese and sweet balls were just okay, nothing special.  All in all, try out this place to see if you like their pies but just pass on the appetizer portion of the menu.  The pies are very unique and they have a ton to select from with unique ingredients."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim for dinner after looking at all the positive reviews on Yelp! The restaurant is pretty large, with two sections. One looks more like a sports bar while the other has tables and booths. The decor consists of televisions and posters advertising their eating contest.  The menu is helpfully posted on the table. They have many different pizzas, so it was difficult to choose. There were a few where the ingredients seemed like they just don't go well together. After some deliberation, I finally decided on the Fun Guy pizza (play on words on funghi) and the Chicken pizza. It took 20 minutes for the pizza to arrive after ordering. Both pizzas were very tasty. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients. I enjoyed the taste of the cheese mixed with the portabello mushrooms. The arugula was extremely fresh on the chicken pizza. I really enjoyed the goat cheese and the balsamic glaze. The pizzas come with a thin crust and only comes in 12 inch sizes."}
{"text":"So I arrived here with my family on a Wednesday night. There were a few tables already dining. The restaurant was pretty empty. For our appetizers, we split a couple of salads, Yukon gold fries and salty balls. The fries were good, however the salty balls tasted like fried dough with no flavour. Our meal included three pizzas and some chicken wings. Although the pizza was thin crust, it left me feeling like a swallowed a bowling ball. Even the server said that the chefs were still learning the menu.   The service was ok, however, the server kept interrupting our meal.   My wife and I will probably not return."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times due to awesome food and beer. Service has always been great! I have tried almost all the pizzas and I think slow-n-low is one of the best and unique one. :) worth trying their food and service. 5 starts all the way!"}
{"text":"The reviews from my fellow Yelpers hold true. This place makes amazing pizza.   Me and my SO walked in on a busy Friday night and were quickly seated in the bar area. The place was bumping.   We were greeted and ordered our pizzas. I ordered the Hind Leg Pie and she ordered the \"Fun guy\" pie. Literally within minutes they arrived.   ABSOLUTELY delicious. Some of the best pizza I have had outside of Italy. Ingredients were fresh and authentic. I could eat the pie dough by itself with nothing on it.   Why only 4 stars? Well, the booth we were seated in was insanely small and it made cutting the pizza and then eating the pizza very difficult. Especially with 2 drinks, 2 plates and 2 pizzas on the 2ftx2ft table. It was like having pizza in the back of a police cruiser.   However I will be definitely be back here. Simply because the pizza is unreal. An absolute must if you've never been!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5 stars because I'm being difficult.   Food - pizza, 5 star (fresh ingredients and topped perfectly) Pints, 5 star (great taste and perfect pours) Atmosphere - 5 star Service - 3 star (I attribute the low rating due to how new the place is and how young the waiters/waitresses are)  Overall, this is a great pizza joint with the potential to destroy its competitors I.e. Pizza Pizza, Puzza Hut, Dominos etc... Give the place some time to settle into itself. Be patient with the service and just enjoy your time spent there.  If you get the chance to speak to John the owner, please do. He is one of the most genuine and straight forward business/restaurant owners you will ever meet. If you ever have an issue, concern, problem then John is the man to speak to. He will bend over backwards to make sure you leave with a positive experience.  Overall experience, positive. I will be back!"}
{"text":"We had a quick lunch as this restaurant and it was very disappointing.  Menu looks great however food quality not good.  We started with the warm olives and it tasted like olives from a grocery store warmed up in a microwave.  The pizza crust was nice and thin but very bland and not what we expected.  Thumbs down on this place."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday for my boyfriends birthday, there were 20 of us so we opted to do the Ultimate Pie Party ($24 each and we got salads, some apps and endless pizzas) the food and service were both amazing. I believe Joanna was the server who took care of us and she was phenomenal. Both fast and attentive and the food was absolutely delicious and plentiful. Highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. They have a really amazing evening special of a pizza with a 32 ounce beer for a reasonable price, which is what I always get. Even better, they offer a vegan cheese which is a bit lacking in favour, but has all the meltiness of dairy cheese. The space is pretty big and has plenty of room for  big groups. Would definitely recommend."}
