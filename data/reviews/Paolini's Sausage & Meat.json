{"text":"This is one of my old man's regular haunts.  You know it's quality when the are two middle aged German women working the counter who dont really speak English.  Great selection of German cold cuts, cheeses and breads.  They have a wide selection of authentic Rye breads (some weigh like 10 lbs).  Definitely worth the trip if it's just for the double smoked bacon."}
{"text":"Paolini's is *HANDS DOWN* the best German butcher in Calgary.  I'm half-German and have tasted the \"real thing\" in Germany.  Paolini's matches the quality, taste and selection I would see in any good German deli back in Europe.  All of their sausage is made in the store - there are no Feybe or Schneider's re-packaged meats here.  Get there early on the weekend to pick up a bag of traditional German pretzel buns.  They have imports too (like coffee, candy, chocolate ... even Persil washing soap).  As an added bonus for local hunters, Paolini's does wild game butchering as well.  Last time my relatives came to visit from Germany it was 5-stars for Paolini's ... they said it's even better than their local butcher in their home village."}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit to this hidden deli. Their selection is average, nothing special, however I would have given 3-4 stars if my review was based on the products only. BUT taking their customer service in consideration (which was 1 star at its best) I couldn't give them more then 2 stars in total. Their staff seemed to have fun with regulars, not paying attention to new customers at all. They might be underpaid employees though, since I noticed they rang in 8 items for me even though I purchased 6 items only. This was an extra 10 bucks charge for nothing. I'm very disappointed. I'm not gonna be back. If you decide to give it a try I recommend to check your receipt before leaving the store."}
{"text":"One of the best \"old world recipe\"  Butcher shops in Calgary. The beef jerky is like no other I have tried. Sausages and cold cuts are amazing, marinated pork is amazing!"}
