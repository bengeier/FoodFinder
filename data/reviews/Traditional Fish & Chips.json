{"text":"Excellent fish and chips -- perfectly crispy, not soggy like those other places that don't clean their oil often enough. Friendly staff. Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Love going here because it's just what I imagine in a local fish shop....small (you can sit but it's more of a takeout place), simple, and delicious.

The tartar sauce is packaged (I always get take-out though so maybe if you sit then it's different), the portions are fairly good and the prices are cheap. The menu contains quite a bit of variety including other types of meet and it even advertises shawarmas (but there's a shawarma store a couple doors beside this I would recommend over that).

If you stick to fish though, I'd recommend the spicy fish which is a large fried fillet with a bit of a South Asian/lemon taste and I actually prefer this over their traditional haddock fish. The fries are also good (not McDonald's good but probably more natural potato than starch). The menu also contains some other interesting looking options (fish birayani which is small pieces of fried fish with rice). Service is fairly quick because it's usually never busy, I only wish that the fillet was a bit thicker but can't complain, would like to try out more items from the menu."}
{"text":"Anything but, traditional fish & chips. Oily, tough and tasteless. The batter is more like frozen supermarket than English beer batter.
Not recommended."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! I ordered the fish fillet it was crispy and delicious. The spicy fries tasted great also. I had to wait for a long time but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not one to give low ratings because I like to give restaurants a second or third chance depending on the reasons I didn't like it or the situation I was in at the time.

In this case that's not going to happen. This place is awful from start to finish. Just skip this place, keep driving or walking whatever you are doing and move alone.

1. The prices are way to expensive to start with. 
2. After paying to much the portions you receive you will feel ripped off.
3. The food.....ok we order 4 different items just to get a nice variety. That was a horrible mistake! Waste of money.

The fish was bland and soggy as hell. The fries all soggy and the oil it was cooked in made it taste like it had never been changed. Ya! That gross taste.

The breaded shrimp ... oh man I can only write bland and soggy so much.... straight to the point for the price we paid for this go drive your butt to Red Lobster , at least you won't feel ripped off.

The last time was also fish, so to clarify it was haddock and cod fish ordered, breaded shrimp and fries.

Just save your money, there are better places than this by far."}
{"text":"~ This is about a 3.5 stars place ~

Was craving for some fish and chips so I thought to check this place out and to my surprise this wasn't that bad as they had a lot of options to choose from which didn't just include fish.

We ordered their Cod fish with spicy fries and Spicy fish with Poutine fries. The Potatoes were the winner here. We really enjoyed their spicy fries and the Poutine's gravy was really good. The spicy fish was really enjoyable but the cod fish was not the best of this world. 

They don't make their own tartar sauce  and you get the packaged version which is give out at lot of take-out joints. 

The price is reasonable, staff is friendly and service is fast. There is parking on the premises and few tables in the restaurant for seating.

They also have burgers & wraps like souvalki, zinger, sharawara...etc.

For my Muslim folks - I confirmed with the staff that they serve halal meat here."}
{"text":"WORST EVER!!! Fish was Over cooked! AND when you think of Halibut you think of a nice big thick piece of meat not here my Halibut was the size and thickness of a poptart! EW Never again! NOT to mention the mushrooms...there like over battered chicken balls totally the wrong kind of batter for mushrooms!! Yuk!"}
{"text":"i would not recommend this place to anyone. the food was tasteless. the place is small and very dirty. the owners don't seem to care at all. prices are OKAY but the food is bad."}
{"text":"Delish fish and chips but the spicy fish is hands down the best. Large menu and everything is always top notch. Been going here for years, their quality and quantity is always consistent. Really sweet and humble owners, very unpretentious atmosphere. Wait time can be long but that's only because they make everything fresh from scratch. Gotta love this place."}
{"text":"Not great. Small portion for $10 and halibut tasted too fishy. Fish was dry and tough. The place looked dirty. I should've left then, but I thought I'd give it a try. I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"Went there on a whim just cuz I was in the area looking at cars. The guy on the cash pretty friendly and recommended the spicy fish. Took a while to get the orders though. Only one guy doing cash and making the food so I can't say much but still. 

While the fish was quite tasty. The spices were a bit on the strong side in the sense they hit you just a tad. But I truly didn't like the fact that it was one not that thick, second it felt a bit on the mushy side. The veggies given with it, fresh as well as the green sauce with em. The tartar sauce was packaged which wasn't good. 

The fries get a special mention. Very nice. Thick cut. Tasty. The place itself small cozy but I'll assume more of a takeout place rather than dine in. All in all a fun experience."}
{"text":"Was wandering around the area looking for lunch when I saw the philly cheesesteak poster so I decided to give it a go. It was $5 so I was not expecting much so I order a Shawarma as well. Smelled good on the way home. 
I got home and wow, the grease! Both of them were making the paper bag clear. But the smell. oh man. 
I had the Philly first. Amazing! Everything was perfectly portioned. He said I will come back for these and he is right!
The chicken shawarma was also very good but could not beat out the philly in my opinion. 

Place itself is cosy and quiet. The man at the counter was very friendly. Will head there again next time and I am hungry and in the area."}
{"text":"Nice take out joint (they do have a small dining area but its not too inviting)
A mom and pop shop, this place has great food at competitive prices. Go with the Halibut and chips large size (this will feed two people) You may want to call ahead to place an order on weekends as it can get very busy. Have had take out here several times and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"I always like to know of a good fish and chips place near by for those occasions when a get a craving. I used to go to Caz's, but when they changed ownership, their quality wasn't as good, so I found this place and decided to try it out based on the few yelp reviews here. I'm glad that I did.  Great fish and chips in the traditional style. They are on the greasy and salty side, but then who is going out for fish and chips expecting health food?   The only downside as mentioned previously is that the tartar sauce is packaged, rather than it being there own. Other than that, it was a great place for take out."}
