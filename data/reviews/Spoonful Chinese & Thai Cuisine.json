{"text":"This place is pretty new; spare and modern inside, with kind of cramped seating.  The music was too loud & not suited to the atmosphere at all.   I ordered the vegetables with peanut sauce.  On the menu it's listed as spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all.  The veggies were cooked really well but the peanut sauce didn't taste very good.  I'm a vegetarian so my options were limited, but I'm definitely going to give this place a second chance and order a different dish.   This restaurant isn't very veggie-friendly but I bet if you ate meat you'd find a dish to enjoy."}
{"text":"I went in there wanting to have some Thai food. They are HKers trying to make Thai food, and are, IMO, generally unsuccessful at it. However....  Their Korean Beef stir fry was one of the best I've ever had! You order one or two $2 bowl of coconut rice to go with it and you have at least 2 or 3 meals of pure bliss! It's not Bulgogi but it is delicious.  In short, I think if you stick to the Chinese dishes, they can probably make something spectacular, hence their awesome reviews there. I think I'd like to go back and try their other Chinese menu items. The portions there are a bit larger than average too."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for the last 2 years and the food is always amazing but the service is lacking.  The lady who took our order this last time started arguing with us over the phone number we were calling from being different than the address she thought it was. She conceded that she might be mistaken and took our order.  45 minutes after our order was placed, she called us and said that they lost our order and wanted to confirm what we had ordered.  After retaking our order she just hung up! Didn't even tell us how long to for expect delivery.  Almost 2 hours after we placed our order, we finally received it.    I love the food here but I really am starting to question if it's worth the hassle of dealing with their service. This review would easily be a 4 or a 5 star review if they would improve their service."}
{"text":"Attempted to order $50 plus order and advised $6.00 delivery charge. Go to website and look at menu on current website which indicates free delivery on order over $25 within 5 km.  We live 4.5 km from restaurant. Mention to them advise that's an old menu, if so update it. At present false advertisement and a money grab. Thanks but no thanks, not paying that price."}
{"text":"The rice is ok. I like the skewers they have.  Ill eat there if i don't feel like leaving the hood. but right now its last resort for me... Sorry"}
{"text":"I love Spoonful, and go as often as I can, though I live on the other side of town. The combination of tasty food, friendly server, in a clean and modern space, can't be beat. My favourite dish is the scallops and asparagus in coconut sauce, but it's not on the menu so you have to ask The chicken and spinach in lemon pepper coconut sauce and veg and tofu in Malaysian curry sauce are great too. I've liked everything that I've eaten here, but not everything is as mind blowing as the scallops."}
{"text":"Twas a random Sunday night, my stomach was down for an adventure. Coming to this new place allowed my taste buds to experience a level of ecstasy that has never been reached. The waitress at this place replicates the food that is offered. A young, unique beautifully rich, Chinese, Thai infused goddess.  I now understand why this place is called spoonful, because if you eat here your spoon will be full and your stomach to follow.  In one explanation of my experience, it was like sucking on God's teet and finding yourself with the sinful pleasure of holy foods."}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant recently and since I live within a few blocks, have ordered food (takeout) several times.  The hostess / waitress is very helpful and friendly, and goes out of her way to ensure you have a great eating experience.  We have tried about 12 different dishes including some of their curried and spicy dishes of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, and vegetables.  Excellent sauces and fresh ingredients. No MSG.  I disagree with the previous comment that it is not spicy enough.  The hostess asks how spicy you want it (low, medium, high) and our household is accustomed to very spicy Latino and Asian food.  They have a varied menu and the prices are usual for this kind of restaurant.  The restaurant is very clean and comfortable.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm a neighbourhood regular at Spoonful. The food is consistently fresh and tasty and the spattering of Thai dishes keeps me from getting bored. The owner herself is often serving and the food is always hot and quick. Lucky to have such a great restaurant in Bowness."}
{"text":"Fantastic coconut soup and wonton soup. Superb service. I think we just found a new favorite."}
{"text":"These guys seriously have THE BEST deep fried won tons. My hubby and I always ge them as well as their ginger beef. Almost everything we have had here has been fantastic. Deffinitely a good little place!!!"}
{"text":"Summary - good service, decent food, but be careful what you order.    The staff was overwhelmed when we popped in, with a table of 12 hogging up all of the solo cook in the kitchen's time.  The server thoughtfully told us how long we should expect to wait while he cleared the backlog, which is great service in my book (instead of misleading you in order to retain business).  We tried the dry garlic ribs, which were yummy, but a bit salty.   We also had the lemon pepper chicken in coconut sauce, which was okay, but we wouldn't order it again.    The 3rd dish was the bbq pork in egg noodle.  It was really salty, quite spicy (which I liked), but the pork was a bit scarce.  Too noodle heavy, but I guess that's what you can expect in most restaurants of this type.  As of result of the spice (?), our stomachs were doing grumbly back flips into the early hours of the morning."}
{"text":"Love this place. It is on our list of favourite \"go to\" spots to eat. The lady who serves remembers us and the kids as well. The diced chicken was perfect and so far, we have never had a bad dish."}
{"text":"Love the fresh no MSG menu and the Chinese/Thai mix.  The pad thai is amazing...but a little warning when ordering if you love heat the medium is probably enough!  Thankfully the server warned me and stopped me from ordering the hot as the medium almost blew my top.  Everything we have ordered has been fantastic including our staple ginger beef.  Great size portions for the price.   We normally get take out or delivery."}
{"text":"My first visit to Spoonful was awesome!  Crisp veggies, sweet sauces and amazing won ton soup.  Not my experience today.  Ordered the Chinese Friday Lunch Combo and was served a bowl of soup that looked like heated soy sauce with a layer of floating grease.  Despite being only the third person in the restaurant, my friend's lunch was served 5 minutes ahead of mine - and while hers was marginally better, It was still awful.  My chicken balls were burnt - and the chop suey was so greasy that I only had a bite of it - and the beef tasted off as well.   Maybe the other dishes would be better - but would definitely warn anyone NOT to order the Lunch combo.  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I was in the area looking for some food, walked by spoonful, decided to check it out. I ordered the Wednesday lunch special. It was very good. The food portions were perfect! I'd 100% come back."}
{"text":"Owner was very friendly and polite, and never seen so much seafood in a seafood bowl in my life! (I had the seafood udon) Amazing serving size, great taste, and decent prices."}
{"text":"My Family and I have been coming here for 4 years now and it is by far our favorite place to eat. The food is always great never had a bad meal there.  The owners are wonderful, they are friendly, attentive and bend over backwards to make our meal enjoyable. Hands down this is one of the best restaurants in the city a hidden jem in Bowness."}
{"text":"I am hung over.   This place I came by randomly.   I think it just saved my soul.   I must look rough because the hostess does not seem keen on making small talk.  The food is pretty decent and quick.   The thing i love most is how clean it is.   The bathroom is clean and huge.   Place is great for groups!"}
{"text":"WE'LL BE BACK!!!  Very fresh food prepared and cooked by hands that care. Wor Wonton Soup was as good as the best I've had - SUPER fresh shrimp and very tasty Wontons.   Ginger beef was the perfect mix of crisp, sweet and spicy.   The woman who served us was very attentive and took time to genuinely find out how everything was."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken satay soup for $7.95 and the $10 Thai combo is pretty good value for the taste and generous portion size."}
{"text":"I only visited once. I had about half of a Tim Hortons cappuccino left when I went in. I sat down and started to look at the menu. I was the only guest in the whole restaurant. The server (owner?) approached me and told me I had to leave because he \"didn't know what was in the cup\" that clearly said Tim Hortons on the side. I understand that a place might not want outside food because it might negatively affect sales, but for one I only ever order water to drink when I'm at a restaurant, and two; I had planned on ordering to go. I was pretty put off by how rudely I was treated, told him it was \"no wonder the place is empty\" and vowed never to return. He acted as though I had a cupful of acid that I was going to throw at his face when really I just didn't want my cappuccino to get cold while I ordered and waited for food. As the only guest in the whole place, he could've easily let it go. But instead he treated me with disrespect (choice of words and tone of voice) and lost a customer forever."}
{"text":"Came here for a team lunch. The restaurant was chosen by one of my team members as it was his birthday. Lots of options to choose from the menu! The place is clean and big, tables can be moved to accommodate groups. We were a group of 8 people and we were the only ones there. It took a while until we finally got out food. We noticed there was only one cook and since we were the only ones there we thought they don't expect that many people for lunch hours so usually one cook would be enough? Anyway we had time to chat and enjoy our company. The food was really good and tasty, it is good value for the money. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Incredible!  My family and I are picky when it comes to fresh ingredients.  It's tough to find a good Asian restaurant, even in the United States.  I didn't realize how much Asian culture was to be found in Canada.  However, on a military move taking us from San Antonio, Texas to Fairbanks, Alaska, we stopped in Calgary on our long drive north.  I had seen all the advertisements for fancy restaurants but we were craving Chinese.  Spoonful's reviews on another website were top notch and we gave it a shot.  It wasn't far from our hotel and parking was a breeze.  It was empty inside, but very clean and tidy.  The woman (owner?) came right over and sat us.  They offered no combination plates, but did not need to; the prices were fantastic.  We ordered the beef chop suey, rainbow noodles, lemon pepper coconut milk chicken, steamed rice and spring rolls.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  The dish that blew me away was the lemon pepper coconut milk chicken.  Crazy good.  The server/owner woman greeted my two boys and gave them a puzzle to play while we waited.  She went above and beyond.  If I lived Calgary (a BEAUTIFUL city) I would no doubt come back again and again.  As it stands, that lemon pepper coconut chicken will be made over and over again in my own kitchen and I will probably never be able to replicate that melt-in-your-mouth freshness."}
{"text":"Tried to place an order for delivery 45 minutes before closing time on a Friday (6.5km delivery distance) and was told we were too far away for delivery.   Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Tom Yum King soup like no-where else.  Carefully prepared, richly spiced and no two dishes tasted the same.  I look forward to trying every dish on the menu."}
