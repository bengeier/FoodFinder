{"text":"Shrimp and broccoli is always my go to lunch. Good Chinese food here and lunch is till 3 pm and cost 4.99 for lunch specials. I've also had their General Tso chicken and sesame chicken which was pretty good. Small restaurant with just a few tables."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time, but was not impressed.  The delivery was fast, but the food was cold and didn't have a good taste."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and have always been \"off put\" by the place. I called in for a pickup and the lady taking the order sounded very annoyed. After hanging up I venture over there and the same lady didn't acknowledge me at first. I went to pay, and just as she swiped my card another customer came in asking a question about the food, something like is it too salty. The lady was clearly annoyed again and would answer with condescending logic like 'well if you order something salty then it will be salty.'  While I was waiting to pay earlier I can see the cook(s) in the back on the phone while cooking. The kitchen doesn't look very clean at all.  An earlier time I had been in there, their soda machine wasn't working and only had water in a water jug available...which was out. There weren't any drinks on there. I should've left as I was dine in that time.  Another time I was dine in, I guess the owner and his/her family decided to eat on the center table, which is cool I wouldn't care but they were staring at my wife and I the whole time (and we stared back).  And still another time we ordered delivery. I put the tip in the order online. The kid shows up and demands a tip. He takes out his phone to call the place to make sure I had put the tip in then maybe realizes he's being rude and just walks away.  Pretty sure I'm done with this place. And it would make me a happy man if I can even dissuade one other person from going there."}
{"text":"these people were caught digging produce out if the dumpster behind the grocery store it is located next to. They raise and slaughter their own chickens, and use local caught fish from the park in the fish dishes. TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUS. USE CAUTION WHEN YOU EAT HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good price?Good cook?It's a must when I go by?Also nice worker?The place never let me down ?"}
{"text":"You gotta be kidding me!! Its a big rip off, 99% rice and veggies, 1% meat, never again!!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a few years and have never been disappointed. Christmas dinner for eleven? No problem. More food than we could eat for less than seven dollars a head, including beverages."}
{"text":"I had a lunch special of Hunan Chicken yesterday. It included pork fried rice and hot and sour soup.  The Hunan Chicken was excellent, lots of chicken in a savory, hot brown sauce with broccoli, snow peas and red peppers.  The fried rice was a nice brown color with pork cubes and egg. Quite tasty. The hot and sour soup had pieces of tofu, pork strips and bamboo shoots with lots of red pepper flakes. It may not be the best I've had, but it was still good.   What a bargain for $4.95."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I like this place a lot. Call it in and they have it ready in about 10 minutes. Portions are a good size, enough for lunch the next day when I ordered the honey chicken. I recommend giving it a shot"}
{"text":"As for myself, I like this restaurant very much.  Good food, at a good price.  Of course everything has to be taken in context, this is basically a family run takeout restaurant, so one should curve expectations around that fact. Furthermore, this here is Mesa Arizona, and if you haven't noticed, we're not a major culinary center of the United States. Duh! Don't ever expect the level of cuisine one gets in New York City or San Francisco.   That said, when a place like New China opens up, I'm actually quite happy. Is it authentic? That depends on your point of view. Compared to chains like Panda Express, this restaurant is worlds better. And New York Chinatown? Well, they're not quite there, but on a scale of 1 to 10, I'm happy to give them a solid 7+. For Mesa, that's pretty darn good by my estimation."}
{"text":"Placed an order a few weeks ago they forgot my egg rolls  I called tonight which they stated they would replace the egg rolls, the order was for delivery which took two hours to get and the food was ice cold.  Now here it comes they forgot my damn egg rolls again. I called and was told they were busy offered to give a 10.00 credit next order. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. I told them to take the egg rolls and shove them where the sun doesn't shine. And then I would never ever frequent their establishment again"}
{"text":"This place has the worst Chinese food that I have ever tasted.  Stale, low quality vegetables, flavorless entrees, and way over-priced for what they serve.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Went a few times and the last visit made me sick. Definitely do not recommend... They have some sketchy stuff going on behind the restaurant that does not inspire confidence in the cleanliness of the food."}
{"text":"Cheap greasy average Chinese take out food. Can't go wrong with that. Of course there is better but I don't want to drive 25 minutes out of the way for gourmet Chinese food. They should deliver here though idk why Chinese take out places hardly ever do!"}
{"text":"???????????????......????????????????????buffet,?????????????????????????????????????buffet,?......?????????????????????????????????Yelp??"}
{"text":"Sesame chicken was excellent. No hard things in the meat. Nice plump pieces.  Friendly staff and quick service. Best I've had so far in Belmont.  Definitely recommend you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place since they delivered a menu to our front door a few months ago. Finally got the opportunity today when the Pita island was closed (it's Sunday). It's strip mall location didn't deter us, and we headed in with hungry stomachs, excited for a new Chinese restaurant.  First impression, was to turn around and walk right back out. It was at least 95 degrees inside, the booths were clearly bought at auction or surplus as they were literally falling apart at the seams, and the color photos of the food were all slightly blurry, with a nice yellow tint to them. We thought that maybe this was one of those Chinese places that has really good, authentic food, and therefore doesn't need anything fancy for decor, etc.  it's a take-out style, so you order at the counter, nothing spectacular, with that part of the meal, other than their soda machine was out of order (they had canned sodas available), so no ice, which would have been nice considering I was starting to sweat. We ordered chicken egg foo young, hot and sour soup (not for me, I was burning up), and the beef and broccoli combo plate. Total was $20, so price was great. Soup came out first, I am told it was \"ok\", but served nice and hot, so that's a plus. My beef and broccoli with pork fried rice came out in about 10 minutes, and on first glance it looked tasty. Broccoli looked fresh and crisp, nothing over-cooked, but the rice really didn't look like any fried rice I have ever seen. It was yellow, like really yellow. Soy sauce should not make rice yellow, right?!?  Anyway, the sauce on the meat was good, not too heavy, but the meat itself was a horrible quality, my plate was covered in oil (why would there be that much oil for beef and broccoli that isn't fried?!?), and the broccoli left something to be desired.  Lots of brown ends, almost like mold maybe.   And out came the egg foo young. Looked good at first glance, but again, when you looked closer, swimming in grease. There was no sauce, and when we asked for it the waiter muttered something and came back with a little styrofoam cup of the brown goo. And it was cold, like refrigerator cold. Luckily the egg foo young was still flaming hot from the blistery oil. Ok I had intended to finish this off strongly but it's making my stomach hurt. Never agin!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible!!! The sweet and sour shrimp had so much breading you could not find the shrimp.  It tasted like it was fried in smelly old oil.  The Kung Pao chicken should be called  Kung Pao Celery because that's all it was!!!!Celery.  My boyfriend became ill half way through his meal.   I admit  I have been spoiled by the food in the Bay Area,  but this was the worst!!!"}
{"text":"sesame chicken, Mongolian beef and (free) chicken fried rice. I stated I need the Mongolian beef to have very little white onion.   Went to pick up the order and it wasn't ready. Waited and the lady basically throw me my order. She walked away and I had to wait for her to come back to explain I hadn't paid. Also pointed out the Mongolian beef was 95% white oinon. She yelled at me but said she would remake. She remade the dish in 1 minute. This time 5% less white onion and this time it had random things in it that never come with a Mongolian beef and wasnt in the one before.   Explained I would pay for the chicken but to cancel the Mongolian beef. She flipped out and started yelling. I stated that I could have walked out with the whole order free but I am being honest and want to work this out. I ended up only paying for the sesame chicken. As punishment she made sure to remove the chicken fired rice and downgrade my steam rice to a smaller one.    As for the food its self. It had no favoring and the chicken had a weird taste/texture like it had been recooked.   Please avoid at all cost and just go anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is place has the best chinese food in mesa i love this place its awsome the cashiers are always very nice and friendly they always treat me and my family nice. Very nice and oh they also deliver always on time. They say 45 mins its half of that i give this place a 5 star."}
{"text":"The health department should stop by.....soon.  We have gotten take out several times recently. They are always screaming at each other in Chinese. It is a very uncomfortable atmosphere. But last night was and will be our last time. The owner...who is such a rude, obnoxious woman anyway....was breast feeding her baby....at the front counter.  Our food was not ready, so I sat in a booth to wait. It was disgusting to watch food being prepared as she breast fed the kid."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with New China. We got the curry chicken, beef with broccoli, and crab rangoons. All three items were very blah - we were not impressed in the slightest and could have easily made something much better at home. I would highly encourage others to go elsewhere. I will not return to New China."}
{"text":"I live close to the restaurant and have eaten there several times a month ever since they opened maybe 6 years ago or so. Out of all of those experiences, I was only mildly disappointed with the food 2 times. Otherwise the food is good, always hot and fresh. The soups are awesome. I really like the various Low Mein dishes. Very tasty. Orange chicken is good. Chicken fried rice and Pork fried rice is good and a great addition to another menu item. The restaurant is small family owned business and is mainly for take out. They have 6 booths and some tables in the middle. So don't expect a fancy ambiance, that isn't their mission. Linda is the daughter that usually takes the orders and speaks the best English. The Mother is a nice lady and is always there, but speaks only 3 or 4 English words. I like to support small, local owned businesses, especially neighborhood spots. I think you will enjoy their food."}
{"text":"First time was the last time. I just walked in and the woman told me to pay for my food. I just walked in and she starts accusing me of not paying for food when I haven't even ordered yet. No apology or nothing! I should have took that as an omen and left so I didn't have to pay for food that wasn't any good. Sorry, if you aren't going to invest anytime in the taste and preparation of your food, why should I invest any more money?!?"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch with wife. Food was sub-par although portion size was good. Biggest complaint is the place is dirty and I can not believe this place past a health inspection without someone getting paid off by the brown bag full of lettuce. Will never go back. Plus they have there kids bounce house in seating area making it uncomfortable dining experience. I feel there's no help for this place and should be closed down! We will never go back or even order delivery. Just hoping neither myself or the wfife get sick at this point."}
{"text":"This place is DISGUSTING!  So glad I went there before ordering any delivery!  Wasted $6.00 though, took a few bites of the GROSS food & threw it away!!  From the lobby ordering area the back door was opened & NUMEROUS jugs all over the back floor along with the strong smell of CLEANING SOLUTIONS!  I should have walked out then!! I ordered the lemon chicken with rice & egg roll.  The smell was not good in the to go back on the way home.  The lemon chicken is previously FROZEN & the breading was gooey in the middle!  The pour over lemon sauce was NASTY!  The rice was nasty too!  Broke open the egg roll, smelled it, threw it all away!  I should have called & asked for my money back!  The health department needs to check this place out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Will never go back.. The young lady at the counter was rude and unfriendly. She actually yelled at me for making a change in my order.. My co-workers would go here every now and again. We will not good back. DONT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I waffled between two and three stars, here. We've been getting delivery from New China for about a year, primarily due to a lack of other options in our neighborhood. The length of our patronage should show that for a long time we were pretty satisfied, but recently not so much.   In terms of the food--it's not bad. Not the best I've ever had, but there are some shining gems on the menu that kept us going back, like the Japanese Chicken, Amazing Chicken and mein fun. There are also some pretty bad misses, too... the hot and sour soup is really inconsistent. Once in a while, I must get some from a really fresh batch and it's awesome, but most of the time it's just awful. The Mongolian beef is another one on the don't-order-again list--WAY too much onion, not enough beef. Surprisingly, I have found the \"special diet\" category to be the most consistently good there, so if you're watching the calories, you can't go wrong with their simple, steamed dishes.   Also--depending on where you live, of course--delivery is almost always very fast, which is definitely nice!  What finally led to the review and the final decision to go with two stars instead of three was yet another wrong order being delivered. There are couple of issues here:   First, New China offers coupons for free items. The free items are tiered based on how much you spend. This is a really nice gesture and something that attracted me to this restaurant in the first place. However, it is a craps shoot as to  whether you actually receive your free item. I've applied these coupons both over the phone when ordering and using the new online ordering system and either way, the result is that 4 times out of 5, we haven't actually gotten our free item. So... if you use the coupon, don't use it for a meal you really need or someone may be going hungry.   Second is simply other missing items that were actually paid for! One night the white rice is missing, the next night it's sauce or pancakes for the Mushu. Another time it's an order of Lo Mein. Sadly, of late, the complete and correct order being delivered has been more the exception than the rule. I have called in the past to try and have these issues rectified. To their credit, the restaurant has offered to credit my next order, which is at least something--but given that they can't even track the use of coupons correctly, I have absolutely no faith that such a credit would be honored.   Truth be told, there have been Chinese places I've been to where the food was so outstanding that I was willing to overlook issues with service. This is not one of those places. If they're still around in 6 months, a craving for Japanese Chicken may lure me back, but for now, we're on a break."}
{"text":"The food from this place is my favorite fast-food Chinese. I don't mind waiting for it to be prepared when ordered vs sitting around under heat lamps. My only complaint is that because the people who work there speak limited English, it is frustrating when I have a question. They are very friendly...just unable to communicate well."}
{"text":"This place is ok and decent. Few dining tables inside. Reminds me of a spot back in jersey. I don't mind eating at this place. Good customer service and lots of fortune cookies lol. My fam loves it so it's all good for me. Quick Chinese fix on the go  .. As far as prices, not too bad.. I would come back again."}
{"text":"First time customer.  When you walk up to the door and the glass is filthy it should be a clue.  It is self serve.  We were there at lunch time and the lunch specials are only $5.75.  You get an entrée with your choice of steamed or fried rice and a choice of egg roll, wonton or soup.  I ordered Mongolian Beef with Fried Rice and egg roll.  My husband had the Chicken Lo Mein with steamed rice and egg flower soup.  Surprisingly the food was not bad.  My husband really liked his Lo Mein.  My Mongolian beef was mostly yellow onions and bell peppers and really didn't have much flavor.  BUT the bad part.... the food was served on paper plates with plastic forks.  There are toys and supplies stacked in plain view in the eating area.  A small child (very cute and obviously an employees child) playing at the counter.  Counter person had a dirty apron on and the place was generally not clean looking.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"How is this place still open? The good tastes old and just not good. The people are nice but they need to try and cook food, not inedible \"stuff\"?"}
{"text":"For $9.50 you get a large all you can eat container as long as you can close it after getting your food. I guess they charge you more at that point. I was a little irritated with the cashier, she explained the rules about container must close and I completely understood. She was breathing down my neck the entire time as if I was going to not be able to close it and try to run out. I feel like maybe if it has been a problem eliminate the to go platter. The food is good but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here today & got the family dinner for 30.00 it was sooo good. All of the food was so good easily the best chinese I've had. Love it!!"}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in the restaurant I thought it was sit down were they come to wait your table. This is mostly take away I had moo shoo roast pork and won ton soup it was good but they gave me cold flour tortillas instead of the Chinese pancake . If I go there again I would order something else."}
{"text":"Yummy! Love the tea, mixed veggies with chicken in white sauce, lo mein... Service is fast! I come here every week. Great take out Chinese."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food but this place is not great.  It is a bit dirty and I think the food is way over priced for the quality you are getting.  They have a couple of good things on their menu but for the most part I drive a ways to get better food.  They need to clean it up and get the quality under control."}
{"text":"Happy Family & Special Duck!! Awesomely cooked veggies, 2 serving per order!! Love this place-oh and they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered from this place. I had delivery. The place sucks. I ordered a Pu Pu platter and I'm not quite sure what was on it.  I do know that there was no BBQ ribs like it said and there was some strange deep fried crabstickz that are clearly not on the menu. I also had cream cheese wontons that looked and tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. The sweet and sour chicken was disgusting to say the least. I would give - 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"It was OK, I needed a Chinese food fix"}
{"text":"I was in town to watch a high school playoff game and stopped here based on the reviews.  Probably the best General Tso's I've had in the Charlotte area and I think I paid $7.50 for more than enough to fill me up at dinner.  If you are in town and looking for Chinese this is definitely the place in Belmont, NC."}
{"text":"Just so-so.  Lost my online order, because printer wasn't working \"again\", so not a one time problem.  Food was bland, not enough taste and felt like each dish was missing something in the sauce or seasoning.  Granted, I travel to China often, so I have a high bar, but there are a half dozen better Chinese places in the valley.  Fried rice was missing oyster sauce and soy taste, sweet and sour was too mellow, honey chicken needed more salt, pepper and soy."}
{"text":"This place is bomb! The best orange chicken i have ever had. Definitely my favorite chinese place we have found since we have moved here !"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Beware of delivery! You get shorted half your order. The restaurant will not make right of their mistake. Advertised as NY style chinese restaurant however microwaved top ramen will satisfy your hungry better than this cheap garbage food. Beware of positive reviews this place is AWFUL!"}
{"text":"The food here has always been good, no complaints there. The prices are cheap and the service is fast. Friendly employees. The only problem with this place (and it's a big one for me) is the cleanliness of the dining room area and counter. One example is they have sample sizes of their boxes on the counter that are completely covered with dust, thick dust that's been there for a long time. Why would they not take the time to clean a bit? That makes no sense to me. I can't help but wonder if the kitchen is like this as well. Mop the floors, paint the walls and clean the damn place and I'll become a regular."}
{"text":"I live really near this place and compared to the China Buffet down the street it is ten times better. I think Chinese food comes down to what you like and what you order but I think this place is great. It's pretty cheap, they deliver, and they're fast. I liked the lo mein and chicken and broccoli and the General Tso's is the best I've had since I left the East Coast. Not totally perfect, but a whole lot better than most of the other Chinese places I've tried out here."}
{"text":"Food is bland, flavorless. Fried rice was orange, not what fried rice should look like. Cream cheese wontons and lo mein were ok, nothing special. We ordered fried dumplings but were not given any sauce, so we went back to ask for some, got attitude from young woman at the front and she told us that we got some- which we definitely did not. Also got sweet and sour chicken, which was cold, bland and also came with no sauce. Not sweet or sour at all. Definitely not worth a second chance. Would rather buy greasy panda express."}
{"text":"Gross! First off the place was dirty and they had their barefoot child playing video games while the worked. Served on paper plates and super cheap plastic forks. Food was bland and lacked flavor. Staff was friendly enough. Soda fountain needed cleaned.  Silverware was just in a plastic box where everyone getting a fork could have access to it. Booths and chairs and tables run down looking. Gross place! Windows were not even cleaned. There was a ball pit. (I am sure for the small child in the dining area). We won't ever go back. It's amazing what a damp rag and some Mr Clean can do in a place like that."}
{"text":"Good take out Chinese food for a good price. Are there better , of course. Are there worse, most definitely. If you are in the area this is always a good choice. They have excellent lunch specials too."}
{"text":"I eat at New China about once a month. For $6.50 you get an all-you-can-eat buffet, fruit and a drink. I really like the chicken and broccoli. The pot stickers are unique and tasty and the fried rice is pretty good. I don't care for much else on the menu, but it's a good meal for the price."}
{"text":"Good food,  not too much on the personality side!  I highly recommend this place!   Thank goodness it is a takeout!!  In your house, you will enjoy it thoroughly!"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 dishes.  2 of them we couldn't even eat. the other 2 were very mediocre."}
{"text":"I love New China. The service is always fast and fresh! The sweet tea is amazing. Yes, Chinese takeout is everywhere but no one can Beat NEW China in Belmont!"}
{"text":"This is a family owned restaurant. I was the only one in the restaurant when first came in at lunch time. Was debating if I make the right choice. However, after having their sweet tea, it was flavorful so that my confident risen. Then, the 3 chefs started to take their wok and cooked my food right in front of my eyes. WOW, fresh cook fried rice? I was impressed.   After my meal, I felt guilty because it was so cheap. $5 for lunch, includes tax. They even take credit cards!  I would recommend this restaurant. Please support your local merchants.  From the smell, I think they use peanut oil, so ask if you are allergic to peanuts."}
{"text":"I went in for a quick lunch and was very disappointed. I ordered the shrimp and mushroom which came covered in an overly salty brown goop next to some fried rice. The egg roll was definitely not pork and the cream cheese wontons were seriously missing some cream cheese. To top it off, the fountain soda machine had very little CO2 making the drinks syrupy. The lady allowed us to grab free canned soda, so that was nice. Another weird thing was the giant jumping kid area in the middle of the eating area? It said it was not for customers though... very confusing."}
{"text":"It is your standard-issue Chinese joint complete with the same menu, food pictures, employees with the minimum English clarity that you find at all of these places.  For the first time since moving to the Belmont area, i craved some Chinese. i had noticed this little Chinese joint next to the Papa Johns in the Bi-Lo shopping strip and we decided to give it a try.   We were waiting for a car to get done with an oil change so we opted to eat inside this little place. Had we gotten takeout, it may have been 3 stars because the food wasn't too shabby. Pretty standard General Tso chicken, although the broccoli was as cold as the seating area which required us to wear our jackets.   Surprisingly they didn't overcharge for a canned beverage and they did have a self-serve tea station.   While we were eating, we heard one of the cooks make the most obscene throat clearing noise that you usually only hear in the movies. It sounded like he was struggling to bring up a major loogie that was trapped deep within his soul. Fortunately we already had our food.   If you're desperate for Chinese, get it to go."}
{"text":"Did a delivery order from New China tonight for dinner. Ordered the Pu Pu Platter (For 2), and the Orange Flavored Chicken plate. Also ordered the free side of chicken fried rice as well. I made specific specifications about not wanting pork in the rice that comes with the Orange Flavored Chicken plate, and requested chicken instead. Our meal was delivered in a timely fashion, but when we opened our food boxes, it was clear that many mistakes had been made. The Pu Pu platter was missing the bbq spare ribs, in its place were fried sticks of imitation crab. The chicken wings were unrecognizable, and the shrimp were over fried and not cleaned (not deveined). The orange chicken flavored plate wasn't as bad, but not great to ever order it again. Another issue was not receiving our free side of chicken fried rice. As an end result, we will not be ordering from this restaurant again, period."}
{"text":"New China is significantly better food at a marginally more expensive cost.  $6.50 gets you all you can eat with soft drinks.  There food is never cold or older than maybe 20-30 minutes.  I eat there about 3-4 days a week.  The decor is old, the plastic plates and forks are tacky, it's in a bad part of town, but the food is the best chinese buffet food within 15 miles.  you can get $5 buffets other places but they are cold and bad.    New china is a real treat."}
{"text":"I went to this place because the front of their takeout menu said \"N.Y. Style Chinese Restaurant.\"  It was anything but.  I'm from New York, and my favorite Chinese dish is Szechuan Beef.  And in New York, all Chinese restaurants make it the same way: dry shredded beef, with carrots, celery and scallions cut into matchsticks, and bits of chili peppers.  I don't know what they were thinking by calling the stuff they gave me Szechuan Beef.  It was slices of beef (not dry-fried shredded), it was in a tomato-ey sauce, with hunks of peppers, onions, celery, mushrooms, water chestnuts, and everything else they probably had leftover lying around. It wasn't spicy (even though it said spicy on the menu).   Their hot and sour soup wasn't hot or sour. It wasn't the rich brown fragrant soup I remember from NY, it was slightly gelatinous, light amber, and had barely any flavor. It looked and tasted like doctored-up chicken soup.  I also got an order of pork fried-rice.  The pork was ok, but the rice was BRIGHT ORANGE and had no flavor. Since when is fried rice supposed to be orange?  Didn't have the bits of egg either.   It's as if they started with bland leftovers and tried to \"spice\" (I use that term with great sarcasm) it up with food coloring to try to pass it off as flavorful. Well, it fell flat.  I would recommend Panda Express over this sham of a chinese restaurant. I'm angry I wasted $12."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is $6.50, but it is awful.  Horrendous Chinese food. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Consistanly good food, my favorite is scallion chicken xtra spicy....cant beat 4.99 lunch.."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend. The food was ok. If you looking for a Chinese food buffet and your in the area it's 7.00 and you get a drink with all you can eat. I love Chinese food and a tough critic when it comes to it. This is not a place I would go our of my way for."}
{"text":"I am from the east coast and have been searching for Chinese food that is like ours back home. I finally found it!! This place is amazing, food is fantastic, love the fact they have real fried rice with the combos, price is perfect I bought two combos and a large side of veggie lo mein for about 23 bucks. My sweet and sour sauce comes on the side which I love so my chicken doesn't get soggy. Plus to top it all off they delivery!!! Which for me being a new mom is perfect I don't have to load the baby up and drag her to go get food when she should be getting ready for bed. They quoted a 45 min delivery time and showed up before 45 mins. So pleased with the for and customer service!!! I will be eating here again!!! Just wish I would have found this place when I was still pregnant!!! I recommend giving them a try!!"}
{"text":"You definitely need to make this your place of choice! This is the only Chinese food restaurant I come to! I drive out of my way to come here because they are always so friendly, and have great food! Even on a busy holiday where the line is out the door, they make it run so smooth and fast. Watching them work in the kitchen is like watching a well versed orchestra."}
{"text":"So tonight decided to give the restaurant another chance. I must say in12 days things have surely changed the girl taking the order great job with your etiquette on the phone . Delivery fast, and friendly. The food packaged amazing!!! The food was awesome which was never really the issue because it is good. Keep up the Great Changes and my family and I will keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I hate giving negative reviews, but this joint is a shit-show. Never in my entire life have I experienced such an unorganized mess of an establishment.   Arrived at 6:45 on a Friday night. One person ahead of me in line. The cashier was on the phone taking an order. He hangs up, answers the other phone line, takes an order. Hangs up, answers the another phone line, takes an order. Does this six more times, and finally acknowledges the customer in line ahead of me. In the middle of taking her order, they are interrupted by a female cook who is screaming at the cashier in Chinese. The cashier excuses himself from the customer ahead of me. The phone rings, the cashier takes another phone order, goes to the back where he continues to argue with the cook in Chinese. Finally the cashier makes his way back to the register to finish taking the order ahead of me. The phone rings, he answers, takes the order, and then asks me for mine. - a Large Hot & Sour Soup, that's all. - I pay, move to the side and wait for my food. it is now 7:09.   While I stood waiting for my soup, I tried to keep an open mind. Maybe they aren't always this disorganized? Maybe they're were left short staffed today? I decided to be pleasant. It's not their fault it's busy.  The driver came in to pick up some orders for delivery. The female cook screaming and shouting at him in Chinese, he takes seven orders of food to his vehicle, and leaves. By this point the line to order is out the door. People are getting frustrated, the phones is ringing off the hook, and the cooks and cashier are all frazzled, screaming at one another in a language only they can understand.   I began watching the kitchen. I noticed that none of the cooks wore gloves. None of the dishes were even being rinsed between use. There was raw chicken sharing a cutting boards with the fried chicken that was being served. One cook was stirring a bowl od Chow Mein with his hands... No spoons. No gloves. His bare hands. This solidified my choice not to eat the food I had paid for. Mortified by the negligence in the kitchen I stared at the ground praying that Jon Taffer would walk in at any moment to shut this place down. When, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something moving. IT WAS A COCKROACH. I am not kidding. A cockroach crawling across the dining room floor. Is this real life?!   It's 7:32. My order was called, I threw it in the garbage bin, and left.   *Long story short. This is a foul excuse for a restaurant. I can't tell you what the food tastes like. But, I can tell you that it is not handled properly and you may become very sick from eating here. - If you paid attention to the times I wrote, it took 47 minutes for my order of Hot & Sour Soup. 47 minutes to ladle a pre-made soup into a takeout cup. Avoid New China."}
{"text":"Can't really even give this place a one star, unless it would be a minus one.  I sure hope at some point they read these reviews, either that or get shut down.   We have a fairly acceptable meal a few weeks ago, but we ate in and the screaming female in the kitchen was enough to make you want to leave.  That night the Hot and Sour Soup was pretty good.  We also had another Chicken Dish that was good. Then we went back this weekend and what a change!  the hot and sour soup was light blond color and tasteless.  The Shrimp and Veggies was served just warm....the small order did give us 5 large shrimp.  We also had the veggie Egg fu young.  It was so greasy we had a hard time even trying it.  They brought a small cup of the brown gravy for it and it was stone cold, right out of the refrigerator.  we took it back and got it heated, but not sure why, another tasteless brown sauce.  Of the entire meal the white rice was the only really eatable dish we had.   We will NOT be back.  The screaming female and male in the kitchen didn't make for a peaceful meal.  We also noted that the lady on the register was more interested in answering all their phones than taking those orders than the customers in line."}
{"text":"The general tso chicken was really good!  They give you alot of food, everything came out really nice and hot.  The only thing bad I would say about this place is that it's probably not the best place to go for a fancy sit-down dinner.  Definitely a take-out place.  You can see the kitchen from the seating area.  It's clean, but it looks fast food, dive style."}
{"text":"Just like any other take out chinese place.  Super quick, laden with msg and cheap!   We got some take out and it didn't fail.  The tofu and veggies was cooked very well and I had a spring roll which didn't not fail me in my hour of need.  One fail on their part was that they forgot my rice, which I was somewhat looking forward to, but can't complain all that much.    From the time we called in our order and left shortly after our food was made.  For two people, we paid 17 bucks and got 3 courses, so I was pleased enough... rice or no rice!"}
{"text":"We got a flyer for this restaurant a few weeks ago, and it said it delivered, so we decided to try it out last night. This restaurant was okay, at best. The delivery itself didn't take too long, which was refreshing. It was a bit difficult to order, as there was a bit of a language barrier.  The food was, again, okay. The hot & sour soup was the biggest disappointment. It was super bland- which was so sad because it's usually my favorite food! The orange chicken was actually surprisingly flavorful, and very orange-y. The vegetable lo mein was also pretty good. The rice that came with the meal was too mushy, but it wasn't a big deal.  Overall, it wasn't fantastic, but the convenience of delivery will keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Love the sweet and sour chicken, chicken and snow peas, along with their egg rolls. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I've had yet... I place a delivery order for my first time because they left a coupon for a free fried rice. The lady over the phone must of just got dumped of something because she had a attitude. Not only that she told me 35 when it took a hour. Orange chicken is gross I tossed it the beef and broccoli is like bubble gum. Thank you for the side of white rice because that was the only thing that tasted good. Orange chicken tasted like it has Vicks in it the crab puffs are not crab puffs. But don't take my word order for yourself! I hope the delivery driver only drives because his nails looked like wolverine. I'd go to panda before I order from this place again.   Good substitute is Grace garden! Bombbb Chinese food."}
{"text":"I walked in for the first time and had to get the cashiers attention because she was texting on her phone.   My order: veggie low mein, cream cheese wontons, white rice. (Vegetarian)  Received: veggie low mein, crab puffs, and pork fried rice.   I asked the cook for what I originally asked for, and he said he did what the ticket said, then proceeded to show me it. I said, if I could eat this I would but I'm a vegetarian. He brought me over a bowl of steamed rice and after separating the pork out of my vegetable low mein, it tasted good.  We left within 5 minutes if receiving my food because the cashier was screaming in Chinese on the phone at someone. Bad idea to go there."}
{"text":"First time here. One of the owners is on the phone just talking loud in the eating area. The other older lady is loud on the phone in the cooking area. Our person that is supposed to be taking our order is to busy texting and not even making eye contact. I'm sorry am I'm disturbing you while you supposed to be taking our order!!!! There's another customer in here he's been standing at the counter to order for 15min now and no one has even bothered to acknowledge him!! So far the customer service SUCKS!!! Hopefully the food is good to make up for lack of service!!! Even if it is good I won't come back just due to poor service!!! Just tasted the food....the food is amazing!!! Just wish the service was the same"}
{"text":"If you like Uncle Ben's-style rice served on paper plates in a pigsty, this is the place for you. Seriously-bugs crawling all over the booth, filthy filthy and not the least bit friendly. I will NEVER come back."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill it used to be good; the price for the food you got was decent but now it's way overpriced and you get crappy food with attitude from the woman at the register who just sits there playing games or watching videos on her phone while you stand there waiting to be acknowledged. Believe me when I say skip this place your better off somewhere else."}
{"text":"I first tried this when one of my coworkers recommended it. I didn't try the buffet but ordered the pork chopsuey. It was the best I've had in a long time. Today after a class I had it again and my boyfriend joined me on his lunch break. He had the buffet and said that it was good. He's hard to please when it comes to food so when he says something is good I believe him lol. I ordered the pork chopsuey again and it was just as good. We are definitely eating here again when we have more time."}
{"text":"I have a tender place in my heart for this poor little place... but with that said, it has sadly gone down hill. This is the most hit-and-miss restaurant that I can think of, sometimes the food will be good and others the spicy entrees will be far too candy-like sweet, or the dry food will be greasy, or the savory and powerful dish will be bland and uninteresting. There's no knowing how they'll do. In fact they are so erratic that even going here anymore has become to risky a gamble of my money. If you want good Chinese food that does the proud Chinese culinary heritage right, this is not the place you're looking for. (My advice would be go down to the Mekong Market Asian shopping complex down on Dobson and Main here in Mesa if you want great Asian food. They have Chinese, Thai, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Filipino, Cantonese Chinese, and bakeries. Best Asian food in the city)"}
{"text":"Dirty, they haven't swept the floors in what seems like a week there's so much stuff on it. Egg drop soup is flavorless, everything is served on disposable plates, bowls... I'm totally cool with divey places as long as the food is good. This is just a straight up dive. Don't waste your money here. King pao chicken is salty and lacks any other flavor. Very bland, not a fan. Customer service is also lacking. Go ahead and go across the road to Thai corner. That place is bomb."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this is one of the first times I've ever had to wait for my food to cool down after being delivered. It was hot and fresh, there was nothing missing and everything was correct. The generals chicken was great as well as the chicken friend rice. I usually never get won ton soup any more at Chinese restaurants (although I love it) because there are never any noodles but I decided to try and this place filled it up! Delivered in 20 min! Great!"}
{"text":"I actually thought the flavor and prices were good, but I went to the restroom and found a cockroach! Yuck, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The pork egg rolls are usually very good. My son loves the orange flavored chicken, though sometimes it can be overly sweet. I always like the Four Seasons or Shrimp & Beef in Kung Pao sauce.  The sauces are not overwhelming & the veggies are always crisp and fresh. The pot stickers, however, are a disappointment. Overall, a good, quick, inexpensive place for Chinese takeout."}
{"text":"The customer service  for this place is crap they are rude and uniformitive when trying to place a order. Once the driver arrived for the delivery he ripped me off two bucks and started walking away it seemed he did  to not speak english. As a result he just kept walking and drove off in his car. Based on how rude and aweful the employees were I actually was worried they might have done something to the food which was just hard to eat and was rather plain as well"}
{"text":"Lots of tasty take out! But the lady taking the orders is so damn rude ! Rush rush rush !"}
{"text":"I ordered the Spicy Beef Lunch Combo. The beef was an odd pink color and the flavor was poor to mediocre. The meat itself was tough and chewy. The fried rice was yellow.... really yellow, and it looked like it had been sitting for weeks. I ate a few bites and decided it was not worth getting sick. I threw my food away and left. I have been to a number of really shady looking Chinese places, but I have never been nervous to eat the food. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I still wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A new low for any mom and pop stores. Exemplary for when one shouldn't open up a restaurant. The kitchen was filthy as were all the kitchen equipment.There was so many things wrong with this place that I will only put a synopsis  Food was horrible. Management and service was terrible. No health inspection score posted and the kitchen and establishment reflects it. My new comparisons for all restaurants will be \"is it worse than New China?\"  I would recommend this place to all my enemies or to people looking for cheap explosive enemas."}
{"text":"This is my first time here, I've lived in the neighborhood for about a year. I always go by this place when I go to Bashas, but I've never been in. I tried the Happy Family and the fried crab sticks I found both to be very good."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food! Will definitely be back. I ordered the house Lo mein which was absolutely delicious! Actually some of the best I've had in awhile also the orange chicken was awesome! My husband is picky about rice and we were not disappointed their either:)   ALSO I'd like to say to the comments about the staff. I'd just like to say that they were beyond nice and friendly. Showed cleanliness and good manners.    And they were kind enough to allow me to run to Walmart across the street and delay my order so I could get my errands done and had my meal hot and ready exactly the time they promised."}
{"text":"This place is the best value restaurant in all of Phoenix.  $7 buffet.  Can't be beat! The food is pretty standard Chinese.  And they keep bringing out hot fresh food over the lunch hour.  Includes a drink! Wow!   Also some decent non-Chinese food options like fries, chicken wings, and fried fish on the buffet."}
{"text":"I wish I had found the previous review instead of the reviews I found on Urbanspoon.com.  I agree with the previous reviewer--save your money and eat at Panda Express instead!  Our family ordered three of the lunch menu specials:  Kung Pao Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Lemon Chicken.  Out of the three, the Orange chicken was the best, but still not nearly as good as Panda's.  The Kung Pao Chicken had no flavor and was not spicy like Kung Pao should be.  The Lemon Chicken was the worst of all--thin chicken fillets fried in a thick, undercooked, greasy batter with a thin flavorless sauce on the side.  The fried rice was orange as described by the other reviewer and had no eggs and the pork in ours was on the dry side.  Although we have had better, we did enjoy the egg rolls."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved here from New York in 2006 good New York style Chinese food is very hard to find here in Mesa this place not only has the best quality food but their menu is laid out just like a true hole in the wall New York City Chinese restaurant and we love it I highly recommend this place the price is rightThe food is great and you can have as many Fortune cookies as your heart desires I don't like the house after dark but my wife and I were singing for this Chinese food so bad we hopped in the car and had a delicious dinner I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Not much to choose from but you only pay 7$ including drink. Noodles are the best dish. Eveything else is ok. Its good for a work time lunch"}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I have guests over to my side of the valley I always suggest they eat here and everyone is always pleased! Every dish we have had has been amazing"}
{"text":"Not only do they have good, quick Chinese food but the customer service is great. I order different meals each time and they've always been good. One of the last times I ordered, they gave me a vegetarian meal instead of the chicken meal I ordered. I called in as a heads up and the lady told me the chef was new and and saved my phone number and correct order. The next time I ordered it, it was free. It's rare to find good customer service anymore; Finding it here when I've never had good customer service experiences at other Chinese restaurants was refreshing. They're a go-to for my boyfriend and I. They also don't charge and get crazy over asking for extra sauces. Their food is good and the prices are really good. You don't pay a ton, but they give you a lot of food - you can easily save lunch for tomorrow when you order dinner portions."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here a few times a month or so for the last few years. I've never had to bring anything back or throw anything out because it didn't taste good. I recommend the Singapore mein fun. The chicken soup and wonton soup are our go to soups when we are sick.  It's not New York Chinese food quality but it's good and not greasy. The sitting area and kitchen could use a good deep cleaning I think.  Also, check and make sure you have everything when you order pick up :)  Overall I recommend this place."}
