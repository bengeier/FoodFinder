{"text":"atmosphere is amazing but the beers are expensive! I ordered a bucket of beer bc it's cheaper that way but boy was i wrong! $6 per bottle! I could not believe it. If i would have known i would have pre-gamed at my place. The waiters are nice but I didnt like the way they were dressed, they seemed as though they had just finished cleaning their house-sucky ponytail, shorts and a t-shirt. However, There was a live mariachi for two hours which was ok but they didnt  know two songs i requested which really disappointed me. If i ever go again, it will only be for the free mariachi."}
{"text":"Update (5/26/10):  Mariachi Valle del Sol no longer performs here.  I don't know if Placido will hire a different group or not but whoever replaces them will be of lesser quality.  Maybe he'll rename the place \"La Casa Banda\" instead.  Until Valle del Sol gets another \"planta\", my Friday nights will now be at Cervantes' in Mesa.  

The very best thing about this place is the free, two hour mariachi show starting at 8pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights.  Mariachi Valle del Sol performs, in my opinion the best group in Phoenix.  Headed by Armando Chacón, the group has seven musicians and will play your requests.  But please, gabacho, don't ask for Cielito Lindo again unless you are visiting from Asia or Europe.  

The main ballroom features banda/ norteña music for the young crowd and has an admission charge so continue to the back for the free show in the smaller cafe.

Hey, Lisa, \"michelada\", Mexican style, often has Clamato in it."}
{"text":"Am I in Mexico?  Am I in Phoenix? I'm so confused!  That's what La Casa Del Mariachi will do to you.  The moment you step through the doors, you'll feel like you're in Mexico and on a mini-vacation!  The only prob you might encounter is that a lot of the menu is in Spanish, so if you don't speak any, you might need to ask someone who does for a little help.

The decor is bright and vivid, with colorful paintings and lights everywhere.  I also like the vibe of the place, it's very lively and there is almost always a mariachi band playing along with dancers.  

The food is great, but there is sometimes a communication barrier with servers.  Try the shrimp skillet- it's my favorite!"}
{"text":"'Doh!  I thought I was gonna be the first to review, for sure.  Guess not.  Went here before catching a flight and needed our food fast, no problem!  We each ordered a beer.  The strange thing is that she ordered her michoada style and it had tomato juice in it.  She reassured me this is normal for a certain kind of michoada but I think tomato juice wasn't made to be combined with beer.  Vodka?  Absolutely!! Beer? Nope.
I got the tostada and the gf got the fajitas.  Both carne asada, gracias.  Anyway, my tostada was tasty.  I forgot to ask how her fajitas were.  We were in and out in 20 minutes.  
One curious thing is that they have a poster on a wall in the bar explaining how many cocktails you can order at a time.  For example, as one person, I could only ordered two.  But with my gf, we could have ordered 5.  Good to know!"}
