{"text":"As first timers here we ordered a couple easy standby's, you know the stuff no one should be able to mess up but which can be a good gauge to see if the restaurant is any good. We ordered good ol' General Tso's Chicken and Yang Chow fried rice, also with 2 spring rolls and a hot and sour soup. The chicken tasted like pork crackin's, I think it was pre-cooked, then battered and then fried at very high temp to get it crispy. The sauce was pretty good though, tangy, a little spicy, sweet. The fried rice was fine, nothing special. The spring rolls were greasy and the wrappers were broken on the corners, presumably from being frozen and banged about a bit. The hot and sour soup was just ok as well. I wouldn't order any of these things again. I think this place is probably okay for chinese food if you don't care about food being good quality."}
{"text":"I can't believe I am initiating a review of this place, that nobody has done so yet is quite surprising!! This is the original location with a satellite branch opened a few years ago in LaSalle, which is much larger for family gatherings or parties.  My introduction to Ping was about 7 years ago while on temporary assignment in the area. My co-worker, a single guy whom almost never prepared meals for himself, rather be armed with a plethora of local restaurant menus just asked what style interested my palette. His suggestion of Ping was more than justified as we ordered several dishes each for sampling. Since then I have some die-hard favorites while a few not so much, but for the most part the portions are huge, even in the 'small' size which can be enough for 2 people.  My favorites are:  #9  Singapour noodles, so far the benchmark of which all other restaurants are judged, if you find a better place, please let me know!  #28 Breaded seafood with pepper, best consumed in-house as the crispy texture of the batter is at it's prime. If you do order for delivery or take-out, as the steam from the seafood softens the batter's texture, best to put the ingredients on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper then into a 350f oven for about 8 minutes to regain the crispiness...this dish with the hot peppers is perfectly paired with a well chilled glass of Tsing Tao beer!!  #37 Soo Guy chicken, moist breast in a nice crispy batter with dipping sauce.  #51 Thai style garlic chicken, a perfect chunky-style soup for a cold winter day.  #52 Chicken with spicy peanut sauce, title says it all, tender morcels of chicken in a sauce that will surprise first time tasters.  With so much more to taste it will take a while to try them. So good is the food mentioned above, even though I live in St. Laurent and work in Rosemont I will still make the trek to buy on my way to work, hence is how I suggested the re-crisping method for the breaded seafood!!  After suggesting this restaurant to others, they are hooked, so I am looking forward to more opinions."}
{"text":"Saddens me to have to change my review but I've ordered from here a few times and I always got the chicken with crispy spinach which was good. After many other times ordering it was just so crap that I now refuse to eat there. Everything is so breaded there's no meat. Orange beef was just really really bad tossed the rest out. Wonton soup taste like lake water. Spring rolls not fresh at all. Dumplings for a piece of nerve inside or bone very disturbing. My friend and I made a vow to never order from there again and he's not even a picky eater. We gave them lots of chances and now it's the last one."}
{"text":"Very Good Chinese take out. I'll order again for sure! Not the best place for dining out but great for take out. Family owned. You'll wait a little bit longer than usual but shows food is prepared to order. Very happy!"}
