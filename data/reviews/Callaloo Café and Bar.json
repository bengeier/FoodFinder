{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the first time last weekend and really liked the upbeat vibe from both the patrons and band, however my excitement was quickly diminished once my order arrived. I ordered a dish with curried chicken, potato and vegetables. I received a plate with a couple pieces of curried chicken (mostly bones) and what appeared to look like a fried flour tortilla and no vegetables. I asked the server about the missing items and she later informed me the chef stated he ran out of the veggies and gave me a $3.00 discount. I wasn't satisfied with the discount because I also did not have a potato and the chef should've advised the server to tell me he was out of the side dishes and request I choose another entr√©e. Needless to say this made for a most disappointing experience. I will probably give it another shot later this year for cocktails and dancing."}
{"text":"I was invited here by a friend a while ago. The staff was very friendly and the food was very tasty and authentic. It's definitely one of the best places in Cleveland to get real, authentic Caribbean food."}
{"text":"I really like the fish dishes like fish tacos and burritos. I normally don't care for macaroni and cheese that much but theirs is terrific. The bar selection seems solid, though I end up with (non-alcoholic) ginger beer. I've had two people tell me they found the chicken dishes bland, and I would not recommend salad here. But those fish dishes and the friendly service - and the nice atmosphere - keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I usually make a five star hard to get.  But this place deserved it.  Good food, good service, good atmosphere.

I came here with two associates on a Tuesday night.  One of them was actually from Trinidad, and I wanted to treat her to a good meal that reminded her of home.  I was kind of concerned because the facebook site had a prompt for reservations.  I was thinking, \"am I bringing my friends to a \"fru fru\" yuppie joint.   No need to worry, this is a laid back Latin American place, informal, clean, friendly and featuring good food.

Not sure what to make of Callaloo, it's a bar with good food....it's a restaurant with a great bar...what the hell, you get the best of both worlds.  Menu was pretty minimal but don't let that fool you, there is some good stuff in there.  I can't remember the names of the Trinidad based dishes, but it involved jerk chicken, beans and, macaroni pie (Mac and Cheese) and a creamed spinach based dish.  My dates ordered the immense meals involving jerk chicken, I pussied out and ordered two soft shell tacos with chicken.  

Like your typical Hispanic mothers, the ladies insisted I eat a portion of their meals, it was good.  Kind of on the sweet side with pineapple and cinnamon.  Chicken was fall off the bone tender.  Portions were huge and each plateful was 12 bucks.  The Tacos were good, they had a Trinidadian spin to it, sweet and spicey but well worth the $8.50 price tag.  The ladies also insisted I try Carib beer which was smooth and cold.

Service was great, Chef came out to talk to us and make his recommendations.  The waitress was a real sweetheart.  Too bad I was too old and married.  This was one lady I would have loved to meet again.  The waitress/bartender was very patient as my associates were kind of difficult about dividing the bill...but I digress.

Loved this place, atmosphere was laid back and comfortable.  There is street parking available.  I could spend a whole evening here listening to music and sipping Carib beer."}
{"text":"Great service (thanks Trini)... Better food and drinks!! So glad we found this place on our 2 day trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen one of those cartoons where a character smells an amazing smell in the air and then literal floats along the cloud-like trail of scent, eventually finding the source of it?  Well, that is what happened to my friends and I last night, as we walked up Waterloo looking for something cool to eat. Our noses led us to the amazing jerk meats sizzling away on the large black barrel grill. And when you see that kind of grill, you know it's about to get serious!

This place featured island style food from Trinidad. The decor was artsy,  with a beautiful tropic wall mural and table top collages. The super friendly, irie owner and employees really made you feel alright. We all ordered a Rum Romance drink, made with high proof rum to get you in the mood. I highly recommend going there just for this drink if anything! It felt like I was back in Key West drinking at a tiki bar. Many more of these drinks followed. The soundtrack was Soca, Dancehall, reggae until the DJ showed up and played more modern dance music. 

The jerk fish tacos were amazing. Well balanced heat and refreshing toppings. The jerk chicken burrito was tasty and the loaded nachos were yummy. I can't wait to go back! I could become a regular there, no problem! Well done, guys!"}
{"text":"The food is from Trinidad, it is delicious. Stewed chicken, curry chicken, calalloo, is phenomenal. Ambiance is open, warm, with live music. The chef comes out to greet you, easy parking. Had a wonderful time and a delicious meal with my family. Thank you."}
{"text":"This is going to start out reading as a 1-star review, but bear with me.  I went here with a rather large group.  We made reservations for 17 people and they took us on.  Only two people work here, it seems.  The bartender and the cook/owner.  The bartender didn't seem familiar with the menu or the drink options.  She covered our group and the whole bar.  The cook came out to explain what was available and what wasn't.  The menu itself wasn't current so he had to make a few verbal alterations.  Since he's the only cook, it took us forever to all get food and some people didn't get their food until after everyone else was done.  It was a long and very slow night.  Kind of painful in some ways.  But, one cook making a bunch of options for 17 people and the bar is a crazy task so I'm not going to fault the guy.  At the end of the day, I just wish the bartender knew more and that the menu was up to date.

So why the 4 stars?  The cook was a champ and he took care of us as good as any single person could.  I don't expect anything better from what's essentially a one-man-army.  The only reason I'm taking a star away is because the bartender didn't know much.  I feel like this is her first time working in a restaurant/bar, to be honest.  Had the cook instead suggested we get a family style meal that he could cook in large batches, our experience wouldn't have been so slow.  That was a learning experience for the restaurant and our group (we hit up a new restaurant every month).  If we were a table of 4, the food service would have been spot on.  

Note to celiacs, it's going to be hard to get uncontaminated food.  The cook did a great job telling me what to avoid and he did his best to keep things right for me, but I still had a minor flair-up afterwards.  

I expect this place to improve as they grow.  I also wanted to share my story so that larger groups know to ask for a family style meal.  The cook is super casual and he very much reflects the Caribbean relaxed style.  I'm sure he would take care of a group in this such manner.

Lastly, don't mistake the relaxed Caribbean style as being slow or that there's some attitude that the customer is not important.  The cook is very customer-focused.  The island folk are casual and chill and that can sometimes seem off to people used to the busy American city life."}
{"text":"My first time trying Trinidadian cuisine. Came here on a night where they had a live band playing, Chakai Manta... plus!! Not a very big place. It's a long, narrow space with tables and seating on one side, and the bar and kitchen on the other.

As the band started playing, people started to fill the place up. It took a while for a server to come our way as she was by herself. Eventually, as the place filled up, the bartender had to step in and take some tables as well. Wait staff was spread thin, but were very friendly. The place was lively. Live Latin American music with many of the patrons dancing in the small space right by the entrance.

Onto the food... as I am unfamiliar with Trinidadian cuisine, we asked the server some questions about the menu. I heard their wraps/burritos are very good, but I was starving and wanted something a little fuller. Our server suggested something I didn't see on the menu... Jerk Chicken. She mentioned that it comes with rice and beans, salad and corn on the cob. Sold! Also had their soup of the day, which was a spicy broth with corn... pretty good. My platter, however, left something more to be desired. While the jerk chicken was okay - nicely seasoned and spiced, the rice and beans were hard and dry - as hungry as I was, I didn't finish it, and it's very rare that I don't clean my plate. There was a tiny bit of salad on the plate, which had no dressing on it whatsoever. Also, I thought the whole portion was scant (see photo for proof). I opted for the \"dinner\", which was the most expensive thing on their menu for $12 thinking that I'd be getting a pretty good portion.

Needless to say, I had room for dessert. Asked the server what the dessert options are and she responded with \"let me ask\". Huh? She came back and said \"you want one or two blueberry pies?\" I thought it was funny that she just assumed that we wanted it, but we played along and said we'd share one. The pie came in a bowl in a hefty scoop. It looked more like cobbler... and to my surprise, it was actually very, very good! I've read good reviews on the drinks here, but I don't really drink. Tried one dish here so far, and it was okay. On this visit, I think the dessert... along with the band Chakai Manta, is what I'll remember. I'll come back and try their roti and burrito next time."}
{"text":"The owner \"Callaloo\" is a vibrant, upbeat friendly personality just like the restaurant! The atmosphere takes you to the islands and food puts your there! The Callaloo is a great place for live Poetry, bands and art. The bartenders are great! Very nice, personable and they will remember your order everytime! Great secret of the Cleveland Underground performance food scene in be Waterloo Arts District. Calloloo Cafe is a lovely gem of the Waterloo Arts District!"}
{"text":"Ate here before a Beachland show, great quesadilla and burrito, authentic homemade taste."}
{"text":"Was the best chicken I've ever had. Their jerk chicken out on the smoker was grilled to perfection. Crispy and smokey on the outside and moist and fresh in the inside. Their jerk sauce was really good too. Only $6 and we got like 5 pieces."}
{"text":"First time going there loved it! Every bite packed a punch of flavor! Jerk chicken, ribs, Mac n cheese, and his specialty island drink were all delicious and reasonably priced!! Loved the owner, super friendly with good service! My mom even got a free drink for Mother's Day! Will definitely be back for food soon!"}
{"text":"1st his place is off the hook good. The vibe is amazing, I'm reluctant to write such a positive review as I hope this place does not become infected with lumber sexuals. Yeah I know I said it.

For starters they have live music on the weekends. The service is amazing and dranks are pretty reasonable. Don't come here asking for a fancy drinks, not really that kind of place. 

The owner is really seems like a cool person and likes the people who visit. You get a nice mix of peeps at this joint, Culturally diverse. Oh I should point out that he was grilling jerk chicken durring a friggin Ohio hurricane while transformers were blowing out

Okn let's  talk about the fact that the bird is the the freaking word here. This may in fact be some of the best bird I have had in the 216.  I have never met a jerk chicken that did not like. Yeah this jerk was off the hook.  Yes this was bone in jerk ass chicken that is slow grilled in a barrel grill. This imparts a rich smokey flavor. This chicken was such a jerk that it slapped me in my pie hole and I like it.

The curry chicken was really fantastic as well. The dinner plates come with rice and beans, the bird of choice, callaloo, and some very unique Mac and cheese. I mountain of food, really really good food. To steal a quote from DID flavor town
 If want  excellent island food, great vibes, cool peeps and  live music your not going to do much better than this  joint. Lumber sexuals please stay in your craft beer holes."}
{"text":"I walked down here from the Beachland Ballroom between sets and found this awesome little slice of Trinidad to enjoy some live music and food.  Super friendly staff, with a nice bar and a kitchen in the back.  Lots of locals getting carry out is always a good sign. 

I had the curry chicken dinner and it was an awesome and huge plate of food!  It included lots of rice, beans, plenty of slow cooked flavorful chicken, salad, and the most amazing side dish of okra/spinach.  I usually hate okra, but this was awesome. The way they make it stewed with wilted spinach(?) had me wanting some more to take home.

There was also an open mic going on with some local talent entertaining us between the DJ mixing some cool vibes.  Such a cool room."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar.  I love the genuine Caribbean vibe this place has, thanks to the owner who is actually from Trinidad and exudes Caribbean culture and hospitality.  It's a great place to just hang out, listen to some live reggae, jazz, or R&B bands, and drink some excellent Trinidadian rum.  Pop over to the connected art gallery to check out what's on display.  If you come here, and you are a relaxed, down to earth, fun loving person, you are guaranteed to love it.  There's live music most Saturdays, and open mic night most Wednesdays.  If you go, be sure to talk to the owner, he's one of the nicest, warmest guys you'll ever meet."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it, but I just didn't. Granted, we only got the nachos. But the quality of that scared us off from ordering anymore. It looked like the meat was steakums, the chips where cheap circular bulk buy chips with no flavor. There was pineapple and beans, but it didn't stick to the chips at all and fell loosely onto the plate below and were regrettably very dry. It was very over priced for what we got. There are some unique beers on the list, but I honestly don't feel very compelled to return. 

From what I understand the bar before this used to open up into the neighboring art gallery, which probably helped their business, the door is closed now however, and it just kind of makes me wonder if something was lost."}
{"text":"I went here several times the first two I didn't order any food. I guess the third time was the charm. I ended up ordering and had been craving the food ever since. Well today I ordered some food and it's horrible. The food is burnt you can taste the scorch taste. All throughout everyone thing and even the roti bread is over cooked. I'm so disappointed cause I been having a craving for this. Right now I don't know if I'll order from here again!"}
{"text":"We were here on a slow night and it still took a long time to get food. We didn't really mind because what came out was fresh and very delicious (though I wish they wouldn't use a microwave for reheating anything, ever). Just know that the kitchen is tiny and runs on island time going in and you'll be bound to enjoy yourself more. Service is attentive and friendly even though the kitchen is a bit slow. As for the food, it reminded me a lot of the seaside lolos in the Caribbean, and that's a very good thing. Rich, homey flavors that I'm eager to try again, especially when the cold winds of winter start depressing me."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. I came here with a friend for a quick bite before a show at Beachland Ballroom, which is just a few storefronts away.  It's a small place but uncrowded on a cold Friday night. The owner/chef/bartender was also our server (not sure how he manages when busier.). He was very friendly and promptly came over when I caught his eye but let us chat without distubing.  I tried the Bad Apple, which was a tasty vodka-based cocktail special (with happy hour pricing only $4!).  The menu is brief and centered around the curried chicken or tofu, but also with some fish options.  I had the curried chicken roti. The roti was incredible--kind of like the Indian roti, but also like a thin, tender, layered, and fluffy wheat tortilla. It was perfect for scooping up chunks of the chicken, which was flavorful and moist with the bone-in random chunks common to island cuisine. The accompanying chickpeas were also good. We were offered \"spice\" (hot sauce), which was provided on the side, fortunately! It's a beautiful yellow amber color, and it is really hot!  

This place is also a good option for vegetarians with tofu options.  My friend didn't want the macaroni pie due to its having cheese in it, and his request was accommodated readily.  Definitely a good little spot for a drink or a quick meal prior to a show at Beachland. They also have live music Sat nights.  I'll be looking forward to returning here!"}
{"text":"I have been to Callaloo for multiple events and random nights and the food and people have always been great. The owner has created a great space for all people to enjoy a taste of the culture and have their voice heard. From open mics to gallery receptions, private parties to just aDamn good time. This is a gem in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great food and great service from the wonderful Trinidadian folks who cook and serve. Try the roti curry and don't be afraid to get it with curried tofu. And the chicken callaloo soup for which the place is named, of course!"}
