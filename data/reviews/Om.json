{"text":"Whenever I feel like I'm coming down with something, I go get their Then Tuk, which is the Tibetan version of a chicken noodle soup.  But oh, the noodle is fresh and handmade, with a satisfying texture and consistency; the soup is a nice rich broth with spinach to make you feel even more virtuous.  I ask for some extra spice to, which gives it a good kick and clears away anything ick that may be in the sinuses!  Also, really like the friendly folks who run the place.  It's low-key, very reasonable prices and pretty good food all around."}
{"text":"The food is cheap and very tasty. The owners are friendly and the service is great. I truly recommend it! We had momos, a veggie curry, the steamed&the fried breads (the fried bread is more on the sweet side and it's delicious) dahl soups & samosas. The portions are big enough so we can bring a lot home and enjoy it again the next day. :)"}
{"text":"So so good, they serve traditional Tibetan dishes, as well as delicious Indian food. The dumplings are superb and almost any dish is guaranteed to please.  The servers are super nice and helpful, and the decor is quite relaxing. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"As a big fan of Tibetan food, I was expecting a fine gastronomic experience coming to this restaurant, but I left unimpressed. The folks who own the place are extremely courteous, but the vegetarian tofu dishes we ordered were dull as dishwater. We were looking forward to having their momos, but they turned out to be overly starchy. Made with more dough than actual filling. It's too bad, I really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Getting to try Tibean food at Om was a treat so we ordered from the Tibetan part of the menu and skipped the Indian food.  The menu offers several kinds of dumplings (taste better than the word sounds) and realizing it was our first time, our server offered to bring a mixed platter of several kinds which was terrific.  The stir-fried beef with mushrooms was awesome.  Lentil soup was tasty but a bit thin to me.  Slow paces, but that was fine for us."}
{"text":"I went there in a Saturday night and the place was half full, but still chill with calm music. The waiter was willing to answer our questions about the food and all, one of them I believe is the owner, he was very friendly and even told us a little about his history... We ordered the Table d'Hôte for 2, with two starters, 2 main dishes, 2 desserts and coffee/tee at the end. We started with soups, both tasty, especially mine made with blue cheese (only thing, I think there could be some bread). The main dishes were Momos, a typical gyoza-style Tibetan dish, it was delicious! The desserts were good too, mine was a little small, just a little Indian candy ball covered with syrup, stay with the chocolate cake if you want to stuff yourself with dessert! ;) We had a great experience there, I totally recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service! The owner was very nice, and even recommended other restaurants to me to visit during my stay in Montreal. Definitely recommend the Momo dumplings!"}
{"text":"My family and I had such a great experience at Om for our first Tibetan meal. While we've eaten plenty of Indian food, we were at a loss for what Tibetan food to order. Thankfully, Tashi our waitress was more than happy to assist us with order. Staff was very amicable and food was outstanding. Put Om on your list if you are looking for great Tibetan food. We will be back next time we are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"This restaurant markets itself as Tibetan-Indian, and it's an interesting concept, but in reality I found the food fairly bland and uninspiring.  We got the Butter tofu, a plate of momos and a dal soup and none of the dishes really stood out. The ingredients did not taste fresh and overall it did not feel worth the money. Perhaps we caught them on a bad night, or the dishes we ordered weren't their specialties, but I, for one, was not, impressed. There is better Tibetan and better Indian food to be had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Ne t'arrête pas à la vitrine un peu trop sale de ce restaurant... à l'intérieur c'est propre et chaleureux.. Les serveurs sont aux petits soins et souriants, la cuisine est une vraie découverte, sans se ruiner... Un restaurant sans prétention, pas de la fine cuisine, mais cela se laisse manger !   La majorité des plats est cuisinée le soir-même. Donc n'hésite pas à faire part de tes allergies ou à demander de ne pas trop épicer !  Nous avons essayé d'appeler comme nous étions un samedi soir.. sans réponse.. Chance pour nous, ce n'est pas loin de notre appart donc nous nous sommes tout de même rendus sur place et avons eu la dernière table dispo pour 6 personnes, ouf ! :-)  À refaire, pourquoi pas !"}
{"text":"Je sais qu'il faudra que j'y retourne plus d'une fois pour bien valider cette note parfaite, parce qu'après une seule visite je suis déjà bien convaincue que c'est un des meilleurs restos indien de la ville!   Tout d'abord en commençant par la clé d'une bonne expérience en restaurant, le service. Le charmant monsieur qui nous a servi avait une telle passion pour ce qu'il fait que nous nous sommes sentis accueillis comme si nous étions chez lui. Offrant une description du menu claire, se dévouant a la tâche de nous servir un excellent repas trois services, c'est une des choses qui m'a le plus charmée de cet endroit, le service 5 étoiles.  Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, c'était bien assaisonné, juste assez épicé et les portions étaient très généreuses. Je vous conseille fortement la table d'hôte à deux si vous y allez accompagné(e)s, le rapport qualité/prix est incroyable. On connaît bien le pain naan, mais le OM propose aussi un pain cuit vapeur, une spécialité tibétaine. À essayer!  Et pour finir, le dessert. Des choix savoureux, classiques de la cuisine indienne qui plairont à tous! Ce qui m'a le plus surpris à la fin du repas, c'est que le café qu'on nous apporte est un excellent espresso allongé qui fait différent des cafés filtre à la limite de leur fraîcheur qu'on nous sert bien souvent ailleurs!  Bref, j'y suis ressortie le sourire aux lèvres et j'avais déjà hâte de me trouver une excuse pour y retourner bientôt"}
{"text":"Average setting. Nice vibe with music & deco. Food was ok, nothing i would run back to eat but might want to visit another time to try other dishes ! Service was great."}
{"text":"J'allais souvent à un restaurant tibétain à Toronto. J'ai voulu renouer avec mes habitudes ici. Uen belle surprise. Prix plus qu'abordables, excellent service. La salade et vinaigrette, le pain sucré, les mo-mo,  la sauce verte à la menthe.  J'y retourne!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the good: their house white wine is surprisingly good, by any means not an amazing wine but the type of wine I would reorder again because it's fresh, good and cheap. Now, I had an amazing experience in Vancouver trying vegetarian food in a Tibetan restaurant and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. Not sure if the previous reviewers tried the vegetarian meals, but we thought they were bland. After trying amazing dumplings in Vancouver and my mom's pierogies, my boyfriend and I were disappointed with their vegetarian dumplings. The dumplings: the dough was good, but they mixed potatoes and other veggies together, creating a paste without much flavour, like they put everything in the same blender and cooked it thereafter. The pakoras' dough was sweet - not my favourite. The vegetarian cari lacked the freshness of the spices, you couldn't taste the flavours. Finally, instead of a naan bread they had a piece of a round bread I had already bought in a grocery. Just call it whatever, not naan bread. Otherwise, the mango and green tea ice creams were okay, but nothing to go crazy about. You guessed it: I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"C'était notre premier essai,la nourriture  était délicieuse et Mr Gelek nous a donné un accueil chaleureux !"}
{"text":"I'd had pretty good Tibetan food before so I came in with high hopes.  I wasn't really disappointed.  They accommodated my vegan palette with gusto and altered a few things to make them vegan, without complaint, eye rolling, or any of the other uncomfortable weirdness of some other restaurants.  My waiter?  He got it.  The waiter was charming and even though the place was absolutely packed and busy, he took his time to explain the meals to us and to ensure everything would be vegan-ified for me.  They have a Tibetan menu and an Indian menu.  My concern was that the Tibetan food would be a little bland as I've had some bland ass Tibetan food before.  I ordered a bunch of stuff - I honestly can't remember what everything was - but only one thing was a tad tasteless.  Hey, I won't lie, the vegetable curry was bland as hell, but the experience in general passed my litmus test.  Order some of the moist Tibetan bread that comes in this roll thing.  Just do it.  Sort of like Fruit-by-the-Foot style.  You dip it in your food and in sauces and stuff and it's delicious.  I loved it and it really hit the spot.  The samosas were also far superior to the samosas I'm accustomed to eating.  The dessert was a sweetened rice thing with raisins.  It was alright, but it normally comes with yogurt so of course the texture for me was a bit lacking; however, if you're not vegan, that won't concern you if you order it, of course.  While they did not have any Tibetan beer - the waiter explained to me that most Tibetan beers were home brews and they obviously couldn't sell that stuff in a restaurant - I must say that Tibetan food makes an excellent buffer before a night out drinking.  So yeah.  I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I found this venue through Yelp and it did not disappoint: delicious food, reasonable prices and a warm and welcoming waiter (owner?) made our dining experience a superb one. Highly recommended. Try the sweet bread and the cheese dumplings."}
{"text":"Simply the BEST lentil soup I've EVER had!The mo mos were simply delish as well; especially the beef with tamarind dipping sauce...YUM! Service was very personable and friendly,as well as very informative.We were a large group and they handled it very well,even though there were only 2 servers. Wonderful place, great food and service,reasonsonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute DELIGHT. Such warm + welcoming service - pure charm, all good vibes. The food was completely delicious. We had the blue cheese and lamb soup with naan bread as a starter, which was perfection. Then, a sampler of all the different types of momos (dumplings) which were artfully prepared, perfectly seasoned and came with the best mint sauce of life, I kid you not. We also had the chili chicken, which was also really, really tasty.  To top it all off, the prices are totally affordable. The wine selection leaves much to be desired, though, so next time I'll just stick with the super fresh mango lassie or the butter tea. This will be the place I take out of town friends from now on, and I'll be going back again to treat myself, too."}
{"text":"Great service!! Amazing food. Such a great experience. It was our first time ordering Tiberan food so we asked our server what he recommended. He recommended dishes that are common in Tibet and all of them were amazing. If you don't know what to order, I recommend asking the staff for recommendations. They are amazingly friendly and would be happy to help. No matter what though, you must order the momos!!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight. Love this place. The owners are lovely (and they have a cute tiny little kid who brought us an unsolicited can of 7-up mid-meal), the room is nice and quiet, and the food is on point--and there's a lot of it, which I wasn't expecting; we couldn't even finish it. But that beef-and-bean-noodles plate is sure going to look great to me tomorrow!  Get a salad, too. They make a delicious dressing, something with sesame oil? Anyway, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is great! The owner was very nice, the price was reasonable, and the food is made from scratch! We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I had no idea I loved Tibetan food until I ate here. To be fair, I haven't eaten there for a while and I forgot what it was that I ordered, but I just remember this feeling of sitting back after the meal with the biggest smile on my face. Give it a try, and I'm sure you'll feel the same."}
{"text":"Not knowing anything about Tibetan food and on the hunt for something different I thought I would give Tibetan Om a try.  Located right on Saint Laurent this is a affordable, simple restaurant cooking up Tibetan and Indian food.  They have standard Indian dishes that you would find in any Indian restaurant (curry, butter chicken, etc).  If you come here though try the Tibetan food.  They have a table d'hote which gets you a soup or salad, main, and dessert for about $20.  The lentil soup was well-seasoned and perfect for a cold, winter night.  I followed it up with momos which are a dumpling.  They offer a variety of fillings (beef, cheese, shrimp, vegetarian). I tried all of them and I have to say the cheese and beef ones were my favourite.  The cheese one was surprisingly sweet but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The service was pretty good except at the end of the meal when we had to flag down our waitress for dessert and the bills.  The owner though was incredibly friendly.  I really enjoyed the experience and would definitely come back in the future."}
