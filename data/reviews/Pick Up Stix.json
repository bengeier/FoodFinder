{"text":"Overwhelming usage of ginger on practically everything...fried rice, noodles, orange chicken and mildly on the House special ginger chicken.  Bourbon chicken and green beans were good."}
{"text":"I don't care what the other reviewers say, this place is really good.  The House Special Chicken is great.  This location is VERY clean and the food is always hot & tastes fresh.  They get a gold award every time from the health department."}
{"text":"Couldn't agree more with the majority of reviews. It's not good.  I had gone to Best Buy to buy a new fridge. Thirty minutes later I am standing in the hi-fi section persuading myself that what I really need is a kick ass stereo.  I decide to step outside to try and calm what could be an awful frenzy of spending. Pick Up Stix looks like a great place to grab a quick bite so I stop by.   Like so much fast food, it sounds good. Seems convenient. But of course you leave regretting your actions almost immediately. Still, it worked.   I have a new fridge."}
{"text":"Horrible orange chicken and fried rice. It costs $3 for a small drink and then another $1 for a refill which is ridiculous when there are free drinks in the casino. Staff needs customer service training and a cookbook. Worst Asian I have ever had."}
{"text":"I usually am not a picky eater and I love love love Chinese food. When we stayed in this hotel we ate here and it was awful. Everything tasted old and gross. The noodles were watery."}
{"text":"Pick up Stix was a quick dinner idea but after having the wonton soup I was digusted. It was like no other wonton soup i have ever seen. I will not make this mistake twice."}
{"text":"Horible service.  I know it is \"fast food\"  but they should realy treat the customer with respect. They just force us around then say good bye.  Food is ok at best."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience here! I always get takeout from this place because it's literally down the street from me. The food is always delicious, and you always get coupons for free appetizers (hello my little cream cheese wontons!) as long as you take a feedback survey online, which is really fast and really quick.  Some of my favorite dishes here: - Cream Cheese Wontons: If you don't try anything else here, you MUST order these. They are so delicious, especially with the dipping sauce they give you. - House Chicken Lunch Combos: Their lunch combos are an awesome deal. You get your choice of meat, white or brown rice, and then a side, like CREAM CHEESE WONTONS! (Just talking about the food is making me want to go get it!) - Szechaun Chicken - their new Kung Pao Chicken wings: I just tried these two days ago...if you get the combo, you get 8 wings, rice, and salad...the chicken was cooked to perfection, and was spicy and delicious.  So if you didn't get anything else from the review, I hope you at least understood that you need to try their cream cheese wontons...STAT! :)"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken it looks like it's the leftovers. service is horrible place at this place. Orange chicken I wouldn't feed my dog with lol. Never again !!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, its nothing like it use to be. This is probally the only one that serves there food like they do & its disgusting. Why open another pick up stix in las vegas but not have it the way it use to be when you would order and your food was freshly made?"}
{"text":"I came across this place by accident.  I took a class and was in need of some food for lunch.  Being that I was coming from out of town, I obviously didn't bring food with me for convenience so I came across Pick Up Stix and was game.  After all, I see the commercials for the place all the time, but never got the chance to check it out since I don't have any near me at home.    It wasn't too busy, met by a portly gentleman who took my order.  I went with the chow mein, shrimp and vegetables lunch combo with two vegetable dumplings.  The shrimp and vegetables were good, nice flavor, plenty of shrimp for a fast food joint.  The chow mein was a bit salty in my taste and I would have liked some vegetables with it.  The dumplings were OK, nothing spectacular, basically something you get from a fast food joint.  Service was pretty good as they brought the food to my table and then cashier/server was polite when she replaced the portly gentleman who appeared to be the manager.  Overall, it's decent, similar to Panda Express.  If I knew of good Chinese food in the area, I would go there first, but it's a nice alternative to the burger joints out there.  Not bad for my first time there except I wouldn't go with the chow mein again."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed when Pick Up Stix closes its locations around Vegas.   They made fresh food to order.   Now we get a mall version that is a pale imitation of the original.    I would recommend waiting for a fresh serving of any dish.  This location needs to step up its game.   China Max located around town is better than this joint right now."}
{"text":"What a shame this place is doomed. From a flavor perspective, I have never found such an interesting Asian/fusion style of food in a quick-serve setting. The food is remarkably rich and spicy, it's really refreshing to see a mass-market place be so bold. Being so deeply impressed initially, I really, really wanted to like this place. I have since given it about three or four tries. Yeah, not so much.  First of all, I'm not sure whether it's the quality of the meat, the parsimonious manner in which it's cut or some combination of the two, but their meat is always tough and stringy. When its breaded, the breading is inevitably chewy and hard because the meat inside the breading is so insubstantial that all the moisture gets sucked out in the frying process. Not even the chicken comes in substantial enough chunks to be juicy.   The amusing thing is, what made me like this place at the outset was the delicious sauces. You're enjoying the sauces so much you can easily overlook how crappy the meat is. Alas, that will only take them so far, as time and time again you are reminded of the crappy meat as you are compelled to floss vigorously.  Portions are another issue. They're too small for the price. Instead of takeout containers overstuffed with rice and entrees, grandma-sized portions are stingily arranged on a small plastic plate. I never have a problem finishing my entire meal and I always wish there was more.   I think Pick Up Stix has a bit of an identity crisis. On the one hand, they want to be Pei Wei, all flashy stainless steel and fancy real estate. On the other hand, come on folks, it's takeout faux-Chinese (\"pick\" \"up\" - see what they did there?). The best takeout faux-Chinese is always known for generous portions at low prices. At Pick Up Stix, you unfortunately get neither.  The patronage reflects my opinion about the place each time I go: it's always nearly empty. I really don't expect it to last. That's a shame, I really will miss the unique flavor profiles."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. They ignored us in line. They made food that they already had plenty of and did not make what they were out of. We had to ask twice how long till the honey chicken would be ready twice with no answer.   The noodle taste like Ramen Noodle flavor packs. The chicken was overcooked and my rice was burned. Horrible would never go back."}
{"text":"This place should be called Pick up Sodium.    Everything is over seasoned and high in Sodium.    The Beef and Broccli has 2190 grams of sodium on a 620 calorie dish!    The chicken teriyaki bowl with white rice has 4200 grams.   Samurai Sam's chicken teriyaki bowl, large has 940 grams, while the regular bowl has 520 grams.   Skip this place."}
{"text":"Don't go here for a late night fix - they close earlier than stated/advertised. When questioned about it their staff said their clocks said it was closing time - perhaps their clock is 10 minutes fast, or the staff was just trying to close up a wee bit early...  Maybe for the best - unlike any other location I've visited (and I'm normally a raving fan of Pick Up Stix), all the food at this location isn't made fresh to order. It's pre-made and sits in warming trays. I'll need to go to the LA area to get my fix."}
{"text":"Worst food in Las Vegas so far in the four days I have been here. I ordered the chicken egg rolls. It was putrid.... chicken????? is that what it was suppose to be? Good thing Cinnabon is next door."}
{"text":"We love Pick Up Stix!!! Everything is wok made for you when you order it. Their chicken entrees are very good, but I always order Buddha's Feast, a vegetable dish. You have your choice of white or brown rice with every meal. Excellent food - well worth the visit!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch recently.  They give you a number and bring your food to the table when it's ready.  I had to wait about five minutes, but it was worth it.  My Chicken Teriyaki bowl served over brown rice was excellent, and only $5.29 (about $2 cheaper than Samurai Sams).  I prefer the healthier brown rice because I think it tastes better, but you can order white rice if you prefer .  You can also ask for the teriyaki sauce on the side, and they give you a generous portion.    I also found out they have tasty cream cheese wontons, normally 3 for $2.29 or 6 for $4.39.  There happened to a special on them when I was there last -- only 25 cents each.     If you a want tasty, inexpensive, asian-style meal, I recommend Pick up Stix."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth your time or money despite being a \"cheaper\" option. It's my fault for craving Asian food at an old resort, but this isn't even up to Panda Express' standard.   I ordered a 3-item combo so I could use one of my rewards coupons for a free drink, and it was a pitiful waste of $10.  I was better off getting $10 spicy McChickens.   Vegetable fried rice was poorly cooked. Kind of soggy and grainy.   The Kung Pow chicken was mostly water chestnuts and cardboard carrots.   The \"premium\" extra dollar Thai shrimp was okay at best with plenty of onions.   The beef broccoli was the best thing I had. The broccoli was cooked well but I don't even remember having much beef.   So upsetting. Luckily I can use this as a business write off.   Excuse me as I use the restroom to get rid of what I just ate."}
{"text":"Worst place I would say to get food, food sucks with no flavor and the the servers were rude and not friendly and food bone in the chicken not coming back here !!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service considering they just had to scoop the food into containers and the food was so salty i couldnt even eat it all... Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I spent 34.00 on a dinner last night....orange chicken.....eeeeh ok .....white rice was ok...my daughter got spring rolls and told me to taste because it tasted funny.  I took one bite and apt it out in front of evewryone!  Nasty Nasty Nasty. What a terrible taste... I might as well have chewed on a dirty bar rag.....Horrid.   The employees were very nice...and all did the uosell uosell upsell uosell upsell upsell upsell.....on a positive note....I am not throwing up....."}
{"text":"You may ask what more there is to say about Pick Up Stix than what chris r has already said, and ordinarily you'd be right.  But my experience there compels me to write so much more...  So we walked up to the door.  I'm right handed so I pulled on the right door, but it didn't open.  Then I pushed.  No open.  Was there a sign?  No.  But ppl were working inside, so i went to the left door and it worked.  Next, I went to order.  Order our house special!! Okay, sure.  Tell me what it looks like.  So the lady points at the pic on the menu, a dish replete with veggies and meat and sauce.  Then she tells me that the house special does not have any veggies in it except green onions.  Ooooooookay...  So i order something else, whatever it was.    Three weeks later our food comes...  It included an egg roll which didn't taste like the typical egg roll.  Appropriate, because it was served with (*outrage!*) yellow sweet and sour sauce!    Look.  This isn't food network, and you aren't iron chef.  You are pick up stix and your s&s sauce should be that recognizable, iridescent red like all other s&s sauces.  don't trip.  The rest of the food was in a soup of goo that made the flavor pretty uniformly overpowering and unsavory.  Don't go to pick up stix.  You have been duly warned.  (Good for: Breakfast___ Lunch___ Dinner___Brunch___Late Night___Dessert___Nothing_X_)    UPDATE: 4 hours later, my mouth still smells like an elephant ate a pound of garlic and then crapped in my mouth.  My wife refuses to be near me.  My two month old cries when I try to hold him.  I'm a pariah.  Thank you, pick up stix."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in town.  The food is fantastic.  My favorites include,  House Special Chicken House Special Beef House Special Fried Rice Orange Peel Chicken Wonton Soup Cream Cheese Wontons Chow Mein Also, I've never had bad service in this place and we've ate there probably 3 times a month for the past 4 years.  They've also came out with a combo menu and do little promotions like won-ton Wednesdays where the won-tons are only 25 cents.  Really a great place to eat.  The only downside is that it's always busy and seating is at a minimum.  If you don't mind eating outside there's a patio that's really nice in the spring and fall, but in the hot vegas summers it's really a drag."}
{"text":"I guess I was one the lucky ones.  I had ordered the Kung pao chicken, the green beans, and the noodles.  I guess when I got them they were fresh because they tasted good.  They were a little salty but that was expected.  My girlfriend said the orange chicken was hard as a rock.  After she mentioned that, I thought it looked a little dried out in the pan.  I would suggest getting the non battered/glazed chicken to be safe.  Or make sure you ask if it is fresh.  As for service,it was awful.  The workers were not happy.  Overall, I probably would not eat here again."}
{"text":"My previous visits to this place left me quite unimpressed but recently there seems to have been a marked improvement in the food quality. The ingredients are fresher and the food is tastier. Service is friendly and the place itself remains clean, spacious, and bright as before."}
{"text":"I come typically come here when I'm at Excalibur because the food is decent, depending on what you get. The food is Asian fusion but some of it is way too oversauced and salty. But for some reason I still like to come here...probably because it's the only location in Vegas. If given an option though, I'd probably choose Panda Express over this Pick Up Stix."}
{"text":"We ordered beef & broccoli when it was literally served with only 1 piece of beef. Which the lady told us \"that's how it is\". This does not deserve any stars. Food didn't taste fresh at all!!!!! I don't recommended going at all."}
{"text":"I order  general chicken, beef and broccoli and also string beans! Half and half on the noodle and rice! I got to say this is the worst Chinese fast food I been to! I wish I should just go to Panda Express! This place is really salty and I don't even think they know how to cook Chinese food! Very disappointed! Don't ever go here!"}
{"text":"I can't say this is anything special.  Ordered steamed rice, the \"house chicken\", and broccoli beef.  I exchanged my third entrée for potstickers.  Broccoli beef had a decent amount of flavor in the traditional brown sauce, but this was the only thing I would recommend.  The house chicken stated that garlic and soy flavors were present, but I detected neither.  Rice was made in a batch that was far too large.  Clumpy and dried pieces.  I was interested in the Kung Pao chicken, but it looked like zucchini was included.  Haven't seen much true Kung Pao in years.  Condiments (even soy sauce) is hoarded behind the counter which slows down an already slow process.  Might have better luck at the popcorn stand."}
{"text":"Don't go there if your staying at the excaliber hotel even if your going to just get a little snack before or after taking ur kids to go to the fun dungeon there food is not great and they even give small proportions not like panda express it's like the more expensive but generic version of it!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Pick Up Stix and it's certainly superior to that steam table garbage they try to pass off as Chinese food at Panda Express. Of course, it helps that the food is made to order.   I  also like the variety of their menu which includes salads, noodle dishes, lunch combinations and regular dinner entrees.  Having brown rice as an option is always a good thing.  I had the Thai Spicey Chicken Dragon Meal ($4.99) which is an individual portion (although I ate it in three portions, it was huge), brown rice and a side salad.  Delicious and not extremely spicey.  If you visit their website, you can download coupons and order online.  Service was fast and friendly, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is really gross and it's expensive (cuz it's Vegas). My friend and I shared a fried rice and two sides of kung pao chicken and veggies. The fried rice was really salty, the kung pao chicken and veggies were just ok. To say the least, we wasted a lot of food. My friend wasn't feeling well from our partying the night before, so she didn't want to eat Popeye's, which our guy friends got. I think I'd MUCH rather prefer fried chicken. Pick Up Stix is pretty much another Panda Express...gross, unauthentic food. Sigh."}
{"text":"Pick Up Stix is another \"fast\" Chinese restaurant.  Not as fast as a Panda Express, but more like a Pei Wei with a more casual atmosphere.  The give very generous portions, with lots of veggies.  I frequently order sweet and sour chicken at any Chinese restaurant, and this was one of the best."}
{"text":"Did I end up here on a bad day.. Id only been to one other Pick Up Stix, in San Diego.. so I was hoping for more.. end of story.. nothing to report.. just go there with espresso in the system..because its sleepy.. the menu and the people were just.. eh.. the food.. they forgot my sauces for the wontons.. and the dressing for my salad.. Never noticing til I got it home.. so when I rate as , \"Ive seen and had better.. \" trust me.. I have"}
{"text":"This was the worst Asian restaurant I have ever been to. I got that Bourbon Chicken. I might as well ordered chicken and sugar water. I admittedly threw it away the fastest $9 I have ever given away. Stay away it's better to go somewhere  else!!!!"}
{"text":"I agree with Sheila... this place is better than Panda Express. But in the way that manslaughter is better than murder. Both are bad, but one has a lesser sentence."}
{"text":"I was craving Panda Express so I decided to make due with Pick Up Stix since we were staying at Excalibur. It was a terrible decision. I ordered the chow mein with green beans and some kind of chicken.  Everything on my tray was extremely salty and oily. Not only was the quality of the food lower than Panda Express, the price was also more expensive. $10 for a meal full of oil and salt? No thank you. Will definitely not be returning here ever again."}
{"text":"If you like all your food sweet, this is your joint. I went with a group of three. The other two really liked their food, I did not. To my palette, all the dishes were overly sweet and terribly bland. I prefer more savory fare in the mix. And, call me crazy, I like to be able to distinguish individual flavors. The food was inexpensive, but that's all it had going for it."}
{"text":"I am adding a star to Pick Up Stix in my updated review. I have found myself coming here about once a week; initially, because it's such a short drive from mi casa. Since the Kung Pao Chicken was so average the last time I visited, I thought I try some different items on the menu.  The House Noodles which include beef, chicken and shrimp are yummy. But my new favorite is the Mongolian Beef. I don't smoke, but I was craving a cigarette after inhaling my most recent meal of Mongolian Beef and House Noodles; a body quaking foodgasm that made my day."}
{"text":"Need a quick fix but a change from Panda Express?  This place is different in that the food is cooked to order, and fast.  For my first experience here, Pick up Stix didn't disappoint.  I liked their food more than Panda Express in terms of fast Asian food, especially because they cook it to order, so the food is nice and piping hot when you get it.  I decided to try their honey chicken and some chicken chow mein, not expecting it to be huge portion sizes.  They were family sized, definitely.  Seven bucks can feed 2 to 3 people!  Not bad for fast chinese food.    Chicken chow mein: next time I'll order just veggie because they put a ton of chicken in there, but overall it was good mall quality fast chow mein.  A bit salty but with that slight hint of sweetness in the background, their chow mein was piping hot in that novelty chinese food box and was fun to eat out of it (I ordered to go).  Onions were nicely seared and cooked just right, and lots of celery and carrots and green onion, too.  Not bad.  Honey Chicken: I was shocked at how nice and crispy it was despite the sauce.  Tangy and sweet, nicely spiced, it was a great pick.  It was much better than the mall chinese places and definitely better than panda express, so I was happy.  I was honestly shocked as to how crispy it was because most places have things like this but they are already soggy.  Cooked to order makes a huge difference.  This was a great break from Panda Express when I needed fast chinese mall food.  If you want genuine, of course this isn't the place to go.  If you want fast chinese food, this might be another good choice on your list.  Stop by and you get a coupon for a free entree with a purchase of another, too.  I\"ll probably come back again when I'm not in the mood to cook and want quick Chinese food.  Give it a try for fun."}
{"text":"Wow, seems I should've read reviews first! All of the food in this food court was pretty unappealing so we gave it a shot. 3 meats and much of it all tasted the same. Ended up throwing out most of the container.  Best thing I had was the bottle of water."}
{"text":"As others have stated, this food court at the Excalibur has potential, especially when one is simply looking to grab something fast.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, this is really the only decent lunch option, and it was pretty bad.  I'd arrived at the Excalibur at around 1 p.m. and I simply wanted to grab a quick bite, as I had some things to do and was planning to meet friends for a larger meal later that night.  I came here, got the orange chicken, fried rice and a soft drink.   EVERYTHING they had in the pans in the display looked to be dried out, as if it was cooked hours earlier and had been sitting under warming lamps, or in baking pans ever since. The fried rice I got was OK, but the portion of orange chicken I got was pretty tiny, and while most of the pieces were fine, there was one that was a 2 inch round ball of breading with an undercooked piece of chicken in the center.  Needless to say I left that on the plate.    For a small portion of dried out orange chicken and fried rice in a Styrofoam container and a small soft drink, I paid more than $10.  Horrible."}
{"text":"We love Pick up Stix back in Orange County. Nothing, I mean nothing the same.  Food was drowning in grease and cold.  We felt sick for hours!!"}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would... A three side plate is 8.99 the serving is small and all the food is beyond greasy and salty. I never knew green beans could be soooo horribly drenched in oil and salt!!! :( please please do yourself a favor and do not come here... The girls working had the most sour of attitudes and looked sounded like they were hating life and their existence ... There are better fast food options within walking , tram and taxi distance"}
{"text":"Well I went in here yesterday, it was close to my work so i figured why not? The food was delicious, hot and fresh BUT it took fooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeevvvvvvvvvvvvverrrrrrrrrrrrr to get my food i had an hour lunch and i didnt even get to finish eating... wont be going back there again at lunch time!"}
{"text":"Terrible! I love chinese food and Pick up Stix, I don't love you. Their chowmein was good, their fried rice was good, but the chicken was terrible. I had chow mein with orange chicken and bourbon chicken. Orange chicken was bad, couldn't even finish it because it was so bad. However, the bourbon chicken (if you decided to try it yourself) is actually probably their only good option because it was delicious. My boyfriend got chow mein and fried rice with beef broccoli and orange chicken. His beef broccoli was more leftover soysauce than actual beef, and when he did find some beef, it was tiny. What the hell?   The food was not good, I will never come back to this restaurant. I did enjoy the potstickers, but expensive for those so not in a hurry to come back for those.   Also weird service, the girl serving the food doesn't give enough of the 1st and 2nd options (ex: chickens, not the chowmein or rice). She hardly gave my boyfriend anything and the girl serving drinks, overfilled everyone's drink, maybe they should switch jobs.   Pick Up Stix if you are reading this my suggestion for better food is to keep your chow mein recipe, keep your bourbon chicken, and the fried rice, but change that orange chicken recipe, that killed it and offer different potstickers. Also, make sure your servers are serving enough food for those options, because we don't want to be just eating soysauce when we're supposed to eat broccoli and beef.. I recommend Schlotsky's and even McDonald's over this restaurant at the Excalibur food court."}
{"text":"This gave me bubble gut for hours, I had the runs and could not stop barfing  very very icky"}
{"text":"Can someone re-staff their employees? A young guy named \"Jetski\" gave my husband and I the worst costumer service we have ever gotten and we are from NY. Food was decent but for 2 meals, 2 drinks it came to $38. I asked for the 3 combo meal and Jetski was standing there talking about how cool his name is when I tell him \" I'll take the firecracker chicken\" and he said \" your talking to me?\" And I said yes, I'm ordering my food, I want that chicken. Then he goes and says I don't think he's funny. HE'S right! He's not funny at all and should be fired for lack of common social skills! My god, 20 mins later and I'm eating overpriced food that gave me a headache before i even ate it!"}
{"text":"Pick Up Stix is not as popular as some of the other fast Chinese restaurants but is still very good. For first timers who are not sure what to get, go with the \"House Chicken\" it is incredible and happens to be there specialty. The lunch special is hard  to beat that Jake C. mentioned. The only bad part is that it only includes the \"House Chicken\" so for the few of you out there who don't like it might be out of luck. If you are picking up, be sure to call a head because you might be waiting for a while otherwise."}
{"text":"One of the new places in the food court that is still undergoing renovation in the Excalibur Hotel. They currently have a deal (coupon required) in which you can get a free medium drink with the purchase of a 2 chicken item combo. Good place to eat at if you just want a quick and cheap meal. I prefer this place more than Panda Express."}
{"text":"By far thee most disgusting \"asian\" food I've ever had. Like are you serious, how is this place even still open?? Waste of money and not to mention how soggy the noodles were and the orange chicken oh God horrible!!"}
{"text":"Came here starving. Ordered a 3 item combo and and order of cream cheese wontons . Went to my room to enjoy my $20 meal and was highly disappointed. This food had to be sitting there for hours. It tasted like horrible left overs. Dry, saturated in sauce. It wasn't hot. It definitely was NOT fresh. It tasted really old. I felt like if I ate this I would get sick. And the lady that served me didn't look to pleased to be there. Basically I paid $20 for wontons because that's all I ate. Very, very disappointed. If I wasn't so tired I would have went back and demanded my money back."}
{"text":"Just under$4 for a one-item craving at midnight isn't a bad deal. Husband and I circled the Excalibur food court on foot a couple of times before I settled on fast-Asian (over McD's, Popeye's, Schlotzky's, a smoothie place, Krispy Kreme, or Auntie Anne's).  Having no other meatless options I ordered just the fried green beans. They looked so over fried I sampled one first (samples are free, just ask). Thinking I could handle a full order I went for it. I finished off the night's supply. ($3.77)  A couple oil-soaked napkins later and a LOT of oily sauce at the bottom of my container and I ditched the beans for a much healthier donut. (Not kidding. Def healthier).   Friendly service, especially for the time off night, but at least have one mixed vegetable option! (No, veggie fried rice doesn't count). I regret my food and restaurant choices."}
{"text":"So little food for a good amount of money. And for the love of God stay away from their orange chicken. Its horrible. Yoshinoya has better orange chicken and that's not saying much. Their orange chicken taste horrible and will leave a bad taste in your mouth. I will probably not eat here again"}
{"text":"Good or bad review depends on what you order.  Bad = low quality meat in treacle-like sweet sauce. If I wanted a motherfucking candy bar I'd get a snickers.  Kthx.  Pretty good = their vegetarian stuff in the white wine sauce. If you ask twice and speak slowly, they'll make it with soft and not deep fried tofu. It's pretty healthy and very tasty, and pairs nicely with their brown rice.  Before you accuse me of vegetarian bias bitches, know that I think there's room for all of god's animals... right there next to the mashed potatoes.  Just not at Pick Up Stix."}
{"text":"Every Pick Up Stix is the same, so I knew what I was getting when I picked up food here: very tasty Chinese food.  I think their \"House Special Chicken\" is unlike any other Chinese dish, so I usually get that.  Mixed with rice, that easily makes two meals for me.  While the food is good here, though, it's nothing amazing.  And I much prefer ordering from an independent Chinese restaurant, so I don't come here that often.  Definitely a top choice when shopping in \"Best In The West\" and want to grab a meal after."}
{"text":"This place is like any other takeout Chinese place, only it has the clean, slightly less greasy feel of a chain, with the prices and expediency of a independently owned restaurant. I strongly recommend the lunch special, which gets you a drink, rice, lunch portion of (some chicken dish), and an appetizer for $6.99.   The food isn't exceptional enough for the fifth star, but the prices and convenience almost get it there."}
{"text":"Generic, flavorless food. Don't let the open kitchen fool you; this is Panda Express without the cafeteria style line. Disappointed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"this probably hands down one of the freshest food court meals I have ever had in Las Vegas. and I'm aas Vegas native. I also would like to comment on Ariannas customer service she is world class and any business is lucky to have her."}
{"text":"Yes, this is basically Panda Express... however, we enjoyed it. Keeping in mind that this is food court food. The noodles were great and so was the bourbon chicken. This is coming from a group of Asians. We liked it so much we went back later for late night food. For the price, portion, and convenience this was what we wanted when we couldn't decide while hungry."}
{"text":"We were not expecting much from a fast food type Asian cuisine place and this one lived up to our expectations. A very young disinterested crew was on duty with no obvious leadership in place. They were more interested in talking about their personal lives than giving prompt attention. A pass thru window allowed us to watch horseplay in the kitchen while the food pans ran empty up front. This caused us to have to wait even longer to get our food. When we finally got our food it was hot...and fresh and that's about the only positive thing about most of it. Rice was under cooked and crunchy the noodles were no better than a package of ramen available anywhere for under a quarter. Most dishes were heavily salted or drowned in so much soy sauce that's all you could taste. The price point was about the best thing about this meal but felt I overpaid with the quality of food and service. I feel I would have been better off going to the McDonalds just to the left of it. At least when I go there I pretty much know what I'm going to get...."}
{"text":"Just wasn't a fan at all.  Can't say I've ever enjoyed pick up stix.  The service was always less than acceptable :p. But that's just me"}
{"text":"Did I just eat the dead sea? Aka the sea with the highest concentration of salt on earth? Cuz this food was salty :("}
{"text":"This is like a low-grade panda express, and that's saying something.  I ordered the 2 item combo, and it was almost $10 without a drink.  They did let me get half rice and half noodles and then I opted for the Bourbon Chicken and Kung Pow Chicken.  The rice and noodles were bland and awful.  The kung pow chicken only had four pieces of chicken in the whole scoop.  It was all vegetables.  The bourbon chicken was decent, but my mall foodcourt has better bourbon chicken.  Only went here because it was attached to the casino I was staying in.  Would never go back.  Man, those noodles were gross.... ::shudders::"}
{"text":"Not very good at all,  it is like a wanta be panda express, noodles are terrible!!!! Drink refill was $1.40."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  Pick Up Stix, you need to pick up your attitude, show some smiles,  and stop hating your job.  I came here twenty minutes prior to closing.  They had run out of most of their food, but there was still a huge line.  I ordered the kung pao chicken and the orange chicken.  There were almost no other options.  They were rationing what little food they had to the customers waiting in line.  Everyone surely did not get what they paid for.  The staff members that were packing the boxes were extremely rude and seemed like they rather be doing something else.  The owner needs to work with these employees, and either needs re-train them in customer service, or fire them.    As for the food, there was very little in the box.  The fried rice was hard and grainy.  The noodles were overly sauced, and salty.  The orange chicken was too sweet, and was soggy.  The kung pao chicken was all sauce and vegetables.  It was overall very disgusting.  The food was terrible, served alongside terrible service."}
{"text":"unfortunately Pick Up stix is closed all their locations in AZ and in NV. I never understand. I loved this place. 1000x better than the Panda or Pei Wei.. heck i liked it better than P.F Changs which all belong to the same company. put it this way... its where I spent my 2008 Valentine's Dinner I liked it that much. Ah well.. I guess I'll have to hit up San Diego to eat it once again.."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 stars if I could!!!!  I Was So Upper When I Came Here Because There Is A Pick Up Stix Where I Live In Cali and it is AMAZING! !!!! I LOVE It! !!!! Such good, fresh food that they make right when you order it. The one in Excalibur in Vegas was fast food Panda express style and the food looked so greasy and nasty that I wouldn't even touch it with a ten foot pole! !!!!! The food looked like it was coated in mineral oil and they didn't even have tofu!!!!!!!!  I am going to complain to the awesome one in cali and tell them to fix it cuz it's a sad world when the people can't enjoy delicious pick up stix in Sin City........"}
{"text":"We have been eating there for a long time they closed up all of them in AZ :( I liked the place because it was clean and made fresh. The place was booming every time I went in there not sure what the deal was. Phoenix is going down the economic tubes."}
{"text":"Had lunch there, it was good although the price was high vs. the amount of food :X though very friendly employees and the food was good non the less i would agree that its better than Panda but nothing to special :)"}
{"text":"Exactly like Panda express. Nothing too special, flavoring and food options were all the same if you were to compared to boot-leg Chinese-American fast food restaurants.   Greasy, fatty, and no fresh. Feels like the food had been sitting there for a while on a heater.   This is located in a hotel, 2nd floor on their food court. It's definitely convenient."}
{"text":"Great fast Chinese food.  But the last time I came, for some reason, it wasn't fast at all.  The manager came out to apologize, and brought us free cream cheese wontons or puffs? Not sure, but they were crispy and delicious, so that eased our troubles away.  The manager also gave us a coupon for another free order of those crispy little wonders next time we come.  I hope my food is slow again next time!  5 Stars for customer service alone, but I did have to chop one star off for not really enjoying the spicy veggie dish I got.  Everything else I've tried here is really good and I recommend this place when you want Chinese on the fly.  Keep in mind that it's kinda pricey for being an order-at-the-counter joint, unless you come at lunch."}
{"text":"Salty food, grumpy looking workers.  the pick up stix in my hometown is pretty good but this one in Vegas-NOT!"}
{"text":"I think that Pick Up Stix uses much better quality ingredients than Panda Express and many other Asian fast food chains and is fairly affordable given the quality. Their lunch special is a particularly good deal - you get a choice between 3-4 specific meat dishes, a choice of wontons or egg rolls, a choice between different rices or chow mein, and a drink for $6.99. The House Special Chicken has a really flavorful sauce and is great combined with sauteed veggies (for $1 more), and the crab wontons are much better than ones I've had at many Asian restaurants that have kind of a fishy or overly creamy filling. However, echoing what some people have already said, the noodle dishes are not great here and should probably be avoided."}
{"text":"Brad T. said it best when he called it a happy medium between Panda Express and Pei Wei. It's 100% Americanized without an ounce of authenticity but damn it's cheap, it's fast and it tastes good!    My favorite is the house special chicken (similar to General Tso but tastier!), and my second favorite is the crispy honey. Yup, I like the 2 most unhealthy items on the menu - big surprise !   So the thing to order here is the Wok Combos. For $6-$7, you get an entree of your choice (House Special chicken!), a side (the highly mentioned cream cheese wontons), AND rice or noodles (Egg fried noodles baby). It's a high calorie, highly indulgent feast of Americanized \"chinese\" goodness!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place as we missed the \"real\" restaurant version since it closed its location on Flamingo. This was NOTHING like the stand alone restaurant. They had the same options but did not taste anything like it. The meats were really bland and there was too much ginger in the noodles. They didn't even have the yummy potsticker sauce I remember from the old place. They just had a sweet and sour sauce that was not very good. We definitely will not be eating there again."}
{"text":"I made a mistake, I made a mistake. I should be required to write this 100 times to remind myself how much I really don't like Pick Up Stix. I was desperate and hungry. I made a mistake.  While the lunch special PRICE is good the food is not. The beef with broccoli should be called beef with broccoli and a cup of sugar. It's WAY too sweet. The fried rice is bland as was the egg roll.   Hey, there was one good thing they had free refills on soda. WOO-HOO!   If you're really, really hungry and there's nothing else open you'd be better off eating a piece of stale bread."}
{"text":"Was so yummy, we ate there twice during our stay! Tried the orange chicken, house chicken, bourbon chicken, firecracker chicken, orange chicken, fried rice, and lo mein.  Best Chinese food court restaurant, hands down! Prices are reasonable and servings are very generous; hubby and I shared the 3 entree plate ($10.99) both times and were stuffed!"}
{"text":"My son and I had dinner here..  Should have gone to Subway in the same plaza.  Or Panda.  Food is OK here, but I could find 100 places I'd rather eat."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!! Took over an hour for delivery. Uber eats driver took the slowest route, and when I finally get my food, my egg rolls that I really wanted wasn't in there..smh. If I could rate this this place 0 I would.  The employees sucked!!!! And there's no napkins! Wtf!!!??"}
{"text":"There is nothing special about Pick Up Stix.  The food is pretty standard and nothing is extremely good.  It acts and tastes like Pei Wei but without the obnoxious layout.  The food comes out quick and is decently priced.    The Pick Up Stix on 67th is the first one I had ever been to.  We would usually call ahead and they would always have our order ready for us when we arrived.  Orange chicken and the Honey chicken are two of my favorites although they are a far cry from the Chinese food at China Chili.  This place is always reliable for quick food when I am in NoPho."}
{"text":"This Pick Up Stix is one of the worst for quality.  I can order the same dish and, somehow, over the span of a week, it can be completely different.  Sometimes the food will have onions, sometimes it won't.  Some days the chicken will look fried, some days it will look defrosted.  Whatever, you get what you pay for, but this is my least favorite of a usually reliable chain."}
{"text":"I know Pick Up Fork wouldn't be as clever of a name but even after dating a Japanese American man for 11 years, I've yet to master the \"Stix\". We stopped in here post vitamin shopping-pre Marshall's shopping. I can shop for pills on an empty stomach but clothing? Nevah! I had VERY low expectations (Think Panda Express meets Lean Cuisine Asian Collection). The employee was very helpful in helping us decide on the lunches offered. I went with a crispy and light lemon chicken with fried rice and two cream cheese won tons. Delightful! Rickie was pleased with his dish though for the life of me I cannot remember what it was. And I must say I liked it better than Pei Wei which I keep trying for some reason and always feel ill afterwards! Like watching Big Brother. Ugh! For around seven bucks, not a bad deal and you don't have to fight the unrly, stroller-filled food court Panda Express crowd."}
{"text":"Jet ski and tamerin were absolutely amazing. Jet ski had me laughing throughout the whole order, definitely made my day."}
{"text":"If only I could give this place a negative star. Fried Rice and chow mein were disgusting so I tried to drown out that taste with the Orange chicken.... Orange chicken turned out worse! Waste of money. First was a little upset about how little of food they give you but now I'm really glad they didn't like that crap on. If you are staying at the Excalibur I highly recommend DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I tried this place last night and I'm in-between a 3 and a 4.  I think I may try this place again but I went over here last night as a craving.  I used to live in Chandler area and that pick up stix was always good to me and this one doesn't quite do it but I think I'll give it a 2nd chance later.  I got my food to-go and I was pretty happy with how fast I got my food.  It was a little shy of 5 minutes which seems okay to me.  Last night, they had a special of .25 per cheese wonton.  So I went ahead and got some of those.  Typical for dinner, the portions were a good size for one person.  In the end, I like that there are plenty of vegetables and nuts in my kung pao chicken but the spicy orange something chicken?  That was just meat and in a smaller container.   Bottom line, I wanted brown rice and some chinese food and I got exactly what I wanted last night and it tasted good and nearby to me."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying their honey chicken is great, but that's were it all ends.  The orange chicken and fried rice tasted over cooked and burned.  At $8.99 for a combo I expected better and I have had better at other locations.  This location dropped the stix!  Never Again."}
{"text":"Rice wasn't cooked all the way. The servers were really nasty and didn't act professional."}
{"text":"When I got the flu a few weeks ago, I made my husband pick up Chinese from here and not some of the other places because I remember liking this place a lot like 10 years ago when my mother lived in the anthem village area and I was staying with her.  However, I thought that location was on Eastern near Smiths where Cook on Wok is now, but it doesn't seem to be there anymore.  I'm not sure if I'm getting this place mixed up with another!  Anyway I had him get me the won ton soup, shrimp with vegetables, and the house special beef with vegetables.  I was not a fan of the broth used in the won ton soup, I've had much better around town.  The shrimp with vegetables was good, nothing extraordinary about it.  However, I was a huge fan of the house special beef.  I want to try the chicken next time, I think.  While this probably wasn't worth sending my husband out to green valley blvd to pick up, if I'm in the area I would go here again."}
{"text":"I went here about a year ago and then went again about 5 months ago and both times my noodle (chicken low mein) tasted like dirt water.  I don't get it?  How do they get that specific dirt taste so perfectly? I gave 2 stars b/c my fiance's dish was good tasting but I don't remember what he had.  I just remember thinking, \"this doesn't taste like dirt... so I must like it\".  Anyhow, I suppose there is consistency."}
{"text":"I have a fairly 'Americanized' taste buds, so please take this with a grain of salt.  ;)  I loved my dinner take out order of Mongolian Beef.  It was very flavorful without being too spicy for me.  The portions are plentiful and I only had a ten minute wait.  I'm assuming that I would have no wait if I had ordered ahead, online, but I didn't know that at the time.  The menu has many different options from bland to hot.   Next time, I may have to try the cream cheese filled wontons since they look more like a dessert instead of an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Yeah, the 3 item combo I got here left me feeling lousy. Usually Chinese food is a safe bet, but here it was just gross. All the chicken (honey, orange, garlic) were either too sweet AND too salty or just underwhelming. Yeah, go someplace else, hell, I'd even recommend Popeyes and McDonalds. The fried rice was alright though (even though it could have done with less soy sauce)."}
{"text":"Can't believe how bad this place is as far as order accuracy and priority.  Watched a 3-top get their food before mine, and I had one simple order.  Then some guy storms in, complains his takeout order was wrong, and then people who order after him wait forever to get their food.  It's as if we all lose at this place.  Food is nothing special either, a clearly inferior option to Pei Wei across the street in both quality and service.  Some of the folks working there are polite, but politeness doesn't make your tummy ache go away when you see groups of people who ordered after you receive their food first."}
{"text":"My lomein was average nothing special. My dinner partner was disappointed with the lack of being able to pick and chose items for her meal.   We both thought it tasted very good/fresh. We will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"When you want some pseudo fast-food chinese and want a step up from Panda, Pick up Stix is the way to go my friends. Whether it be one of their awesome lunch specials for under $10 or a few a-la-carte items for dinner, they never seem to disappoint.   Below are some of my favorites:  -House Special Beef (a-la-carte or lunch special) -House special chicken -Cream cheese wontons  Personally this place is like the happy medium between a Panda Express and Pei-Wei (And what is so great about pei-wei anyway? Someone please tell me!)"}
{"text":"Pick Up Stix is back! All Las Vegas area locations closed a while back, and I was a little heartbroken. I love their fried rice and cream cheese won tons! When I heard about the Excalibur location, I was excited to get some of my beloved fried rice. Never mind having to drive to the Strip to get it, I was committed. The food court has been remodeled and is not hard to get to on the 2nd floor of the casino. I was diasappointed that this is a quick serve layout, which means a Panda Express type layout instead of the traditional made to order Pick Up Stix I love. Alas, they had fried rice but you can't get it with plan shrimp or chicken, only with the fancy entree items such as orange chicken or spicy shrimp. The employee was very helpful as she saw my diasappointment at the offerings, and she told me about the kid's meal with fried rice. This is not posted on the menu, and it was a pretty good deal. The fried rice was a little different than I remember, but was good enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately Yelp won't let me give it zero stars. For serving raw food and denying a refund even when I presented my credit card they should be sued. I just didn't have the energy or patience to do that. The staff is rude And the place is terrible. Located in the Excalibur food court. Don't go!"}
{"text":"Apparently I went to a different Pick Up Stix than Richard and Chris.  *checks receipt*  Nope. Same one.  Anyway, I didn't have any trouble with the doors, I don't really care too much about the color of sweet and sour sauce so long as it tastes good, and I wasn't expecting anything above and beyond Panda Express. It's Asian fast food. I had moderate expectations.  I got better than moderate results.  The food was quite good. My girlfriend who is incredibly picky about chicken wings had tried the house special wings just hours before at the Camelback location while out and about and wanted more. This location was closer to home, so I went there and picked up stuff aside from the wings.  We got egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, and wonton soup, all of which were very good. Nothing gourmet about it, mind you, but very good.  Teresa, the woman taking orders at the front counter, was friendly and helpful. Not overly so, but I didn't feel like she was completely bored with the world, either. The guys in the kitchen worked fast and got the food to me within a very few minutes (about 5 is what it felt like, but I wasn't counting). I picked it up at the counter and went on my way home for some delicious food that stood up to microwave reheating the next day for lunch.  Not a huge variety of food, but what they serve seems to turn out quite well. I've been to the Camelback location a couple of times. This is my first at the Chandler location. I've yet to be disappointed.  **Added August 4, 2009: Went back to the same location a couple nights later to try their beef teriyaki bowl and chicken fried rice. Again, both quite good, though there was too much sauce on the teriyaki."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. I recommend house chicken, honey chicken, and the bourbon chicken. I don't like the noodles or fried rice so I opt for white rice instead!"}
