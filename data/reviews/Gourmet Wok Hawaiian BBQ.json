{"text":"This place has THE BEST and most DELICIOUSLY INSANE Chinese food. It is so inexpensive as well and brought back so many memories for me. My family and I used to come here when we wanted a quick fix for Chinese food and it tastes so much better than Panda express.

I have been around trying other Chinese food joints and restaurants but nothing truly compares to what they have here. Its even remotely close to a Bank Of America, a food for less, stop and shop and not too far from trader joes so if you're grocery shopping in the area or need a bank those would also be the places to hit up.

The food is definitely worth the money that you pay for it. Its cheap but the food is AMAZING for the price its at."}
{"text":"After u get pass the smell you'll love the food and their big portions. Will definitely be going back to this place. Awesome fried rice and katsu"}
{"text":"Chicken katsu was delicious, very crispy, very fresh. Macaroni salad was On point and fresh. Very delicious! We will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Prices are great for quick chinese food.  If you're used to Panda...go to Panda.  Here, you've got a real chinese man cooking in the back not a Mexican.  It's not fancy...but I don't need fancy when I just want Chinese food.  Fortunately, I know how to select good food choices and not have to opt for ordering teriyaki chicken in a Chinese joint.  4 stars for cheap prices, quick food, generous portions and tasty enough to satisfy my hunger...after a long day."}
{"text":"I was hungry and now I'm not ... Yum
Loved the Hawaiian menu
I had the BBQ Mix Combo ... Super Good the beef short ribs
My kid had the Manapau she love it then eat all my fries :-)"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this lately, you gotta go again. Changed hands and now does Hawaiian and Chinese. Food is much better than before....everything we have tried was excellent (especially the Hawaiian BBQ chicken)  Add good prices to great food,  and  make it a definite recommendation for us"}
{"text":"I originally reviewed this restaurant under different ownership and they were a Chinese menu primarily. Under the new owners and Hawaiian menu, they've gotten even BETTER! The beef teriyaki bowl is spectacular. The chicken katsu is amazing and picky kid friendly. If you live in the area, or if you don't but just want to support good local businesses,  don't hesitate to try Gourmet Wok!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be just Chinese food-new owners serving Hawaiian and Chinese food.  The style, more like Hawaiian-Chinese-tasty and affordable"}
{"text":"Fried rice was pretty good and you get your money's worth for $6.

Everything else was not that great. I was hoping that what they saved on decor would be put into quality food but I was a little disappointed.

General's Chicken was not very fresh, it was pretty much the same as what you would get at Panda Express.

I think I'll try the boba tea and a different entr√©e next time, hopefully there is something better on the menu."}
{"text":"It's getting harder and harder to find cheap eats, but you can practically have a three-course meal for two under $20 here! A true mom-and-pop style spot with both Hawaiian and Chinese dishes- it's rare to find anything over $10 here, and if you do, it's more than one meal's worth of food.

The garlic chicken and garlic shrimp are my go-tos, either as a plate (with rice and mac) or bowl (rice and veg), sometimes I'll add on a spam musubi. The lemon chicken is just okay, and I found the saimin super greasy. I hear great things about the malasadas but haven't yet tried them.

The ambiance may be nonexistent, but it's a solid emergency lunch spot- any time I call, they can have an order ready in 10 minutes or less, and $10 or under. Service is polite but very quiet. Double check your bag for napkins, utensils, and condiments before you go."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Katsu plate with a Thai ice tea. The Katsu Chicken was dark meat it was okay.. You can taste the chicken grease like its old. The white rice that came with it had a flower aroma (not my thing) Mac salad was good. Thai ice wasn't sweet enough and to much cream. The lady in the front was very nice and so was the man in the back so 3 stars for customer service. Maybe I'll be back to try something on the grill rather then the fryer."}
{"text":"We ordered from here on Friday night and it ended up being a very unsatisfying experience for the most part. The sweet and sour chicken is the only thing that tasted good. The General Tso's chicken tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce on it, the egg rolls were mushy and the other 2 entrees we has we're flat out disappointing. We decided to try it because its a little bit closer to us then China One but from now on I will go back to China One. Same price there but far better food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend bought the following:

Shrimp Fried Rice
Sweet/Sour Chicken
Chicken Chow Mein
Kung Pao Chicken

The dinner was very poorly cooked.  The sweet and sour chicken was very dry.  The fried rice had undercooked blocked carrots.  The kung pao wasnt spicy at all.  The noodles were the only thing that tasted fresh.  I was very dissappointed with this meal, as I have had better Chinese take out.  Possibly a bad night for this restaurant."}
{"text":"\"When will my food be ready for pick-up?\"

\"When would you like it?\"

That's the FIRST thing that comes to mind when I think about my review for Gourmet Wok.  I found this place through some searching around my immediate work area and, being the diligent Yelper I am, wanted to try something new.

I haven't been so excited to try a new place in awhile!  I get excited when I find diamonds in the rough, and I think that's a fair assessment of this place.

Their prices are great and it's insanely fast.  I ordered, drove over there (~4 minutes) and my food was already bagged and ready for me.

I've tried the veggie egg foo yung and kung pao chicken here.  They are both different styles than what I'm used to, but good nonetheless.  Portions are a good size, and $4.25 for a lunch special?  Come on, bro - why even bother with McDonald's?  Cheap, fast, healthy.  Sold.

The lady at the counter is always really nice too.  One time I called in and she asked for my name and she laughed and said, \"You have a very expensive name.\"

ALSO: They have boba tea!  Yay!  Close boba tea!  Not great for my low-sugar diet, but that's ok.  =)"}
{"text":"Gourmet wok? More like less than mediocre wok.. It's alright but not worth the time. Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This place is just down the street from me. However, I never gave it a try until yesterday. I'm glad I finally stopped in. I got the lunch special with cashew chicken, fried rice and an egg roll for $4.25. You heard right...$4.25!!! And it was cooked to order, very tasty, and filling. I will definitely be back. I just wish I had tried it sooner. They have a large selection of dishes, and I'm looking forward to sampling more of the menu."}
{"text":"Simple menu and pretty good food.  Well at least what I ordered.  Got the Mongolian Beef, Lemon Chicken Bowl and the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken (mini).  Mongolian beef was a HUGE order and pretty spicy, but was good.  The Lemon Chicken Bowl wasn't the best.  They give you the sauce on the side, which I prefer, but wasn't the best on the taste buds.  It reminded me of that drink Tang, lol.  But the actual chicken was good and crispy.  And the Hawaiian Chicken Bowl was Y U M !  Great flavor, wasn't over cooked and the mac salad was on point.  Will be back to try more items.  Until next time..."}
{"text":"I recently tried this place out of a spur-of-the-moment type of occasion and it was a great choice! The noodles were one of the best i have ever tasted. And don't even get me started on the rice. Omg. Super good. I got the lunch menu which is a really good deal, everything is so yummy. Good place to go to any time of day"}
{"text":"New management....food is delish for Chinese fast food!  Reasonably priced...great quantity!  They deliver!  Miss the old guy...but these people are putting out delicious food.  So far, had sesame chicken, Hong Kong pan fried noodles and chow fun with beef.  All dishes were fab!"}
{"text":"Lunch is very delicious and for cheap. BUT... The customer service is horrible, seriously horrible. Its always the asian lady and the man cook working, probably a husband & wife owned. If it wasnt for the cook being so welcoming and cooks well, I would never ever come back to this place. The lady up front is not only rude but very very lazy. You come in, you have to greet her yourself, you then get your own menus and seat yourself. When you are ready to order, you walk to her and let her know what you want. Thats when you also ask for your utensils and a cup for your canned soda. You then eat with flies swarming around you due to her leaving the door open because they dont have air on. I give the cook 2 stars for the efforts and his smile. But I think after this experience, I am so done with this place. Too bad, it was walking distance from my work."}
{"text":"Hmmm didn't realize I haven't acknowledged this place. 3.5*** for food, flavor and variety. Half star for very nice people working here, but also very timid. It's okay they'll get used to interaction.

I like their food and they're so close to home. Looks like we've tried a few things so far. Today's chicken BBQ lunch plate prompted me to tell about them. Good variety in their menu. Of course I haven't tried everything. But my regards to what I have thus far.

They have malasadas here! I recall some of my Hawaiian friends craving that stuff. It's served hot and delicious, full of sweet tooth amore. I'm soooooo glad they serve saimin noodles. I gotta thing for comfy soup. They're gonna help me out with that on those days I'm needy. I don't believe in cheat days guys. But FYI spam and eggs with rice is found here too! Spam is such a childhood icon for me. And lastly, very moist BBQ chicken with just right sweetness and not overly charred.

You betcha ima order again from here. Got my thoughts on those malasadas for you rosebuds! 
Aloha oe!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty cheap Chinese food. It's nothing fancy, just an order at the county place with cheap tables and chairs in case you want to eat in. Mostly a takeout place. 
Lunch specials are just under $5 bucks, and they're pretty good. You get an eggroll, that actually tastes fresh, instead of that premade stuff everyone serves, a big pile of fried rice, and your entree. Portions are huge, like at some places, but it's certainly filling, and for the price, you just can't beat it. 
It's not the BEST chinese food in the world, but if you're on a budget this place is awesome. 
Any place that has boba tea gets an extra star from me. :)"}
{"text":"Over the past five years I have eaten at Gourmet Wok 15-20 times. I have eaten in and carried out. The food (especially the Lunch Special) is a good value and consistently tastes good to me. Not fancy...just a  nice, hearty meal. The serving size is ample and the workers are friendly."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Not the worst Chinese food I've had. I ordered a dinner combo with orange chicken and curry chicken. It came with fried rice and an egg roll, you can get steamed rice if you prefer, and I ordered an egg flower soup. 

Orange chicken was not very flavorful. But it was cooked well. Curry chicken was alright but the chicken seemed fatty.

Fried rice was good.

Egg flower soup was decent other than they had mushrooms in it. I'm not a fan of mushrooms and they look like slugs in the soup. They give you a big portion of soup though when it comes in the to go container. 

Service wasn't bad, but I've had better. Price was around $12 for what I ordered."}
{"text":"... okay. This place makes me wish panda delivered.
We dont eat shrimp. I made sure i told the lady this, so i asked for more fried wontons then shrimp puffs.
Fried wonton = chips. 
Fried rice i asked for chicken, they gave us combination WHICH HAS SHRIMP. ... glad I'm not alergic.
I posted pictures of our order. 
Ill never ordered here again. Not worth $28 for family of 2.
Left overs will make it to the trash for 1st time ever.
Flavorless garlic beef and chicken with broccoli was boring too.
However!!!!! EGG DROP SOUP AND EGGROLLS WERE NOT BAD.
fast delivery too. Sorta sucks, was really wanting Chinese"}
{"text":"Two words, SHRIMP SHIT!  They do not devien their shrimp or at least that night they didn't, which means I will never eat here again.  I love shrimp fried rice and decided to place an order to go since they are right down the street from my house.  I was so disappointed too see the shrimp had not been devien.  This may not be a problem for some but a deal breaker for me.  If they don't clean the shrimp what else don't they clean??  The chicken chow mein was pretty good, I would give 2 stars if only they told me pork was in the egg rolls.  I guess that was my fault for assuming they were vegetable.  I wouldn't have mind chicken egg rolls but pork, uh no.  I wish the person taking the order would have said something.  My son couldn't have his favorite dish either."}
{"text":"Pretty dam good!! Just moved in around the corner and read some good reviews... I have to say it was a great feeling to know I now have a good Chinese place nearby!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow.  I've always been pretty disappointed with chinese food in this town, but this place really came through.  Good food, good deals, and super fast.  I placed my order, and exactly 20 minutes later they were at my door.  We got orange chicken, general's chicken, beef pepper steak and pork lo mein, and all of the dishes were delicious.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and had the special chicken chow mein for 4.25$ was totally yummy! Still not a fan of their egg rolls but the rice was a lot better this time! Super cheap and quick!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The new owners have made the food here scrumptious. We tried the soup (plain- to begin with), mix plate (with garlic chicken- had to try) and orange chicken, and a mini BBQ ribs. All were very good. Tasted fresh. We will definitely be going back. Grub Hub delivers from here if you need delivery for now. I'll take pics next time. Oops. Lol"}
{"text":"I was in the area and craving Chinese. Sadly, in LV, the best I've found is Panda. But, occasionally, I get my hopes up for that little amazing hole in the wall.

This was not that place.

My husband and I ordered chicken fried rice, chicken wings, garlic chicken, beef and broccoli, and spicy pepper pork chops. I think each item was about $5. We just drove up and placed a take out order. The staff was nice. Everything seemed made to order. And, it was ready in about 10 minutes or so.

The positives pretty much end there.

Chicken wings were OK. Usually places deep fry the wings. This place coats them in a batter and then deep fries them. The batter didn't really add anything and I would have preferred them without. The fried rice was OK, except for the occasional piece of cartilage. My husband liked the spicy pork thing he ordered and the garlic chicken was really good, but not really garlicky. And, the beef and broccoli was just...gross. It kinda turned my stomach to where I couldn't really eat the other items. Neither one of us could even look at it. I didn't try it. It went directly into the trash.

I love trying new places. And, I always root for mom and pop establishments. But, I don't know how this place stays in business. It was overall, a bad experience, and I wish so badly I had just stuck with Panda!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was very young. This place has been here for over 20 years and it's as good now as it was then. Very consistent. Combo fried rice is excellent. It's my go to Chinese place and I would recommend it to anyone reading this."}
{"text":"Since it's right down the road I thought I'd try.  I was told there's no delivery before 7:30 PM.  I don't know if that's every day or if their delivery person just wasn't in at the time.

Bottom line, the prices are average, the food very far below average.  The family combos are the best deal. The dinner combo for 2 at $22.95 was enough for 3, maybe 4 if one person doesn't try all of the items.

We tried:
- Egg rolls
- fried wonton
- shrimp puff
- egg flower soup
- combination fried rice
- orange chicken
- teriyaki chicken

The egg rolls were just ok... too greasy and the filling was a bit on the mushy side, not enough textural contrast since the wrapper wasn't as crispy as I'd like.

Fried wontons are insignificant filler

Shrimp puff was surprisingly good, though over-fried.  I wasn't expecting the filling to be curry, but it was pleasant.  If they could fry it less so it's not so painful to eat that would be my favorite appetizer.

The egg flower soup was your standard egg drop soup, too gelatinous for my taste.  I added some chicken stock and it was better

The combination fried rice was our favorite.  It's very well seasoned and has a pleasant texture.  I have to say it's the best fried rice I've had in this town yet.

The orange chicken was overcooked, dry and the sauce was too mild.

The chicken teriyaki was almost good... but the chicken was too dry.  Extremely dry.  The sauce was tasty but gelatinous.  It was served on a bed of broccoli which I wasn't expecting, and oddly enough was the best part of the meal!  It was steamed well but had enough bite to not be mushy and tasted fantastic with the teriyaki sauce.

Overall, very poorly executed food.  The sauces that could have saved the meal instead added nothing to it, and what they do to chicken is criminal.

If I ever order from here again it will be the fried rice."}
{"text":"Very reasonably price for great quality food. Love their shrimp fried rice with bean sprouts."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Super fast service. Food was made writhing 10 minutes. First time trying out this place and definitely not the last."}
{"text":"cheap chinese food here, large portions, there dumplings here are very good. 10 for like 5$ or something. good deal. There chicken cashew was okay, F/R is good. everything else was good, but nothing else stuck out that amazed me. There sesame chicken was edible and taste good, but they could do better."}
