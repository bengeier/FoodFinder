{"text":"Three stars means I like it! They gave me a free sample of tikka chicken, which was very nice and moist, but I chose the Tandoori chicken plate. It comes with choice of rice or bread and I picked the Tandoori bread - wonderful, hot and crusty. It also come with choice of salad or vegetables. They have vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"I don't understand why there aren't more reviews on this excellent Indian fast-food. I came across this place by accident and decided to try it out ,being a fan of Indian food.

Even though the mall (Les Faubourgs) looks sketchy, don't be fooled, this might be the best quality food you can have for the price you will pay. We ordered two full plates that included salads, rice and potatoes, one plate was a mix of vegetarian curries and the other one was butter chicken, one Naan bread ( for us it was made right on the spot in an authentic Tandoor oven), and one samosa. The total was of 20$. I was very skeptical but once I had my first bite, I knew I had to come back for more. 

The food wasn't too spicy but you had the choice to add very spicy sauce if you are a fan of hot food. The food and sauces were fresh and the Naan is hands down the best I have ever had (no kidding).

In conclusion, if you are looking for fast Indian food for a good price, you need to try this out."}
{"text":"This might sound like sacrilege, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Poulet Tikka is an even better lunch option than the incredible Thai food at Bangkok Kitchen on the other side of the Faubourg's weird but wonderful food court. Naan kebabs and seekh kebab plate are particularly good. No matter what you order, everything comes with a varied and healthy assortment of toppings and sides -- you are guaranteed a good ladleful of legumes, usually either red kidney beans or chickpeas, as well as a variety of cabbage salads, garlic or mint sauce, and other shredded vegetables. Everything is fresh, and glistens with tasty dressings and sauces. This is a rare quick-eats spot where carnivores and vegetarians will feel equally fulfilled. 

My first visit here was after Sarah Musgrave profiled the naan kebab in her \"Sandwich Club\" series in the Gazette. That was a few years ago, and they still belong in the select circle of Montreal lunch greats."}
{"text":"A food court kind of restaurant. It has so many choices to offer. I had a daily special- chicken masala. With rice, salad, a kebab and a lentil soup. They are tasty and come with big portion with a good price. Very good price for the students around. 
They have mango lassi which is not a thick texture, considering the price it is good. 
The chicken dishes look all attractive to me. Next time I would like to try a butter chicken. 
The waiter was nice and friendly as well as the owner. 
Try the sauce they offer above the counter. They are full of spices."}
{"text":"A secret. A hidden little gem in an upstairs shopping mall food court - of absolutely delicious Indian food. All of it, including sauces, made by the chef owner. He's got that glint in his eye of someone who likes to cook and he is talented - great combination!

\"Do you have Lassi?\" I asked, not seeing it on the menu. (This is a lightly sweetened yogurt drink.)

\"Well...I'll make you some.\" ...and off he went, coming back in a few minutes with THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD!! Just, ab so lute ly perfect. I couldn't believe it. I almost cried.

At that point I had to try more than what I had ordered - getting a little bit of Tandoori chicken, various sauces, spinach, curry, -- all of it, all of it really, really good.

My only complaint was the Naan. It was tasty, but not made fresh, made in advance and re-heated. But come on, this is a shopping mall Indian food place. The other flavors more than made up for it and I did visit at about 3:00 when they were cleaning up from lunch.

In any case, I am coming back with an appetite, they had some lamb that looked delicious."}
