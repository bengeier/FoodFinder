{"text":"Food is good and the prices are very reasonable, but parking is a nightmare. There are too many unmarked but apparently reserved spots at this establishment."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for 25% off, so I decided to go for the Meatball sub.
The meat balls are so tender and covered in a delicious sauce, and the bread is very firm, and the perfect size to fit right in your hand.

I have also tried the Chef's coq au vin, which is some of the best I have ever had.

My only issue with this place was the drink selection. There was only Kirkland Signature water. I would have preferred something a bit more up market, like a Vos."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in town,  but it's one of those secret places where you have to know someone otherwise they turn you away.  Invitation only and highly exclusive."}
{"text":"This place has everything a hipster foodie could want.

Bizarre location 
Invite only exclusivity 
Craft beer 
Eccentric chef 
Surprise menu 

It's a little unnerving that Chef Jared insists on spoon feeding you, but the quality of the food makes it worthwhile. The other kitchen staff can best be described as salty. Remember to clean up your dishes or you'll find out just how salty they can be. 

If you can get an invite, do not pass up the opportunity to dine here."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent!  Can't go wrong with \"Chef Jared\" and his breakfast or lunch specials

{"text":"Excellent food made by chef Jared. His oatmeal waffles with banana foster topping and whip cream is AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Chef Jared makes the most exquisite food. I once saw him teaching some young folk how to bake bread. It's great to see slickmeals give back to the community as well as serve great food."}
{"text":"The daily special can vary from meatball subs to chicken a la Jared in a white wine reduction.  Typically there is only one option to choose from so you are at the mercy of the chef, but the food is superb.  Highly recommend!"}
