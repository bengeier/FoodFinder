{"text":"This place had changed owners and their food is much better than it used to be. 

The lamb leg is a must try!!! You wouldn't believe the quality of the meat that you can find food court these days. 

Definitely a revisit"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick bite during a day of shopping at STC. Not wanting too heavy a lunch, we opted to share a 'Persian Kebab' between us. According to the picture, it appeared to be Vaziri... one koobideh and one chicken breast. With rice and a side of chickpea salad, it was plenty enough food for the two of us.

I have to admit, I was a tad disappointed with the kebabs. The chicken had a texture that left me wondering if it was ground chicken formed into a kebab and the koobideh... seriously,  even I can make better koobideh than that and I'm as Canadian as they come!

The rice and chickpea salad were the saving graces of this dish as both were quite flavourful.

Would I eat here again? Possibly. I can't honestly expect true Persian cuisine from a food court and it was a little pricey for what we got but they seemed to have a good selection so I'd definitely try other dishes.

2 stars for the kebabs but a 3 star for finding 'Persian' cuisine in a food court."}
{"text":"Such good food, nice servers that aren't stingy. Also added healthier sides like grilled okra and grilled beans."}
{"text":"Came here after a day of shopping at Scarborough a Town Centre. Saw that the food was halal which was plus for me! Ordered the beef Persian kabobs which came with basmati rice and 2 sides. I decided to go with the cucumber salad and steamed broccoli. The portion size was a good amount and reasonable for the price. The kabobs were perfectly cooked however pretty bland and lacking salt. The sides and rice were good but the main part of the meal which was the meat was not appetizing."}
{"text":"good choice for food court
The chicken drum stick is overly grilled and turned black 
Mashed potato is good
Cooked veggie reminds me of the food I had back in high school"}
{"text":"Scarborough Town Centre is full of these small restaurants that sell the exact same food, right next eachother. The food was average, ordered the chicken and rice."}
