{"text":"I will definitely not be going back to this restaurant. The food was horrible, not cooked properly and missing side dishes. Service was horrible. 

Customers are asked to pay up front. After paying we waited 10 minutes and the server comes out and says \"sorry we don't have this and that\", even though its on the menu. Food was under cooked. One order also had a fruit cup. When asked for the fruit cup the server said they don't have it and asked if they wanted tomatoes instead. 

Please save your money for something better."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant today with my boyfriend - only because Coras was packed. I ordered the chicken sausage with eggs and he ordered the turkey sausage with eggs. The staff were not rude, however, the service was terrible. Their table seating was unorganized and they had no idea which food belonged to the customers who had been seated. The ordering system definitely causes confusion. It would be reasonable if it happened once, but, it happened every time an order was ready. The food quality was average but definitely needs to be cooked thoroughly. The location and facility is really nice. Overall, I wouldn't go back because the atmosphere made is uncomfortable. If there are major changes made such as proper ordering system and food being cooked throughly then I would definitely give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I know this placed is moved but I want to review it here as I eat here before they moved over. The place was great, the service was quick and amazing.

You go up to the cashier and order there. I had an omelette and my wife had scrambled eggs both came with potatoes and toast. The food was good, you might say how can someone screw up breakfast... trust me! you would be surprised. But these guys did a good job!"}
{"text":"I visited this place on Sunday very nice environment i did not eat there i bought breakfast for takeout. I must say that the prices were very reasonable. The portions was very good and it tastes good."}
{"text":"I love this place, I really do. 

it's one of those hidden cheap big meal type of places. You can get almost anything and it's all under ten dollars and you're going to be so full. 

All day breakfast which is amazing, I've never ordered something I didn't like. 

But you have to keep in mind you're not going to a fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"Speed breakfast.  It's breakfast and you can't go wrong.  Free refills on coffee and tea."}
{"text":"I am always trying to find new places to eat breakfast in Brampton. I ordered the pancakes with  a side order of eggs. Food came out very quick and the price was reasonable. The menu isnt over complicated compared to other breakfast places. Although the homefries reminded me alot of Giggling Tomatoes (loved them either way),  the pancakes were very fluffy and fresh, and the eggs were whole eggs. I am definitely coming back to try more off of their lunch and dinner menus."}
{"text":"This place is terrible .. Terrible service .. Lady at the front was extremely rude and didn't want to be there at all.  My food came 5 minutes after the three people behind me.  We all ordered the same thing.  Lady didn't even give me a number.  They brought me 2 different meals that weren't mine.  Finally they got it right.  I ordered 3 eggs, bacon and sausage special ... Eggs were sunny side up .. One of the eggs was broken and fully cooked and tasted disgusting while the other 2 were perfectly sunny side up.  The lady even noticed it and didn't care.  Place was so dirty and the vibe was not good in here at all.  My second time here and will not return.  Giggling tomatoes is way better, friendlier staff, cleaner place and people are respectful.  Even Denny's is better.  Would never recommend this place to anyone. Gave 1 star because can't give anything less."}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend for brunch because of the good reviews I read on yelp. I ordered the Greek omelet and the boyfriend had the Texas omelet; both came with home fries and toast. I loved how the omelettes had a good amount of filling!! The food was good but pretty standard (it's kind of hard to mess up an omelet!). The only complaint was that my boyfriend wished they served waffles (we usually go to Cora's). The price was good ($9 each). I probably would come here again."}
{"text":"Cheap and cheerful! As Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear would say. This is a no frills throwback Greek breakfast joint that offers a massive menu with dishes that are under $10 dollars. The breakfast is fast and consistently good and plentiful, but don't venture too far as some of the dishes are misses.

The burger however is my favorite in all of Brampton."}
{"text":"Forget these new establishments that charge you 20 bucks for a burger and fries, when you can have the BEST burger with fries for $5.99.  This place is known as a great and affordable breakfast place that doesn't break the bank, an entire family of four can eat here for $30 bucks for good quality food."}
{"text":"Good eggs. I guess they do have good eggs because it's pretty hard to mess up eggs! I got the breakfast special with 3 eggs 2 sausages 2 pieces of bacon hash browns and toast. Great breakfast for after a good prior night out. You order at a counter and they give u a number and bring your food. Grab your own utensils and the condiments are at the table. They have a coffee station. Half caf√© style I guess. There are tv's playing the news throughout the eating wares. Lots of booths. The food came quickly. I did not like the sausage because it was salty and oily but that's just my preference for no salt. The eggs come to order. Overall the quality was good. Could have done without the sausage and get more hashbrowns - did they count the amount served? Can't complain as it was only $6.99 for brunch. Definitely very casual and good hangover spot ! I wish the cutlery was wrapped up though :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place after reading a few reviews. I will say I was not impressed with the breakfast.  I have added a picture. They do have other items on their menu as well.  I would not return for breakfast. For 3 eggs bacon and what they call home fries I paid almost $7.  I think.  I  would prefer to go to my favorite place  which is off steeles they are far more reasonably priced and have great portion size. This is not the place for me for breakfast."}
{"text":"So we went here for a late breakfast.. Had my son hubby my sister brother in law and my baby girl.. we all got the breakfast special 3 eggs 2 bacon 2 sausage and 2 pancake or French toast for $8.99 for my son we got him the same minus the pancake which was $6.99.. I'm not sure how long this breakfast place has been here but the location is pretty hidden i only saw it cause we went to service Ontario couple of months ago.. it's like GIGGLING TOMATO but smaller.. 

Food wise it was ok.. I would honestly go else where just because they don't have consistency in the food on pancake was big and other is small and one was over cook and the other was mushy.. majority of our bacon was over cooked.. we like some crisp to the bacon but not to the point where you can make it too bacon powder.. serving size was a bit small but I guess you get what you paid..

The only reason I have this 4 stars was because of one of the gentleman that works there.. he was an elderly man and you could see him going constantly back and forth making sure the place is clean.. he was working so hard that my sister and I felt sad because for us we won't want to see any elderly person working so hard esp it's a family breakfast place and kids do make a mess.. so we tried to help him as much as we can do he won't do all the work of our mess.. the elderly man is the one who deserves a big tip.. and he was very friendly putting on a smile when you can see he is so tired.."}
{"text":"This place suffers from having way too large of a menu. There's like a hundred menu items ranging from pastas to burgers to gyros to French toast. They even sell clam strips (???). Each item is numbered on the wall menu, so the effect is even more amplified when you find yourself at the counter asking for dish #97. If they'd focus on maybe 10-20 items max, I think it would bode well for business. 

Maybe I'm salty about their huge menu cause I made the mistake of ordering a item they didn't specialize in on my first visit there? Maybe. Overwhelmed by the options, I ended up ordering a gyros wrap. In my defense, it was on their specials menu! Terrible mistake. They didn't even have a spit! I ended up with a sad slab of mystery meat in a sad pita with a sad looking white garlicky sauce. Never again.

This time, however, I was told to stick to their breakfast menu. I ordered their breakfast combo which had 3 eggs, 2 sausages, 2 bacon strips, 2 slices of French toast, and home fries. Talk about a big breakfast! This was actually well worth my money. They do breakfast right!

So... If you're here. Don't get frightened by all the options. ONLY consider the right side of the menu. It's their all-day breakfast. They're good at it. Thank me later."}
{"text":"So I went back and got some breakfast. 

This time, I ordered the turkey bacon breakfast. It came with turkey bacon, eggs, home fries, and toast. Pretty standard.

The turkey bacon was quite tasty, cooked well and not too oily. The home fries were decently seasoned, but I've had much better. Toast was sub par, a little burnt and dry. Eggs were cooked as requested, no complaints there.

I'd recommend to stick with the breakfast... It was much better than the gyros I had on my last visit.

Ps. While you're waiting, scan the menu and see how many spelling errors you can spot! I found at least 10. I think for my next visit, I'll get the mashroom omelett with pennea and some chicken brest on the side. For my drink, I'll have fresh squeez orange juice."}
{"text":"Went here for bunch with the babe yesterday and I really enjoyed it!

It was a very no frills, not fancy breakfast but it truly hit the spot! Super cheap prices and all day breakfast, what else could you want?

I like that they offer freshly squeezed OJ and hazelnut coffee as well (it's the little things!).

Also, it is an order and pay first then find a seat type of place ;) Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Good place if you're looking for cheap breakfast/hearty food. The giggling tomatoes near us started to go downhill so we ended up trying this place and I was pleasantly surprised. This is now the main place I come for cheap and good breakfast foods. The place is nice, always clean, and service is usually quick even if it's busy. I had an issue once but that was only one of many many times I have eaten here."}
{"text":"Great prices, awesome service, and delicious food. 
I was happy to find a spot somewhat close to the airport and decided to check it out. We got french toast with potatoes and 3 eggs with sausage plates. Also decided to order freshly squeezed orange juice. The food was absolutely delicious and fresh. Would definitely come back again and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new so the inside is relatively clean. They offer free wifi which is great if you want to check email or read news.

I go in the mornings so the wait for food has never been long, very quick actually.

Price is alright. I usually get the Texas omelet which comes out to about $10 and comes with taters, not including coffee. The omelet is tasty and has a lot of ingredients inside so it is worth it. I would give it a try if you are nearby and bored of Tim Horton's and MacDonalds which are just across the street too."}
{"text":"Craving a great breakfast or meal but you don't want to break the bank?  Good Egg can take care of that!!  I came here on a recommendation and I am glad I did.  Good Egg Diner recently moved from an old Wendys location to a brand new building on the corner of Airport and Queen. 

A little different set up than an usual restaurant.  You order at the front counter from a varied menu ranging from breakfast items to pasta dishes to burgers.  If you craving something..but you don't know what to eat...Good Egg probably has something for you.  After you order you grab a seat at one of the tables and they will bring the food out to you.  Basically, there are no servers..grab your own drinks and refills.  

On my visit, I ordered the \"Texas\" omelette (sausage, green peppers, onions, cheese) and home fries with toast.  The wife ordered a BLT with fries and gravy.  I grabbed a coffee from the self serve station (Brazilian Coffee company...mmm) and we sat down.  The food arrived quickly and it was great!  Good Egg Diner provides no nonsense dining with great pricing and good food!!"}
{"text":"This little dinner is a hidden gem in Brampton. Service is wonderful and the restaurant is clean. They have a wide variety of options on their menu. My favorite is the pork souvlaki on a pita. It's usually my breakfast go-to. My family and I are typically here at least once for the month. On special days; Mother's Day and Father's Day-they are busier and may have a little wait time. Decor is simple and there is a mix of booths and tables available for dine-in.  Take-out or call ahead orders is all also available.  Its worth checking out next time you're in the area and can't decide on a food joint. And free refills on coffee.  (They also carry a decanter of hazelnut coffee. Yum!)"}
{"text":"My family and I are obsessed with Good Egg Dining. It is in the building where the old Wendy's used to be. It has EVERYTHING you could want and the prices are fantastic.
My dad loves the liver and onions, I love the pasta, my mom and sister have different things every time we go here.
You get a jug of water you can just take to the table yourself.
The pasta is about $7-9 and very tasty.
It is still open even though the whole plaza is undergoing renovations.
This plaza seems to be cursed, I really hope Good Egg Dining lasts because I'd miss it if it was gone."}
{"text":"This was our second time eating here and we weren't disappointed. Good simple breakfast with food that is good, hearty and tasty. Quality was consistent on both occasions. Order at cash, serve-yourself coffee, condiments and cutlery, and table service with your order. Friendly staff. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch place. Very good prices if you know what to take ;)"}
{"text":"Early morning I was in Brampton and found Good Egg Dining through Yelp. Though it doesn't have many reviews, the quality of the reviews is what helped me decide on visiting. Never underestimate the power of a good review!

Upon entering, we were greeted by a server at the cash register. She explained that you order at the register and seat yourselves afterwards while they make and bring you your food. They had a huge menu with a variety of options and I was pleased to find chicken and turkey sausage on the menu. I opted for the chicken sausage with 3 eggs, toast, and home fries for 7.99. I also got a coffee (1.79) where you could get endless refills. 

After finding a seat in the booth, the food came quickly and was a good value for the price you pay. The chicken sausage was a bit too dry for me but otherwise, I was very satisfied with the meal. 

Overall, I think I've found a new hidden gem for my weekends in Brampton. I'll definitely be back for breakfast and will be trying the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you win.  Sometimes you lose.  It depends on when you walk into a place and they can be spot on or just off all the way.

I was heading into a biz meeting and wanted to get some food.  Skipped breakfast so I decided it would be GOOD to get some EGG for DINING (see what I did there. :)

The place had a smattering of posters of their food and specials.  One said breakfast starts at $3.99 and I know I'm not going to order that but nonetheless, it's a darn good price for a non-McD type breakfast!  FYI - nothing on the menu was $3.99.

A young 20 something girl told me that I need to order first before sitting down.  Really?  OK...ordered a big breakfast platter and a cup of coffee.  She handed me a cup and a number...Er...Ok.  She also handed me a machine to pre-pay for my meal and TIP was expected...Er...Ok.

The opening to the kitchen split the order taking area to the right of it and the self serve coffee and cutlery station to the left.  Er...not going to serve me?  WTF?

Coffee was weak and they also had pump carafe for flavoured coffee - ew.  Anyway, napkins, fork, knife, and coffee, + order number in hand, I sat down.

Food came out shortly - at least I didn't have to pick that up too.  Server did nothing but stand at the cash and not even move around to fill up a cup of coffee.  Had to get up and walk over and refill my tiny cup once again.

OK...let's get some work done before my meeting.  WiFi - guest network not working.  Ask the server - she said for me to \"forget the network\" option and redo - duh!?!  Like I didn't do that already.  She shrugs and walks away....Er...Really?  WTF???  I was kind of fuming at this point.

Another customer walks in and asks about some menu items and she says \"no\" and then he asks another question and then she says \"no...uhm...maybe.\"  Cook/owner comes out and says \"of course we can.\"  Customer says to the server - \"If you F#k1ng don't know, don't say NO...I've had it.  This is over. Never coming here ever again.\"  Kind of said it for me.  At least he didn't pay upfront and tipped out like I did.  AND no wonder they take your money upfront.  If they didn't no one would pay or tip at all!  I'm so DUH!

Anyone that personally knows me, knows that I am pretty easy going but this experience tramples on all my expectations.  Really disappointed and yes...Never coming here ever again.  The server single-handedly lost two customers in less than an hour.  Er...Yes..Really....

Jeers!"}
