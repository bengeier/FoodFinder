{"text":"The food here was amazing!  What better way to get the gastric juices flowing than with a pretty as a picture presentation.  We did the Prix Fix menu and started with the Beet Borsht, which was creamy, thick, hot and so tasty. A bit different from the chunky borsht but the flavours were beautifully married and the creme fraiche set off the beautiful red colour.  Our main was the Yellow tail Tuna, which was perfectly seared only and rare in the middle, but served on top of a wasabi and pea base puree that had just the right amount of heat.  This dish was outstanding and worth a trip from anywhere. Our dessert was Crème Brule, it was perfect in taste, consistency and not too large. The only negative was the service was a bit slow, but she was the only server for a 3/4 full restaurant and did her best. The music was not too loud.  We walk out of restaurants that play music too loud as conversation then is impossible."}
{"text":"I had waited a couple of months before making my first reservation at Lardon and I'm glad I did.  At 6:00PM on a Saturday night, we arrived promptly at the newly renovated restaurant and was greeted by their hostess, Doris, who was warm and friendly.  My party of seven took the remaining reserved table available in this cozy, dimly-lit restaurant.  The decor was simple yet relaxingly sophisticated.  The main entrance was lined by large open windows and the kitchen, situated at the opposite end of the restaurant, offered a glimpse into the brainchild of this joint.  At the pass, stood chef/owner Jacky Lo, ready to command his troops with military precision.  Four members at my table were actually back on their 2nd/3rd visit and I was advised that everything on the menu was to be desired.  Our server was knowledgeable and helped us navigate through the plethora of Italian jargon and we all agreed to order to share.  We settled on the following from their new menu:  Cornish Hen x 2 Steak Frites Duck Confit Parmigiano Reggiano Rainbow Trout  Almost immediately after placing our order, we were surprised by some bread paired with a side trio of sun dried tomatoes, olives, and anchovies.  The table was torn as to which of the three complemented the toasted bread but we managed to clear the plates within minutes.  Personally, I enjoyed the anchovies the most as their saltiness just hit the spot.  Not normally an olive lover, I found the olives to be fruity and fragrant.  As the main course came out, the first thing I noticed was the clean presentation.  As for each dish:  Steak Frites - Done sous-vide style, I had never experienced a piece of beef that was done so perfectly a medium rare (as recommended by our server).  This is in agreement with Meagen B.'s review.  The only complaint that I had was that I was required to share this dish with 6 other people but that's of no fault to the restaurant.  Interestingly, the frites were actually my favourite part of this dish as the potatoes were thickly cut, crunchy on the outside, and soft and buttery on the inside!  Mmm, yum.  Cornish Hen - The hen arrived already de-boned with a crispy, golden brown skin and sitting on a bed of beluga lentil and carrots.  A bite into the hen revealed a hint of sweet alcohol which we later discovered was from the shiaoxing wine marinade.  Not necessarily my favourite dish but others seemed to really like it.  Duck Confit - Normally confined to dried pasta from a box, Lardon's fresh pasta was a first for me.  The duck was succulent but what sealed the deal for me was the sweet pieces of pear that accented the dish.  Nice!  Rainbow Trout - This was probably the star of the entrees and really the best bang for your buck.  The trout had an amazing smoky flavour that was infused deep within the fish, underneath the crispy skin.  I highly recommend this dish especially if you enjoy quinoa!  Unfortunately, I was sitting at the other end of the Parm-Reg so I can't comment on it.  Though, it looked on par with all of the other dishes.  Though full, the entire table shared one of each choice from the dessert menu which included:  Creme Brule - Thick custardy texture, maximum vanilla bean flavour, topped with a crackling sugar crust.  The best I've ever had.  Mango-Lemon Grass Sorbet & Berry-Basil Sorbet - The mango sorbet tasted like a perfectly ripe mango while revealing hints of earthy lemon-gress while the berry-basil was just to die for!  Top it all off with a fresh biscotti cookie.  Perfect.  Chocolate Mousse - Creamy chocolate mousse tower lined with a cookie crust matched with (if I remember correctly) a blueberry compote.  Bacon Maple Syrup Ice Cream - The name says it all.  You need to try this bold dessert on your next visit!  All in all, we enjoyed a laid back night at Lardon along with good service and a well executed meal.  I can't wait to go back and see what the chefs have to offer as the season/menu changes."}
{"text":"Yes, Yes, Yes!!!  This is the first decent meal we've had since we moved from San Francisco. I must also add this was take out since our toddler was going to bed.  We ordered the fois gras, scallops, butternut soup, and the duck confit.  STUNNING - all of it! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"For appetizers, we had the pear/walnut salad and lobster salad. The pear salad surprisingly came in a cute tower presentation (see attached photos) topped w/ blue cheese instead of the usual bowl of salad with stuff on top. The lobster/shrimp salad was put on top of a long slice of cucumber and topped w/ tobiko. Both tasted great...my favorite was the lobster salad for the textural differences.  For entrees, we had the beef bourguignon which was very rich tasting from braising with bacon and extremely tender. We also had the de-boned cornish game hen (the oldest entree on the menu) and the albacore tuna. The cornish game hen tasted great, but the standout was the very sweet roasted carrots. The tuna was very nicely presented on top of tasty root vegetables and quinoa (first time I've had quinoa and can't say I'm fond of the texture unfortunately); the wasabi pea puree tasted like a nice wasabi sauce rather than something made of wasabi peas...it worked well w/ the tuna.  The bacon/maple ice cream was two round balls of ice cream on top of what looked like graham cracker crumbs...the maple/bacon complemented each other but it was weird chewing on bits of bacon for a dessert :-) The creme brulee was surprisingly topped with a gooseberry which we don't get in Boston that much (only during the summer from local farmers markets).  Service was efficient and friendly. Would love to come again late summer when there are more local ingredients...we don't have nearly enough of these little bistro places with clever food presentations and textures in Boston :-P"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Amazing service and scrumptious dishes! I loved the risotto so much that yes, I would marry it!"}
{"text":"Dropped by Lardon on a whim last night after a patio beer on Roncy (note: patios are hard to find there) for some haute cuisine.   The space was what you'd expect to find in most white tablecloth joints, spread out tables, some abstract art on canvas, waitstaff in all black.   They had a 3 course fixed price menu of a salad or soup, any main on the menu and a creme brûlée for 25$, which is a pretty good deal since most of the mains are just over twenty boners. The app and dessert didn't really appeal to me so I ordered of the ontario rack of lamb with mashed potatoes, squash, and green beans.   While we were waiting for the food to arrive some warm bread was brought out with a brilliantly yellow pureed carrot and basil spread - which was delightful.   Then we waited forever for food.  I was a little surprised at the size of my main, a little on the small side compared with the other orders at the table and the lamb was a too fatty. It did taste very nice, though. The sides and jus were perfectly cooked and balanced the heaviness of the meat.  Had a sample of the creme brûlée (which took another 15-20ish minutes to bring out) which was as good as any creme brûlée you've probably had. Good but not good enough to wait for.  Overall, the quality of the food was totally satisfactory but our dining time was about 35 minutes too long. Saw only two guys in the kitchen and a lot of tables waiting alongside us. Quicken the pace and Lardon could be pretty good."}
{"text":"One of the best deals in the City has to be their weekday prix fixe menu. You get a three course meal for 25 bucks. It includes a choice of soup or salad to start, any main and then a choice between usually two different types of dessert. Since I live in the 'hood I have been coming here since it opened and have enjoyed every visit."}
{"text":"A delicious and fun dinner for two was enjoyed here. We ordered the prix fixe which included soup or salad, entree and dessert. The duck was very nicely prepared and the beet soup perfect for a chilly night. Both went very well with the Malbec.  The wine selection is limited if you only want a glass, however the choices by the glass are still good. Atmosphere is cozy and classy inside. Did not feel noise was an issue here. Great neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Au Pied de Cochon has a baby brother in Toronto - chef/owner Jacky Lo's Lardon Restaurant.  As a child, growing up in an immigrant family, we were always given the \"there are starving children in Africa \"sermon at the dinner table if we didn't clear our plates.  I guess Chef Lo's parents must have really hit home with that message as witnessed by his menu of pork belly, beef tripe, and foie gras.  He also believes in reducing waste and sourcing local ingredients.  Lardon is most popular as a flavour base in French cuisine and is simply small cubes of pork fat used to infuse food with flavour.  For those of you who are not big fans of pork, there are other options such as duck, Cornish hen, steak, trout, and lamb to choose from.  The wine list is regrettably short, especially if you want something by the glass.  We strolled in on a Friday night at 7PM to an empty restaurant, but things started picking up shortly after.  Our server was good, checking in on us at every course and was very good at ensuring our water glasses were full and recommended a great beer for my dining companion.  Even the non-beer-drinking gal (me) enjoyed the strong beer from Trois Pistoles.  The only complaint I have is that the wine glasses should've been removed (since neither of us were drinking wine) as the table started getting cluttered as the food arrived.  He eventually caught on and removed them.  Complimentary bread is served up with a side of carrot purée and sundried tomatoes.  This was a great departure from the usual butter or olive oil and balsamic duo. For starters I opted for the Pan Seared Foie Gras which is accompanied by crostinis, a duck rillette and berry compote.  The rillette was delicate and tender, unlike some of the dry, and pasty rillettes I've experienced in the past.  The berry compote was just the right level of sweetness and went well with the foie.  I found the foie to be a tad on the oily side, but it was definitely melt in your mouth good.   My dining companion opted for the Panko-crusted frog legs with basil pesto and red pepper coulis.  Although the frog legs were quite tender, the meat itself was bland which was not helped with a bland Panko crust.  The basil pesto was very toned down.  Overall, this was the most disappointing dish of the night for me.  For mains I had my heart set on the Roast Pork Belly served atop a bed of savoy cabbage, Yukon Gold mash and peas.  The most heavenly part of this dish was the crispy skin.  When I first saw it on the menu I was afraid that I would be experiencing yet another piece of pork belly that tasted like the stuff you get at the Chinese barbecue places, but I was not disappointed.  The jus flowed nicely into the mash, giving it a rich flavour.  The slight tartness and acidity from the savoy cabbage was also a nice touch.  The portion size was also quite generous, and I'm glad I had a dining companion to share with!    My dining companion's Lamb Shank was definitely the highlight of the night for me.  It just melted off the bone and soaked up every single drop of rich, jus flavour.  The meat was quite tender and it was also served atop a bed of delicate celery root mash.  It had a nice char to it, and the bits of charred fat just liquify in your mouth.   Yummy!  We managed to save a bit of room for dessert and ended up sharing the Maple-Bacon Ice Cream which was surrounded by a skirt of breadcrumbs and adorned with bacon bits.   The presentation was quite cute, and reminded me of a bunny rabbit.  I don't know that I would have it again as I don't think I am quite accustomed to having bacon bits in my repertoire of dessert ingredients.  Verdict:  Although the food was extremely rich, I didn't leave the restaurant feeling like I had ingested a fat-laden, calorie-exceeding meal.  I didn't feel disgustingly full.  The food at Lardon is carefully executed, and I caught glimpses from my seat of Chef Lo tasting all his dishes and readjusting the seasoning prior to plating.  The food comes out at a slow and steady pace, because Chef Lo will not send out anything that is mediocre.  The service is friendly, and the ambiance is cozy and intimate.  It is a place you can go to experience great food, and good conversation without having to worry about expensive parking, or scarcity in parking."}
{"text":"After psyching myself up by reading the menu, I found the food to be bland and boring. I had the mahi mahi and started with the arugula salad. Service was average but the wine menu was good. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Creative menu however dishes were slightly under seasoned. Bread course: Carrot spread had no flavor and didnt pair well with the sundried tomatoes. Bread was warm and delicious. Appetizer: seared scallops were cooked perfectly. However cauliflower purée and oyster mushrooms were not seasoned at all. Main: special of black cod....fish was cooked perfectly. Was a play on Nobu's miso glazed cod...but the intensity of the soy glaze took away from the buttery quality of the cod. Barley risotto had no flavour due to lack of seasoning. Lovely atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"Th, context: Friday night and plan had broke; so my husband and i decided to walk to roncy to grab a bite instead.  Lardon, small resto, not totally empty and not totally full that we would be turned away or asked to wait.  Atmosphere: 3/5, casual, not pretentious which I like  Value: Food is  very good value.  We got a free creme brulee with purchase of two mains. Drinks were a little over priced..  particular the beer and cocktails.  The food: But the pork belly was divine.  The shrimp croquettes was something we would not get again.... but that pork belly was another story- super crisp skin and tender buttery flavourful meat.  Makes total sense that the pork belly would be yummy..with a name like lardon... you almost expect it. Would I go back?  Probably"}
{"text":"Superb.  The four of us had a great evening--great service and great food.  Wednesday  night and we walked in with no reservation. No problem (although it was about 80% full).  Our server was friendly and personable throughout the evening.  Hubby had the $28 three course prie fixe--salad, main course and dessert.  The rest of us shared the lobster and the scallops first course.  The poached lobster and shrimp was great. generous portion for $12.  The scallops was stunning. Pan fried in bacon and perfectly cooked.  Our entrees were duck confit, pork belly, flat iron steak and Cornish hen.  They were all amazing.  hard to choose which was best.  For dessert we had an excellent creme brulee and the maple and bacon ice cream. (a bit too salty for my taste.)  A wonderful meal with great service."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've had in the city yet (been here for a year). From what I gather the chef is the owner and takes his food very seriously.   From Tuesday-Thursday, they offer a $25 fixed-price menu, that comes with a soup/salad, any main that costs under $25, and a dessert.   I had the soup (squash), pork-belly, and mango ice cream thing as part of my fixed-price menu and everything was exceptional. I was able to try the scallops and they were also phenomenal.   On the other hand, the interior of the place is strange, and not in a good way. If the owner could make the inside a bit more intimate and welcoming, this would be a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Lardon to meet with a friend. I called for reservations on a Tuesday afternoon for later that evening. It was already pretty booked but we got a reservation for 8:30 p.m..  Lardon is not a large space. Like many of the restaurants in area, there's seating for about 50 people and the night I went there were two groups of about 15 people each. One was a birthday party and one just looked to be a group of friends.  Needless to say this made the noise level in the restaurant almost unbearable. My friend and I had to yell at each other and the server had to lean in to tell us the specials. It made a great meal and a nice decor an unfavourable experience.  So ... with that being said I was super pleased with the service, meal and decor of Lardon. I opted for the Prix Fixe menu that included either a soup or salad, any main course and a dessert. My friend opted for the same.   The beet salad I had was light, crisp and flavourful. I had the duck confit for my entrée and creme brulee for dessert. I expected the entrée to be a bit smaller than the regular because of it being part of the prix fixe menu. But it was a full size duck with potatoes and it was DELISH!!!!! I haven't had a lot of duck in my life but this is what it's like I'm going to have a lot more.  The beer selection was great for a restaurant this size including a selection of beer from Unibroue which will mess you up in one bottle. The wine list was also to my friend's liking.  I'd go back but I would be sure to ask if there were any large parties booked for the time I was wanting to go. Based on that my rating is three stars. Another time without the large groups and it might go up. I'll have to go back to see!  TO SUM IT UP: Food and service were great but they might have well had a decibel metre with a picture of the maitre 'd with their hand to their ear on the TV screens."}
{"text":"\"It was a romantic candlelit dinner during earth hour tonight. Candles were carefully placed on each table as they slowly dimmed out all the lights. With delicious food and friendly service, we chatted and giggled the night away, knowing that we were in good hands. The waitress cleared the dishes from our table and finally brought out the chef's last creation for us... the double smoked bacon with maple ice cream! The smokiness filled the air... the sweetness from the maple and the saltiness from the bacon were an impeccable match! And the cookie crumbs on the bottom left me craving for more as I devoured this scrumptious dessert to the very last bite...\" *daydreaming back 3 nights ago* lol.  Okay, back to yelping reviews :) Been here on 2 separate occasions. A year ago, my date and I stumbled upon Lardon while randomly checking out the Roncesvalles neighborhood. Second time, it was my suggestion to have a GNO with my friends... and it was an amazing evening, just the way I remembered it the first time!   There is only one chef (also the owner), so service can be held back a bit if you're with a larger group. The food is worth the wait. And be sure to make reservations, even during a weekday... it gets busy on very random days too!  I'd highly recommend the following:  1) Portabello fries - thick-cut mushroom strips, lightly battered, and paired with a mayo dipping sauce (ordered this both the times I visited!) 2) Duck Confit - falls-off-the-bone good, meat was very tender, and the skin had a light crispiness to it... I want more!! 3) Double smoked bacon with maple ice cream - needless to say more :)  4/5 stars for now... Lardon, you're definitely getting there!"}
{"text":"Unlike all the other trendy new spots on Roncesvalles, these guys happily took my mid-week reservation for 10 on the same day with no attitude. Prix fixe night is a steal at 3 courses for $25... and get this: you can order any main you like off the REGULAR menu. No cheapie hangar steak in sight! Fun service, decent wine list, excellent execution on a fairly traditional menu. Super solid, would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Lardon last night and the food and service was amazing.  Great prices and great tasting food.  Best duck confit we have ever where  and the hangar steak was very tender.   The grilled calamari appetizer was done perfectly and the carrot butter for our bread was delicious. Would definitely go again to try their other dishes"}
{"text":"Took a friend their for a birthday dinner and can't say enough good things about Lardon! Beautiful ambiance, great for a date night. Out waitress who also served as bartender, was friendly and attentive, made us delicious cocktails. Favourite appetizer of the night was the portobello fries! Never tried anything like this and it was delicious (and addictive)! My beef bourguignon was flavourful and tender. Got to sample my bf's huge plate of pork belly which was divine! Highlight of my nite was dessert- smoky bacon ice cream was AMAZING, and creme brûlée was one of the best I've ever had. Would highly recommend Lardon for any occasion!"}
