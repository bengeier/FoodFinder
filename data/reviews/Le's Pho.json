{"text":"Not my favourite Pho house but more than adequate.  Helps it's also in one of my favourite shopping areas.  My usual is spring rolls and rare beef pho.  I never leave unsatisfied and it's definitely good value for my money.  Definitely recommend if good, decent pho is what you're craving."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite pho place in Calgary...

I always get the Satay chicken noodle soup in regular size which is my favourite thing to order. Their soup base, vegetables, and chicken are delicious and the prices are cheap. My only gripe is they don't offer vegetable spring rolls as an appetizer. 

Service is minimal but prompt. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here after going to stupid store. Boyfriend and I both got the Rare beef noodle soup. It was really good and filling. Pho is pretty hard to mess up. 

The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because our waitress was pretty rude, she didn't even make the effort to come across the room to greet up. she just yelled at us and pointed to a table, and did that with every other person that followed. We will probably be back after an Ikea trip or something."}
{"text":"Service was quick. I had the pork chop with shredded pork with rice. It comes with one porkchop, a little bit of shredded pork, a couple slices of cucumber, a small salad which is made up of lettuce and carrots, and rice.
The piece of pork I had was very fatty, but tasted okay.
The one one thing I did notice upon getting my dish, was that the plate underneath was dirty. This kinda turned me off a bit, but I still ate my meal.
I've been here before, and for some reason it doesn't feel very clean inside. Maybe it's in my head.  You can judge for yourself."}
{"text":"Fast service and decent price, but that's the extent of my positive experience. 

I ordered their seafood pho, which came out within 5 mins, but I had a couple shrimps and a few meagre pieces of fake crab floating in my bowl. I went with their regular size, which was plenty for me. 

For now, I wouldn't recommend their pho. I'll check out their rice and vermicelli dishes and update my review from there."}
{"text":"I am not sure what kind of cuisine this is... it didn't really taste like Vietnamese to me at all, more like Chinese. 

I had some good expectations going in, the interior was cute and we were greeted promptly but felt rushed and kind of ignored. 

When our salad rolls came they were good and fresh but that's where the freshness ended... Our rice noodle bowl tasted more like a chow mein stir fry with vermicelli, which was good but it wasn't what we expected. 

The spring rolls tasted like they were frozen from a box and when my Vietnamese iced coffee came, that was when it was all over. It tasted like the pre-mixed version from the carton that you can buy from T&T. I had one or two sips before giving up on it all together.

I don't think I'll coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a very good Vietnamese restaurant. I had the medium special beef noodle soup. Very good, with a strawberry bubble tea. Decor and service was efficient and nice. Nice high ceilings.  I would strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a good place for when your Vietnamese food cravings kicks in. Very affordable with enough variety of food choices. The taste never disappoints, the service is satisfactory, amd it has a good simple ambiance."}
{"text":"It doesn't look too clean and the noodle dish I ate was ok, had better Vietnamese dishes somewhere else. The noodles had weird texture and it had some powdery stuff. Their bubble tea was priced at $5.50  and the waitress said it was made of fresh fruit as we have specifically informed we wanted fresh fruit but it tasted that it's made with powder and our bill indicated $6.50 because there was extra $1 charge (which we were not informed of) because we asked for fresh fruit. The bubble tea claimed to be made of fresh strawberries did not have the strawberry seeds you can taste from fresh strawberries. Will not come back to this place!!!"}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary. I drive 30 Kms to reach it but it is worth. My favorite dish is the Satay Chicken Noodles soup, the regular size is more than enough."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Pho soup.  I'm not even sure if it's called Pho soup but it's the best none the less.  I always order the #24 which is a spicy curry coconut broth with beef and chicken.  If this sounds like your thing, you should try it here.  They are super fast and the large bowl is huge.  I don't think I've ever finished it but it always tastes great the next day warmed up. 
The salad rolls are pretty good and the rice bowls are as well but I come here for the soup!!!"}
{"text":"I came down with a bad cold this winter.  And when I have a cold, all I want to eat is soup.  I'd passed by Le's a number of times when in Deerfoot Meadows, so finally decided to check it out.  Overall, the service for take-out was pretty quick and the restaurant was fairly quiet.  Food is reasonably priced and the pho was pretty yummy.  I seem to recall from driving by at other times that they had some limited hours - but I would definitely go back for take-out in the future."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times now.  Very consistent pho.  

Usually come after shopping.  Try the salad rolls too. Super fresh. 

I usually always get the rate beef noodle pho, so boring but it is amazing.  Especially good for a hangover!!"}
{"text":"Soup was pretty good but a little salty. Service was friendly and price was pretty good. I'd go back but they do not take American Express. MasterCard and visa only. That's a bit of a pain for me!"}
{"text":"After a quick shopping trip in Deerfoot Meadows my fiancé and I needed to sneak in a quick dinner before heading DT for the evening. We conveniently saw \"Le's Pho\", looks like just \"PHO - Vietnamese Cuisine & Grill\" from a distance as the \"Le's\" is squeezed under the bowl in the sign hehe. I quickly checked some reviews online and it looked decent enough. We both love Viet and it had been a while, so we decided to give it a go.

We were quickly greeted and seated upon entering, I wasn't a big fan of how we were seated right next to another table where they had a bunch of empty tables throughout the restaurant but it didn't bug me enough to make a point about it. It's decently sized inside despite looking small from the outside, the décor is pretty plan and simple. It was fairly quiet when we got there but it looks like they can seat a fair bit of people. 

When it comes to Viet food we both usually have our go-to choices, I'll get some form of pho and she'll get vermicelli w/ spring Rolls. So we didn't really navigate the menu for more than a minute or so. I did deviate a bit and opt for a chicken satay pho rather than my usual rare sliced beef as I figured the chicken would work better with my current diet. Despite chicken being healthier I wasn't too excited for it since chicken I've had in previous pho orders (at other places) has been a bit \"icky\" and unappealing. The chicken satay pho at Le's Pho was a definite exception, the chicken itself appeared to be very thinly sliced chicken breast; it was very clean and looked well prepared. Much better than I was expecting! I was also quite impressed with the satay broth it was the right balance of spiciness and flavour, one of the better broths I've had in the city. My fiancé's vermicelli and spring rolls was well prepared and pretty much on par with most places, she was happy with the order. We did like how they cut up the spring rolls and put them around the exterior of the bowl rather than clumping them, burying them or putting the whole roll in.  

For service I'll be honest, I have extremely low expectations when it comes to service at Vietnamese restaurants. I treat these as more of a fast food type restaurant rather than a formal sit-down restaurant, since you pay at the register rather than at the table at most places, I think this is fair to say. That being said my only real expectations are that the food comes out quick and we get drink service/refills, anything else is bonus. Our order came out super quick as expected, we got our water, just no refills :(. All in all it was a good experience though, the food is good, service and establishment is adequate and the price is right. If I'm in Deerfoot Meadows again and craving Pho I'll be back, but given the odd location I don't see myself going out of my way to come back for my next Viet craving."}
{"text":"Today's lunch was a 5*.... ok... maybe like a 4* + 0.5* for being in the South!
Sooo.... 5* for south Pho?! haha... ok... so maybe a 4*...

The place was busy and so I'm surprised no one else has reviewed it! They probably don't want anyone else to find out. Well, I'll let the cat out of the bag! Located across the parking lot from Michael's & BestBuy is 'Le Pho' but looking at the sign, all you really see from afar is 'PHO'.

-Pho came out hot & steaming - just the way I like it!
-Good service for a Pho joint
-Good size portions & Great prices! LOVE!  (I hate it when portion sizes are smaller and pricier just cuz their South of Glenmore) ... this place does it right!
-Beef & Brisket slices were tender and had the right proportion of beef, noodles, and soup.  
-They gave me a nice juicy chunky piece of lime! 
-Soup was tasty and not overly salty or watered down (msg or not, don't know but i didn't notice any signs that stated no msg...)
- decor is awesome! hahah not snooty or trying to be 'westernized' or 'fancy'.  Lots of wood etc.  They kept it real.... spoons and chopsticks out on table in trays, condiments readily available (and not sticky yet haha).  Centre area has a few rows of tables pushed together so basically like a communal table/shared seating-ish kinda thing.  

Left warm and fuzzy full :) haha"}
{"text":"We got hungry while shopping in Deerfoot Meadows and wanted Viet food but didn't want to go to Tango.

The location is great in the mall area and it wasn't busy on a Saturday lunch time when we got in.  The restaurant is not large but a decent size restaurant that is decorated nicely.

Service was quick and loved that they automatically came out with cold water for the table.  We ordered the #14 Pho w/rare beef, flank, tripe, tendon & beef brisket and #29 Bun w/spring rolls.  Both portions were decent and the broth for the pho was nicely flavoured.

I also enjoyed the spring rolls - crispy and flavourful.  I also ordered an iced coffee with condensed milk which was ok.

Overall - decently priced and convenient.  Will come back if in the area and hungry."}
{"text":"A good choice for a quick meal when you're shopping in the area. As with most restaurants of this style the level of service is minimal with someone gesturing to you from across the restaurant to sit at a particular table, then a quick ordering process, and a final \"anything else\" finish.

The food always comes very quickly, is inexpensive for the portion size, though isn't of the highest of qualities at times. I usually get the same thing and I've never been let down here."}
{"text":"I don't live in the SW anymore but was down here running errands and famished. So - it's pretty rare for me NOT to add siracha or sambala to satay as I don't find it hot enough. Was so surprised at the speed of my order, how fresh everything was and absolutely tasty the pho was. Delicious food and very good service. Will be back!"}
