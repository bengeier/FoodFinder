{"text":"When it comes to pizza this place knows what they are doing. Lots of cheese, great tasting sauce, the dough has really good flavor. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars (5 pizza place stars) is because a couple times the underneath of the crust was cooked unevenly. It's probably their oven but never the less the pizza is great and I really wish their business the best. That area is a bit of a challenge. I look forward to checking out the rest of their menu but every time we order the pizza just calls my name!"}
{"text":"Got from here several times. Sausage hoagie, buffalo chicken, and Italian hoagie were good.  The mozzarella sticks are great too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in a week or so ago and got a steak cheese hogie. It was really good. I'll follow up once I get pizza."}
{"text":"Nope, Im good on this place. CHeese was hard and cold, crust was like eating a brick. The staff was clueless, the cooks even more clueless. I stopped here out of dire need while on a roadtrip, ill starve next time."}
{"text":"Ordered large cheese & pepperoni pizza, and the deluxe pizza and it was AMAZING!!! Will order from again!!!"}
