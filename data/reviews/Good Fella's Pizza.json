{"text":"My flight was cancelled to Raleigh so i got a room not to far from the airport. Asked Siri (iPhone) for some good local pizza Goodfellas popped up  i ordered the meat lovers special. Pizza was great! Staff was very friendly.  If you are ever in Cleveland make sure you check out goodfellas!"}
{"text":"Great local joint. We've frequented Goodfellas for the past 6 months and the owner is there everytime. We really like to support mom and pop establishments and this is  a real gem. The pizza is really tasty and consistently so."}
{"text":"Epic road trip stop 4. I noticed this place months ago and wanted to try the pie. Strictly carry out, no dining space. Real greaseball shit. I ordered a double large deal for twenty bucks. That was all the money we had, Karen!! These pies are actual larges not like Angelo's. Did I just insult Angelo's? A little bit, a little bit. Better than most franchise crap and done in twenty minutes on the nose. Help me out Henry, I'm trying to write a review here. If you are in Middleburg, this should be your go-to for za. Lots of leftovers. You touch my pie again and you're dead!!   Want some other movie references? OK. For us to eat pizza any other way was nuts.  These guys work hard, all the time stirring the sauce. I'll refrain from the Joe Pesci \"am I a clown?\" bit."}
