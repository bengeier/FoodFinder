{"text":"The salmon tartare was not fresh, it was warm and had a mushy/slimy texture. I also found a lot of salmon skin inside the tartare, took 2 bites and sent back the plate. Hope I don't get sick from it...

Service was OK."}
{"text":"We were in Montreal in early February and happened to stop in as we were looking for a place in the neighborhood that had Boreale on tap. Turns out they have a great bar and several Boreale on tap, including my favorite, Blonde.

The poutine with smoked meat was FANTASTIC! So were the wings. 

Service was friendly, the chef/owner is charming, and the location very convenient.

This will be my first place to eat at next time I'm in Montreal. 

Tell your friends."}
{"text":"Le service et la nourriture sont excellents! Nous avons commandé des hamburgers et des poutines, grandes portions et très bon goût! L'arrêt à ce restaurant vaut le détour pour manger ce type de plat, nous y retournerons certainement!"}
{"text":"Très bonne nourriture avec des produits de qualité. Le service est vraiment très bon!"}
{"text":"Salmon tartare was way too much mayonaisee, feuilletés were so-so...
However, Poutine was deemed really good and service was really great. Not sure it's a 4.1/2 stars though"}
{"text":"All the reviews on service are true.  Our waiter for dinner tonight could not have been kinder or more helpful.  The kitchen on the other hand was disappointing.  All three of us ordered burgers and we all had burnt fries.  They weren't exactly burnt through but they tasted burnt and had flecks of black ash on them.  We sent them back and no more than 10 minutes later the waiter came back with new plates.  I think possibly something went wrong in the kitchen (with the oil?) because the second time they still had a slight charred taste I couldn't get past.  Left most of the fries behind.  Not sure I'd come back."}
{"text":"This is my second time here.  Went with a group like usual.  If restaurants can't handle groups they should advise us as organizers or split the group up.  I wouldn't have minded the group to be split up in two or even three. I would have been ready and willing to have three tables and each table properly served than one large table and badly handled by both waitress and manager.
There seemed to be too many complaints from my group, we were 20.  Not enough service on their end but not only the service or food.  It was their reaction to US.  We are a basically Anglophone Group in a French City. They seemed to be short in the kitchen.  Bad!  Food coming out cold, some forgotten to come out.  :-(  The worst was the waitress's reaction to my English participants, like we were stupid.  This was definitely not a job for her.  Manager not any better she agreed with the waitress tof defending US the Consumers!  What happened to THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.  I have done Customer Service for several years myself. 
I ordered the Linguini with scallops and shrimps and sun-dried tomatoes and spinach this dish was on their Table d'hôte.  My dish was too salty and way too greasy!  It was literally swimming in oil. 
The service was bad because of the waitress's reaction to us but I was expecting the food to be better since I'd already been there and loved their fried and burgers. Maybe we should have all ordered just fries and burger!!  
We go out as a group and often to socialize and enjoy a great meal.  This experience kind of blew the candle out before lighting!  I will say no more!"}
{"text":"My sister, my cousin and myself decided to stop in for dinner around 8pm. We had tried to go to two other places before, but they were both closed. We were hungry and just looking for reasonably priced dinner and drinks. When we walked in, there was only one other table occupied, which was strange in such a large restaurant. We seated ourselves and ordered waters to start while we perused the menu. We settled on drink and dinner orders, and the waitress went behind the bar to make our drinks. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri, my cousin ordered a margarita. When we got the drinks, we were underwhelmed. They were essentially flavorless, and they did not taste right. It was not a huge deal; we drank them anyway. However, we had never gotten our water, which was slightly annoying. We just asked for it a second time. 
For dinner, we all ordered burgers with fries and salad. The wait was slightly longer than we were accustomed to, despite the nearly empty restaurant. However, it was worth the wait. I ordered the \"Bleu\" burger and it was very good. We all agreed that the salad was phenomenal. The fries could have been hotter. The portions were quite large, but that was nice, especially for the price. 
Our waitress was very kind and pleasant. 
I would probably not return to this restaurant, but I did not hate it."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant! The place is cool, the food is wonderful and the staff were so warm and friendly. I am spending our vacation in Canada and this is by far the favorite restaurant I have tried in Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"The best kids meals ever. Cotton Candy included, made my kids feel like they were royalty. 
And beautiful food all around. 
Lovely and kind service. Bilingual"}
