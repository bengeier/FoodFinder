{"text":"We has a brunch at Parkers following our sons baptism for a group of family and friends. The staff was amazing and super attentive. The food was delicious and prepared perfectly, and the private room was cozy and intimate. They made planning very easy and I'd recommend it to anyone else looking for something similar any day!"}
{"text":"Arrived about 40 minutes early for our reservation so I was totally fine with sitting at the bar until a table opened up. But as it turned out lots of tables looked open. We waited for about 45 minutes and they sat us at the worst table, that had been open THE ENTIRE TIME. Then they sat people who had been sitting at the bar waiting after us at a way better table. The waitress came and was very nice, she let us know it was half off wine bottles under 60 bucks. I inquired if there could be an exception for 64 and was denied. Obviously all the great wines were purposely priced over the limit. Then the waitress never showed back up. Pretty much, we gave up and left. As a last resort the owner or manager tried to chase us out the door, but we weren't stopping at this point. Nothing was changing our mind about this horrible place. 

Then we went to Strip, a Steakhouse. It was amazing."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Parker's Grille and Tavern! The most recent time I went there was last Friday. It was super busy, but we still got seated rather quickly and I can attest that during the entire dinner our service was spot-on and friendly. 

In a small-ish town such as Avon Lake, the selection for beer and wine is absolutely ridiculous. Furthermore, the prices are incredibly reasonable considering the portion sizes and quality of the food. My brother had the Black-N-Blue Burger (with Cajun spice and blue cheese), which looked and *apparently* tasted delicious. I had the Pork Chops (16 oz. molasses and coffee spiked chop, and smashed reds), which I highly recommend!

In the end, I can't say enough good things about this place; you would be amiss to not go there at least once if you are a native to the Avon area. As stated in other Yelp posts, Parker's Grille and Tavern is a rare find for good American food."}
{"text":"On Tuesday, July 7, my husband and and I with four other people went for dinner because we all agreed it was a great place.  Yes,  the food was delicious and the server fantastic but the management was not.  We had finished dinner and were sitting enjoying the end of dessert and coffees and the manager came to our table and asked if we would mind moving since other customers wanted our table.  Our total bill was probably over $300...now do you think that was appropriate?  We don't!  Wonder who the power people were who wanted our table?

Not sure if we will return."}
{"text":"My husband and I are \"regulars\" ~ we love it there! They have everything from juicy burgers and delicious ribs to amazing steaks.  My favorites are the filet, prime rib, and pork chops! Wonderful wine list but fun beers on tap. Great atmosphere, friendly attentive staff. They also have some great specials that draw a crowd even during the week so make sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner this past weekend.  Service was good. Both of our meals were excellent.  The menu had a lot to choose from and I thought it was very reasonable priced.  I would highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"Our first visit here for our 45th anniversary.  We were a party of eight squeezed on a table that would have been tight for six.  Observing other tables, they were all too small for the service, except for the few booths.  It is hard to enjoy a meal when you are cramped and have the person's sitting next to you elbow in your face .  The room was also very noisy, which you would expect in a Mexican restaurant.
 Generally food and service was ok.  My crab cakes were very good with mostly crab not fillers.  Grilled kale very good.
My husband ordered the grilled salmon which he said was good, but the portion was very small for the price.  It was a 1/2 piece of salmon sitting on a dollop of mash potatoes.   So the salmon is not recommended.
The sever, Anthony, offered us dessert to celebrate our anniversary.  Before we ordered we asked \"a dessert for our anniversary?\", he confirmed yes.  We enjoyed the ultimate mud pie for which he did charge us.  He never said on the house, but we felt he was very deceptive."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful ribeye and filet with bernaise sauce followed by sharing a delightful creme brûlée!  Looking forward
 to our next visit.  Came early and had great service too."}
{"text":"Restaurant week.
Crowded, waited 10 mins for reserve table
Food was excellent (Salad, Filet, Salmon, dessert)
Wine prices fair, cocktails were strong.
I will definitely return"}
{"text":"Great food. Lovely atmosphere. Go with or without kids - service is great. Highly recommend. The lamb chop appetizers are a must!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! I recommend the pretzel appetizer and the house ale that tastes great too. The place has great service and James, the owner, goes out of his way to check on all the tables. 

Atmosphere is light and energetic and the outside patio is a great spot to enjoy their great happy hour."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant in a somewhat empty plaza. What a great find for a Saturday night dinner!

We started the meal with a bottle of wine- Avalon Cab for $22 (not too shabby in my mind). I ordered the Steak Salad while my boyfriend ordered the Forest Mushroom Chicken. We opted to try the Grilled Caesar salad after our waiter explained how it was prepared! The croutons on the salad were amazing and figuring this out we asked if they offered bread. *Note-They will only give you bread if you ask :) The croutons are made from their delicious multi-grain bread. Yum!

My steak was cooked to absolute perfection and this has me wanting to visit again and try one of the steaks as my meal. The Forest Mushroom Chicken was accompanied by mashed cauliflower which made my boyfriend very hesitant but woo wee was it delicious! We both definitely underestimated the idea of mashed cauliflower (I've been looking up recipes to make it at home).

The other thing I really like about this restaurant is the GM/Owner was the one to open our bottle of wine, he came over and asked us how our meal was as well as wishing us a goodnight as we walked out the door. This goes a long way for me and definitely makes me want to come back!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good corned beef sandwich outside of slimans in Cleveland, but parkers gets it done. The sandwich was awesome, the service was awesome, and the location is easy to get to but still secluded. The atmosphere inside is great, they carry rare craft beers. This place is just overall great, I will definitely be eating here again, and again, and again...and again. Probably the best restaurant I've eaten at in Avon lake so far, and I've eaten at almost all of them. The prior statement may not mean much as the quality in the city is sub-par, but Parkers grill is definitely on the same playing field as some of the more upper-echelon restaurants in the greater Cleveland area. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area. The chimay blue goes very well with the Ruben."}
{"text":"Excellent service but the food was underwhelming. Started with bread that was very hard. Then had Cajun lamb for an appetizer that was really pretty good. Ordered a Caesar salad that ended up being a wedge and didn't taste like a Casar salad at all. Got the prime rib and it was bland and unimaginative. The mashed red potatoes were tasty. My GF thought the steak salad was decent but had french fries on the bottom which was odd. Willing to try again but disappointed."}
{"text":"Love going to Parkers for their Norm Burger!  Honestly...it is the best burger I have ever eaten in my life.  The meat is so flavorful...juicy...add that perfectly fried egg, mushrooms, onions and cheese...OMG!   Now...I am certain the other entrees are fantastic too but I cannot get past that burger!  Can highly recommend the warm pretzel appetizer, calamari, chips with balsamic (cannot remember what they are called).  Great beer and wine list and James the owner is always there helping in any way he can and making sure his patrons are happy.  Only gave a 4 star rating because it can be very loud in there...sometimes difficult to converse with the folks you are dining with but that is the nature of this type of establishment.   Welcome to Avon Lake, Parker's Grille & Tavern...so glad to have you!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place (last year), I would give it 5 stars for food & service. Last night going there, I would give the food 5 stars and the service 3 stars. We walked in, asked for a booth and the hostess immediately said \"all my booths are reserved\" but she could've been more friendly about it. The food was amazing as it always is! Our server was not very friendly either. She brought the bread out after the appetizers (we already ate appetizers on our plates so those were stacked on the table and dirty) and she didn't bring new plates for the bread so we ate the bread on our drink napkins. She also forgot to take our order. I had to waive her down 45 minutes later to give our order. She didn't offer salad or soup or anything to go with our dinners. For the price of the food, I would expect better service. The pork dinners and steak dinners were amazing! The drinks are good too."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. The pork chop, ribs, steaks, and walleye are to die for. Has something for everyone and is very accommodating for the guests needs. The owners are wonderful and are very involved in making sure you had a great experience. Can't say enough good things about this place! Definitely call to make reservations because they fill up fast!"}
{"text":"Overall an excellent experience. Food, atmosphere, and service was all on the mark. I took my elderly grandmother there and they were especially accommodating. The pretzel sticks and the bread pudding were delish. The server was able to pair wines with my food selections. Top notch!"}
{"text":"Nothing to criticize so I'm giving it 5 stars. Dinner for 4 on a Sunday night was very enjoyable. Started with the beef brisket chili/soup that was delicious. Just enough heat (cayenne pepper & cumin) for my taste. Not a fan of bland food. Grilled swordfish special ($21) was cooked perfectly as was the grilled asparagus. Desert was bread pudding with vanilla ice cream. Above average wine list and a good selection of beers. James (the GM) made us feel like valued regulars even though this was our first visit. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We shared the cowboy.  Good steak nice atmosphere.  Good price. The right amount of noise and people.  The bar area is very comfortable as well."}
{"text":"This is a very good grille and tavern nestled out in Avon Lake - wonderful atmosphere and pleasurable service. The prices are appropriate for the quality and portions of food.  It's a large enough place to accommodate large groups and enjoy the fellowship but has many areas to enjoy and intimate and romantic dinner with a special person - as I did. I ventured out and tried the pork tenderloin (I usually don't order this dish) I was very glad I did; ''twas an excellent choice. Perfectly seasoned, cooked just right and very succulent. Also - of you enjoy a good wedge salad, this place makes it great! All in all - Parker's is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Parkers has a great atmosphere/vibe and is a cool place to meet up, have some drinks, and eat some delicious food. 

Would highly recommend making a reservation if you have a big party. I was with 3 people last time on a Friday and we ended up sitting at the bar because it was an hour wait. Bartender was friendly and they have a great micro-brew list along with a large cocktail menu ($$$). 

Bartender suggested that the ribs were the best I would ever have so I tried those. They were very tender and the sauce was fantastic, but was disappointed by the lack of meat on the bones. 

I'm excited to go back and try some of their other menu options. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This rating is for brunch only. Parker's is now open for brunch and it is amazing...check it out! Avon Lake has so few unique brunch options, this is a nice addition. 

Also, we sat on their patio which was so nice for a beautiful Sunday morning."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. If you're out for a nice dinner with that special someone or going to a bar with some friends, this place can accommodate. Steaks are prepared exactly how you order. Mushroom side is drop your pants good. The lamb is fantastic too."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other day and I was very pleased.  The food is fresh.  There is great care in the menu as it all looked good.  I would highly suggest this to anyone who wants a great fresh meal."}
{"text":"The prime rib special is a must have while visiting Parkers. Comes with a salad, side and choice of dessert.  The calamari is a great appetizer and the sauce is exceptional.

This is a Avon Lake gem."}
{"text":"Was at Parker's on a Thursday evening recently and the patio was teeming with people and the restaurant had a nice size crowd.  The menu was the first thing to hit me.  Everything from good looking apps, the chips are awesome, to sandwiches, burgers and entrees.  

My wife had the walleye, and it was outstanding!  My filet was a bit over done, but still very good.  Wine was great and the atmosphere was both great for a couple on a date to a family out together.  

We will be back soon and often!  Come on Avon Lake -- we deserve another great restaurant!   See you there."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner Thursday night. We  started with the Caesar salad and it was great. We loved the charred taste and the dressing was excellent. My husband had the steak with crab and I had the robs. Both dinners were delicious. Great flavors and generous portions. The owner made sure to greet everyone and our server, Steve was knowledgeable about the menu and provided very good service. We have been at the three restaurants that were in this spot before and this is by far the best. Try it, you will be pleased."}
{"text":"Just went to this restaurant for the first time. We went early on Valentine evening at it was busy. We ordered the new calamari appetizer and it was way too spicy. The steak which is what they are known for was awful and indelible. The first steak was undercooked. They brought me a second steak that had no flavor. The sides were boring and for 25.oo were not worth it. Will not be bsck."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about the food and service at Parker's.  We held the rehearsal dinner for our wedding at Parker's and everything was fantastic.  Mitzi, the Event Coordinator, was wonderful to work with.  She was extremely prompt and professional both in person and in all her e-mail correspondence. The event room looked beautiful the day of and the food came out hot, delicious, and plentiful.  They were extremely accommodating by allowing us to text them when we were on our way so that the appetizers could be ready when guests began arriving.  Gerad the manager and James the owner went above and beyond to ensure everything was up to par and were constantly checking to make sure everyone was happy.  The food was great and it was such a lovely evening, I couldn't imagine getting such good service at any other restaurant in the area.  

In addition to the rehearsal dinner, my family and I have eaten at Parker's for dinner many times.  We have never had a bad experience or a bad meal.  Thanks for being such a great addition to Avon Lake, you definitely have my business for life!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on a saturday night and were surprised to see how busy it was being so new.  We had a very good experience from the food to the overly attentive server.  Wine list and beer list are excellent and I loved that they have Kentucky Bourbon Ale on tap...what a great beer.  We were also very impressed our server offered to bring a sample of a wine we have never tried to help us make up our mind.  We will be back."}
{"text":"It's a pretty nice place. Had a few good and average experiences here. However the last experience wasn't good. They took eons to wait on us after we were seated (15-20 min) and then my appetizer had a bug floating in it. Then my meat was way undercooked. They happily took it back and of course it then returned overcooked. For the price I'm not sure we would recommend again."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend at Parker's Grille & Tavern on 2-4-17.  We had reservations for 6:30pm, and although the place was almost completely full when we arrived, we did not have to wait.  Our server was very good.  A basket of napped, warm, whole grain bread and butter was brought to our table and then our order was taken.  My friend ordered the Friday and Saturday night special, a 12 oz. prime rib dinner with a grilled ceasar salad, smashed redskins and dessert--at $29.99.  I ordered the 18 oz. ribeye steak w/asparagus at $35.00 and a side of smashed cauliflower ($5.00 extra). Cream and butter are added to pureed cauliflower, with a dash of salt and pepper--extremely luscious and satisfying.  The prime rib was cooked perfectly, expertly seasoned sans garlic--a most welcome departure.  My steak was prepared exactly as I ordered it, and it, too, was exceptionally flavorful and juicy.  The place has extremely high, industrial looking ceilings and the longest bar I've ever seen.  My friend took his dessert to go.  Dessert was a lovely slice of cheesecake with a red berry drizzle and a piped dollop of whipped cream.  There is plenty on the menu that is less expensive than what we ordered.  The cheeseburgers looked sumptuous.  The sandwiches and burgers range in price from $10 to $13 and all appear to come with French fries.  They have a very nice looking happy hour menu w/all items priced at $5.00 (duck wings, walleye sliders and several other more traditional items.)"}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Parker's Grille & Tavern and it was delicious! We started with the pretzel appetizer with 3 dips, yum!  I had and loved the beer cheese soup and wedge salad!  My husband had a mushroom burger with fries and coleslaw. He said the burger on a brioche roll was done perfectly and was big and juicy.  Friends who dined with us had the walleye and Margherita flatbread and both said their meals were outstanding.  Our server was Wally and he was efficient and helpful with a great sense of humor. Though a little loud, it had a fun atmosphere.  We will definitely be returning in the not too distant future!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, excellent environment, reasonable prices and the best grilled salmon I've had lately. Great selection of beers. The owner was even nice, checking on my grandfather and I to make sure the service was excellent. Come here!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time for my husband's birthday. Morgan was a very tentative server. We enjoyed the happy hour pretzels, grilled Caesar salad, shrimp scampi and burger. The drinks were fantastic!"}
{"text":"I would give this two and a half stars if I could but it doesn't warrant three. Service was decent and food came out hot. I ordered the shrimp scampi pasta and the general flavors were good, but the dish was spoiled by the extremely over cooked shrimp- like over cooked into rubber play food territory. They are supposed to be the stars of the dish and I actually left a few in the bowl uneaten in the end. I also had several tomatoes in the bowl that tasted past their prime. $18 later I left feeling disappointed about a dish that could have been..."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place for dinner. Very friendly staff and great food. To date, we have enjoyed the mussels, underground chips, the PG&T burger, the ribs, pork chop, prime rib and walleye.  I've had the ribs on three occasions and they were cooked perfectly every time.  They also have a wonderful assortment of wines and draft beers."}
{"text":"I only gave 3 stars because even though the server was very knowledgeable the service was mediocre at best waited almost 10 minutes before I got a drink or even acknowledged. The ambiance was very nice and relaxed and good place for dinner on a Thursday not crowded but busy. All in all a nice establishment with some degree of service upgrade needed. I ordered the pan fried walleye which was only warm when delivered to my table. Good taste and a large fillet but not hot when delivered which may relate to my earlier comment of slow service."}
{"text":"Parker's is a great neighborhood find.  Every time I walk through the door, the owner is on point with a warm greeting.  I normally eat at the bar and their food is mainly a modern take on american classics.  My fave is their grilled caesar salad, but their root veg chips with blue cheese and a balsamic glaze are also a hit.  They have half price glasses of wine on Thursdays with no limitations.  It's a nice way to treat yourself to a higher end glass of wine.  The vibe is cool, mostly regular clientele, cozy atmosphere, beautiful patio with bar.  Service is always great, the server's uniforms could just use an update."}
{"text":"Friday evening is busy but we got to be seated immediately around 7:45pm. The service was efficient. Vegetarian options are limited. The drink menu is extensive. The cocktails were strong enough to give a buzz. Well worth the $8:50. 
The buffalo chicken flat bread had chunky pieces of chicken and blue cheese and it had adequate spice and was on a pretzel flat bread and was yummy. The forest mushroom chicken with mashed cauliflower was well made and tasty. Inside of the restaurant was slightly dark. By 8:30pm quite a few empty seating were available however the bar area was buzzing. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very comfortable and pretty but it was a little chilly in there so bring a jacket if you are a freeze baby. My server was attentive, full of suggestions and just all around awesome! Got the chicken Mac n cheese and it was unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Great time. Stopped by for a casual dinner to find that they had a musician. Very nice touch as Parkers has a nice vibe. Great salads , burgers and entrees. I had the shrimp and grits that was great ."}
{"text":"Home run of an eating experience. Wife had the crab cakes, I had the hanger steak. Bother were delicious. Had to get the pretzels as an appetizer and they were good as well. Lively atmosphere for a cold Saturday night. Looking  forward to the leftovers along with a slice of key lime pie."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with a couple of friends on a busy Saturday night. We had reservations and were seated within about 15 minutes. The workers were very friendly - although our waiter kept checking to make sure everything was OK or if we needed anything about every 5 minutes. Now it's great to have attentive help, but this was a little bit intrusive into our conversation and could probably use a little tweaking.

The food was very good with excellent flavor and prepared just the way we ordered it. The prices were reasonable. The ambiance is acceptable although the acoustics are such that there is an elevated noise level going on which made me have to raise my voice a bit to be heard during our conversation. Aside from that, I would recommend Parker's for a night out and look forward to going in the summer when the patio is open."}
{"text":"I have never had such a consistently bad dinner.  Every item we ordered was just awful.  Salmon undercooked, but ordered medium well.  Side of augratin potatoes were nothing but cheese and croutons . . . couldn't even find a potato!  The brussel sprouts were shaved so thin they were nearly indistinguishable, and overwhelmed by entirely too much bacon.  My husband's caesar salad was a disaster - just a head of romaine lettuce laying on it's side, trying to mimic \"the wedge.\"  We were told the key lime pie was too small to share . . . . it was HUGE.  Won't share the details of our two other couples dinner, but suffice it to say, none of us will be back."}
{"text":"We are regulars at Parker's and I have never written a review so I feel like I owe them one. We prefer the bar scene over the restaurant only because we like the interaction with bartenders and other patrons. The service is always excellent and the food never fails to please. The soups are always outstanding as are the salads and burgers. The wine and beer selections are great and the bartenders seem to make great mixed drinks as well. Wednesday nights feature a local musician that appeals to a wide range of ages. It's a great addition and it's not so loud that it makes conversation difficult. We have dined in the restaurant area several times and the service is no different there - excellent! The owner is always there and always makes a point to say hello. I believe it's why this restaurant has done so well and will continue to do so. I definitely recommend Parkers!"}
{"text":"Went to parkers for early dinner. Nice place inside. Nice patio with western exposure. Great beer and drink menu. Local Great Lakes, Thirsty dog and fatheads well represented, as well as some Cali classics like Stone, and Lagunitas. Menu is great with good selection. I ordered the Ribs. They were really good. Others at my table ordered the Cuban, and the Shrimp and grits. Was told the shrimp and grits weren't spicy at all. ..Not sure if it was supposed to be though. They looked good. Portions were large. 
My only complaint was the fries were kind of hard and dry.  I'd go again if in the neighborhood but wouldn't get the fries."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere.  Very good food.  Felt rushed by waiter.  Will recommend and go back."}
{"text":"Went there last night and had a great time! Everything was reasonably priced, the spiced pork tenderloin was good, I especially enjoyed the mashed reds! I started with the house salad with 1000 island dressing, it had way too much dressing, the toppings were good but not enough to taste through the dressing. Service was great and they were very prompt!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Parker's the first week of the new year.  2018. The food was great BUT the room was freezing.   The outside temp was 14 but that's no reason for all of the restaurant goers to  have to wear their winter coats.  I had the pork chop which was delicious.  It took away from the eating experience trying to stay warm.  
Great food - if you are an Eskimo."}
{"text":"Nice place!  Good atmosphere, friendly and attentive wait staff and excellent food.  I had the 8 oz Filet Oscar.  It was very good, not enough of the oscar part, but still very good.  Also had the wedge salad that was also good.
Tried a piece of the spice rubbed pork chop which was amazing- will definitely be ordering that next time.

This Is a gem in Avon Lake and I hope word gets out so they don't disappear like many other places in this same location over the years.
Only negative is that the restaurant can get very loud - just the way the acoustics work in there I guess - so for a quiet, intimate dinner, get a booth in the back.  Otherwise, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good steak. The calamari was very good, and the peppers and sauce with it gave it a different taste. Only thing I would like to see, would be more steak options, even just a couple more would be nice. Will be back again to try other entrées!"}
{"text":"Recently ate dinner at Parkers Grille and let me say I was very impressed. I had their prime rib special(which they have on Saturdays). It included your choice of a wedge or grilled caesar salad. I went with the caesar. It was delicious. Prime Rib was cooked perfectly to a medium rare temp and came with mashed red skins. The potatoes needed a tad more seasoning IMHO but they were good. For dessert, you had a choice of cheesecake or bread pudding. I had strawberry cheesecake bread pudding. It was awesome. This was all for $30 which is VERY reasonable. 

Our server was very attentive and did an outstanding job. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was there last evening. Service was very slow. Waitress took our drink order and it took 20 minutes for her to return to tell us  that the bottle of wine was not available.  We ordered a second bottle, and also another bottle of different type of wine for the remaining part of the party. The waitress then returned with The second bottle we ordered but again not the first. Waitress then returned a few minutes later to tell us that the second bottle was not available. We decided then to order by the glass. It was quite a shock that the only one available was in the more expensive category.

Once our dinner finally arrived, two of the entrées were hardly edible. When the manager visited the table, we expressed our concerns. He made excuses but did not apologize!  Most of our party are repeat customers and will likely not return."}
{"text":"What can I say!! Cowboy ribeye!! AMAZING!! I have had a number of other dishes and they Have been excellent. Servers and ownership great!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place deserves 5 stars!  Top shelf service & food all the way around!"}
{"text":"parkers. hhhmmm. i think i liked it better when michael symon's restaurant occupied the building....just sayin. 

nothing out of the world spectacular. i had a burger. just a regular old burger. i am a burger girl and love when i can give high fives to an amazing beef meal. it was just ok. 

we ate on the patio which is pretty, but again nothing out of this world. would i go back? perhaps, as i believe in giving everyone a second chance. i think i would try something on the dinner menu and see if that will easily wow me next time!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday evening, sat outside: ordered the grilled Ceasar salad - the dressing was very watery and had a ton of vinegar in it.  Hated it!  The salad greens were just flashed on the grill and the croutons tasted packaged.  My husband had the pork tenderloin which was a bit salty but edible and reasonably priced.  I ordered the wild mushroom chicken - I am a mushroom freak and I hate it when restaurants loosely  use the term \"Wild,\"  face it they were crimini's nothing wild about them, but the sauce was good not fab and the chicken was well seasoned and grilled nicely. 

Lets face it the place is new and will have to work out some kinks - we will give it another shot next month or so.  I wish them the best but I think the Chef needs to step up his game because so far I am not a Fan but I would really like to be."}
{"text":"Parker's is a tavern with a fairly upscale feel.  It is a little pricey, but I have never had a bad meal here.  It is definitely a very popular restaurant with the locals, so if you plan on going on a weekend, you might want to get their little early if you have plans.  Their drinks are fantastic as well.  Their menu seems a bit repetitive, but what else would you expect from a tavern?"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of women after a sporting event. Drinks were good. Then it went downhill especially for me. I ordered a $27 fillet which I had to send back because the meat was mealy. Also every 8oz fillet I have ever ordered was at least 1-2\" thick. This was 1/2\" and looked like something I would get at country buffet. Next one came and it was just as bad. Everyone was finished eating and I was so hungry so I ate it. Our server was mean and rude to boot. Way overpriced for food that is mediocre."}
{"text":"So I have dined here 12 x and haven't had a bad meal or experience yet. I could go through my favorite meals but there is no point it's great all around. Best part is the owner who still greats you, checks on your meal, and ensures you are welcome and happy.  Can't help it...app: lamb chop or underground chips. Steak salad, wild mushroom flatbread, pulled pork sandwich, all burgers, pork chop, steaks are ridiculous, and don't forget the sides of which the Brussels are the best !"}
{"text":"We've been to Parker's a bunch of times, so I'm not sure how it is that I've not yelped them before! But, nonetheless they showed up in my \"your next review awaits\" list and so despite my many visits, here's my first review: A+  

The food is awesome, though there is not a whole lot to choose from for those on a vegan diet (I was at the time, the first time I visited). Our service has always been fabulous, the patio is great considering it is a strip mall parking lot out there (they do a good job of helping you forget that) and the drinks and divine. The brussels sprouts have been my favorite side, so if you like the sprouts, order them up next time you're at Parkers!"}
{"text":"Went for a late night dinner. Server was very friendly. Ordered the calamari for an appetizer which was delicious. Also ordered the mussels which were very chewy and fishy tasting. The mushroom zucchini wrap was disappointing. The wrap was warm and the filling was cold. The manager offered to remake it warm but the 2nd was just as horrible as the original. The creme brûlée was decent."}
{"text":"Great deal at 5pm on Wednesday.  Mushroom/Brie flatbread app $5 and delish.  Burger special $5 (usually $10) ordered it
Med-rare...got it rare.  Handcut fries were good. Service was great except had to wait a while for my check.  Everything tasted good...got very busy quickly. Almost a 4 star but not there yet.
I'll be back to try again"}
{"text":"Ribs are great here!  Lamb chops listed as a starter are great as an entree too...add a few sides....smashed cauliflower I would recommend.  Our go to place!"}
{"text":"Impeccable! Starting with a cocktail, fantastic. Appetizers, Calamari, AWESOME, I read other reviews stating it was spicy, highly disagree as I would never have ordered it. The steak that was ordered as one entree was simply, Devine. The ribs, wow! The desert, ordered the lava cake, that was the only thing that was bad, talk about spice. But would NEVER take away the 5 star rating because of something that I choose to order. Server was great! Mixed up the food with our table, but again, 8 ppl, it's bound to happen. I have put it out on Facebook to go here to experience my now 2nd favorite restaurant."}

I was craving crab cakes and my hubby suggested Parkers. We had been there for a private event and the food looked good. 

I ordered the crab cake entree and the wedge salad. 

The wedge was on point- ingredients fresh and dressing (blue cheese) was delicious. It was a perfect wedge in my opinion. 

The low score goes to the crab cake entree (see pic for more info). For $21, I expected a nice entree. What I got was more of an appetizer than an entree- so price was very annoying to me. Regardless, the crab cakes were terrible. Not sure what kind of crab they were using but it had the consistency of tuna- but was very bland and the whole thing was just mushy. Not a chunk of crab and lots of filler. Very disappointing! Also, it wasn't cooked well. The broccoli slaw was quite good though. So there's that for an expensive entree...

Overall, if this was the meal I had, I wouldn't ever go back. Since it was carry out maybe I will give dining in a chance but not sure. I don't see why I wouldn't go to some of the other stellar restaurants close by. I love to support local restaurants and so wanted this to be a go to place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went with another couple last night.   We had reservations (thankfully) and we were seated in the back in a cozy booth.   The service was outstanding as the food was also wonderful.  I got the salmon and it was so fresh and delicious.  We loved this place and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and have been pleased on both visits. I have sat on patio both times. The outdoor seating is aa nice as can be for a restaurant in a strip mall with patio overlooking a parking lot. They do a nice job with placement of shrubs and foliage to obliterate the parking lot. 

The menu is varied American cuisine with some great choices and daily specials. Service is great with friendly staff. The steak salad is interesting as it is served over French fries. Burgers are good, but have to be eaten with a fork because of their height."}
