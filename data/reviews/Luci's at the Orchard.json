{"text":"BAD FOOD AND VERY BAD SERVICE.  CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS OVERHAULED.  Do NOT go here.  Poor food quality.  Rude service.  Not dog friendly, even if you had a tiny dog.     No shades.  Too bad they did not consult a landscape designer to transform the nursery to a comfortable place to hang."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today. Everything was delicious and fresh.  The ambiance is clean and cool. The staff was attentive and friendly. I can't wait to go back when it's cooler so we can sit outside."}
{"text":"I would rate Luci's restaurant 5 Stars but they missed the mark in 2 areas:  Exceeds Expectations *Food - 5 Stars *Kids Friendly - 6 Stars, best place for kids  *Ambiance and music - 5 Stars *Service - 5 Stars (restaurant staff)  Does not meet expectations  *Bathrooms - 2 Stars (there are not enough and the men's bathroom didn't smell great) *Cashiers - 1 Star (Cashiers at Luci's have the worst attitude. The last 2 times I have been there i have been unimpressed with their manners. They are young and don't know how to speak to adults )  Overall: 4 Stars Advice: Your restaurant has potential of being amazing... better cashiers would make a HUGE difference"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!! The coffee is amazing!Awesome place to come hang out with friends and family in the yard."}
{"text":"Great food, relaxed atmosphere, and an awesome community. The staff are always super-friendly. It is equally good for a long brunch, a quick drive through for coffee, or a working afternoon. Lingering is encouraged with their free wi-fi, outdoor areas, a splash pad for the kids."}
{"text":"Had such high expectations from all the recommendations I got to try this place. I must say that I didn't see what the hype was all about after my visit. We ordered the traditional breakfast and build your own omelet. For starters, the toast was burnt and the eggs weren't cook as ordered. The hash browns, eggs, and omelet needed some serious seasoning. I ordered bacon and ham in my omelet, but if they were there they were masters of disguise. The person that brought our food was helpful, but nothing to rave about. She got us non-burnt toast, scrambled eggs, and jelly. Nevertheless, we won't be returning anytime soon. For the price paid I expected more, could've got better tasting food somewhere else."}
{"text":"As someone who really loves Luci's, I want to give Luci's at the Orchard 4-5 stars.  However, the issue is that every time I have been there, usually mid-afternoon, there is always a group of parents with small children in the \"grassy\" area CHANGING DIRTY DIAPERS NEXT TO TABLES THAT PEOPLE ARE EATING AT.     As a healthcare professional, this is a SERIOUS health code violation for the exact same reason that dogs are not allowed at this restaurant.   This is an outdoor area set up with tables for people to eat at. The \"grassy\" area is not real grass but faux turf/green carpet making it an absolute BREEDING GROUND FOR BACTERIA.  There are lovely bathrooms with changing tables not 50 feet away from the grassy area.  Hopefully, Luci's management takes this seriously and gets this issue fixed before 1) they get shut down by the health department, or 2) someone gets sick."}
{"text":"Two out of two times I have been here I have been served inedible food and coffee and witnessed their manager be blatantly disrespectful to their guests. He practically publicly humiliated a mom outside and everyone that witnessed it was appalled. Customers are paying a premium for 2-star food. Also, their splash pad has a path right next to it that leads directly to the parking lot so be careful if you have a fast toddler with you."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere! Sandwiches was very good and the coffee was strong (which is a good thing)!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Luci's at the Orchard, great atmosphere and great food! I have been for breakfast and lunch and highly recommend both! The service is great and very attentive and they have plenty of outdoor seating to enjoy the beautiful weather and have misters on hotter days as well! They also have a small splash pad as well to keep the kiddos happy!"}
{"text":"This was one of the greatest breakfasts we've had. We are visiting from out of state for spring training and wanted a nice brunch spot and decided to try this place. IT WAS SO GOOD. Highly recommend the corned beef Benedict. Great little setting and both inside and outside seating available. Loved it."}
{"text":"Desperate for a strong coffee in Phoenix (Peets, are you listening?) until I found the red eye at Luci's: strong cup of coffee with a shot of espresso added. Bless you!"}
{"text":"It's finally here!!! We live within walking distance of The Orchard and frequent the original Luci's a few times a week, so needless to say we've been anxiously anticipating the opening. We've been to Pomelo and are looking forward to trying that again (great pizza, but we were there opening week and I think they were working some kinks out, will review when we go back). Official opening is 6/6, but you can go now. SO here's what you need to know about the new Luci's (assuming you are familiar with the OG):  1) There's the food/bev order station, a juice bar AND a bar (order only, Pomelo has the sit down bar). You no longer have to stand in the main line to order a coffee! They finally have a separate menu for their full range of non-alcoholic drinks and flavors which is AWESOME because I knew there were gems I hadn't tried yet. Watermelon Green Tea is my new Summer jam. The Bloody Mary's are INSANELY good.  2) The food menu is different! I, like you, was wondering how they were going to pull off two Luci's within a mile of each other. Well, they did it!!! Gone are the burrito bomb (RIP for my husband, you'll have to make the extra 3 minute journey if you're really craving it) and Turkey Lurkey, replaced with equally (maybe even more) appetizing Carne Asada burrito and Turkey Melt. We also got the Grinder (looks fabulous), Natural Flavor Burger (in the running for best new burger in Phoenix?), Kid's Chicken Strips (we need to talk about how perfect these fries are), and the Tuna and Fig Wrap for me (more tuna, less greens, and fig pieces in the jam would take this from good to great). I am so excited to explore the menu and find my new favorites. See picture for full menu.  3) The GOODS. Okay, bye bye LGO, cute boutiques, and Luci's OG. They've taken it to the next level with merchandise. This has more consumer products than grocery, but there is an abundance of Danzeisen milk (cow love emojis) in every flavor and size. We're talking gorgeous and unique home styling, bath, gifts, and every day use products. Swell water bottles, Coola sunscreen, stylish mosquito repellent bracelets (yes, I own that statement), blinged out pepper spray, cute kid's gifts. I'm not doing it justice. You'll see.  4) Vibe and decor. SPLASH PAD that you can take an assortment of adult beverages from all 3 restaurants to. We went out to a table in the middle of the orchard on the grass in Phoenix's first 117 day. The umbrella and misters did their job! The baby LOVES the splash pad. Ample seating inside and out (thank goodness ). I love the original elements (fireplace) inside building 2, rocking chairs, spacious layout and I won't go too much more into the overall vibe of The Orchard because this place is now MINE and you don't have to frequent it in order for it to stay in business... I think I'll be keeping it afloat single-handedly. :)  Update: tried the Chilaquiles today and they are SO good! Also, tried the gelato from Splurge. I'm going to wait until they are fully up and running before I review. Initial impressions are that the gelato is in test stages :( - the flavors (green tea and salted caramel) were off and too sugary. Plus, $4 for a single scoop doesn't seem like the right price point considering each add'l scoop is $1. I don't want to be penalized for getting a single scoop. It does, however, promote sharing. Hoping they add affogato/coffee/float options and ready for the adult selections!"}
{"text":"One of the best casual restaurant environments in metro Phoenix only partially compensates for below average eats. Ordered their chicken salad. Much inferior to a McDonald's which I consider better than average. Long waiting lines and full parking lot will eventually not be problem if they stay this course."}
{"text":"I had a toddler birthday party here for my daughter back in May.  I like their splash pad and wanted something where the little ones could have fun but not too large and overwhelming.  The Orchard was great.  We corresponded with Linda, the events coordinator, and she put together a nice little package just to fit our group.  We rented the barn space between Luci's and Pomelo's and the kids had a blast running between the grassy area and the splash pad. Every child received a coupon for splurge and was able to choose their own scoop of ice cream.  Best added perk was the guitarist who plays on sundays - she graciously volunteered to play/sing happy birthday to my 3 yo.  It was a perfect day and if you are looking for a place to throw an outdoor group event, this place is ideal."}
{"text":"This place is so cute and very relaxing and peaceful! I went here to study and get some work done and it was a nice atmosphere. Friendly staff! I got an iced vanilla latte and it was delicious. A little pricey compared to other coffee shops I've been to in Phoenix but worth it nonetheless! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The new Luci's is beautiful! Great space for big groups or if you just want to hang out and work remotely. The food is incredible too!"}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have a place like this open in our neighborhood. Great food and great place to come hangout with the kids. They have fantastic outdoor area with nice little splash pad and seating areas with misters. Ice cream is amazing. Love it here. Only bummer is that the splash pad closes at 6 on weekends, but stays open until 8 on weekdays."}
{"text":"Leaving Luci's because there are ZERO vegan options! Get with the program Luci's... so bummed :("}
{"text":"Was watching the morning news on 3 as they highlighted this new place. Decided to make the long trek from north valley to try it out. I must say it was worth the trip. You order from a counter with attentive service from the help. Line was long but moved quickly and along the line you are able to shop for trinkets you probably won't even need. I order the chilaquiles which were awesome. Tender shredded chicken in a tomatillo square over soft corn tortillas and chunky guacamole with your choice of eggs on top. I highly recommend it! My husband had the French toast which was average. Great atmosphere and nice complex for walking around."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came here for brunch. It was our first time and we absolutely LOVED everything about this place. It is so cute, is next to an ice cream shop, the food is amazing, kid friendly, and overall AMAZING! I ordered the Rueben Stack (it was, AMAZING!) Also, the place is named Luci's, it was only appropriate to brunch here."}
{"text":"The sandwich was light on the meat, but still tasted good. The French fries were really tasty. Nice and crispy."}
{"text":"Such a darling venue. We had high hopes that this could become our go to breakfast place. Sadly, our first visit was not great.   I asked if it was possible to turn the fans down or off because they were blowing pretty cold on our table (my coffee was cold in minutes). The gentleman said he would check. He then came back and said they can't be turned off. So they're on or off and before I could ask for off, he was gone.   My meal then came and it looked  great, however once I dug in, I found the avocado was completely brown. So I picked them out expecting someone to come and check on our food but that never happened. When he finally came to clear the dirty dishes I pointed out the mushy avocado and he said oh I'll let the kitchen know. No apology, not even a concern. Someone with no people skills should likely not be the face of your restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible experience over the holidays at Luci's at the Orchard and also the location at 16 th St and Bethany. I purchased $100 in gift cards and received a $20 bonus gift card. YAY!!  Not so fast,  to make a very long story short, the gift cards had $0 on them. I gave one for a gift, how embarrassing!  The whole situation trying to resolve the error took over 6 weeks and 5 trips to Luci's  and remains not fully resolved. I received $70 in gift cards!  They stole from me. No compensation for the inconvenience and no apologies for their errors. It sickens me to even think I would go back there.  So much for supporting a small business in my neighborhood.  I"}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars to this place because: 1. Very close to my house  2. Great atmosphere inside and outside 3. Great customer service 4. I can bring my dogs here by the front patio just to chill and have my dirty chai  I have not tried their food yet. And I am not sure if I will try their food any time soon only because I am a pretty picky vegetarian/vegan foodie. I just love the relaxing and comfortable vibe. Pet-friendly front area is definitely a huge plus for me to keep bring back my dogs here."}
{"text":"Being a fan of Luci's at 16th and Bethany I really hate to put this place down but the last two visits have been way below expectations. Lunch a week ago was just OK as far as the food but we attempted to eat on the back patio near the kiddie fountain and were overcome by flies!! It was gross. Note to Luci, Bottle Trees or plastic bags with water in them. (It works look it up)  Went again for brunch today. More flies though not as bad as a week ago. Breakfast was tasteless. The Carmel Almond Fruit tea and the Smuckers jam were the highlights of the visit.  Not sure whats wrong here but it definitely needs work before I will be returning."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe with trinkets and doodads for sale on the side. Very cool location, a converted nursery that now houses a couple of restaurants and shops in a quiet neighborhood setting. Solid breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning-lots of kids everywhere. Very cute set up with lawn chairs, grassy lawns, and flowers. Great vegetarian options. We didn't like the long line to order. And unless you have kids or are okay being surrounded by them when you eat maybe pick a different spot. Great place for families though."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast or lunch in Phoenix. Clean, simple, tasty food. The only annoying thing is staff needs to chill out on sucking up and focus on server basics like... Utensils. Water. Napkins. Menus. That's all."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Luci's was for breakfast. The experience was wonderful. The Batistas were on the ball! You could tell that they really were happy to have you there.  Service was offered with a flair! The food was delicious and gluten free. However, yesterday afternoon I stopped by with a friend who had recently moved to Phoenix.  I had told her Luci's was a great place it to eat. The place has character. Anyway, the Batista seemed like she was shocked that I had came in. Sort of hesitated to take my order.  One of the girls dropped a lid of a pot when I was ordering. Yeah, so that was my second visit to Luci's. It was a little different than my first experience. The food was still delicious! I will try it again"}
{"text":"Luci's at the Orchard is fabulous!!  The food great just like the flagship on Bethany and 16th Street.   Gelato, coffee and Happy Hour!  The outdoor space is spectacular"}
{"text":"Orders GF French toast, 2 scrambled eggs and coffee for $15. Very filling and yummy breakfast. Awesome to sit in the courtyard and relax"}
{"text":"I gotta be honest, there's nothing food-wise on their menu that I crave. No dish that I can't wait to go back for, but their food is fresh and clean. The ambiance and environment is tip top, and here's the best part, their 'chai' is a syrup. Add that to your Americano, no cream, VERY good, best in town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for coffee or lunch. Love the menu and drinks. They have a great outdoor patio and indoor fireplace too.  I really enjoy stopping for coffee."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed in the new place.  The setting is perfect and sets up this feeling for an amazing experience, then you get your food.  I have eaten at the original location many times and have always had great food.  I think this is a classic situation where the company has grown and something had to be sacrificed (quality).  Our party had three people in it and we ordered different items.  Veggie burger, rueben, and the courtyard club.  All warm food was cold and the club was poorly built with stale bread (bacon was amazing).  The sides were fruit, frys (cold and greasy),and potato salad  (very good).  For the history I have with this place i just would expect better.  Manager was not helpful, had no answer other than he would check on the kitchen staff.  Hopefully he does so your meal will be acceptable."}
{"text":"I when to the restaurant and I liked it.the atmosphere was great food was excellent I really love it and I will recommend it Good job luci"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a morning outing with your toddler. They have a nice patio area with a splash pad for the little ones. The patio is partially shaded by trees which makes it bearable with our intense hot weather. We had a yogurt parfait and an oatmeal which were good. I'm a serious latte drinker and it was okay. I gave it four stars for ambiance (especially a place for my kiddo to enjoy) and food. Wish this place was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"A great setting!  Delightful inside and out, with plenty of room and parking;  easy access in a residential area.  Excellent food and coffee.  Great concept.  Can you build one closer to my neighborhood?"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and staff. Went for breakfast and came back the next day!! Drinks available, great outdoor seating, cool merchandise for sale. Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere indoors & out! Darling gift shop and ice cream shop.  VERY pricey for some of the same food & beverage you get in this town!  A luncheon club sandwich w/fries, a dessert & tea was over $28! That's quite spendy for this community. It's a great place, food was nice but typical. But at those lunch prices it will not be a regular stop it's more of a special occasion stop for a $30 plus tip lunch. For $30 you could go the The Henry or Hillstone."}
{"text":"Wow. Sorry for not knowing what your menu items are exactly. Not like you have a sign for the drive thru. Thanks for the yummy coffee Michelle. You were not friendly or inviting at all. I went off the name on the receipt because you didn't give me one. Had a feeling you were the manager because you are of a more mature stature but you definitely didn't present yourself as someone who likes what your doing. Hope your day gets better. Like that Luci's  is down the street from me but will be going to Dutch bros from now on."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to Luci's and I have to say they are very friendly. However, I didn't order food because the food in the display case looked terrible. See picture of dried out curled up quiche. Would anyone want to eat that? it looks like garbage to me. When the counter person asked if we wanted to order food I said, \"I did until I saw the quiche in the display case, you should look at it\" She responded, \"Yah, it's great\". She didn't even look at it. Then, we were overcharged for two small coffees total $9.60? Really, Starbucks is cheaper and that wasn't even the posted price so I was overcharged by at least $1.35. Sorry Luci's, that was a big fail."}
{"text":"The food was about par, but a little pricey. I was charged 50¢ extra for a little butter for my bagel and an extra $1 for strawberry flavor for my lemonade. $11 for a lemonade and bagel doesn't make me want to return for a full meal."}
{"text":"Our family loves the new edition to our neighborhood! It's great for us parents & for our two little girls who love the splash pad! My only request is that you bring over the Croquet Ham Madam from your 16th and Bethany local!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food and the service is amazing. Perfect spot for brunch with your girlfriends or mom. They have something on the menu for everyone. Everything was very fresh and cooked to perfection. They have a great selection of beverages including alcoholic and non- alcoholic drinks. I had the biscuits and gravy along with a Bloody Mary, I enjoyed both. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been to Lucis several times but today was not a great experience.  1.   Stood in line from the door because they were only running 1 cashier.  2.  Couldn't find the paper menus because by the time you get to the cashier you can't see the menus. 3.  Ordered the special sammie and it was $10.49, one of the most expensive items on the menu.  It literally was the most over priced item and lacked value. No side of any kind compared to other menu items it was a huge disappointment especially at Luke warm temperature.  4.  Traditional breakfast, eggs cold and potatoes luke warm at best."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love the new location, and was willing to put previous poor food and service at the original location aside. While the concept is lovely, the omelette was awful. The applewood smoked bacon was so over cooked, I was unable to stick my fork in it. Overall, the omelette was slightly burnt. I hope they can fix this issue!"}
{"text":"Now that I've been here 3 times (twice on consecutive weekends, no less) it's time to add my two cents.  As someone else mentioned, I'm not sure I would have found this place had a friend not mentioned it.  I'm REALLY liking Luci's, from the moment a buddy and I rode our motorcycles here on opening day to this morning's visit with my best friend. Luci's  comprises one of three establishments surrounding a beautiful little courtyard shared by all ( it will be really ideal come the cooler weather! ). Inside the shop are various things to purchase, from knickknacks, jewelry, sundry food items, etc.   I've only come for breakfast so far, but I'm sure the other items are just as tasty. The Morning Run Burrito this morning was just perfect: sautéed kale, black bean mix, sautéed peppers, Swiss cheese and egg whites (I'm quoting from the menu here) in whole wheat tortilla, with a side of salsa. Just delicious. On my previous two early morning visits I chose the Egg sandwich on an \"everything\" bagel with bacon. You can choose from a variety of cheeses and meat to put in, according to your tastes. It's now a favorite of mine. The coffee is also really tasty. I've enjoyed the Americano and a simple regular coffee. Each time it's been a treat.  As you'd expect there's a generous selection of cream, non-dairy, sweeteners and such to flavor to your taste or not, as well as bottles of Cholula or tabasco sauce to spice up your meal should you so choose  The restaurant is laid out in a basic \"L\" shape with plenty of seating as well as a few countertop settings, all of which offer a nice view of the courtyard, which also offers a good amount of seating, trees, grass and even a little splash pad that kids can frolic in.   Service has been great each time as well. Food is ordered at the counter and if you want a coffee or drink it's given to you almost before you're done paying. You take a number to your table and in short order your food is brought to you. I seriously don't think I've waited much more than 5 minutes from the time I've sat down to receiving my food. The staff is very friendly, easy with a smile, courteous and seem pleased that you've stopped by.   Overall, Luci's at the Orchard is just a great place. It's definitely earned a high spot on my regular \"rotation\" of motorcycle meal destinations. I bring a good book, or a good friend and enjoy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came to this place for the first time recently and I love it! I love the outdoor space - so green, friendly and inviting. It was fun to shop all the knickknacks while I waited for my friend. The baked treats look amazing, though I haven't tried them yet.  But, not exaggerating, the iced chai tea I got was one of the best I've ever had, because it wasn't too sweet! Instead it was just really flavorful and a little sweet. Perfection.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago and it was an awesome surprise! The food...I inhaled it. Vaporized it. It's great for family and they have fountains the kiddos can splash and play in. Highly recommend and be ready to be surprised. It really is nicely done!"}
{"text":"It's a Cracker Barrel for hipsters (my daughter actually came up with that, but it's such a great line that I have to repeat it!). Tasty food, inviting garden seating, nifty stuff in the gift shop area - what's not to like? Rather on the spendy side, but perfect for all the young, with-it urban parents, and their adorable toddlers (see: splash pool)."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Beautiful patio. Awesome Sunday spot . I loved The Orchid Juice. Amazing cold brew! Definitely coming back .."}
{"text":"We came late morning and decided to try lunch. I love enjoy their chai and other teas, but the food experience was a miss. I ordered a chef salad type entree, and I couldn't eat much of it. The bacon on top was chewy, creeped me out, and the salad had been just doused in a ranch dressing. It was legit soaking! We also tried what I felt was a lackluster burger which seemed like a dish to try judging their other reviews on the same."}
{"text":"great atmosphere outside.  heaters are only for night so i think it would be nice if they were available if someone asked.  FANTASTIC corned beef eggs benedict.  a bit crowded inside but this store has so many things to buy.  it'd take a day just to look at it all.  pet friendly outside :) it's self serve which is a bit unusual as you have to find your table first then order.  they bring it out to you but saving a seat can be tricky.  any alcohol has to be purchased across the way at their other restaurant."}
{"text":"So cute - very similar to LGO grocery layout. Food was decent and service was on point. Really just a wonderful place to grab brunch or breakfast with some gal pals."}
{"text":"Hey hey hey AZ this gem is a must try ,tucked away in a quant little  neighborhood , one owner three great places on the same property .  Brunch was fantastic everything is made fresh and it is gluten friendly . Dress is casual , prices affordable , heads up , it's busy and they don't take reservations . Definitely  worth the try ! As always ,if you go let me know and enjoy"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! I've been wanting to come here for awhile now and finally had the opportunity this morning. Gorgeous patio area and very kid friendly. We brought our 23 month old. I wish we had known to pack a bathing suit because of the water sprinklers. So if you have small children make sure to bring them! We will know for next time. Such a perfect place for breakfast/lunch or dinner. I had the frittata and would recommend that to anyone. Everything looked delicious though. Truly think you couldn't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"What a delightful place ... beautiful venue ... beet salad was delicious and fresh, and solicitous service (without being fawning).  Separate ice cream and candy shack that we didn't try, but that looked excellent.  Will be back for brunch soon."}
{"text":"Took a friend who had always wanted to go.  Very disorganized upon walking in.  Took a few minutes to figure out you had to order food in the same line people were ordering coffee.  Online menu is convenient but not up to date on prices.  I ordered the Traditional Breakfast which included toast.  I was asked if I would like a homemade English muffin instead of toast and I said sure.  After the fact, I was very surprised that I was charged an additional fee for the muffin.   I should have been told when ordering.  After we finished eating, I thought about asking for a refund but the line was so long and we didn't have time to wait.  Food was prepared well but with too much salt, not a heart smart endorsed eatery.  Meals are also large enough for two people to share or for one person to save half for later.  Would prefer smaller meals and lower prices.  I probably will not go back for 3 reasons.  Charged for something that said was included in the meal, meals too large consequently making the prices too large and the noise inside and out makes it difficult to carry on a pleasant conversation.  Overall not a comfortable place to eat."}
{"text":"I wish this place was so much more than it is. I was excited when they opened up not too far from where we live. I have three kids and thought it would be the perfect play date meet up spot to get drinks and food and let the kids run around a bit. However, it's not as kid friendly as I'd like. The splash pad in tiny, like twice the size of a double shower. The kids still enjoy it but it can get crowded and then the kids get bored. The staff is hit and miss with their friendliness. Some days we get great customer service, but many times I've felt a bit unwelcome. Such a shame since it's close to us, we always buy drinks and food and invite friends to meet us there who also spend money."}
{"text":"This is a must see place!  It's like a little compound with lots of outdoor seating and exceptionally yummy food!  I love Luci's on 16th Street too but this new Luci's is over the top!"}
{"text":"*Almost* cannot even focus on the menu when I walked into the store. Everything is so quaint and adorable and there's so much to look at!  What made it even harder was my toddler son who had the same problem as I did; he wanted to touch everything!  Anyhow- we needed food and chose the kids meal chicken and the reg menu crispy chicken sandwhich.  Both were delicious and I really wanted to snag a picture of my plate...... but I was too hungry and forgot.  Paid about $18 for our meals and it took everything in me to pass up the giant cookies that were sitting in the display case. But I will not pass it up next time!"}
{"text":"Great garden patio, but the lack of fresh orange & grapefruit juice (while there are masses of other fresh juices!) is disappointing.  Food is okay, & service is pleasant.   The unavailability of printed menus is annoying ~ you have to look way up at the menu board, which is hard to read."}
{"text":"My friends and I found this place due to it being the same spelling as my friend's name. So we came not knowing what to expect. The whole place is absolutely beautiful! It's coffee house meets family meets restaurant. I got the Reuben stack with a side of fries. The cashier said to get the fries because they have \"pretty good fries.\" I shrugged because everyoneeeee thinks they have good fries. I got them anyways and she was NOT kidding. Such good fries!! Their banana nut muffin is amazing as well. Overall- food was amazing. The cashier was so helpful, kind, and bright. I live in the east valley... and this is a no brained that I will gladly make a 45+ minute drive to eat here again."}
{"text":"We had an éclair and some other pastries here. The ambiance of the cafe and store is super cute. I bought a 3D greeting card for my grandma here. I also bought quite a few Homeboys jalapeño hot sauces from the youtube show Hot Ones where they do interviews while eating increasingly spicy hot wings.  I could have sworn that the price displayed was less than what I paid for but I was distracted at the checkout talking with my friend. I would recommend getting the chipotle hot sauce instead of the  jalapeño. I think it's more flavorful, plus it's the one they use on the show. They carry all sorts of knick knacks which would make good gifts. I think there were some locally produced products available. I would love it if they made locally made products a little more obvious. The jewelry was cute, but not my style.   We dined at the next door Pomelo (pizza and such) before heading over here. Combined, it's an adorable Phoenix venue. I could see someone holding a wedding or big party here.   The cashier and pastry case employees could have been more friendly. It was near closing time, but we didn't linger."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast and lunch. Great food and drinks. Cute garden courtyard with misters and a splash pad for the kids."}
{"text":"I am super sad about doing his review because I had better expectations and hopes. I've now come to Luci's Orchard three times and will probably go back, however not for any cooked meals.    Got the Champagne Berry Crepes and they just were not tasty. I don't know if cooks aren't allowed to use new pans because of how quickly orders are coming out or what!? But my crepes tasted like they were cooked in a dirty pan, with a taste of like bacon/ham. Also, they were over cooked and crunchy.   Another occasion I got the Orchard omelette which also has no meat but again tasted like a dirty pan or oil was re-used. I try to go vegetarian sometimes and or reduce meat intake and using old oil or dirty pans is a no no! Contaminating food like this is not ok.  Prices are extremely high for the quality of food that is being served. I can't say I've had a better experience at Luci's on 16th street. I absolutely love the markets and cool items to buy inside both markets but the kitchens need some help! Customer service also does a great job. Maybe I'll stick to juices"}
{"text":"My wife and I were on a stay-cation and she suggested we give Luci's a try. A unique setup - where you order at the inside counter/store and can sit inside or outside in a open courtyard. The courtyard atmosphere was friendly and awesome! We loved relaxing outside in the sun, chatting and waiting for our meal. This is a great place for a casual date, friends, or even bring the kids!  The food was great! We both opted for a late breakfast - some biscuits n gravy and a corned beef eggs benedict. Fantastic! Every item on the menu looked great and we are excited to come back and try something new! A locally sourced/farm-to-table concept at its best. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The staff was immediately attentive and helpful with a recommendation for my breakfast choice.  The entire restaurant, inside and out, was impeccably clean.  Their coffee has a very full flavor profile which complimented my Orchard omelette, to which I added chicken breast.  The meal was incredibly delicious.  I recommend Luci's to anyone looking for a delicious meal in a casual, family friendly, dining environment."}
{"text":"It's hard for me to write this review because they have great food and the place is super cute but I was treated pretty crappily by what seemed like a manager. I brought my two dogs with me because I called ahead of time to see if they had a dog friendly patio and they do. I had my boyfriend watch the dogs while I went in and ordered our food. After ordering I grabbed a cup of water for the dogs and took a seat outside. When I got outside I put the cup of water on the ground for my beagle and placed my 4 pound chihuahua in my lap so she wouldn't walk around and bother other guests. As my beagle was drinking water and my chihuahua (whose name is Lucy, mind you. Part of the reason I chose the restaurant) was sitting on my lap a middle aged gentleman came out to give us our mimosas and scolded me for having my chihuahua on my lap telling me to set her on the ground then also commenting on how they have a water bowl on the property for the dogs (the bowl was sitting next to two women and their dog, didn't wanna barge into their meal to get my dog a drink). This gentleman didn't say any of this in a nice tone though he was being rude, almost scoffing and us. I won't be returning and it's a shame because it is a nice place."}
{"text":"What can I say that others haven't?  Super sweet place that I will definitely go back to.  Of course, we went very early on a weekend, so I'm not sure how crowded or trendy this is.  Only drawback is that it's kind of pricey - especially the coffees.  I've bought myself a lot of iced mochas and this was the most I've ever paid.  The iced brew wasn't much cheaper."}
{"text":"Long line, but moved quickly. We stopped here because I was determined to find gluten free french toast during our trip to Phoenix. Was not disappointed! Cute location, delicious food, beautiful weather. My family got a yogurt parfait, breakfast burrito, corned beef eggs Benedict, breakfast Sammie, and the GF french toast. The parfait, burrito and french toast were perfect. The Sammie and Benedict proved cumbersome to eat, though they reported still tasty. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Lucis at the Orchard is a great little neighborhood go-to place.  I find myself wanting to go back but I recommend if you like peace and quiet, your best bet is to go during the middle of the week.  If you go on the weekend, I hope you like kids because the outdoor seating area is flooded with them  running around and parents chasing them.  At times, this can be a bit distracting to those whom don't have kids and want a peaceful meal.   I find the place to be very quaint and inviting.  Except when its crowded which takes away the ambiance due to noise and chaos.  The food is OK.  For folks with stomach issues, just a heads up - The sandwiches and menu items contain lots of seeds.  We had an issue ordering a plain turkey sandwich for my elderly mom who has a stomach issue where she cannot eat seeds.  We were told the bread for her sandwich would not contain seeds but it did.  We sent it back and it came on plain white bread but with seeds in the raspberry mayonnaise.     I find myself wanting to go back and try the burger which is nicely sized but often tastes \"bland.\"  However, I do recommend the Corned Beef Benedict or Reuben stack which is  Delicious.  If you choose to go for these items, ensure you are going early because i have been twice and they have run out of Corned Beef by around 1:00 -  2:00 pm. All in all, i would go back to Lucy's on work from home days where i can go in the middle of the week and it is less crowded.  I found it to be hit or miss, but this place is actually too cute to stop going to."}
{"text":"Just had a great lunch with my wife. We each had a salad and both were delicious. Great setting and can't wait to come back some evening after the weather breaks for some pizza and drinks. Our waitress Monica was great with service and drink refills. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We've ordered burrito bombs and had uber eats deliver. Each time, I specifically say NO potatoes - how difficult is that - they still put potatoes in - ruined it for us every time. Never again will we order from there!"}
{"text":"I love going here to eat with my daughter so she can play outside. The splash pad is fun! The young people working the counter can be a bit short and seem annoyed at times, but other than that, the service is great. If they lowered their drive thru coffee to match dutch brothers I would go there instead for my morning latte. They are currently at least one dollar more."}
{"text":"Luci's at the Orchard was outstanding! The staff was amazing, coffee to die for, and atmosphere very welcoming. Although it is hotter than heck out right now the outside seating area is perfect to enjoy cocktails with girlfriends or some coffee. I cannot wait to go back and try their food! 2 thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"My 87 year old mother (who's lived in tropical paradise most of her life until now) and I love, love, love coming here on Saturday afternoons to eat, drink, and enjoy the orchard!! We always order burgers and soup and green tea.  Mom loved the coffee ice cream and last time, we bought cool socks for her.  The staff is super nice and the long line moves fast so don't worry! Thank you, Luci's, for making a little slice of treed, balmy heaven available in Phoenix.  There's a wide mix of people and ages and vibe here so there's a place for everyone and no stress or pressure.  Relax!"}
{"text":"Brunch is fantastic! Food is really good...I like the burrito bomb..but the atmostphere is a 10. Cute little green space. Outdoor seating...a little sanctuary in Uptown. My favorite saturday spot."}
{"text":"What a great place! The atmosphere is great both inside and out. Try to go at the least busiest times as the place gets unbelievably packed making it hard to park and find a place to eat. Having only been there once, I cannot give advice on what times are best, but I can tell you that 11 am on a Sunday is busy! Next time I will probably try 8:00-8:30 am to beat the brunch crowd.   Feel fee to bring the kids to play on splash pad, grassy area and share some ice cream, which looked delicious. There is a fresh lemonade stand and I noticed that a kinds Birthday party was going on while we were there. I will add a caveat, if you are a person that does not have toleration for children this place may be difficult for you. Because of the great amenities that I mentioned above there are a lot children here.   In regards to food and beverage selection, there is way more than I thought there would be. The green tea was delicious and they have a nice array adult beverages as well as coffee choices. The food was great and since I am a picky eater they were super accommodating.  Overall, awesome place! I will just try to find a less busy time to go."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here on opening day and it was such a delight. The food, the service, the views, the atmosphere - everything was great. More spacious than the original Luci's on Bethany Home and 16th Street and with definitely more parking (a challenge in the original establishment). The menu is different at this new location but you can still find some of the favorite items from the original Luci's. Also, there is a lot of outdoor patio seating and very nice views of the green space in the middle of the Orchard complex.  Prices are really good, many colorful gift items are for sale, and WiFi is available."}
{"text":"Brought friends last Sunday and we loved the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the food did not fair well. My fig and tuna wrap lacked any fig flavor. My friend had a Kale and chicken salad. Kale was delicious, but the chicken was bone choking dry. And finally my other friend ordered a breakfast omelette which she said lacked flavor and the potatoes that came with equally flavorless and mushy. Truly, a disappointment considering how pretty the place was and that it was busy."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten a meal here. I go here specifically for their coffees and teas. Absolutely delicious! The Toddy cold brew is amazing. I always get their Dirty Chi Latte on ice, simply delicious! I've recommended this place to a few people, and a couple of coworkers already go here. I'm glad I accidentally went to this place. It was the best decision I made."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Have come here twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner and haven't been disappointed!"}
{"text":"What is more dangerous than brunch? Being able to shop for gifts and wine at Brunch. I love love love Luci's. I have to say that it took way too long for me to finally make my way over, but it was worth the wait. The employee's are incredibly knowledgeable about the menu from the coffee to the food being served. I absolutely love that you can substitute avocado for meat at breakfast. Little things like that definitely set them apart. This is a great place to meet up with a friend or family, though it can get a little too noisy with children."}
{"text":"Held my daughters bridal shower here. Everyone said it was beautiful. The food was awesome (French toast, breakfast burritos, fresh fruit, lemon scones, blueberry and banana nut muffins all to die for) and the adult beverages were very good. The two person hostess staff were very attentive, taking care of all guests requests and we had 34 guests so they had their hands full. Linda was very accommodating helping to coordinate decor and party rental companies. There were two cons: Linda called me on these two items practically after hitting send. She let me know they were on top of one of the items and I realized the other item was an oversight on my part. So impressed with how Luci's handled every facet of this event from booking, the actual event, and now even my review. I'm even more impressed."}
{"text":"Mocha good but not standing and waiting 10 minutes for it. Long lines, not enough help.  Staff  were friendly but long conversation with clients made a slow transition for guests. Poor process."}
{"text":"This is an enjoyable place to visit and sit outside in their grass and tree covered courtyards. Young moms gather in the mornings w toddlers around the fountains and sometimes a bird in a tree drops their former meal right on your head--plop! It's a real orchard!!! Kidding aside, there is an extensive breakfast menu. I like their egg dishes and even their yogurt parfait. There are yummy muffins and a terrific array of Italian ice creams--what do you call it? Yikes...the name escapes me right now, you know what I mean. Don't you?"}
{"text":"I had not yet been to Luci's Marketplace despite its ascendant popularity with the CenPho crowd since it first opened in 2009.  I was also not aware that Luci's had opened a second location just up the road.  And I was positively stunned when I found out where Luci's second location was built.  I grew up just a 5 minute drive from what used to be an old home with a fruit orchard on premises on 12th Street just north of Glendale.  The old adobe home is still on premises, but the property has otherwise been beautifully transformed.  Invited to join my family for brunch here on a Sunday, I arrived dazzled by the aesthetics, hoping the food would be equally enchanting.  If you were to do a mashup of LGO Hospitality's La Grange Orange, Upward Projects' Churn, and Fox Restaurant Concepts' The Yard, chances are you'd come up with something resembling The Orchard.  You can credit owners Lucia and Ken Schnitzer of Luci's Urban Concepts for transforming what was once a simple adobe home and fruit orchard into a complex of restaurants with an outdoor seating and entertainment area to match.  The Schnitzers have done a fantastic job of preserving and rehabbing the old adobe home on the property (now the Pomelo's space) as well as add a breakfast, lunch, and dessert space next door (Luci's and Splurge Ice Cream).  The outdoor seating area is a mix of shaded seating in the center with trees, grass, artificial turf, and even a splash pad lining the perimeter.  Plenty of seating for big groups with picnic tables, tables and chairs, or even on the brick walls lining the property.  Super family friendly and super dog friendly as well.  A perfect setup for the numerous Madison School District families that occupy the neighborhood.  I'm sure I'll give Pomelo and Splurge a whirl at some point, but today it was all about Luci's.  The Luci's space most resembles LGO due in part to all the knick knacks and collectibles you can purchase whilst waiting in line to get in your food order.  Order at the counter here, grab a number and they bring it out to you (whether you choose to sit on premises).  As this is a breakfast and lunch spot and I was right on the brunch hour (10am to be exact), I went with separate breakfast and lunch items.  For breakfast, their cranberry orange muffins looked heavenly (and huge) so I grabbed one of those.  Additionally I ordered a Luci's Burger.  A half-pound burger with greens, red onion, tomato, applewood smoked bacon, and cheddar cheese on a brioche bun.  Also got a side of fresh fruit.  Total cost for the food including tax came out just under $20.  Food came out in just over 5 minutes (despite a pretty full crowd).  The muffin was excellent, mixing in a little tart acidity of the dried fruits and smooth texture of the muffin cake itself.  The burger was also quite good, though I wouldn't say it blew me away.  True, sometimes a burger is just a burger, but it can also sometimes be magnificent (i.e. The Stand or The Parlor).  Luci's Burger is good, but not yet in the realm of magnificent.  Still, a tasty meal in a beautiful outdoor space.  Thusfar a good first impression from Lucia and Ken.  I'm eager to check out their flagship restaurant on 16th Street and Bethany Home as well as to try out Pomelo and Splurge next time I'm here at the Orchard.  It continues to amaze me how so much of my old neighborhood has been preserved, transformed and repurposed.  And for the most part, its local restauranteurs who are leading the charge with mostly positive results.  The Orchard is unquestionably built to last for generations of families in CenPho looking for a tasty, comfortable respite close to home.  The Schnitzers saw the property's potential and most certainly realized it.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my friend.. line was ridiculously long but moved quickly. Which was great. Loved the cute set up inside and out. Lots of seating area outside and the day was amazing. Couldn't decide on what to order but went for some hotcakes and chilaquiles. Hotcakes were amazing and buttery. Chilaquiles.. the green chili sauce was bland and avocado old. My friend ordered corned beef and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and was impressed! Excellent selection on the menu and the food was excellent! ! Had the Orchard omelet, it was yummmmmmy! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"We were anxious to check out the Orchard since it recently opened and it certainly did not disappoint!  I love the original Luci's location, so assumed this one would be just as good...and it sure is!  The staff was very friendly, they have a nice drink and food menu and great seating options both inside and out.  We ordered the club, turkey sandwich and the Oasis juice.  Everything was absolutely delicious!  The fresh juice was quite pricey, but so worth it."}
{"text":"Very tasty and the misters make it very nice on the patio. The food is very good but prices a little high for a burger."}
{"text":"Great 2nd location with a similar vibe but in the middle of the great new Orchard area.  Pomelo is across the way, Splurge ice cream is here.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Oh, and yeah, and there was food here too. It was ok. Prepared well, but expected & redundant as all breakfast places taste the same?   Went here for our Vote For Americas Apocalypse 2016 Election breakfast.   For me it was nothing to write home about since most Breakfast places seem to copy each other's menu like flunkies in school who didn't study for a test.   The word \"Healthy\" in the menu translates to higher prices at Luci's because, hey, Marketing.   The saving grace was The Orchards patio itself. Weathers nice, so get out and enjoy it while you can.   So really this non-review, review is like a 3 & 1/2 star kinda thing."}
{"text":"My good friend Sam and I went here for lunch. Service couldn't have been better. The food was delicious. The surroundings were exceptional. Sam knows the best places to lunch. Must go back and try more of their large menu. The calamari was a perfect started. Sam got a turkey sandwich and I had a salad. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"The Orchard is a nice place to sit outside and enjoy the weather. Luci on the other hand is pricey for a glob of yogurt. I ordered the Birchermuesll Moose which was suppose to be a bowl of Muesli with yogurt.  There must have been a tablespoon of Muesli and the rest yogurt in a small cup.  Choice of tea...black or green.  And why does it advertise itself as a gourmet market and cafe?  Nothing gourmet about it.  So many other similar places in the valley who do a much better."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Great atmosphere- and the food was really good.  We had the veggie frittata and the chopped Cobb salad.  Both very tasty- only issue was chicken a bit on the dry side.  Drinks were great- can't wait to go back!  Do yourself a favor and go to The Orchard- we need more of this type of place!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the coolest places I've been to to grab breakfast. Extremely inviting, awesome outside siting..this place is vibing! Delicious breakfast and friendly staff..will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Luci's has become our go-to spot! This is a very special place in the city. The food and coffee are delicious, but the thing that keeps drawing me back again and again is the LOVELY SPACE. This has got to be one of the most spacious and well laid out places for friends, families and communities to come together. The gift shop is well-designed and beautifully curated. The staff is friendly and always helpful. Michelle creates such a great atmosphere! We really appreciate the drive-thru option for busy mornings. There's even a splash pad for the kiddos! We love you, Luci's at the Orchard!"}
{"text":"smarter version of lagrande orange....dig the vibe.....been craving crepes for far too long. check."}
{"text":"Rude & snobby counter staff, aggressive table hoarding by other patrons, poorly executed food (please actually toast the bagels & serve the food while its hot), dirty dishes & silverware with servers who refuse to acknowledge that truth ... No thank you.  Such a pretty place - wish the managers had better control of the situation."}
{"text":"Ok first of all they have their landline without service...I tried to call my friends to let them know  I was on my way and it was impossible...  This was my first visit to the Orchard, it's a very nice place in a residential neighborhood, you can easily miss it if you are speeding or distracted, they have parking lot in front and in the back, and it's surrounded by trees.  The ambience is relaxed, they have a splash pad for  the little ones, and some tables with shade. They do also sell ice cream and drinks, breakfast all day and sandwiches-salads and chicken nuggets for the kids, but you need to make a loooong line to check out, even it they do have 2 cashiers working at the same time.  I wish they had more shade,specially on the top of the splash pad, it's very nice to enjoy the sunshine however we are in March and the sun is already \"burning\" I cannot imagine June or July temperatures...the kids are running barefoot and the have artificial grass, it was soft for me but my son complained, the paths where kids are walking have some cemented areas and rocks!!!  The kind of rocks that are edgy and pointy...wish I could take a picture but my hands were full... I think they definitely need to consider to improve the place making it more safe but at the same time kid friendly. Also I wish they do recycle and had separate bins I was not able to find any.   Also when I was about to pick my drink I found they have Perrier, but the fridge was broken or just off, so it was not cold....another disappointment    Talking now about the food, I ordered a spicy crunchy chicken sandwich with salad and a strip chicken nuggets with fries for my kid, I ordered my sandwich to go, and once I got home and opened my box I was really disappointed... First no extra napkins, just the small thin napkins that comes with your plastic fork, also no seasonings, I found my friends who ate at the place had for them so I expected I had them included too, nope...zilch  Then when I gave the first bite to my sandwich I found the chicken was dry and burnt..I attached  a picture of my son chicken nuggets and the chicken of my sandwich so you can compare and tell I'm not crazy haha  I figured out the chipotle color added darkness, however no...it was over fried..I understand they have many costumers and orders to fulfill, maybe not enough staff at the kitchen, maybe the person who cooked my chicken was afraid of substitution for a new one and take longer or to be charged for the one they burned...I don't know however my experience was not the one I was expecting, I felt like if I ordered some chicken sandwich from KFC and still KFC would be better because it's not burnt! considering they do also have a restaurant next door from part of the same business, well I expected the same quality of food and service according to the place, anyway maybe next time I will visit early morning, I will keep my kid with sandals all times and I will stick with drinks instead of trying to experience tasting their food, and I will suggest you to do the same."}
{"text":"A great place for families... Delicious food and room for the kids to play. More of a cafe type atmosphere (which we love).  We live in the neighborhood and find that this is a charming place to take out-of-town family for a relaxed meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food & such a cute place. We enjoyed burgers and beers on the patio. I had driven by several times & wanted to check it out. Glad we did. Make sure you try the gelato!"}
{"text":"Luci's doesn't care what their customers have to say, but here it goes. My partner and I have been wanting to try Luci's and just haven't gotten to it. Well we finally did and it was mostly a disappointment. I'll give 2 stars on the fact that one of our orders was decent...the burger. Basic burger, nothing special about it but not terrible.   The terrible: I ordered a pressed sandwich based on employee review...ham, green chili...seemed like something good. Well I didn't realize they use subpar \"lunch meat\". Subway would have been better. The green chili was crunchy and not at all cooked. The lunch meat made the sandwich a soggy mess. The potato salad sounds good but it has zero flavor and is very dry.   I'd avoid this place and save yourself the disappointment."}
{"text":"Sad to say, I ordered two simple beers and waited outside for 20 minutes. This is the second time I've been here and I s a joke that takes this long. I said something to the server and just said that's normal."}
{"text":"Sorry  But $13.00 for two SMALL iced coffees is stupid expensive !!      Who the .... do they think they are ?  Don't mind paying for good things but this plain offended me  Never going back"}
{"text":"We tried to have a large group of people come to the restaurant (people that tend to eat and drink a lot btw) and we were hit with this. Not what I would expect from a business like this. Limited menu, no split checks, $100 'service fee' on top of a 20% tip AND eating underground?!  Might want to change your policies."}
{"text":"Nice place! Found this place after a recommendation from another cafe. Has a rustic and modern feel. Food is good."}
{"text":"Service and food are inconsistent which is a shame because I've always loved the Luci's on 16th and Bethany Home. Nearly every time I've been here, I've received food that's under or over cooked, and when I've taken the time to inform the staff, no effort was made to remedy the issues...very disappointing."}
{"text":"Cant say enough good things about this place, It's our family favorite. First, the location is Beautiful! There is a yard area with tables and chairs for seating, or if you are like us, you can grab a smoothie (very berry, YUM!) or (my personal favorite) an Arnold Palmer and sit on the grass to enjoy your treats. At night it is beautifully lit with lights that really give off an amazing ambiance. Second, there is something here for everyone. We have small kids and it's hard to find a place where you can enjoy some food with kids who feel like poking around and exploring. One of the reasons we love the Orchard so much is how family friendly it is. We can sit at a table and enjoy our food which is always amazing( the monkey french toast, OMG) and adult beverages (they have great draft beers) while our kids play on the splash pad. Aside from the super yummy food and drinks, they property houses Splurge, the Gelato shop. Fresh and amazing Gelato with a variety of toppings. The splurge shop itself is adorable and feels retro with a variety of different candies that I can never resist :) The nights when we are lucky enough to have a babysitter and want to get out by ourselves? We visit Pomelo. The restaurant is gorgeous and chic, the food is amazing,the price is on point and the service is always great. They also have really awesome happy hour specials. We live a short distance from the Orchard and it is exactly what this area needed.  It really is a wonderful place to enjoy delicious things, relax, listen to live music and get to know the community. Love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere-- during the day, it's a great place for kids and dogs! Splash pad for the little ones is a great treat! Food was very good-- slightly overpriced, I feel but high quality. At night it's for the romantics with twinkling lights and cozy seating areas! Definitely worth trying!"}
{"text":"I love this place for the food and the ambiance. Even when they are busy and kids are running around by the fountain, sitting outside is still a nice experience.   I even enjoy sitting under the trees and listening to the chirping of the birds. It's a little getaway place for me especially after teaching my high impact group fitness class. This is my 'go to' place when I need a quick bite to eat that's fresh and good.   Their little shop inside will certainly keep you entertained and intrigued. They sell some quirky things and gifts."}
{"text":"Good food, but it was very overpriced.  I asked for a side salad and it was a $10 charge, yikes!  The environment outside is lovely and my kids enjoyed the setting.  Would have been better if the ice cream wasn't the first thing you see when you walk in the door for lunch- and if the splash pad had been turned on."}
{"text":"Spent a few hours here for lunch today. Cobb salad was delicious! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love love love this new location! It's spacious and fun for the whole family. It fit the bill when we needed to meet up w friends that have young kids due to the splash pad. I got juice and the tuna wrap. Really hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast on an early Sunday morning before a spring training game. It was almost full when we got here but the line was out the door when we left. So get here early! The orchard omelette was very good. Eggs were neither dry nor undercooked. The bagel and lox were average and I wouldn't get them again. We enjoyed the excellent coffee and juice on the well shaded patio. We'll definitely stop by again on a return trip."}
{"text":"I've liked Luci's Marketplace for a while and was excited to see their new addition to their empire.   And I'm impressed.  This is actually three restaurants in one area: Pomelo is the upscale entry, Splurge the dessert, choice and Luci's at the Orchard (aka the Orchard) which my target for the evening.  They offer a variety of breakfast options and serve breakfast all day.   I went with the organic, grass-fed burger.  It was one of the finer burgers I've had.    Now the original plan was to eat some delicious food (check) and then let the little one play in the splash pad (uncheck).  Splash pad open from 6 am to 6 pm (weekends?).  I would think 9 am to 9 pm would make more sense.  I'm certainly more in a splash pad mood from 6 pm - 9pm then 6 am to 9 am.     The courtyard between the three restaurants is gorgeous.   Lots of misters and a chill place to hang out.  Parking can get crowded.  There were a few large groups in attendance that evening so that may have been the issue.     This is a great addition to the Phoenix food scene and the Orchard is on our short list of places to bring out of town guests."}
{"text":"Finally made it here! I have been meaning to try this place for awhile now but every time I tried they were super busy. We came on a Monday morning around nine and it was not too busy at all. I ordered the corned beef eggs Benedict and an iced vanilla latte. OMG the eggs Benedict was so.good. The English muffin tasted homemade, the cilantro hollandaise sauce was so flavorful, and it had tons of corned beef piled on top. I loved it. The potatoes on the side were also good. My vanilla latte was great also. The best part about Luci's definitelyhas to be the atmosphere. It was so fun to sit outside and let my baby play on the grass and have room to play. I didn't realize there was a splash pad but I will definitely come back in the summer more prepared! they also have super cute stuff inside to look at and buy like the original Luci's. Love love love!"}
{"text":"We just finished up here and ordered ice cream specifically to take a photo for a gender reveal for our daughter. Connor D helped us and he was GREAT! So friendly and took his time making the most beautiful ice cream! More than that he was super friendly and helpful! We went back after to grab some more treats for tomorrow and he helped us again. This was probably our best experience here at this location! Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"Fun and inviting place for breakfast, brunch, lunch. Great coffee, great atmosphere and the patio is very relaxing."}
{"text":"This past weekend, we celebrated my Dad's 90th Birthday party at Luci's!  The staff did a fantastic job!  Specials thanks to Linda and Serg!  You guys did a wonderful Job, you went beyond our expectations!  The food was delicious!  Our guests said it was the best pork chops and halibut they have ever eaten.  Your servers were wonderful, so attentive to our guests needs.  I would highly recommend planning your next family/friends event at Luci's!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Perfect for small children. Very child friendly, big open lawn and splash pad. The smoothies and teas are good too. I don't drink coffee, but I come here frequently with my daughter."}
{"text":"Finally! Someone in Phoenix creates a patio with trees, greenery, shade and water! On the site of a former nursery, the folks who built Luci's and Pomelo at The Orchard did a great job with the interior and exterior decor and landscaping. There's plenty of parking, too. Luci's has a charming interior with fun and quirky gifts to buy. You order at the counter and the servers bring your food to your table. The mochas are delish. My only beef? The food's just not that good. If it was better, I would have given it the extra star. If you have a business meeting and don't want to be around squealing little ones, stay away from the patio. It has a splash pad and the kids go crazy for it. But if you're there to just hang out, it's entertaining to watch them."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place I love the setting it's in my neighborhood but the food is just so so and it's way overpriced"}
{"text":"Being a fan of Luci's at 16th and Bethany I really hate to put this place down but the last two visits have been way below expectations.   Lunch a week ago was just OK as far as the food but we attempted to eat on the back patio near the kiddie fountain and were overcome by flies!! It was gross. Note to Luci, Bottle Trees or plastic bags with water in them. (It works look it up)  Went again for brunch today. More flies though not as bad as a week ago. Breakfast was tasteless. The Carmel Almond Fruit tea and the Smuckers jam were the highlights of the visit.  Not sure whats wrong here but it definitely needs work before I will be returning."}
{"text":"Love the juice! I've never tried the food, but it looks amazing. Really cute trendy place, always seems busy since it opened. Lots of knick knacks and other items to purchase while you wait for drinks and food too."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this place and was excited to show my sisters this new cute place. Unfortunately, I would have gave 5 stars but the customer service by Sam R (cashier) was not pleasant or welcoming. As I heard her take a customers order before me she had an attitude. The lady simply asked if she needed the table number to take with her and she said in a rude tone \"yes you need to take the order number\" as the costumer walked alway Sam R rolled her eyes. As I walked up to place my order I was not greeted..First and foremost, that is the #1 rule of customer service! Secondly, my sisters order after me and again Sam R had a rude attitude towards them. My suggestion is to properly train this Sam R on customer service. Overall, I will give the food a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Love the location and the patio area of this place. Good is good. Drinks are good. Love the splash pad for my kid. And the associates are friendly.   Operations have gone downhill. We used to come last year almost every other Saturday and had no problem.  Now, on Saturdays and Sundays (at least), be prepared to wait 30 minutes to order your food/drinks with lines out the door. Management does not seem to know how to staff for high volume times because they have 1 person taking orders and 1 person making coffee/tea drinks. With the amount of people you have coming through those doors, 1 more cashier and 1 more barista would make the flow thru so much better and your people while already wonderful would have far less stress.  MOMS and DADS... please be aware that you cannot change your children outside anymore for the splash pad unless you want to be embarrassed by management. I was changing my kiddo (which I've done MANY times before at the Orchard) on my own personal blanket in the grass and a manager ran up to me and reached out a hand to cover my child's nether regions (did not actually touch it) and let me know that this was part of the dining room and that we could not change kids outside. They do let dogs inside the building which I also thought wasn't allowed... but... ?  This manager in general was not very friendly when we had an interaction inside either so maybe it's just him.  All this to say that we probably still will come to the Orchard occasionally because it's the only splash pad that is relatively close to home and I love the Passport green tea and patio but things arent as great as they used to be which could be easily fixed."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast here. The restaurant is welcoming and the courtyard is appealing. Early enough to beat the heat, we opted for the outdoor path.  Our food ingredients were fresh and the coffee quite good. This is a great place to group ride your bike too or group hang out in the courtyard.  Luci's doubles as a store with all kinds of fun stuff to look at. You can't miss the place as it is noted with a giant water tower noting the Orchard. Highly recommended!  #vino2 #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Lovely little place in Phoenix that offers a good breakfast and lunch menu. Food was amazing, but if you go during peak hours for lunch, good luck finding a table if you have 4+ in your party. The outdoor seating is nice with canopies for shade. The prices are fair-high for some. They have some really cute boutique style items on sale inside."}
{"text":"First visit today with some girlfriends and very cool atmosphere and food was great.  I had the Luci's burger and it was pretty tasty.  Also had taste of southwest salad and it was delicious.  Will definitely come again for brunch."}
{"text":"I've gone to Luci's Marketplace which I like,  and was told about this place so me and my girlfriends decided to try it out. Its a, find your own table, type of restaurant. Its a good thing I got there before the rest of my party because I had to hunt down a table. Its so packed that people are helicoptering around tables that may free up. I even saw a squabble between two parties about who got to the table first. NOPE. I HATE having to hunt a table down. Heaven forbid you wait in the long line to order your food first and then end up not finding a table to sit at. Its just ridiculous. Then there's people who know others are waiting to sit, they've finished their meal and just sit around chatting the morning away when they really should move on and let someone have their table.  I think this system works during the week when it's not as busy, but on weekends, they really should have a host seating people.  The food- I didn't bother taking a picture of. I got the traditional breakfast which had scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, roasted potatoes and toast. Nothing to rave about. The others got the Orchard omelette and chilaquiles which neither of them found too special.  Overall, we wouldn't come back. Too much hustle and inconvenience to find our own seat for food that wasn't terrible - just not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"Definitely not in same league as la Grande Orange  Similar style but just not hitting that level ."}
{"text":"Great selection of breakfast items and everything we bought was delicious!  Cute shop, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Good latte.  Lousy blueberry scone.  Not flaky at all.  Dough is overworked and overbaked and there are about six blueberries. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Love this place and the set up.  So peaceful and quiet. Super kid friendly, and a beautiful atmosphere. I love coming here with my little one to relax and enjoy the weather.  Although I do not like all the fly's, but it's typical for an outside patio.   If you order any salad make sure to ask if they can add a little more dressing because each time I've ordered salads, the dressing is a little light.   They also have an ice cream shop that I have not been to, but I'm sure it's delish. I would love to have an event here or my baby shower."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, amazing atmosphere and phenomenal service!  I highly recommend the Reuben sandwich and grass organic beef hamburger"}
{"text":"Im in love with the atmosphere of this place and all they have to offer the mocha I had got me hooked for life! Wish it was on my way to work each morning I would be in bliss daily!! Must visit this place would be ideal for a date or two.. or more!"}
{"text":"I've been to Luci's marketplace plenty of times before but I went to the orchard for the first time a couple weeks ago. The location is really cool! I like the outdoor area and all of the different sections. A cool place to go when the weather is nice out! I decided to order the veggie burger since that is my favorite thing to get at the marketplace location. I excepted it to be the same, but it wasn't. The one at the orchard just wasn't as good, they use a premade patty, I didn't think they did at the other location but I might be wrong! Was pretty crowded there too and parking was a challenge. But otherwise cool! I'd like to come back!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite brunch place! My go to favorites are the Burrito Bomb & the Funky Monkey French Toast."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Has a small gift shop with unique toys and local made souvenirs.  Good for smoothies, baked goods and of course breakfast.  Generous portions of home cooked breakfast items.  The biscuits and eggs are good, the bomb breakfast burrito is good, and the egg sammies do not disappoint either!  Cute outdoor seating area to boot!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to get breakfast/lunch/brunch definitely recommend going there food taste amazing I wish I knew I lived so close to it long time ago"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite spot for mimosas & breakfast with live music on Sunday morning! When we first got there the line was out the door but it moved pretty quick and we were amazed that we didn't have to wait a long time for our food, despite how busy it was!   The $5 mimosas kept us happy while we waited and we loved that there is a separate drink ordering counter so we could get our mimosa refills without having to jump back in the long food ordering line!   We both had the Spaniard omelette that has chicken and chorizo and it was delicious!   While the inside of the place is super neat with all kinds of cute merchandise, the outdoor patio and open grass area is really where it's at. Beautiful trees and greenery all around make you forget you're in the desert for a second! The last two Sunday's we've enjoyed live acoustic music from a girl and her guitar (beautiful voice). She started playing and singing around 9ish I believe.   Before we visited Luci's at the orchard we went to the Luci's marketplace which was neat--- but now that we've experienced the orchard, there's no turning back! We love it!"}
{"text":"As someone who tuned out the original Luci's years ago (the review is around -- that place just has me shaking my head), I was hesitant to visit the Orchard in the first place. Well, I don't know who took control of this one but Luci's at the Orchard is excellent and the dining experience is a complete 180 from the original Luci's.   The menu has a list of options from classic egg dishes to your more granola options, plus the standard selection of baked goodies and blended drinks. The little shop area in the store is worth browsing but the kicker about Luci's at the Orchard is the space. The seating is plentiful with both inside and outside options. Tucked away north of Glendale there, the Orchard is a great little weekend brunch option."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the Luci's at the Orchard. The property looked so inviting. They have seating outside as well as inside. It was a week day around 930 am  the place was very busy I ordered a simple white hot chocolate but what I got was a coffee latte with white chocolate. I took it back and they remade my WHC without hesitation. Unfortunately it was the worst WHC I have ever had. It tasted like warm milk with a splash of white chocolate . I also asked if they had any gluten free pastries and they replied no. Unfortunately I will not be rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Luci's is the perfext spot to spend a free afternoon with a great atmosphere that is very intentional to highlight Arizona culture while not neglecting the quality of of its food and drinks. I could easily spend hours reading outside underneath the trees and misters."}
{"text":"This place was great! We had the chunky monkey French toast and it was so yummy. The ambiance is awesome and would be great to sit outside when the weather is nice. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here as this seemed like such a great concept. I got my 2 year old all jazzed up for the splash pad. Truth be told, getting some drinks and treats for the adults, and using the splash pad was really our primary reason for coming to check this place out. We arrived at 3:15p on Saturday.....to a closed splash pad. Try explaining that to a 2 Year old. Disappointed :( Don't know if we will return again. I had such high hopes and feel bummed"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and much more room than the other Luci's locations and better parking!"}
{"text":"Cute, quaint & delicious. Great place for families with small children to eat outside (under shade) & let those lil ones giggle their wiggles out! Bring a change of clothes for them - the water feature is the bonus!"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  I love the layout and general vibe of the place. The employees I have come in contact with have all been great. I have had the turkey melt, the club (both with the killer potato salad) and the veggie omelet. All the food has been great.  I have been here on a Sunday at noon, a Thursday at 11 and a Saturday at 10:30. Even the Thursday was down to circle the parking lot looking for parking by 11:30. I have trouble recommending this place without mentioning the lack of parking and the chance that you may wait in line to order 20-30 minutes. And when they are that busy you may end up standing to eat.  A solid 3-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"If you like busy full parking lots that you have to circle around only to give up and park ¼ mile away, this is your spot  If you like circling tables waiting for someone to move to grab yourself & friends a seat, this is your spot.  If you enjoy standing in an never ending line to order your food, yep this is your place! Went to Luci at the Orchard on a Sunday afternoon to meet up with friends, and let's just say I most likely will not be coming back.  Granted it was a Sunday afternoon, everyone is out and about, but it seemed there were more people then parking and chairs, and if you know you're a busy place, maybe look into an overflow parking lot?  I ordered the zesty chicken salad, it was a bed of greens with roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, pablano peppers, black beans, grilled chicken breast, avocado and cilantro with a chipotle ranch dressing, this salad was good, everything was fresh, I loved that they give you a nice portion of avocado. This was a great tasting salad, I will say that. Is it great enough to have me come back? Naw I'm already turned off by the lack of parking & seating options.  But I have been told they are slower on the weekdays and the grounds of the Orchard are cute, just go at your risk."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, at the recommendation of my sister. Wow!  I met my son here as he was breezing thru town. This place has lots of personality!  They have cute indoor seating along with a unique boutique. Then, they have a beautiful outdoor seating area. I'm an Arizon native, but don't like the summer heat much - so we sat inside. The food was also awesome. I had the pancakes - they were perfect."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Luci's other location many times, this was my first time trying the Orchard location. My boyfriend and I came for sunday brunch. I got a smoothie and the orchard omelet and he got the corned beef benedict. The food was great. The atmosphere is great too, a little more quaint than the other location. Just be warned it's super busy on weekends so it could take a little while to get your food!"}
{"text":"I finally checked this out after so many recommendations! It is awesomeeeee. Such a cute little place to grab a cup of coffee and food and meet some locals! I only wish it was closer to home. I will be definitely coming back though. Great place!!"}
{"text":"Great pancakes! Fun place to take little ones so they can run around while you eat and sip coffee."}
{"text":"Great place to go and hang out for an afternoon alone to study or even to hang out with friends! Food has always been amazing and the merchandise is worth the time to look over!"}
{"text":"Such a cute location with great outdoor space to sit and let the little ones play. Food is tasty it not memorable to the degree that makes you want to rush back - but there are few places in that bracket (Snooze, maybe).  Great little shop to look around inside whilst you decide on what to order, too."}
{"text":"I love the new additional Luci's!!! It's not crowded, plenty of parking, lots of seats and tables, big patio and yard and the food is delightful!!! I wasn't a big fan of the original Luci's on Bethany Home and 16th St because it was stressful to even dine there for the limited parking, long lines and limited seats, but this one is a complete 180!  They have a different menu then the original and the food is so much better too!! I had the chilaquiles and hubby had the crepes. The chilaquiles had the perfect crunch, chunks of avocado and a generous portion of chicken and eggs! The crepes wasn't too sweet and very fluffy. I loved every bite I had.   I'll be visiting often especially when the weather starts cooling down."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great Iced Latte and I highly recommend the Orchard Omelette!  Staff is friendly, great service!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place to try with the family, wish they had more seating. The staff is sometimes amazing and sometimes too crazed to help. Frequently they don't have any high chairs free and we have to sit on the grass."}
{"text":"Ambiance is wonderful however brunch on weekends can be a little disjointed. It's going to be crowded. If you want an alcoholic drink, it can't be ordered where you order your food so you end up standing in 2 separate lines. I also really wish they'd put a turkey burger or veggie burger (preferably both) on the menu."}
{"text":"Hands down my fav place to go!! So glad they opened a second location at the orchard. It's perfect!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was not the best here. I got the avocado toast. The toast was burnt and the whole meal was so dry and lacked flavor.  This comes with egg whites and I should have asked for sunny side up eggs because the egg whites just add to the blandness.   There is great seating out back and I could see this being a nice place to sit and read a book while drinking sone tea or coffee."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place.  It was very crowded with a long line to order.  Luckily we found a table for the four of us.  It took a long time to get our orders, but since it was so busy, I did not worry about it.  They gave us a number to put on the table.  We saw the servers walking around the restaurant both inside and out holding plates of food looking for the number associated with the order.  It was no surprise when we saw them take please outside and search and then walk inside still looking.  I was not surprised when our breakfasts came to the table with cold food.  I must say $10 for the traditional breakfast is way too much for such a small mediocre plate of food.  The atmosphere was very family oriented.  Lots of babies and dogs. Beautiful weather and pleasant tables to meet with family and friends."}
{"text":"Great find in Phoenix! Came for brunch and everything was delicious, eggs are fluffy and pancakes are huge and delicious! They also have a splash pad outside, and a ice cream parlor with amazing mint chip! The blood orange flavor is also great!"}
{"text":"I love their biscuits and gravy.... but today it was ruined by a week old, stale biscuit underneath. Very disappointing when the cooks know the quality of the food they are serving is bad, but choose to serve it anyway."}
{"text":"Cute place to order at the counter and eat outside on their adorable patio. Super family-friendly - Luci's includes an indoor market and an outdoor splash pad. Affordable prices. Pretty good food: I enjoyed the French toast and the breakfast sandwich, but the breakfast burrito was just kinda bland and the skirt steak was alternately tough and fatty. The green tea smoothie is delicious, however.  Overall, I would go back, even if just to hang out and drink a smoothie and eat a muffin."}
{"text":"Central Phoenix asked & Luci's Urban Concepts answered in spades.   Luci's at the Orchard is an incredible property, fit for just about anyone. The counter service restaurant offers great customer service and incredible food that leans more toward really-freakin-well-done comfort food than Luci's Healthy Marketplace @ 16th/Bethany. They do have salads -I hear- but I can't take a break eating the French toast and chicken sandwich to find out.   Also found within the Luci's space at the Orchard is a retail market with adorable trinkets, perfect gifts and plenty of other odds and ends you'll just have to have. There's a fully stocked bar with beer, liquor and wine in the middle and can't forget Splurge- the sweet little gelato shop. Try the \"Mint to be for Nick\" flavor, it's super good and is named in honor of a local boy fighting a terminal illness.   You'll be hard pressed to find a better patio in Uptown. The Splashpad & surrounding tables is a great space for little ones and their families while the front porch & accompanying rocking chairs  are perfect for a quiet escape."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos there are really tasty, I get mine with no meat and extra eggs! The house salsa that it comes with is fresh and a great add on, I just wish it had a little more kick to it! I could eat one every day! The coffee was a little burnt which was a downfall for me- as I went there to work one day and any workday without coffee isn't great! I've also tried their French toast and omelettes and I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"This might be my favorite place in Phoenix. As a long time fan of Luci's healthy marketplace, I had high expectations for the Orchard and they were completely surpassed. The location is like no other in Phoenix, it is instantly charming inside and out. I usually go there during the weekends for brunch, but have visited at all times of day. The menu is great and I've loved everything I've tried, great place to hang out on the weekends or work during the week. Definitely check this place out at some point."}
{"text":"Luci's at the Orchard is at the PINNACLE of what outstanding food, service, music, ambience and location is!!! If I could give it 10 stars I would! This was my first visit to this restaurant. From the moment I arrived, until I was departing with my delicious raspberry blood orange gelato, every aspect of this restaurant was on point! Ron Pacioni, General Manager is so professional yet very personable and runs a well oiled restaurant and superb staff!! And the location and decor of the 3 restaurants are beautiful, antique and serve generous portion sizes of delicious food and desserts. Family oriented yet nice for single adults to lounge in the bar area. And it has a splash fountain area for kiddies to cool off! I HIGHLY recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Always a grest place for a delicious breskfast after a good early morning hike! The coffee always great and hot! Grest plscr to share with friends and fsmily along with an occasional client! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful place in a beautiful quiet location. This place gets my 5 stars for having such a wonderful place combines with the either restaurant. Beautiful outdoor space that families and kids can have fun. Went there with my friends and it was quite a treat for me as it was my first time, the weather was nice and outdoor seating was available.   The menu is very diverse as they serve a collection of sandwiches and breakfast items. I went with the morning run burrito and a cup of Arnold palmer. The food was definitely delicious but nothing out of the ordinary. I was not disappointed with my choice I just think it lacked a little bit of flavor. Yet if you're used to super healthy food that may lack flavor, this burrito is definitely good for you.  I would order it again but I'll make sure get some salt and pepper packets from the bar just to season it a bit. The side of fruit was a nice addition, but very tiny portion. All in all a great experience and I can not wait to go back."}
{"text":"What a quaint and inviting atmosphere brought my very good friend here with her family for a bite to eat, the staff was very friendly and accommodating to her families requests. The choices we made were prepared freshly and the drinks available were many options to choose from. The novelty part of the entrance was very fun and entertaining.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Unreal facilities that will impress any party or business meeting.  The entire venue was built with character, history and sentimental value in everything designed.  Great outdoor seating, restaurant, bar, menu and service.  Go here for a great time or to impress friends/business."}
{"text":"Amazing Coffee! Well trained and knowledgeable Batista's. Great breakfast menu wide selection of grab and go food. Cute gift shop"}
{"text":"This morning was my first experience at this Luci's.   The setting was nice.  However my breakfast was D+.  The price was VERY HIGH. I ordered 2 poached eggs(fine), crisp hashbrowns(not sure if cooked), Crisp toast (floppy as if untoasted cold), ONLY 1 piece of toast, bacon 3 strips (cold).  Cost including coffee-no refills $13.72.  NO ONE came back to ask how our meals were or even acknowledge our presence after serving. Afterward toured the adjacent Pomello.  Not quite open for service but during our walk thru saw a few tables with last nights left over tidbits on them.  Prices again very expensive.  They need to take one or two steps back refocus the business plan train the staff otherwise the venue will not hold either restaurant together."}
{"text":"This spot is adorable! I went the first time a few weeks ago and have already been back a few times.   Their coffee is delicious and made quickly even when the lines are long. I've had their corned beef eggs Benedict and I'm in love. So yum! I love the little shop inside, so many unique items. My 1yr old can spend hours at their splash pad. The relaxed atmosphere is refreshing. I've never felt rushed, everyone seems to be relaxed. It's a great place to go when I don't have to keep an eye on time, and just want a safe fun place for me and my baby to hang out."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or brunch. Really kid friendly indoor and outdoor seating. Food is great, I had the Burrito Bomb and Toxin Boxin juice. Great, good sized portions and tasty!"}
{"text":"Cute little \"cafe\" in Phoenix. I'll admit the set up was a little confusing, especially if it was your first time.   Initially I couldn't tell where the cafe began and the little indoor marketplace ended. The food is was simple and delicious. The drinks were good as well.  The girls were super nice and made my friend and me feel very welcome.  The only complaint I have is the parking is slightly confusing, and the prices are a little too high. However, being in that part of Phoenix, it's a given.  Luci's was cute and a great experience!"}
{"text":"My new favorite local morning meet up spot. The atmosphere is beautiful and showcases what I love about AZ."}
{"text":"This is the cutest place!  Beautiful grounds, a splash pad for kids, orchard, a gift shop with lots of great stuff!!! It gets a little crowded on holidays and weekends, so get there early. If there's no seating, or if you're more of the picnic type, throw a blanket down on the grass and let the kiddos play! The service is great with super friendly employees, and they can whip up a mean espresso drink in the blink of an eye! I would go back just for the coffe drinks. Breakfast burritos are delicious, French toast is yummy and the juices are fresh and delicious! They have super healthy stuff and they have bacon and eggs.  There really is something for EVERYONE in the family here!"}
{"text":"A charming outside setting with trees and grass. The area with the picnic tables looked messy though. My chicken salad was not zesty as promised--it needed a spicy dressing. Greens were good and the chicken was generous. Looked forward to an ice cream cone at Splurge but it was not special at all, and they had no sugar cones. I'll try a breakfast next time or go next door to Pomelos."}
{"text":"Just like Luci's on Bethany, but tucked away in a cute little area. Good food, drinks, and other cool stuff. Parking is extremely limited."}
{"text":"Great new location on 12 street north of Glendale on the west side of the road. The place is BRAND NEW and the atmosphere is just awesome. I come here on Thursday mornings after a run with a few friends and the food is pretty darn good. So far the biscuits & gravy with subside egg is just ridiculously delicious.  I also love the chiliquias (probably spelling it wrong), the oatmeal is great and so are the burritos. I do wish the coffee was self serve but it's good also. They have lots of room inside and just a beautiful courtyard outside where we usually sit. They sell lots of little stuff too like Cracker Barrel but not nearly as much, lots of pastries too."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood gem! The location feels like you are in a different little town than Phx. There is green trees everywhere and the outdoor patio makes for perfect brunch outdoors. The breakfast is great my favorite grab and go is the açaí bowl.  Love checking out all the cute gifts the have for sale while I wait for my coffee or Food.  Perfect for families and small children!!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute and perfect for moms to get together and hangout while letting the little ones run around. Very kid friendly! Plenty of open space."}
{"text":"Lovvvvve this place. Great food, coffee and fun treats/trinkets. Best of all is the atmosphere! Perfect place to sit outside on a nice day."}
{"text":"Delicious, and HUGE breakfast quickly served. Excellent staff and a lovely setting. If I lived in PHX I'd make this place a regular hangout. Hey Luci's at the Orchard, how about an expansion in the Austin area!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful place, I was so excited to visit a small business. Walked into a small shopping experience and went through the line to order and shop more while you wait for your food.  Food ordered, we were given our number and sat down at a bar looking out onto the patio. Even on Christmas Eve morning, people were enjoying the patio with the heaters turned on.  We ordered a regular breakfast plate and I was excited by the Funky Monkey French toast Gluten-free. Our food arrived and I looked at a plate of regular looking French toast. Still not having gotten my drink, food was dropped and we didn't see anyone again... I went up front and asked about my drink and was told that it was sitting at the other counter. Nice, you give me a number indicating that it would be delivered to our table. She was completely unapologetic and said, no it gets made and sits there there... So I asked about the Gluten-free funky monkey. Turns out if you order Gluten-free you get regular Gluten-free bread... Not the Funky monkey cinnamon French toast as the menu reads. All in all, disappointed. Service was not good. I won't be back.   Posted are photos showing the menu GF Funky Monkey and actual served French toast"}
{"text":"Amazing chliaquiles, love the veggie omelet. Great juice bar! Try the Oasis, so refreshing get! My friend Dreas got the Toxins Boxin'. Great atmosphere, fresh & healthy and yummy!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places in Phoenix! They have it all! The marketplace serves salad, sandwiches, smoothies, beer, wine, juices and best of all breakfast is served all day! (We always go for the Funky Monkey French Toast). But it's doesn't stop there. Connected to the marketplace is Splurge (a homemade gelato shop that will satisfy your sweet-tooth) The gelato is all natural and the flavors always change, they even have an adult-only root beer float, and don't forget to indulge in some of the retro candy they sell.  Once you decide on some food and gelato make sure to take it outside and bask in the Arizona sun (under misters and of course shade) You can even bring your little ones to play in the splash pad!"}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere inside and out. Service is great. Food is great. Prices are high and this is definitely a  yuppie-kind of place. If you like yuppie-kind of places then this is an excellent one. I live on a budget and am moving close by but I don't think I will be eating here often because of the prices."}
{"text":"I first came here for a catered baby shower on the grass. It was a very beautiful and serene outdoor experience. There was accoustic music playing on the yard adjacent to our party that added to the ambience. The fish tacos were amazing!! I enjoyed the experience so much I had to share it with my husband...so we went on a daytime date later that same week and had another delicious meal outdoors enjoying the weather and scenery.  The waitress was super attentive and told us about the history of the place. How it used to be a nursery and about the family who owned it and where we could find some of their heirloom trinkets on display. She encouraged us to walk around and explore the bar, the basement dining area and the back where they made a table out of the wood of a tree that had to be cut down in the place the table now sits.  Love the little market and ice cream shoppe... They really did a great job all around."}
{"text":"Dog friendly? ...front porch that's over-run with flies , not actually friendly at all for owners and pets.  Cold food It's great that it is a busy place but being short-staffed unfortunately is shown in the quality."}
{"text":"My Birthday brunch!  First visit to the Orchard location. Same great service and gift shop. The menu is a little different but delicious. I had the Cheddar Biscuits and mushroom gravy, really elevated version of a breakfast classic.   If you love Luci's on Bethany Home Road, then you'll love Luci's at the Orchard!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Luci's for years and must say the food and atmosphere are amazing and that's both locations."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL! My family stopped by today after church. What a delightful place. Luci's had some delicious food and afterwards we went to Splurge for some delicious Gelato. It was a bit warm, Arizona Summer, the trees have misting systems as well as plenty of shade. Grass and a small splashpad. What a delightful getaway from the big city we live in."}
{"text":"Food was DELICIOUS! Service was AWESOME and you'll find the cutest heart touching things to buy!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is 5 star but my breakfast frittata was not hot when it arrived. I noticed another reviewer had the same complaint. The meal looked great, filled with mushrooms, red peppers, spinach, potato chunks and more, but temperature was not right on arrival. Noticed no heat lamps in the area where meals are left for pickup or in kitchen prep area. Food needs to be hot on arrival."}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix for the weekend and came here with my family for breakfast. love LOVE love the ambience here! There's a huge grassy area with picnic table seating and lots of misters outside.  We had breakfast on the patio while my two year old son played on the splash pad. In fact the splash pad was quite the favorite spot for the kids. Only thing I didn't like was that it became over run with people who weren't even customers.... not sure how to address this but it was annoying none the less.   Food was very good, ice tea was extra yummy too! I would love to open something exactly like this in my hometown.... except the patio would be for paying customers only! This place is seriously awesome, and I found it all thanks to YELP!"}
{"text":"Came to Luci's for breakfast and like all the other reviews this is a nice location. Open, lots of parking, and a great outdoor space.   Service was excellent and extremely friendly.   My only issue was the food or at least what I ordered left a lot to be desired.  I ordered the Orchard Omelet. When it arrived it looked and smelled delicious.  My only issue is that once I cut into the omelet all the moisture/water from the veggies was still inside so it was soupy. It would have been helpful if prior to cooking the kitchen drained/dried the veggies properly. There was so much residual water it sucked out all the flavor of the omelet. I literally had to drain it off my plate.   I would come back but I won't be ordering that omelet again."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast spot. Order at the counter (no worries the line moves fast) pick up your coffee and head out to the deck and garden to await you breakfast. Great food and coffee. The perfect spot to relax on a lazy Saturday. Nice little gift shop area with unique items as well"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful. A not so hidden gem as it was packed. There were a few baby showers going on so I understood why the service was slow. The Cobb salad was big, fresh and delicious.   I will be back once the weather stops punishing us so I can sit outside and enjoy the garden. I was turned off by the free roaming screaming kids but that's no fault of the establishment."}
{"text":"This place is lovely. VERY family friendly, and in a great part of town. The coffee drinks are tasty, and so is most of the food. One point for improvement was the egg sandwich. I got scrambled, which probably didn't help, but it came out as a towering stack of overcooked, rubbery and dry plain eggs, with not enough cheese and meat at the very bottom before the bread to liven things up. Hopefully Luci's can work on that, and we will be back."}
{"text":"I would have given more stars, because the patio is really cool and the fact that it definitely kid friendly make it awesome.  My problems with this place lie in the fact that they do not have servers at the table and charge $14 for a burger and $10 for a salad.  I don't mind whatsoever paying that price but I would appreciate service."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed this place. The patio offers such a unique ambiance with many mature trees & green-concept landscapes...a shared common area with many businesses. Outdoor setting is what attracted most to me. I dined at Pomelo (outdoor), had ice-cream/gelato at Splurge, sipping coffee at Luci's.  It has a little water-spouts area for the little ones, in which attracts many families to have a play date for kiddies. Adults have their own perks (sipping coffee or adult beverages) as well.  Come and check out...be cool & chilled like the locals."}
{"text":"This is like going to Disneyland.   I had a lovely latte that had a super creamy taste. Since the pumpkin loaf wasn't in house yet (coming in later in the day), I decided on the cranberry orange muffin. The muffin was so moist, and it broke apart to a beautiful color!   Lots of parking in back. Lots of moms with kids. Lots of food items and lots of reasons to come here!"}
{"text":"The setting is beautiful and the concept is amazing. Great amenities for any occasion and taste. I just have to say so far I'm disappointed in the coffee and breakfast. The drip Coffee was bland and weak, and I ordered a frittata that wasn't cooked long enough. Still runny in the middle and the veggies were all mushy with no flavor. This place is so close to perfect. With a little attention to details and customer service too, this place would be 5 Star."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot in the morning. I usually hit this place before work for a chocolate protein smoothie! The barista's are very knowledgeable and helpful! Especially when it comes to customizing my protein smoothie in the morning since I log everything into MyFitnessPal. It tends to get very crowded around lunch time during the week so I suggest you either order ahead or expect a wait. They also have a splash pad for the little ones which is a plus and an ice cream desert bar in the  back! This is a beautiful place to eat outside when the weather is right! I definitely recommend coming here and trying it for yourself!"}
{"text":"Best place ever. Had a little mix up with my chicken sandwich today but I was soooo pleased with how the incredibly cute waitress handled it. It was a great experience all around and I would highly recommend this place to any one looking for great food and an awesome family friendly atmosphere. Also: some bomb bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"So fun, great atmosphere! Love the coffee at Luci's...."}
{"text":"We often come here for the splash pad and inevitably end up with coffee's, or ice cream or end up staying for dinner! A lovely spot!"}
{"text":"Went to Luci's on a Saturday for brunch & mimosas. This is the second and bigger location on 12th st, which is just a mile or two away from the original and much smaller location.  I enjoyed my brunch here very much! The inside is super cute and the backyard/patio area had its charm. The mimosas were ok tho - probably will not get it again when I come back. There was a long line when we got there but it moved fairly quickly. I do think they can do better with having an organized way of letting first timers know how it works. It gets confusing because when you walk in, there's tables, the little shop in the middle with random things for sale, and the counter to order.   Would definitely come back again. One of the best egg benedicts I've had!"}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it ... As parents to small children we are often searching for kid friendly restaurants and this is as good as it gets ! We loved their menu and the atmosphere  Customer service was amazing even considering our large group . I had the frittata and it was reasonably priced and delicious."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday and sat outside. It was busy, but the food was worth the wait! I could have done without the \"playground\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and coffee and smoothie drinks.  Nice casual outdoor seating with relaxing atmosphere.  The line goes quickly and service is faster than the wait in line."}
{"text":"Twice now, I've enjoyed the vibe at Luci's at the Orchard.  It is a perfect location for a sunny autumn or spring day, basking in the garden setting, and dining on tasty food.    Parking has been a challenge, the first time we lucked out and got a spot in the back, this last weekend we had to circle a couple of times, but finally scored a spot.  This place seems to be popular for birthday parties, as there were parties each time we visited.   Had the chicken chilaquilas the first time, eggs over medium.  It was delicious.  I'd order it again just for the green-chile tomatillo sauce.  The second time we arrived later in the day and had lunch items instead.  My choice was the spicy-crispy chicken sandwich.  It was not bad, not really spicy, but definitely crispy, crispy to the point of almost burnt.  Yet they served it anyway.  It was a bit disappointing, but the sandwich was still quite good, although it did not live up to the spicy name.  You can get your sandwich with a side of fruit, fries or greens.  Feeling like I need to be diet-conscious, I went with the fruit.  After lunch, the ladies had a conversation going, so I wandered over to the fake grassy area and found a nice Adirondack to bask in the sun, listening to the gentle laughing and playing of children.  The venue is more like three different restaurants, Luci's, some Italian place and some sweet shop.  I've heard the pizza at this Italian place is good.  I've only dined at Luci's, which is a combination store/restaurant similar to the LGO concept - which means you can shop for cook kitsch that is over-priced.  The menu prices are high as well, and so far as I can tell, they don't offer refills on coffee or tea."}
{"text":"Don't bring your dog here. Despite advertising as \"dog friendly\" dogs can only be on a small, hot, concrete patio in the front that has minimal shade, no misters and no tables. Dogs cannot be anywhere on the large grassy area or sidewalks in the back, even if you are just waiting for to go food."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service wasn't that great. We had to figure out the process and were confused from start to finish. Now that we know how to order, where to sit and what to do with our plates we'll probably go back since the food was so good."}
{"text":"Got take out breakfast this one time and loved it! I ordered the corned beef benedict and it was a winner. Generous portions of tasty meat with poached eggs cooked right. I added some avocado too. The english muffins were lightly toasted and the hollandaise sauce had good flavors.  Will order from here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Where can you get fantastic gelato after a wonderful meal at Palmelo restaurant or sit in the country store for a cup of coffee or glass of wine. This is really my favorite place. Have to drive from Goodyear but it is worth it."}
{"text":"I tried this place via uberEATS solely becos french toast is life and the funky monkey french toast sounded amazing! And it was good, for the most part. Didn't taste anything spectacular or funky (in a good way ) but it was good and may very well taste even better at the restaurant than after a 15 min ride. I look forward to my visit to the orchard becos it sounds like a beautiful chill spot."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot! Perfect in every way. Came in and got the best desserts. (Sugar cookie, snicker doodle and cinnamon roll)"}
{"text":"Beautiful place! You can come and hang out on the grass or a bench and just enjoy the comforts of a cool and fun place. Lots of great foo dads to buy. There was no problem parking. The servers are so sweet! I'm gonna go back in and get some gifts when I am done with my salad!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood. Love the ambience. Great local breakfast place within walking distance. I only give it 3 stars because the coffee is weak and not of coffee house quality. We asked if they served dark roast and the girls said we have a dark roast and a light roast. I asked for two large dark roasts. The dark roast was a medium roast at best. Starbucks dark roast is worth the mile drive and then go the Lucy's for breakfast. I hope this changes. I'd love to walk down the street for a great cup of coffee. But until then I'll drive to Starbucks or LuX."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant locations in the valley, The Orchard is just lovely. Luci's is kid friendly with great patio seating (complete with misters everywhere, making it quite tolerable in early fall when Phoenix is still pretty warm) and a splash pad. We waited a good bit for our food, after waiting at least 20 minutes in line to order. However, it was 10ish on a Saturday, so waits should be expected most places.   Our breakfasts were all tasty and the monkey bread French toast was top notch, even my son's gluten free French toast option. The omelets were really good and we had no complaints at all.   A little pricier than some places would be for breakfast, but the location and the patio makes it worth it to me."}
{"text":"This was the most adorable restaurant. So convenient, homely and the staff was absolutely wonderful. Food is off the carts. Very afforable with huge portions. We can't wait to become regulars here."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD AND SERVICE!!! Everything is clean paying for my food is quick and the delivery of food is quick! The drinks are phenomenal.  The atmosphere is relaxing and Toni is so friendly :)"}
{"text":"Luci's at the orchard is a great place to sit and enjoy a cup of coffee, treat or meal.  I especially love coming here because of the beautiful grounds, the vibe and love their iced tea and food.   I love the chilaquiles for breakfast!  All that and the fact that it's so kid friendly, there's really not a lot of places like this!  With 3 boys, we always have to pick a place where it's kid friendly otherwise it's torture for us! LOL   They have an ice cream shop, although prices are pretty steep ($4/scoop of ice cream) but I guess we'll suck it up since we can kill a couple hours eating on the patio while kids play in the splash pad and grassy area.  We usually finish our visit with an ice cream cone!   Thanks Luci's for creating such a fantastic place with delicious food."}
{"text":"Order at the counter and still they screw up the order (you have one job!) But fun watching the servers trying to match the orders with tables as they wander about aimlessly."}
{"text":"The only thing this restaurant has going for them is the outdoor patio. Honestly, the employees are grouchy only one guy who works there (African American guy is the only one who ever smiles and appears to enjoy their job.), the food is never consistent and the prices are ridiculous. We have been coming here since they opened, about once every two weeks. It's literally never the same everytime we come. The portions are all over the place, the baked goods (from outside vendors are also not consistent) and people just generally seem grouchy. I get it's early and it's a weekend but I do not want my $5 SIDE of bacon to be cold, hard and overcooked unless I ask for it that way. Also when you walk it up front and ask the grouchy girl for new side and the cooks are all mad and making remarks that's inappropriate. The place isn't cheap, you can't get out of there with two medium portioned breakfasts and two drinks for under $40. The outdoor area is great for parties and kids (they have a splash pad), but if you hate your job and can't smile then probably just quit. Ps we ONLY  go back because my boyfriend likes the cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time with a friend and our little ones. I got the sweet fig and tuna wrap and cheese crisp with fries. The cheese crisp and fries were a hit with the little one! I loved the outdoor seating and how kid friendly it was. It's hard going out to eat with an active 14 month old so it was a nice change!! Would like to go back to try the other places at the orchard!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the original Luci's Healthy Marketplace at 16th Street and Bethany. So I was hoping the appeal of that location would transfer here.   Pros: Beautiful property with lots of outdoor seating. Perfect if you have dogs (or kids). The food and drinks are delicious. And if you can maneuver around the crowds the gift shop has lots of cute options.   Cons: Long wait to order, long wait to get drinks, may have to drive around to find parking (the parking lot is shared with Pomelo), and it's crowded.   I met a few friends on a brisk winter day so I thought it wouldn't be as busy as say a Saturday in March. Based on this visit I can imagine you'd be waiting a very long time when the weather is nice.   I waited in line for 20+ min to put in an order and then another 10 min to get my coffee (an Americano so nothing fancy). Luckily the actual food order was quite fast after this. Once we found a table outside and could eat and drink I really enjoyed Luci's. I don't live in the neighborhood though so perhaps next time I visit I'll opt for drive thru."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go-to place! The ambience is inviting, there are cute trinkets to look at while you order or wait for your food and the staff is laid back. The food is delicious, especially their fries! I love the outdoor seating and love even more that there is an ice cream shop down the hall!"}
{"text":"A destination coffee shop. Here you can eat, drink and be merry. However, be prepared for the attack of the over-excited toddler brigade.  Children can play in the water fountain in the garden while parents watch over them while sipping their favorite beverage. Sometimes the children almost outnumber the adults.  Lots of parking. That gets a two thumbs up!  The cranberry orange muffin was moist and full of flavor.  When we arrived mid-morning, the parking lot was well over half full. Most of the tables, both inside and out, were occupied.  So, I am half way through my review of this coffee shop before I even get to reviewing the actual coffee. It was very smooth, which is not my favorite type of coffee, unless it is an Ethiopian coffee. I should have ordered an extra shot or two in my latte. My bad!   The inside of the store feels like a cross between a Fireworks store and a Cracker Barrel restaurant. For some, this will be the perfect coffee shop, for others it may not be. Try Luci's once and find out for yourself."}
{"text":"Absolutely pleased with Luci's at The Orchard. It's in the smack middle of busy streets! But once you park, walk in, order, sit down, the mood totally transforms into your own personal secret garden. The food is great! Awesome staff, design is beautiful indoors and out. And their ice cream neighbors make it a match made in heaven.  Definitely coming back! Love, peace, more bacon please!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, comfortable setting with a cool layout.    My wife and I shared 2 sandwiches, the Club & the Turkey Melt.  Both quite good with the melt being a little better, we thought.  Not your traditional \"melt\" sandwich doused in cheese.  The cranberry aioli sauce really making the stand out.  Side of potato salad was a bit heavy with onion, next time I'll get the fruit.    My Arnold Palmer was a top shelf beverage.  Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"The fries were cold, the meat in the Ruben was dry. My friends burger was also cold.   The staff disappeared after placing the food in the table. When the manager stopped by just before we left, his only comment was that he would check why this was happening in the kitchen.  After the many great meals, coffees, etc-ce-tera enjoyed at the original Luci's this place falls short. I hope they eventually get it right."}
{"text":"The setting is outstanding. The soup exceptional. The burger good but needed seasonings. The toppings for the burger was lacking. The fruit side so-so. Certainly for fast casual this is a place worthy of your consideration."}
{"text":"I went for a afternoon walk with my bestie and landed at Luci's at the Orchard for some refreshments.   I ordered a Toxin Boxin fresh juice and my friend ordered the Very Berry Smoothie. My friend made a comment that she wished the menu had a list of ingredients for the smoothies because her Very Berry Smoothie had bananas in it, but she liked the Smoothie. I waited around 10 minutes for my juice and walked up to the drink station to find out that their juicer broke. The staff stated that they would refund me the money for the juice and asked me if I wanted something else. I ended up just buying an iced tea and she stated she would refund me the difference.   I am only giving this location a 4 star because I have been here multiple times and have been pretty satisfied with the breakfast. I mostly enjoy the ambience it's a great spot to relax with friends or do some work/studying. It does get a little loud in the mornings, so bring noise canceling headphones."}
{"text":"I love this place but they really need to get some wine to serve.  Only having Pinot Noir for your red wine is not working for me.  Add a merlot, (especially if it is from Washington) . Good wine sells.  I love the outdoor concept and this will only get better with the better weather.  The folks who work here make the place the best.  The gelato server is a true asset as is the entire staff including the dishwasher who poked his head out and tried to help because it was busy.  Bravo for finding people who enjoy where they work - it shows.  I hated taking a star away but until you have some wine by the glass selection...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! Kind of in a residential area but easy to find..Delicious food!! Plenty of options! Breakfast all day, sandwhiches, salads,burgers, gelato, a coffee shop, gift shop, and splash pad for the kiddos..really nice outdoor seating with misters..indoor seating as well. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and will be back to visit!"}
{"text":"I love how cute it is in here. The decor is so simple just rustic and good vibe feel. While you wait for your food you're shopping. Haha. I got mints, a bag of chips and a necklace.  The flapjacks with strawberries and blueberries Got chiliciles here. No chicken and bacon please with extra Avocados. Yummmmnn.  The courtyard is so family oriented and full of kids at the slash pad area. They also have tables outside of you want to dine outside.   I love just over love this place! Yummmmm"}
{"text":"This is just an absolute wonderful place to hang out.  Met some friends there yesterday for brunch and I can't wait to go back. The grounds were beautiful! Surrounded by trees and lots of shrubs almost makes you feel like you're not in the desert. The food was delicious and they also have an ice-cream shop. Staff was super friendly. They have separate restaurants. One has more of a cafe feel as the other is a little more upscale-maybe for dinner. This is on the top of my list of favorite places to hang out, relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"Cute place and super welcoming environment. We had brunch and the weather was perfect and we were able to get an outside table. The patio area is very charming and tranquil, great to just sit out have coffee and enjoy a meal with company.  We had the Spaniard omelette and the burrito bomb. Unfortunately our meal did not have a y seasoning and even with the salsa it was bland.  We also had a blueberry muffin and a soy chai, those were great.  We would definitely do a drink and a muffin again, but sadly the food did not hold to the charming location standards."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance and the food at Luci's.  I love smoothies and the green tea smoothie was delicious and hit the spot for something cool and soothing.  The food is very good and the prices are decent for what you get. Depending on the time of day, the parking can be very limited.  I wish Phoenix had more of these places that have amazing ambiance and great food!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  Awesome healthy selection and fair r prices with a great ambiance.  I knew Luci way back in the day and she always had a great flare to make things happen.  This is perfect for any appetite all day long with fine dining in the evening.  We ordered a cross selection of foods and deserts,  all were exceptional."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting. Great idea. But the food is just OK. We sat on the patio and nearly got eaten alive by flies. So many flies that we got an arm workout trying to shoo them away. Excellent setting, but they need to work on better food."}
{"text":"Had their featured drink; the pink drink (strawberry, lemonade and something else) and it was great! The entire complex is super cute, it consists of the brunch/coffee shop cafe area, the ice cream shop, (what I think is a) full service restaurant, a huge courtyard, fountains for kids to play in and an area to rent out for parties. The brunch/coffee shop cafe area is perfect for getting a good brunch, for getting work done or just relaxing/hanging out. I would definitely come back here as I love the atmosphere and all the random knick-knacks that are sold!"}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum.  Enjoyed a lovely lunch on the patio and some good convo with a friend.  Service was spot on and loved being able to shop all the non edible goodies!"}
{"text":"A family favorite for breakfast! This place is totally legit and if you desire healthy and delicious, this place rocks!!!!!!! Love the juices, smoothies and everything they have for breakfast!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me say that the Orchard is a super cute space.... unfortunately, Luci's was hugely disappointing. It's a counter service place with long lines on the weekend. The vast majority of the clientele are families with young kids, which is fine, but maybe not my scene. Anyway, we waited in line... The husband ordered oatmeal.... you know, nothing crazy. I ordered an egg sandwich on a bagel. We both got coffees (a latte and a dirty chai).... The prices were high, especially for what you get (5$ for oatmeal....8$ for egg on a bagel). We waited a long time for food.... apparently you have to pick up your coffee from the counter even though they give you a number for your food to be delivered to your table. We thought all would be delivered and were not listening for our drinks. When I went to investigate... one drink was on the counter... somewhat cold.... the other was missing completely. I asked for the drink to be remade, which they did without issue. The chai was subpar, far too sweet... I couldn't even finish it. When the food was finally delivered, we were disappointed to see the oatmeal was a bowl full of hot water with oats at the bottom. The water had not absorbed into the oats. When the husband inquired about this, the employee said that this was the way the oats were when they were very hot. Well... this was not acceptable. We returned the oats and they refunded the money (the right thing to do). The egg sandwich was nothing special.... just an egg and cheese on a bagel. Definitely not worth 8$. I can get amazing egg sandwiches in no less than 3 other places for less than 8$. Although Luci's business practices are sound,  I would not return to Luci's because the food and drinks are just not good."}
{"text":"My single regret is that I didn't discover this restaurant sooner, I have been missing out!! Do you know how hard it is to find traditional chilaquiles made with tortillas? Super hard. They were incredible! I cannot wait to go back and try more, their burger looks incredible! Their menu was so versatile and had things to offer everyone! I got their iced tea which was great, but I wish I would have tried their coffee! They all looked really great!  The whole environment was so fun and fresh, loved the outdoor area! Great for groups of all sizes and I loved the fun items in the market inside. This place reminds me of Le Grand Orange...but better... oops, did I say that out loud??"}
{"text":"Fabulous ambiance and even better food. Yummy little spot tucked away in a tree-shaded courtyard."}
{"text":"I absolutely ADORE this place. It's close to home and tucked away in a residential area so it feels cozy and friendly. The landscaping is beautiful and creates a green, shady ambiance. There's a splash pad for the kids and quirky, adorable gifts and trinkets to explore inside the store. The food is great and the whole place has a very relaxed vibe, a good place to meet up with someone to sip coffee and chat. The parking lot in the back is deceptively large, there is actually a fair amount of places to park. They also do a fantastic job with special events! My brother and his wife had their rehearsal dinner there and the outside area was transformed with lighting and seating to create a very special atmosphere for the celebration. A lot of other reviews seem to be docking points for the lines. To be frank, this is not a super huge restaurant and it has become very popular. It's not that they are being slow with food and drinks, it's just that there are a lot of people ahead of you. Worth the wait if you ask me."}
{"text":"We returned to Luci's for a second visit and had a much better experience. Two people asked to start our drinks while we waited in line. I made modifications on one of the salads to make it vegan and the salad came out correctly! The ice cream corner of the store had non dairy sorbet which was awesome. My son enjoyed sitting outside after dinner and watching the kids play. While it wasn't nearly as busy as my first experience (so, not an an exact comparison) it was still light years better than before. Food does take some time, which only seems long because with line-ordering you feel like it should be as fast as a pei-Wei or something. Really it is about the same time as your average sit down restaurant. Which is fine. If I could grant a wish I would add a vegan option to the menu, but I wish that for everywhere ;)"}
{"text":"We meet friends at Lucy's about once a month for breakfast. The atmosphere is great however not kid friendly. If you have children that you have to keep in constant eye on it is not the place to go as the perimeter is open to the main street and the parking lot. The only suggestion I would have would be to put a fence around the courtyard to make it a more kid friendly environment. A little pricey but you are paying for the location and vibe"}
{"text":"Such a great place to have brunch, meet a friend, or have a business meeting. The quality of food and drinks is what you'd expect of Luci's. The wait tends to be ridiculously long, so don't show up hungry.  Overall, a great place if you've got some time and want to eat and relax."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambiance. It's set up where you order your food at a register and it's self seating. The flowers, trees and lighting make it intimate and perfect for casual meals. Monday's and Tuesday's they offer pizza and a bottle of wine for $20. I will definitely have to come back.   I ordered the Spaniard Omelette and my partner got the biscuits and gravy. Got our food within 10 mins of ordering. The omelet was flavorful and not spicy considering it has chicken chorizo. His biscuits and gravy were hot and the gravy was so so..   Definitely a go to place for brunch soon with my ladies and pizza and wine :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Luci's and I immediately fell in love with her charm.  The outside seating, lush vegetation, cute splash pad and scattered table were adorable. Loved the darling store part where everything I saw was tempting to buy.   I found the staff to be knowledgeable and sort of friendly, but not overly so.  Not sure what it was exactly, but just the overall vibe didn't say \"we are thrilled to be here and glad you have joined us\".   We ordered a sandwich and salad to split and did appreciate that they split the sandwich for us and gave us each some potato salad.  We sat outside which looked nice, but we were almost immediately attached by black flies. There were so many that it became impossible to eat because we were just trying to shooo them away.  That was a bummer.  The club sandwich was beautifully presented and flavorful but a little hard to eat.  The chop salad had lots of ingredients and all were fresh and delish.  I got an Arnold Palmer ($4.00 or more) and was a bit disappointed when I was told they would refill the tea part but the lemonade was extra. Really?  After I just paid over $4.00 for a cup with lots of ice in it the first time. I felt like it was baseball stadium pricing.    I would come back for sure because the ambience was spectacular, the food was good and I am thinking the flies were just temporary."}
{"text":"This is such a great cafe! I would never have found this place unless I was invited by my friends. Food was delicious and price was sorta pricy but nothing exorbitant. I would definitely go back again and again and also tell more people about this place!"}
{"text":"It's really nice outside, but no pets inside, not even to allow you to order. Same sandwiches and foods as the other Luci's, just with an outdoor area that is better."}
{"text":"The setting for this place couldn't get better. It is like an oasis in the desert. The food is always good here. Inside is a little cramped, especially if they are busy. I had a very hard time finding salt and pepper or getting the attention of an employee to find any either. Took about 20 minutes and finally the couple next to me offered theirs. I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast, brunch or lunch!! The staff is also very friendly every time I go in."}
{"text":"This place had me from the outside - absolutely gorgeous manicured grounds with outdoor seating, a small splashpad for kiddos, and shade galore. What a beautiful spot. But, the unfriendly service, lack of available product for breakfast, dry unpalatable scones, and atrocious flies put me off. I am especially glad I'm not allergic to nut products ... I ordered a chocolate smoothie and took a few sips only to find it was loaded with peanut or almond butter. That was a big surprise - not chocolate at all. And nowhere did it state that nut butter would be added. Staff needs some training in customer relations, friendliness, and food preparation. BTW - only one bathroom per gender and it's way too crowded for that. There are many other cute places throughout the valley to meet up for breakfast."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite breakfast spots. Service is good. Food is awesome. Indoor and Outdoor seating. Great place to spend time with friends or a business meeting. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I loved the original but since the parking is a zoo it made it a seance to visit.  This is at The Orchard near my home and where I grew up around the place as an orchard.  It has terrific funky stuff in the store that can keep you occupied for a while.  Then the coffee drinks, smoothies and sandwiches they make are incredible.  I love, love, love the mango smoothie.  Then take it outside to the lawn and enjoy the sunshine.  Kids playing in the splash pad and folks having dinner next door or enjoying the frozen treats.  It is a fantastic place and a real refuge in Uptown Phoenix.  I can't wait until they get some yoga on the lawn there because that would be AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. I came on a Sunday afternoon with a friend and had a fresh juice and the chilaquiles. I was very impressed with the space.  There is basically 3 or 4 restaurants in one space! I was less impressed with my food though. I'd like to try the other eateries in the orchard."}
{"text":"So, my birthday breakfast with David was at Luci's, a place I've been wanting to try out for some month now. Walking into the grounds was phenomenal, and entering the restaurant portion was awesome. David ordered the traditional breakfast, over easy, and I ordered the corned beef benedict. After getting cups of water, we waited on the beautiful park-like grounds and waited for our food to arrive. And waited, because we were both quite hungry. So by the time our breakfasts arrived, we both dug in. To lukewarm dishes. While the flavors were there, the missing heat made it hard to truly appreciate our meals. We finished our food and let it digest a few minutes before leaving. Sadly.  While it may have been a fluke that our food wasn't brought out hot, it has hampered our desire to return anytime soon. Don 't get me wrong, I do plan on returning. Just not certain how quickly that will happen."}
{"text":"This place was way too ridiculously crowded. You should avoid on weekends. It is really a great space- 5 stars for the concept but there is no place to park and it took 20 minutes on line to order food. I guess this is a weekday, go early, type of place. Maybe over the summer when places are dead but then it would be way too hot."}
{"text":"Our family (4 adults and 5 children) met at Luci's at the Orchard on Sunday around noon.  This was our first visit to the Orchard location, and we were not disappointed.  Although the place was busy, service was prompt and the food was excellent. I can personally vouch for the Morning Run Burrito and  Sweet Fig and Tuna Salad Wrap; no complaints.  The kids had a great time as well.  I read some reviews that were critical of the service or displays, but I saw no evidence of shortcomings in our visit."}
{"text":"You have to give credit where credit is due. Went to Luci's on a Saturday, and a busy Saturday at that!  I had never seen the line so long (and I've been there many many times), but it moved very swiftly.  That wasn't what was most impressive.  The fact that our food came out within 15 mins during the busiest I had ever seen it was so impressive.  Incredible food quality, so many different seating options (inside, outside, rocking chairs, wooden lawn chairs, etc), and the service is always friendly with \"small town\" vibes.  Glad Luci's is doing so well."}
{"text":"Great premise. Great location and feel. Ordered 2 burgers medium. Came out like hockey pucks well well well done. Tomatoes were not ripe and zero taste.  Ordered muffins for my daughters... girl grabs them without tongs or gloves. I don't care if your trying to just touch the muffin wrap... that's a big no no.  Grabbed a few beverages from grab n go. Asked for cups with ice... girl stared at me almost as if she were being insulted.   Like I said.... the place is wonderfully appointed and has a great vibe... the service and burgers... not so much."}
