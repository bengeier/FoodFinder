{"text":"Michael's Bar was the first bar I went to when moving to the Cleveland Area and looking for housing on the West Side.  Turns out that it's not the closest bar to my house....yikes.    Food is pretty good here.  I enjoy his wings, $5 mussels (simple keep in mind), the pasta dishes are great, sandwiches are good, but understand that this is a bar / restaurant not heavily advertised nor does Mike truly care how outdated his menu is, his lack of a happy hour, so-so music on the juke, and his late 70's decor.  He will be the first to tell you 'Eh, it is what it is' in his Italian accent.    I like the place for a few reasons.  Mike is always there and he is always happy to see new faces.  They have photo hunt and I can ALWAYS get a seat.  Mike's GF Joyce is also usually bartending with a quick witted comment to all the regulars that grace their presence on a daily basis.  But most of all, they know me, like me, and it's comfortable in there.  As stated before, there is a juke and there is some good music on there, just have to look.  Lots of Sinatra because even if he doesn't admit it, Mike is a huge fan.  There is a pool table in the back too.  I think he has a dart board but its not put up, just need to bug him about that.  He occasionally makes some of his famous popcorn which is from a real movie theater style popper.  He has nice size tv's in each corner and will always have the game on.  I personally made him a hockey fan during the playoffs.  If you are tempted, stop in, go for some wings and try a pasta dinner or one of his sandwiches.  I personally like the turkey, mushroom, cheddar or swiss melt.  Sit and play some music or try and beat the top score of photo hunt, the names should contain jeff/alison/thomas or something like that, although he may have reset the game.  If that's the case, we'll see you at the top sooner rather then later."}
