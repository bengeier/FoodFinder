{"text":"I wish i could tell you all about the food but there was problem. My friend and went there for dinner we were seated quickly unfortunately it was in middle of the empty dinning room so we asked to be moved to the side which we were. Upon sitting down we were told we could only have one of the very small table tops there were two together so the hostess told us the manager said we couldn't use two table tops in the empty restaurant. So we got up and left. With the manager chasing us blaming the hostess for the the ridiculous action. Needles to say we will never return."}
{"text":"Great New Mexican food! Being from New Mexico we are picky and hadn't found a great place to find our loved Hatch green chili. Yes, really like the food here, give it a try!"}
{"text":"It was alright, not bad, but not amazing. The atmosphere is cool for sure. Was a little surprised it was Mexican food. Seems like people attend in very large groups. Service was a little slow but I have to attribute that to the mass amount of large parties. Give it a try, if anything, you'll like the design of the place."}
{"text":"I have dined here four times and have never been disappointed.  The restaurant is charming, with old toys and gas station signs.  We have never been disappointed in the food.  French fries are extra crispy.  The hamburgers keep hubby wanting to go back, along with the red and green chile.  They are very accommodating for dietary needs.  We have tried several of their specialty coctails, so far all really good and unique.  You can taste the talent behind the food.  The service has been great too."}
{"text":"Just tried this place and we loved it. The decor was great especially since my husband is a classic car guy. He had a great burger and I had some chicken tacos that were delicious. We will be back and bringing our family. Thankful it is so close by."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Great service Everything i've tried on the menu is excellent . Dan is the man!!!"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here for lunch. The food was delicious. My husband got the shrimp tacos. They looked and smelled delicious. I got the taco combo which was one beef and one chicken taco. Both our orders came with rice and beans and those were just as delicious as the tacos. The salsa had the right amount of heat and the chips came out hot. Our server Sierra was so nice and attentive. We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Great new place to stop for a burger and a beer...or whatever fits your fancy.  Food is great, service is even better.  Hubby & i will definitely be back and recommend Slick's to our friends.  Great place to stop for a bite after a movie or trip to the ballpark."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour before Mariners spring training game...Lauren was great!!!she recommended the Re-Tread....but we got the quesadilla which was great we will get the Re-Tread next time as we saw it come to a table next to us ....great atmosphere...friendly and great service"}
{"text":"Had the french dip and a cold beer. Nice staff and food. Been there a few times now and will continue to atop in for a bite and a cold one!"}
{"text":"Heaven, my stomach thinks it's in New Mexico. The staff and manager are super nice and the place is clean. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place!  I had the fish tacos which were amazing.  We loved the funky atmosphere decorated with old garage decor, an old Harley in the middle of the restaurant and Tonka trucks on the table.  Our server was super friendly.  My only complaint is that it's too far from our home."}
{"text":"Great service. Great atmosphere. Many options on menu. Burgers and enchiladas are bomb. Love the fries."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and atmosphere.  Will be back. Thanks to the Slicks Garage staff for making the winning Cubs game fun!"}
{"text":"Taco salad was good. Interesting decor, could not decide if it was a bar or restaurant. Different than what we are used too."}
{"text":"Great find!  Such good food. And they had good drinks and great music and a fantastic waitress too!  We each had something different and we loved everything. Favorites were the habenero lime margarita and of course the green chile fries!"}
{"text":"Had the three enchilada lunch and thought it was the worst ever. Flavor was way off and presentation was just a bad. Want Mexican food, don't go there. Loved the ambiance though."}
{"text":"Burger was clearly a frozen patty. Very over cooked. Very dry bun. Hard to choke down without ranch. Service was pretty terrible also but the waitress was trying... I won't be back. And the only reason it was 2 stars was because she gave a good effort but was obviously not cutting it."}
{"text":"What happened? This used to be my go-to for a terrific Reuben sandwich. Now they are using pressed pastrami lunchmeat with the corners sticking out beyond the bread. Smothered in thousand island dressing and sauerkraut. I won't go back and won't bring my friends anymore. Yuchhh."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. Good food - good proportions. What set this place apart is the staff. Best service we've had while in Phoenix. A definite for those who like a smile, good food and to be treated like a friend not a customer."}
{"text":"I loved all the old stuff and big signs it was just amazing looking place the food was unbelievable very good will go back again just to let everybody know you got to try it you'll love it"}
{"text":"My family and I are thrilled to have a restaurant in  \"restaurant row\" as I call it (83rd Ave just south of Bell Rd) that has a variety on the menu! We have eaten there several times now and  have tried several  different items on the menu. From the appetizers (chips and chile con queso is amazing) to the main menu (burgers are awesome, Reuben is amazing, tacos are amazing and the fries are the best we have had anywhere! ) everything is awesome! The atmosphere gives you a lot to talk about. Nostalgia all over the walls, the bar is definitely worth sitting at, with its very unique style! And, we had excellent service!  This place has something for everyone!  So much to choose from on the menu. I highly recommend this place.  You will not be disappointed!

{"text":"The first time we dined at Slick's we had fabulous service (Victoria) and good food.  The drinks are just average or below average, and are very weak and over iced.  While I know it is tempting to serve \"doctored-up\", flavored cocktails in low volume glasses full to the brim with ice, there is a price to paid as many of us know the difference.

Restaurants that do that aren't really fooling as many people as they may think.  

All in all, though, we liked the place because of the New Mexico food items. 

So we returned only a few days later on a Saturday night, and this time things were not as good.  The place was a morgue at 5 PM.

I ordered, again, the shredded beef burrito plate, and asked if it could be smothered in red chili (like in New Mexico).   But when it arrived it had way less, rather than more, red chili.  I asked if more chili could be brought to the table, and it was only when I volunteered \"of course I'll pay for it\" that a small side dish of chili was brought (for $1.75).   Finally, I am eating the burrito and find that it is full of potatoes (not like the all-beef one I had had a few days earlier).  And the small bowl of beans on the side of the plate were not warm (making me nervous about safety).

After mentioning to the pleasant and friendly waiter that I did not get what I ordered, he said they don't have a shredded beef burrito.  So I showed him the menu and that it was right there at the top of the burrito list.  That was when he stated he had gotten no training at all, seeming to blame the management for his lack of knowledge of the menu items and how they are served.  If it is true that he had not been thoroughly trained, then I agree with him.  This was not his fault.

To the management:  Look up and figure out \"service recovery,\" and get your consistency and staff training up to speed or, soon enough, you will be just another restaurant statistic.

We will be glad to give you another chance, but so soon after opening (only two months), and already having big problems with staff quality, training, and cooks that cannot get the food out of the kitchen hot, you are in for a financial bath if this is not fixed pronto.  

I will happily update this review after another visit, if that experience warrants it.

We hope to get our New Mexico \"fix\" frequently at Slick's for years to come.  Peoria has so few good restaurants other than all the mediocre chains, so we are pulling for you."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the food is great! I love  the New Mexico hatch chiles, great flavor! Service is very good. I would recommend this place highly!"}
{"text":"The food is good, atmosphere alright I like the decoratiins, not really garage like but kind of cool! We had a burrito was really good. The wife had a sub. Over all great time."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall. Burgers and sandwiches are amazing, my son got the breakfast burger and inhaled it!  The New Mexico type Mexican food is good if you like typical New Mexico style and very very large portions if you get a burro. Cute place, good service, will probably return but will stick with the burgers and sandwiches."}
{"text":"Today was \"Support your local small business day\", and as previous restaurant owners ourselves, this is one of the  'invented holidays' we 'celebrate' and take seriously. We had read so many great reviews about \"Slick's Garage\" and tonight seemed like a great opportunity to see for ourselves.
And we were so pleasantly surprised! The staff was personable and kind and fun to talk to. I ordered Chicken Fajitas, which arrived at the table (literally!!) still sizzling and sputtering with live heat; the onions and bell peppers were beautifully charred and so flavorful, not half-raw, lifeless and without any charm like I sadly and disappointed have had to send them back in most of the big \"chain restaurants\", where food most often is being placed in front of the guest without having even been tasted by anybody in the kitchen. Not here! You can tell that whoever prepared our dinners knows how to cook and LOVES doing it. Todd greatly enjoyed his \"Tonka Melt\" and is recommending it to anybody who loves \"comfort food with a kick'! We are already planning to take friends and family members to \"Slick's\", when they come to Arizona. Our dinner and our evening were an all-around delightful experience  -- (last, but by no means least!) thanks to our charming server Alex G. and one of the partners who stopped by our table several times to chat. We truly recommend this gem of a restaurant wholeheartedly and are reminding that we really don't need a special day to choose a great and charming local small business over a anemic and (usually) boring chain restaurant... I promise you will not regret your choice! M?ra & Todd"}
{"text":"This was such a great experience.  Beautiful food,  delicious, and great staff.  One of the owners waited on us and suggested the Reuben for my husband and I had the green chile enchiladas.  Best ever.  Come here if you are anywhere close by.  We are coming back tomorrow before we have to go back to Utah."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop place. 
Had the Club and French Dip. Pretty dang yummy. And not ordinary. Little unique additions make each sandwich just that much better. A chef that takes the time to make a familiar recipe his own is a chef worth visiting. 
Dan was a pleasure as a server....Welcoming without being obtrusive. 
Just a very, very good experience with some tasty food. 
Did I mention they brought out refrigerated ketchup? Extra touches that really make this place stand out.  
We'll be back for sure. You should also."}
{"text":"We love this place! Food is delicious, music and atmosphere are great, and our server, Dan, is freakin' awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is a fun, new restaurant & definitely worth trying!  The place is decorated with :garage\" type memorabilia and is fun to look at. The menu is named after garage type terms, very clever. Good size menu, priced in line with other area restaurants. The food was very good, the service, excellent. The 4 of us had a turkey Reuben, shrimp taco's and 2 of us had burgers. My burger was too well done for my taste, but it had good flavor. Our waiter, A.J., is also an owner and he gave us the history of how they came to Peoria. They also have an outdoor patio which will be fun to try when it's cooler out.  We will definitely go back and would recommend to others to try. Nice to have a restaurant of this type in the West Valley!!"}
{"text":"From the outside this small spot is behind an Italian restaurant.  Once inside, fun vintage car themed with a fun funky patio.

As far as the food, yummy bar food- green chili fries are a must!  We love the potato skins too.

Decent habanero lime margarita with tang- not spicy at all. 

Friendly attentive service both times."}
{"text":"Customer service good and the people were very nice. But there was a strange vibe to the place, the pop music really didn't fit the image of the place at all. My burger was very over cooked and dry  with in hours I had a bad case of food poisoning. That's taken me a few days to get over. There's nothing like throwing up for 12 hrs!"}
{"text":"Great decor. Great menu. I had the shrimp tacos, they were good. My kids had hamburgers which they said were good. They really loved the French fries. We would totally come back to this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a pain burger, came as a bacon cheeseburger. OK cool. Good portion, good taste. Hubby ordered chimichanga and enjoyed it as well."}
{"text":"The service there is HORRIBLE extremely OVERPRICED!  If you run a tab - DOUBLE CHECK - 2nd time there we were ALL charged more than what we actually ordered!  The staff there definitely made us feel like it was such a HUGE inconvenience to even be there - most of them were extremely rude and very unwelcoming."}
{"text":"We come to the arrowhead area for its great food options.  We happened to see this place pop up on yelp and noticed they offered New Mexican food with real Hatch green chile.  We are originally from NM and miss the food so we had to try it.  I will tell you this is authentic and tasty NM food.  We enjoyed it and will be coming back.  I had the combo enchalatas with green chile and it was excellent.  All the food was very good including our kids meals. Plus the whole car theme was cool, our kids loved that they bring hot wheels to the table.  Also our service was excellent too.  And the prices are reasonable.  I would give 6 stars if I could.  Our new favorite for sure."}
{"text":"First timers...

Staff was great, helped us choose from the menu and gave great advice.  My husband got the double barrel burger and I got the shredded beef sopapillas.  First it took a good RP minutes to get our food.  Not bad but everyone else already had food, not sure what took too long.  For the food,  Burger was good, but needed more sauce.  When we asked for a side it seemed like a inconvenience to the server ( there were 3 servers and only 2 other tables in the whole pace).  The extra sauce helped a lot!!  The beef and potato sopapillas were good, definitely had a kick!! The fries with green chili and cheese were awesome!!!  The one thing I hate more than anything....waiting 15+ minutes for the bill!  I would have given 4 stars but this is my pet peeve.  The servers all standing around talking, at this time we are the only table in the restaurant. 

We will try again, but same service issues and I won't be back.  Too many options in the area.  Food was 4 ... experience was 3."}
{"text":"One star bc 0 wasn't an option. We went to try a new place in the area. What a disappointment and waste of money. 
More than an hour wait to get out \"fast\" food. 
Once we received the food it was terrible. Overcooked . No flavours. Cold fries. The au jus tastes like dirty dish water. Although we complained and we missed our movie nothing was done about it. We definitely will never return. 
Manager is a joke.

Reply
The quality of the food was so bad 
The bread was hard 
The au jus tasted bad 
Almost no meat in the sandwich 
Cold 
Overcooked 

So besides the hour wait anything that could go wrong with the food went wrong. Seems like you have kids in the kitchen that do not know what they are doing. 
After complaining to the manager nothing at all was done. So how do you actually pride yourself? 
We are not a fan of chain restaurants but their quality of food is better. Sad! Constantly hoping this area will have more independently owned and good restaurants."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner on Sunday night.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door. Jeff immediately took our drink order and chatted with us about the menu. I had the Tonka truck. Great flavor, the addition of the chili pepper rounded out the burger.  It was spicy but not ridiculously hot. The fries were crispy and tasted great. (I appreciate the burger and fries were hot I had to wait to eat them) my wife had the chicken guacamole taco plate. Again great flavor piping hot from the kitchen. Portion sizes are perfect we even brought a bit of both meals home. As a bonus they had my one of my favorite beers Firestone 805.  Thanks for a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have authentic New Mexican Cuisine, and Super Good Burgers. Not just a bar, more a restaurant the whole family will enjoy. 

Slicks is also family owned and operated and it shows with great service and a staff that puts the FUN back into dining out. This is what Peoria, AZ has needed for a long time. 

Now for the FOOD FUN! I told you this is not your everyday run of the mill Bar/Restaurant, the Carne Adovada Plate  is super good and smothered in a sauce with just the right amount of spice.

Feeling like some Fish Tacos...Grilled, blackened shrimp, and topped with Baja sauce, could be your new Taco Tuesday Fave! (And they don't skip on the meat, enchiladas and tacos are loaded)

Now for the burgers...there called Banging Burgers for a reason.

This is Becky's Fave....It is actually called Becky's Breakfast Burger \"go figure\"! If you like Eggs on your burger, you're going to love it!

The Hot Rod is why Slicks should be on the Best Burger map for AZ! A burger topped with hatch green chile, carne adovoda and fire sauce. Amazingly Good!

Tonka Melt - This is a Patty Melt on steroids! Finally a restaurant who knows how to toast Rye Bread with the perfect crunch, and make sure you get a side of green chile fries!

THANK YOU SLICKS GARAGE FOR FILLING A NEED IN PEORIA, AZ! A FUN PLACE TO HANG OUT, AWESOME SERVICE & STAFF AND SUPER GOOD NEW MEXICAN FOOD ~ CHEF GREG REILLY"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to see for ourselves and THIS PLACE IS LEGIT.  The welcome was sincere, interior is awesome and the servers were great. Feels down home biker garage-Y (a word?!) and super comfortable (think: stay all day. YEP!).  The menu is GOOOOD and when we finally decided we were super happy with the results. The burgers are REAL HERE! Hot, juicy and loaded with an AMAZING bun to top! The \"Servicar\" Sammie is equally awesome for those looking for less than a big, beefy burger. 

I could go on but will end with JUST DO IT.  This is a new fav!"}
{"text":"We had the nachos and the potato skins. The nachos were kind of dry and difficult to eat because they did not stack the ingredients on the chips too well. And the potato skins were dry as well. Nice staff though."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to praise this place too much in case it gets too popular, but it deserves to be. This was my third visit to Slick's Garage ( on this occasion I was waiting out having my motorcycle serviced around the corner ) and decided to drop in for a drink and some appetizer with my bestie. We were warmly welcomed by Dan at the bar and immediately asked what we'd like. ( AJ took over from Dan after his shift was over and was just as awesome ). This has been the case each time I've come here:  from the moment you walk in the door you're greeted as if you're a returning buddy. My friend and I each had an Angry Orchard, nothing too strong as I WAS going to be picking up my bike in about an hour, and opted for the nachos.  A heaping helping shows up and they are pretty damned good. 

The decor is as you might imagine: great old placards and license plates on the  walls from various places around North America, awesome vintage toy trucks, tractors, service station signs and prints everywhere, in addition to a great old NYPD motorbike in the center of the place. It feels like the kind of place you'd frequent in your neighborhood after a long day at work, or after an enjoyable motorcycle ride. 

This is becoming one of my favorite \"go-to\" destinations. I HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!   You want a family friendly as well as family owned restaurant....this is IT!!!  AJ has been the face of this place since we have been coming here and he is SOOO welcoming and friendly you cannot turn and try to find another area fave!!!!  My wife, daughter, and of course myself have been coming here since they opened and have tried everything on the menu between us...our neighbors also have raved and been regulars as well....it is a neighborhood fave!!!!  They specialize in New Mexico fam dishes and have pretty fiery dishes! We love to see Megan whenever we can however her hours has changed but AJ is a fixture and is ALWAYS welcoming and will make your dining experience INCREDIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great went on a Tuesday had the wonderful 2.00 tacos and was surprised to see they were full sized and full. Heading back in a day or two got to try the enchiladas for sure. 
Thanks guys for a really good dining experience

New evening we're back agin it was that good  seriously it's not your average restaurant it's better if your familiar with hatch chili I suggest you give it a try"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is super fast and so delicious. The Dip Stick which is pretty much a french dip was delicious and probably one of the best I've ever had. The bread tasted fresh and just crispy enough. To end my meal I got a courts delight (huge cookie with ice cream on top) and it was amazing, I could've eaten the whole thing myself if my friends would've let me!!! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great staff great venue all in all a cool little place great patio.  The food was above average with good flavor. Good portion size. Good value for the price."}
{"text":"Seen some bad reviews , they must be really uptight eaters ! We just left this place a few minutes ago and i must say this place was awesome ! We are in town for spring training and we where ready to feast ! We had a party of 8 , 5 kids and got a table with no wait time ! The food was awesome , i highly recommend the green chili fries ! And the service was 100% thanks Carrie A for taking care of us"}
{"text":"great service....a bowl of green chili stew...good flavor not too much heat...just right...willl be back :)"}
{"text":"I have gone here at least once a week, for the past 4 months, mostly 2 times a week. I always recommend this restaurant, even to complete strangers. The food  is amazing. No matter what you order, you will not be disappointed. My absolute favorite are the french fries. I have never liked french fries before this. The service is great. Jacqueline, Alysa, Alex, and Payton, are great servers. The owner will do  above and beyond to make her customers happy."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor! Cheese enchiladas aren't your typical cheese enchiladas - they have a nice kick to them and amazing flavor. Husband has had three different hamburgers there and has loved every single one. You have to go there."}
{"text":"Aj is the Greatest!!!  He makes the best mules ever! Tried the peach & mint mule... let's just say I had three"}
{"text":"This is a nice stop off. The customer service is very good and they are up for \"fruity\" or \"stiff\" drink suggestions. They also have a nice selection is appetizers."}
{"text":"We stopped in here after a spring training game in march 2017. The staff was excellent and friendly. The food was fantastic. A fun atmosphere indoors and out. A good selection of beers and and mixed drinks with great food to go along with it. The location is super convenient if your catching a game at the Peoria sports complex."}
{"text":"We took our 6 year old son to celebrate his birthday this past Saturday evening. He loves cars and trucks and we couldn't have chosen a more cool place to celebrate than Slicks. He loved the basket of cars the waiter dropped off at the table for him and his sister to play with while we waited for our food. The service was stellar.  They all went above and beyond to make the dining experience memorable and the food was delish. I had the tortilla burger and was very pleased. The green chili fries were amazing. They celebrated my sons birthday with a warm cookie and ice cream and a trip to the hot wheels machine on our way out. We will definitely be back!  Thank you Slicks for making my sons day!!"}
{"text":"Carne Adovada plate was very good, bordered on great ... couple tougher pieces, but the hatch ciles, green, we're plentiful, homemade flour tortillas, excellent potatoes and pints round out the playe. JUST THE New Mexican fix I needed.  Looks like a great place to take the guts for drinks, too. Fun garage themed environment. Will be back, for more Slicks food and drink."}
{"text":"Very cool new place.  I've only visited once, but I will be back.  The staff is very nice.  I ordered the taco combo, one chicken and one beef.  The chicken taco was very bland, but the shredded beef taco was delicious!  I like the mix of items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Good service. Food was good, had a Radiator Burger. Disappointed that it's advertised as \"HOT\" and it wasn't even spicy.  I like the fact it wasn't loud or over crowded."}
{"text":"Group of 5 friends met up here for dinner, great band, food and atmosphere awesome. Mexican/ burgers. And beer"}
{"text":"In from out of town, and service could not have been worse. Waiter seemed to be the only one working, and he forgot to send our order. Had four kids with us and they were very patient, but saw multiple tables served while we sat waiting. Manager when approached blamed his waiter, and a good boss takes the blame. Go somewhere else, do not waste your time here."}
{"text":"Fast service, amazing food and great band! Would definitely recommend. Alex is an awesome waitress!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Pork wasn't great - kinda bland. Beef enchilada w green chilies was v good. Decor is v fun. Nice chill place."}
{"text":"This place was just not impressive for the prices and quality of food.  Ordered a burger that took forever it seemed like and it was okay.  The fries and the chile fries left a lot to be desired.  Wait staff were polite and were on top of refills, in that respect the did a good job."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is awesome, the service is prompt and incredibly friendly and the prices are on par!

Seriously, why aren't you here already? Do you love burgers, with a twist? Do you enjoy New Mexican cuisine? Are you a fan of happy hour? Wanna watch the game? Need to escape the loud, obnoxious vibes elsewhere? Then. Get. Here!"}
{"text":"Greeted immediately and had excellent service. They gave us a few recommendations and the food is amazing. Hubby got a double barrel burger and I got a chili relleno plate. Food was hot and fresh. We will definitely be back and recommend it to others. Love that it's owner operated we love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"If good New Mexico style Mexican food is your thing then this is the place for you. Very good Chili Rellenos tater skins. Ms. P ENJOYED the burger and fries. No Onions in the Guacamole! YES! I never could figure out why a lot of places put something as strong as Onion in something so delicate as Avacado."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Always interested in trying something new. The wife had a chicken and bacon sandwich and said it was the best sandwich she'd ever eaten. I had the philly cheese steak sandwich. It was good. I'll try a hamburger next time I visit there. I've always been on for the best philly cheeese steak sandwich. They are better back home, but this one was good. They had dipping sauce with it. That made it better."}
{"text":"Big up to Carrie A that girl took good care of us on our visit from so cal the past weekend! Food was amazing Carrie was badass and I still wanna steal that shovelhead in the center of the room but it wouldn't fit in my to go box!. Don't pass up this rad spot!"}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and entertaining.  The shrimp tacos are to die for.  The green chili soup is spicy and full of flavor  and unlike any I've ever had.  Service can be slow but sit at the bar and it's always quick."}
{"text":"Gave Slicks a try.  The place was 90% empty on a Friday night.  Never a good sign.  We weren't greeted and turned to get out of there before it was too late.  The owner ran up to us and was super friendly and asked us to sit anywhere.

We spoke and ordered drinks and an app.  The waitress came out and we asked for waters when our drinks come.  Time goes by and the drinks and apps don't arrive.  The place is dead so it should be pretty quick right?  Finally the drinks come but no waters or app.  

We ask again for waters.  The app comes.  No waters.

So we ask again.

The app is gross, bad salsas and guac.  We are looking at the menu.  Wishing we left.  

Finally a water shows up.  We ask for the bill.

Nice owner.  Terribly ran joint.  Wont be back."}
{"text":"The environment was awesome the food was gross I had the bucks club not sure how you make a nasty sandwich but it was gross, my hubby ended up returning his bucks club and went with the quesadilla which he said was not good. First time and was not impressed."}
{"text":"Very fun place! Drinks were good, the potato skins were SO GOOD. We came here on a whim after other plans fell through and it was a great decision. Our waitress is so nice and the cookie dessert is too good to pass up. I'll be back again! Also, the appetizers were $6. DEAL."}
{"text":"The other night my friends and I went to check this place out and we were very presently surprised at the great food and service! The green chili reminds me of being in New Mexico, but being here in the Phoenix metro. My friends enjoyed their food and drinks as well. The manager was very nice and checked on us to ensure that everything came out as we expected. All I have to say is it was much much better then our expectations. We all will be back and very happy that we made the dinner choice to try this place! I would suggest it to all my friends and family. Plus the manager was warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere and food. Found Slicks Garage and now a frequent visitor. The staff is friendly and the owner Raina is great. The burgers and Mexican food is great among other options. They have fun specialty drinks, love the Big Sexy. Definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"So. Worth. It.

My family is from New Mexico, and I am no stranger to the 'Burque or its one of a kind cuisine. That said, I truly appreciate REAL hatch chiles, and this place has 'em and boy are they good.

I have been here about 3 times and each time was delicious. The carne adovada burrito bowl with green chile is a perfect meal and the burgers are delicious. My only complaint is that the AJ's burger which is wrapped in a tortilla should be grilled like a quesadilla to crisp the tortilla a bit. Other than that, the music, the service, the fries, the green chile and the even the desserts are excellent. 

I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome! My family and I tried it for the first time last night and we will definitely be returning. 
The wait staff were outstanding, have great customer service, always checking to see if we needed anything else.  The decor is really cool too.  You need to try this place out!"}
{"text":"First visit. Only had drinks but will be back for the food. Friendly staff. Food coming out of the kitchen looked awesome. Decor was creative and unique. We will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"We found this through Yelp and my dad, being a car and motorcycle enthusiast wanted to give it a try...I'm glad we did!  

The atmosphere is great, clean, upbeat and full of things to look at while you eat. 

Our table had the Studebaker Rueban which got a thumbs up, the Gyro...also great and the carne adovada, which was delicious.  Great portion sizes and very tasty!

The waitstaff was very attentive and always ready to help.

Great little spot!"}
{"text":"Got into Phoenix late and of course we were hungry so asked at the hotels front desk where a decent place to eat within walking distance was.  They said this was good food and close by so we decided  to give it a try.  We didn't realize that it closed at 10:00 and I think they were trying to get people to leave even though it was only 9:00

First we were seated and given menus after standing at the hostess station for about 5 minutes.  Should have been a clue for us.  Not many people there on a Friday night, should have been another heads up.  We waited and waited and the I must admit that the wait staff seemed totally disorganized and seemed unsure of which tables were theres.  Finally a man came and asked if we needed silverware, our response, we'd rather have a server so we could order.

So after sitting for 20 minutes and unsuccessfully trying to get the attention of a server, one showed up.  We would have left but didn't know where else to go given we were tourists and it was dark and we didn't have a car.  I ordered a steak salad and my friend ordered a taco salad.  We got drinks and even though there were just a few folks eating, it took another 20 minutes to get our food which was ordinary at best.  My steak was tough, hardly any greens, no bread with it, boring and tasteless.  The taco salad wasn't much better according to my friend.  

In reading some of these five star reviews, I continue to wonder if we ate at the same place."}
{"text":"Waited 40 minutes to be seated almost 40 minutes for food. If I could give this place zero stars it deserves it. Screwed up my friends dr. Pepper order and gave him root beer. Will I be back to this place. Maybe after Jon taffer rescues it"}
{"text":"Great establishment.  Excellent service, excellent food. I had the shrimp enchilada with half red and half green sauce.  Green sauce is spicier  (to my liking). Go their  and enjoy."}
{"text":"I work across the street from this place so I thought I would give it a try. I like places like this that are not big chain restaurants. I had the enchilada combo that came with a chicken, cheese and beef enchilada and a side of black beans and rice. I ordered it Christmas style so I could try the red and green sauces. The portions were excellent and the food was tasty.

I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the sauces should have had more of a bite. They don't need to set my mouth on fire but I like a little sweat starting on my brow half way through my meal when I am eating New Mexican food. 

This looks like a neat place to have some drinks as well so I will have to come back when I am not working and try some other items."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The bar tender Karla was very nice. Grilled fish tacos are the best I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating at Slick's Garage today for lunch.  The place was clean and smelled good with great music at the \"right\" volume playing.  We decided to eat on their secluded patio which was a great choice, partly shaded and on two levels.
Our server Jason, greeted us and told us about his favorites on the menu.  He got our drinks promptly and then gave my Sister and I enough time to read through the extensive menu peppered with New Mexican dishes, all available with red or green chili sauce.  
Jason made the Carne Adovada sound awesome but I chose the Enchilada combination plate with roasted green chilis and onions.
The plate was served hot and with a side of seasoned pinto beans and Spanish rice, garnished with fresh diced tomato and shredded lettuce. One enchilada each of Shredded chicken, shredded beef, and cheese enchiladas smothered in rich green chilis cooked with onions, to say this was delicious is an understatement!  It was as good as any enchiladas I have ever had anywhere in New Mexico!
 Jason was an attentive but not obtrusive server.  He checked regularly and was quick to answer our questions and to get a to go order of the beans, they were that good!
We finished our meal with the Sopapilla'swith cinnamon sugar topped with vanilla Ice cream, carmel and chocolate sauce.  decadent.  It was presented cut up in small triangles which made it easy to enjoy and it really topped off our meal.
We met AJ the assistant manager and he wan cordial and very helpful with suggesting catering options they had for an upcoming baby  Sprinkle my sister is planning.  Their Patio is secluded and offers semiprivate seating for parties and get togethers.  Weekend afternoon's seem like a great time, there was a group there setting up for a 3:00pm baby reveal party when we were there.
I could go on and on about this place, but will close with a simple recommendation to give this place a try, and of you have a family gathering coming up consider their taco bar not the patio too!
One last thing, they had nice clean restrooms too!"}
{"text":"The basket of Hot Wheels and toy cars for the kiddos is a brilliant marketing ploy -- my kid loves it. The food is fresh and flavorful. Great value for the price. Been twice and had great service both times. Even with sauce the chili relleno was crispy. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Wow! Loved everything about this restaurant. On the menu your food choices vary from hamburgers to enchiladas. There is so much to choose from. I had the Studebaker Ruben and my husband had the Tonka melt. Both awesome dishes. We came during happy hour where wine was three dollars and my husband had a beer for 3.50. The staff was outstanding and friendly. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and look forward to coming back and trying other things on the menu. Seriously, if you are in the area it is worth stopping in and having a burger, enchilada or even a taco. Don't miss out."}
{"text":"This is a really funky and cool garage themed tavern and restaurant. We came on a Friday night at 5pm and it was just starting to get busy. Their buffalo cauliflower is a must to order as an appetizer and their Reuben sandwich is delicious. Their fries are coated with a crunchy outside and I'd order double next time! Their staff of guys worked their butts off and I'd recommend anyone stop by here to try out their menu. Fun place!"}
{"text":"This place won't fix your car, but they will definitely fix your hunger with some great food, that focuses on a New Mexican twist of hatch green chilies. Atmosphere resembles a classic 50's garage with cool automobile memorabilia, to include gas pumps. Each table has salt and pepper shakers in antique toy trucks. Mine unfortunately was missing it's rear wheels, so I had to play with my food instead. I had the Radiator burger with their amazing green chili's sauce and their green Chile Frys.  Don't pass this place up. Fill your tank at the garage"}
{"text":"First time customer last night. The inside motorcycle decor adds to the welcoming atmosphere. The menu is extensive with protein choices. I ordered the Junkyard Burger, the patty was juicy and well seasoned. I requested the bbq sauce on the side, big mistake on me. The bbq sauce is delish, next time i will ask them to drench the burger with it. I had some of the green chile too, that can go over everything. The booze menu had lots of choices too. I had the Cilantro Margarita, it was well balanced the bartender was on point. Alex our waitress was courteous and attentive.  Good service, welcoming atmosphere, and delicious fresh food."}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant! Great food! The best green chile in Phoenix. I had the carne adovada enchiladas, and the were amazing. Reminded me of my time in New Mexico."}
{"text":"Fantastic Time! Ian and A.J. really took care of us. Great atmosphere as well as customer service. If you get the opportunity stop in and grab a burger and beer. Try the Oak Creek Nut Brown Ale!"}
{"text":"I think this is a great little addition to the P83 area. It's something you don't see much of anywhere else and that is dishes with a New Mexico twist. That pretty much means LOTS OF GREEN CHILI'S. Or just Chili sauces in general. They pretty much give you the option to put red or green chili on any of their dishes. And I just happen to love both red and green chili on just about anything myself. So I can for sure see myself coming back for more. Not to mention this place has such a fun and quirky kind of character to the décor inside. Mostly filled with gas station, and motorcycle/car garage type of gadgets. There is even a huge motorcycle in the middle of the dinning area. On my way to the restroom I poked my head outside to get a look at their cute patio area around back and I noticed there was a little hidden spot where there was a kind of small party having food and drinks hidden away from everyone else. Seems like a nice place to possibly have a private event. I would say this place is just filled with fun little surprises like that all over. 

I ended up settling on the Garage Punch. It had Deep Eddies Sweet Tea Vodka and black berry. It was super refreshing. I followed that up with the Shrimp Bowl Shrimp Bowl:
Blackened shrimp, black beans, cabbage, cilantro, tomatoes and Baja Sauce. Also very refreshing. The Spicy flavor of the shrimp topped with the creamy Baja sauce could not have been more perfect. This dish was also the perfect size. I was not overly full but it didn't leave me wanting more either. Our server was very friendly and on the ball, even with many other tables we saw him taking care of. All together we really enjoyed our time here and glad to have a new spot close to home."}
{"text":"Impressed for first time visit. Friendly prompt service, family run . I had the Radiator Burger it was Fantastic-Delicious. Looking forward to next visit to try new item."}
{"text":"Ground beef tacos are amazing, beer is cold! Our bartender has always been very kind and assertive! Highly recommend coming out and trying the food and booze!"}
{"text":"Fun vibe, friendly staff, but the food is not good. Half of our food was incredibly bland, while my fish tacos were way too heavily seasoned, while lacking in any other flavor. Three stars for the decor and live music, but the food was more accurately a two star rating, and... hubby and I both had upset stomachs the next day."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and service was super rad! The workers are so nice and attentive ! Will definitely be back so glad we saw this and decided to try it out ! Can't wait until the live music and all that fun stuff happens in the patio area ! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Interesting establishment. The reason for three stars. Personality of staff. Very friendly and knowledgeable about the food fusion from New Mexico. Now as far as the food. Unimpressive. Might be back for a bar crawl or before taking in a movie. Not beyond that."}
{"text":"Thought we would try this place it being it is fairly new to the area. Food was fantastic!!! Had the Double Barrel Burger and the Chili Rellano dishes. Recommend them both!! Staff was great too, friendly and knowledgeable about the place and menu. We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the decor and the red chili. However the service was lacking and the \"vibe\" you get from customers and staff when walking in was awkward to say the least.  When we ordered drinks off the menu, the bartender came to inform us they didn't have some of the ingredients, then proceeded to state the drink is sweet enough without. That's a small insult to those who create the menus, in my opinion. Unfortunately, there was little interest in the bartender to make up for this, even something as small as offering her expertise as a bartender to concoct something else for the other customer I was visiting with. Last issue was the price vs meal. For nearly $11.00 for a \"Chicken Bowl\", you're served a plate covered in lettuce and small portion of rice and chicken. This meal was nothing short from an over priced afterthought.  Sadly, this native New Mexican will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's hard for a restaurant to nail all the points but Slick's does. We came in with a party of 17 including 6 kids and couldn't have chosen a better place. The atmosphere was awesome. They had kids menus, coloring pages and hot wheels which kept the kiddos entertained and the parents happy. The service was incredible (Megan rocks!!!!). The drinks were delicious  (I had a jalepeno Marg, my husband had a huge cold IPA). The food was good. Between pur entire table we almost tried everything on the menu. They even had vegetarian dishes. No complaints. I wish we had a Slick's in the east valley!"}
{"text":"I love the idea of a New Mexican-themed burger/bar, but Slicks fell a tad short. Paid $2.00 extra for green chili and cheese fries and got a very very small portion - luckily the manager noticed and brought us an additional plate of more fries. Burger Was over cooked. Service was good. they have potential to be great, but not there yet"}
{"text":"Great waitstaff.  Decent food. Great beer selection.   The old school garage decor is tired and uninspired."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this a higher rating because of the food but I can't.  Where to begin.  We stopped in around 1:30 and it was not that busy, perhaps six tables occupied and two servers working.  An employee told us we could sit anywhere we wanted and someone would bring us menus. The music in the restaurant was on the loud side and not very enjoyable. The selection being played was a male singer screeching at the top of his voice, barely better than Florence Foster Jenkins.  We debated whether to get up and leave but we wanted to try the New Mexican food which we hadn't had in a long time.

Anyhow, back to the service. About 10 minutes after being seated our waiter brought us our menus. We ordered ice tea and the beverages were brought to us right away. My wife and I decided on our selections and then came the wait.  It took in the neighborhood of 10 - 15 minutes before our waiter came back to our table to ask if we were ready to order. We could see him on the other side of the restaurant not doing anything in particular. He would occasionally give us a quick glance and then look away or go tend to his other tables.

My wife ordered the Sopapillas and I ordered the Carne Adovada Enchiladas.  Our orders were brought to the table in a reasonable period of time.  Our waiter set the food in front of us and then turned around and decided to engage a customer, that was leaving, in a conversation right at the edge of our table. If you ever tried to eat a meal with their rear-ends practically in your face it's not the most appealing way to enjoy a meal. When it looked like they were going to camp out there I had to clear my throat loudly to give them the hint to move on, which they did.  

At about this time a minor rush came into the restaurant, 3 groups. We were about half way through our meal and the waiter had not stopped by to see how we were doing. It would have been the last time we would have seen our waiter if my wife hadn't flagged him down as he was passing by our table and we had to ask for refills on our ice teas. (What was also interesting at this time is the three groups that came in had several children with them and all of a sudden the music reverted to a much more typical background music you would expect at a restaurant. I don't know if someone was playing a personal favorite when we first came in or the sound track had a few really bad selections.)

Now onto the food.  Both my wife and I really enjoyed our selections. It was exactly as I remembered when we ate a really good restaurant in Albuquerque several years ago. The portions weren't huge but we were not left hungry at the end of the meal. The waiter came by and collected my plate when I had finished. My wife finished her plate a few minutes later and pushed her plate to the edge of the table. The waiter's attention was now solely focused on the new tables he had to wait on. After 10 - 15 minutes my wife and I got tired of waiting for our check so we stood up and waited by our table which is when I'm assuming was a manger came over and asked if we were waiting on our check. Our waiter then got the hint and brought our check to us.  

We are not sure if we will be back. The food was very good but the waiter was not trained very well or unable to multi-task."}
{"text":"The food is amazing - I love spicy and so many restaurants dumb down the spice - this place does not and it is a savory mildly hot flavor.  This is a family owned restaurant with a father who knows his way around a business and a garage and a wife who has an amazing talent for the restaurant business and spends her time on people, process and being a chef.  Their son benefits from both their skills.  They are from Montana and have been in the restaurant business for decades.  The food is amazing, the service impeccable, and the atmosphere is fun and friendly."}
{"text":"I picked this place to meet my friend who races dirt bikes and fixes them. It's on the P83 - 83rd ave south of Bell road by the spring training complexes .
We couldn't remember what restaurant used to be here but no mind. 
It has a garage theme. Old timey signage and auto themed dishes like: The Re-Tread, Studebaker Rueben, Gas Hog burger, Tonka Melt, the 409,
The Dipstick just to name a few. So American style burgers and sandwiches, soups and salads are covered. 
If you like Land of Enchantment aka New Mexico style food, Slicks can hook you up with fajitas, chimis, enchiladas, tacos and burritos. The shrimp tacos I had were flavorful and not skimpy. My gear-head friend got the same and gave it a thumbs up, when he wasn't shoveling it into his mouth. They were gone too soon. We wished we had more room to try something different to double our food tasting experience but were pretty full. We each had a beer. Jason was our waiter and he was attentive. Great service. 
Pleasantly surprised and I will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Here for a business lunch.  The staff is awesome, menu looks appetizing and it smells great!"}
{"text":"Three visits. I teetered between 2 and 3 stars. I chose 2 for these reasons..

Amazing decor. Amazing patio. Clean. Friendly staff. 

Food is average. Imported hatch chiles? Bullshit. Not spicy. They taste like the weak \"hot\" canned hatch chilies I get at Fry's. Only bean option is whole pinto, no seasoning, and chipotle's are better (I'm a bean fanatic). First visit I had the carne abodova(spelling?). Was awful and could not eat. Second time I only had a beer becuse I didn't want to waste money on more lame food. Third time I (reluctantly) went to a birthday dinner here for a friend who wanted to try a new place. I ordered chicken enchiladas, which were probably the best thing about this place..but I prefer the competing restaurants of the areas' better. Margaritas are good if they ever come out from behind the bar..

Service. Holy crap the service is awful. This was the reason that I chose 2 stars instead of 3. Such awkward and clueless serving. Order 3 of the same drinks at the same time, have 3 different servers deliver them. Well after waiting 15 min for first one, another 5 minutes for the second one, and ANOTHER 5 minutes after that, for the third. Wtf? So weird. Beers, people. Beers. Not even some handcrafted stuff. Even delivered wrong beers that NOBODY at the table was ever drinking, and we were on our second round of (of 4 people drinking). Empty restaurant and the food takes 30 mins. No concept of \"separate checks\" even though we stated this before ordering a single thing. Slow service, and don't expect someone to check up on you. I'm not picky when it comes to service, but this was just so awkward and bare minimum service"}
{"text":"Love this place! We have been coming here since they opened. The owners Raina and AJ are so friendly and make everyone feel welcome.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and the food is outstanding. We have taken several friends here, and now all of them are regulars as well."}
{"text":"Always good food, always great service. All the employees are super friendly and smiling. Try the Burgers and the Burritos."}
{"text":"Extra star for great service and cool ambiance! Food was pretty good. I had a side salad-meh. and the green child Soup - Yum! My friend had the chicken guacamole tacos which she said were really good. The iced tea is pretty gross but overall a nice place to hang out w friends or the fam!"}
{"text":"Good heavy portions of chile-spiced food. No green chile & egg tacos/breakfast burrito though. They should change that"}
{"text":"Super cute place... lots of charm! food is delicious ... burgers sandwiches and Mexican dishes all great!!! From unique little trucks sitting on the tables with condiments to gas pumps of childhood memories! Outside patio... great service and good home cooking food!  This place offers a nice little sit up bar with TV... booths and tables all in a casual atmosphere. Old time coke machine, traffic signs..: hubcaps and more trucks for decor with a NY Buffalo police motorcycle that is the center attraction of the dining area. Great place to chill and talk about the good in days!!!  Has patio with music during cooler months...  their Guacalmole rocks!!!!! Mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and stopped for lunch. Sat at the bar and Brenna was our bartender/server.  She was absolutely fantastic! Personable and a pleasure to get to know. We had enchiladas, an adovada burrito and the habenero margs. Great meal and an awesome experience! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"So nice to have a non-chain restaurant with charm and excellent tasting food in the west valley! Rare gem on the west side!"}
{"text":"I like this place & the way the manager/owner's son has always made us feel welcomed & comfortable. The food is very good & the restaurant is kept clean."}
{"text":"The red and green chile here is really good. 
Looking forward to coming back and trying the rest of their New Mexican dishes. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We read all the reviews before deciding to go to dinner here.   

Let's start with this is a BAR not a restaurant.   

It's loud and noisy.   The food is absolutely awful.  

For example, our large party had the fish tacos, burgers, carne asado layered enchilada, Philly steak sandwich & a vegetarian meal.  

None of the food came out together 

The burger was dry
The vegetarian meal came out incorrectly...sent it back and it came back with a half-hearted attempt to remove the item that we asked to have held off.  

If this had been a food allergy.   This would have compromised the health of a diner.  

Wait staff had bad attitudes. No cross helping   Snotty.   

Could not give you one reason to eat here."}
{"text":"We just left this place no one acknowledges you we waited there too long and left . Guess no one is working today. Bad service...."}
{"text":"We were in town for Spring training.  Stopped in for a burger.  Pretzel appetizer was delicious.  The husbands burger was a 5 star item for sure.  Kids meal of chicken strips was a hit as well.  Unfortunately I ordered from the Mexican portion of the menu (Guacamole chicken tacos) and would not recommend, very bland and basic.  Great restaurant if you stick to the burgers and bar food."}
{"text":"Met Dan the man today very nice guy that atmosphere is awesome the beer was cold and we had there Chile Rellenos that was also Awesome he did turn us on to a sample of there green chili stew which if you don't already know by now that to was Awesome So if u r looking for a place that has a great feel and a very nice menu check it out this was my first time there but will surely will return"}
{"text":"Love this place! First time here and love the place, the people and the spicy Spanish Pork! Try it. So good!i I will be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered a taco and cheese enchilada. Taco was on homemade shell. Delicious, not your normal enchilada. It's a stacked tortilla shell smothered with green chili, really good. Husband had a sub sandwich ,he could not finish it. Big and good. Server, Meghan was excellent and on the ball. Good place for casual dining."}
{"text":"I have now been here 2 times and had the same experience.  Food and service are good, but don't come here in a rush.  Service, although good, is SLOOOOOOWWWWW and sometimes hard to get a hold of your server.  I liked the food I had, mainly the Sopapilla.  The Burrito my daughter had was also good.  My girlfriend's medium rare cheeseburger was cooked to hockey puck.  The chill's are good, as should be for New Mexican Cuisine.  

Clean and VERY COOL atmosphere.  All in all, I like it and would go here, but I don't think it would be my go to."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with my boyfriend and I was so excited to try it out after hearing such good things! I got an order of carne asada enchiladas and he got beef sopapillas. Both with green chile that is home made according to my server. Let me just say this restaurant is the real deal and is authentic New Mexican food! Food was amazing and I can't wait to come back on their \"taco tuesday\" deal. Service was very attentive and kind, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Slick's Garage is one of my new favorite restaurants. I can't put my finger on the genre of music they play, although I did recognize one Johnny Cash song. But it is a high energy type of music which gives this place a special vibe.

I had a bit of a headache when I visited these guys so I just wanted some comfort food and decided to go with Becky's Breakfast burger. I'm a sucker for eggs on my burger. It also had tomato, lettuce, bacon and a hash brown patty with a delicious bun ( I'm guessing it's an egg bun). The burger was ginormous and tasty. Unfortunately, I still had the headache after my meal but did enjoy it.

My dinning companions had the Chicken Tacos with guacamole and the Club Sandwich. A two thumbs up were given and our service was spot on. It's obvious that Slick's hasn't been discovered yet because the crowds were not overflowing when they should have been on a Friday night. I can't wait to go back and try something new."}
{"text":"Slick's Garage Bar and Eats is a Fun New Restaurant that just opened in P83 across from the Peoria Sports Complex (where Satara Thai used to be). They serve mostly New Mexican Style Foods ( that means much of the foods offered include Red or Green Chiles) They offer Happy Hour Specials M-F 4-7, they serve bar grub, sandwiches, burgers too and more. The atmosphere is interesting it's like a fun Auto Collectors Style Man Cave. I saw a big Harley Davidson in the middle of the floor surrounded by lots of antique toy trucks. There are gas pumps, gas signs and lots of trucks and more. 

I tried a sandwich called a Service Car that translates to Turkey, Avocado, Green Chile, Provolone, Grilled on Sourdough Bread that includes a side. I have to say it was a DELICIOUS Sandwich! It was a tad shy with the turkey meat but those CHILE Peppers with the creamy avocado made this sandwich amazballing delicious to me. It was so tasty that I didn't lose a thing by leaving out the cheese. For my side I picked their house made potato salad and it was seasoned just right like it should be. They offered some other interesting sides like waldorf salad that I could have went with and a $2.00 extra option of Fries topped with chiles and cheese too.

My husband had the Carne Adovada Enchiladas. It more like a lasagna style New Mexican Plate. The Corn Tortillas are stacked like Lasagna. My husband got his plate Christmas Style with 1/2 Red and 1/2 Green Sauce. His plate contained a generous amount of nicely seasoned red chile pork, cheese and their delicious sauces with rice and beans.
 
We had a terrific lunch in a really fun atmosphere. I enjoyed looking at all the collectables. Service was warm and friendly.

I'm so happy another nice eatery opened in this part of town. This is another unique (not a chain)  restaurant that's just what we needed in this part of town.

Give them a try if your in the area if you like New Mexican Style Cuisine."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere
Food: very yummy
Drinks: very tasty!
Service: good
Patio: Pretty cool w/ corn-hole boards"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was rockin, and exactly what we expected. The service was prompt and handy at all times... But good lord that food was awful. The burgers were obviously frozen pre-made patties and very dry. The \"sautéed onions\" were completely raw. The buns were about an inch thick and dry too. My brothers chimichanga was cold and had zero flavor.
On a Saturday, they took the time and effort to drag their \"drink special\" sign out front leading us to believe our drinks were cheap. Low and behold they only offer drink specials on M-F.... So why did you drag that sign out there on a Saturday? To mid-lead us?
If not for the excellent service, this would be a 1-star review."}
{"text":"Ate there Sunday night and it was great. Good was delicious and service was fast and friendly. Couldn't ask for more really. Plenty of options on the menu. Definitely will be back. Not like the other chain restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Staff was attentive and engaging from the get go and the food came out hot. The New Mexican entrees are great and hard to come by outside of that state.  I highly recommend the Sopapillas... authentic with honey.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service from Dan! Can't wait to come back for the live music on Sundays!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today for happy hour
The wife had the gyro sandwich with a small Greek salad. Of course I tasted it. The Greek dressing on the salad was good, seemed house made. The sandwich was good, plenty of meat, enough tzekkei sauce, and the cucumber slices were a nice touch.
I had the chicken fingers and fries. Fries and fingers were better than average.
Great service, prices are reasonable.
Place is spotless."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate buying a house. My son called the restaurant and paid for our dinners. AJ was so helpful arranging that over the phone with my son. AJ even threw in an appetizer to help us celebrate. This personal touch is why we keep coming back here. (And the French fries:-) The entire waitstaff is super friendly and the food is so good. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"My first time was a success! I highly recommend coming in soon! Vintage look with signs, oil cans, cars and motorcycles everywhere. This place is really bad ass! 

I ordered the bobber burger with FRESH hatch chilies and cheese fries... holy amazing. Definitely worth cheating on my diet hahah. The Cajun style burger has caramelized onions, bacon, blue cheese (I replaced with cheddar) and some amazing sauce on a potato bun. Bomb! 

My server, Sierra, was great and cute! Always a plus :)

I'll have to come in for a beer sometime and check out the nightlife. My only suggestion would to have some sort of car show from time to time, that would make this place stand out!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, drinks are good, decor very cool.  So we decided to try the food on our last visit.  Soon disappointed!   Ordered the gyro, the worst we have ever had, only had a couple thin slices of meat, so not worth the Money!  We were bummed..."}
{"text":"409 sandwich was the bomb! Service was decent as well. I can't wait to come back. Very clean and simple restaurant and menu."}
{"text":"Had a little HH with Liz the bartender!  Excellent Cosmos. Poor girl got slammed with Metallic concert goers and she still kept up the pace!
Ordered the Servicecar sammie!  Excellent with green chili for an added punch!  Their Frys are awesome."}
{"text":"Ashley and AJ rock the joint! The inside is really cool and takes you back to the 1950's and 60's. The food centers around the Land of Enchantment  (New Mexico). Hatch Green Chiles and other well contrived dishes taunt the pallet. Great specials and $2 Taco Tuesdays entice me. 

Call and get the live music schedule. They have a killer outdoor patio that resonates jams and drinks! Tons of shopping and venues to take in when your done chowing. I say it is a must if you are in the area..."}
{"text":"Great style for a bar. Super nice waiter. Food was ok. The Grapefruit Basil Martini excellent."}
{"text":"First impressions are everything, Mr. Slick! My husband and I had never been to your establishment and so yesterday 3/21/18, we decided to try it. 
Walked in, a few people at the bar, a few people at tables. We get seated. Now mind you, it's coming towards the end of happy hour 5:40. We get our menus talk to the hostess who has no idea what the specials are or anything, so she goes and tells the \"3\" waitresses standing by the bar/beverage area, they look over. The hostess walks back over to the front door area. We shut our menus, still no one, (5) min now, we make eye contact with a couple of them, they look away. Finally, after 10 minutes and now only 10 minutes of happy hour left, we WALK OUT! We Tell the girl on the way out, \"guess you guys don't want our business\". She says absolutely nothing......whole thing was weird! Everywhere else was crowded, people waiting outside to get in. Hmmmm, now we know why this place wasn't. We eat out at least 3 times a week and live a mile away, However we won't be going back to Mr. Slick's Garage anytime soon!!

{"text":"Went for lunch here today for the  for the first time. Walked In And loved the decor .  Very eclectic and old school .  Unfortunately that was the end of my love with this place.  Ordered two beers and the Malibu bowl...don't know what happened to the bowl but for$10.75 I received a plate wth black beans. Cabbage, a couple of tomatoes diced, and a drizzle of dressing ???? And a very Small piece of some?? Kind of fish.... no lettuce ... no nothing ?? My husband ordered pork enchiladas and

got yesterday's leftover dried out meat !  Asked for water and after the second time she brought it... beers came dripping wet but had to ask for napkins ?   For $38..00 before tax n tip? I say skip this place!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place and were thoroughly disappointed with the food. The chicken quesadilla taste like canned chicken and the Philly bread cut the roof of my mouth. The kitchen was extremely slow with only three tables at the time."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but very slow. The restaurant was empty as it was 2pm on a Saturday. I ordered the Malibu Bowl and I would definitely advise to stay away. It was a pile of black beans and purple cabbage on a small plate with a pile of frozen mystery fish on top. I ended up sending it back and sharing my friend's entree. The bill came and the bowl I sent back only taking one bite was on the bill. I asked the server if it was a mistake and he said no his manager told him to leave it. I asked to speak with the manager and the manager never came. The server just ended up bringing the bill with the entree removed...so we thought. There was a \"service charge\" of $8.50 added to the bill. I went inside to find a manager only to be told she was cooking and unavailable. We ended up waiting another 10 minutes and a new bill was brought. All in all management and service charge as awful and would not recommend this to anyone. Stay far away."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Wait staff was slow and barley checked up on us. The music was loud and didn't match the decor either."}
{"text":"I want to start out with saying this. BEST NEW MEXICAN FOOD IN THE AREA! (Except my moms kitchen  We are from Albuquerque) HOWEVER, after rave reviews about the food from my parents, I decided to take my boyfriend here and have real New Mexican food. 
The service was terrible. 
Waitress barely came around (she was too busy with the other table, where she was hanging out the whole time) 
I asked for extra cheese on the side, and my boyfriend asked for a hot rod burger with bacon. She took forever to get our food, and when she brought it out, I had no cheese on the side so i has to ask her again, and my boyfriend didn't realize it till he was done with the burger, but it did not have  bacon. 
It was quite a while before she came back to check on us, and we are done eating at this point. 
We had been sitting there for a while (all while she was lingering at ONE other table with only a couple tables in the place occupied). So my boyfriend flagged her down and gave him his card. 
When he got the receipt to sign, he saw he was charged for the bacon he never got. 
I've been reading some reviews on yelp and it doesn't sound like these waitresses are trained very well and giving some bad service. 
I don't want to see this restaurant go to shit because of bad service. 
Again, if you have read this far, food is bar none, the best food ever and you should DEFINITELY come here to eat. But just beware service isn't great."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after Modern Shooting. Was impressed with the food.  It threw me off by surprise as I read the review and walked into an okay decor place.  I expected an okay dining experience but I had an amazing bowl and the waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Also, I am on a Paleo diet and so many choices."}
{"text":"This was the first time Amanda and I have been here. Our Server was \"Jeffy B.\", and \"Liz\" came out to make sure we were serviced while he was running about. The service between these two were AWESOME!, and we hope they get kudos for our service.

Our receipt shows:
Table: 102
Guests: 2
Receipt: 26646
Date: 12/13/17

PLEASE Make sure these two folks get our \"ada-boys\"."}
{"text":"Holy flavor!  We really enjoyed our dining experience!  Drinks were good, food was tasty, dessert was yummy!  Service was super friendly and efficient (despite what some of the other reviews say).  Ambiance was lively and there's so much to look at.  The burger was stacked high with carne adovada and green chilies.  The carne adovada plate had such bold flavor and was slightly spicy.  Neither of us could finish our plates.  The prices are very reasonable for generous portions.  Our server was very attentive.  Overall, Slick's Garage was a great experience and we will be back."}
{"text":"Drove by and saw a new place. I was pleasantly surprised! It was really really good! I love the decor, the staff was very friendly and made great recommendations ! Ask for Payton she was great!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the family. The atmosphere has a very cool small town vibe. The food is amazing.  Between the five of us, we all got a taste of everything, from the burgers to the Mexican food, everything was excellent! Dan, our server, was so attentive and very informative about the menu! Great service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Believe the reviews. Went for lunch and didn't really know what to expect from a place called Slick's Garage. Turns out it's a mix of american burgers/sandwiches and New Mexican food. Service was very friendly and place was clean. It's table service. The auto-garage theme is kitschy in a good way, with a lot of neat stuff to see on the walls.

I tried the Studebaker Reuben and added green chile and cheese to the fries. Came out hot and fresh, with a generous portion of pastrami and was grilled perfectly, no greasy bread like some places. I will note they used seeded (caraway) rye bread, which I loved, but some like my husband prefer unseeded. Overall, a great hot sandwich. For me though, the green chile fries were the star. Really, their green chile is so delicious. I could've eaten bowl of it. Can't wait to go back and try some of the New Mexican dishes or burgers topped with it. My husband ordered the gyros. It was highlighted on the menu as one of the house specialties so he gave it a go and really enjoyed it. The meat was so flavorful. I took a bite and wanted to share. :) Not sure if the meat was house made, but it sure seemed like it. The pita was toasted/grilled nicely, and the large thin layers of cucumber were a nice touch. At first glance the the sandwich seemed small, but those meat slices are fairly thick, and when you folded it up it was a decent size. Salad was fresh, topped with crumbled feta and dressing on the side. Hubby said it was all so good he'd order it again.

Honestly, this place is great. We really enjoyed it. It reminded me of what casual dine-in restaurants used to be before most of them went down hill in the early 2000s. It's delicious food, well-made for reasonable prices and with good, friendly service too. Highly recommended. We'll return soon."}
{"text":"We had a relaxed, fun, good dining experience on 05/23/18. There were few people in the restaurant at 6:45 pm on this Wednesday evening, which made us a bit skeptical but we were immediately greeted by Megan who guaranteed us a great dining experience. The service was excellent,  atmosphere very nice (music perfect volume), and the food was served very hot and met our expectations. 
I'd recommend skipping the same old chain restaurants and giving this unique restaurant a try.
5 stars to Megan and the staff!"}
{"text":"Great place!! Doing supper before the hockey game and decided to stop in based on previous reviews. We weren't disappointed. The burgers were delicious, the fries were awesome and our server Alex was a delight. And it was happy hour for drinks .... bonus!!!"}
{"text":"The service staff resembles a biker bar, although they are very friendly and attentive to your needs. The food is good and reasonably priced. 

I recommend the philly cheese steak. I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Outstanding food! Fantastic service! I almost don't want to leave a review because I want to keep this gem a hidden secret. But I want it to stick around. So I'll share. Meghan was phenomenal. She took great care of us! We will be back for sure!!  My husband is a New Mexican and he verifies that the food is legit! Sopapillas were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Dan is an awesome bartender! Great food and welcoming atmosphere!! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was not very good, tortillas were store bought kind and mine were not warm. For \"authentic\" New Mexican food I was disappointed, but the drinks were on happy hour and good so they got 2 stars for that. Probably wont go back since neither my food nor my husbands was good and both were menu stating top or popular items."}
{"text":"Terrible...waiter was non existent...another sever had to take our order...only 6 other people in the restaurant and a patio private group...who were buffet style from what we could see...the water tasted like toilet water so obviously not filtered from the tap...we ordered nachos and told they would be quick...after the second server picked up wee were already unhappy about our wait....wrong...and when they came out they were bland and tasteless..I could make better myself at home.. this was our second time to Slicks after the first time we left satisfied."}
{"text":"This place had pretty good food for bar food. We were seated and service was fast and the waitress was friendly. We had an appetizer of tortilla chips, guacamole, salsa and queso. I had chicken tacos. The chicken was very good and they give you a lot of food. My husband and daughter got burgers which were huge and came with a large side of their choice fries. The fries were really good and they liked the burgers. My husband got one with a bit of spice to it. The guacamole had a little bite as well. But it was a good heat. Overall not bad. For 3 people we paid 59.00"}
{"text":"Excellent Chile relleno, fries, burgers and wings. Friendly severs and awesome managers"}
{"text":"What a great new place to break up the giant chain restaurants in Peoria! Service was so friendly, decor so cool, food so good! 

My son LOVES this place- they give kids Hot Wheels cars to play with so keep them happy while they're waiting for the meal to come.

I've been here a few times, and EVERYTHING has been tasty- but a few of my favorites are the queso dip, AJ's burger (named after the owner's son), and the Pineapple cocktail... oh my god, it was good. And the fries? I'd kill my mom for some of these fries.

Go to this place! Go to this place now!"}
{"text":"Glad we found this gem of a restaurant in town. Food was delicious and the service on point. We enjoyed a great evening in the patio area which has a great atmosphere. We later learned it is locally owned and operated which explained the superb customer service!"}
{"text":"Slicks garage has the best Patty Melt ever and their fries are wonderful. Do not just drive by; stop for a great meal you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fantastic, fabulous menu, staff & ambience. Try to have a similar experience, soon. Unique in every way.
We tried it 3 x's in 2 days. Hard to choose what we liked best. I will say the chile relleno were the best I've ever had. Consider Laguna Beach we'd love to have you."}
{"text":"Carne adovado was very good but portions are small. Sandwiches were good as well but not special or exceptionally tasty. My wife did not enjoy the Chile Relleno too much batter and slightly undercooked. Beans need more flavor, rice definitely reminds me of New Mexico restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing place with a great environment. Excellent service and food. This place is kid and family friendly."}
{"text":"Wow for a bar,, the food was outstanding. i ordered the Carne Adovada Enchiladas. oh my goodness they were great"}
{"text":"Came early on a Saturday evening. We both got burgers, and found them extremely tasty. A sign of a great burger is flavor throughout the meat & that slap you silly it so freaking good charred crispies on the outside. This burger had both. And the fries were AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Well another boring tribute to the 50's with boring music and horrible food. Service is slow and don't be fooled by the busy parking lot. All the cars are for the other bars and pizza joint next door. If you want a boring night with warm beer this is the place to go."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of green chili (specifically Hatch green chili) then this is a place you need to try. I got the Radiator Burger with green chili cheese fries (can you tell I'm from New Mexico) and it was amazzzzing. The burger was perfectly cooked and was loaded with chili, they didn't scimp out. The fries were also overloaded with cheese and chili, so it made the $2 extra worth it. My husband and I also shared the queso, in my opinion it wasn't the best I'd ever had (still good), but my husband loved it. There were tons of options on the menu to please everyone in your party. Now aside from the delectable food, the music was killer. I was trying very hard not to sing along to everything that came on. The inside is decked out with a bunch of vintage signs, license plates, and old toy cars which gives it a really cool vibe and is definitely different from everything around that area. I'm a snob about going to restaurants in Glendale and Peoria, so if you don't go here you are missing out."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant because of the rating. Food was mediocre at best. Service was horrible and the place wasn't even busy at all. The waitress barely came to the table. At the end of the meal we asked about dessert. She had to get a menu because she didn't know what they offered and it was only two items. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great spin on Mexican food! My meal was delicious! I had the adovado burrito! My boyfriend had the adovado enchiladas and really enjoyed them too! We will be going back check out what else they have!"}
{"text":"Super cool place... nice to have something different than another chain in the Arrowhead area. The service was awesome from start to finish and our son got to leave with a new hot wheels car. They not only have crayons for coloring to keep the kids occupied but also a basket of cars for them to play with.

Then the food was real good too... we had the Carne Adovada enchiladas and Triple Decker sandwich. My wife really liked their fries. Was so much that looked good on the menu.

We'll be back often."}
{"text":"My husband and I split a Philly cheesesteak along with an order of french fries. They were both very good. There was one tough piece of meat in my husbands sandwich, which when the waitress saw that, she took off some money because that was a bad piece. The decor inside was very fun and gave you a lot of things to look at and talk about. This week we plan to take friends of ours there partly because he is a big enthusiast of old cars and their parts.  If the food was not good, we would not be going back this soon."}
{"text":"Service is great drinks were on point! Got our apps right away. played some corn hole and is a family-friendly and fun place . Hope the food is as good. more to come!"}
{"text":"Love this new restaurant! Atmosphere is fun, service was great and the food was excellent. 
There is something for everyone. Ordered the Carne Adovada enchiladas with green chile. So good. The patio is perfect for dinner or cocktails. 
Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal as well as the service. AJ and Meghan both ran a busy restaurant efficiently and with smiling faces. Will most certainly continue our patronage."}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE, Great happy hour,  Awesome staff.. Try the Green Chili Cheese Fries.... COLD Draft Beer Football & chive TV..."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm bummed. Thought I found the place of my dreams for New Mexico food. First visit two weeks ago was amazing. Tonight's visit was not good. Took an hour to get our food, and when my stuffed sopapias came to the table they went even warm. Got almost all the way thru the meal before I got the guacamole that was supposed to come with it. And to top if off the Carne Adovada was horribly dry and overcooked. So disappointing. Looks like I need to keep looking........

It sad because the potential is high, but it looks like getting a decent meal is hit and miss."}
{"text":"I'm originally from New Mexico so finding legit green chile in Phoenix is a challenge. A friend recommended we try this place and it was AMAZING. They have a large selection of New Mexican plates with green or red chile. The service  as awesome and the restaurant is really cool!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, very kid friendly and the service was wonderful me and my family will def be back"}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened I have been a regular customer. The food is amazing, the owners are welcoming, the staff is attentive and the prices are reasonable. They have a great Happy Hour, special events ... as well as weekend live music and Specials designed to fit the area demand. They all work nicely together and are a pleasure to talk to .... I have always had great prompt service and delicious meals. They can even customize some menu items upon request. I love the atmosphere and cool décor ... I will be a forever customer."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for alerting me of this new hot business. I took my mom here while visiting on vacation, she assured me she will now be a regular . 
Everything about Slicks Garage deserves 5 stars; from the service, decor, delicious food, tasty drinks, and ambiance. 
Our bartender Joe was attentive, friendly, and made sure to accommodate us. Mom of course wanted a chicken chimichanga and the menu called for beef. The owner Rayna was kind enough to make for Mom. She even came out to introduce herself and made sure we were pleased with our meal. 
I will make sure to visit Slicks next time in town. Of course Mom will be rubbing in how often she goes here!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero stars if I could!  Food was terrible I'm not sure how this place got some many good reviews.  Our server was clueless on most of the items on the menu. She recommended the burger.  It was well done and dry, shrimp tacos only had 3 pieces of shrimp and looked undercooked.  Kids meals are a joke.  I had a clear shot into the kitchen a watched one of the cooks rubbing his nose and not using gloves to pick up bacon! Maybe if your just wanting a drink, this is the place for you. The people who give this place great reviews please try venturing out to good restaurants so you know how gross this one is."}
{"text":"Love the environment, service, music. Didn't get a chance to taste the food but it looks and smells amazing! Great place for Sunday funday!!!"}
{"text":"Had the dip stick with green chili and provolone added. Also the green chili fries were great!"}
{"text":"Great place to explore New Mexican Cuisine fare (a.k.a. Hatch Chili. )

We try this out, we will come back, love the old motor scooters, my wife will not allow me to buy one .

Either way if you like good New Mexico type food this is your joint; this is our joint, hope to see you there, we will be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Huge menu, most of the food seems \"ok\". You won't be disappointed, but won't be blown away either. Had the carne adovada, was pretty decent. I'd eat it again. Mexican rice was decent too, though not as good as Macayos (which has awesome rice).

Is it worth checking out? Yes."}
{"text":"Love this place. The owner AJ is awesome and the food awesome....every single time! Customer service is one of a kind. Lunch or dinner, you can't go wrong. Great new hangout on 83rd Ave."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, nice outdoor area. The food and drinks were great, and service was nice, if a little slow. More than your average bar food, with some interesting twists. We'd go again."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. We came by on a Saturday night, parking lot is empty. That should have been a r d flag. We go in and I'm dying of thirst, it takes 5 minutes to ask for our drink order, then another 5 to actually get the drinks. Again, they aren't even busy. My iced tea was nasty. It tasted watered down. I exchanged it for a soda, fine. My husband I ordered 2 appetizers. A quesadilla and guacamole, chips, and salsa. 30 minutes later, still no food. Not even the guacamole chips and salsa!! Then we hear him tell another table it's because everybody showed up at the same time. The place was half empty, and nothing was coming out of the kitchen! We finally walked out, after 45 minutes with nothing but drinks in our tummies. Never going back."}
{"text":"Let's start with the service was excellent and it has a fun quirky atmosphere. Menu looked good with a wide variety of offerings. The issue we had was with the food. The chicken avocado taco was tasteless. The shrimp taco was a bit better but still could have used more spice. The food came out a piece at a time and his burger was super well done on one side. I will most likely come back since it really is a fun place and I want to try at least one more time."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour and had a couple of beers and the chili con queso.  The service was good, better than expected since they have only been open three weeks. One critique is that the ratio of chips to queso was unbalanced. There were too many chips for the amount of queso given. Overall, a nice new addition to the west side."}
{"text":"Just gave this place a shot. We will be back for sure! I had a hamburger, and it was delicious. Seasons fries were great! My little guy LOVES this place. They have him a basket of cars to play with, then when he was done tug his meal, he got to pick a hot wheels to keep! 

And, the service was wonderful.

A must try place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I only have given out a handful of five star reviews because I don't give them out very easily. You can look if you don't believe me. 
I was down in the area and decided to try it based on the yelp reviews. I am a huge fan of green chilies so this was right up my alley. Apparently they get large batches of green chilies which they prepare in house. 
The inside atmosphere was very cool with lots of neat stuff to look at.
Since I was alone I decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was friendly. After looking at the menu I decided to try their chili relleno dish. Instead of the rice and beans that normally come with it, I decided to substitute the green chili fries. 
Now I have eaten a lot of chili rellenos and these are absolutely incredible! Somehow they managed to get the outside a little crispy. They do have quite a kick to them because they are covered with even more green chilis. The fries are also covered with green chili sauce and were great. I think I had a little green chili overload.
Overall it was a great experience. I can't wait to try out some of their other food in the future when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to swing in on a Saturday around 5pm.  We were surprised, the place was pretty empty.

We were seated quickly and given waters and menus right away.  They have such a wide variety on the menu, we definitely took some time.

Out of a party of four, all meals came relatively quick and hot.  We were all impressed by the food and its quality.  Great flavors from all of the sandwiches.  Even the side salads were of high quality fresh greens, not just a simple salad poured from a bag.

Thanks for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"Hold the phone!!! Where's this place been all my life?! Very cool atmosphere with tons of things to look at including a motorcycle parked right inside. Great prices with huge portions. I talked with the waitress for a bit while waiting for my hubby and she told me a bit about the restaurant and that they are from New Mexico. They have the chilis brought in. I ordered the Carne Adovada Enchiladas with green chilis which I was told were spicy and most popular. Spicy is right. Very good, but a little too hot for me so I'll go with the red chilies next time. My husband ordered a cheese stake and it was amazing. He said he really liked that they toasted the bun so it didn't get soggy and that it came. We also had the quesadilla for an appetizer. The service was awesome. We left with our bellies full and the promise to come back again with the kids."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant with memorable flavors that will bring you back for more - time and time again.  Very fresh and delicious food that is distinctive enough to make you want to come back here for the same thing you ate last time. I can't wait to try other items on the menu. The tacos are awesome - so awesome That I was craving them again and ordered them the second time I was back. As previously mentioned in another review, they are crammed full of delicious high-quality meat.

I am so tired of chain restaurants where all of the food tastes the same - very mediocre. Slick's is a wonderful alternative where the food always exceeds expectation.  Grab some friends and head to Slick's for a wonderful experience.   It should have a line out the door all the time - but it doesn't.  So, go check it out NOW!"}
{"text":"Not  very good... the place was pretty much empty while we were there except for some people at the bar. 
The service was ok, food was ok but drinks were good. 

The setting is excellent. 
Probably just a hangout place but not a can't-miss place.
Worth a try but nothing more."}
{"text":"We came her on a Friday night, at first is was a little dead which didn't seem like a good sign. But we were pleasantly surprised. 

The burgers were hand made, fresh, delicious and the know how to cook a well done burger (according to the weirdo in our party that likes her meat slight burnt). The fries were good but a little salty. 

The ambiance is nice but a little loud so not the best place for those hard of hearing."}
{"text":"Stopped in to check this place out, lots to see in the restaurant. The beer was cold (a good thing), we ordered the re-tread; chips, salsa,, queso, and quacamole. The salsa was ok, need to sliced up, quacamole was fresh, also needed to be seasoned. Looked like you were getting a good amount of quac but it was on a bed of shredded lettuce.  We ordered the radiator burger the hatch chilis were good but not spicy at but the burger was good. We also ordered the Tonka Melt, this was a really good burger.  We were seated at the bar and the bartender continued to hover throughout our meal, it was difficult to eat or have a conversation while she stood there."}
{"text":"Greeter was pleasant and seated us right away. I had ordered a Arnold Palmer to drink and repeatedly had to ask multiple times for refills. Our server barely checked on us during our visit as if she didn't really acknowledge we were there.  Service is everything, it's what separates the competition. 

Food was good, nothing to complain about. But the service will not lead us back here. Disappointing as it looked like a great place to frequently visit."}
{"text":"the inside of the restaurant blew me away, you won't get bored looking all the things on the wall and center of the restaurant! My husband and i decided to give it a try we had the basic burger, it could use some more salt/pepper but overall was really fresh and juicy! Will be back to try something new"}
{"text":"I have had a few people tell me about this place and have read plenty of reviews to make me want to try this restaurant and i have been meaning to for a little while. Today i had that chance and i wish i have tried it earlier. The inside of the place has a good look to it, almost chain restaurant look and feel, exactly what you think a place called the Garage would have, but the food was not restaurant chain at all. Our meals were excellent, prepared hot and fresh with little wait, like a 10 min ticket time. We started off with the Guac / Salsa app and that was good. The meals we ordered were the Carne Adovada Enchiladas and the Chile Rellenos. Both of these dishes were amazing. They had great flavor and were seasoned just right with the perfect amount of spice. I have almost stopped ordering Chile Rellenos because most restaurants don't have good chile or prepare the chile properly, if you don't know what i mean by that, then you don't know good chile rellenos. This has to be the best i have had a long, long time. The enchiladas are layered, not rolled, and have plenty of pork. The red chile pork was cooked perfect and had a great flavor on its own. Both dishes are served with rice and beans and they are also very well made. The owner was in the restaurant running the show and she was also our server, that was a nice to have for a change. We will definitely be back for another go and explore the menu further. Great job."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place by accident looking for a new place for dinner.  The food was nothing to write home about, very Blazer and overpriced for what you got.  I liked the ambiance.  Maybe get a better menu.  Doubtful I would ever return there."}
{"text":"Amazing service.  The waitress was great and super helpful. More importantly the food....  WOW.!!The tacos were amazing and so we're the burgers. I also love the atmosphere. Such a cool place to hang out at. The menu has a lot to offer and looking forward to coming back to try more. Will add this to my list of favorites."}
{"text":"Slick's is one of our new favorite places to go! We haven't had anything we didn't like. Their green chile is authentic New Mexican style and it is SO GOOD!! Enchiladas are fantastic, burgers are fantastic, their happy hour is great too. We always sit at the bar to see AJ. He's wonderful. Thanks for a fun new place to hang in Peoria!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre from what friends said.  I ordered a salad and found a piece of plastic in it.  As I asked the server who then asked the manager, they just were too passive about it implying nothing was done wrong.  Although I liked the atmosphere, I may and may not give them another chance."}
{"text":"Average burger place but all the food was good! Atmosphere is very nice and wait staff was nice! Good overall experience."}
{"text":"This place was great. Good amount of food at a decent price, friendly staff, good service, I'd definitely recommend trying it."}
{"text":"We just moved in the area and checked out some new places. GREAT customer service, John and Alex made the experience. Fun atmosphere, good food and they have a band on Friday nights. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic so is the decor. Had the steak sandwhich which was very good with tons of peppers and onions. Also had the $2 Tuesday tacos which were simple but fantastic. Very different menu with lots of options and tons of green chilis."}
{"text":"I was visiting PHX and ran across this nice establishment on Yelp.  it was the day before Christmas and so maybe you can chalk this 3 instead of the average 4 star review up to an anomaly but I'm going to have to stop short of the 4 stars.  Was it good?  Yep!  Would I go back?  Probably, because the menu was pretty appealing.  But this visit the execution was just ok.

The menu is pretty great, diverse options of burgers Mexican type fare and American.  I liked the options, a lot of spice and a lot of normal options too.  I had the special breakfast burger which comes with egg and the works, and also tried the radiator burger.  The breakfast burger was done well.  Like too well.  It was dry and lacked flavor.  The burger overall was average.  The radiator burger, to get it spicey, is just COATED in a rub/powder that has the chilie flavor.  It overpowers the entire burger.  The fries were good.  My mother had a fantastic salad that they made just for her, I appreciated the service on this.  

Call it a pet peeve but I hate it when an establishment, no matter how good the service, doesn't ask how your food is.  

Overall again if I lived here I would give it another go - but I wouldn't go out of my way just for the cool atmosphere - and although they had a tv or two with a game it didn't really seem like an overwhelmingly good spot to catch sports either."}
{"text":"Not sure what is worse, the service or food. Nobody in the restaurant except people at the bar drinking.  Went here because they had good reviews, but was fooled."}
{"text":"In spite of some kitchen snafus, we love this place! Cool decor/atmosphere with awesome staff! Pretzel was goid but the chile chees fries were absolutely amazing and a must have. Their cocktails are delish with a decent beer list. Had the Top Fueler burger which was huge and filling but not as spicy or flavorful as I expected. However, my wife's Tonka Melt was killer goid! Must have on a repeat visit. Will def cone back n recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible queso lukewarm and no flavor. Then got the taco salad with chicken. Canned chicken. Very dissapointed tonight."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Everyone here is amazing . Awesome place if your on your bike and want to stop in for a drink or some amazing food. I work at headquarters and we all support each other. They refer so many people to us and we do the same for them. Please come check out slicks garage and all the smiling faces."}
{"text":"An \"accidental\" discovery when searching Yelp for something different, and WOW - I freaking LOVE this place!  

When you open the door - the place just oozes great vibe.  Our server, Meghan was a blast, and although I'm only \"home\" for the holidays to visit family - I will return here forever and ever.

Oh, the food?  Delicious and GIANT portions.  Can hardly wait to come back.

* I had the stuffed chicken quesadilla.  Juicy chicken, almost too much to eat (had to share a little).  And a side of pinto beans!  Wanted to dog a burger, too - but I'd already had an early dinner, so...next time  :-)"}
{"text":"Good food good service great decor. Support our non chain restaurants in Peoria visit Slicks."}
{"text":"What a gem!! This place was so good! Tacos and burger was delicious and they had some great cocktails as well. Music was on point! Really hoping business picks up, as we'll definitely be back and want to see this place succeed. Great quality food and an impressive menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the stuffed sopapilla."}
{"text":"Came here today with 2 work colleagues on their suggestion. Why eat at a corporate run place when you have an original mom and pop restaurant?? The decor is something out of \"American Pickers\" with the vintage signs and motorcycles as part of the biker garage decor which just happens to be right up my alley. Below are pics of the 3 meals we ordered. All were great. Will i come back again? For sure! When was the last time you saw vintage harleys at a Cracker Barrel??"}
{"text":"My new hang out.  Love Raina Mexican food  and burgers  great drinks  

I love their chips and salsa . Spicy"}
{"text":"I liked the old garage set up, however, much too expensive for food and drinks. I had one drink and a scoop of guacamole with chips. Came to over $17.00!!! Probably won't go back, just to expensive."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! So glad our friends recommended it. My only regret is that we didn't find it sooner! Staff was so nice and friendly and the food was DELISH! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super cute place! We came in late one night and they were very gracious (even though they probably wanted to go home) and provided great service. Menu has a nice variety, especially loved the fries with red and green chiles - amazing!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place. My husband had the Chile Rellenos. We were in Albuquerque NM many years ago and he had them there and loved them. He's never found another place that makes them the same till now! The Chile left whole and stuffed then fried with a coating and served crispy. He said they were fantastic. I had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich and it was delicious! Piled high with lots of roast beef, grilled peppers, onions and cheese. The bread was toasted perfect, still soft but with a slightly crispy outside. The au jus was very flavorful as well. Carrie was a new server and did a great job, she was friendly and attentive as were the owners. They have several great choices on the menu with green chilies from Hatch, NM. Lots of options from salads, burgers, Mexican food, sandwiches and bowls. We look forward to going back and trying more of their great food, there was so much that sounds amazing on the menu. The owner said they have live music on Friday nights. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Courtious, quick service and good food. My husband and I have been looking for a place like this near home."}
{"text":"Food and service just okay. It was close to our hotel. Decor was interesting. Wouldn't choose to eat there again."}
{"text":"The service is slow as other people have already said. It took about 5 minutes for a server to even come to our table for water. The food was not bad but really nothing to brag about. Pretty neat on the inside."}
{"text":"It was our first time in and we will be back! The food was delicious. The top fueler burger, tacos, and enchiladas were delicious. There was more than enough food. 
Our server AJ was attentive, responsive, and made wonderful suggestions. We came in a bit late and he did not flinch. Many restaurants will become upset with late customers but we felt welcomed by AJ. Thank you AJ! 

Overall, give this place a shot you won't be disappointed. Such cool decor in this place. At the very least we enjoyed looking around the restaurant at all the neat old garage paraphernalia."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Food is great.  We have been there 4 times and we only moved to Peoria 6 weeks ago!  Loved the chili relanno , pork enchiladas and V6 appetizer."}
{"text":"Went there a few nights ago with the family.  We were seated immediately - it wasn't busy as all.  Service was good, but a bit slow.  Everyone had a different item and all were good.  Standouts - the green chile was TO DIE FOR!  It is pretty spicy, but oh so good.  Burrito's were excellent, as was the cheese steak.  Overall, it was good and we will be back."}
{"text":"A new spot we ran across... very fun decor ... old cars, trucks and motorcycles.. menu has several items with Hatch green chilis .. I had the stacked enchiladas with green sauce and chicken .. very good flavor with good sized portions - beans were ranch style .. we will be back !"}
{"text":"This place has great homemade food and the service is top notch as well! Great specials and the atmosphere is very family friendly. I just wish I could eat more cause the food is on point!"}
{"text":"Just had their breakfast burger with ranch on the side. Delicious. I don't have any other way to describe it. From their fries to their home made from scratch ranch to their meat patty to the hash browns and fried egg that was in the burger. Just delicious. AJ and Alex who work there were very nice and sociable and approachable people too. If it's any indication to the vibe the rest of their workers are. Food was delivered timely I honestly don't have any thing else to say. Check these guys out if you like Mexican and American burgers for sure! 

Oh and give these guys a call if you're going to near their closing time because their close times are a little off. If that's even a bad thing go say."}
{"text":"Stopped in on way to the theater. Great casual environment. I could see hanging out here with a group of friends at the bar or on the patio.
Joe, bartender, super friendly and helpful with the menu.  I had the V6 quesadilla  which was delish! 
The extended patio needs to be finished, add bags or seating down below. Can't wait to hear about some local bands playing here."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! If you are interested in New Mexican cuisine, Slick's can't be beat! Service was timely at the bar and they aren't too crowded on a Monday night."}
{"text":"Tuesday night we tried the taco Tuesday special ground beef tacos wow these babies are huge and delicious!  Had the fish tacos at regular price and these were okay, when we were there they had special prices on craft beers yum."}
{"text":"Slick's Garage is Fantastic! The environment is very relaxed and the \"garage\" decor is fun. I have been here a few times and always have had great food and service. I brought my Mom here for Mother's Day because we are from New Mexico and it is so hard to find that style of cooking anywhere. Just to give an example, Slick's gets there green chilis directly from Hatch, NM.  My Mom was in food heaven and our server (I didnt catch his name) was the nicest guy. He topped off the dining experience. We had to run some errands after lunch and then we were going to come back to get to go orders for other family. They held our left overs for us until we came back so they wouldn't spoil.  Thank you Slick's for giving the \"Costco Ladies\" a wonderful and enjoyable Mother's Day lunch."}
{"text":"We found Slick's on Yelp, looking for a convenient place for friends from three different areas of the valley to meet for a casual dinner.  Walking into the place instantly makes you feel good.  Other than the retired police motorcycle gracing the center of the dining floor, the owners maybe spent $500 on interior decorating.  And it's perfect!!  Checking in with my fellow gourmands, the comments ranged from \"great service\" (Jamie) to \"one of the best burgers ever\" from our pal who rarely orders anything but.  Lee said the \"margaritas are outstanding\" and promptly/ordered another just to make sure.  The shredded beef in the burritos was scrumptious - tender and wonderful flavor, and the New Mexico green chili brought just the right amount of heat.  Excellent service, reasonable prices, outstanding food, fun atmosphere will bring us back!


Brought back more friends for dinner last week... great food, service, fun.  Slick's rocks!!"}
{"text":"Great food, and even better service. Look forward to my next visit. The layout and design is nice. Old stuff, but not cluttered and junky. Well designed."}
{"text":"Third time at slicks.  Food has been great each time. First time- chicken tacos, next two times delicious burgers.  Green chile on everything...yes please!  Good apps and drinks. Great owner and wait staff.  Good place for large groups and kids."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing place. We went there on a Saturday before 6 pm. We had to wait over 20 minutes for a table and they had 3 empty tables, waiting to be bussed; it shouldn't take them that long to get them ready. It looked like the ladies were just standing around talking more than cleaning.The hostess was walking around seemingly unsure of what she should be doing just going back and forth between the tables and the front entrance. 
Once seated,  our waitress had to get someone else to serve our beer, because she was too young. They didn't have the beer on tap that was listed on the table flyer. The waitress suggest something else they had on tap, and offered a sample. It was good, so we ordered that. 
It took 30 minutes to get our burgers and fries and they were good, but nothing special. My son was disappointed in the small amount of guacamole his had. I had to ask twice for a side of mayo for mine. 
The waitress was very friendly. I just do not understand why they were so slow when it wasn't even that busy. 
There are a lot of other places to choose from in this area, so we won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the $5 you-call-its for Whiskey Wednesdays (which I took full advantage of with Jameson). The food is delicious, I've tried the fries, wings, and chile relleno! The manager and staff are extremely friendly and the atmosphere is a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Delicious Mexican food and great service! Going back to try their Sopapia next!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my birthday and I wanted to invite the family out to a place we hadn't been before. We walked in and were seated immediately. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The menu looked good and everyone ordered something different. I personally had the Hot Rod Burger. I took a bite and the burger was dry, unflavorful and otherwise really gross. My son who is 9 had the chicken fingers. He took one bite and said he can't eat them they were disgusting . Daughter 6 had kids nachos. The nachos were literally tortilla chips with a tiny sprinkle of shredded cheese. I won't keep going but you get the hint. Food was less than ok. Do yourself a favor and move on, skip this joint.. or you like my family will be fighting for bathroom rights the next day. 

1 star for the food but because of the staff they deserve 2."}
{"text":"This is a great \"yummy\" place to eat and relax with the very friendly staff!  Had the $2 Tacos, soooooo good!"}
{"text":"Megan, our waitress was awesome!! Best service I've had in a long time!! AJ the bartender made quite a few tasty beverages for us. We came in on whisky Wednesday and had some super classy whisky shots. The French fries are bomb as fuckkkk. Get them. Worth every calorie. Best American grill in P83!"}
{"text":"Huge burgers, lots of choices. Real lamb gyros, shrimp tacos and more. Worth every penny. Go check them out."}
{"text":"For the breakfast burger w cheese fries and hubby got the guacamole burger.  Both were delicious and service was excellent. Would def recommend."}
{"text":"A very cool place with great food. The decor is really fun and the food was very good. Even a basic sandwich tastes yummy with Hatch chilies on it. They are having a big birthday bash for charity next Saturday so check it out."}
{"text":"Had seen the restaurant and read the reviews. 
The restaurant is decorated with old signs mostly about gas stations. I really liked the decorations.
Not sure what he smell was? Maybe the cleaner they use. Not objectionable but just made you wonder? 
We was seated quickly, mostly because it was early. We had on old Tonka toy truck with the salt and pepper in it. Nice!  Want one! 
Ordered a hamburger with no bun and a side of  their green chili. This chili was heated which I did not know. Put it on my hamburger and blistered my mouth. Ouch!! Some one should tell you it is heated. Anyway, I expected the chili peppers to be spicy but they were not. Since this burger was without bun you could see it's make up. The tomato?? Well it was about 1/16 inch thick or less. You could see through it. Only one slice about 1-1/2 inch round. The fries were good. Just how I like. The service was good with the right amount of attention.
The price was I thought high for what you get.
If you charge more than others in the area it needs to be very very good."}
{"text":"Disappointed,  wings were done well,  however the sauce was not great,  over priced beer that was not super cold or crisp and cold fries.  Chips and salsa were good,  and good service."}
