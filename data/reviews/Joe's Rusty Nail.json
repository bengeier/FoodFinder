{"text":"I've been going here since I was a wee tot.  I have always enjoyed their food even though there's nothing too special about it.  I really like their breakfast menu.  You always seem to get lots of food for very little money, which is nice.    My only complaint is that it is WAY TOO SMALL and always very busy.  They should really look at expanding the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The atmosphere is cozy. The staff is super friendly. The prices are good. If you are in the Bellevue area of Pittsburgh it's definitely worth the visit. Lots of little shops are nearby as well so you can take a stroll after you eat the filling meal."}
{"text":"Been here for breakfast a few times.  My new go-to place as I just moved to the area.  As someone else mentioned it's seat yourself and cash only.  Breakfast has always been good with large portions.  My boyfriend and I usually end up splitting something and getting an extra order of cheesy potato puffs (which are amazing).  Eggs Benedict is usually my breakfast out choice but I wasn't crazy over the cheese sauce.  Everything else I've had here has been delicious though.  The staff is always pleasant and quick.  Great little diner!"}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive and the food comes out quick.  I started out with their home made cheeseburger soup. Very tasty.  The home made ranch dressing for the salad was also very good.     For my main course I ordered the penne and fillet.  This was possibly one of the worst dishes I have ever eaten.  The penne was overcooked and the sauce the penne was saut√©ed in along with some spinach was greasy and lacked flavor.  They made an attempt to hide it with parmesan cheese.  The fillet was not... just random chunks of fatty beef with no flavoring.  They were not marinated, not uniformly cut nor trimmed.   Sad when the bread and butter is the best part of your meal."}
{"text":"Not much seating, but definitely one of our favorite places to grab a quick breakfast. Delicious food! Cash only, they do have an ATM inside if needed."}
{"text":"My friend and I just ate dinner at Joe's Rusty Nail for the first time this evening. I ordered the stuffed cabbage and he ordered the meatloaf. Both dinners were fantastic, the service was great, and the atmosphere was very nice. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food at Joe's Rusty nail is GREAT. As the pictures will show, the servings/portions are plentiful. The service is quick, and the staff personable. I went there for breakfast AND everyone in our group left sated!! As always I had my kid carnivores in tow, and as is their custom they laid waste to EVERYTHING edible that was put before them. While they are a TAD (and I do mean tad)  bit pricey I believe that the food is more than worth it. The clientele (what I can only believe are Bellevue regulars) are polite and inviting. My breakfast was made well, tasted great, and dressed pretty as a picture. I will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last. As I say I vote with my feet and my USD, and the staff at rusty nail can sleep well tonight knowing that my hard earned cash, will continue to flow at Joe's and my feet will continue to bring me there hopefully more often than not!!"}
{"text":"On our recent visit to Pittsburgh my family and I had breakfast at the Rusty Nail in Bellevue (dad's hometown).  The place is on the main street, Lincoln Ave (or up street as my family called it).  They were quite busy on a Saturday morning but we only waited about 5-10 minutes for a table.  I enjoyed a sausage omelet with American cheese and my husband had a Denver omelet.  The omelets were well prepared and served with toast.  Potatoes were and extra $2.29, but a serving of potatoes was enough for two.  Breakfast for four adults was about $50 including tip.  All adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfast.  The service was friendly and prompt on the day we were there and coffee refills were offered readily.  It is cramped quarters, but typical for neighborhood non-diner breakfast joints in urban areas.  We had a great diner breakfast in homey surroundings.  We will definitely go back when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem. Awesome service cheap super yummy food you get a TON of food for your buck. Need I go on? I have been for breakfast and dinner. They always have specials to choose from as well. One of the many benifits of living in the suburbs of pgh that you can take advantage of!"}
{"text":"We've stopped in here for breakfast a handful of times. On warmer days you might have to wait but they have a list system they manage outside and offer up free coffee for those waiting.  They offer up big portions and I've rarely finished a meal here. Just so happens they focus on omelettes and pancakes, two things I rarely order for breakfast. The pancakes are big, semi-dense and have a nice flavor. Eggs cooked to order are very large and delicious. The potatoes and onions are good, but require hot sauce for flavor in my opinion.  Major downfall is the coffee, I'm sure it's Folger's or something comparable, not very drinkable unfortunately.  Waitstaff is typically pleasant and the prices are affordable. Worthwhile spot to visit if you want to avoid the chains in the area. Cash only."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Cheap, delicious food and excellent service. Portions are huge, I actually brought some home which never happens. Just moved to the area so I will be back."}
{"text":"Celebrated with friends from fitness class. Service was great considering the large size of our group at this local business. I enjoyed my salad and dinner feature of chicken parmesan. The serving size was generous and I had food for lunch the next day. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Great home style breakfast, sandwiches and dinner. Joe has something great going on here. Waitresses have been there for years as well, and they are very good."}
{"text":"The first time we went here assuming by the name that it must be a dive bar. We were disappointed, but we were also hungry so we ordered dinner. It was just nothing special pretty typical greasy diner food. While there we couldn't help but notice all the articles and awards on the wall stating this was one of Pittsburgh's best breakfast spots. So, sometime later, on a hungover morning after a wedding some of my boyfriends friends were staying with me and wanted to get some breakfast and I thought let's check out that rusty nail again. What a great decision. I think we all got one of the specials and they were all delicious. Mine came with some kind of homemade hash brown patties that were amazing. The only downside is they only take cash (that's not uncommon around here) but they have an atm. Also there is often a wait on the weekends but for us it wasn't very long and they have free coffee outside for you while you wait. Well ok one more thing the actual restaurant is very small and kinda lop-sided but hey I'd rather have a cheap delicious breakfast in a shitty place than pay more for a nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"When first moving into Bellevue, I knew I needed to find a solid breakfast place. The Rusty Nail fit the bill for exactly what I was looking for: Attentive and kind staff Home-like, comfortable diner feel Solid eggs, bacon, and potatoes Cheap  I've also been to Rusty nail for dinner, and it's still cheap prices and huge portions; however, not nearly as tasty as their breakfast. Stick to things you'd normally get at a diner, nothing that sounds too fancy, and you're sure to be satisfied!  Tip! Cash only, but there is an ATM."}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast on a Sunday!!  Home cooked meals. Joe is awesome. Always good service. Inexpensive.   The omelettes are always a good choice. Same with the Country egg meal. Really can't go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, daily specials, comfort food, simple, flavor, and plenty! I should have stopped half way to try a desert.  Cash only is not a problem. Bring your own or use the ATM. Will definitely recommend and come back."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunches serve great pancakes, and I always felt so fancy eating here as a kid.  Note that if you wait until the churches let out to get in line that there will be a long queue outside.  The rest of the menu ranges from decent to average, but the food is always cheap.  The tables are so close together it feels like you're crawling over your neighbors to be seated.  On nicer summer days and during any of the Bellevue events, they often serve fresh lemonade or iced tea outside."}
{"text":"This is a little neighborhood restaurant with home cooked meals. The staff is polite and friendly. The place is small and can be noisy when packed. I'd say probably not good for larger groups.  My food was great, liver and onions topped with bacon. I got two sides, French onion soup and potato pancakes. Everything was bomb. My fiance got meatloaf, which she said was alright and looked more like a Salisbury steak. They also serve you a basket of some fresh bread with butter.   Overall it's a good place to get a home cooked meal for a great price."}
{"text":"This is one of the true sleepers of \"neighborhood Pittsburgh.\" Since 1979, this \"diner/family restaurant\" has been serving excellent breakfasts and home-cooked dinners. The staff has been there as long.  They have some of the best fresh-brewed iced tea in the city. They also have my favorite pancakes. If you're looking for a cheap, low key, dependable place to go, come home at 8 o'clock one evening, sit in the window, and especially around the holiday season, I assure you that it will be one of the best \"old time\" meals you'll ever have.   I hate its name, but I love the Rusty Nail."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze, to begin with.  They really need to pull some tables out of there to make more room.  We were right on top of another table with two very loud young children, and there was just no buffer.  And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.  For dinner though, unless you like super-bland food, I probably wouldn't return for seconds."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast around noon, and there was plenty of open tables considering how small it is. You seat yourself and make sure to bring cash because they only accept cash or checks. However, they have an ATM inside the restaurant (smart way to make extra money.) That's too bad I didn't know this before. The breakfast was delicious, but the food portion was smaller than your average food portion size. Besides that the service and the food was great. I would definitely come back or recommend this place for breakfast if staying in town. We stayed at the Fremont Suite (Five Stars on AirBnb) which was walking distance for us."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast so that's all I can review.  The portion sizes are big and the prices are reasonable. The wait staff is awesome. Great customer service the wait staff actually brings you things you request quickly and with a smile. Cash only, on street meter parking.."}
{"text":"Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I'm sad to say I was sorely disappointed.   They have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that's right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.    We were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.  And it's not that I thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  Given the plethora of choices in Bellevue, this will not be my first stop should I find myself on Lincoln Avenue for breakfast again."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a visit to Pittsburgh.  Food and service was outstanding. Be warned though,  these are not small portions, come hungry. I had the country breakfast,  it took up two full plates.  Every thing was cooked perfectly.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a real home cooked meal."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and reasonable.The waitresses are fantastic and coffee cup is always full."}
{"text":"I always see this place, and Saturday we decided to stop in for lunch. The atmosphere was pleasant. My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which he loved. I however, ordered the steak and cheese pita and was extremely disappointed. The pita was soft and fresh but the steak was terrible. It was very steak-um like and saturated with grease. When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Never have a bad experience here. Potato skins are the best around. Chicken parmigana was a big cutlet fried to perfection. The bread basket is full of delicious soft bread and rolls. The texas burger is one of my favorites also."}
{"text":"The Rusty Nail is a neighborhood diner-style restaurant that serves Pittsburgh-centric comfort foods.  Meatloaf, pasta, and hot roast beef all grace the menu.  I came here with my dad who ordered a hot roast beef, and I ordered a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs.  Both meals were right around $10 and delicious.  The portions were huge, and the waitstaff was very friendly.  I'm guessing it was the owner, but a nice guy came around asking everyone how their food was and making small talk.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the 'Burgh. Never miss an opportunity to dine here are when I am going to Steelers games or visiting family"}
{"text":"Love the Rusty Nail. Have been going there since I was a kid. Always friendly service, great prices, good food. American fare with huge portions. You will leave with a doggie bag."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this neighborhood brunch spot and popped in this weekend. It's cash only and seat yourself so don't just stand there when you walk in like we did. There's no hostess station so pick a table and sit down. Blend! We sat down next to an elderly gentleman reading the newspaper in his Steelers' Starters jacket. That's the type of brunch place this is.  Prices are very reasonable: basic breakfasts (eggs, pancakes, omlettes) weren't over $6.95 and even the specials were only $8 or $9.  I got the eggs benedict which is my go-to, however I didn't care for this version. Instead of hollandaise sauce, the dish comes with CHEESE sauce. Not my favorite that it came on a thin English muffin either, but our potatoes were good. (Two options: deep fried and pan fried with onions. We got both and thought the deep fried were best. Can you blame us?!)  Total bill for 2 came to $20. I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of their other breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Joe's after seeing it for a while.  Was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was.  I had a stuffed chicken breast.  The name escapes me, but it was very good.  My 6 year old was pleased & so was my boyfriend (he's a hard critic too).  We'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"The place to go to if you are hungry for a home cooked meal yet lack the time and energy to prepare it yourself.  Traditional meals feature meatloaf, roast beef and are served with all the trimmings. The dining room is small with plenty of staff on hand. I noticed a good bit of warm conversations taking place among the staff and the regular customers. Probably not the place to go if you prefer having a private conversation during your meal. Cash only but there is an ATM available."}
{"text":"A great Pittsburgh diner with friendly service and good diner food. If there are any problems, the prices a bit high for diner food and, as others have said, it's extremely cramped. Otherwise, it's an enjoyable place to eat and the food is, indeed, very good."}
{"text":"Great little place. Very busy on a Saturday morning but not so much you had to wait. Staff is really great and constantly hustling to get everything done they need to. Belgian waffle with cherrys was out of this world. Perfect little mom and pop place.  Cash only but have an atm on-site."}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time today. I must say that I left satisfied and full. I ordered the steak omelet it was very good. Wait staff very good. Will go back again."}
{"text":"The Rusty Nail stands as a hallmark of Bellevue living. Crowded. Good breakfast. Frequented by hordes of the elderly. This place has got more character than Daniel Day-Lewis in the critically acclaimed 2007 drama There Will Be Blood.   5/5 clams with a nostalgia bias advisory to all viewers -TV"}
{"text":"I ate here this past Sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.  For my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast."}
{"text":"I love a good gem. A gem close to home is even better. Joe's is just that. I had no idea it was there till I moved to Avalon a few years ago. I will now share my gem with you.   Mom drove down one night to have dinner with me. I was feeling healthy (hahah, short lived) so I decided to get a steak salad. But since were here in the good old 412, salads mean croutons, fries and boiled eggs. Sooo, borderline healthy. I tried.   I can't even describe to you how big this salad was. I can almost compare it to the salad they bring a family of four at the Olive Garden. Tons of fresh veggies, a good amount of steak, eggs, and a plentiful topping of fries. I got the ranch dressing and Mom got Italian. They didn't specify that their dressings are made in house, but they seemed it, even if they weren't.   Mom and I could have split one of these! But I'm glad we didn't. It was such a good salad. I love cucumbers, and fortunately, Mom doesn't, so I got to steal hers. Win!   The service was great. The server knew her menu, and made suggestions when Mom was undecided between the salad and the special.   Mental note to self: they are cash or check (what?) only.   Happy Eating."}
{"text":"My go to breakfast spot. Very affordable and high quality. Comfy environment. Lovely staff too! Bring cash"}
{"text":"Typical diner spot with really good food.  Portions are ridiculous!  I wish the dining area was bigger but it adds to the charm of the place.  Breakfast lunch or dinner you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We love to go here for breakfast. It's affordable and delicious. They have great pancakes, italian toast, crispy potatoes and large omelettes.  The wait staff are very friendly every time we've been there as well.  One thing to note is the restaurant atmosphere isn't updated.  It's really like a time warp back to the 80's but it's comfortable and the food speaks for itself.  Also bring cash. No cards accepted. Other than that it's a nice option for a brunch spot!"}
{"text":"I recently checked out Rusty Nail with a friend. The atmosphere was very small but cute with an old school style to it. It's like walking to Mom's kitchen and dining room. The only thing I didn't care for was the cold breeze when someone walks in the door. I asked the waitress what the most popular item is on the menu. And she said her absolute favorite was the Tuna Fish Melt. She said it so passionately that I just had to try it. I ordered that with fries.  The wait was not long, and the sandwich was pretty ok. I just wish that it had just a little bit more flavor to it. But all in all, pretty decent. The service was very pleasant, and so I will return to try out another item. And will post an updated review....for now, check it out...it's a cute little restaurant with food that taste a bit like it's from Mom's kitchen. Oh and make sure you bring cash. That's one of my minor pet peeves when restaurants doing accept credit cards, but there is an ATM in the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a wholesome restaurant with GIANT PORTIONS. I only come here for breakfast & my favorite meal is the French Toast Combo. It comes with an egg & choice of bacon or sausage, but I don't eat meat so I always substitute another egg in place of meat.  Service is usually pretty quick but if you go on a weekend there's a wait outside of the door. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because there isn't much for me to eat on the lunch menu, being a vegetarian. I did order Alfredo once without chicken & it was full of small pieces of uncooked garlic. I couldn't even eat much of it. Other than pasta, there weren't really any meatless options. However, they serve breakfast all day & their coffee is pretty good for being a diner. I will always come back here because the food is always consistent and the service is always good."}
{"text":"Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!"}
{"text":"I am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare, or the energy banks are depleted for cooking. Bellevue does seem to have a small collection of decent eats at reasonable prices, and The Rusty Nail is one of that handful of good examples of neighborhood haunts.  It's touted as a 'diner' in many of the reviews, but it really is a step above your average 'diner', and is more of a cozy neighborhood gathering spot for a decent burger, or entree. I've not made it there for the breakfast, but have always been satisfied by the dinners.  Rusty Nail is hardly on the gourmet end of the scale. In fact, I would imagine the Sysco truck pulls up out back regularly with deliveries of food parts, from cans of sauces to frozen animal chunks. As long as those parts are assembled and doctored to make them seem a bit fresher than the typical conveyor-belt diner, all is fine. And indeed, all IS fine.  So few of our local 'diners' are up to snuff when it comes to serving up decent 'diner' fare, that I can't call Rusty Nail a diner. It's a neighborhood family restaurant. Period.  Burgers, meatloaf, pot roast, fish sammiches, salads, pastas...a varied but adequate menu. Fair and decent prices. Friendly and attentive service. A cozy enough atmosphere (although I have to say AGAIN in a review of a restaurant, if you've got multiple TVs in the space, for gods sake, can ONE of them NOT be showing SPORTS coverage??) and a pleasant crowd of patrons.   During my last visit, there was a large family gathering at the next table. A nicely polished middle-class clan, ranging in age from gramps to granddaughter. At one point, dad received a phone call on his cell...and actually stepped OUTSIDE to have his conversation. As I was leaving I had to pat him on the back and thank him for being one of the few remaining decent guys with manners!  Bottom line...Rusty Nail is comfortable. It's not a drive-out-of-you-way destination for dining. It is what it is. A great little neighborhood spot FOR the neighborhood.   But do bring cash. The don't take credit cards. Believe it or not, they WILL actually take a check."}
{"text":"The food here is always delicious! They do not accept credit or debit cards for payment, thus keeping their prices low! True comfort food!"}
{"text":"The food here is okay and the servers are pretty nice. I enjoy the breakfast here more than anything else. I do think they need a customer bathroom though because it's super uncomfortable going in the back where the servers are to go"}
{"text":"The dining area is really cramped and awkwardly laid out. There's no counter or booths, or any view of the kitchen or prep area. So it's not your typical diner atmosphere, and every once in a while you're elbows will get bumped by a server trying to pass. But it really isn't that much of a deterrent, as the breakfast itself was delicious. I ordered a broccoli and cheese omelet, and for no charge I was able to add an extra egg. Who said nothing in life is free? The broccoli was actually seasoned and fresh, and the Russian rye toast was different then standard rye and tasted like pumpernickel. My wife's poached eggs were done perfectly and the staff was friendly and fast. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a cheap, good breakfast spot in Bellevue."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place's breakfast and lunch. Their dinner items lack a little for my taste but they make up for it with their lunch and breakfast items. Their staff is very friendly and welcoming. I have been here several times since moving to the area three years ago and it almost never disappoints."}
{"text":"I had one of the breakfast specials and it was fantastic. There was also a continuous flow of coffee, which is always nice. Probably just missed the church crowd so it wasn't too busy either. Definitely a good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great homemade food! Wonderful service! I always bring my dad here when I come to Pittsburgh to visit him. We both always enjoy our meal along with our visit."}
{"text":"French onion soup is always on the menu. Try their breakfast omelets. This is a classic American dinner if you are into that kind of setting this is a good one."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner at about 4:30 on Saturday. There were already several diners there. By 5:15 or so, it was packed. The local people seem to love this place. Our food wasn't any better than OK. The onion soup was very good, as was the crab cake in my Mermaid Devonshire. The rest of the Devonshire wasn't very good -- just a lot of Cheez-Wiz or melted Velveeta. My wife's hamburger was nearly inedible -- overcooked and extremely dry. The staff was friendly and helpful, and there were enough of them to handle the good-sized crowd. Nice place, and seemingly very popular, but the food was only fair."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast only - It's been quite some time since I ate at the Rusty Nail, but I recently went there with my boyfriend for breakfast on a Sunday morning, and it is going to be our new go-to place whenever we are craving breakfast out of the house.  They have a reasonably priced menu with the standard breakfast offerings of eggs, omelets, french toast, and pancakes with options of bacon, sausage, hash browns or homefries and a variety of breads from which to choose for toast.  I love how they have free coffee out for people who have to wait for a table, though I was surprised that there wasn't a wait when we showed up and we were seated fairly quickly.    The place is a bit crowded in that the space is smallish with a lot of seated packed in, but overall we didn't feel claustrophobic, but it is hard to make your way through the dining area, so be warned.  Service was a little shaky at first as we seemed to have 3 different employees attend to us, until we finally realized which person was our waitress, but after that everything was smooth sailing.  I ordered an bacon and cheese omelet with a side of rye toast and my boyfriend got 2 eggs over easy with a side of bacon and sausage and hashbrowns well done.  Everything was cooked to our liking and arrived in a timely manner.  Overall, we really enjoyed our experience there and look forward to going back again soon.  Word of warning - they only take cash, and do have an ATM on site, but if you want to avoid a high withdrawal fee, make sure to have cash on hand before you walk in the door."}
{"text":"Checked out the neighborhood restaurant for Sunday brunch. The portions were generous and the omelets were very good. We felt that much of the food (e.g., sides) and service were just average. For example, we typically had to ask for coffee to be refilled. It is a great place to go for a quick bite to eat on a Sunday morning, but I would not make a special trip to the restaurant."}
