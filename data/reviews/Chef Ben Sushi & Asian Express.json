{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for dinner. We couldn't believe how cheap the prices were, well we ordered two rolls, one for each, chicken fried rice for my husband and spicy teriyaki noodles for me. Needless to say YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, the rolls are tasteless, the chicken fried rice should be call peas fried rice, but the worse part of it all was my teriyaki noodles never came. We asked and all we got was \"sorry, it should be coming soon\" 25 minutes after the rice come out we decided to leave. No apologies were given. All we got was \"you don't have to pay for the noodles\" which I thought it was needless to say. I mean they thought they were doing us a favor for not charging us for food we didn't get. Never going back here again. Awful."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE !! the lady that works the front sometimes has always had some.kind of attitude which we've dealt with but after this last time the attitude and the fact SHE WOULDN'T GIVE MORE THAN 4 SOY SAUCES pushed my buttons.  I wanted four more but nope couldn't be done. My 2 yr old was with me do I didn't want to create a huge scene.  The sushi has always been ok. We only come here because it's a convenient location but we will NOT BE returning. Learn son customer service and then maybe we will reconsider.  I am always very polite when asking and ordering and always saying please and thank you and to be treated like this over 4 extra soy sauce 2as ridiculous. I'd give zero stars but it won't let me."}
{"text":"Nice place , I like the menu.  Cucumber rolls are my favourite. Service can be slow though, specially when there are a lot of people.  One time I went there Iand after being done, I discovered that I forgot my wallet.. They were very nice and  although I offered to go home and bring the money, they saiid do nt worry it is on us..I came back the next day and paid. The manager  and the waitresses are very nice."}
{"text":"This is one of my local favorites. I can call in Sushi and spend about the same amount of money as the crappy fast food places. They recently started a rewards program where you get something free every 5th visit. I have had two hot dishes chicken teriyaki (not so good) and beef yakisoba which was slightly better. I prefer the rolls! I frequently order the spicy onion and spicy salmon. Both are quite tasty! Enough so that I didn't dock pints for the sea-saltless edamame. The service is fast and friendly. The rolls are on the smaller side but well worth it for the price and taste! I recently took my friend because I figured she would appreciate some help finding great places being new to this part of town. She loves it and goes at least once a week with her daughters!"}
{"text":"My family has eaten at Chef Ben many times.  The food is consistently good, whether it is from the sushi menu or a teriyaki bowl selection.  The prices are very reasonable, as well. The watresses are also very friendly."}
{"text":"Chef Ben is a great little place to enjoy some awesome sushi and food at a very reasonable price. A good amount of rolls average $3.50 and are very well prepared. This place was so good we went back the next day."}
{"text":"This is place is amazing for their fresh bento boxes. More affordable than other sushi hotspots."}
{"text":"I was here for Happy Hour, but they were closed during posted business hours.  The food may be pretty good here, but I'll never know because their door was locked."}
{"text":"Family friendly spot for sure. Rare to find an Asian spot without the usual sake crowd. Service is quick and friendly. My family has been here 4 times in a months time. They've never disappointed.  We've even called in take out and it was done quick even though I was actually already on my way there...lol! Let's not forget that it is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff with a family feel to the restaurant. The husband and wife team provide excellent food at very economical prices. My personal preference is the chicken teriyaki with no vegetables. It has became a weekly staple for my family. I highly recommend for a quick bite out or for take out."}
{"text":"We've got delivery twice from them before they decided we were too far (boo), and we did like the dishes we got. Wish they would reconsider their delivery area as no other asian restaurant serves where I live and they would make a killing. Some of their stuff can be a bit greasy, which is why I knocked off one star, but they're overall good."}
{"text":"The sushi is descent and cheap. The veggie roll tasting the freshest. Not so good teriyaki to salty."}
{"text":"I ordered the special of the day... Spicy mango roll and it was delicious. I am from the Pacific Northwest so I enjoy my sushi. If you are looking for a quick bite, that is relatively cheap I'd recommend Chef Ben's. The one downfall was the miso soup which should be called miso broth. The flavor was right on just no green onions or tofu. If we were passing through again we'd stop for some sushi. Also, the service was friendly and my order was ready within five minutes."}
{"text":"Fast and fresh. This is a family owned restaurant.  Ben does exist and he is the head chef. They are always willing to listen and make things how you would like them. A good tip is if you think the hot is too hot and the mild is too mild ask them to mix the two during the cooking. The chicken is good. The veggies are always fresh and perfectly cooked. Yum."}
{"text":"Amazing food great prices (happy hour) nice environment friendly atmosphere, definitely enjoy the fresh sushi and beef teriyaki, now serving imported beer"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for several years now. Owners are very friendly and the food is fantastic! One of the best Teriyaki Bowls at the best price you'll find! I LOVE this place and you would too!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was what we ordered - but the food was crap.   It was our first time and we didn't know what to order. They had a $20 special with three dishes and some egg rolls. All were crap. Wouldn't give it to my dog. We had Teriyaki Beef - some crappy beef with Teriyaki poured over it. Sesame Chicken tasted like the Teriyaki (did they use the same sauce?) The chicken fried rice was a tasteless wonder. They use regular plates but plastic forks and foam glasses. Service was fine though.   We didn't order any sushi or rolls - maybe they can do these well. But for Chinese dishes STAY AWAY.   I give them one year and they will be closed."}
{"text":"I have had Chef Ben 4 times now (3 of the times I ate there and 1 time I got carry out) i am by no means a sushi expert but, I have had it numerous times at numerous places before. Chef Ben is such a great place. They are clean, friendly, and quick.  It is not a very big place, but they really treat you well. I have had the bento special, and also the happy hour special. Both of these give you so much food and they are not expensive at all.   I have never had fishy sushi or gotten sick from any of it. It always tastes and smells great.   I highly recommend it! :)"}
{"text":"I go here pretty regularly since this place opened and it's definitely still my favorite lunch food that I get every time I swing into this area of town. I normally stick with just the teriyaki chicken with rice or teriyaki beef lo mein but only because it is so good I have a hard time turning it down to consider the other options although every time I've branched outside of my comfort zone it's been just as tasty. The food is great for the price but the best part is that it's always consistent. Their egg rolls are the best and at .99 for 3 during lunch time you can't beat that price. I will say I wasn't overly impressed with their sushi but I only tried it once a long time ago because I don't come here when I specifically want sushi."}
{"text":"We love going for the lunch specials, the food is decent. The service is very bad, there is hardly any communication. The servers act like they do not want tone there. We ordered the same soup, sushi and rice bowl, but the last two times we got very sick and we have stopped going. Well try again in a month or so."}
{"text":"The price is good and the sushi tasted great my normal sushi place though open had no cook or sushi chef so decided to try this place again I was impressed. Got a bento a which is different sushi and rolls and I bought a 9 dollar roll spent a lil over 20 after eating realized the bento would have filled me plenty lol. I was happy and will come back"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here via grubhub, which was seamless with none of the issues that other reviewers seem to have had. Had 5 assorted sushi rolls with egg drop soup, with tax, tip, and delivery charge total of $50. Delivery was quick, quoted an hour and change but actually took just shy of 40 minutes. Why two stars? The food... Not bad, but bland and small. The soup was the usual one quart container, but the sushi and egg rolls were tiny. Everything lacked flavor, but it was fresh at least. What you get here is pretty much the same as what you get at a grocery store Sushi counter."}
{"text":"Why do so many places around Phoenix do Teriyaki so poorly? I'm always looking for a good Teriyaki place in the west valley and they all seem to just throw a piece of chicken on a flat top and serve a dry, flavorless and WHITE piece of chicken with some sauce poured over the top. Teriyaki should be char broiled over a flame and have some flavor before adding the sauce.  I ordered a Spicy Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl but it came on a plate for some reason. The chicken was flavorless and the sauce wasn't spicy and very mild in flavor. I would never order the Teriyaki Chicken  again from this place.  The California Roll I had with it was decent for the price and I would eat this again. I will try it again but will try something else on the menu and skip the Teriyaki Chicken."}
{"text":"Save your money and time. Overpriced gross food. You'll need about a gallon of water after eating here. Not sure if it's too much soy sauce, salt, MSG, or what... But it is not pleasant. They have the worst miso soup I've ever tasted. Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!  After a seriously horrible day, we came in to grab a quick bite before we hit the road. The servers were so fast and so friendly. The sushi was amazing! When we got our bill, we were so shocked. We got beers and 3 rolls of sushi, and it was only 20 bucks! By far the most affordable sushi place I have ever been to. Best part is, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Spent $40 for 2 meals and some tasteless sushi.  Got sweet n sour chicken and the chicken was dried and shriveled up. Fried rice was pasty obviously over cooked and shush had no flavor. So mad I wasted so much on bad food."}
{"text":"Second visit here. As good as the first time! I had the A Bento Box this time, with miso soup and I added an order of egg rolls (comes as 2 small rolls).  Same server as before. I will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"I have been to Chef Ben's a number of times, and it has been enjoyable. This time however, I was not pleased.   We ordered the sushi bento box since I've had it before and it has always been tasty. This time, it tasted off... the fish tasted old and just was not very good. I shouldn't have to worry if I'm going to get sick from eating my lunch.  The service was also terrible. Had to explain my order 3 different times (I just didn't want soup. Wasn't that complicated). We also had to fill our own drinks due to the waitress not paying attention. That's not that big of deal, but some service would have been nice.  Not sure what happened here today, usually I love Chef Ben's. This time everything felt off and it seems like this once killer restaurant is on it's way downhill."}
{"text":"We have been to Ben's a couple times now and glad we have found a local place to get Teriyaki close by (after moving from Seattle to PHX, it's hard to find here...). We have ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and the spicy Chicken Teriyaki Yakasoba and enjoyed both.  The regular Teriyaki is a little sweeter than we are \"used to\" but not so much so that we wouldn't keep ordering it.  I like that they are willing to customize your order and have been very friendly.  We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is great for cheap and fast Japanese style food. The sushi is not premium level but it's still great for the price. I was pleasantly surprised at the great value this place offered especially with sushi and sake. I think we've found our favorite place for a simple, casual, fast bite for those Tuesday night's when you don't want to cook. It's a great place and you should try it out. It won't break the bank so it's worth trying at least once."}
{"text":"They have great food & definitely excellent service. Tried their mochi mango flavored and it s definitely delish."}
{"text":"This place has a really good lunch special with two rolls and miso soup for less than $10. Good sushi and good prices."}
{"text":"Good sushi and low prices. Food is consistent and always tastes great. And I couldn't forget the service. They never fail to take care of my myself or my family."}
{"text":"My wife and I really like this place and their 20 dollar special. The staff are really nice and friendly too. This place has average food at best... but its cheap enough to come back every now and then because of their  deals during dinner. We really like the sesame chicken. No major complaints... It worth a try if you want cheap sit down place on a tight budget."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice before I give them an honest review because both times have been take out orders so it's less customer service and interactions. Both times I've walked in to order and then wait for my food there. The place is relatively small so I'm assuming it might get crowded during busy hours.  I ordered off the \"happy hour\" (which is all day, and applies for take out orders also) menu and got the sushi. You can either chose a soup or salad. I opted with miso soup both times. The sushi rolls are full sized rolls as you would get if you ordered off the menu. I've gotten the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and Hawaii roll. The both spicy rolls are very typical that you would find from any other restaurant. The Hawaii roll is a little more deluxe and dressed up. The sweet sauce they drizzle over the roll is not a favorite of mine, it kind of messes with the sushi taste I think.   The prices are VERY fair; much cheaper than you would get anywhere else you go -especially for sushi.  I have not tried their cooked plated entree's so I cannot speak for that. But as for the sushi, I would return time after time because its tasty and cheap."}
{"text":"Fresh tasty food, clean and great service! We ordered 3 rolls, bento box, crab ragoons, dumplings and salad. I can't find anything to complain about except the crab ragoons were small compared to what I'm use too. But still tasty."}
{"text":"I stopped at this cute little shop while passing through Phoenix on my way to Tucson. I had a mad craving for sushi -- but I wanted it fast. I didn't have time to stay in Phoenix for long.   I had never heard of nor been to Chef Ben, and when I walked inside I was already a bit timid. No one other than the staff and chef were inside. But it was that halo period between lunch and dinner, so I figured, \"Meh,\" and walked up to place my order.   This is not a fancy formal place. It really is fast sushi -- no, not fast food sushi, just fast. You can place your order at the counter or take a seat in the dining hall.   Because this is speedy sushi, I was surprised by the menu. It was fuller than I expected. I went with the small sushi bowl and one of their specialty rolls.   The bowl came with your usual suspects: Salmon, tuna, yellowtail, shrimp.... I was slightly disappointed -- until I began eating.   Freshness!   They may skimp a little on variety and on the size of the cut, but the fish was very fresh and had the correct oil-to-firmness ratio. The sushi rice also was quite nice -- as though it were a batch the chef had just made.    The specialty roll also was quite nice. Called the dragon roll, it was made with eel, crab, cucumber and avocado. What I appreciated was its lightness. The roll wasn't drenched in some dreadful sauce, but served as rolled.   Perfect.   I was pleased. I imagine I will stop in time to time while driving through Phoenix. It's a good price for quick, fresh sushi."}
{"text":"Affordable cheap sushi and Chinese food. The staff is friendly and always nice. Their bento boxes are a pretty good deal for all the food you get. Sushi is also good and the Chinese food is good and cheap. Good place to grab some cheap sushi and Chinese food to go."}
{"text":"Chef Ben is a new place for us. The dinner special with sesame chicken and orange chicken we excellent. It was very very good and extremely reasonably priced. We are fans and will be back for sure. Give them a try and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Good value for express sushi.  Attentive service, nice decor."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Great hidden gem . Great weekday specials. It will be a place I will return to! They even have mochi for dessert!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a two star rating because of the service.  First time being in the place so I ordered at the counter, when the lady asked me if I wanted it for here or to go I said here.  After placing my order I went over and had a seat waiting for my food.  After about 20 minutes she comes out with everything in a to go bag, when I said I ordered it for here the lady just looked at me with no explanation and turned around and walked away.  I thought humm that was weird.  All I can say about the food is it was ok for what it was but for sure didn't like the egg drop soup.  Couldn't understand the lady at the counter very well at all either.  She didn't speak very good English..maybe that's why she packed my food to go."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place when I want something delicious, and I don't mind waiting for delivery. I've been to this place in person maybe once, but I remember it being such a good experience. That's why I still order from here.  I like that happy hour is all the time, and there's endless things I can get from the menu. I really like getting the salad when they ask if I want soup or salad because the salad has a dressing that is so good. The sushi itself is super good also, always ordering Philadelphia rolls or California rolls. Whatever interests me.  There had been times, however, when my delivery person didn't bring me any utensils, or a straw, but it's okay! I still managed. I love this place."}
{"text":"My boyfriend get takeout from this place whenever we want food that we know won't disappoint. I usually get the happy hour special with miso soup, the big four roll, and the spicy shrimp roll (or 2 egg rolls + 4 crab puffs) and my boyfriend has decided that he's a big fan of the teriyaki chicken bowl. All of these are awesome and well priced! Next time I'm going to eat inside so I can get try some of the fried items - they just don't do well for pick-up or delivery because they quickly get hard and cold - not the restaurants fault.  Overall, it's fast and the people are always friendly. Not to mention that the sushi is good and very inexpensive. Obviously it's not the best in town but I've been there numerous times and I have yet to leave a review because I wanted to make sure it wasn't a flop but trust me, the the food is GOOD and worth the money. They deserve a 5 star review for what the restaurant offers.  You know what you're getting with Chef Ben's. Definitely try it out if you're not trying to break the bank!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed  I have been to Chef Ben a few times and the food has always been okay.  However, on this last visit I was a little disappointed.   On this visit I had the happy hour special, which consisted of egg drop soup, dumplings,  and teriyaki chicken Mind you, nothing tasted bad, its just nothing was really good either.   I was served my soup almost immediately after I was seated, within 2 minutes my entrée was also served.  I think it would have enjoyed my entrée  had I was given  an opportunity to finish my soup.   Maybe it was just an off day, but the food and serves were mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I ordered sushi last night, I got horrendous food poisoning.  I have eaten sushi for 15 years and this is the first time I became violently ill.  I became horribly sick within the hour. The cramps were excruciating. The other food is ok, but the sushi is so sub-standard even in taste, I am amazed they can keep their doors open."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome price. I found this place by accident but quickly realized what a gem it was. The sushi is more than reasonably priced. The service is awesome. I've become a regular, service like this is HARD to find. Youre treated like a valued customer, which is something that is rare in this day and age. If you want awesome sushi, even better service and keep some money in your wallet, I definitely recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  Sorry, but I'm being honest.  I love sushi.  Rolls...sashimi...etc etc and here, it was as if I got sushi out of a vending machine.  It's hard to mess up a spicy tuna roll.  I took one bite and pretty much had to spit it out.    Maybe the \"food\" is good there, but I will NEVER go there for sushi.    The staff is friendly and the place is clean.  However, I wish the place that used to be in this location was still there.   Again, sushi out of a vending machine.  Ick."}
{"text":"For what you pay, its pretty good sushi. I get the Happy Hour with a Jalapeno Roll and then ask for a suggestion for my second roll with miso soup for $9. I go 2-3 times a month and they now recognize me which I love. Always friendly."}
{"text":"This review is for the delivery service only. I called to order 17 items off the menu at 0800pm and they said I must call a different number to order delivery. I called the number they gave me and it was the customer service number for Grub Hub. I ask the Grub hub rep if I could place and order and he said I have to order online. So, I attempt to place my order online with my IPad through grub hub and the Grub Hub website does not allow me to add items to my order. So I call the Ben Chef and explain the situation and they tell me it's to late to order food from them. They must be doing well to turn down orders of 17 meals. I will never support this business."}
{"text":"If it is wasn't for the haboob, the girls that came to visit sickie me would have eaten in the East side.  They stayed on the West side and we decided to go to Chef Ben's because a friend's daughter works there and it is her first job.  Us Aunts wanted to say hello and give her a hard time.  he he he!    It was cute & clean place.  They have a mix of Japanese and Chinese food.  I ordered the double chicken (panko & grilled) with teriyaki!  The teriyaki was sweeter than I like but it was good.  The service staff was good.  The prices are reasonable.  I would come back to visit again!"}
{"text":"Very humble little joint that is between full service and fast service sushi. Good fresh food at very modest prices. Chef Ben has a hit! The kind of place you can eat at a few times a week and not break the bank."}
{"text":"I just had the most amazing lunch for under $10.00.  I go here all the time and it's consistently good.  Today I tried something different and was pleasantly surprised.  I'm from LA and I'm really picky about my sushi - but I love Chef Ben  Your Customer Roz"}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were so pleasantly surprised. Excellent sushi rolls, spicy edamame, egg drop soup, reasonable happy hour prices and fast service. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried has been good but I only like hot dishes and California rolls (but the spicy rolls are yummy). The place is small but service is fast. I like to support the small business so I'll come here for takeout lunch and grab a boba drink next door."}
{"text":"Great place for quick fast cheap sushi, I Love getting the bento box for 10 bucks you get a lot of food. and every 10 box your 11th one is free. Clean friendly staff. They also have a check in system where you can get free food after so many check in. Try spicy crunch roll really good."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the Bento box deals as well as the sushi. The spicy sushi rolls do not disappoint. I used grub hub to deliver and it was at the door within the half hour, much faster than anticipated on the app. I will definately be trying more from here in the future."}
{"text":"Love the sushi, service and great prices! I come here three or more times a month and I am never disappointed. My favorite roll is the cream cheese roll. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"We came in right at about 7:55 for a quick dinner. The waitress visited our table about 7-10 minutes later to take our drink orders and give us the menu.  She refused to allow us to order the Happy Hour, despite it being only 8:02 and that she was the reason we missed the 8:00pm deadline. Most places have a 5-10 minute grace period for Happy Hour.  Ordered the 12.99 Bento Box with panko chcken, wife had the Teriyaki Beef 8.99 Bento Box with lettuce roll instead of sushi  Soup was fine.  Crab puffs were relatively stale, dumplings were from Costco.  My sushi was a full-scale disaster--undersized, WEIRD taste, and they somehow managed to mess up a Crunch roll into something barely edible. My wife's Teriyaki beef was tough and cold to the touch.  I am baffled by the ratings here and convinced that people in my area must just be used to terrible Asian food."}
{"text":"My review is really based on takeout. This is not my favorite restaurant to sit and eat, but the to go is always good. My little family of three can eat for $20 and there be enough for my husband to take to work for lunch the following day. There are great specials and everything we've had has been hot and freshly prepared - or cold and freshly prepared, as far as sushi goes. We are definitely regulars and are thankful this location is just down the street."}
{"text":"Sushi is good and quick. It's certainly not the best of the best bit it's solid.   The best part is they have yummy offerings for the non sushi eaters in my life.  Service is always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"After trying to order on Yelp and being told I'm to far (5 miles) I called and was told to try the website I am not to far. So after placing $64.00 worth of food in a cart I enter my card # and nope to far. I call back and ask why they can't take my card and order. She said the bank won't allow them to take a card over the phone. I actually am a Senior Account Executive and sign up 20+ new customers a month for Merchant Accounts. If this were my business I would not lose $60 orders because of poor service from another company. Email me if you want to double your profit otherwise I'll spend my money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I happened to stop in during happy hour. You can't beat the pricing. One of my rolls was deep fried and it was a tad over done unfortunately. Other than that it was"}
{"text":"Tried this place as it looked similar to Yogis Grill (one of my favorite lunch spots). Got the chicken teriyaki bowl lunch special, again hoping it would be Yogis-esq.  Definitely was NOT. Chicken was rubbery and flavorless. Came with \"vegetables\", which really mean one piece of broccoli.   Could only eat a few bites"}
{"text":"Great sushi and spring rolls!   I ate here 8 nights in a row while I was in town for work. Every night I would order the sushi to go, and eat it back at my hotel room. It tastes great even 2-3 hours after it was made.   I tried over half of the special $9.25 8 piece rolls. All were amazing.   The soy paper sprint rolls are my favorite especially the Avocado roll!   They also usually have a roll on special for the entire week."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Great prices! Clean!! Most of all great customer service!!! We come at least once a month if not more! I highly recommend this place to anyone that loves sushi!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Chef Bens tonight for the first time. Wanted to get some sushi and some appetizers to go and this is close to my house so I gave it a try. When you walk into this place it reminds you of a typical Asian food express restaurant, but the sushi is what sets them apart. They have an extensive sushi menu and you will not be disappointed. I ordered the salmon sashimi, some nigiri, the big four roll, a salmon roll and crab puffs. The lady that took my order was very patient with me and helpful. She pointed out that one of the rolls I ordered and the crab puffs were on a happy hour special that came with a soup or salad. I placed my order and waited maybe 6 minutes before they were calling my name and handing me my food! The lady who handed me my order let me know they even gave me a free order of egg rolls! When I got home my husband and I started eating and we were so excited because everything was delicious! The salmon was fresh and the sushi rice was perfect. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch when you are craving sushi and in a hurry. I love their happy hour special. You get two items (30 different choices to chose from) and one side. I always get the tempura shrimp roll, mini teriyaki chicken and egg drop soup. Big portion for the price of $8.99."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner to go for my sister and I.  Ordered sweet and sour chicken it was over cooked, added fried rice which was mush.  The dumplings and teriyaki chicken we're good.  The California roll made with imitation crab and seriously tasteless.    Decided that the best part of the meal was the Nithing Bundt cakes that i took home for desert..."}
{"text":"I can't say how much I love this small sushi and Asian restaurant. They have the best spider roll in town. They also have a great lunch specials which includes a $3.30 chicken teriyaki with steamed cabbage and broccoli which is really, really good. I would highly recommend this place for a quick lunch or a low key  dinner. I never have to wait they're always fast & friendly. If you call a pick up order in it's ready in 10 minutes"}
{"text":"Price was good for the quantity of food. Flavor was a little bland and the chicken and beef might have been cat, it was hard to tell but tasted good. Make sure to ask for plastic utensils if you need them."}
{"text":"Love the food. Order chicken teriyaki and it was delicious. We just moved her from CA and found it difficult to find good teriyaki until now. We tried California rolls and they were very fresh and tasty. We will definitely be back. Staff very friendly and is super clean."}
{"text":"We had to change our plans since the haboob was heading our way.  A friend's daughter was working near by so decided to give this new place a try.  I am always skeptical when a Chinese joint trying to do Japanese food.  This place is hidden behind Applebee's and next to a donut shop.   They have a good selection of bento boxes. I had the bento #3 that came with California rolls, Teriyaki chicken, and dumplings. They even have $1 off of all bento boxes. Place is charming, staff is very friendly, and prices quite reasonable.  I'll definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Quick service very tasty food! Love coming here. So if you are tired of the burgers pizza and subs, come on over, I am sure you will enjoy it as much as I do every time!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by admitting I'm FAR from a sushi aficionado. In fact, I'll only eat California rolls because I'm scared to try anything else.  A huge craving for teriyaki chicken led us here. We were really impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and especially the restrooms. The customer service was awesome as well.  We had the happy hour special which was only $8 and included 2 items and soup or salad. The miso soup was satisfying, the teriyaki chicken was really delicious and hit the spot. The California rolls, in my opinion, were fresh-tasting and delicious. For under $20 for two we left really happy and definitely plan to return. I'll be excited to try a Bento box on the next visit."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Chef Ben's and decided give it a shot. Gotta say the prices are what brought us (my daughter and I) in. It seemed fairly priced, clean looking, yet it was not quite welcoming. We ordered the chicken teriyaki,  teriyaki two, and what is usually my favorite, the eel roll. I was completely unsatisfied, the chicken was dry, the beef seemed to be low quality and a bit dry as well. I was most let down by the roll though. I asked the gentleman taking my order \"is the eel fresh water or not?\" His response, \"yes.\" I definitely do not believe it to have been fresh water at all. I have had eel numerous times and at plenty places yet have never had such a salty and fishy tasting roll. The taste was overwhelming and I could not force myself to suck down a second bite."}
{"text":"Chef Bens has the worst customer service ever. I tried to place an order for delivery and they told me to use grubhub which I had already tried and grubhub said they were closed. So they transferred me to grub hub where I sat on hold for 17 minutes. Then got hung up on. Grub hub called me back and said they had problems with their website and to download the app. Chef Bens would not grab a pen and paper and take down my order and just assist a regular customer that orders from my work place all the time. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone nor will I ever order from them again."}
{"text":"Great sushi spot far out in the West Valley.  There are so many options on the menu. Many bento options  and lots of specials including chefs selections. I can say the sushi is fantastic and beautifully presented.  The place is small and very quaint feels like family. We will visit often."}
{"text":"I got the Special Bento box it was very delicious. The staff was very friendly. I was served right away didn't have to wait very long for food to come out. Very peaceful inside as well. Would recommend going again!"}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Stopped in for Happy Hour with my wife.  Great prices and the service was excellent.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"What ever happened to my initial review of this place?  That was so not cool YELP!"}
{"text":"this place has rescued me from so many hung over work days with their amazing Bento combo (pick anyone, they're all amazing!)."}
{"text":"Pretty average/mediocre strip mall sushi joint. Prices are decent but the Sushi seemed a bit not as fresh as other places and they aren't as generous with the actual fish on their sushi dishes.   I paid about 12 for my lunch order but would gladly pay 20 at Tomo Sushi just a few blocks away on Litchfield and McDowell."}
{"text":"By far the most affordable sushi place on the west side :) I love their Hawaii Roll!! The slivers of almond get me every time!! I also love their bento special. If you're not particularly hungry, don't get it! It's a lot of food.  You can get a lot of food for under $10.  Definitely a place to try :) ahem ahem walk over to the donut shop next door and have a boba for dessert. Just sayin!!"}
{"text":"Be careful what you wish for.  I ordered the cucumber roll on the happy hour menu, expecting it would be like all the other cucumber rolls from other sushi restaurants with fish inside,  but instead got a roll with just cucumber. That's all. Lol I Asked the restaurant if I could exchange it, and they said no because the owner said I already ordered it, which is not the way they should have handled it. Although I was disappointed the food was good, and fresh. It was clean and quiet. No waiting at all, but my rolls were small, not sure if that's only on the happy hour menu."}
