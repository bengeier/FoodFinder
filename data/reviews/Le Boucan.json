{"text":"The 5th time I went on Saturday. Service and plating is inconsistent.  A 40 seat casual BBQ should not run on reservations as it effects capacity management put stress on staff and clients.  Some managers better than others, but the one on Saturday should consider working outside the hospitality field.  Unnecessarily awful service experience last.  Lost client."}
{"text":"Délicieux et présentation originale! Petit resto sympathique avec une terrasse en arrière. J'ai bien aimé!"}
{"text":"Le Boucan is a great addition to the up and coming neighborhood, we all know when you're shopping for antiques, one might get hit with a barbeque craving and Le Boucan is there to calm the storm. As they've only been open a few months, there are a few things I'm sure they are ironing out and really not worth mentioning here. So if you're looking for a barbeque fix and there's white stuff falling from the sky, follow the smoke trail here."}
{"text":"Énorme déception Nous avions essayé l'été dernier, et pas convaincu, nous y sommes retournés. Pas en terrasse cette fois. Si la terrasse nous avait permis de faire oublier le très médiocre repas, cette fois nous étions coincés à 4 près de la cuisine pour \"admirer\" le travail tout à fait blasés des personnels et découvrir finalement pourquoi rien ne peut être vraiment bon. Trop de plats pré-cuits, les salades de choux \"chiffonnées\", les frites \"fatiguées et avachies\"... bref rien d'appétissant. Pour le confort, les banquettes étaient peu confortables et sans recul pour être à l'aise à table.  Le personnel en salle pas du tout attentif, visiblement connaissant la déception de sa clientèle et ne cherchant même pas à proposer un dessert préférant éviter un refus poli. Au moment de payer, pas d'inquiétude de savoir si le client est satisfait. Je ne recommande pas du tout cette adresse et les côtés levées sont simplement à classer dans les pires de Montreal"}
{"text":"L'étoile de David  Depuis que la téléréalité s'est mélangée à l'univers culinaire, nous avons eu droit à une panoplie d'émissions à succès, dont Hell's Kitchen, Restaurant Impossible et Top Chef. Avec ces émissions, certains ont connus la gloire (Chuck Hughes avec Iron Chef), d'autres, un échec lamentable (Amy's Baking Company vs Gordon Ramsay). Personnellement, ma préférée demeure Le Restaurateur, avec David Adjey, et c'est notamment grâce à un épisode de la série que le restaurant montréalais Le Boucan s'est fait connaître.  Bouffe  Situé dans le populaire Griffintown, Le Boucan propose une cuisine inspirée des BBQ et techniques de fumages américains. Avec Mademoiselle et Bro, nous avons débuté le festin avec une entrée de Nachos au poulet (15$). À l'exception du fromage assez cheap, le reste était bien, en particulier le poulet fumé. +1 pour la succulente salsa.  On a poursuivi avec un Mac n Cheese (8$); généreuse portion, fromage abondant, mais globalement, j'ai eu mieux ailleurs. Protip: Ajoutez un peu de Tabasco dans votre Mac n Cheese, délicieux !  Comme plats principaux, nous avons préféré se partager le 5 napkins Burger ainsi que leur fameux Pit Boss. Servi avec deux accompagnements au choix (mais au fromage et une délicieuse salade de patates dans notre cas), le Burger (16$) est composé de laitue, cornichon, tomate, fromage cheddar et d'une excellente sauce BBQ. Celle-ci se marie à merveille avec la viande bien épaisse dans ce burger, juste assez gros et pas si salissant finalement.  Nous avions beaucoup d'attentes pour l'assiette du Pit Boss (45$), en particulier pour les côtes-levées qui sont une spécialité du Boucan. Sur le plateau, on retrouve un demi poulet BBQ, du porc effiloché, les côtes-levées (demi dose), une salade de patates, salade de choux et des délicieuses frites cajun. Les côtes-levées se sont malheureusement avérées être une grande déception et loin du résultat qu'on avait vu dans l'épisode (regardez-le, ça vaut la peine!), où le chef passe près de trois semaines, avec David Adjey, à parfaire ses côtes-levées. J'ai de la difficulté à croire que c'est ces côtes-levées coriaces qui attirent la clientèle, soir après soir, et c'est pour cela que je leur donne le bénéfice du doute et espère être simplement tombé sur une mauvaise \"batch\".  Déception similaire avec le poulet un peu sec et son assaisonnement salé. Servi avec leur savoureuse sauce BBQ et cuit à la perfection, le porc effiloché a sauvé la mise. Facilement un des meilleurs pulled pork j'ai mangés à ce jour.  Service/Ambiance  Le service s'est très bien déroulé du début à la fin, même si le resto et sa terrasse étaient pleins. La serveuse nous a même proposé de diviser le burger en cuisine pour nous.  Situé dans un quartier jeune et en effervescence, on retrouve logiquement une bonne ambiance au Boucan. L'endroit est idéal tant pour les groupes que pour les couples qui désirent simplement aller déguster un morceau au bar. Bref, malgré la déception causée par les côtes-levées ce soir-là, j'y retournerai pour un autre essai.  Cool  - Contrairement à beaucoup de restos qui négligent les à-côtés, Le Boucan offre d'excellents accompagnements avec les repas. - OpenTable - Idéal pour les petits/moyens groupes - Terrasse  Bof   - Côtes-levées - Prix de certains plats un peu élevés"}
{"text":"This place was serendipity.   We actually were trying to go to JUNIORs Philippine restaurant a couple of doors down but they were closed.  Started walking towards a Yelp recommended place around the corner and passed this place. Why not we thought.  Lo and behold BEST ribs I have had in Montreal. I kid you not. Chicken was very good too.  Nice selection of beers; great ambiance; friendly staff. What is there not to like!"}
{"text":"Solide.  Le Pit Boss est un plat massif, et absolument tout est délicieux. Pour bien finir le repas je n'ai que 3 mots à dire: brownies au bacon."}
{"text":"horrible service, tight ambience, and the waiters were pressuring us to hurry. not going back"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend on a Saturday night at 9:00 and there was space for us - I've tried at normal eating time (7-8:30) with no luck. It is literally a glorified walk-in closet..TINY..someone mentioned 40 seats, I think that's probably at max max max capacity. You don't come here for the atmosphere though, you come here for the food..and to that regard, it is a GIANT success.   In the MAINS: we tried between us the half-stack pork ribs and the chicken sandwich with white BBQ sauce; STARTERS: chicken wings with mustard BBQ sauce; SIDES: green salad, fries and cheesy corn; DESERT: bacon brownie and sticky toffee pudding.  The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious but the most succulent item was by far the pork ribs. They were fall-off-the-bone delicious barbecue comfortness - I'm not a big fan of ribs, they were my boyfriend's choice, but I wish I had taken them...  The same goes for the chicken wings with mustard BBQ sauce. The wings fell off the bone and were smoked with a sweet and sour rub - they were hands down some of the best wings I've ever had...and the sauce well, let's just say we hid the sauce behind the napkin dispenser so that we can keep it for our main meals it was SO good.  The salad side is really good as far as salad goes..we actually both enjoyed the salad more than our other sides; the fries were just MEH and the cheesy corn wasn't the greatest culinary choice I've ever made.  The bacon brownie desert was nothing short of disgusting as there are actually pieces of bacon in it..not in a good way though, just take my word for it. However, if you were so lucky that god made the desert of the day sticky toffee pudding - you would be an absolute fool not to take it...an absolute fool. Definitely on a list of the best deserts I've ever had. hint: it's not actually pudding...its more like toffee sponge cake with caramel and pralines on top...it's just ridiculous..my mouth is watering thinking about it...don't pass on it!  not a great alcohol selection and they were out of alot of menu items when we got there but their kitchen closes at 11:00 so it's understandable..  All in all, if you've got a craving for late night comfort food; this is the place. Everything on the menu has a smokey taste - and I mean everything - so if that's not your gig then bring your business elsewhere.. I would advise against going too often though, especially if it is your gig, as \"smoked\" foods contain carcinogens and are not safe for frequent consumption...but once in a while, it'll do the soul a great deal of good ;)"}
{"text":"Pulled pork poutine. Does anything else need to be said?   Okay, I get it, some details might help. I realize there are punk, wannabe poutines out there, that don't use curds, but believe me, le boucan has the right stuff, as much meat as fries, and as many squeaky curds as gravy. It's massive and will stop you in your tracks with deliciousness.  We also attacked the ribs, burger, slaw, fries and a bacon brownie, all which are top bbq house choices in my opinion. The burger comes with two cheese blanketed patties, it is not a girly burger by any means. But it was delectable, particularly with the extra mayo on it. Love the bourbon selection here too.   Make reservations, it's a teeny place (which as I have mentioned before means they must be masters of their food domain) and you won't want to stand waiting for a table watching the lucky ones devour saucy ribs. It just wouldn't be fair."}
{"text":"This review is strictly on the food, because I ordered take-out.  Ordered the pit boss platter, which is comprised of a half a rack of ribs, half a chicken, pulled pork, fries, tater salad and coleslaw for about 42 dollars.  It is a lot of food for the price.    The ribs were extremely good.  Best BBQ i have found north of the border in Montreal.  Very juicy and tender, falls right off the bone.  Next time I will just order a full rack for myself.   The chicken was also very good.  Moist and not dry at all.  The skin had a nice flavor to it as well.  The pulled pork was also very good, and when you add the bbq sauce to it, it elevates the flavor.  Standard fries and coleslaw, but the potato salad was tasty.  In summary, best choice if you want any semblance of what southern BBQ tastes like in Montreal."}
{"text":"I went with my dad and I had the mac n cheese. It's a side but I was SOOOO full after eating it! Mac n cheese is my favorite food so I had high expectations, and honestly it was so perfect. My dad has the pulled pork poutine, and it was so huge! It's very saucy and greasy but it was very good as well, though a bit salty but that's just my taste! Everyone should go there!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out for my bday dinner with ywo of my gfriends. We ordered a lot of appetizers since the portions were very generous. The Mac N Cheese was creamy and flavourful as i imagined and the Pulled Pork Poutine was amazing and im one of those weirdos  who doesn't eat poutine. And yes the bacon brownie is awesome! Would def come here again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing; it was definitely the best barbeque I've had, at least when it comes to places outside of the U.S. I would give Le Boucan 4.5 stars as -- previously mentioned -- the food was superb, as was the service. My only complaint was that our table didn't have any of the condiments, napkins, etc. that all others, even unoccupied ones, had; once we asked for the items, however, they were quickly brought over. I'd definitely return to this establishment if I find myself in Montreal again!"}
{"text":"Delicious pulled pork and large portions.  I have been several times and nobody in my party has ever been disappointed in their food.  You get a selection of sides with the various entrees and they have some interesting and delicious desert options like the bacon brownie!  Make reservations because they are often booked up, and if you are there in the summer, make sure to check out the patio!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one. First, make reservations. This place is too small to be stuck at the bar with your friends. You don't want to end up like Karine L who had to hear an earful of restaurant antics from employees, because it's true- you will probably hate the place if you sit at the bar- so avoid at all costs, unless you come as a single- then you'll have a good time fraternizing with the staff, if that's ur thing. Okay, well the table they chose for us was brilliant. I couldn't have hand picked a better table, myself. I made special instructions with the resto, because it was a birthday occasion- and even that was carried-out well. Long story short: I gave them some sparklers to put in the dessert- and the waitress waited too long to come out with them, so they burned out mi-chemin. The b-day boy didn't see the action behind his back, but it was pretty funny. Fortunately, they had other larger sparklers, which they put in the buttermilk pie-which was very tasty. So, on to the food... the ribs were excellent and easily beat any of the corporate rib chains in MTL, so if you live around Le Boucan and you still go to Baton Rouge, Madisons, etc for ribs; shame on you. I ordered the combo, so a note about the chicken: weak. It's not dry, but a smoked 1/4 chicken with no dry rub and just a little sauce on the surface is BO-ring. So, the chicken was average 2.5/5. The pulled pork, I didn't try, yet, but I assume it will be on the same level, if they did the same research as for the ribs: a solid 4/5 rating. Fries, coleslaw and salad were great. Creamed corn and potato salad is okay, but not too original. I recommend the cajun shrimp appetizer(9$) to share, but here's the thing there's only 3 shrimps. They should raise the price to 11$, put 4 shrimps and call it a day. As for the burger, it is big(double patty), juicy and flavorful. Not to mention, a surprising find at a BBQ Smokehouse. Between here and Griffintown, locals have some nice variety to choose from when it comes to premium burgers. The decor is nice and fitting, but the washroms... not so much- they need to work on modifying the sliding door or just get a serious door- to avoid patrons near the bar from hearing people eleviating themselves. With the bathroom practically in the dining room- this needs to be taken more seriously. There are many high marks and average marks to give; hence, the 3/5. It seems, they are still trying to develop their methods with time and some improvements they could easily become the best lil' BBQ Pit resto in Montreal, but not without a beef brisket. Which is why I don't take them seriously as a smokehouse, yet. You need to have the holy trinity down pat: pork(ribs, pulld), chicken, beef (ribs and/or brisket). FYI burgers don't count. They also need to understand and master their dryrubs better. Tons of potential here! I look forward to trying the bacon brownie, next time."}
{"text":"Très bon petit restaurant. J'ai bien aimé l'ambiance. La nourriture était délicieuse!"}
{"text":"Des allures de dinner rustique: banquette rouge de vieux dinner, banquettes de cuir ou fleuries défraîchies, tabourets et chaises en bois s'assembler pour assoir environ 25 clients à l'intérieur sans compter la terrasse arrière isolée et bien intéressante.   Une carte des cocktails maison très intéressante qui est complétée par des bières en fût et en bouteilles, des vins et des whiskys. Les cocktails sont 10-12$, mais très forts en alcool. Je vous suggère le Bourbon smash ou celui à base de limonade, pimm's et concombres.   Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, l'endroit offre un plateau à 45$ qui comprend un demi poulet, un demi rac de côtes levées, du pulled pork, de la salade de patates, de la salade de chou traditionnelle et des frites. La viande est cuite dans leur propre fumoir, elle est gouteuse et bien juteuse sous sa croûte de cendres noires. Les frites sont délicieuses.  À goûter absolument: la poutine au porc effiloché. La sauce est démente, les frites parfaites et on ne manque pas de fromage fondu ou de porc! Moi qui ne suit pas fan de poutine habituellement, je l'aurais gardée pour moi toute seule!  Les ailes de poulet sont aussi très bonnes et accompagnées de choix de sauce dans laquelle on les trempe avant d'en prendre une bouchée. On s'en met plein les doigts et le visage, mais heureusement, des lingettes humides et un distributeur de serviettes sont disponibles sur la table.   Pour ce qui est des desserts: un brownie au bacon peu impressionnant et une tarte au babeurre qui rappelle la tarte au sucre.   Service un peu lent, mais très amical et accueillant.   Attention: des t.v. sont installées sur place pour les matchs de hockey."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork poutine recommend you take the hamburger instead very tasty. Owner kind of gave us attitude cause we had no reservation but otherwise good"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. I am new to the neighbourhood and have a 3 month old baby. The waitress was super friendly and accommodating and reserved us a booth seat meant for 4 people even though we were only a table of two and a baby.  The food was as great as the service. The pulled pork poutine was my favorite and I don't even like pulled pork. The Mac and cheese was also amazing!!!!   Next time I go, I'm definitely trying the burger!!!"}
{"text":"The Yellowjacket cocktail what with its strong yellow chartreuse kick was excellent.  Wings have this granular dry rub that is sweet and savoury, the wings are flawless... 5 napkin burger patty was over seasoned, had too many fillers... maybe breadcrumbs or whatever but the patty was very dry, crumbly and just usual."}
{"text":"The service was impeccable! Very friendly and  helpful tips on what  to  try for the first  time.  Huge plates with affordable prices. The ribs , burger and mac n cheese are DA BOMB  Negative points include a watery tasting sangria , bland potato salad  and not asking the cute waiter s phone number at the end of the  night :)"}

{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, good selection of beer. The place is a little small but it add to the charm. This is also to your advantage because it positively impacts service and the speed at which food is prepared."}
{"text":"As a counterpoint to my vegan adventure the other day, I met up with some friends from out of town here to devour on some southern style cuisine comprising mostly of meat.   Ordered two pit boss platters and some pulled pork poutine and the Cajun shrimps as an appetizer.  The Cajun shrimps while good, didn't really strike me in a \"try this again\" kinda way. Maybe this place needs to serve up some crawfish instead.   The pulled pork poutine was as tasty as it was unhealthy. Soft pork with the now gooey yet still crunchy fries. Love it.   The platter was excellent with the ribs being the highlight. Tender but not so soft that you don't need to work a bit at the bone, I could have eaten another rack! Their 'cue sauce was fantastic, not too sweet and went great with our meat. The chicken was good too but I found the breast meat a little too dry for my liking.   To top it off, I had the bacon brownie. Ridiculous!  As in, \"How did I not have this before!?\"  Come here with a group or your favourite eating buddy."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 20 times, and have experienced only ONE not-so-great meal (it was overcooked and the portion super small).  the place obviously caters to meat eaters, but if you're looking for a 'lighter option', try the blackened salmon.  it is delicious.  every time.  make a reservation, as the place fills up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"J'étais déjà un fan de la succursale sur Notre-Dame et le gage de qualité c'est rendu jusque dans le Vieux-Rosemont! #bbq4ever"}
{"text":"Nous sommes allées, une amie et moi, manger vers 13h, un jour de semaine. Rien d'extraordinaire au niveau des repas malheureusement. Manque de saveurs flagrant. Et nous n'avons eu droit qu'au sourire de notre serveuse une fois la facture entre nos mains. Très condescendante et sur la défensive lorsqu'on lui pose des questions sur le menu."}
{"text":"Comme j'aime cet endroit! Si vous cherchez un resto pour une soirée réussie, optez pour le Boucan, situé dans la petite Bourgogne, pas trop loin du centre-ville.  J'ai adoré l'ambiance chaleureuse de la place au décor simple, mais hyper joli! Et que dire de la terrasse : wow! Elle ne compte que quelques places seulement, mais elle est vraiment belle et c'est assez agréable de s'y trouver en soirée. Le Boucan offre un menu de type smokehouse, aux plats inspirés de la cuisine du sud des États-Unis. Côtes levées, burgers, porc effiloché, mac n' cheese, guédille, vous vous régalerez! Si vous avez une faim de loup ou que vous que vous voulez goûter à tout en partageant avec des amis, essayez le fameux Pit Boss, qui comprend un peu de tout ce qui se trouve sur le menu. Puisque je ne suis pas quelqu'un qui mange beaucoup, je prends bien souvent la salade au poulet qui n'a rien d'ordinaire : elle est absolument DÉLICIEUSE! Le poulet effiloché a un goût légèrement fumé et tiédit la salade, ce que j'adore. J'ai également goûté au mac n' cheese, que je n'ai pas vraiment aimé. Il était excessivement salé et lourd...Pour accompagner votre repas, choisissez une bonne bière ou un cocktail dans la longue liste. Le prix des \" drinks \" est un peu élevé, mais ces derniers sont très bons, alors! Amateur de whisky? Eh bien, vous serez gâté puisque le Boucan semble en avoir une excellente variété.Finalement, choisissez un dessert pour vous sucrer le bec! Mon classique est la tarte au babeurre qui est absolument exquise. Si vous aimez le chocolat et le bacon, optez pour le brownie au bacon, tout le monde dit qu'il délicieux. Pour un choix plus original, goûtez à la tarte à boire!   Côté service, c'est génial! Tout le personnel est gentil et attentionné. Il n'hésitera pas à vous faire des suggestions si vous n'arrivez pas à choisir.   N'oubliez pas de réserver, car le restaurant est toujours plein à craquer!"}

Luckily for us, Fanny was able to give us 2 seats at the bar and nicely told us she had a rez 75 mins later for those 2 spots! We promised to be gone!   Let's just say that normally, we probably would've left because I HATE sitting at the counter but we were looking forward to this little spot with great reviews and so glad we stayed!!!  Awesome ribs....amazingly specialized signature spiced wings and yummy cheesy corn!!!! This became a \"go to\" Montréal spot instantly!!! A family run resto with very very hard working family members!!! Great service, awesome eats and quaint enough to be fun yet very special!! We'll be back!!!!  Merci à toute l'équippe!!!!"}
{"text":"Best pork poutin ever had in Montreal!  The appetizer of colorful taco plus chicken and cheese is joyful. Pork rib with green salad is also pretty good!"}
{"text":"Recently sent an out of town friend to pay a visit to Le Boucan to try their pork ribs.  Ordered a full rack, carry out.  I have to say I enjoyed the sauce which seemed like a nice mix of bar-b-q and mesquite.  Meaty, good cut of rib, not dripping with excess fat, not an old and tough piece.  The sides (coleslaw and fries) however seemed a bit skimpy for the size of the entree.  Beware of man-waiter/server.  Asked my visitor-friend for $36 but handed him a receipt for $32.19 ($28 plus tax) which he only noticed later.  Either ripping off the business (and should be fired) or ripping off tourists (English speakers -- I really hope this isn't the case).  Ribs 5 stars, sides 2 stars, dishonest worker makes my review 1 star."}
{"text":"J'ai bien aimé ma visite au Boucan.  Le sandwich pull pork était bon, ainsi que les accompagnements.  Mention spécial au maïs au fromage qui était tout simplement délicieux.  J'ai gouté au macaroni au fromage qui était correct, disons que je m'attendais à plus!  Il manquait un peu de saveur et de punch.  Le service était tout à fait sympathique!"}
{"text":"Lovely spot. Comfort food and super delicious. Amazing service. Makes my belly happy! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were excited to eat at this Boucan on Father's day. I love Le Boucan in Griffintown. I was most excited eagerly for pulled vege sandwich.  When we arrived, I see one person working and she in front of the cash for 5 minutes therefore not noticing that we are waiting to be seated. We were too polite to raise our voice after her. When finally she saw us, we told her we are 7. I think she was panicking, and she was looking frantically where to seat us when we see the restaurant is practically empty. It's a super hot day; we get a nice corner of the restaurant but it was hot, and the end of our stay we were sweating. I don't understand why didn't they open the AC. Service was really long. Maybe after 10 minutes we got our water. The busboy was very clumsy; he spilled water on my dad, and later we see he spilled water again on another customer. I won't tell details of our food orders, but it was taken after 30 minutes we were seated.   We didn't bother to order appetizer since the service is taking forever. Post orders, my principal dish was missing a part of my side dish. My sister and my mom's side dishes were exchanged. When we notified their mistake no sorry from their mouths. Half of our sandwich were burned. The food tasted below average. Then a new waitress entered to work her shift; she was abrasive and rough. When clearing the table; she hit my mom and dropped napkins all over the floors, and didn't pick up at all. When walked out, the napkins were still on the floor. Again no sorry from their mouths.   In nutshell, I was immensely disappointed with the most horrible service. I will stick to our Griffintown's Le Boucan where I gave 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great little BBQ joint on Notre Dame.  It's not very big, so reservations are a good idea.  Ribs are fall off the bone tender with nice flavourful sauce.  Chicken and pulled pork are good too.  The menu is kind of short but you can't go wrong with any of it, really.  If you're going to a Habs game, show 'em your ticket for a free beer!  The bacon brownie... sounds a little gross, but is yummy.  Although it's an excellent brownie just on its own, personally could live without the bacon..."}
{"text":"I've been here enough times now and it's awesome.  The seating in the back is the best as the restaurant is a little small inside.  The blt with extra bacon is so smokey but worth every bite.  Pulled pork is good to and of course the ribs."}
{"text":"Wahou! Super petit bistro/resto de quartier, avec des spécialités à la viande à tomber par terre :) Je vous conseille la poutine (format entrée est parfois suffisant..) ou les ribs... Ce n'est pas très grand, idéalement faut réserver.. Excellent service, bonne ambiance! A essayer!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pulled pork Poutine and loved it! I also ate some wings which were great as well.  They have a great selection of drinks. I ordered my regular vodka cran but my friend tried a few of their whiskies. Our waiter was super friendly and knew a lot about whiskey and was able to make recommendations to my friend.  The atmosphere was cool, there was a small terasse out back (we called to reserve an outside table) and all the staff was amazing. I can't wait to go back and try their Mac and cheese :)     Update: I tried the Mac and cheese and it was good but there were too many onions for my liking."}
{"text":"I checked out Le Boucan last year and let's just say I've become slightly addicted to their pulled pork poutine. I get a craving for it at least once a week; but I got to fight it off or else I'd go broke. My boyfriend had ordered the ribs and they are literally FALL OFF THE BONE! Their BBQ sauce is amazing!I had the 5 napkin burger which should really be called the 20 napkin burger. It was delicious! The place itself is nice and intimate. The decor is cozy and barn like. The staff is super friendly and makes you feel like you're part of \"Le Boucan family\". When you sit at the bar you'll get to talk to the bartender and waiter like they're your friends; really cool people. The only thing I don't understand is the music they play...like rap and hip hop. It don't find it meshes well and completes the ambiance of the place."}
{"text":"Un seul mot.... Poutine!  Cette merveilleuse poutine au porc est tout simplement un délice!  J'ai adoré mon hamburger et le corn!  J'y retournerais sans hésiter"}
{"text":"Went with some friends and really enjoyed the food. I tried the Alabama chicken sandwich and the pecan pie which I recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered from here today, our foodstuffs were:  Smokey tomato soup. Cajun shrimp. Habanero burger. Sides: cheesy corn, potato salad, Coleslaw, chef salad.  Verdict:  The tomato soup was rather meh, some of the pork in it was nothing but chewy fat, it also needed salt, and the bread served with it was burned. The Cajun shrimp were very tasty, great spicing and cooked perfectly, but 4 for $12...I mean...yikes. The habanero burger was tasty enough, I liked the flavours, the bun was extremely dry though which took away from the overall experience, also the cilantro stems...no thanks. It was advertised to be 150k on the scoville scale, I'd personally be surprised if it would hit 5k. Last but not least the sides, I'm just going to rate them 1 to 10: Cheesy corn 8 Potato salad 7 Coleslaw 5 Chef salad...well it never got delivered, so -1?  TLDR: Pretty d@mn expensive, food-wise a hit and miss."}
{"text":"I did not get the chance to eat at this establishment because I was not afforded the opportunity. It was a later Saturday evening when I came in. I came by myself and half the restaurant was empty. There were perhaps two tables full and there were at least 5-6 seats open at the bar. I asked the lady next to me if the seat next to her was taken and she responded no. I took a seat and a gentleman asked me something in French.  I said \"I'm sorry, I don't speak French but I would like a menu for dinner, please\". He said \"oh, okay, hold on a minute\". After a few moments, he returned and said \"Because you don't have a reservation, we can't serve you until at least 9:30 pm.\" The time was currently 8:20. Obviously there was one of two things going on here: a.) this restaurant is extremely mismanaged and will turn away paying customers when literally half their restaurant is empty or b.) they don't want to serve tourists/English speaking customers.   Either way, they are fools and if they keep it up, they'll soon be out of business. Good luck, or as you say in French...bonne chance!"}
{"text":"I can eat a pulled-pork poutine any day and still not be full. Going to Le Boucan makes you feel like you are visiting one of the restaurants in an episode of Guy Fieri's Diners, Dive-Ins and Dives. I came across this place by accident when all the other restaurants on Notre Dame street were closed once the breakfast hour finished. It's not hard to find this place, you just need to follow your nose. I was lucky to take in the Southern atmosphere and western decorum, as I was enjoying my meal in their terrace in the back. The best part about the terrace is that you can enjoy your meal without all the background noise from the busy streets. Truly an authentic experience worth enjoying again. Did I mention they have bacon brownies? Enough said, try the place out for yourself. Just make sure you bring a hefty wallet."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, food is always good, fresh and somewhat consistent. The service is polite and friendly.   They have a great selection of drinks, southern style food & drinks actually. I had a drink called the southern wheeler i think, the tipsyness made me forget its name. you couldn't taste much of the alcohol in it but it had quite a kick ! The Mac & cheese entree ( 8$ ) was great, I should have stopped there but I was greedy and wanted more so I got a half rack of ribs that I couldn't finish but they were good, a bit dryer than last time i tried them. The fries were good but I think they forgot the dressing on the coleslaw this time. Ill be ordering the wings again for sure, I think they were smoked, really good flavor and crispiness to them, comes with dipping sauce of your choice, Boucan bbq, honey mustard and bbq and white sauce.   The place is always crowded on the weekends and Friday nights. They do take reservations so reserve in advance because its tiny. It's tiny but cozy and rustic which is so my style. ( not fancy ) At some point they dimmed the lights and it made the atmosphere somewhat romantic and with some southern comfort and bourbon in my drink, I felt really comfy.   To finish off, The buttermilk pie served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is not describable so you are going to have to try it because its worth it."}
{"text":"My experience likely would have been different if it wasn't for the server. Nothing is worse than someone making you feel stupid for asking a question.  As an example, my girlfriend asked for a better knife to cut into her chicken (she only had a butter knife). Our server gave us a look that made us feel dumb for asking and he answered back something along the lines of, \"That knife should work fine.\" He eventually did get a better knife for her, but that isn't really something he should be arguing. Get a better knife - it's a simple request.   He was also rude when she asked a simple question about having gluten free bread. It wasn't a judgement, just a question. We weren't expecting them to have gluten free buns or bread, but making us feel dumb for asking isn't what we're looking for.   The food was spot-on, can't deny that. The rest of the staff seemed quite nice, too. First impressions go a long way, and our server simply didn't do his job.   Beyond that, it's a bit small but those are the only negatives. Not the best barbecue I've ever had, but certainly top 5.   I hope you have a better server if you try this place."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  Nothing crazy.  I liked the mac n cheese with the ribs.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Amazing smokehouse! There are a lot of choices of accompaniments with the dishes so definitely take the smoked corn. It was so good! I had the 5 Napkin Burger and the others had the Chicken. The dishes were really good."}
{"text":"J'avais été à cet endroit pour la fête d'un ami et je dois dire que je suis bien content de ma visite. C'est très hamburger, sans être trop fast food. Les frites sont les meilleures en ville selon ma blonde, elles ont un petit goût BBQ.  Si vous êtes plus cochons, leurs ribs sont très bonnes, sinon vous pouvez opter pour un bon hamburger. Pas trop cher et de la bonne malbouffe avec une bonne bière."}
{"text":"I left disappointed. And disappointed that I was disappointed if that makes any sense.   I wanted to love this place. I fist saw it on the TV show The Opener where (somewhat) celebrity Chef David Adjey help these 3 sweet guys open their first restaurant. I can see that most of what they put on the menu remains today.   So I ordered the burger, and it was just boring. Like a burger from Chenoys would be. One of my friends had it as well and we felt exactly the same. There was some mystery meat on top of the patty, maybe bacon, but it was raw. My 3 other friends had the chicken and all thought it was real dry. Everything else about this joint was cool, the decor, waitresses, terrace, etc...  I will give it another try when someone suggests it. This friendly lady started up a conversation with me as I waited for my table. She recommended the pulled pork and the poutine. Next time I'll listen to her.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Bon resto dans le quartier Rosemont nous avons réservé en après-midi pour la soirée même tout a bien été par contre la place était tout prêt de la porte d'entrée principale et il y avait un bon courant d'air froid. Le service était assez rapide et la nourriture bonne!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Perfectly cooked rack of ribs with a couple of sides (house salad was especially tasty, French fries are French fries) but the music was WAY too loud. We were one group of 20 or so, in a place that fits maybe 35 ppl, with no one else there, and we all had to yell to talk. I'd give it five bases on the food, but I hate loud music with food."}
{"text":"Quelle bonne côte levée à la mode du sud des états. Les bourbons sont excellents et il y a un bon choix. Le service, lui, est remarquable alors qu'on vit une expérience d'un établissement artisanal. Si, on aime les côtes levées et le poulet de grains, on se trompe pas."}
{"text":"Pas à mon goût les reviews m'on tromper dur ce restaurant .  Le mac and cheese sa sans cheese et sel  Le burger 5 napkin le seul bon choix La salade de patate si tu aime pas l'aneth prend en pas  Le mais heuu  pas bon on dirait qui avait de la biere dans le mélange ou du vin je sais pas mais le goût je l'aimais pas  La salade de chou était acide vaut mieux aller au st-hubert ou acheter celui du marché  Les cotes levée pas pire mais j'ai déja gouté mieux  Si je retournerais la bas -Non !  Eau servie était chaud ! Mais un bon staff ,bon concept"}
{"text":"Absolutely fun place to eat and drink in cozy neighborhood of Montreal.  The salmon was cooked to perfection.  Came with wonderful fries that had a balance of cajun spice and southern sweetness. Cheese corn was decent, but not spectacular. The vibe was amazing which made the meal even more enjoyable.  Drinks were outstanding - the buffalo trace is definitely their specialty.  Pisco is ABA pisco, which is a decent Chilean pisco, but preparation of the pisco sour was slightly off, but bartender was willing to tweak to a better result.  Service is phenomenal - chatted me up about my hometown and gave great tips on places to go in Montreal. Other patrons were equally friendly. Simply a wonderful evening for good food in a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"One of my favourite addictions in MTL. Cozy restaurant with fantastic food and friendly staff who always give outstanding service. Love the ribs, mac n cheese, pulled pork poutine, burgers, salmon and smoked tomato soup. Just discovered they have brunch on weekends!"}
{"text":"Nice little smokehouse. The pulled pork poutine was good and I was impressed to find they had Alabama style white sauce which is hard to find even in the US. They also have Turkey 101 so I was pleased."}
{"text":"Off night? Maybe. The restaurant was me and maybe a handful of people. Got pulled pork at the bar which was mmmm fine but the fries that were under it were rather ummm room temperature. The service? I don't think she could be bothered."}
{"text":"I saw a picture of the ribs a few years ago and I've always wanted to try this place out. I didn't hesitate to finally go in when I happened to be in the area last week. We were two and shared a pulled pork poutine with a rack of ribs. I think the poutine was very well made and tasty. While the ribs were very tender and had plenty of sauce on them, I felt that it lacked a bit of flavour. Maybe it needed more marinating. The corn had a funny taste to it...I couldn't tell what it was or why, but it tasted like artificial flavour to me for some reason. Overall an ok place."}
{"text":"I got the \"pit boss\" with beers Pros: Nice large wood plate with a sample of everything that I wanted all to taste so it was perfect choice. The ribs were excellent, the chicken was very tender and juicy, not so salty. The pork was good, potato salad awesome ad ok coleslaw. Cons: Sat at the end of the bar, the barmaid was putting all the drinks going out to tables in front of me, I got to hear the employees and manager bitch about customers that came late, got to see the siting table chart on the counter in front of me, got to hear the employees giving a hard time to the new employee, yet, really not the best place to sit in the house. I would have to go again and sat far from the end of the bar or at a table to have a real dinner experience.  Lack of customer service and care."}
{"text":"Oh wow the best mac and cheese and ribs Ive ever had. What a feast. It's a bit pricier than you'd expect for comfort food but it's delicious. In the summer, the back terrace is cosy, and I liked the vintage music playing, I even recognized some of the songs. I had a great time and am saving up to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is fine but really does not compare to BBQ in the US. The staff is super friendly, and the ambience is alright. I enjoyed the food, but didn't love it. I think it lacked some flavor or dipping sauces or something...  I really enjoyed my cocktail which I recalled being a warm apple cider beverage."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you love true southern BBQ....this is it! The best ribs I have ever had. Too find a great smokehouse like this gem in Montreal was bonus! The pulled pork Poutine was top notch."}
{"text":"This place has the best brisket in Montreal hands down. I come here every chance I get. The Wings and Ribs are great as well"}
{"text":"Good bbq! Everything, even the sides are really tasty. Great pulled pork. Wish I'd had room left for the bacon brownie. Good atmosphere, cool staff!"}
{"text":"TLDR: Juicy delicious food and dynamic servers.  Small restaurant that serves big flavour. I was torn on what to order, but in the end I went with the 5 napkin burger with the cheesy corn and coleslaw. The two juicy 4 oz patties (8oz total) was topped with pickles, 12-hour smoked bacon, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and bbq sauce. It was huge and I definitely required more than 5 napkins to keep my hands clean. The flavours were on point, and I enjoyed every bite of it. I ordered the cheesy corn because I wanted to know what it was, and while it was tasty I regretted not choosing the fries. The slaw was a nice and refreshing contrast to the rest of the hearty and heavy meal.  The servers were a delight, and we had a lovely conversation about spicy peppers with them. I would definitely go back to Le Boucan the next time I'm craving some BBQ."}
{"text":"I love stopping in at Le Boucan every time I visit MTL. Tasty soul food in a casual, retro space. The menu is straightforward and the food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I went here the other week with my gf, and was very happy with the place. It's got a cool bar and an out-door section in the back, but isn't really that big overall.  We had the Mac 'N Cheese entree. It was OK, but since I'm Australian (and didn't grow up with the whole North-American-imitation-cheese-fixation) it wasn't life-changing.  I had the 5 Napkins burger which was good. For the two sides (which you get with every meal) I had fries and corn, which made the meal massif and pretty good value. I really liked the (rib?) sauce on the burger - it was nice and smokey, which shouldn't be surprising as they bill themselves as a smokehouse.  The guys next to us had the Pit Boss, and it looks like it would go hard. I'd like to come back and try it. It had pulled pork, ribs, half a chicken, and a few different sides. All of it was covered in the rib sauce, which I totally rate.  Will go back here at some stage. It wasn't the cheapest, but good quality and still value for money. I'd really like to try the Bacon Brownies.  For the guys: the waitresses here were really hot, and I almost gave them another star just for that. If you're catching up with some mates, go here and get the Pit Boss and check out the waitresses.  For the ladies: umm, the decor was... nice? I don't really know, I was too busy checking out the waitresses to notice."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious here, the service a bit to be desired.   We walked into a pretty empty restaurant on a Wednesday at 6:30. The bartender greeted us and asked if we had a reservation. When we said no and inquired if we needed one she shrugged, sighed and then pointed us to a table.  No other tables came in while we were there, roughly 45 minutes.   I asked if they still had red stripe (beer) on the menu and she informed me she didn't but tried to guide me to other red beers that I would like. When I asked if she had any pale lagers she looked at me funny and continues to offer me red beers, almost confused as to why I'd ask for a pale beer. Red stripe is a pale lager and not a red but oh well. #beersnob   The waitress that brought our food was very pleasant and smiley.   We ordered a pulled pork poutine and Mac and cheese; Both REALLY good, however the poutine doesn't come with a lot of fries or cheese but still really good. For a dollar more you can get their home made habanero sauce and it's DELICIOUSLY SPICY and compliments the Mac and cheese nicely.   Good food, probably caught the bartender on a bad day which sucks but happens, would go again tho."}
{"text":"I went there with friends, we all the pulled pork poutine. It was one of the best we have ever had. The french fries were a little bit thinner than the normal size but the cheese was super good. We ended up getting some very good shooters, be careful with the spicy one, it's really hot!"}
{"text":"Tldr: poor service, mediocre food  After seeing the previous reviews, I figure that what I'm about to say isn't necessarily indicative of the restaurant. I'd like to make sure that everyone understands even businesses and those in the creative profession have off days. That being said, here was my experience at Le Boucan:  After being seated with only two other tables occupied, it took about 15 minutes for us to get our menus. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but there was only one server and she was also tending bar. We ordered the pulled pork poutine and the half chicken. The food prep took only about 15 minutes, but I saw the window where the food was sitting from.my table, and it ended up sitting in the window, drying under the heat lamps for another 15 minutes.  When we finally got the food, the white meat of the chicken was dry and inedible without the accompanying bbq sauce. The dark meat was moist, but flavorless. The side of potato salad was flavorful and unfortunately was the best thing we had there. The side of coleslaw was surprisingly flavorless. I didn't know it was possible to make coleslaw so flavorless. It was almost as if it wasn't dressed in anything but water. That coleslaw will now make me question every coleslaw I see on a menu.  The poutine was good, but nothing special.  I don't leave reviews unless I'm really disappointed or really thrilled about a restaurant, and unfortunately, Le Boucan is in the former."}
{"text":"This is a boys restaurant! Strong drinks and meaty menu. Pretty much confort food with nachos, huge burgers, ribs and pulled pork. I think it would probably be a fun place for a bunch of guys to party after a game!"}
{"text":"Aucun service. Après 10 minutes d'attente dans le restaurant sans client, la serveuse est restée devant son ordinateur/caisse. Elle ne m'a jamais regardé ni parlé. Je vous recommande le restaurant junior qui est tout près."}
{"text":"This is my favorite smokehouse bbq restaurant. I've tried bar-b-barn's but this one is better. the seasoning and sauce is really good and the texture is great. I know a guy who used to work here and he showed me this place. it was worth it.  I recommend coming here if you like southern style smokehouse restaurants."}
{"text":"Alors que je me rendais a un spectacle, nous avons décidé d'essayer Le Boucan dont on avait entendu beaucoup de bien et qui avait également participer à l'émission ''Le Restaurateur''.  Nous avons été impressionnés par la qualité de la nourriture, beaucoup de saveur et bien épicé. L'ambiance était décontractée et l'accueil a été très chaleureux ! La musique blues en arrière-plan, tout était vraiment excellent !  Une très belle découverte et j'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner !"}
{"text":"I really wasn't sure what to give Le Boucan for a rating after my experience here.  Read on and you'll see why.  It was a Friday night when we came here and though it was empty when we showed up at six it was packed when we left.  The restaurant is small so a reservation would be a really good idea.  Being Friday I figured I would get a cocktail so I started with a mint Julep.  The cocktails seem expensive here but they are very strong so I feel the price was justified.  I followed it up with a Moscow Mule which was a little to heavy on the lime for me.  I prefer the ginger to stand out more in this particular cocktail.  There is also a decent selection of bourbons for you to try out and they usually have one on special.  We were four and we split the Pit Boss which gives you a chance to try a bit of everything.  It included chicken, ribs, pulled pork, coleslaw, potato salad and fries.  For me the winner was the pulled pork which was very tender and juicy.  I also thought that the chicken was well seasoned and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The ribs though were a little on the dry side.  I would suggest that if you're going to get this dish only do it if you're two or three people tops and our waitress did say it was meant for that number of people.  I wasn't very hungry so it was a decent amount of food but if I had been hungrier it probably wouldn't have been.  Now had we stopped after the Pit Boss I would have given Le Boucan four stars easily.  I had enjoyed the food up until then and in all I was having an enjoyable experience.  However, we thought we would split a plate of nachos which turned out to be a total ripoff.  For $16 (which is already expensive for nachos) the portion was pathetically tiny.  Normally I am not one to complain in restaurants unless the food is undercooked, cold or something is seriously wrong with the flavour but this was ridiculous.  We brought this to the attention of our waitress and she took it back to the kitchen to try and see if she could get more chips or something added to it.  At this point the manager came over and tried to explain why the nachos had to be so expensive.  She offered to discount the price %50 for us which we agreed to but when she went to see if the nachos were still in the kitchen they had been tossed.  Needless to say we were all a little miffed by the time everything was said and done.  I'm not really sure what to make of my experience here.  Like I said if we had just stopped after our main meal I would have no trouble recommending this place.  Also if the nachos hadn't been tossed I would have been a little more forgiving and probably given the restaurant three stars."}
{"text":"It's a small limited menu but what they do, they do well. I think a steak option would have been nice. Lots of pork, chicken, and the requisite Montreal poutine. Great and I mean GREAT coffee. Bacon brownie and Buttermilk pie aren't made in-house but are very good. Excellent service too"}
{"text":"The food is good, that's for sure, but I look for a full experience - food, atmosphere and service, and the other two were lacking.   We liked that there was fun 80s music playing, but we were awkwardly squeezed into a middle table where we were constantly in the waiter's way and a bit too close to tables next to us. The service is almost too fast to enjoy the experience of eating out - the food came only 5-10 minutes after ordering. (When I called to make a reservation, they told me we would have 2 hours - I think we were there about 45-minutes).  Lastly, the waiter looked like me like I was an alien whenever I asked a question/request, such as: \"Can I please have a knife?\" Apparently, that's an odd request, even when you have a huge chicken breast to eat. It was just odd service.   In the end, there are places I can go that have good food, atmosphere and service, so I wouldn't choose Le Boucan again."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Montreal, and my lab mate and I were looking for the perfect place to get some cocktails,  some poutine, and basically stuff our faces.   We ended up splitting a pitcher of red sangria which was just the right amount for 2 people to get a good buzz while eating absurd amounts of meat. It also was the perfect amount of fruit to wine without having that harsh acidic taste some red sangria has.   She got the full order of pulled pork poutine, and I helped finish it because it was ENORMOUS. You can tell the pork is smoked, it tastes amazing even if it wasn't smothered in the perfect amount of house bbq sauce, gravy and cheese curds.   I got 16 of the smoked wings with the mustard (basically like a classic honey mustard style bbq from South Carolina) and the house bbq. I couldn't pick a favorite, but my hands were a clear indication of how much I enjoyed the wings when I was done. I needed all the wet wipes the table had to offer. Also, the wings were smoked to perfection - still juicy and with perfectly done skins. I liked that the sauce was on the side so you could taste how good they were solo.   Also the staff was super friendly! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a small and cozy restaurant at first sight, but there is apparently seating out in the back too.  Our server was friendly, spoke English, and looked like Ryan Gosling.  We had a little bit of everything: Wings, ribs, chicken, pulled pork, fries, potato salad, coleslaw, and mac n cheese.  I have been going to quite a few rib festivals this year and i have to say that the ribs here were one of the best, if not the best, I've had all summer. Everything was delicious. I will definitely come back and recommend the place to anybody in Montreal."}
{"text":"Pit boss all the way. That sauce - I could drink it. The place is quite small so I recommend booking reservations and specify you want a table and not to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for lunch with another meat-loving buddy of mine. We went straight for sharing the Smoked Pork Meatballs and the Pit Boss Platter, ribs, chicken, pulled pork, fries, coleslaw and potato salad. I ordered a Mint Julep and buddy ordered a Mojito.   First off, we came in for a very late afternoon lunch so we basically almost had the entire place to ourselves, no issues with service or delays or anything. The waitress was very friendly. Food and drinks-wise, drinks were fabulous and while I do enjoy BBQ, it's not something I can eat everyday, the sauce the amount of food involved is too rich and too heavy. Having said that, the ribs here are great, can't go wrong with them, ditto the pulled pork. This is just me but I prefer my chicken with really crispy skin, which it isn't here. I also found that there was something sweet on the french fries, not sure if their fries spice mix includes sugar, but I really don't think it's needed.  There has been a plethora of smoke houses and American-style BBQ joints popping up all over Montreal and having a bit of a sweet tooth, I always scan the dessert offerings. I saw the Bacon Brownie but I think that's a little too much meat-overkill. I was stuffed so didn't get to try anything out, but I still have yet to find a Montreal place that offers Hummingbird Cake and a proper Southern Chocolate Mud Pie. Oh well. The search continues."}
{"text":"Not too noisy on the terrasse. Very interesting experience. Wide variety of refreshments."}
{"text":"En fin de semaine, je suis allée au Boucan avec mon australien pour une sortie relaxe entre amoureux. Pendant le souper, on débatait le nombre d'étoiles que l'endroit devrait mériter.  On a adoré l'ambiance, autant pour le décor que le personel de service et le choix de musique. Nos plats (macaronis au fromage, guédille de porc et hamburger 15 feuilles) ont été simplement délicieux. Même les à-côtés (frites, salade verte, salade de patates et maïs au fromage) sont à s'en lécher les babines et les doigts. C'était tellement bon qu'on n'a pas eu assez de place pour essayer le brownie au bacon (oui, oui, j'ai bien dis bacon) qui fera partie de notre prochain essai j'espère.  J'ai donc décidé de donner 5 étoiles parce bien qu'on ne parle pas de gastronomie du type \"étoiles Michelin\", je n'ai absolument rien à reprocher à l'endroit, Même les salles de bains sont belles! Le Boucan est un resto aux saveures du sud des États (du bon soul food) qui donne le meilleur de soi-même, ni plus, ni moins."}
{"text":"A friend brought us here for dinner and we loved it! My boyfriend spent a lot of time as a kid in North Carolina and loves BBQ -- even he was impressed. The portions are generous, the waitstaff friendly and gracious, and the atmosphere welcoming. While everything was delicious (including the mac and cheese, ribs, the must-order pulled pork poutine), a special shout out goes to the potato salad which really hit the spot. I don't know what they put in it, but it reminds me of everything good and holy in the world. My only disappointment was that I was too full for dessert."}
{"text":"Ive being going to the Boucan for years! This is real BBQ with a quebec flavor!! The place stands alone in montreal for its great food good staff and nige setting! Must go BBQ in montreal!! Made me think of memphis style bbq"}
{"text":"Last month, for the event of my birthday, I was looking for a nice relaxed spot to enjoy a great meal amongst friends and perhaps have a few drinks along the way. After decided that (of course) the Burgundy Lion was the happy hour spot we would start at, Le Boucan seemed like the ideal location to continue the evening. It certainly helped that we could simply walk over from the pub... also I just love BBQ. I had only been once prior and quite honestly the events of that first visit are quite hazy for some reason or another. Because of that, I was quite excited to \"re-try\" Le Boucan.  Located on a strip of Notre-Dame street that is quite literally booming, Le Boucan is a relatively small restaurant inside that was a nice terrasse out back to enjoy in the summer time. The interior has a rustic barn look - red wood panels on the walls, sliding barn doors at the washrooms, worn wood signs and hand drawn menu boards. The key focus point inside is the bar area with all the bourbon bottles exposed to the patrons to see. It is a very relaxed and enjoyable ambience.  Le Boucan is a smokehouse so the menu is all BBQ - pulled pork, ribs, etc. On the drink side, they have a full bar menu with a particular focus on bourbon cocktails. As a starter, we ordered a pitcher of bourbon lemonade because well... I'm completely hooked to the stuff and can't ignore it when it is on a menu. This particularly version of it was quite good - not as sweet of many variants around town but definitely the strongest in terms of bourbon which was perfect for our evening.... but which made the second pitcher ordered later on a little more problematic...  Needed a bit of food now, we grabbed some entrees. First up was a plat of Le Boucan's Nachos which I forgot to take a picture of..... either way, excellent plate of nachos with quite a nice amount of toppings over top. Sadly, you will just have to take my word for it. One of my friends ordered the meat balls. Topped with some scallions and served with some croutons and sauce, the meatballs were nice and moist. Nice flavour to them as well.  I myself ordered the mac n' cheese. Served in a onion soup bowl, topped with some scallions and some bread crumbs, it was a nice macaroni however the cheese sauce was not creamy enough for my personal tastes. As such, the cheese didn't stick to the macaroni itself very well. The cheese sauce had a nice rich flavour at least but wasn't really one of my favourites.  For the mains, most of us wanted to order some pulled pork however our waitress informed us that they had run out! Not cool so we worked around it. However, they had enough for one dish so one of us got the pulled pork poutine. Such a heavenly combination - beautifully tender pork with nice fries, cheese curds and some gravy. I would come back for this dish alone.... I guess I just need to make sure to reserve my portion early when I dine later.  Given the lack of pulled pork, I went for the full rack of ribs with fries and cheesy corn. The fries were solid and the cheesy corn is a play on creamed corn which I enjoyed. The real star of course were the ribs. A massive portion of ribs - tons of meat on the bones with a good crust on them. No knife required to remove the meat here... that is the level of tenderness we are talking about. Very nice all around.  The only other different main on the table was the rib and chicken combo with the side of potato salad. The chicken was nicely smoked - tender and juicy with a nice smoky flavour. The potato salad was pretty good as well - more on the chunky side of things but still creamy enough. A solid dish all around. Dessert was tempting but frankly at this point, we were too full to even consider the options. That will have to wait until next time.  Le Boucan was a solid evening of delicious BBQ and drinks - the perfect setting to celebrate me getting another year older. Our group of 7 walked out happy and contend which is all I could ask more on this evening. BBQ in Montreal is getting better and better - Le Boucan has a solid spot in the best this city has to offer... thankfully I can remember enjoying it this time.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Place is fine. My favourite item is their chicken wings - nicely smokey and spiced. Their mustard sauce goes well with this. All other items are average though. I usually also order their mac 'n cheese with the wings and am slightly disappointed. Venue is reasonably nice though I mostly order delivery - not on my short list of go-to restos (even in the casual class)."}
{"text":"Le burger cinq-napkin est super bon, accompagné d'une bière fraiche... Équipe sympathique et très bon service."}
