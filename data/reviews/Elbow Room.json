{"text":"This place is just plain Awful!!! I had not been there in 10 years. I ordered the baked cod special with green beans. The green beans came right out of a can and were cold. The cod was the size of a pinkie finger and had not one ounce of flavor. They had the nerve to charge$8.60! I could have had two giant fish sandwiches at my local legion for that price. My Mother had fried cauliflower. It came right out of a box and you could barely chew it. She also had liver and onions which used to be excellent and it was awful. This place has really gone downhill and I will never return. There are many nicer and finer places to go in the area and a lot cheaper! Chef Ramsey would have a stroke if he ate there!!  Stay Away!!!!!"}
{"text":"Three tries and all three were not very enjoyable. We had fantastic company all three times, but unfortunately the bad food and poorly trained staff distracted from the conversation. The only good part is the beautiful building."}
{"text":"I love this place. It gave me one of my most memorable kindergarten memories, graduation after party. Fast service and very good food. But it isn't five star worthy."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of the pizza like everyone else in McKeesport is but they do have a decent steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent experience from start to finish! I had the Buttermilk chicken and waffles - amazing! Looking forward to coming back and working my way through the other menu options!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with some friends...I had the stuffed rigatoni which was ok, although I did get sick that night. My friends had a meatball sub and spaghetti/meatball...the meatballs were gross! They looked black and not even like meat...tasted really odd too. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"What a great lunch! I'm glad they offer the \"lunch experience\" that allows you to choose 1 veg, 1 protein and 1 starch because it was too hard to choose just one thing!  The smoked chicken agnolotti was simply delicious but the flaky mushroom flatbread was a close second, paired with a light tomato salad, it made an awesome meal. We were pleasantly surprised that we also received two small cinnamon beignets in a takeout bag.   It's a smaller space but modern & sunny where the tables aren't so jammed in that you feel like you sitting with strangers. The set up is just right.  The service was attentive without being overwhelming. We were able to chat for a of couple hours without being made to feel rushed.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the overwhelming and continual smell of brussel sprouts. Yuck. But it's clearly one of their popular vegetable dishes. Not my thing but too each their own. It definitely won't stop me from coming back!  See you again Elbow Room."}
{"text":"Wow awesome food small place very modest ok service but the food is worth the trip ..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and a late lunch. Tried the chicken bites and the chick pea fries. The bites were ok (not recommended, very bland) and the fries were great, especially liked the jalape√±o dip. The upstairs patio is awesome, great Southern exposure. They really need to have a rule about staff changing for work at the restaurant. We really didn't need to see the guy doing up his pants next to the bar as he got ready for his shift and the other staff member carrying an arm full of clothes through the restaurant to the restroom did nothing to add to the ambiance. Had to laugh at the bartender, he was telling the servers that there was no Worcester sauce for the Caesars he was making. Really????? You are less than 100 metres from a grocery store, show some initiative and go buy some! Great potential here just need some better management."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed with this restaurant.  I read the reviews before going and was quite excited.   The food was too rich and salty.  For the main, we had the char siu pork - double order of $35 each.  It was not worth $70 at all.   The pork was dry and flavoring was strange.  The pork was on a pattie of fried up rice (same pattie that Blue Fin Sushi uses for their sushi pizza).   The beet salad was ok, but there was more green then beets."}
{"text":"This is Pittsburgh local family dining at it's finest!!  You're not gotta get fine cuisine at this place but you can get just about anything else!  Steaks, pizza, cheesesticks, pork chops, city-chicken (pork on a stick).  It is NOT FANCY (chicken parm here is 4 or 5 chicken strips covered in marinara and cheese) but decent & the prices are right.  Full bar with cheap drinks.  The atmoshere & my favorite waitress ever, Inez, really make this place for me.  Beyond their usual pirate ship/ adventurer decor, they cheesily decorate for every season.  God, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Elbow room square pizza is like none other in the area, it has a light crispy crust I love mine with double toppings and extra cheese! The steak sandwich is also very good it is a steak on a bun, who wouldn't love that?"}
{"text":"Awful food. Found a hair in my pizza. Rude service. Don't know why this place this exists. Barely any cars in the lot. Should have been a sign that we should have went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic first time eating at the Elbow Room. The food was excellent: good sized portions and perfectly seasoned. The wait staff was extremely keen, knowledgeable and attentive as well as efficient.   The standouts for me were the brussel sprout starter and the fire roasted octopus which had such a perfect degree of doneness and texture, I could go on and on about it.   The space is bigger than it seems from the outside, especially the patio on the top floor, and looks cool. The ambiance is a little on the noisy side for a quiet dinner, but it's fun and lively.   This was our first time to the Elbow Room, and we will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up at this restaurant.  My son and his two friends were kept waiting for 20+ minutes without being seated and quite a few empty tables and spaces at the bar.  When they approached the hostess as if the tables were reserved, they were told no. When they asked if they could be seated, the hostesses just looked at each other and said \"no\", with no further explanation.  So they left, and enjoyed a wonderful evening at a competing establishment in the same area.  Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Elbow Room after seeing it on Avenue magazine's 2018 list of Calgary's 25 best restaurants.   We ordered the \"Elbow Room Experience\", which we assumed was a prix fixe meal. It wasn't -- it was actually one big serving platter with two servings of four different dishes heaped on top of it.  I don't normally talk about how food is presented in my reviews, but it's super relevant in this case. I had nothing against getting everything in one shot, but I discovered that there's a pretty significant downside to it. As you'd expect, everything was nice and warm when it was served, but by the time we'd worked our way through half of the small mountain of food, the remainder was cold, and a little unappetizing.   At least the carbonara, and accompanying charred broccolini, was quite tasty. The other components of the meal (prawns, salmon, and lobster-topped steak) were slightly disappointing in their blandness.   All in all, it was an inoffensive dinner. I wouldn't object to going back, but I wouldn't return on my own initiative. I think Elbow Room's inclusion on Avenue's list of Calgary's best restaurants reflects poorly on Calgary's dining scene, Avenue magazine, or both.  Oh, and Yelp says Elbow Room's attire is \"dressy\". It's not -- everyone around us was dressed quite casually, and there were several cheerful infants and toddlers in attendance. I don't have any problem with that, but don't dress up for a meal here."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place with my boyfriend for a pit stop. Didn't know what a waste of money it was going to be. Wouldn't recommend it. Felt awful after eating here. Find something else around the area. Not worth it."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to Calgary's dining scene! I know it's damn good when I say \"mmmm wow\" after every bite. The happy hour bites and drinks are awesome and I can't wait to go back to try more dishes. Super friendly atmosphere with a trendy but laid back vibe. They also have a gorgeous south facing patio that I'll be sitting on as soon as the weather allows!"}
{"text":"Typical neighborhood joint with locals discussing current events. Full bar but pretty much just domestics available beer-wise. It gets pretty smoky in the bar area but there is a non-smoking dinning room. The service is adequate but I wouldn't say you get welcomed with open arms.   The main reason to come here is for an inexpensive meal or for the pizza. Especially the pizza... Its pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This is my new guilty pleasure.  Had take out fried chicken last night with fries and gravy for the first time, but not the last.  The chicken was moist and tender and super crispy.  I would kill for this chicken...ok, maybe not kill but seriously injury!  The fries were pretty standard.  The gravy was so good.  We also had the brussel sprouts and broccolini.  The bao buns - pillowy soft bread surrounding tender but crispy pork jowls.  I think I would've been happy just eating these.  Sorry, no pics...because I was too busy eating this deeelicious meal.  Maybe next time.  I can tell, we're going to be good friends!"}
{"text":"Nice little place that clearly is having growing pains in its first few weeks.  Reso was at 7, didn't get seated till 8!!  Apps where good but rather expensive for what you got.13$ for what amounted to one tomato and shaved cheap feta is unacceptable.   Presentation for the main course was spot on but the execution of the dish was subpar (you'd think with all the butter they used in the cod dish, they wouldn't cheap out on salt and pepper)  Kitchen was too backed up to order dessert so we had to leave. Server was fantastic.   Would recommend holding off for a month or two till they get systems down before trying."}
{"text":"Everything was good EXCEPT the butter marinated steak which is what the waitress told us they were known for.   We asked for one to share medium rare and it was very well done.   But when our waitress discovered this she removed it from our bill and the rest of the food was so good we did not leave hungry.  I was having dinner with my sister and as we left they gave us one small bag of cotton candy?!  Really didn't know what to do with that?"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with the pizza...I had heard the pizza here was pretty good, so I decided to take the long way home from work and pick a couple of pizzas up for pizza night.   First, I paid almost thirty bucks for two twelve cut pizzas that were not very big at all -which isn't a bad thing if the pizzas are great. These pizzas definitely aren't great. I don't mind paying for good pizza (Mineo's, Fiori's).    Second, man are they skimpy with the cheese. Hardly any cheese at all on the pies...made for a messy experience while eating..nothing but sauce.   Third, the crust was REALLY tough..I actually had to grab a hold of the pizza with my teeth and tear off my \"bites\". Frustrating way to eat pizza.  The pizza had decent flavor, but the above mentioned comments made for a negative experience. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant but unfortunately was horribly disappointed in the food. The croquettes were completely OVER COOKED and so hard to bite into! The tiger shrimp had potential but was lacking in flavour. The cod cheek was supposed to come with lentils instead they substituted potatoes which were UNDER COOKED. The chicken entree was ok but the plating made the meal unappetizing with orange mash under the chicken. The service was ok and the ambience was nice however, there won't be a return trip in my future."}
