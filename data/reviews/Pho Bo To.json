{"text":"Great place to get some Pho! Delicious food and great drinks! Had the Beef Pho and the taste was quite authentic, the only drawback was the portion for a large and extra large were the same? Which was not too much. It's a mom and pop place so the service is very friendly and makes you feel welcome. It is also their weak point as they have to multi-task so the service is slower."}
{"text":"One thing that really makes Pho Bo To stand out is that it has quite a few vegetarian options.  In a lot of Viet places it's almost impossible to find something that doesn't have meat, but Pho Bo To has a whole page of vegetarian options.  The place is clean, the service is good,  and the food is tasty it's definitely one of the better Vietnamese places in the area."}
{"text":"It tastes like an other authentic Vietnamese restaurant to me! Really appreciate that there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Been to better pho places. Servings weren't as much as other places and price is just the same if not higher. The place is clean though.  Service is a little slow."}
{"text":"I ordered rare beef and beef balls pho. The broth was alright but the noodle wasnt the authentic type, it was the dried kind which was thicker and not as soft to eat. For a large (6.50) you dont get much, maybe 5 pieces of beef and 3 beef balls. It's a decent place but definitely not 4 star material, sorry. But... they had good music at least?"}
{"text":"I guess there's a large Viet community out in the west end, as this place is situated in a litte strip mall with a variety of viet business's including a supermarket.  Now I know where to go when I need to make an emergency Pho pit, when I'm someone in the west end or on the 401.  This quick drive down Black Creek Drive puts you right at one of the better Pho places I've been to in a while.  The clientele is so eclectic here as I've seen hipster chicks, this elderly eastern eurpoean couple, and traditional viet families.  I guess the word really is out about Pho.    The \"Special\" Pho is done perfectly with a mishmash of meaty goodness.  They have the mandatory required tripe, tendon and brisket with rare beef.  I'm salivating just thinking of it.  But what really puts this place over the top is the broth.  It's one of the more flavourful broth's that I've had in a long while.  It's also very consistent.  I've been there 3 times now, and each time has been a hit.  The place is run by the same two ladies that I've seen each time I've been there.  Their english is adequate, but service is amazlingly prompt.  The only thing that I HATE HATE HATE about this place is, they've had Kenny G playing in the background every single time I've been here.  I'm doing everything I can to not lower them one star for it, but for now the 4 star rating stays.... for now..."}
{"text":"I've came here once before with my husband and had their bun bo hue and it was good. My husband said his pho wasn't good so insisted we don't go back.  But today we were nearby and I was hungry and convinced him to go.   Boy was I disappointed, I order a bowl of pho with beef and tripe rice noodle soup and when it arrived at the table I thought the bowl was for a child portion. It was so small, it's not what a small size is at all your other pho places.  The pho was so little, beef was quite tough and chewy, the tripe was good. In addition they didn't even bother serving us tea and we didn't even bother asking.    We would never go back."}
{"text":"Pretty much our go to place for me and the bf, especially if we have been out all day and are looking for late eats. I am always craving the bbq pork on vermicelli. Comes with nhuc mam (fish sauce) which I could drink straight up it's so good...but I won't because I imagine it's not that healthy... (Truthfully, I get in a few slurps near the end. Yum, but Shh...)  Our typical order is one vermicelli dish, one pho (usually rare beef) and 4 shrimp and pork salad rolls.  The salad rolls are pretty standard, but they have been upgraded recently to include more spring onion and pork (used to only be shrimp). Good prices too, our bill for two dishes and app come in just over $20.  Great little place with just plain old good food and nice service. Food usually comes out fast too. They definitely have me as a regular customer. :)"}
{"text":"I've lived near this place for the majority of my life and never got around to trying it. I finally did and the Pho was the best I've had in quite some time! I will be back again. I do not recommend their smoothies though; I don't think they use fresh fruit-- at least not for the jackfruit flavour."}
{"text":"Good Pho! Nice place, it's clean, quaint, unassuming. Service is quick and friendly. Will be back for sure.  Decided to get crazy and order the Pickled Lime drink. I do not advise you follow my lead unless you like super salty drinks. Ew. lol."}
{"text":"WORST pho restaurant in Toronto! I ordered an extra large pho and I was shocked by its portion. I could pick up all noodle at once with chopsticks.  Price is also higher than most of other pho restaurants. I would never go to this awful restaurant again."}
{"text":"Pho Bo To has been my gf and myself's go to pho place since I started dating her. Its the closest to her parents and I think it is one of the best in Toronto. The lady that serves the place always has a smile on her face. The broth of the pho is pretty good. Tried ban coun and fairly decent. I have to say they are good for pho, but not so much for other items on the menu. They are one of the few that serves broken rice which is fairly authentic. Nothing special in the decor of the place either, but I do like coming back."}
{"text":"The pho here is great and the service is quick and friendly. Soup was fragrant. Some of the servers don't speak a lick of English though so you do need to be patient. The location is kind of a bummer too - tight to park. It's worth it for the food though. Only issue I had was they should put sweet clear sauce for the soup at the table too. My boyfriend and I liked it a lot overall. Hot sauce and fish sauce was at the table."}
{"text":"Really good pho restaurant in the area.   The soup was very fragrant.   I always order their beef brisket with tendon noodle and you can never go wrong with that.  They make one of the best tendons I have ever ate in Toronto.  (See photo attached).  Unlike other places I've been to, they only throw a few pieces of tendon in casually.   This one, she actually took the time and made it into a square; and traditionally, I have always remembered eating it this way.   The place is super clean.   Really friendly service.  It is our regular go to pho restaurant now."}
{"text":"With the colder weather coming, I always crave pho as a comfort food.  We come to Pho Bo To a lot.  It's proximity from our house and Hwy 401 makes it a pre or post road trip pit stop.  I'm a creature of habit so I always get the same thing - large pho with rare beef ($6.50). It comes with a nice helping of bean sprouts, a few chilis and basil.  I'm pho purist so I only put in the bean sprouts. I don't like to muddle the soup with sauces or other spices.  Service is decent and pho comes pretty quickly after ordering.  Plenty of parking in the lot and I can grab Asian groceries right next door."}
{"text":"Very very good. Been going here for 9 years. Excellent food and great staff. P13 large all the way"}
{"text":"Portions are relatively smaller than other pho places.  Not heavy on soup base, which is good.  Spring rolls are smaller than their competitors.  Service is fast. Place is clean. They can do some nice paint job to make the inside more attractive."}
