{"text":"Great hand pulled noodle place! Although the staff have limited english, service is quick and food is hot! We would have liked the portions to be a little larger, we did enjoy their flavour.   I would recommend the beef braised noodles And the fried seafood noddles (just shrimp)."}
{"text":"Delicious noodles and fast service. The quality of noodle is much better than magic tree noodle. It seems more home made and authentic. The soup was not too greasy and had the perfect flavor to it.  The beef rolls were so succulent and delicious! Must get if you come."}
{"text":"If you have not been here ... You should stop buy. Had the house special ... For $9 it was great ... No need to add anything to it. I love stereo them make the noodles in plain site. Also the kitchen is open.. so you know it's clean... Head down and have some noodles.."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars.  Ordered Dry Noodle with Pork and Eggplant. Noodle was good, but the sauce was more like a broth without too much flavour."}
{"text":"I come here every week for their FRESH MADE NOODLES!  IMPRESSION: When you walk in, the first thing you notice is chili in the air and the sounds of slapping noodles from the semi-open kitchen. Yup, get ready for some spiciness if you like that. If not, there are still plenty of non-spicy choices.    WHAT'S GOOD:   I've been going to Kung Fu since its opening (2016). What I really like about Kung Fu is their soft and chewy noodles! The texture is just right every time.   WHAT'S NOT SO GOOD:  The least thing I like about Kung Fu is not even about their food. It is their plastic drinking cups that are old and scratched up. I don't think I ever complaint about drinking cups, please do something about that soon. They just don't go with your classy noodles honestly, especially when noodles are served spicy and we need to frequently reach for more water.  THOUGHTS:  I think Kung Fu has a lot of potential to do well and even better in the noodles space if they're willing to consider more choices in their broths. Keeping it authentic is nice, but the taste across all their soup noodles is amazingly ALIKE which seems to become a bad thing. I came to this conclusion after trying all the soup noodles in the menu. Even the toppings and spiciness are different, all noodles taste very much the same in the end, which to me is bland. Keep up doing what you're good at but don't waste your amazing noodles for the sake of running an efficient restaurant."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine told me about this new restaurant.  I have been looking long and hard for authentic hand pulled noodles in GTA that matches Peaceful Restaurant (Vancouver) and Lan Zhou Noodles (Montreal).  Kung Fu Noodle is the best in GTA that I have tried.    The broad noodles had amazing chew.  The broth had lots of flavor (accomplished with minimal amount of sodium).  My wife had the stir fried noodle and we both thought there was much too much garlic in that dish.  Stick with the noodles in soup broth.  Restaurant is clean and service was excellent.  I am a fan and will be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the braised beef brisket with triangle noodles. The noodles were a bit chewy and the soup base tasted a little shallow. We also ordered the pork bone and that was a bit salty. Overall, a solid 3."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be Tofu House, interior is pretty much exactly the same as before with no visible renovations aside from the new logo and framed photos hung.  Food wise, unfortunately I really did not enjoy my beef ribs hand shaved noodle in soup.  My husband got the pork belly noodle soup, it was better than mine but still mediocore.  Mine was so salty and pungent that I had to switch with him half way. -Broth: my soup base tasted like water mixed with a load of seasoning.  An over abundant dose of curry or whatever yellow coloured spice.  Soup was oily and not appetizing. -Toppings: beef rib was sliced extremely thin and appears to be cooked via boiling, which left the meat very chewy.  Pork belly also sliced very small and there wasn't a lot of meat in the dish in general.  Comes with 2 pieces of shanghai bak choy.  Yhe extra tea eggs we ordered for $1 each was actually tasty. -Service: waitress was able to recommend what noodle to get, food came fast, it is what you would expect. -Noodle: yes, the noodle was authentically hand made and had good texture (similar to the noodle stand inside dragon legend buffet, though dragon legend is even better because they have the red and green types and better broth).  It's too bad the broth and toppings here ruined the experience.  Overall, I would not be returning or recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hidden gem if you're looking for a simple lunch that's very reasonably priced (~$7) and delicious. I ordered the crispy fried chicken knife shaved noodles. The noodles were hand made right in the kitchen, which was a pleasant surprise for a fast food court! The service was reasonably fast for the amount of prep work and cooking they had to do, and the owners were very pleasant to interact with. Just don't be expecting a quaint atmosphere inside a food court.   As for the noodles, they were boiled to a chewy consistency, which I personally liked. The broth was salted just right and was not too greasy, although flavour wise, it was a little plain and underwhelming. You also had the option to season it yourself with hot sauce, soy sauce and vinegar to your liking. The marinated egg and bok choi inside the noodles added well to the overall taste.   With my particular order, the crispy fried chicken was amazing! Although a little less seasoned than I preferred, the crispness was on point! It was also served separately so no need to worry about soggy fried chicken haha.  On top of the entire order, they also threw in a free tea. And all this for the price of $7! I would definitely recommend this place for  quick bite."}
{"text":"Yummy noodles.  Chewy and tasty.   Decor is not very fancy and wish the place is more spacious. Will return."}
{"text":"I stubbled upon this restaurant and popped in after reviewing other yelp reviews/photos. Im a visual person! We ordered 2 noodle soups, the fried tofu and the friend beef noodles. My favourite was the spicy braised beef noodle soup. The noodles are all hand pulled fresh so it was really good. I liked the texture, chew factor was on point not over done or over cooked. Even my kids loved it and they are picky eaters. I didnt love the beef slices in the fried noodles but everything else was good. Delivery was quick. Why they lost points was because I feel like there was a language barrier, there wasn't much talking and I felt like I was foreign. The \"house\" noodles contents and taste was meh.... They also forgot my drink I ordered so I just left it."}
{"text":"Similar to Magic Noodle, Kung Fu Noodle is known for the fresh hand made noodles. You can tell its fresh by the chewy texture of the noodles.   I've tried the authentic beef and the braised beef brisket (marked as mild spicy). The beef in authentic beef was good, not the best. I enjoyed the braised beef brisket more. The broth for both was similar and good but it needs more depth in flavour - adding chili oil helps.   Also had the flatbread wrap with beef - decent but not the best I had. The flatbread is thicker and softer than I like it to be. Stick with the noodles!  Good portion size - enough to get you filled, reasonable price and fast service. Highlight of this place is definitely the noodles."}
{"text":"If you're looking for northern chinese flavours, this place is it. I personally don't like northern chinese cuisine, but I think Kung Fu noodle seems pretty authentic. You get big portions for what you pay, so i think it's good value. The broth is very heavily seasoned though, so if you're the type that drinks all your soup, it might get too salty and you'll find yourself thirstier than before. The waitress was very enthusiastic and recommended the lamb skewers, but unfortunately I don't eat lamb. I actually prefer mei nung noodles next door, but it's not comparable as the flavours are very different."}
{"text":"Restaurant half full for weekend dinner.  Good service.  Noodle freshly made upon order.  Scared me when I first heard loud banging sound.  Most bowls are $8.99 and decent portion size.   Like that you can choose from many noodle size options.  We chose one soup noodle, one dry mix noodle and one rice combo.  Beef brisket soup noodle had good portion of meat.  The dry noodle had very little minced meat.  Lamb skewers were good and went well with rice.  Nice option within first markham place plaza."}
{"text":"The restaurant serves the best hand made noodles that I have ever had. The two owners are not cooks but CHEFS and their soup is to die for.  I frequent the restaurant twice a week and found every dish to be unique and superior in taste. Every dish that I ordered, I was never disappointed.  I am a Singaporean with a discerning taste for food and I highly recommend this restaurant.  It is affordable and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"The best thing about Kung Fu Noodle are... *drum roll*  ...The Noodles.   The noodles are made fresh in front of you in the semi-open kitchen. You can mix-n-match by choosing the thickness of the noodles. The texture is chewy but not tough. There is plenty of noodles in each bowl but if you're a big noodle consumer, you can request to have more noodles added when you make the order. The soup is quite salty so you'll probably have to ask for water multiple times.   The restaurant was not busy the past two lunch times I've been. The staff are friendly, and the service is fast. The cooks are quick to prepare the soup noodle dishes. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"A small restaurant opened up by a husband and wife and offers the same concept as Magic Noodle. I actually prefer this place more because the noodles were really chewy and the soup tasted good.   I order the House Special (soup noodle) with shaved noodle, Shredded Chicken (cold noodle), lamb skewer, and tofu skewer. Both noodles were fresh and tasted quite yummy, however I wished the Shredded Chicken would have more chicken! The tofu was good, but I've had better elsewhere. My mom really enjoyed it though! The lamb skewer was so-so. It lacked flavour and spice in my opinion.   The only downside I found was that both husband and wife only spoke Mando, which made it a little difficult to communicate with them so half the time I just pointed to whatever number was on the menu and even then, they had trouble understanding what I wanted. It was also annoying when the husband stood next to our table for the longest time but we weren't ready to place our order yet. The owners however were super nice and explained how to make the food more favourable (eg. Putting chilli oil onto the lamb skewers).   I felt bad when I asked to pack up the Shredded Noodle to take home 'cause we were all so full and they thought we didn't like it.   I'll definitely will be back again even if there is a slight communication barrier, lol! The price for each was decent and the portion was good."}
{"text":"Came during restaurant break hour.  Staff were  on break and eating lunch. Service was still prompt and courteous.  Menu prices are reasonable.   We'd ordered noodle dishes (some soup and stirfry).   Noodles were fresh and had great texture.  They were all flavorful. Hit the spot just right.    Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here in a party of 6 with no reservation and Kung Fu Noodle was very accommodating. I believe they serve Northern Chinese-style noodles here. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food that isn't Hong Kong-style but they won me over, first with their cute Kung Fu Panda logo and then with the hand-pulled noodles.   I ordered the very delicious #100 (house special) and would definitely have it again. Hand-pulled noodles, flavourful broth, a fried egg, beef, pork, bok choy and tripe. CILANTRO WARNING TO THE HATERS (me!)  The decor is nothing special but the kitchen is pretty open, so you can see/hear the chef hand pulling the noodles and slamming it on the counter.  The food is very reasonable ($8.99 for a generous bowl) and the staff are awesome, although there is a bit of a communication barrier. Thankfully one of my friends speaks Mandarin and helped us translate. Shout out to the owner for letting us bring in cakes from the bakery next door and providing plates/knives for us."}
{"text":"The noodles were : A1 - suhhh good. The chewiness and tenderness was perfect.   I ordered the Spicy Lanzhou Stretched noodle - a spicy dish on a cold day was perfect.  I totally dig the noodles here and they make them fresh in house.  It's also super cool to watch the chef actually be able to perform the traditional \"Kung Fu' Noodle making practices (hence the name)    The taste was really good as well. However, I really found my noodle soup broth wayyy too oily.  Which I really had to work around eating my meal.   They also serve non-noodle dishes and maybe i will try those next time, or a noodle dish that is not a soup noodle.  2 stars because the oil was over the top.  I'd bump it to 4 stars if it wasn't as oily"}
{"text":"First, be warned that the gentleman in the back pulling the noodles will sometimes make a loud noise (which is the noodles being smacked on the table). Doesn't go on for long it just can be startling if you don't know it's coming. Soup tasted really great and so did the noodles. However, I would suggest sharing a bowl. It is a lot of noodles and a lot of broth and meat. Neither me or my boyfriend could finish ours. But for the price it can't be bear."}
{"text":"Hand pulled noodle and the Chief is from the USA. I ate this kind of noodles in Shanghai before and this one is the best and highly recommended.  Cash or debit card only, huge portion of noodles with reasonable price."}
{"text":"Good service and tasty hand tossed noodle, lamb barbecue skewer is the best i ever had, good price. Nothing to complain, will come back."}
{"text":"Very bad ventilation.  They  beat the noodles in the dining hall without  screen so you get a temporary hearing loss. Maybe that is why the waitress speaks Sooooooo loudly.  The  soup  may look clear but it is very  heavily seasoned.  My pork belly hand shaved noodle had  an over dose of pepper,  cumin and  msg.  Hubby's house noodle had an overcoat of pepper and  msg. Cousin's lamb haggis noodle had an over dose of parsley.  The  contents are fridge bitten.  Hot water is served on plastic glasses with  cracks."}
{"text":"We were craving noodles and came across this place. It's in a huge plaza with many restaurants around but we decided to try here because our family recommended this place. We were not disappointed!   First off, the food is amazing. We ordered two noodle soups and tofu to share. The house noodle soup is extremely flavourful but the braised beef was too oily for us. The portion looks small in pictures but trust me one bowl will get you super full (there's only one size bowl but you can choose to add extra broth/noodles for extra $). For all you tofu lovers I recommend getting the Bbq tofu skewer. It's drizzled with Asian Bbq sauce and spices. Cheap and delicious with a bit of heat. The noodles are made in house and you can hear them smacking the noodles when preparing it. That's how you know it's fresh!   Service is excellent here. Our food came very quickly!! There was only one server on the floor but I noticed that the kitchen staff will come help by cleaning tables and bringing out the food quick so that it doesn't get cold. Our server mostly spoke Mandarin/Cantonese but she tried to recommend us food in English. A+ for effort and friendliness.   Overall I highly recommend this place. It's completely underrated for such delicious noodles."}
{"text":"First Markham place is where all Asian food gather. This is one of those new china noodle place that's been coming into the GTA. Same as the other, the noodle chef smack the dough all day long to tell you they are making fresh noodle. There is also a poster that said world first noodle. Not sure if it was referring to the noodle itself or the chef, we decided to try.  First thing you notice is the decorations. They have not done any reno from the last Korean restaurant that we there. So 0 for environment.   I got a lamb noodle. If you are not a fan of that lamb taste, this is not for you. I'm a fan of lamb so I had a field day with the lamb. The flavor is less compare to other and to my liking. The meat is not that tender either. I think this has to go back to the source of ingredients. But oh well.  What kept this review up a bit was the noodle and the quality. The noodle is chewy and tasty and will fill most people up. Also service and speed was not bad."}
{"text":"Some people like hearing and seeing the noodles being made. Others don't. For those that do (like me), this place has you covered. The noodles taste fresh and soup is tasty. Get the tofu skewers if you're looking for a little bit extra - whatever powder they put on it makes it delicious."}
{"text":"The noodles here are so. good and so. fresh. Portions are huge. Prices are great. If I weren't on a low carb diet most of the time I would come here every single day. Their noodle menu is pretty extensive - I love their braised beef noodle soup and pork belly noodle soup. Their broth is on the oily and saltier side so you're likely going to be asking the staff for a lot of water refills."}
{"text":"Kung Fu Noodle at First Markham Place is a decent noodle place if you have craving for some freshly made noodle. I like fresh noodle because of the more chewiness texture and more QQ taste.  Beef with Ribbon Noodle ($7.99) the thickest noodle they offers. Perfect chewiness. Beef was on the dry side.   Service was fast and prompt. A lot of smaller tables so great for lone diner.   I would go back to try some of their BBQ skewers next time. Tofu looks promising!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and enjoyed the hand tossed noodle and the tofu noodle. It's pretty good especially on a cold winter night.   I like how they have different kind of noodles for soup which is great.  Prices are reasonable and portions are pretty good! I would come back :)"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I've tried many mediocre noodle places and I say mediocre because they usually all taste the same to me but this place is so below the mediocrity that it's just plain gross. I got their spicy beef with ribbon noodles (aka the thick flat ones), and while the price was appealing (8.99), the taste was just whatever and the noodles were the kind you'd find in your freezer two years later at the way back because you shopped for too much groceries and forgot about them. They were soggy af and expired white patches all over. Nasty.   Service was great but yeah, since you're a restaurant, food is your main market so for that, I'll probably never come back again."}
{"text":"The noodles we ordered arrived a few minutes after placing our order. The taste was excellent and I would definitely come back again. The restaurant was also really clean."}
