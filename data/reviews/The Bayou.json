{"text":"Great spot, quiet street, nice outdoor seating. There isn't many seats but I liked it better that way. I had the fried shrimp po'boy sand and sweet potato fries...delish! Loved the laid back servers. I did not check out the inside though so can't say much there. I would recommend this spot if you are looking for a cool laid back atmosphere and some good Cajun food. I also had a strawberry margarita that was perfect; not too sweet and made with fresh strawberries."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was not very great. It was a lot more like a bar that also serves food then i expected. Mostly what they offered was cajon style sandwiches. I had the fried crayfish sandwich and I thought it was good, but maybe needed a little more seasoning. The whole meal just felt like it was missing something. I also had the seafood gumbo as a side and I thought this was very good and defiantly the best this about this place. it was a little spicy, but very good and authentic. The service was not that great. the waiter seemed very rushed and acted like he didnt care very much. I probably wont go back, but if you like good gumbo its worth the stop."}
{"text":"Food was reheated from yesterday.  Red beans and rice. We're runny and poor quality sausage.  Bread was dry and old at least two day old bread. Jambalaya chicken was dry and reheated from yesterday at best. Chicken dry. Would never go back"}
{"text":"Very on and off.  They used to be the best place to get cajun food that I've found in Madison, but they're very inconsistent.  They also have some waitresses that are absolutely abysmal.  Sometimes I've gone and they've been really delicious and spicy and everything you could ask.  Other times I've gone and the food is bland, the sweet potato fries are half-cooked, and the service is absolutely awful. 

One visit, we ordered in a nearly empty restaurant and waited for 2 hours without getting food.  The waitress had to be chased down and it took 45 minutes to even get water at our table. 

We gave it a final try about a month ago to see if it had improved and it hadn't.  The sweet potato fries still had hard uncooked fries in them and they had gotten rid of all the spiciness in the breading for the po'boys and the catfish.  While the remoulade does add a little bit of spiciness, the food just wasn't up to what it used to be."}
{"text":"The fact that this place was half empty on a Saturday night should have been a hint, but we thought we'd give it a shot, since I love New Orleans food. After tasting the food I could see why others chose to dine elsewhere. 

The food was incredibly BLAND! When you think of food from New Orleans what should spring to mind is dishes full of flavor and SPICE. This was anything BUT. I ordered the Etouffe with shrimp. The mush that I was given was tasteless and literally made my stomach churn, not to mention only 5 smallish shrimp decorated the plate. The red beans and rice were equally disgusting-- even a healthy amount of Tabasco couldn't boost the flavor of this flavorless dish-- also the Andouille was clearly that of low quality. We also ordered the nachos which I thought were a sloppy mess for $12.99. Definitely not worth it. The cheese could have passed for Velveeta. 

The service was mediocre. We were asked if we would like dessert before our entrees even arrived. I will give them credit for comping $9 off our bill, since it was clear that we barely touched our entrees.

Very, very disappointing. Never going there again and telling everyone I know to steer clear!"}
{"text":"Again a trip to the eatery was A++! Mia was behind the bar again and our server Vic was attentive but not overbearing. If you truly want to have a taste of NOLA.....get down to Butler Street."}
{"text":"So don't be fooled by their \"happy hour\" because it is a huge scam. They only give you the happy hour if your at the bar, even if you start ordering at the bar and then sit at a table in the bar area. In our experience they were extremely rude, when a glass broke-- an accident that often happens at bars and restaurants--they were less than helpful and made our friend feel guilty for the accident. From our experience, customer service was sub-par."}
{"text":"Favorite Happy Hour Spot!

6 oysters & 2 drinks for $12! Yes please!

Oysters are delicious, both fresh and chargrilled. Catfish po'boy is my go-to entrée. A huge catfish filet deep fried to a perfect crispiness. Top it with the remoulade, and order it 'dressed'. Fresh cut fries are always a hit. Lots of fun cocktails to choose from, and when they have their Tabasco infused vodka available, order a Steamboat martini, woohoo! Other favorites include: crab cakes, gravy fries, and seafood artichoke dip. Encounters with the servers and bartenders have always been pleasant. I always leave with a smile on my face."}
{"text":"Great drink list- must try the NOLA cola!  We started at the bar, had great service from the bartender- very friendly and quick to refill our drinks.  Ordered the sweet potato fries as an appetizer, which were interesting, in a good way.  They were served with a remoulade, spicy and tangy- yum!  We ended up eating upstairs, and while we thought the interior was really nicely done, the outdoor patio-style chairs (and umbrella!) were unnecessary additions.  Our server, April, was very good and helped with some recommendations about the menu.  We ended up getting a few dishes for the table and then sharing them, so we tried a little of everything.  The shrimp nachos were the most interesting, with large triangles of homemade tortilla chips.  The catfish po-boy was fine with a good fillet, although po-boys seem to always have way more bun than is necessary.  I'm not a fan of crabcakes, but I was told that they were OK, too.

We'll be back, especially to drink, perhaps for another meal."}
{"text":"For Madison, this place ain't so bad. The chargrilled oysters are very good and the crabcakes were delicious.

My only complaint? The beignets. Those are the most god-awful beignets I've ever had. Nowhere near Cafe du Monde (as the menu claims). Just, no.

Otherwise, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Only moved from Austin 3 weeks ago and feel great to have found The Bayou in such a short time.  We've lived on the Gulf from Orange Beach, AL to Rockport, TX  and must say, it's hard to find better oysters than this little gem on Butler St.  Especially  the char grilled.  Freshly shucked with parmesan, butter and an exceptional sauce that did not overwhelm the east coast oysters.  Better than Drago's in NOLA, which is saying a lot.  All the oysters are hand shucked, to order, including those in the excellent poor boy or any of the other dishes.  And I mean ALL the oysters are hand shucked.  This is unheard of in most places on the Gulf.  They mostly shuck only those being served on the half shell.  With all the rest delivered in plastic tubs.  
   
   Crawfish etouffe was VERY flavorful without the sometimes obligatory 'burn your mouth til it hurts' spices think represent NOLA dishes.
 
  Hats off to the chef & suppliers.  And to  whoever came up with the original & authentic decor. The mural on one wall depict true NOLA musicians (you'll actually recognize some.)  And the other represent actual people from Madison (shown enjoying Mardi Gras.

  Can't wait to return for the bread pudding.

{"text":"Really great, perfect sized portions. Prices are perfect. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Walked in, took a seat to only be walked passed by the servers multiple times. When asked if they served tables was told yes but we better hurry up there was only 10 minutes left to order food. We had not been served a drink or even given a menu to do so even if we wanted. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"Good food at a decent price. We went here for New Years. They had an adult xxx entertainment trivia night. I think some of us were a little uncomfortable with the atmosphere. But the service was 'okay.' And the food was 'decent.'"}
{"text":"The immediate stench of stale beer was a bit worrisome but our overall experience was enjoyable. The indoor atmosphere of outdoor Bourbon Street is like no other! Steamboat was by far the most interesting drink I've tasted; vodka martini, spicy yet light and refreshing. BBQ shrimp appetizer was so flavorful and spicy, we had to take a small container home-thanks to the staff for suggestions on how to use it!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has been here for 7 years and we just discovered it. Great music and drinks. My friend had the grilled oysters and loved them and we shared veggie nachos--pretty good, but i didn't love the cheese in them."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good Cajun food. They're one of the few places that has Abita (Louisiana made beer) on tap; 3 or 4 kinds!
The negatives? One big one is that they serve their beer in hard plastic pints. No thank you, I'll take a grown up glass. But that was the only gripe; but it's a serious offense. The jumbalaya was the second best I had in the state, next to Craw Daddy's in Milwaukee.  Highly recommend, but of course...a little spicy (which is good!)."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently returned from a honeymoon in New Orleans craving the cuisine. At the Bayou, my po-boy was good but the oysters left much to be desired. There was some kind of coagulated cheese mess on the oysters and they were gritty. A major disappointment."}
{"text":"Another Saturday afternoon and here I am at The Bayou again. Happily, the have one of my davorite beers on tap again....Abita's Grapefruit IPA!! This pairs so well with the grilled oysters that I specifically made the trek all the way from 'the land beyond the beltline' for. Unfortunately,  the Grapefruit IPA is a seasonal beer, and it's been on tap for two weeks already, so how much longer they'll have it is anyone's guess. I debated whether to even tell y'all about it, since that means more for me while it's here, but being a good Yelper, there it is. 
All the food I've had here has been excellent but the oysters are always my go to. Whether you get 'em fresh on the half-shell, grilled, or 'dirty' (in a shot of vodka), you will not be disappointed. 
Make sure you get here for Fat Tuesday! The most fun celebration in Madison and they serve AMAZING beignets!! (which are served freshly made year round!)
Do yourself a favor, take a Saturday afternoon and make the trip to New Mad-orleans!"}
{"text":"Wednesday was one of those randomly glorious days in April in Wisconsin, and it seemed that everyone was out to enjoy it.  It was about 6pm, and we were looking for a place to have dinner outside, but basically anything near the capitol/State Street looked packed.  The Bayou had space, we were hungry, so we stopped.  I honestly expected it to be pretty bad, but it surprised me.

First, their outdoor space, while not huge, is nice and on a relatively quiet street, which made a great place to chill and enjoy conversation and have a few drinks.  The server that we had was a bit of an oddball (funny sense of humor), but really nice and attentive.  (Could've been because he only had 2 or 3 tables, but whatever.)

As noted by other reviewers, the sweet potato fries were pretty yummy.  The catfish was good, if a wee salty.  The vegetarian gumbo desperately needed a little more spice, though.  Pretty bland, but not offensive.  The other sides, green beans and salad, were tasty and fresh.  The real kicker, though, was the bread pudding.  I haven't had a lot of bread pudding, so I profess no expertise, but this stuff was damn good!  

The inside of the restaurant was definitely interesting... I didn't spend enough time inside to be either offended or enchanted, but I could see how it could've gone either way, although it seemed more fun than creepy.  

Overall, I'd probably stop again at The Bayou for a few drinks or dinner outside, but it's not one of my top choices."}
{"text":"I dined at the Bayou for lunch on a recent weekday afternoon and really enjoyed it. I followed it up with a visit during Happy Hour a couple of days later. The atmosphere is French Quarter New Orleans. There's a giant statue of a Mardi Gras dancer. There's balconies around the inside reminiscent of the French Quarter. The staff were all friendly and fun and seemed to be enjoying themselves. It feels festive.

They serve a wide variety of beverages from the Abita brewery. I tried a couple of them and thoroughly enjoyed both. I'm not usually much of an IPA drinker, but the Abita IPA was very good. I also enjoyed a raspberry iced-tea. Great raspberry flavor. If you like sweet tea, you'll love this.

The food is creole inspired. We started with a dozen raw oysters. They have an oyster bar behind the regular bar where you can see them at work. The oysters were briny and delicious. Bits of shell did come off while slurping up a couple of them, but I enjoyed it all the same. The battered cheese curds were fine. I can't say I noticed much Cajun flavor, but they are cheese curds so you can't go wrong. Both the cheese curds and the oysters were served with a smattering of fresh mixed greens. For entrees we had the crawfish etouffee and jambalaya. The etouffee was just a little spicy. The roux was great. I really enjoyed this dish. I had ordered the lunch portion but I wish I had gotten the full-size. It was really good. My companion ordered the jambalaya and thought it was a little too spicy, but I thought it was delicious and would order it.

If you are looking for a taste of New Orleans, this is a great place to go."}
{"text":"This would be a five-star joint based purely on the food.

Cajun Cheese Curds? Why yes, I do in fact enjoy bursts of flavor with every bite.

Chicken Sausage Jambalaya? Why yes, I also enjoy generous amounts of tender chicken and spiced sausages laid over a creamy bed of rice casserole immersed in a rich and spicy broth. 

Shrimp po-boy? Pieces of fried goodness laid over a bed of vegetables crammed inside two giant loaves of sandwich buns? Yes please! 

However, I had to deduct one star for their cocktail drinks. Having tried the voodoo juice and a few others, I can honestly say it's just not very good. 

First, everything's a tad too sweet. And by a tad, I mean like so overwhelmingly sweet that you can't taste any alcohol. Hey, don't get me wrong, I don't want my cocktails to taste like 151s, but there's a reason I didn't order a soda. Second, the syrup just tastes very artificial, and leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth.

Anyways, aside from that, the food was absolutely out of this world! 

Though, what's up with the DJ booth and the definitely-not-very-southern music playing in the background? Just curious, as it doesn't really match the theme.

PS: adult trivia on Wednesday nights and even more adult trivia on Tuesday nights."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp taco appetizer and shrimp was a little undercooked.  Crayfish Etoufee was average a few bites of the crayfish tasted weird and kind of ruined my tastebuds.  Restaurant was not to busy but it was 2pm.  Services was good as she was the server bartender and cashier and hostess.  I won't rush to come back"}
{"text":"This place doesn't have just good food, they have the BEST food in Madison, in my opinion.  I have always had friendly service, even if it is not always attentive.  But the food is what keeps me coming back.  This is the first choice for date night for my wife and I.  Get the NOLA BBQ Shrimp with extra bread.  Your mouth with burn but you can't stop eating them.  SOO good!  I always get the gumbo of the day, too, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great sweet potato fries. Just incredible. That itself is reason enough to visit. However, I went for lunch and it was incredibly cold inside. Either they switched off the heat or their heater has problems, it was snowing outside and we were freezing inside. This is also the reason the food becomes cold very fast."}
{"text":"Ok so the food was pretty good, though we only had appetizers. The fries and gravy and bacon were awesome, but only good in small quantities. It was a Monday night and the place got slammed as we walked in and they only had one waitress for about 8 tables. She was great and did extremely well considering. The crawfish and shrimp tacos were a steal at two bucks a piece."}
{"text":"Just returned from my second stop at the Bayou. I thought I reviewed this place before, but maybe not. Excellent experience - service was very well done plus very sincere and a happy disposition. Met family there - we tried three different PoBoys, shrimp, buffalo chicken and Gator! All three were quite good. The chicken actually had the best flavor, but it was a close call. We also tried the Gator gumbo which was light and spicy and very good. Add in Happy Hour prices on some signature beers - and you really have a decent place for dinner. The Brown ale we tried was quite good."}
{"text":"Some of the best Cajun good outside of Louisiana !!! Very friendly staff, oysters were sooooo fresh and the atmosphere makes you feel like you're eating outdoors on bourbon street!!! Overall 10 stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Really fun place - it definitely looks and feels like New Orleans.

The food isn't AS good as legit New Orleans food, but does pretty well for being in Madison, Wisconsin - I particularly like the crab benedict on their brunch menu

Every time I have been here at night, it has been pretty low key, I kind of wish there were more people there, dancing and whatnot, it could be a great time.

mega plus: they serve Abita beer which is delicious. They also have some classic New Orleans cocktails which is fun.

I love the ceiling! at night, there are little lights that twinkle like the sky!"}
{"text":"This place is often empty, and a good getaway for a group of six or more, cause you can always find tables. It has a French quarter New Orleans kitche feel, with Mardi Gras overkill vibe. You can get oysters, creole, poboys and Jambalaya...but I always walk away thinking 'I could have made this at home.\" Average beer selection. Solid three stars."}
{"text":"We showed up on Friday night at 7pm and there was no wait for a table. Sweet. What's not so sweet is the good news ends there. 

We ordered some waters, a cocktail and the Cajun Cheese curds. We didn't get our waters and cocktail until we were half way done with the curds. Not OK. Those things are salty man! My Pimms cup was served in a hard plastic that reminded me of middle school lunches. Classy.

Our entrees  were OK my girlfriend had the fish tacos. They were pretty spicy but nothing too special. I had the catfish po boy with a side of sweet potato fries which were extra $. There were 7 fries. 7. I thought it was kinda ridiculous but the catfish po boy was huge. I didn't know how to eat it. I tried to smush it down but it was still too big to get my mouth around it. The bun was hard and maybe a little stale so that didn't make it any easier...

Service was painfully slow. Food was average. There are too many other better places to warrant a second visit."}
{"text":"Even though my experience at the Bayou was extremely marginal, I did actually think the decor was entertaining and interesting, at least.  Sure, it's tacky and weird, but every now and then it's nice to go to a bar that looks a little different than every other bar in Madison.  

That being said, I would recommend going for three very specific reasons: 1) outdoor seating- it's hard to find sometimes in this neighborhood, but generally guaranteed here, 2) the Cajun cheese curds- unlike any other I've ever had, gooey and a little spicy and a huge portion, 3) sweet potato fries- again, a generous portion and delicious.  Don't be in a hurry, though, or easily offended because the bartenders are slow, inconsiderate, and seemingly very inexperienced."}
{"text":"The decor is very unique.  It is like an indoor courtyard which is very distinctive and fun.  The country music was far too loud and it was definitely distracting.
The po boy sandwich was great, but very difficult to eat.  Overall it was good and I will be back, they just need to tweak a little."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I just had an amazing meal at The Bayou. We started with oysters, both raw and chargrilled, and both were wonderful. 
I ordered the Blackened Crawfish Caeser Salad, recommended by our awesome waitress Miya, after telling her that I was going as low carb as possible. It was delicious!
My husband ordered the Crawfish Etouffee, which my daughter and I also tried, and was also delicious.
My daughter ordered the Bayou Gravy Fries from the appetizer menu for her meal. My husband and I both tried a taste of the gravy, and oh my God.... Sooo yummy. If you've never had bacon in your gravy, you must experience this.
We ordered some beignets to share for dessert, which were served piping hot and accompanied by chocolate drizzle. Perfection! 

We left with smiles on our faces and powdered sugar on our shirts. 
Overall, we would say the food compares to authentic New Orlean's fare, and felt like we were back in the Big Easy for awhile. Then we stepped back out into Wisconsin's winter at 5 degrees, and snapped back to reality."}
{"text":"Highs and lows. I wanted to really like this place. It's quirky, it's unique, but it's hit and miss. I got the jambalaya. If you've ever made Zataran's at home then you've had the Bayou's jambalaya. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't restaurant quality.

My wife got the catfish po boy with sweet potato fries and I would consider these a success. The fries are thick cut and homemade with a slight beading on them. Very good. The piece of catfish wad large, Nicky beaded, and with all the fixin's it was quite tasty.

The oysters were ok, but lacked any of that brine or seasalt flavor that I expect.

The brand of beers they had on tap was also disappointing. Being in Wisconsin we know our beers and these were mediocre at best.

Overall I would go back, but I'd probably stick to the po boys, sweet potato fries, and skip the rest."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food. First impression is s little bar but the menu delivers oysters good. Jambalaya tasty. Beignets are a little tough but if you eat them while they're hot you feel like you're there. They don't reheat or work next dsy"}
{"text":"The decor at this place really bothered me.  I don't know if this is a regular thing or not, but the lights would dim every 5 minutes or so and we'd end up dining in the dark as the lights slowly came back on.  I think it was a consistent thing as the waitresses seemed prepared with flashlights.  Personally, I'd prefer to see my food.  

I've been here twice.  The first time with a group of 6 other people and we all ordered drinks and shared our dishes.  We had oysters that time which we greatly enjoyed.  I had a mint julep which was delicious and I don't know of many places in Madison that even serve mint juleps.  The second time was just me and a friend and I ordered the fried catfish while my friend had the Jambalaya.  My catfish was good, nicely battered, well fried so that it was crispy on the outside and really juicy tender fish on the inside.  I thought it was a bit pricey for one piece of catfish though.  It came with sweet potato fries which were also very good.  My friend's Jambalaya came out barely lukewarm.  The temperature reminded me of sticking something from the fridge in the microwave just long enough for it to start to warm up but it's nowhere close to serving temperature.  A mention to the server and she was quick to reheat it.  

The service was fine.  The waitress was nice but seemed still new as she wasn't sure how the menu worked, what sides came with with what dish, etc.  She had to come and go a couple of times to tell us the specials and find out the answers to our questions.  They had a special on some seasonal beers too that they were trying to move out which were only a buck or two."}
{"text":"While my experience was not as appalling as the previous reviewer's, I, too, can hardly recommend a meal at The Bayou.  But I did (after some thought) choose to give it two stars, rather than one, so let me explain why:

The food wasn't terrible.  It was bland and uncreative.  I ordered the red beans and rice with andouille sausage.  The hearty portion of it that I was served was pretty good, but under-salted and perhaps under-seasoned, in general.  The highlight of the meal might have been our appetizer of Bourbon Hot Wings, which were nice and meaty with a good, spicy sauce coating them.

What was really more atrocious than the food at The Bayou was the decor and the service.  Michael R. noted that the murals on the inside walls of the restaurant are tacky and touristy.  I'll give him that, but my bigger complaint was the furniture.  The restaurant is entirely indoors, and yet the only table/chair options are metal \"grate\" patio furniture!  Great for an evening outdoors (and necessary, I understand, if you need weather resistant pieces), but uncomfortable and unnecessary indoors. 

And the service was slow.  It took our server a long time to seat us, and to bring us our drinks.  The appetizer was slow coming out, as was the main course.  The time in between service and the obligatory check-in (\"how is everything?\") was long, as well, which was unfortunate because it meant that we didn't even get salt on our table until we were halfway through our main course.  The slow service also meant that when I was unsatisfied with my drink (I ordered an Old Fashioned.  What they served me was a watery glass of whiskey with seemingly no other flavoring), it took a while to exchange it (for the Nola Cola, which was actually quite good).

Two stars or one, the bottom line on The Bayou is probably still: don't bother."}
{"text":"Good deals on drinks especially happy hour.  From the quality of bread, sandwiches and po boys will be a better selection than New Orleans Favorites.  To try, Bayou Gravy Fries (aka poutine), and Cajun Cheese Curds (can you go wrong with a Wisconsin favorite?).

Duck Gumbo -- original.  Not bad.  Undercooked rice.  Overwhelming chili spice.

Red Beans and Rice -- the Monday freebie portion is a cup.  Not bad.  Same undercooked rice.

Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya -- stay away.  Plenty of dry chunky chicken.  Only 6 slices of perfectly pan seared andouille sausage.  Not much taste to it.  Soggy rice and plenty of it.

Bayou Beignets -- it's a joke...whomever said that it's better than Cafe Du Monde.  Dough is too thick.  Right on the powder sugar portion.  The chocolate syrup makes the beignets soggy.  A waste of $$.

Community Coffee (New Orleans Blend) -- the roasters totally forgot the chicory (that makes Cafe Du Monde latte special).

Venue and Service -- clean.  The balcony is the place to be.  Service is pleasant, nice and thoughtful.

What I had is not great, and already expected...however, go for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Went with my husband last week when the weather was nice; we sat outside, so I really haven't seen the interior decor, but I plan to go back in the near future to remedy that.

I have to wonder if they've made a concerted effort to respond to people's claims that the service is surly, because they were EXTREMELY friendly to us--something that I sometimes find annoying, but our server was very personable, so it didn't ring false.

The sweet potato fries were delicious as promised--there are a lot of side items available with the sandwiches, but I'd be afraid nothing else would live up to those fries.  I had the turkey po' boy and was disappointed in the cheddar (seriously, does ANY cheddar on a melt actually taste like anything in this town?), but the turkey was seasoned well enough that it was still a good sandwich.  The french bread they use for the po' boys was also VERY nice, although the \"dressed\" version (tomatoes, pickles, lettuce) was SO stuffed that it was impossible to eat it without doing some serious deconstruction first.  My husband had the shrimp etouffe and said it was delicious.

They also had $2 glasses of wine for happy hour; I had a glass of the sauvignon blanc and was quite pleased.  It wasn't AMAZING, but it was more than worth $2.  I also had a gin fizz, a drink I have always wanted to try, and enjoyed it very much, although the menu gives rather incomplete information about the ingredients--our server did make sure I wasn't allergic to eggs before making it, but I didn't realize it also had butter in it until I asked.  My husband ordered one with lime juice instead of lemon after our server mentioned the possibility, and thought it was just as good--I prefer the classic with lemon juice, but that's just a matter of personal taste.  An excellent dessert drink, and I look forward to trying more of their specialty cocktails in the future.

Honestly, I wish I'd had a muffaletta instead of the turkey po' boy--it just seems more like one of their staple menu items, given the whole theme of the place.  I'll have to try it next time we're there."}
{"text":"The Bayou knocked my socks off! This place is so chock-full of culture that I almost gave it 5 stars, but the food wasn't quite at that level. I had 3 of their amazing char grilled oysters (kinda weird that they were cheesy, but it worked and even made me and my friends feel the need to lick the shells clean, oops), the shrimp étouffée (I got the lunch version which was the perfect size, had a great texture and was a perfect heat level for those not willing to go too spicy), and two desserts. The beignets were sinfully awesome, but the dough was thick and tasted a little too yeasty. The sweet potato bread pudding was too masked by the chocolate and caramel sauces it soaked in; we won't order that again. My friends loved their dishes... I tried a bite of the catfish po boy and it was pretty great. The service was EXCELLENT- everyone working there seemed happy to be there. Customers at the bar seemed to be treated like family. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at The Bayou on Thursday the 23rd at 5:00 and it was my first time eating here.  We started with drinks...the bartender (Vic?) made me a spicy vodka martini and my lady had a fruity rum drink.  Food-wise I started with the crawfish tacos and char-grilled oysters....my girlfriend had potato soup (LOL).  Everything was what I expected and tasted great.  For dinner I went with the po'boy sausage and peppers....Marcia had a crabcake sandwich....some of which I got to finish. :)  I loved the food...Marcia said it was too spicy for her tho so if I eat here again i'll do carry-out."}
{"text":"Oh, Bayou, how you toy with my heart. I lived in the south for a few years and this is the best place I've come across that mimics the southern taste. New Orlean's Take Out has nothing on the flavor of The Bayou. I would be more than happy to give a five star and become a regular if the prices were lowered. Alas, this place remains over priced. My first experience here was amazing. My friends and I talked with the person who was working at the time (we were the only ones in the place) and he was incredibly friendly! He tried to convince us to come to adult trivia, which I would love to go to. The prices really just keep me away. I live super close by to this place so usually when I get food here it's a pickup. My boyfriend is usually the one who places the calls, but he's complained to me multiple times about some lady being rude.

As far as the beignets go, I have no idea if they're like Cafe du Monde. I never managed to make it to New Orleans which is something I regret and plan to fix in the very near future. After I have Cafe do Monde's I'll try to remember to update this review. That being said, I do like The Bayou's, but I don't know if they're the best thing ever.

I love the look of the place! It's over the top, but in a way that fits New Olreans. I wish they would change the tables and seats. I understand it works perfect for the theme, I just don't like it for an indoor restaurant.

Oh, I almost forgot! I really love their seasonal beers! I forget which I tried but it was delicious and the person working really helped me to figure out which I should get.

Edit: I'm going to have to bump this up to a five star for a fantastic staff."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was neat, twinkly star ceiling, decor, ect., but could've upgraded the metal patio table and chairs for real dining furniture. 

My husband and I both ordered Po Boys (shrimp and crawfish), neither were exceptionally exciting or left us wanting more. Sweetpotato fries were worth 4-stars. Prices were a high for the overall feel of the place and food."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went here for restaurant week and it was fabulous!!!  Loved the atmosphere, it feels just like being in NOLA.  The food had a great cajun spicy kick and was served perfectly!!!  I had the cajun cheese curds which were amazing, I'm going to say the best in Madison!!! They have Purple Haze on tap which is one of my favorite beers!!! I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Went to the Bayou on a Saturday night. It was a great volume level. it wasn't too busy but at the same time it wasn't empty. they had good drink specials and a very friendly server. 

The decor was really well done. the ever changing mood lighting is a really nice touch; however, not all of the looks are great. it's a great place to sit, have a few drinks, and enjoy everything around you."}
{"text":"Went there for my husband's and my 7th year wedding anniversary just on a whim. I found it here on Yelp and took a gamble. I'm so glad I did, it was a fabulous experience! Who ever wrote any negative comments must have a stick up their butt or live on nasty McDonalds and have a bland pallet. I got a Creole dish and a Lady bug drink, my husband got some jambalaya and a jack and coke and our bill was only 31 bucks! Great food and drinks for a good price. We got our food out really fast too! The Lady Bug drink was really yummy, kind of reminded me of a jolly rancher but way better. The manager/bartender Miya was really nice and down to earth. We could have sat and talked to her for hours but it started to get busy. It was definitely worth driving to Madison to eat there, which is a 40 minute drive for us. My husband has history working in the food industry and he was also impressed. The food had that wonderful bite of spice but it was not over whelming so you can actually taste the food. The inside of the building is just cool. I think every time you go you could spot something new. I also noticed they have a really huge projector tv that they were showing the Badger football game. 
If my husband and I were more local I could picture us being locals to the bar. But I think we will still make day trips for lunch or dinner as a family due to the reasonable meal prices."}

Decor
Fun! The Bayou has done a lovely job of recreating a French Quarter courtyard, complete with authentic shuttered doors in the appropriate shade of green, lots of plants (fake, but still pretty), iron-work balconies, a pebbled floor, and metal outdoor tables & chairs. I could have done without the 8-foot high jester statue and the painting of the woman about to take her shirt off, but overall the ambiance was authentic New Orleans courtyard.

Service
We were greeted and seated promptly. Our main waitress was friendly, helpful, and efficient. Her replacement while she was on a break was short, unhelpful, and MIA for 10 minutes when we were ready to order dessert. I guess it depends on who you get.

Food
Delicious and authentic. I had the jambalaya, and was a little disappointed to get the (uncommon in NOLA but still authentic) tomato-based kind. However, it was well done with just enough spice and plenty of seasoning, plus ample identifiable vegetables and a fabulous smoky sausage. My husband had the crawfish etoufee, which was creamy and rich, again with plenty of seasoning and reasonable heat.

I have to take issue with other reviewers who say the food was bland because it wasn't spicy enough. Authentic New Orleans food, like food in most places, is spiced to the tastes of the eaters. Many, many dishes are made with only a hint of pepper or even no pepper. Kids eat in New Orleans too! What makes food authentic to New Orleans is the flavor combination of onions, bell peppers, and celery, plus any number of herbs and/or meats. It's always FLAVORFUL, not always spicy. The two dishes we tried had flavor to burn. I don't mind at all that they didn't burn my tongue.

My only real issue with the food was dessert. We ordered bread pudding and a mini pecan pie. The pecan pie was mini indeed, maybe four bites, contained two pecans, and tasted stale. The bread pudding was an odd concoction of bread, sweet potato, and chocolate. It was yummy, but in New Orleans you'd find that in an avant garde bistro that's trying to be different - so, not what you're looking for if you miss New Orleans food. Both desserts had clearly been microwaved (tell-tale hot spots).

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place! Went for the first time last night.  Took my parents and sister here for dinner.  

Place was pretty empty when we went...but we were there for an early dinner on Thursday and the weather was pretty bad out, I can definitely see it getting pretty crowded there normally.  

Loved how the place was decorated, made it look like you were outside on Bourbon Street.  Waiter was super nice. Made us feel really welcome.

Food and drinks were great all around.  Everything we ordered: gator bites, crawfish platter, fried shrimp po boy, jumbalaya, and red beans and rice.  Also, we unknowingly went when it was happy hour, so that was a pleasant surprise when we got the check....two dollar glasses of wine!! 

Definitely going back.  

Random Note: From the sign on the door, they're not taking credit cards anymore starting November 1."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a party of four.  Ambiance was pretty fun, but the food was very poor.  We were expecting flavorful, authentic New Orleans style cuisine, but instead got bland mush.  And halfway through our meal the lights went out for 3 or 4 minutes.  Our server was not concerned because apparently, it happens all the time.  Definetely will not go back."}
{"text":"A must on every trip back to Wisconsin.  The voodoo juice specials are always yummy, but the appetizers are killer.

Cajun Cheese Curds, Sweet Potato Fries are a staple.  But all the food is really good and the staff is friendly.  It's a great place to go hang out with old friends.  

I only wish they were in Las Vegas too for when I have a hankering for fried cheese curds."}
{"text":"It was a rainy and disgusting night in Madison, but we'd trekked over for a concert and were starving. I called to make reservations and they kind of laughed. When we got to Madison we tried all the restaurants near the venue, and all were booked solid, so we wandered over to The Bayou. It's crazy how just a couple blocks away, this place was dead. 

The interior is cool - very NOLA themed of course. We ordered two Hurricanes, and then cut off those. They are so overwhelmingly sweet that we worried we'd get gut rot before getting a buzz. We moved onto beer/cocktails after that. 

Joe ordered the Etouffee, I ordered the chicken and sausage jambalaya. They were both very spicy. His stew was almost a little grainy? Hard to describe the texture. All I could taste was spice in mine, but it was good - I like it spicy!

This meal was good, and it's a cute place, just not sure we'd go out of our way to return."}
{"text":"OMG!!! This is the best place ever and I do mean ever. 
I have been in 3 time zones in the last three weeks from D.C. to Cali, and guess where I found the most inviting southern atmosphere, Madison, WI. Go Figure?
Upon entering we were greeted with smiling faces and catered to as if we were the only patrons. 
It looked and felt as if we were actually in the French Quarters.
OK, O.k. ,  the food, the food all I have to say is if you ever been to Nawlins you would know that this is not an imitation this Kat is the real deal. 
The other reviews must have gone on an off day, the food was yummy the service was delightful and the atmosphere inviting. 
Thank you Travis for bringing a little home to Madtown, OH, did I mention my familia  relocated from the 7th ward after the storm?
I totally forgot our servers name however, Chi-town you were awesome."}
{"text":"Best Cajun in Madison. Authenic right down to the red beans!"}
{"text":"Delightful interior with Mardi Gras/Bourbon Street murals and a giant jester statue inside.  Bar area merges into the restaurant area.  Upstairs seating overlooks downstairs like a outdoor balcony looking down on a street cafe.  Mojitos, chicken and sausage Jambalaya, and sweet potato fries are good, as are the po'boys.  The food is not that spicy; more on the bland side when one thinks of Cajun."}
{"text":"Recently went to the Bayou with a group of 20.  Quick service and good food.  

I honestly think this is one of Madison hidden places!"}
{"text":"While a lot of the previous reviews are negative, I for one didn't have such an appalling experience.  My friends and I stopped here after dinner one night and did so out of the blue because we were curious to see what it was like.

The decor was amazing, I love how you feel like you are outside in a New Orleans street at night, as it got darker the little lights in the ceiling painted like a sky-scape began to twinkle.  The murals themselves are beautiful and whoever did them has a a wonderful talent.  New Orleans is eccentric and full of a rich cultural history and the murals, decorations and art are representative of that.

I think it's clever that everyone relates back to being outside in a New Orleans street, including the tables and chairs which are what you would find on an outdoor patio.  We started with four of their drink specialties including the Purple Haze, The Hurricane and Flirtin for a Hurtin.  All were tasty and made quite quickly.

While we were waiting, we decided to take their monster beer bong that resembles an octopus with eight legs.  It was hilarious and fun and gave us a chance to sample the incredible selection of Abita beer on tap.

We threw a couple bucks at the jukebox and played the music we wanted to hear and enjoyed the cocktails and atmosphere for about an hour.  Halfway through we decided to be adventurous and try some fresh oysters and the bartender happily shucked four fresh ones for us.  (He offered to serve them \"dirty\" for us, which means dropping it into a shot of vodka.) We decided to hold off on that experience for next time.

I thought the bartenders were helpful and nice and very accommodating.  We had a great time and I'm sure we'll try it again soon."}
{"text":"They worked on this place forever!  Lived in the building next door and walked past it everyday for a long time watching it \"in progress\"

After a lot of drama (neighborhood lady didn't want it there due to it being near residential spaces and a daycare) and financing issues, etc.  I don't think the final product is amazing.  It's just another place to bar hop to!

A fun place nonetheless for the thematic element.  You are supposed to feel like you are on Bourbon St in New Orleans.  There are characters painted on the walls meant to seem to be standing on wrought-iron balconies.  The feeling of being outside, inside.  Confusing? Haha.

Just go, you'll be amused and get a beer bong with 6 spigots!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place in Madison. Anyone who knows me knows that I love a good Cajun/creole restaurant! I had super high hopes based on the restaurant name and amazing decor.

We came in on a Saturday for lunch at 1 and the place was empty, literally 3 other people at the bar. I ordered the crawfish etoufee (see photo), it was decent but not as good as I expected. My fiancé had the chicken and sausage jambalaya, but he said it was just ok. 

I definitely plan on returning maybe for dinner on a Friday/Saturday night, I imagine it's a totally different scene. I do recommend this place for anyone looking to try something outside of cheese curds and burgers."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Cajun restaurant in Madison. My favorite thing here is the Crawfish Etouffee. It's quite spicy.
It was prepared differently than what I've had in New Orleans. But I think it tastes better the Bayou way.
The ambiance is very similar to the French Quarter outside restaurants."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Bayou during restaurant week, and several times during trivia, and every time I swear I will never do it again.  lol  Disappointing is really the word I would use to describe the food. If you order anything other than Cajun food, it will be blah, and if you order Cajun food, it will be just ok.  Don't order a burger or the Caesar salad.  The best things on the menu are the cheese curds (weird, I know) and the beignets.  Service during Tuesday trivia is hit and miss (with more misses than hits).  I wish they would really try to wow on both accounts, but as it is, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Cheap happy hour spot ($2 glasses of wine and cheap beer), plenty of seating (the place was empty, so accommodating a large group was no problem). Appetizers ordered were ok...cheese curds and sweet potato fries were good, but the \"nachos\" and artichoke dip were served with fried wontons rather than tortilla chips. Strange, and the menu doesn't mention this. Our group didn't order any entrees, so I can't comment on those.

Staff was very friendly and attentive. New Orleans style decor needs to be updated, everything looks a little dated and cheesy."}
{"text":"Very friendly server  Very good food with the perfect spice level.  Good absinthe cocktail :)"}
{"text":"loved it, great food and our server was friendly and helpful.  great looking place and worth the two hours I drove to get there!"}
{"text":"Stopped by work day lunch and was NOT disappointed! Crab cakes with a house salad and andouille vinaigrette as recommended by wait staff. Very tasty. Will be returning for blackened crawfish and lobster recommendations. Perfect little local establishment off the beaten path. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Cajun food I've ever had.  Service is wonderful and the live music is great!!!!  I love coming here on Thursday evenings."}
{"text":"I tried the Chicken and Sausage Jambalaya and it was decent.  I've had better, but then I've had worse.  The heat was good, but I wanted a little more flavor.  I added some Tabasco (they have several different kinds of hot sauce which is nice) and that added more flavor.  The food was also prepared well.

I had no problems with the wait staff and service was prompt.

I really liked the music they had playing while I was there.  It reminded me of my college days and being in a bar (though I wasn't drinking which was much different than when I was in college) seemed appropriate with the music."}
