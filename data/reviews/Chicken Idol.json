{"text":"Wow!  They don't mess around- everything is made fresh and in-house and there is a lot of LOVE put into the preparation and cooking of the meat. The shwarma I had was so juicy and tender and full of flavour. The baklava was also excellent, moist yet flaky. It's a family-run business and you can tell in the warm, fun, inviting atmosphere. This was formally the location of the Burger Palace and they have really brightened the place up. It's open late so this is a perfect place to grab a bite after the bars and dancing. I live in the building so this is now my go-to lunch spot. Support this independent business that actually cares about and takes pride in the quality of the cuisine! This is REAL middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab food to go. Nicest man at the counter who put together a great falafel dish for me! All fresh, amazing customer service and great price! Recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch with my brother at Chicken Idol. I work right beside it and I have been meaning to try it ever since it replaced the old food joint here. It is relatively new and the opportunity finally arose. I have added an updated picture of the menu to help anyone who might want to check it out. 

I can now say the Chicken Shwarma here is really good. Lots of flavour and great sauces. Definitely get everything on it! It was a bit messy to eat, but messy is always good. The two chicken shwarma sandwiches for $9.99 is a great deal for 2 people who want to grab a quick bite or even one really hungry person. The one was filling enough for me, but I also wasn't extremely hungry. My brother also got a Kebob Sandwich because he was really hungry.

I went just before 1pm and there were a few other people ordering food so it was a bit of a wait. There was only one person behind the counter and he was very friendly and polite. One of the earlier reviews said they wished they would warm up the sandwich on the grill and I can confirm that they do, or at least do now.  

I wanted to give 5 stars, but there was a problem with overcharging for our food. First we were charged for 4 sandwiches at $5.99 each which came to $27. Then we were given back a difference of $7. This was still not right after I looked at the receipt again because we were now being charged three sandwiches at $5.99 instead of $9.99 for the two shwarma sandwiches and $5.99 for the one kebob sandwich. Everything was sorted out in the end, but also a reminder to always check your receipts because it can happen. 

Based on it's location, taste and chicken shwarma deal, I have told all my co-workers to check it out and I will be back again."}
{"text":"Reviews are true, the friendliest man owns this joint and actually takes the time to get to know his customers and their names. He is super lovely and enough reason to give the food a shot. My boyfriend gets a burger from here at least once a week and they are consistently delicious and the fries are crispy and yummy!! Will definitely be back, the proximity to my building is too good to pass up :)"}
{"text":"Tell ur Con Scum face brother Khaled \" Akram \" to return the $7000 he stole from me.. bunch of idiots who owns a garbage food business."}
{"text":"First meal in Toronto and was great to be greeted by such a friendly owner. The two shwormas for 10 dollars is ridiculous value!"}
{"text":"One of my fave places to grab a falafel wrap in the city! I started going here because it was close to my place, but the hospitality and kindness of the owner keeps me coming back. The wrap is grilled perfectly and the french fries are the BEST. Ask for them a little extra crispy you won't be disappointed! Plus the falafel wrap and fries are under $10, can't be beat."}
{"text":"I had takeout from here the other day (I work down the street) and really enjoyed it. I had a chicken shawarma sandwich and I swear the chicken in it was soooooo tasty. I've had chicken shawarma lots of times from lots of places but this place I can't get the chicken out of my mind it was so tasty. I pretty much got everything on it and whatever sauces they use definitely just go with it. The only thing I wished they did was warm up the sandwich on the grill but otherwise very tasty. I also got baclava and that was good too."}
{"text":"Grill & Go Chicken Idol is at it again. They are evolving to meet the needs and tastes of the neighbourhood. First of all they have a new name!You can't go wrong with their traditional middle eastern / shawarma cuisine. It is SO good. Since then they have added pizza, fried chicken, burgers and now onion rings. However the latest and greatest addition just this week is a fresh fruit juice/smoothie bar and oh my are they delicious. Please tell the owner Rae you saw this review on Yelp and I'm confident you'll be posting your own just like this."}
