{"text":"The staff in there are rude. Refuse to pay performers as agreed (they hire a dance crew) and the staff (older men) harass young dancers. This place has 2.6 stars on Maps, just as bad a rating as it here. Avoid and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. I went as a group of 14 ladies for brunch and every single one of us had a disgusting experience. 

-we found numerous black hairs in our food (over 6 hairs were found)
-the plates were dirty as if they weren't washed
-majority of the food was cold
-fish had the consistency of jello as it wasn't cooked
-found gritty stones in the meat dishes
-a lot of the food was stale 

Aside from all of that, they charged us a mandatory 15% gratuity.. Not sure why anyone would expect a tip when they provide the worst possible service. 

I wouldn't go back to this place if someone paid me, worst $33 I've ever spent."}
{"text":"We were four couples and spent our Valentines night there. Over priced for what you get. Mazza was minimal and tasted terrible and only matched by terrible service and attitude from the owner/manager or whatever he thinks he is. They didn't have enough staff and service, even though they sold tickets to the event. All they cared about was over charging. No concept of customer service. Really, $5.99 for a bottle of Nestle water. Live and learn and never again."}
{"text":"I am really torn trying to rank this place. 5 stars for food! The food here is amazing! The hummus is housemade and the pita is cooked fresh just before it comes to the table. Huge pot of mint tea, fattoush, shwarma and kofta. OMG!!  EASILY MY ALL-TIME MOST FAVORITE RESTAURANT IN ALL OF CANADA!!!

Ok....so why only 2 stars if this place is heaven on earth?  They're rarely open.  They seem to have gotten out of the restaurant business and into private parties with music so loud that the bass line can be felt in the sports bar next door.  They might be open for lunch during the week and they may have a buffet at lunch, but they don't open until noon. If you can catch them when they're open to the public, they're SO worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here for the dinner buffet on a Monday there was not too many people and the buffet looked really good however most of the food was just not that great although there were a lot of items very few meat selections they had roast lamb however it was not very tender the majority of the buffet was lacking in my opinion there were exceptions the dips were all fantastic with the fresh pita bread and the dessert bughasta (custard wrapped in filo) was amazing however I lowered their rating significantly due to their service it was simply horrible I'll admit I just got into town (here for work) and was tired this place was not too far from my hotel (4 points by Sheraton) and I came here in comfortable clothes t shirt and jeans nor did i do my hair (as i just had a shower and was gonna go straight to the hotel and sleep after dinner) I do understand I possibly did not make the best first impression that being said they gave very little attention to me the waitress asked every table except mine if they needed something after me waiving her down she would roll her eyes when I asked for more bread when I asked for another drink(which took me 30 min) to get the waitresses attention after she brought it I said thank you and she just walked away when I tried to pay the bill I gave her my debit card after she swiped it before passing the terminal to me she looked at me an asked \"would you like to tip or...) I replied yes and still tipped over fifteen percent not because she deserved it but because i did not want to lower my tipping standards because of one person"}
{"text":"After going to that crap hole cyan we came here and Sam Hana totally took care of us and the ambiance the food we loved it totally worth the drive"}
