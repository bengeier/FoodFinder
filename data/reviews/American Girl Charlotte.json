{"text":"Today was my first visit to the store and it was out of control. Big and little kids were running everywhere. It was so overwhelming but my little cousin was as happy as a bug in a rug. I've never seen her smile so much. She's now the proud owner of Addy and Kaya. I am still wrestling with all of the hype around the American Girl Dolls while I think it's more important to teach my little cousin the history around the time period in which the dolls represent. She is geeked about buying new outfits and other accessories but just as anxious to read the accompanying books that come with each doll."}
{"text":"I came to American Girl in southpark to experience a day of special treatment for my young nieces birthday and her dolls... and we received nothing short of that!  The day started off with a hairstyle and nail painting in the salon, followed by an ear piercing (which we were told the doll was so brave and didn't even cry, lol!) Utterly captivating her imagination and awe!  We then had a reservation at the bistro where Audrey was our server. To say that service was divine would be an understatement!  Audrey made sure each doll had their own teacup, birthday crown, seat at the table etc.  It was a last minute lunch, so audrey did an AMAZING job at throwing a cupcake/birthday cake together for the cherry on top!!  It was an amazing day and the staff at American Girl were impeccable, personal and generally happy people. I'm so grateful for our experience there. I'd highly reccomend it to anyone! (High prices, but we all knew that!)"}
{"text":"Extremely crowded & it was 2-3 hour waits for a hair salon appointment, but was 4 days after Christmas. I live in L.A., & their bistro is huge compared to this. It's very small & I tried to make an appointment for a month! Never got one! Expensive, of course. But the little girls love it!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. They have great options of girl's toys and clothes. The dolls are pricey but I believe they are worth it. The accessories are to die for and I love that they have the same outfit for dolls and girls! They should improve their service. Every time I go there I feel lost. There are so many options but no one ever approaches me for help while I wonder around aimlessly. However, the cashier was very nice."}
{"text":"Great store if you don't mind paying more for doll clothes than you would for your own clothes.  Seriously though, it is a very nice store. Has a bistro with some surprisingly good food.  Dolls cost about $120 each and clothing for your doll will run $20-80. Furniture can be as high as $500"}
{"text":"What my fascination is with American Girl Dolls I cannot explain.  I have wanted one for a while,  but prior to having my baby girl,  I really couldn't justify spending over $100 for a doll that doesn't really DO anything.    The American Doll store allows your little one to explore all possibilities of creative play.  From bedrooms to recording studios,  your little girl can create an entire life style for her doll at this store..   American Dolls came out in 1986. Many of the dolls are sold with a book portraying a back story of the doll.  At first,  the stories focused on various periods of American history, such as the Gold Rush and Civil Rights, but we're then  expanded in 1995 to include more characters.  If your little (or you) cannot identify with a character the company has created there the option to purchase dolls from the line Truly Me. The options for the line of Truly Me dolls range from eye color, eye shape, skin color, hair texture, and hair length. A variety of related clothing and accessories is also available."}
{"text":"Ate at the Bistro. Brought my daughter for an intimate \"Birthday\" dinner. With tax & tip it was $130 for 4 people for food that cost $20 and service that was more than lacking. My daughter spit out the cake because it was obviously a frozen-defrosted cake.  The Salon was only staffed by one person and by the time we got home the 'hair' on my daughter's doll was literally ruined. They re-use the same brush from doll-to-doll transferring the sludge from one to the other. Poor service for the price ($20).  Overall my daughter had a good experience and was happy. That is what matters but as a parent it ain't all that."}
{"text":"My family and I took a trip to this store over the weekend and really enjoyed ourselves. When entering the store the workers greater us with a smile and asked if we needed assistance. Initially I just wanted my daughters to walk around and take a look at the dolls they possible want to purchase without the hassle of a sales person. One worker continued to ask my daughters if they wanted certain dolls until I put an end to her conversation. After that our visit was awesome, the girls selected a doll, of there choice, and we ate at the Bistro. The Bistro had great food and good service!! Our trip was well worth the visit. Our next visit to Charlotte will consist of the girls eating lunch with there dolls again at the Bistro...overall a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"My family visited the store last weekend as an early birthday present for my daughter who will be seven in two weeks. We got there early and she was immediately in awe. She looked in all the windows at the beautiful displays waiting for the doors to open. Once inside she was blown away, running from display to display taking it all in. It was adorable.   We asked to see a personal shopper which is a service that you should book in advance. Since we didn't have much advance notice prior to going I wasn't able to schedule an appointment, but she did have some time free so she took us on a tour of the store telling us about the dolls. Jojo was very sweet and attentive. We selected our doll and some other items and made our purchase then had lunch in the bistro.   Even with a few days notice I was still able to get a table at the bistro. I would strongly suggest getting reservations in advance. The bistro is very small and it was full the entire time we were there. The server was very nice. The food came quickly, but for the price we paid I would've expected a little more. There are no drink refills and the portions were small. The food was average. Something like what you'd get at a Ruby Tuesday, but more expensive. That's really my only complaint. The redeeming factor about the meal was the service and the perks. They serve the dolls \"tea\" in little souvenir cups and saucers and the napkin rings double as hair ties all of which you can take home. The server also gave my daughter a little can of spray chalk as a personal birthday gift just from her.   We then moved on and had an appointment at the salon. If you plan on doing this I would suggest making the appointment as you arrive since there can be a wait. The stylist was also very nice and friendly. Some of the treatments and basic hairstyles could be replicated at home so it might be worth spending a little extra to have a hairstyle done that perhaps you couldn't do yourself. We opted for a basic spa service. This includes a cute little spa robe and accessories that you can take home. Overall I was very pleased with my experience and my daughter was over the moon. We will plan to go again in the future."}
