{"text":"My husband and I wanted a very work-heavy cake for our wedding, and Lesley's not only delivered for us, but made it better! We wanted a tiered cake with frosting that made it look like our main flower, a peony. Upon meeting with the team at their store, we added that we wanted to have ladybugs somewhere on the cake, and needed Precious Moments figurines safely placed on the top. When they pulled our cake out at our reception, I was blown away. Not only did they have unique cake flavors for us to choose that were delicious, they had made the EXACT cake we had dreamt of! Leslie's worked so hard for us, and we could not be happier."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I called with less than a week until my event and the cake I picked up far surpassed my expectations. My son was so happy when he saw it, this definitely made his fifth birthday one to remember.   The cake tastes amazing as well, so it's an all around great place!! I'd highly recommend this local spot for its convenience, pricing, quality and customer service. Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"They did an amazing job for my boyfriends 40th birthday cake!! Turned out better than I could imagine!! Highly recommend them to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cake from here after getting several quotes and went with Lesley's because she quoted me about half the price compared to the other places.  I can happily say that I got way more than I paid for. The cake was absolutely perfect. It was super moist and delicious, the decorating was was beautiful, and it was ready for pick up on time.  I would highly recommend Lesley to anyone else in need of a cake!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my daughters 21st birthday.  I requested a white/yellow cake with Bavarian cream and strawberries.  The cake itself was pretty.  It was covered in white fondant and the cake itself was very moist.  However, the filling was almost non-existent.   There was a VERY thin layer of Bavarian cream and the strawberries were cut almost paper thin and there were hardly any to mention.  There was so little filling you could not tell there was any to begin with.  I paid $55.00 for the 6\" cake.  Even though it was pretty, not worth the price."}
{"text":"We ordered a 6\" cake and about 80 cupcakes with the rose flower frosting design from Lesley and our flowers (baby's breath for the center and aisle pieces and three bouquets of white tiger lilies) from Christine for our wedding this past May, and we couldn't have been any happier with how things turned out! The cake/cupcakes tasted amazing and everything looked absolutely beautiful. Both ladies were easy to communicate with, the rates for were quite reasonable and everything was above and beyond our expectations. Thank you both for helping make our day so memorable! -Kim & Nick"}
{"text":"We used Lesley's Creative Cakes for our wedding and would highly recommend her services for any type of event, or just a sweet tooth in general! I came in with only an idea of what I was looking for, and Lesley had suggestions that made my visions a reality! Lesley is so down to Earth and treats you as family. Lesley gave me her honest opinion of what she thought would look good with my theme and what she would recommend staying away from. Her attention to detail shows in her work and it was such a relief to not have to stress about our wedding cake with all the other stresses surrounding planning a wedding!  On the day we came to pick up our wedding cake, Lesley had it packaged in ready to go traveling coolers that worked amazing.  The presentation of our wedding cake was beautiful, but the flavor was absolutely the best part! I have heard horror stories about brides having a beautiful wedding cake that lacked in flavor, but with Lesley that was not even a worry! The guests and my husband (most important!) loved the cake!  We are so happy with the service from Lesley's Creative Cakes and are looking forward to using her for any future needs."}
{"text":"I had a custom designed cake done to look like a record player.  What a great job they did!  The cake flavor was margarita cake with a custard filling that was so moist and delicious.  It was a big hit!!  Thank you Leslies!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used Lesley's Creative Cakes for our wedding cake and it was amazing!!!!  My mom was the one who recommended Lesley. She had purchased her mini cupcakes for a very large party, where she said they were a huge hit!   We met with Lesley just a couple days before the wedding and she was so helpful. My husband and I knew we wanted lemon cupcakes, but we were uncertain about also doing a lemon cake. Lesley suggested a lemon cake with a custard with raspberry filling and a lemon buttercream frosting. The cake was so beautiful and absolutely to die for!!!!  I would definitely use her again and recommend her to others!"}
{"text":"My husband and I choose Lesley's creative cakes, we loved every flavor she had at the tasting and at the wedding Everyone loved the cake!!!"}
{"text":"If you ever need a beautiful flower arrangement, this is the place to go! I was taking care of the flowers for my best friend's wedding and went with Lesley's and her business partner Christine, and I am so glad I did! Christine was very accommodating with my extremely busy work schedule and ensured everything was exactly the way the bride wanted it! The bridal bouquet was absolutely beautiful! Christine was even able to get the sunflowers that are my best friend's favorite flower, even though they were out of season. I am truly amazed at Christine's dedication to ensuring everything went smoothly."}
{"text":"We were married on 11/21/15 and we couldn't be more pleased with Lesley and her staff. She made my dream wedding cake. It was everything I wanted and tasted amazing. She was also able to create an amazing Grooms Cake for my husband. It was a special surprise.  Thank you for everything, Lesley we will be sure to do more business with you in the future."}
{"text":"The Shopkins cake they made was perfect! It was exactly what I pictured and the flavor was amazing! We got so many compliments, it was definitely a HUGE success! The team was friendly and had great communication throughout our experience. We will be coming back for every party/occasion we need a cake! Great job!!!"}
{"text":"I only needed a small cake and bouquet on short notice for an elopement.  I was worried that a business that is accustomed to doing large weddings/events would not want to work with such a small order, but Lesley and Christine had no problem working with me.  I also had a last-minute color change request for the flowers and Christine made it work...it was lovely! The cake was delicious and exactly what what I had in mind.  Thank you ladies!"}
{"text":"We used Lesley's for our daughters baptism cake and cupcakes..the cake looked and tasted amazing.  The banana cake was delicious and very moist. All our guest we're impressed by how beautiful the cake was and most of all the taste!  We will definitely use Lesley's for our daughters 1st birthday cake as well!!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my daughters 1st birthday last week and it was awesome! I spent months planning this event and 5 days before the party I realized I forgot about the cake! I had cup cakes, but no cake! Naturally panicking, I found Lesley's Creative Cakes and took a chance.  Wow! First off, I spoke with Lesley directly, she was very accommodating, friendly and professional. She was able to quickly take my order with such short notice. I sent her a picture of what I wanted and gave her details over the phone.   The cake was AMAZING! I chose the funfetti flavored cake with glazed strawberries and it was just perfect! Everyone loved it, NO leftovers.   Needless to say, I will be ordering from Lesley for many years to come."}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes was AMAZING! My husband and I wanted to have a large assortment of desserts for our wedding and Lesley and her team fulfilled that request. We had a donut wall, small pastries, and a cake. My husband has a weakness for cheesecake so we asked for mini cheesecakes, which were incredibly tasty. Not only was the wedding cake delicious, but the design was beautiful. We cannot wait to eat the top layer next year on our anniversary. Thank you for making our wedding day so SWEET :)"}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service.  These gals called us a month before our one year anniversary and offered to remake the top of our cake for our anniversary celebration.  Plus they were super helpful in helping us select our flavor a for our big day.  This level of service had earned our lifelong business.  Also, the cake turned out delicious, try the vanilla strawberry, so fresh."}
{"text":"I loved the cake I ordered for my sons birthday. I had to order it last minute (1 week ahead) and she was able to do it. Not only that, but I had a design change in the middle of that week and she accommodated me really well. I will be ordering more cakes in the future from here!!! Thank youuuuuu sooo much"}
{"text":"I was looking for cupcakes for my daughter's graduation party, and went to the cake tasting so my daughter could get an idea of what she wanted.  The cakes were delicious, the ordering process was easy,  and they were able to create the vision I was looking for! The cupcakes turned out beautiful and were a hit at the party! Thank you Lesley!"}
{"text":"We ordered a 6\" chocolate cake with fudge filling for our wedding and it was the most delicious cake we've ever had!!! Will be highly recommending and using her again in the future!"}
{"text":"After ordering a specialty cake for my husband's 40th birthday that turned out amazing we decided to have them do our wedding cake.  The cake turned out amazing and the pricing wasn't outrageous.  They worked within our budget and we still had three different flavor options.  Our guests still talk about how good the cake was.  Lesley was wonderful to work with, really went above and beyond to win our business and keep us coming back for more.  Can't beat good customer service and great cake!  Life needs more cake."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a perfect experience working with Lesley for our wedding cake. She is a kind, generous, and fun person and the cake was amazing! Not a piece was left and all three flavored she crafted for us got rave reviews from the wedding guests."}
{"text":"Cake was gorgeous, shape of law textbooks for law school graduation. She also made it on short notice. Whole party was bewildered by the cake!"}
{"text":"My new husband and I chose to do cupcakes for our wedding. Lesley's was great to work with, especially having tastings available to try several flavors. I would definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"We loved our cake, mini cupcakes and brownies from Lesley's Creative Cakes! Lesley and team were so easy to work with and just to the point, which is what I like! We picked out flavors and I discussed my image for the cake and it was done! Love their team for amazing looking and tasting cakes! Awesome prices too!   Can't wait to order from there again!"}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the wonderful set up at my wedding with a brownie cake, confetti cake, lemon bars, and mini snickerdoodle cupcakes.  Everything was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone!  I appreciate the dietary restriction accommodations that we're offered as well!  I loved the monthly tastings!  We will definitely recommend and use you guys again"}
{"text":"Leslie's Creative Cakes was amazing! Leslie worked with us to find our wedding cake, and did not disappoint. She was friendly, knowledgeable, and was able to produce a beautiful and delicious cake (well, 3 layers of different but equally amazing cakes). Oh, she and my wife schemed to make a groom's cake (Rice Krispie Treat) haha.  Thank you again for all of your help Leslie!  Geoff and Rorey"}
{"text":"We ordered our wedding cake from Leslie's for our wedding a year ago. Not only was the cake delicious, it was really pretty. I sent an example of what I wanted and they made it happen. We were very happy with the beautiful cake."}
{"text":"After calling around and receiving multiple quotes Lesley's Creative Cakes by far had the best pricing. I sent in a picture of the cake I wanted and it came out exactly like the picture, and tasted delicious! Additionally, I got stuck late at work and was a couple of hours late picking up my cake. It was a Saturday and they had deliveries to make but were so understanding and didn't make me feel bad. I'm a nurse and so I can't just leave if my shift is over if there is a patient that needs me. I am so happy with the perfect cake I received, and the icing on top was the kind customer service from Lesley. Don't go anywhere else, they're good people, low priced, and make gorgeous cakes!"}
{"text":"I was astonished at how beautiful the cake I ordered turned out. My birthday gal friend freaked out in joy. Thank you so much! It tasted great too! What craftsmanship! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Leslie's Creative Cakes! My wedding was in early 2015, and although it has taken me some time to get around to writing this review, the joy I feel when I think about level of customer service she provided when I think back on our special day speaks volumes. She offered us a more-than-fair price and Leslie was a pleasure to work with. For our cake, we chose vanilla with salted caramel for two layers and a mint chocolate chip with fudge filling for the bottom layer. For the grooms cake we went a Batman logo, chocolate with chocolate filling. People are still talking about our cake a year and a half later. It was elegant and delicious, matching exactly what we asked. We ate the entire top layer at our one year anniversary! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"I contacted Ms. Lesley in the late afternoon on Wednesday December 9 to inquire about a 50th Anniversary cake that I need Thursday December 10th and she came through with a gorgeous, decadent cake. Lesley's is my hero I will use her exclusively for all my future cake orders."}
{"text":"LOVED my wedding cake! It was such a pleasant experience picking out a design and flavor wit this company. The staff was friendly and patient. I was able to communicate through email and they did whatever that could to make me happy. They also have such a variety of flavors. They were very helpful with ideas, too!"}
{"text":"Lesley and her team are nothing short of amazing.  Not only are her cakes BEAUTIFUL, she uses real buttercream frosting...no fondant that looks pretty but tastes horrible.  We were admittedly very particular about about everything from the flavors, to the design, and the delivery and she far exceeded our expectations.  There really is something here for everyone.  She offers a wide variety of unique and traditional flavors and fillings, and can do just about any design from simple to very intricate.  I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I contacted Lesley's to do a custom birthday cake. Despite my using examples from various photos for different cake components (ex: lettering, small decorative flowers, etc.), it was like they knew exactly what I wanted and took the image in my mind and replicated it perfectly in the final product.  This was a very special surprise cake for my biological sister visiting and meeting me for the first time from Korea. She loved it, and everyone thought it was delicious! They all thought the flowers (South Korea national flower) were so detailed and beautiful, also. Thank you Lesley's Creative Cakes"}
{"text":"Lesley's creative cakes made my daughters wedding cake.  The cake was so amazing and so fresh.  She had one layer of snickerdoodle and one layer almond flavored .  Oh my goodness it was so good.  I would recommend this bakery to anyone who is need of a cake.  They were amazing to work with. They were reliable and the presentation of my daughters wedding cake was beautiful."}
{"text":"We order our cakes from Lesleys's Creative cakes. We had a 1/2 sheet of chocolate fudge with glazed strawberries and a funfetti smash caked for Our son's first birthday. Our theme was little monster. The smash cake was in the shape of the little monster. It was so cute we almost didn't want to have it smashed. The half sheet cake was bigger than expected. Both cakes were delicious and very beautiful! Big hit at the party! Thank you for such an adorable and yummy cames! Our order was placed through text messaging. Fast, friendly, and very convenient!"}
{"text":"We used Lesley for our wedding cake vendor at the Windmill Winery. The cake was very good and she was able to replicate the design we found on pinterest.  The only thing I wish was an option and wasn't would be one on one cake tasting. I had always seen that in movies and was excited to sit down with my husband to be and sample all the cake and filling options. But they don't offer this, maybe because they are very busy with all the weddings they do. You have to go to a open house once a month and try what they have available that day.  Overall I am happy with Lesley's cakes and our guests also raved about how good the cake was at our wedding! We were able to do a different flavor for each tier which I liked. We also ordered a plate of brownies that were devoured, and it was only a few dollars extra to add on :)"}
{"text":"Lesley's is amazing!!! Their cakes are always made fresh, are moist, and they have a variety of awesome flavors and filings. They do free cake tastings, and always have time for you, unlike other places!! We got a two tiered cake for a 30 person engagement party (coconut with coconut filing) and it came out AMAZING! We brought in a picture of an abstract mermaid and they were able to recreate it by hand using food coloring on fondant. It got many compliments and guests who didn't like sweets or coconut LOVED the cake. We give 5 stars for great service, great taste, and great design! Lesley's has got it all for your cake needs!"}
{"text":"Lesley makes the most delicious cakes, lemon bars, cookies, brownies, and even gluten free options! She is so timely and if you need something last minute she is your gal! I would highly recommend Lesley's Creative Cakes Flowers & Catering to my friends and family for any event. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"thank you so much for making the most beautiful and delicious cake for my wedding. Leslie is so easy to work with and her cakes are top notch and her prices are more than fair.the possible flavor combinations that she offers are endless and my guests loved them so much that there were only 2 slices left!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love these cakes. Leslie does an amazing job creating the cakes even better than what I envisioned. She also catered to our soy intolerance which was a huge plus. BIG thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Lesley's Creative Cakes at a Bridal Open House. My husband and I got married on April 30, 2017. Lesley did a phenomenal job on our wedding cake! It was gorgeous and delicious. Lesley offered opportunities for my husband and I to taste a variety of cake options. She took the time to sit down with us before the big day to discuss our vision of the cake. Lesley noted every detail and added her expertise to create a cake that was perfect! She delivered the cake in plenty of time and was very professional during the entire process. If that wasn't enough, Lesley even followed up with me a few weeks before my one year anniversary with details to make a replica cake. She is the best!"}
{"text":"We had Lesley do a desserts bar for our wedding and they were amazing. She let us pick the desserts we wanted and walked us through the whole process. We brought her the plates we wanted them displayed on and she delivered a beautiful presentation on our great day! Guests raved about how delicious it all was."}
{"text":"Cakes and goodies are the most important part of a Baby Shower and Lesley's creative cakes team knows this very well.  Cake Design and taste: Lesley's creative cakes delivered what they promised. The cake design was exactly what we ordered and the cake was delicious. They have a ton of flavors to chose from. We also ordered cake pops and cup cakes, again, very delicious and perfect.  Communication: Although the owner seems to be very busy, she made sure we communicated well(via emails and phone) to decide on cake flavors and design. She also made sure that the cake was not too big for the party we had. The best part about my whole experience with Lesley is that she never said no to anything I asked for, be it the cake design or the cup cakes or the cake pops.  Taste: Delicious, Delicious and more Delicious.  Pricing: Since Lesley's cakes are very good at what they do, they don't bargain. They are decently priced.  Overall Experience: Excellent Recommend: Hands Down YES.  I am glad I hired them to make the cake. A job well done.."}
{"text":"We have used Lesley's creative cakes for the past 2-3 years for both simple sheet cakes and above and beyond cakes. I love using this bakery vs. a grocery store because of the service, the taste and freshness of the cakes. Recently ordered a cake for my daughter's 7th birthday. I gave Leslie a picture from Pinterest I wanted to re-create. She gave me ideas of where I can cut costs due to my budget. Also because I am so busy she made it easy to communicate via text and email. Cake was ready on time and it turned out great! Selfishly, I order a bit more than I should because I want leftovers!!"}
{"text":"I got a cake for my friends 23rd birthday and it came out amazing!! He loved it very much. Thank you."}
{"text":"Her cakes are amazing.  We have bought several cakes from her and were never disappointed.  She is very creative with her cakes.  She can do anything you ask of her.  The taste of her cakes are out of this world.  I highly recommend Lesley's Creative Cakes.  I know I will be using her again in the near future."}
{"text":"This service is the best I have gotten in town. They serviced my needs for a cake last year. We were celebrating my son's 5th birthday, and the team did an espectacular job with a Paw Patrol cake. We had provided them with the toys to go around he cake. However, they made a paw/bone shape figure for the cake (very creative). Everyone loved it!  This year, I almost forgot about the set up for my son's 6th birthday. Yet, they saved me once again. I received a text, asking me if I will like them to make a cake for me a week before the party. And I took them on the offer, they baked an Angry Birds cake. This cake came out phenomenal, it was the center of attention in the party. These ladies honestly do an awesome job. The faces of the birds came out just like what you see on the characters. It's like they copy and paste the image you send them. They CAN DO ANYTHING you want on your cake. I love love love their service.   Here is the picture of our cake. Sadly after my husband picked up the cake and was taking it home he got cut off. He had to slam on the brakes and the cake smeared a bit. But we saved the cake for the party."}
{"text":"I ordered my graduation cake here and omg it was delicious. I didn't know exactly how I wanted my cake to look so I emailed them a couple pictures and let them decide what would look best and it came out so pretty and perfect. I was extremely happy with the outcome. Not to mention the frosting was one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"First of all I just have to say Lesley is amazing as what she does! My cake was BEAUTIFUL! When I get pictures I will post one! We also did desserts including key lime pies cheesecakes and the ultimate hit of the night salted Carmel brownies! My new husband and I ate the top of our cake the following week as we didn't get any the night of because we were too busy! We devoured the cake at home though! I would recommend Lesley to anyone who is getting married she takes your ideas and perfects them!    Can't wait to eat it again at our one year!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering desert from them for past 3 years it is amazing! I honestly only order from them it doesn't matter if it's for a wedding, birthday party, baby shower, graduation party, or just get together I'm never disappointed. I am not a big cake fan but when it's from them I just love it and can't stop eating it"}
{"text":"Our wedding cake was AMAZING.  Leslie was very helpful in helping us vision the cake we were wanting.  I showed her two pictures and she knew exactly what we were looking for.  We did a cupcake tower and a big cupcake on top.  It was beautiful and our guests loved it!  And...The cake tasted amazing!  We were so happy to enjoy our cake as husband and wife.  We would recommend Lesley's 100% :)"}
{"text":"We LOVE Lesley and her company! They are amazing, fairly priced, and have the best tasting cake in town. I would highly recommend her to all of our friends , family, and anyone!"}
{"text":"Not only did our wedding cake look exactly as we wanted it to look, it tasted amazing! Even several days after the left overs were great, however it's so good that left overs didn't last long.  Lesley set the cake up on location and was in and out so fast I hardly noticed her. We have hired her for birthday cakes and just highly recommend this company all around."}
{"text":"This review is for my very positive experience with the floral side of the business. My sister got married 4 years ago and used Lesley's Creative Cakes for both her wedding cake and flowers, so I decided to use them for the baby shower I threw for my sister and I was very pleased with the two center-pieces and five side bouquets Christine made. I live in California, so all of our exchanges had to be through emails (for picture references) and phone calls, and it turned out even better than I was expecting! I highly recommend based on both quality and customer service"}
{"text":"My boyfriend surprised me with a birthday cake from Lesley! It was so special! She made a beautiful peony (my favorite flower) out of sugar that was absolutely stunning. Besides being beautiful it was an amazingly tasty cake! Flavorful and just the right balance of filling and cake. Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a birthday cake for my boyfriend at the last minute. I found an image online that I wanted (guinness cake...yes, the beer) and asked if they could make that on such short notice. Not only did they make it, it was early and it was DELICIOUS. Seriously good. I've also had a few different flavors of the cake balls...omg. They are melt in your mouth fab. Do yourself a favor and check out Lesley's."}
{"text":"Ordered a cake from Leslie's and it turned out perfect! We weren't sure on a flavor because of all of the combinations, so she gave us some recommendations and we went with one of them Strawberry cake with Buttercream cream cheese filling) and it was delicious. Very accommodation as well, as they were literally in the middle of moving stores. The cake looked amazing and my daughter absolutely loved it. Will definitely be using them again!"}
{"text":"Our cake and desserts looked and tasted amazing last night. Thank you so much for creating such a beautiful dessert bar. All the planning and talking over the last year really paid off. Thank you so much. Lesley's will be our Baker from now on."}
{"text":"Lesley's cake was amazing! We use them for our wedding at the Windmill Winery.  The cake/ cupcakes were so yummy and they set it up perfect! I would highly recommend! My son has a birthday coming up and I will definitely be getting his cake here!"}
{"text":"We had Lesley make carrot cake cupcakes for our baby shower this past weekend. We needed something that was AIP (Autoimmune Protocol) compliant and Lesley did a great job with it. the cupcakes were nice and tender which doesn't often happen with AIP desserts, and even the icing tasted like a carrot cake icing. Everyone loved the cupcakes, including the people that didn't know they were AIP."}
{"text":"I searched all over for an affordable first birthday cake for my daughter. Leslie made a beautiful cake at a great price! I will definitely be using her again. Thank you Leslie!"}
{"text":"We used Lesley's cakes for our wedding cake, and it was delicious! We chose a crumb coat, because, no one really likes fondant anyway. The cake was moist and delicious and beautiful. As the bride, I left the decorations I wanted on the cake up at the cake table, and Lesley's took care of the rest when they set it up. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Our cake was perfect for our rustic country wedding! I wanted a version of the naked cakes I had seen but I wanted three tiers, all different flavors. It was perfect in every way! My husband and I were so busy at our wedding we only tasted it for the \"cake cutting pictures\" but we got lots of compliments on all the flavors and grateful guests who thanked us for the options rather than just one flavor.   Lesley must have read my mind because as our one year anniversary approached I considered ordering a small cake for just us and before I could hunt her down, she called me to offer her services! How thoughtful!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a cake for my daughter in law's baby shower. We attended one of the tasting sessions, and we're able to squeeze in our consult and order at the same time. Lesley asked a ton of helpful questions which helped us create our perfect cake! We opted for delivery (additional minimal fee) and she arrived right on time; cake fully intact! The flavors we picked tasted amazing and it was decorated exactly as we requested. It was a pleasure working with them and will definitely recommend and order here again!"}
{"text":"I am a cake fanatic.  I love to have pretty cakes and always try to have themed cakes for all of my children's birthdays.  Lesley was super awesome and easy to work with.  She's very flexible and her cakes have been really amazing.  I've ordered over half a dozen birthday and special event cakes from her and we were never disappointed.  Her cakes not only look amazing, but they were delicious."}
{"text":"I just ordered another cake from Lesley's. It was for my husband's surprise 50th birthday and it became the centerpiece of the party. It was so amazing, that some folks didn't even realize it was a cake.... and it was a DELICIOUS! Thanks Lesley....can't wait to have a reason to order another cake."}
{"text":"We got our wedding cake from Lesley's and it was the best decision! She took our ideas and created a cake that was better than we could have ever imagined. Our guests were so impressed! If you're looking for friendly service and a beautiful cake that tastes even better, Lesley's is the place!"}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes is definitely a must go to if your looking for that special cake for that special someone. Or for whatever celebration your doing. I highly recommend going here  and no we're else you won't be disappointed. I was so excited when I saw the cake it was perfect I was in awe. no flaws whatsoever, and it was so delicious. She was so helpful and called and we walked through it together and she worked her magic. Thankyou so much for the cake it made my fiancé's birthday so special everyone loved it"}
{"text":"I will say \"Creative\" is an under statement for the Lesley and her team. I was introduce the team from my wedding vender, my Husband and I where so glad we chose the Lesley's for our cake vender. Not only where the guest non stop speaking about our CREATIVE cakes, but also how delicious they tasted. We definitely started a new family tradition for all future family event that requires a cake! : )"}
{"text":"Lesley knows her cakes!! One bite will convince you that you made the right decision! Lesley goes beyond what is expected. I wouldn't have anyone else make your cake for any occasion. Her wedding cakes are incredible. I have had her make mini cupcakes for an event and they were adorable. High five Lesley!"}
{"text":"Lesley's cakes and cookies are the best!  She made a glutton free cake for me for Valentines Day!  The icing was very yummy.  I got heart cookies for all my grandchildren which were just as delicious.  I am never disappointed with Lesley, she goes beyond my expectation!"}
{"text":"My wife and I initially met Lesley at the Phoenix Bridal Expo and at that moment just from speaking with her, we knew she loved doing what she does. We met with her at one of the cake tasting/open houses at her business location and we fell in love all over again after tasting her flavors. The whole process was seamless and we couldn't have asked for anything better.  We were married on October 14, 2016 at Tre Bella and people still comment on the cake we ordered from Lesley. We chose red velvet, orange dreamsicle and vanilla with fresh strawberries. She has gained a customer for life and will be the first person we go to for our cake needs. I will update the review with photos once I receive them :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I chose Lesley's for our wedding cake, and it was amazing!! Loved her willingness to cooperate with our idea's, and of course it was a beautiful cake and delicious!"}
{"text":"Get your cake from here!  So yummy.  We ordered their smallest cake and got almond with buttercream filling.  It may be the best cake I have ever had!  Delicious.  Also- super cute.  I sent in a picture of an idea for a cake and they replicated it exactly.  You won't be disappointed with Lesley's Creative Cakes!"}
{"text":"Lesley was extremely easy to work with, and has amazing dessert options, we chose her for our wedding cake and dessert table and she did an wonderful job! Our guests couldn't stop saying how good the dessert was!"}
{"text":"My son used Lesley for his wedding cake and it was very very good, so I decided I would use Lesley for my own wedding on 4/8/17.  The cake was beautiful, the colors I wanted and design. Good flavors also, she has a really good cookies and cream flavor. I  had 2 tier cake for a max of 50 people, but only ended up having about 30 people and I wanted to have a lot of cake leftover for the next few days, but there really wasn't as much as I had wanted, so I could have used an extra tier or perhaps larger tiers, but overall, it was a good experience and I even found my DJ at one of her cake tastings and he was great also. I even got a compliment later from a coworker thanking us for having really good wedding cake!  So thank you Lesley!"}
{"text":"When my wife and I went to the Bridal Open House at Windmill Winery, we knew immediately who we would be working with for our cake. Lesley not only had a wide selection of cake choices to choose from, but her enthusiasm and personality made her easy to talk to.  We visited her shop for one of her open houses a few months before the wedding to re-sample the cakes and get a feel for how the whole order process was going to go. She had another batch of her more popular cakes out for people to try while she did on the spot consultations with people that came in looking for one.  We got to sample Orange Dreamsicle, Funfetti, Mint Chocolate Chip, Margarita, lemon bars, and some brownie bites. There was also a Peanut Butter Chocolate cake that Meg loved but Peanut butter and I don't get along so I can't speak to that one. All the flavors were to die for and 100% on point to their name. \"Yeah, can I just take this whole cake table home with me please? kthxbye\" Absolutely amazing cakes. We also got the opportunity to look at some of her portfolios and see just how versatile she was with her cakes. If you've looked in the gallery here, you already have a good idea of what we saw. Totally impressed.  We came back a few weeks later with a set appointment for our cake consultation. After seeing what she could do I was admittedly worried about how long this would take and how much my wallet may cry over the cost of what we were looking to do. Given that Meg and I love Harry Potter, had our first date at a book release, and went to more than one midnight movie showing, we definitely knew we wanted to incorporate that into our wedding cake and came in with multiple images and ideas in hand.  Not only was Lesley thrilled with our ideas, she immediately went to drafting and outlining the cake she had in mind, incorporating Harry's wand, the Elderwand, snitches, and a Marauder's Map style \"Mischief Managed\" banner all in a matter of minutes. To top it off, when she noticed we were considering using fondant for one of the layers (which would have been an upgrade and cost extra) she pulled one of her portfolios and showed us what buttercream flowers would look like. Not only was she right that we would like this better, but it was one of the designs that would be included in the Windmill package.   When all was said and done, we had spent *maybe* 20 minutes going over the cake, got to sample even more cake (anytime I can get free cake is a good time), didn't have to pay anything extra outside our package, and we had our dream cake ordered with a tier of mint, funfetti, and orange dreamsicle. We left extremely excited and on a sugar high.  When the big day came, the cake was there on time and looking absolutely amazing. Only trouble we had with it was a snitch that wanted to free itself from it's perch at first but a quick adjustment got it to stay put until it was time to demolish the cake. The cake was and still is one of the most talked about things from our wedding. Everyone loved the Dreamsicle and Funfetti cake. We held onto the Mint cake topper and shared it a few days later with some friends at a local brewery. We even shared some with some of the other patrons who were as enamored with it as our wedding guests.  Needless to say, we were both extremely happy with the work Lesley did. Very friendly, easy to work with, super talented, and did I mention awesome cakes? I definitely know where I'm going the next time I need a cake for a special event. Thank you again Lesley!  Side note for other WIndmill couples: Both times we were at Lesley's she had a florist and Kiss The Chef Catering in for her open house as well. So you may be able to knock out three steps in one trip!"}
{"text":"Loved my cake they absolutely nailed the design I was wanting! Will definitely order from Lesley's again"}
{"text":"We ordered our wedding cake and also did a mini dessert bar from Lesley's creative cakes. The cake was not only beautiful but also super tasty (almond with cannoli filling was my favorite)! And the dessert bar was a total hit! The lemon squares and brownies are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Our cake was so beautiful! I remember when i first saw it... i had to do a double take because she completely exceeded our expectations. Going with Lesley's was hands down the easiest decision we made when planning our wedding. Not only did our cake look beautiful but it tasted AMAZING! We chose a cannoli cake with a almond buttercream filling(something like that lol) but it was a hit with our friends and family! We cannot wait to come back for our 1 year anniversary! We highly recommend Lesley's creative cakes for any event! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience from start to finish! I was able to text Lesley what I was thinking and she helped me come up with the perfect cake for our daughters 16th birthday cake. Not only did she do an amazing job decorating it but it tasted so yummy! The red velvet cake with cream cheese and banana with custard were delicious, everyone loved it. We would definitely order again from her. The price of the cake was also very affordable for all the work that was put into the cake."}
{"text":"My husband and I got married a year ago at Windmill Winery and we picked Lesley's Creative Cakes to do our wedding cake. Not only was the cake delicious but the styling of the cake was perfect! She was able to create the image of the perfect cake that I had in my head and bring it to life.  We had a great experience with Lesley's Creative Cake!!"}
{"text":"We used Lesley's for our wedding at the windmill winery and couldn't have been more pleased! They made the cake exactly as we had described. They have a wide variety of flavors. Their spice cake is DELICIOUS! Lesley's is a must for any of your cake or dessert needs!"}
{"text":"I have ordered 2 cakes from here so far and both were excellent!!! The staff is great. Can't wait to have another event and order he next cake!"}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes made my wedding cake, and I have nothing but positive things to say about the whole experience! They provide cake tastings where you can taste all different flavors and discuss designs, and they were responsive and kind throughout our email communications. And the cake... was absolutely perfect. It was better than I could have imagined. It was beautiful and was the best wedding cake I've ever tasted (and I'm not just saying that!). If I could do it again, I'd choose Lesley's!"}
{"text":"My wedding cake was done here and turned out gorgeous and delicious! Lesley sat down with us and was able to help us build the cake we wanted (when we first went in, we had no idea) and it came out exactly how we had pictured it.  Everyone at my wedding thought it was fantastic and most went back for seconds!  Thank you so much Lesley! You did an amazing job!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best bakery ever. No need to go anywhere else! The cupcakes she made were amazing! I had sent a photo in what I wanted, her creations were perfect! In fact they looked better than the photo, and tasted even better! We almost didnt want to eat them as they were done with such artistic perfection, we wanted to just look at them! They tasted as good as they looked. highly recommend this bakery indeed."}
{"text":"Lesley was the most attentive and helpful vendor I had to deal with during my wedding planning! I had a very large wedding and wanted every tier a different flavor for more options and she did that for me with no problem at all. I was able to text her pictures and ideas as they came to me. She always responds and gets back to you quickly. Never seems to busy for you. Thank you again for everything Lesley! Can't wait for my one year anniversary cake!"}
{"text":"Lesley created such a Beautiful cake for my daughter's 1st Holy Communion & Confirmation reception...the cake was absolutely delicious..We received so many compliments..Lesley was professional, kind and very easy to work with..We will definitely use Lesley's Creative Cakes in the future!!!!"}
{"text":"From start to finish Lesley's cakes was a wonderful experience! Very professional and the cakes flavors were amazing and a hit on our big day!!! I highly suggest this bakery for any bride!!!"}
{"text":"Lesley is the best! I have ordered a few cakes from her and each and every time they are beautiful and taste delicious!! It's hard to find a cake that not only looks good but tastes good too!"}
{"text":"In past couple of months we have purchased three cakes from Lesley's.   I couldn't be happier with them.  Taste is incredible and the work that they do is simply amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience! It's such a charming place with a lot of character and the food was delicious! We were in a group of 6 of us and we all loved our breakfast dishes and had awesome service! I would highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a sweet 16 cake for my daughter. Although the cake was good and nicely done, one of the tiers flavor was wrong. I emailed to advise of such, in hopes of getting some type of resolution. I thought it was only fair that she credit me at least 20-25% as the order was WRONG, and considering we ended up not eating most of it because it wasn't what she wanted...however her reply was insincere and all she offered was a \"10% discount on a future order\"...why in the world would I order from her again if she didn't even care she made an error in the FIRST place? Didn't seem all that concerned with customer satisfacation"}
{"text":"My wife and I selected Lesley's to do our wedding cake last year. Needless to say, we had very little of the cake left over because I think the guests came back for seconds. It was by far one of the best cakes we have ever had. Explosive flavor in every layer. Our favorite was the lemon and we are looking forwards to more for our anniversary. I highly recommend Lesley's Creative Cakes for any occasion, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I met Lesley at the Windmill Winery's open house, she was one of the cake vendors available to us from the venue. The cakes we tried at the open house were delicious, so we decided to go with her. We showed her pictures of what we wanted and discussed cake flavors and fillings (which she has a ton of). Lesley was such a pleasure to work with and truly made this process easy and worry free for us, which was great! We will definitely use her again in the future!"}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes provided the wedding cake through my venue Gainey Ranch Golf Club. The cake itself was gorgeous and exactly how I had envisioned it. Not to mention it was delicious. Lesley had recommended the chocolate cake with peanut butter filling and it was a hit! I am also very pleased at how many tastings they offered and that they will make a fresh version for our anniversary (vs. eating frozen 1 year old cake). Great company to work with!"}
{"text":"I ordered a custom cake for my dad's birthday; the cake was exactly what i had pictured and asked for. It tasted as good, if not better, than it looked. The ordering process was simple and hassle free, and the ladies at the shop were very helpful. They Even spent a good 15 mins helping me figure out how to transport it in a car to Tucson for the party. Absolutely recommend this bakery!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got married at the Windmill Winery and choose Lesley's Creative Cakes for our special day. Her cakes far surpassed the completion! She offers so many great flavors, it was a challenge to pick favorites. Everyone had great things to say about our cake! Plus, she was a pleasure to work with. She was able to see my vision and executed it perfectly. My husband and I highly recommend her and will definitely use her again!"}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes was amazing. We all agreed that it was the best birthday cake we've ever had. The cake was exactly like the picture I sent them. The chocolate cake with the caramel filling was a great choice!  I ordered another cake for my daughters 18th birthday and cupcakes for graduation. Lesley's Creative Cakes did not disappoint again. Each item was exactly what we order. The cake and cupcakes were so moist and delicious. You can not go wrong getting cakes and cupcakes from them."}
{"text":"She has made my daughters cakes 2 years in a row for her birthday! And they have been the best cakes I have had so far..... both cookies and cream. No words to describe... Amazing at what she does!"}
{"text":"I chose Lesley's because they were a preferred vendor through Villa Tuscana, which was an amazing venue. The cake tastings are strange cause they only have them once a month and with only 3-4 flavors you can try. So you kinda have to guess which ones you will like unless you start a year in advance so you can taste everything. I was very confident in the bakery until the day of. The cake did not look good! The writing was incredibly sloppy and and \"gold\" was a mustard yellow. I didn't make a fuss then because what could we do? But I waited until I got the pictures back from the photographer. Definitely not what we wanted or agreed on, but it did taste fine. I have included a picture. In the left is what I showed her and the right is our cake. For the $400 price, I would have been happier going to Safeway."}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my Peter Rabbit themed baby shower and I received exactly what I asked for. We needed gluten free, and we got a layer of lemon cake with raspberry filling, and one layer with carrot cake. I was delighted with how pretty the cake was and how delicious! Would definitely use Lesley's again."}
{"text":"We could not have been more pleased with Lesley's for our wedding cake! The cake was beautiful and delicious! We highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"I ordered a cake through Lesley's creative cakes for my nieces wedding. Not only was the cake delicious and exactly what I had asked for, but it was reasonably priced and they were very easy to deal with. I'd highly recommend them to anyone in need of a bakery for either a plain or custom cake!"}
{"text":"Best cakes ever!!!!! Very moist, frosting is just right, and reasonably priced.. Let's not forget their attention to detail on all the designs and custom orders... So far I've had the pleasure of ordering 2 cakes from them... They are officially my to go cake place!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! The cake turned out beyond perfect and it tasted as good as it looked. They listened to all my requests s d it was beyond my imagination."}
{"text":"There are so many GREAT things about Lesley and her company!   I've had the chance to try a dozen of the different bakery items she has created, including cakes and cake balls, and everything she offers is simply scrumptious!  I've never seen her flower creations in person, only in pictures, but they are quite lovely. Last but most certainly not least, the breakfast she serves is spectacular! I've had the chance to hold a couple of business group meetings there, and both times, everything on the menu was delicious!  If you love bruschetta, you absolutely have to try hers!"}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes made our cake for our wedding, and it was absolutely beautiful.  It was just how I imagined it would be, not only looks but taste as well.  The process of choosing and designing our cake was easy and taste testing was delicious.  We opted for 3 different flavors, mint, carrot, and creamsicle (which I am not fan of but absolutely loved as a cake).  For our first anniversary cake we will be getting creamsicle flavor!! Additionally, Lesley made a cake for my husbands brother whose birthday was on our wedding day, the German Chocolate cake was also delicious and beautiful.  Would def recommend Lesley's Creative Cake for any event."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered a cake from Lesley's for our wedding. The cake was exactly what i envisioned. BEST CAKE EVER! Thank you for making our cake dreams come true!"}
{"text":"I love this place and I was looking for a local bakery to make a fun and cool cake for my 8 year old boy. Castle crashers was the theme for his party and let me tell you the cake was a hit. He absolutely it. It tasted just as amazing as it looked. Thank you Leslie for making my little man so happy. We LOVE YOU!"}
{"text":"I'm from alittle town where everyone know everyone so it's easy to know where to get good food, Service, etc.... My sisters birthday is around thanksgiving so I think she always gets cheated out of a cake cause we have so many pies! I wanted to change that this year short notice of course but who now of days plans weeks ahead! We always spend thanksgiving at my sister that lives in Gilbert Az. so I did some research on line trying to find a cake that I was hoping would be good & beautiful! I came across Lesley Creative Cakes all her review sounded great so I called. She was super nice very helpful & didn't sound like it was a inconveniences for her with short notice. She made my sisters cake it was just like I wanted my sisters loved it! And you know it was made from her heart! Isn't that the saying when it's super good? You won't be disappointed!  Thank you Lesley!"}
{"text":"These gals are top notch! I gave them a design for my husband's birthday cake & they made it happen.  He is a singer in a local band and they had a show the night of his Bday in a rock bar.  Lesley's worked with me on the design (I wanted an old-fashioned microphone with the band's logo), how much cake to have for my guests, & what the best icing would go with the flavor I selected.   I can't rave enough!  And the cake doesn't just look pretty....  people were coming back for seconds.  They put down their beers for this cake. It was THAT good.  Don't hesitate using them.   Call them for your occasion NOW!!!"}
{"text":"I love Lesley's creativity in responding to special requests for designs. And I LOVE the taste of the cakes, cake balls, lemon bars, the cookies, ...  Well, you get the idea. Great place to go for your sweet treats."}
{"text":"Love this place.  A great place for breakfast but the cakes are amazing, and real buttercream if you choose buttercream.  Growing up in the Midwest and having a grandfather as a dairyman my grandmother threw a stick of butter in everything.  She lived until she was 83.  So much for they theory it's bad for you.  I can taste the real deal on first bite.  Not margarine, not shortening but butta real butta.....the melt in your moth savor every bite kind.  Great for birthday cakes, wedding cakes, corporate events,  any given Tuesday...let me see yes any reason to have cake.  Like I say in my description more of a sweetie than a foodie.  I just found out that they rent the restaurant for private events.  She has the entire restaurant for YOUR private event. I would say 30 - 50 people?"}
{"text":"Finding a Cake Company that wouldn't cost $$$$ for (2) custom cakes that we needed for same event was a difficult one. We had our little girls 12th Birthday Party Combined with our sons Baby Shower. It was extremely successful but when the cakes came out it was truly a moment of bliss. Everyone loved how they looked I even passed out the business cards they gave me when our guests were asking where the cakes were made.   This is now our go to place for future events. I personally loved how they made the teddy bear on the top of my sons cake, it was something I specifically wanted and seeing the end results was awesome!!!  Oh yes and the TASTE!!!!!!! Was DELICIOUS!!!!! Everyone loved the flavors the Strawberries were fresh and everything was perfect.   Thank you to all the Staff at Lesley Creative Cakes for making our event a great one. I cannot wait to see your new location.   -Jordan"}
{"text":"Was recommended to Lesley's for my wedding cake. She did not disappoint at all. She was able to make a flavor for us. Definitely recommend this place for weddings and any other occasions."}
{"text":"We were charged $75.00 more for a cake design that looked like the sugar was placed and sprayed in gold. It looked horrible. Nothing compared to the design we asked for. Not to mention the cake was dry beyond belief. I don't recommend this place, and should have stuck to my instincts in NOT hiring Lesley as our cake designer."}
{"text":"Her cakes are ok, but her lack of customer service is not. She's very snappy and can be rude. I would not recommend her to anyone. We had her do our wedding cake and an anniversary cake 1 year later."}
{"text":"My husband and I were married at the windmill winery October 2015 and choose Lesley for our wedding cake. I really wish I had a picture to share because it was a really beautiful subtle ombré pink and tasted amazing. We were able to choose three different flavors to please all our guests. I normally don't write reviews but I kinda spaced ordering our anniversary cake, called Lesley with almost no notice, and she was able to get it done. So grateful for that!"}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious, beautiful, and elegant!!! These are the words that come to mind when describing the cake  I received from Lesley's Creative Cake. I sent them a picture of the cake I had in mind for my Girlfriends birthday which was Cinderella themed. It turned out better then I could have ever hoped. My Girlfriend was in awe. I will be using Lesley's for all future cake needs."}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes did a fabulous job on my nieces' wedding cake.  It was by far one of the best tasting cakes I've had in a long time.  Everyone at our table commented on the flavors and wanted another piece.  We had a chocolate and an almond. Flavored cake.  It was Very moist, great texture and beautifully decorated!!!  You can't go wrong, we highly recommend her cakes to end a magical night!!!"}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes did our wedding cake for my wife and me. We ordered a three tiered cake and the flavors from the bottom were coconut with mixed fruit and custard, red velvet with cream cheese, vanilla with buttercream. The presentation and design were absolutely amazing, only to be outdone by the delicious flavors. I would absolutely recommend Lesley's Creative Cakes to anyone looking for an incredible cake!"}
{"text":"I received a beautiful, delicious cake despite giving only a few days notice.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with Lesley's Creative Cakes.  When we first tasted the mint cake we knew we wanted it for our wedding.  It was a subtle and unique flavor.  We were pleasantly surprised to learn that Lesley's Creative Cakes was a venue that partnered with our wedding venue.  We attended a cake tasting and met with Lesley to go over our flavors and design for the cake.  We showed her pictures and she paid close attention to what we liked and helped us design a wonderful cake.  She was very organized and quick with communication.  Everything was set up perfectly on the big day and it was a hit! I highly recommend Lesley's Creative Cakes."}
{"text":"Lesleys Creative Cakes was so wonderful to work with! They made my dream of a wedding cake come true! I didn't want a traditional looking wedding cake so we went with Black!! All my desserts (cookies that say \"i do\" and cookies with our wedding date on them, lemons bars and mini cupcakes) made my dessert table so cute and memorable. I would go back to Lesleys for anything I need! She was such a joy to work with!!"}
{"text":"Tasted 4 cakes today and all were very moist. Liked the frosting too. All sugared out. The chocolate cake was my favorite. Need some milk."}
{"text":"I called up Lesley this morning and asked her if she could deliver a cake and flowers to my brother TOMORROW for his birthday. She said SURE!! At 11:30 am here in the Bay Area, she agreed to deliver a cake to his doorstep in Gilbert, AZ  tomorrow morning at 9:30. Wow!  She was so pleasant, upbeat and helpful. I really enjoyed talking to her, and it wouldn't be too much to say that she brightened my day."}
{"text":"Lesley's was amazing to work with! We started with going to one of their free monthly cake and dessert tastings and were hooked. We ordered a 3 layer cake with chocolate, margarita lime and vanilla. I went back a few weeks later and secretly ordered a groom cake as well. Both cakes came out amazing! Guests raved about the flavors and presentation. When the 3 tier cake was brought, the driver had forgotten the groom cake since it was on a different order but went back to get it before the ceremony started. I didn't even know about this happening until after the wedding. Great service, reasonable prices and deliciousness!"}
{"text":"She did an amazing job on my sons first birthday cake! We had a Maui/Moana themed party so I found a cake cake on pinterest I really wanted. I sent her the picture and she made it exactly like the picture I sent! It was the talk of the party and everyone loved the cake! It was soo moist and delicious. The service was great and Lesley was very personable."}
{"text":"Wow. I wish I could have given an extra bonus star to this review.   I have used a different cake company for years up until recently when they were not returning my call. Desperate to find a new creative cake bakery, I drove by Lesley's shop on Baseline road. Fate. I gave her a call, and explained my situation and that I needed a super unique cake for the weekend, which was 4 days away. She responded with \"no problem! I'll even have it done a day early!\" Music to my ears!!! I told her the theme of my son's birthday (locks and keys) and i let her run wild with whatever she wanted to come up with. The Master lock cake she made was so realistic and well made, not to mention, it tasted so yummy with the fresh strawberry layers! It was a HUGE hit with my son and the entire party. Everyone couldn't even believe it was a cake!! Mission accomplished! Oh! And when the cake was ready, she called and let me know I could pick it up, and even offered to deliver it to my house! Above and beyond anything I expected. I highly recommend Lesley's creative cakes to ANYONE and EVERYONE looking for a memorable cake for any special occasion."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and needed a cake for my husbands birthday and yelp did not let me down! I gave them a theme and left creativeness up to them and the cake turned out amazing! Not only does it look great, but it was so flavorful. I'm always nervous getting larger cakes made for an event because some places make them so generically that they end up tasting like cardboard- I can assure you that Lesley's does not!!! We got strawberry cake with strawberry custard filling for the bottom layer and funfetti for the top layer with a buttercream filling! Delicious!!! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have to tell you, there are SO many things to stress about when it comes to planning a wedding.  Cake was something I stressed about.  What if people didn't like it?  What if it didn't make it to the reception? What if, what if, what if.    The ladies over at Lesley's Creative Cakes were AMAZING!  The cake was the least stressful part of my wedding planning.  I must admit, when I went in for their open house tasting and ordering it was so easy I was actually hesitant.  I figured, there is no way that it could be so easy to pick a flavor and a style and give them my date and reception location and just have it show up.  There had to be more to it?! Nope.  EASY.    AND THE CAKE?! SOOOO delicious.  Everyone raved about it and it was so beautiful, I didn't want to cut into it.  I would HIGHLY recommend Lesley's Creative Cakes for all your wedding cake needs :) A++"}
{"text":"We used this store for our wedding and it was amazing. We did a steam punk themed cake which is on the website gallery. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We got a friend in Lesley! She made us comfortable and confident during our planning process, and was flexible with our last minute/unusual requests. Our wedding cake was spectacular and delicious!  The key is to communicate with her and trust her creativity, and she will amaze you! Thank you Lesley's!"}
{"text":"Let me just tell you how AMAZING Lesley is. She is so kinda and patient with us! Although we wanted a simple cake, she knocked it out of the park! We got married June 15, 2017 at the Windmill Winery. We went to her open houses and cake tasting so many times and had fallen in love with every single cake! It was so good and so so hard for us to pick! We ultimately picked a chocolate cake with peanut butter, a white cake with fresh strawberry filling and a coconut cake with a fudge filling and my guest LOVED every single flavor that was served! I have also used Lesley to make a birthday cake for my step dad that was the chocolate peanut butter and he loved that also. I would recommend her to anyone not only for wedding cakes but for all events :)"}
{"text":"My now husband and I met Miss Lesley at The Windmill Winery's Bridal Open House in May 2016.   From our very brief interaction with her, we knew immediately that we would choose her (out of the two cake vendors available in the package from The Windmill Winery).   Lesley was super enthusiastic about what she could create for us - Not to mention, some of these cake flavors were ridiculous. As in, ridicu-licious!   Think Orange Dreamsicle, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Margarita. Yes, freaking Margarita! I adored the Peanut Butter Chocolate (the best flavor combination known to humankind, OMG), but that was a no-go for obvious reasons.   We reconnected with Lesley at an Open House in her actual location the month before our wedding for our cake consultation. Oh, and to sample some more cake flavors. *wink!*   One of Andrew C. and I's first dates was the midnight book release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - So we knew we had to incorporate this into our wedding day, with a CAKE.  Over her cup of Dutch Bros Coffee, Lesley didn't bat an eye at our nerdery when we told her this is what we wanted.   Folks, let me tell you, this cake was a Potterhead's DREAM. We haven't stopped talking about it, and neither have our friends and family!   Lesley carefully crafted:  1) Two Golden Snitches  2) A \"Mischief Managed\" banner as a nod to Fred and George Weasley's Marauder's Map 3) Harry Potter's Holly, Phoenix Feather Wand  4) The Elder Wand that Killed Lord Voldemort   Andrew and I provided the cake topper (Always with the Deathly Hollows).   Bottom Tier: Orange Dreamsicle with Buttercream  Middle Tier: Funfetti with Buttercream  Top Tier: Mint Chocolate Chip with Fudge   The entire process was stress-free.   The cake was delicious and worth the risk of diabetes should you go for broke on that 2nd slice.   We cannot wait to have our cake top tier recreated on our first anniversary. *drools!*   Whether it's your wedding, a birthday, baby shower; heck, maybe you just want to surprise someone with delicious treats - Lesley is your gal."}
{"text":"I needed a cake for my mom's 75th birthday party. I'm glad I found this place. I had a budget, but still wanted a beautiful and delicious cake. They worked with my budget. The cake was delicious. Everyone at the party loved it."}
{"text":"Lesley did such an amazing job. I came in with 3 or 4 pictures to explain the wedding cake I pictured in my mind and she did better than my vision. Such a sweet, down to earth person as well.  I would highly recommend her to anyone"}
{"text":"Lesley baked the cake for my husband and I for our wedding at the Windmill Winery. She was helpful in offering variety in the layers, to accommodate our tastes as well as dietary restrictions of some of our guests. Specifically, she was able to make the top tier of our cake gluten free lemon cake, which was amazing, and several of our friends who were gluten free noted that this was some of the best gluten free cake they'd had. A year later, Lesley offered to make a replica of our top tier for our first anniversary. She was punctual and accommodating to the availability of my schedule to pick up the cake. I would definitely use her again for birthdays or special occasions as the cake is moist and delicious, and not too overpowering with super sugary frosting."}
{"text":"1st off.... Best cake my family has likely ever had. I was looking for a custom cake place for my daughter's 15th birthday and came across Lesley's Creative Cakes. I emailed them explaining what I was looking for and they were quick, responsive and super friendly!  My daughter loves Dutch Bros and Lesley had the perfect cake for her birthday! This cake was a huge hit that EVERYONE loved. The cake itself was moist, the fillings were so yummy, and the buttercream was to die for. We will DEFINITELY be back for more cakes on any occasion."}
{"text":"Since this review , Lesley has contacted to make things clear the air. She's offered an anniversary cake for free in the missing margarita lime flavor . And has apologized for the other misunderstandings . I'm looking forward to enjoying the cake with my honey ."}
{"text":"My wife and I were married a the Windmill Winery, and Lesley's Creative Cakes provided our beautiful wedding cake. They provided a consultation that helped my Wife and I choose the right combination flavors for our wedding cake.  I highly recommend Lesley's to anyone looking for the perfect Wedding cake."}
{"text":"Lesley made us a gorgeous and delicious number cake for my mother-in-law's 70th birthday.  I am from CA and was in charge of ordering the cake. I searched on Yelp and contacted a few custom cake bakers but they could not make it exactly how I wanted.  I finally found Lesley's Creative Cakes and browsed through her website and felt confident that she would be able to make the cake.  I sent her an email with the photo of the number 70 cake. She responded quickly and confirmed that the cake design would not be a problem.  The day we picked up the cake, it was exactly what we expected and all of our guests were very impressed.  They loved it and could not stop talking about it.  It was a great ending to the party.  I'm happy that I found Lesley's Creative Cakes. My new go-to custom cake baker in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is the rudest establishment that I've ever encountered. I went to a cake tasting and not once did any staff member ever acknowledge my presence or ask if I needed help. I sat at my table alone as I watched them greet every person that came through the door, but not once did they even speak to me in this 8 table establishment. The final straw was when an old couple came in and she immediately asked if they needed help. I finally got up and walk out the door. As I was leaving she said  \"Do you have any questions, honey?\" I just said \"no\" and walked right past her. I refuse to be treated this way as a potential customer!!"}
{"text":"We recently used Lesley's Creative Cakes for our wedding cake. Our 3 tier cake was not only beautiful, but each layer was a different flavor and all delicious. The process of designing our cake was easy, and we got to pick exactly what we wanted. Thank you Lesley!"}
{"text":"Leslie made our wedding cake! It was beautiful and delicious. It came out exactly how we had imagined it (despite our inability to describe it!) We had a different flavors for each layer and many of our guests commented on going back to sample additional flavors! I couldn't recommend Leslie enough!!"}
{"text":"Christine Lesley's creative cakes & flowers I adore Christine! Honestly sitting with her and planning out my wedding flowers was one of the most fun wedding tasks I endured. She really loves what she does and it shows in her work. I know she had to have put a tone of effort into my order and she personally delivered them on my wedding day. She totally listened to what I was envisioning and made it come to life. Thank you soo much Christine!!!  Lesley's creative cakes So happy we chose Lesley's. The cake tastings are a blast. They have so many flavors and varieties to choose from but it really doesn't matter because everything is delicious. Ordering our wedding cake was fun and simple she was able to answer all our questions and concerns. We had a hard time saving the top piece for our anniversary because we couldn't stop eating the left overs!"}
{"text":"Lesley, is professional and a veteran. She made me SO at ease for my wedding and her prices you CAN'T beat for the quality. She laid it to us on what to expect and what would be best. I still dream about our wedding cake... We didn't save the topper but are planning to order a small replica on our anniversary. You can pay extra for delivery and set up, DO IT!"}
{"text":"I attended a free cake testing event with my cousin a few days ago. The: Chocolate with salted caramel-- very good Lemon with blueberries & custard-- very good  French vanilla with chocolate fudge- ok Banana with peanut butter- phenomenal ( the peanut butter was so smooth. I'm going to order a chocolate cake with peanut butter filling for my next party).  Lemon bars- too sweet   Wonderful staff and amazing cakes!!! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered a cake for my son's graduation back In May and was very disappointed . The Cale itself was dry and had no taste. I asked for custard filling with strawberries and there were just a few sliced strawberries in there ( needed a magnifying glass to see the strawberries) the frosting was so sweet . Overpriced for a terrible product . Will not use this location again!"}
{"text":"We have had two cakes from Lesley's now and they  both were great. One was the funfetti and the second was strawberry with custard. Both were delicious and beautifully decorated. We got so many compliments on the cake. I would definitely order from Lesley's again!"}
{"text":"I had Leslie make my sons cake for his 6th birthday, it was a two stack black and red Jason cake for Halloween theme party! I texted her a week before his party, I sent her the pictures on how I wanted it and she did such a great job!! I honestly think her cake that she made us was way better then the photos I sent her! We got so many compliments from our family and even random people were complimenting on how awesome the cake was! I might also add that the cake was delicious!! I had red velvet with cream cheese on the top and French vanilla with buttercream on the bottom, just perfect! THANK YOU LESLIE :)"}
{"text":"I am completely disgusted with the turn out of my cakes from Lesleys. I got married a year ago and my cake turned out horrible. It didn't turn out anything like she had promised and I paid extra for frosting flowers and got tacky plastic ones instead. she promised that I would get a much better anniversary cake and it turned out just as horrible. It brings up the memory of how i felt they day I saw my wedding cake."}
{"text":"If you need a cake made that will blow your mind with taste and looks. This is the right place! I have never seen such creativity for a cake until last night. The cake was amazing and tasted great. It was also delivered on time. For all your cake needs come here!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second year in a row that I've ordered my daughter's birthday cake from Lesley's and I am always extremely satisfied! Last year, it was a weirdly themed birthday and she nailed exactly what I wanted when I didn't even know what I wanted! Of course, they both tasted great as well.   We will continue to go to Lesley's for any of our specialty cake needs!"}
{"text":"Most amazing customer service along with amazing bakery skills. Lesley always takes the vision I have and exceeds it ! Highly recommend and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I went to Lesley with a photo of a cake my son was wanting for his birthday. I received a quick response and an extremely reasonable quote. When I went to pick up the cake I was blown away! Lesley did an absolutely fantastic job replicating the photo and the cake was delicious. My son could not have been more excited and it made his birthday party so special. I will be returning to Lesley for any future cake needs and I would recommend her to everyone!"}
{"text":"use Leslie's as gifts to my business clients. She's always done a fantastic job. Cakes are perfect condition. Always ready on time. She always follows up to make sure I'm happy with what I've gotten."}
{"text":"I recently celebrated my 25th birthday and couldn't decide if I wanted to do a cake or not. Lesley kept checking in to see if I had made a decision. So finally the day before I decided to go ahead and go forward with it. This woman has so much patience! My cake turned out beautiful! I've received so many compliments on how nice it looked! Not only did it look great but it was delicious :) the only downside was that in my excitement of how pretty the cake was I missed that the bow was the wrong color lol it was a minor detail and I was so in love with the cake that I didn't care!"}
{"text":"I tried a cake from lesley's for the first time today. One word. DELICIOUS!!! I can't wait for a reason to order one."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying the star rating I am giving to Lesley's Creative Cakes is based solely on the customer service experience I had with her over a several month timeframe while planning my wedding.  The cake tasted great, however I would NOT recommend her to brides in the future - you already have enough stress as it is, find a baker who will help in instead of add to the stress.  My husband and I got married at the Windmill Winery in Florence, AZ last April.  It's been awhile, and I've debated whether to write this review at all, as the rest of our wedding was absolutely amazing and the Windmill Winery is spectacular to their customers.  However I would have appreciated this feedback prior to making my decision a year ago.    When we locked in the Winery, part of the package (including food, music, etc.) was the cake.  Lesley's Creative Cakes was their sole vendor for this space, so there were no other options that weren't considered an 'upgrade'.  My husband and I had been to two open houses offered at the Windmill Winery, in which a few of the cake flavors available had been there to sample, and I liked the flavor, so I was fine with it.  When it came time to discuss the cake with Lesley, however, we hit a snag.  I reached out a few months before the wedding date, asking if we could meet for a tasting.  She informed me that they didn't offer tastings at her site, and that I would need to visit an open house at the Winery to try her cakes (along with the masses of other people taking bites of whatever sheet cakes Lesley had decided to bring that day).  We emailed back and forth, and I politely expressed that I had been to several open houses at this point, and that the Winery was much further away from my house (I live in Scottsdale) than her bakery, could she make an exception.  The answer was no, and I was told that if we told her what flavors we wanted to try, she would make them and bring them to the next open house.  Frustrated, but accepting that this is what we would need to do, my fiancé and I made the hour and a half trek to the Winery a third time, for the sole purpose of doing a cake tasting.  When we arrived and made it through the line at the cake table, we were informed (quite briskly) that we would only be allowed to sample two flavors, since so many people had come to the open house that had not RSVP'd, and they would need to reserve what they brought so it would last.  Surprised, I asked to speak to Lesley, as she was expecting us - turns out, the brisk lady who turned us down was Lesley.  I let her know I was the one who had been emailing her regarding the cake tasting, thinking she would say \"oh, no problem\" and accommodate us since we had specifically requested more than 4 cake flavors to taste.  Nope.  No sympathy, no customer service, just a \"sorry, we don't have enough\".    At this point, I was fed up, and spoke with our wedding coordinator at the Winery to see if there were other options.  She in turn spoke to her manager, who apparently had a conversation with Lesley regarding the situation.  The Winery offered us the option to use another bakery if we thought we couldn't make this work.  I let her know that I was still ok to use her (a mistake, in hindsight), I just wanted to be able to taste the cakes and have a consultation.  I reached out to Lesley one more time, and this time she said she could accommodate us at her bakery, so my fiancé and I went to Gilbert shortly after for our consultation.  She seemed nicer this time around, and definitely seemed knowledgeable about cakes - and the ones we tasted were great.  She also showed us pictures of previous cakes, and they all looked fantastic.  We discussed color (my color theme was a pale mint and pale peach color, with gold and coral accents) - and after showing her tons of pinterest pics of cakes I loved, we agreed on a cake with tiers in pale peach, pale mint, and small golden pearls as accents.  I was also getting coral roses from our florist that would be placed on the cake BY Lesley at the time of delivery at the Winery the day of the wedding.  With the details ironed out,  I left our meeting feeling much better.  Flash forward to our wedding day.  The cake was delivered to the Winery, but Lesley bailed immediately instead of staying to place the flowers on the cake, so my cousin had to decorate it.  AND if that weren't enough, my 'pale' peach and mint cake looked like something radioactive.  Bright Orangey and Limey tiers that would have glowed in the dark.  My husband and I laugh about it at this point, because it was so ridiculous, and really not a big deal in the GRAND scheme of things.  But brides beware - I am not even a cake person (my husband is), but if you dream of having the most perfect cake on your wedding day, go here with caution."}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes made our wedding cake last year, and it came out perfectly. We had about 100 guests, and they worked with us to stay in budget. We got a 3-tier cake with an extra sheet cake, and they let us pick a separate flavor on each tier! It transported well, and came out amazing in pictures!"}
{"text":"Lesley's creative cakes has to be one of the best, most affordable, cake decorators in the Valley.  I tried a couple of other places and the cakes were either \"airy\" and too light with little flavor or overpriced and charged for the extra details etc.  Lesley had one price for her cakes and agreed that she could do exactly what I wanted. She emailed me back promptly and sent me photos of similar cakes, was very patient and detail oriented and even called me a week before the wedding just to be sure all of the details were correct and in sync. (cake arrive on time- color of the base-- flowers for extra accent) etc.  She also made an amazing grooms cake that was exactly what I wanted and tasted amazing!! I couldn't rave about them enough.  Will be ordering all of my cakes for every occasion from Lesley."}
{"text":"I found this bakery while searching yelp for my goddaughter's first birthday cake.  Her mom and I wanted to get a Minnie Mouse cake with a matching smash cake. I saw a similar Minnie Mouse cake in the gallery and reached out to Lesley's for information, and I'm so glad I chose them!  They responded quickly to all of my emails, were reasonably priced for great quality, and perfectly captured the visions we had for my goddaughter's cakes! Not only did the cakes come out beautifully, they tasted even better! (I ordered red velvet with a strawberry banana filling.)  My ONLY suggestion is that I wish there was a bit larger of a plate/base under the cake.  The two tier cake was pretty heavy, and we struggled a bit to move it from the box to the cake stand. But overall,  everything was exceptional!   Thank you, Lesley's, for helping make my goddaughter's first birthday extra sweet! I highly recommend this bakery if you need a custom cake for a special event! We will definitely be back for more cakes in the future!"}
{"text":"Lesley's Creative Cakes provided the cake and mini cupcakes for my wedding. Their flavors were amazing and everyone loved them! They were so pleasant to work with, very organized, timely, and just all around great! Not to mention, everything was soooo delicious! I'd highly recommend them for weddings but also parties or special occasions!"}
{"text":"She could care less if you are happy with your product or not! So unprofessional. I ordered 40 cupcakes, we emailed pictures and I have in writing the design I approved. Not what I got. There were supposed to be green leaves on white flowers, not one cupcake had a leaf and flowers looked like frosting blobs. Baked with over pour, flowers off center, at least half of them were very dry and got thrown away. When I emailed her about it she didn't seem to care at all, why should she shed already been over paid for a low quality product. She offered a discount on my next order, which was ridiculous because obviously I'd never use her again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful cake for my daughters 7th birthday. The flavor was great but the price was steep and after sitting for about 15min after cutting it fell over. The cake was very moist!   Ordering cake was easy as well as leaving a deposit. Cake was ready for pickup on time. I would definitely order another cake for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"They were so great and were able to give us exactly what we wanted, no questions asked. Working with them was honestly the most simple part of our wedding planning experience."}
{"text":"We ordered a gender reveal cake from Lesley's. We were originally going to do something low key but my bestie said since it was our first we should go all out. We decided to get a custom cake about 10 days before the party. I messaged 4 bakeries. Two were unable to do it on short notice and the third was more expensive than Lesley's, so we went with her.   Everything started off well. Lesley was nice and responded to emails to promptly, which I really appreciate. We ended up dropping the gender envelope (neither of us knew the gender) off a day late and she didn't have a problem with it.   The cake we ordered, as you can see from the pics, was supposed to be square not rectangular. It's based off the cube in Mario Bros. I was a bit disappointed since the cake wasn't cheap, but it was still cute.   The real problem came when we cut into the cake. About an inch of frosting on the outside was white and the inside was such a pale pink we had to go and get the envelope to double check. I guess I had really high expectations, since this is our first and it was supposed to be so special. We were just supposed to cut into it and see the brightly colored pink or blue frosting and be celebrating along with our friends and family. Instead we were scrambling to cut further into the cake and figure out what color it was. If you look closely at the middle of cake you can see the pink but everything looked white to the people watching on FB live and standing on the far edge of my kitchen. It just really put a damper on the whole experience.   The cake itself was good, everyone seemed to like it but it was too sweet for me. My definition of white cake is apparently different from theirs, because the cake was yellow and very dense, rather than white and fluffy.   Based on the reviews I'm sure if you went with one of their other cakes you'd be happy, but I can't recommend them for gender reveals."}
{"text":"Lesley's creative cakes is phenomenal. I called on a Monday needing a detailedThey called me back right away and were able to accommodate my request.. And they knocked it out of the park. The custom unicorn cake was the hit of the party!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got married June 8, 2017 at The Windmill Winery.. Lesley's creative cakes did an amazing job on our wedding cupcakes and cake!! They looked amazing and beautiful for the special day and tasted even better!! I also used her for my bridal shower cupcakes and they tasted just as amazing as any other time! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an amazing cake for any occasion! Thanks for making our day even better with an amazing cake!"}
{"text":"We used Lesley for our wedding cake. When we went to a vendor meeting at our venue The Falls Event Center. They had many different types of cakes to sample and we loved all of them. They took the time to talk with us about what we wanted and the design we were looking for.   The cake looked beautiful and was designed better than I could have imagined. It showed they took great care with placing each cherry blossom and petal on the cake making it look wonderful. We did have a few hiccups with the order but nothing that would ruin our day. All the guests loved the cake and cupcakes."}
