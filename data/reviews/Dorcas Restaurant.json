{"text":"I don't know why, but when I feel like getting Korean to go, I come to Dorca's instead of Woori Jib.  It is a little more expensive than what you would find outside of Champaign, but that doesn't stop me from frequenting this place.    You get very sizeable portions.  I always get their bbq chicken (bulgolgi's also very good, but I'm a white-meat eater) and it comes with a shitload of rice, side of kimchi, a few potstickers, some rice noodles... basically enough food to last me two to three meals.  If you don't carry out, you get free refills on soup and rice.  Great, great food and fast service.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Dorcas is a very standard Korean restaurant... that Koreans actually go to! The portions are substantial, soups authentic, and banchan wonderfully served. This place reminds me of cafeterias back in Seoul, and not necessary all in a good way. The interior is clearly not meant for show, and while you know what? It makes the food stand out even better!"}
{"text":"It's funny how the nice new couple at church kept asking me how school was whenever they'd see my ILLINOIS sweatshirt after church. I just thought they were very friendly and brushed it off. After all, we're in the North Shore after all? Turned out, they own this place and drive up every Sunday for church. Insane people!  I used to come here during high school trips on weekends to see the boyfriend and now more often that I'm visiting the school again so I can finish up a lousy bachelor's. Still the same food, still the same portions and the homey feeling of an unpretentious restaurant.   I love the duk gook. I'll never eat it at home but when they see me in the restaurant, it's always a pat on the head and a \"How's school?\" I do love to support local business but this is getting really close to home.  Combos are a good idea for newbies to the Korean food world but kalbi and bulgogi are awesome choices if you're diving headfirst by yourself. Remember though, they're closed on Sundays. That's how we Koreans roll..."}
{"text":"We ate here last night for dinner and it was pretty excellent.  My fiance had a generous portion of jib jae with pot stickers (aka Combo II), while I had a kim chi and beef soup.  His beef was beautifully flavored but the jib jae had very few vegetables (not that they are a requirement, but I tend to find that entree very greasy otherwise).  My kim chi soup was very good, although I thought the amount of tofu in addition to the beef was overkill.  My only issue was with the sides and soup that comes with the meal: my turnip kim chi tasted like perfume for some reason, and the soup was pretty blah in comparison with the soup supplied at Ar-ri-rong.  All in all, I think Dorcas is a really good place to get Korean food.  It's fast and the entrees that we tried are excellent."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for Korean food out of all the places on campus.  They have good combos.. they come with lots of food!  They also have free soup that you can sip on while you wait.  This is good since the wait might be a little long if you come during their busy lunch hour though.  I think they have good kalbi in noodles and soup.  I get that a lot.  I have also tried their dumplings and bulgogi.. all very good.  If you had once place to go on campus for Korean.. I would strongly urge you to go here."}
{"text":"Dorcas is one of the best Korean restaurant in CU in my opinion. I love their combos because I always get to try different dishes. My favorite is their grilled mackerel. They give you tonnes of food as you can see from the pictures. The taste is not bad but they need to add more variety to their menu.  Update: I retract my last statement. I went there again this weekend and their menu has a lot to choose from. The hot and spicy squid was really good."}
{"text":"Cheap. Good Korean food. Friendly mom and pop. Great soup."}
