{"text":"I'm reading the reviews for this place and started wondering did I go to the same place these people are talking about?? They must be related to the owner or they wouldn't give shawarma Vegas 4+ please. First this place needs some deep major cleaning and a better system for taking orders, the cashier was talking on the phone and when she was done she took our order and at the same breath she started talking to one of her friends that happened to be there. Would I go back absolutely NOT"}
{"text":"Great place if they were ever open! Website and employees say that they are Sunday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. but this is not the case at all. They never answer the phone and they are never open. I am curious as to how much business they have lost due to this. All this could be avoided if they actually post the correct business hours or answer their phone. Such a shame because the food is great (when you can actually get it)!"}
{"text":"Horrible service do not go got there at 7 and the guy said his closing on the sign it said 10.  I told him can I get something to go I just came from newyork. His like yelling closed I was like u kidding with a smirk he replies does it look like I'm joking. Horrible service do not go!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Israeli food very nice people
Who work here I really love this place I came here with my whole family all my cousins and all my siblings and it came out to 20 people and they treated us amazingly very nice people I would recommended this restaurant"}
{"text":"I like the food here , this is my to go place for shawerma,small place but nice atmosphere and good service"}
{"text":"This place is probably the best shawarma you can get in vegas. I loved how authentic it was and the variety of toppings that you can put on it. The shawarma itself was wonderfully cooked with what I think was lamb fat to add just the right amount of gaminess to the dish. It reminded me of what of real shawarma taste like. 
Definitely will be back."}

food very tasty I eat the steak and it's so good.. 
Glatt kosher"}
{"text":"The best Kosher food in Vegas!
We love coming here. 
Moshe is the best!
Grate salads great Rib Eye and beef kebobs"}
{"text":"Had the best falafal here a couple of months ago. Came back for the falafal and was told they didn't have any. Came back again a week later and still no falafal without any explanation why or if they will ever have any again. Unfriendly, rude...will not be back."}
{"text":"Been eating at this place the last few times I came to Las Vegas, this place has really great food and very reasonable prices.

Moshe, the owner of this place is the funniest person you will ever meet. He will throw in extra stuff randomly such as falafel and chips at no extra cost.

I personally recommend a falafel plate and a lafa with shawarma with Israeli salad but you really can't go wrong with any dish on the menu"}
{"text":"Well if you're looking for bad service then step right up and take a crack at this place. I wish that I could comment on the food but they didn't even make it that far until I was out the door due to the lousy service.

So I walked into the place in the evening many hours before they close and there are two tables of customers, both with their food, and they're not busy at all. I walked up to the counter and had the two cooks and the host taking the order walking around for awhile stocking food and things. I stand there for probably 5 minutes waiting for someone to come. They seem to be in no rush. The place isn't busy so what's the hurry.

Finally the guy comes up and takes my order. I ask a couple quick questions about the menu and then I place my order. He asks me if I want fries, I say sure.

I go over and sit down at a table right next to the front. I patiently wait. (3 mins, 5 mins, 7 mins.....) No food. All while this is happening the host/cashier is walking around stocking food and things in the back. Coming out to the front and refilling the drinks. Stocking the condiments, etc. 

Finally after 10 minutes another customer walks in the door and places an order. 5 minutes later and the customer gets HIS food! Well this immediately made me heated. The host/cashier comes out again and walks by me for probably the 7th time stocking things and cleaning up the tables. My level of irritation is growing more and more. Finally after about 15 minutes really politely I stop the guy and ask, \"Is my meal almost ready?\". His confused response, \"Oh did you place an order?\". My jaw kinda drops, \"Ummm I was JUST at your counter 15 mins ago and have been sitting here waiting.\". Finally it dawns on him, \"Omigosh! I totally forgot that you ordered! Soooo what did you have again?\".

I'm just frankly shocked. I stand up and say, \"Don't worry about it. I'm out of here.\". He follows me out the front door and says, \"I'm sorry sir, I just forgot.\". I say, \"I can understand if you're busy to forget but you guys aren't whatsoever. That's just really bad service.\". He says he will give me the food free. I decline again.

I just can't understand how a person forgets an order he JUST placed. Nobody new comes in. He walks by you 7 times while you're sitting at the table with no food patiently waiting. And you actually have to stop HIM to get him to realize."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! 
I had falafel, mashed potatoes and salads and everything was delicious and fresh. Best Mediterranean food I had in Vegas
Highly recommended
While here, check out their next door shop"}
{"text":"While Vegas(and Henderson) posses several \"Jewish Deli\" establishments that serve New York style ashkenazi cuisine that everyone knows and loves, the city was severely lacking any good middle eastern/Israeli/ establishments ( especially considering the sizable minority that seem to work through out the strip and oddly enough at many of the local mall carts) that cater to Sephardic cuisine. There is a good Afghan kabob (or is it kabeb? i forget) spot on the east side and i've heard rumors of a good Persian spot as well, but most other Mediterranean /mid east joints were poor attempts at Americanized greek.I'm getting off topic; we're here to talk about Shawarma Vegas. 

This place is a hole in the wall as someone else mentioned; but in a good way. There maybe no more than 5 or 6 tables inside and a couple more outside. What it lacks in size and decor, it makes up in food. I have been twice and so far both meals were a success. 
The Shawarma in pita was excellent (and I still feel that is an understatement.)that was stuffed with the usual condiments of hummus and pickles amongst others. I am truly looking forward to trying the entire Shawarma plate. The schnitzel was fried perfectly, with the chicken far from dry (always an issue with schnitzel). Nearly as good as my Grandmothers! 

The food is a bit pricey, but most kosher meats usually run on the higher end so I can accept it. (plus the food is great) 

A great place for middle eastern comfort food."}
{"text":"Native of LA.. I'm a huge fan of Pita kitchen and zankou chicken.. Since moving to LV.. I ve really missed good shawarma.. But I think I found my new favorite spot!
The food is fresh and delicious!! The shawarma has great flavor, tender, and juicy.. Pita is good too a lil' chewy just the way I like it.. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Found this place through a Yelp search. I had the shawarma pita. It was delicious! The staff was friendly and helpful. A little taste of the Middle East on Ft. Apache and Charleston."}
{"text":"Came here last week looking for some decent shawarma. It was definitely not found at this establishment. I ordered chicken shawarma from a woman who wasn't friendly at all and rude at best. Didn't smile or say hello when I ordered. In fact, I had to initiate the conversation for the order. After I ordered and paid, not even a thank you. No response at all. 

The chicken shawarma I had was bland and there weren't even many pieces of chicken. Completely disappointed especially with how pricey it was. I have no idea why this place has so many good reviews. I will definitely not be back. A waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. 
Good prices with big plates and yummy food..
Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"The food was soo good. We came here for my cousin's birthday, and even though the place is small, they were able to quickly accomodate our large party. I had the falafel sandwich and added the all-you-can-eat salad option. I was anxious to try all the salads, but I never got past the first two that I ordered because they give you such large portions. I was expecting a small little dollop of each salad, but instead they loaded on the salads onto individual plates, so I had a hard time finishing them. I had the baba ganoush and the Moroccan salad. They were both very delicious, but the Moroccan salad was probably my favorite, though it was very spicy. The red cabbage salad and Israeli salad were also excellent additions to my falafel sandwich. My husband, who is not the biggest fan of Mediterranean food, really enjoyed his shawarma and the beef & veggie soup (sorry, didn't catch the name) that he ordered. Oh yeah, the pita bread was also outstanding, nice and soft, not thin and too chewy like at some other places."}
{"text":"Been three and Got a few shawarma to go  without tasting it , it was the the biggest mistake, meat was disgusting and  uncooked really the worst I ever had , and I been to many authentic middle eastern Shawarma Israeli style , the place is  glatt kosher so the meat is smooth ! IWas thinking I will  get the Israeli flavor , but at the end got really uncooked disgusting Shawarma

All in General

Service so not friendly  
Food uncooked and missing flavor (only shawarma )"}

Lots of yami fresh salads, the pita here is so good  .

If you love Israeli food this is the place to go!!"}

Staff was very friendly.

Food was excellent. Shawarma was huge!


Only downfall, staff was yelling at each other in Hebrew the whole time - but this is what made it feel authentic!

Oh - and it is Kosher, if that is important to you."}
{"text":"What a grate home style cooking place. Feeling spoiled, round and happy!!!
So many salads on the table, grate fast service, loved it, coming back soon"}
{"text":"This place used to be a little \"hole in the wall\" with poor décor but incredibly good food. It's been redecorated a year ago and looks better now, but let's face it - we don't go there for the ambiance. We go there for the great food.
Food is always fresh, delicious, healthy and very authentic. Lots of Israelis eat there - proof of it's authenticity cause they know what tastes like the real deal and what is a \"watered down\" version. We love practically everything on the menu that we've tried.
Best Shawarma in Vegas for sure. They make it the traditional way, no shortcuts or cheating.
The array of salads and small plates that they bombard your table with as soon as you sit down can be a meal in itself. Served with wonderful fluffy warm Pita bread,It's hard not to get full before you actual entrée gets there. 
The Falafel is excellent. Too many middle eastern places these days serve Falafel made from rehydrated powder, but theirs is the real deal!
Besides all the regular middle eastern fair you get there, you should always ask what they have \"cooked\" or \"off the menu\" today. There is almost always some cooked dish that's very much like something an Israeli or Arab grandmother and mother used to cook at home. Those dishes are not on the menu, and change daily, so be sure to ask about them.
The owner is an Israeli guy who is always very friendly, welcomes everyone as if they just walked into his own home. He cared deeply about your satisfaction and will do all he can to make sure you leave full and HAPPY. 
Your kids are guaranteed to adore the Israeli Schnitzel - A food most Israeli kids eat almost weekly. 
Tip - Ask them to \"dress\" the Israeli salad, it makes a huge difference.
If you are on a budget or just want to grab something quick on the go, order one of their Pita, Laffa or Baguette sandwiches. They'll custom stuff it to your hearts' content. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I finally found a GREAT place for shwarma since I left Seattle! So good, tender, juicy meat, and the best hummus and white yogurty cucumber (I think that's what it is) sauce! I will increase my star scoring as I try more items on the menu! Btw, Joe at the register was not only friendly but helpful and reassuring that I was about to have the best Shwarma since my trip to Sint Maarten."}
{"text":"New management in place, food is good,  place is clean and looks good and now with good prices you should come and try their food
Best if luck shawarma vegas"}
{"text":"Solid for shawarma. Staff can be a little brusque, but it's the only place out of the Bay area to get a good stuffed pita that isn't an Americanized wrap or made with store-bought bread. Ask for it with everything, but beware it includes spicy sauce that overpowers at times. 

As stated in Sheila's review, the chicken itself is a bit of a mystery- can't tell if it's dark meat or white meat, it's flavorful but a bit on the odd side and I can't place my finger on why. 

If shawarma ain't your thing, menu includes a lot of options, including falafel, schnitzel, and $3 AYCE salads, as well as plates."}
{"text":"The worst customer service. Rude owners. Food was delivered cold. No paper utensils . When we called to complain they said that we should get it in the hotel????!!!!! \"Kosher\"? They are a joke!!!!
Food salty , cold , \"Israeli salad \" cut up cucumbers and tomatoes , no lemon no olive oil No taste. Better look for real kosher place.
Skip this one!!!!!!!!!
This is the first time I have to write a bad review on Yelp"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The best shawarma in Vegas. Friendly ppl work there and we always get more food then what we need to get. If you looking for Israeli food this is the place for you"}
{"text":"This place never lets me down. They easily have the best middle eastern food in Las Vegas. Everything there is made with care and is super authentic. My boyfriend and I always get the laffa sandwiches with either their shawarma or falafels. Everything is made from scratch and you get to tell them what to put in your laffa sandwich. There are varieties of sauces, pickled cabbages, corn with dill, baba ghanoush, and hummus. Everything is house made and kosher. I usually get everything in my laffa sandwich because it is all so damn good. I always end up so full after eating here. These guys hook it up! I've been going here for three years now and I will continue to do so. This is one of my favorite spots in Vegas."}

The food is always freshly made & sure to please people who have been raised on authentic Lebanese or other Mediterranean foodies;)"}
{"text":"Get the shawarma on laffa bread. It is a way tastier carb than pita in my opinion! It's super chewy, soft, and soaks up all the sauces and juices really well. There were a few complaints on yelp regarding the price (approx. $11/shawarma) but if you think about it, all the sauces are home made, the meat is kosher, veggies are fresh, 2 people can definitely share one, and you are contributing to a local joint! This is my ultimate favorite shawarma joint in the USA. Next time I'm going to ask them to add fries! Woohoo!"}
{"text":"The best kosher shawarma in Las Vegas !
Wow wow and wow !!! 
Highly recommended place ! 
Really good prices!

Clean place !
Definitely will come back to eat again ...
If u have car don't missed this place ...
It Worth to drive it's only 15 min from the strip but u will thank me after u will eat in this place . 
The shawarma is really tasty ! We also eat the schnitzel and it was yamyyyy 
The place very clean very organized and salads are really fresh ... 
the have variety of meals to choose.

Thank u moshe for great meal it was the delicious!"}
{"text":"Food is still amazing, and when Moshe is there the service is great. At times I still feel like an outsider, even though I'm Jewish and Kosher. I don't speak hebrew very well. 

But the shawarma is amazing, as are the beef kabobs. Hummus, and other salads are all home made and authentic. If you're getting a sandwich, I recommend Lafa bread, for a wrap.  

Decor is very basic, but the food is A+ and not to be missed."}
{"text":"Me and my husband visited las vegas from LA he lookup this place and he says let's give it a try, 
great customer service great food, hummus is amazing and that food so fresh everything  from scratch good price if you are in Vegas this is the place I really recommend this place authentic"}
{"text":"oooooommmmmgggg.  This place is DELISH!  And, from the looks of it (middle eastern people eating there) it's legit!  We had shawarma Pita and Jerusalem Chicken plate with rice and side of Falafel and all the delicious salads.  The head guy in charge - no idea what his name is - he was super attentive and kind and funny.  The Babaganoush was garlic-y and delish.  All the salads and the hummus were bomb.  The pita was chewy and warm and tasty.  I will definitely be back!  Super good.  Very family feeling.  The place itself is nothing to look at but it's worth it for the food and service. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Only been here a few times and each time does not disappoint! I always get the shawarma in a pita with everything on it!  So delicous and recommended to all!"}
{"text":"The shawarma is probably the best in town.
lost one star for being ridiculously expensive! ($14 for shawarma sandwich).
and the other star was lost for shitty service and cleanliness (or lack of it)."}
{"text":"The food is great! It's the service that needs desperate attention.

ATTENTION OWNERS: We are not in Jerusalem. We are not in Tel Aviv. While I understand the laid back, casual, time consuming approach other cultures have,  I assure you most people will not. Neither will they yelp about it in an attempt to help you understand. They simply will not return.

You need to greet customers promptly, prepare the food in a reasonable time, and smile.  

Every time I am in your restaurant is a new adventure. There is ZERO consistency. Sometimes your service is ok, but most times it is plain aweful. What a shame, considering how delicious your food truly is.

Please fix your customer service problems so I can enjoy my experience, and find you open rather than out of business when I return. Shalom."}
{"text":"AMAZING Food, fresh and maid by request.
The service is outstanding 
Thank you moshe shawarma"}

Ambience : Israeli music playing in the background

I just tried kosher food for the first time Xclusive KOSHER in Las Vegas at this little gem of a restaurant.... I met with the owner and I got a table full of goodies to try !!!...
Here's my review :
We got about 8 small plates
Cabbage 
Cooked onions with tomatoes
An airy yet flavorful cucumber salad which I was told called israel salad 
Shawarma is chicken very tender 
Hummus 
Kabub -ground beef like with hummus 
LAFA is bread hot out the oven 

The cook did an excellent job!!!"}

Izik was the best , we felt like he really cared about us. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Most succulent chicken I have ever had.  There is minimal seating but the food is so fresh. Prices reflect freshness of the meats"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty, but I feel like it is a little bit of a rip off. I learnt my lesson. Get the sandwiches they are more worth the money versus the plates. Go to Jerusalem Grill, they are the better kosher spot in town."}
{"text":"wow wow wow wow wow wow !!!!!
by far the best food in town for any occasion !!!! 
best middle eastern food!!
best served!!!
neat and clean !!!!
they make hummus right here and it is amazing!!!!!! 
you have to order a steak on a skewer by far - best!! 
finally- a kosher place in las vegas that deserves all the respect!! 
damn!!!!!"}
{"text":"You know that feeling you get when you see a really beautiful person in passing and you can't stop thinking about them all day? Well that is how I felt about my Falafel Pita Sandwich from Shawarma Vegas. WOAH it was awesome. 

This place is kind of hidden, I almost couldn't find it (it is inconspicuously nestled next to a taco shop behind the gas station). Upon walking in and checking out the menu, my first thought was that it was kind of expensive. However, once I took my first bite the price was well justified because it is probably the best falafel I have ever eaten (and I've had a lot of falafel). 

With the pita sandwich, you have the option to fill it with a variety of toppings so I got hummus, cucumber tomato salad, pickled cabbage, chili sauce, and some tahini. I can't wait to come back to this place, I'd 100% recommend it to anyone looking for some great Mediterranean food on the west side!"}
{"text":"Not open. Yelp and Google say this place is open now. Drove all the way over here and it's closed."}
{"text":"Hummus is made on site and 9 times out of 10 on point, which is difficult to do outside of Jerusalem. Shawarma is decent. Falafel is okay. The owner is very friendly. Overall 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"What a great place 
Love Israeli food. 
Clean and kosher food
My own opinion the best In town"}
{"text":"The place is a little pricier than other shawarma places, and I can't say I'm a fan of the decour either, but the food here was amazing!

We came for the shawarma, and the place delivered! I got a shawarma pita with hummus and tahini, cabbage, some red hot sauce and some onions. The pita was stuffed full of delicious shawarma and all of the fixins. I couldn't even finish the whole pita because it was so big! The combination of the shawarma and the tahini tasted so good. 

I love how everything is handmade over there from the pita to the hummus. In the background, you can see the chefs cutting the juicy strips of meat for the shawarma. Everyone their was really nice as well. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously Peeps....This place is the REAL DEAL! Once again proving the best place for locals are the kooky little places, tucked in the back of some random shopping mall. Here is no exception!

This place is legit! Homemade pitas good! The owner clearly has so much pride in what he is serving. You feel the foodlicious love!

We ordered a shwarma plate that was giant! and amazingly delicious, and 3 shwarma pita wraps with the works for the gang. Every bite amazing!

So happy to have discovered this little place!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars to an establishment, this place would be at the top of my list.  My awful experience went as follows:

I was in Vegas on 6/1/12 and had a craving for shawarma.  I Yelped some nearby shawarma places and decided on Shawarma Vegas due to its close proximity and the good reviews that it had gotten despite its somewhat pricey menu.  I noticed on Yelp that it closes at 4pm on Fridays, but it was only 3:05 so I figured I was in the clear.  

I walked in and saw a woman behind the counter frantically scooping some food.  No greeting, hello, eye contact, nor nod of acknowledgement of my presence.  I began looking at the menu overhead to decide what I wanted.  The woman then says to me in a raised voice (for no apparent reason because there was no music or any other customers to talk over) , \"WE'RE CLOSED.  WHAT YOU WANT?\"  I was a little startled by her greeting and also surprised that they were already closed considering that it said on Yelp that they close at 4pm on Fridays and that it said on Shawarma Vegas's website that they're open from 9-9, Mon-Fri (confusing I know).  Surprised by the fact that she said that they were closed, I replied, \"Oh, you're closed?\"  Her reply to me (in an even more irritated tone) again was, \"WHAT YOU WANT?\"  Appalled by her sheer rudeness, I calmly responded with \"Nothing from here.\", turned around and walked right out the door.  I had never been so rudely treated at an establishment where I was a hungry patron willing to pay $11.99 for supposed good chicken shawarma in pita bread.

I see the reviews on Yelp where fellow reviewers talk about the great and \"friendly\" customer service from this place.  It's gotta be a joke.  I seriously don't know where to begin to explain how upset I was at the treatment that I received.  Needless to say, I will never come here again the next time that I'm in Vegas and will adamantly discourage any and all Vegas friends from patronizing this establishment."}
{"text":"A bit of a drive from the strip but if you want good kosher shawarma stop by here it's worth the drive. Small place but The service was great  and the food was also delicious."}
{"text":"Food was good, small place. The manager kept making personal calls right at the register which was a little strange, but the food was fantastic. I ordered 2 shawarma (one pita, one baguette) and both were amazing. Worth a visit"}
{"text":"It's authentic food!!! I can completely tell the flavor difference from other Mediterranean restaurants I have dined in CA.  

The falafels are perfect!  They weren't dry or over fried.  I've never had Falafel inside a pita with tahini and hummus plus the fixins.  I love the pickled vegetables especially with the Moroccan green chili, similar to Jalapenos.

The hummus is so creamy, made fresh, with pure olive oil... I'm ashamed I've been buying the ones in tubs.  I want to eat their hummus with everything: salad, omelette, fish, chicken and together with their pickled vegetables.  My lunch was beyond delicious!

It was my first time trying imported grape juice too.  WOW!  Forget grape soda - we don't need that anyway.  I don't think a bottle of that grape juice was even enough, I wanted another.  You ever had the thought when you drink the last sip and you're like - \"darn!\"

First visit, five stars... healthy food, authentic, beyond delicious, easy to order, clean tables & seating, affordable meals.  Yes I'm eating here again, no doubt!"}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food ever. You buy one plate and get so many sides and big quantity each plate that even 2 people can't finish , very very very tasty , it became my first priority restaurant in Vegas.. Love it! Very recommended"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night to see what the fuss is about, however we never got to experience the food that everyone is raving about on the Yelp reviews.   The restaurant was packed with several Jewish patrons. Upon walking in, we were informed that they had run out of food.  We just shrugged it off, and went to the taco shop next door. While walking back to our car, we noticed more Jewish customers at the counter ordering food!!!  I can't help but feel that we were denied service because we did not appear to be Israeli or Jewish."}
{"text":"My second time at this place very good experience.food is great Moshe the owner is the funniest and love to spoil. Going to enjoy their freshly squeezed orange juice with the best shawarma in town. Definitely recommend their shawarma is a must!!!"}
{"text":"I walked into this small post near the corner of Ft. Apache and Sahara and a guy talking on his phone sitting at one of the tables got up and offered me a menu. I'm guessing he might be the owner? The same dude took my order. You get your money's worth in quantity here. The falafel platter was huge! I walked out of there with two styrofoam containers full of stuff. The first was a baker's dozen of small falafel and rice. In the second they give you your choice of salads and sides. The guy didn't bother explaining how many the meal came with or if there was a limit. He just filled up the container as I pointed to three things, none of which were exceptional. The cucumber salad was bland, the hummus was thick and paste-like, and the red cabbage -- the best of the bunch -- had a hint of sweetness. Even the falafel weren't particularly memorable, except for a pronounced aftertaste that I quickly drowned out with beer when eating at home. I may have walked out with several pounds of food, but less than half was eaten."}
{"text":"First time I had falafel was at Tacos & Tequila.  It was no bueno.  I know what you are thinking...Falafel at TNT..WTH!?!  Then the second time I had it was at Greek Bistro.  It wasn't delicious as I had hoped for.  After a discussion with my Israeli co-worker, she recommended Shawarma Vegas.  

The way she described it got me salivating, so I had to try it out.  

So I ordered the falafel, and my friend ordered the Chicken Shawarma.
 
As we are waiting for our food, the nice lady brought out small plates of the following:
-Israeli salad: chopped & seasoned cucumber and tomato:  Refreshing
-baba ganoush:  Yummy
-hummus:  Yum
-red cabbage salad:  Eehh
-mini pitas:  piping hot, crisp on the outside, soft in the inside.  Perfect.

 Wow, those small plates were all bursting with bold flavor, exciting my palate!  The owner was super nice, saying that other restaurants may want customers to spend more money on appetizers, but not here..customers get small plates of appetizers for free,  not spending anymore money.  

However, I wasn't too excited about my falafel or the shawarma.  The shawarma has morrocan spices, but it tasted like it needs some salt or a bit of BAM.  Dunno, I can't make a comparison to anything else since this is my first time having the shawarma.  The texture was unexpected as well.  

As for my much anticipated falafel...I came to the conclusion that...ummm..I don't like falafel.

Can't really hold that against them can I.  But regardless, I will come back to try other items and get my small plates of delicious appetizers.

This is  more of a 3.5 star small eatery in my book."}
{"text":"The best shawarama in las Vegas !!!!

Fresh and good service like in israel"}
{"text":"Kosher. Not classy for sure. We're from LA so we are spoiled.  The salads were good. Chicken plate was also good. No diet drinks available."}
{"text":"This is a great place for meat lovers. My bf enjoyed the shawarma and shznitzel here. But as a vegetarian i didnt have many options. I wasnt in the mood for falafel but it was my only choice. The falafal is decent, not bad. The israeli salad here is AMAZING!!! so so good and lemony and as it should be. Very fresh. The fries here are really good too. They are fresh and they leave the skin on which i love. The employees are friendly. Wish they had a more varied menu though. Wish i would have had their salad once more before i left vegas"}
{"text":"Best kosher restaurant in vegas. I always order the Jerusalem mix laffa, which has shwarma mixed with fried onions. The service is nice, they are very welcoming. The food is consistantly good and flaverful."}
{"text":"We are always looking for schawarma... I should say good schawarma -- it is hard to find... unless we make it ourselves... however, Shawarma Vegas was not bad at all!

What can I tell you... they are a little whole in the wall deli type place and you can find them in a little strip mall & as I looked around - it appears that the 'area' (very small) might cater to Jewish businesses... anyways, if you do not slow down you might miss it.  I forgot to mention to the owner that some signs / advertisement might behoove him.  Inside, you are welcome to wash your hands before eating (which, I like) and it appears that it may also be a low key hangout where you might find yourself picking up the Torah to read whilst you munch on their yummy eats.

We had:

Geo: Shawarma pita w french fries and babaganoush and hummus
Moi:  Kabob plate w Israeli salad (mixture of tomatoes & cucumbers in vinaigrette sauce & hummus w tea...

Not bad at all... I thought that since the kabobs were so juicy that perhaps they may have been a little oily - Geo, says, 'not so' all in all the taste was very good.

If we are in the area again - we will go - I would not, however, drive all the way there just to eat schwarma...

still good all in all...

your constant companion,

{"text":"We enjoyed to eat it there restaurant very good food very good service.
We been eating over there for very long time.
Love it best shuarma and laffa
Keep up guys!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Great service and a great Israeli feed for when you're craving authentic food. 

They give you 5-6 salads with your meal which that along could feed you, and then their portions are very generous. Check them out, it's good and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best  mediterranean food in Vegas hands down.. No questions ask- plus every dish is big & filling .. Love to eat here when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Checked this place tonight and it was closed. Either they're closed or they have inconsistent hours."}
{"text":"A nice neighborhood hole in the wall with a homey feel.  Tasted like a home cooked meal.  Not used to the rice with bean sauce but I liked the chicken a lot.  Wish they had a bigger beverage menu."}
{"text":"$18 for a shawarma plate. Lost a potential loyal customer over high priced food. Not trying to be an asshole I just feel they should know. They must have the demand to be charging that much. It was busy. Good for them. Foods good no complaints there. Just too much money for what it is"}
{"text":"Great place. Good atmosphere and friendly people. Good food especially the hummus."}
{"text":"I spotted this little restaurant on the way out of town and decided to drop in and pick up some food for the trip ahead. I was very glad I did.

The menu is typical mediterranean with a kosher bias. On my first visit, I opted for the falafel pita. I wasn't sure what really to expect, I thought maybe 3 or 4 falafel along with some lettuce, tomato, and hummus. I could not have been more wrong. They take a warm, fluffy pita and stuff it with as many falafel as they can stuff into it, usually anywhere from 6-8. After that, you are asked what you would like on your flafel/sandwich: hummus, tahini, hot sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, pickled vegetables, tzatziki are just some of the condiments you can choose to top your order with.
The falafels themselves, are moist and nicely seasoned. All this delicious goodness for less than $8 is definitely a good value. If you decide to eat in, you can have AYCE picled vegetables and salads for $3! 

I have been back several times and although the owners can, at first, appear intimidating, service has always been friendly and quick. Everytime I have returned, I have ordered the falafel pita. It's not that I don't want to try their other menu items, but the falafel pita so good it's hard for me to order anything else."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Vegas!!!!!!
Shawarma shnitzel falafel and much more...
Good prices very good and fresh food and the owner moshe is great guy asking all the time if everything is good"}
{"text":"Shawarma Vegas or Skew Shawarma as we now know it has seen a full revamp of decor, showcases and front of the House service,to think of it as a little Falafel place would be an injustice to the Quality of the food, the friendly faces ready to serve you awesome food at a great dollar/value point. The menu has something for all, I ran in for a quick lunch, got a Falafel in Pita and had a most awesome meal, simple, healthy and delicious.
With the variety of choices, terrific Shwarma, Kabobs, Chicken, to delicious Soups, A plate with sides is my usual meal an array of salads and fresh cut french fries if you desire or Perfectly cooked rice...there is something for all.
Yes you feel like you are walking into a bit of Israel here in Vegas...but that is not a bad thing.
Salads and sides (Tahini, Matbucha, hummus and many other are available in to go containers so bring some home for your dinner table....A clean Friendly Great Place!
we all enjoy our food and Shawarma vegas is so Fresh and Good look no more you have arrived."}
{"text":"So after three days in Vegas for recent trade show I finally hit the bad hotel food, steak dinner, fast food & anything on the strip, wall.  I needed some, no make that, craved something unique & off the beaten path so when an old industry friend offered to take me & our other salesman out to dinner, I was all over it.

Having never really had much experience with kosher food aside from a Hebrew National frank & some macaroons I was a definite neophyte in this regard. The restaurant itself is actually a Glatt style kosher restaurant, which is essentially follows the strictest laws of the kosher standard.  The menu follows what are considered traditional Hebrew & Mediterranean cuisine most of them you've heard of  like shawarma, falafel, kabobs & pita based wraps.  The meal starts out with platters of salads & toppings for the pita breads.  Baba Ganoush, red & white cabbage, a Moroccan salad made with cucumber, tomatoe, red onion & spices, an awesome spicy eggplant relish & some& other tasty stuff.

We all had different entree's so I had a chance to try some of everything & everything simply rocked!  The falafel was smaller than I'm used to but extra crispy & then creamy on the inside. The kabobs were made with some of the tastiest, juiciest meat I've had in some time, was seasoned perfectly & BBQ'd to perfection.  The chicken shawarma, simply epic.  I could eat one of their chicken shawarma laffa sandwiches (aka burrito) every day & never get tired of it.  The fish balls were tender & tasty & the rib-eye, freaking unreal!

You can tell it's authentic kosher food just by their regulars on hand.  The jewish community in N. Vegas flock to this place & finding a table wasn't easy.  So it's a little of the beaten path (15 minutes from the strip)  a total hole in the wall, kinda slow service & the (almost) deal killer...NO beer, wine or other alcohol served there. (hello to-go order)  That aside I could put up with that a dozen times over again, the food is that good.  Beer & wine would have made it a perfect 5 star rating."}
{"text":"The best Kobe soup ever!!!
Best service, all fresh and tasty
They made the pita brad and baguette in the their bakery and it's soooo good!
Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and have always found the food excellent, good amount and the guys are always very nice.  But yesterday I need food for a Shiva and Shawarma Vegas out did itself.  It was a little last minute but they got everything ready on time and man was it great!!!!  Plus they gave us an amazing amount of food.  We had the kabbobs, baby chicken and the Merguez sausages were out of this world.  Plus the cabbage & Israeli salads, along with the hummus were fantastic.  I can't wait to go back for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! The best Mediterranean food I ever eat in my life!
It's reminds Israel! Amazing shawarma, everything fresh and clean. Great service"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Kosher joint in all of Las Vegas!

Really impressive food and a wide selection of shawarma....

Yummy yummy in my big tummy!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best hole in the wall Israeli food in Vegas. PERIOD. I never comment, but this place is amazing"}
{"text":"Were do I start :
* very clean place 
* awesome food,  there pita bread omg nice and fresh still puffed up right out the oven nice and hot sooooooo soft and deliciousness,  Shwarma had really great flavor and I like that it comes with harissa,  pickled veggies, your choice of green or purple pickled cabbage, you can even have rice, tahini or hummus so good
* Nice staff they welcome you in and help explain there menu options that's always a plus 
* family restaurant 
* prices are so so not to bad
Overall I give this place 4 stars really good food must try"}
{"text":"Food is decent but I'm not sure I ever had such bad service. The man behind the counter, who I assume is the owner, had the worst attention span I've ever seen in anyone over the age of 5. 

His wife, who sat in the \"restaurant,\" continued to distract him by coming up to the desk asking for more food for herself. He would stop whatever he was working on to make it for her. It then took him an additional 10 minutes to ring us up from the time our food was finished! Absolutely ridiculous!"}
{"text":"My Israeli friend's been raving about this place for months, and she finally shlepped me there.  It was worth the wait.

Yes, it's a hole in the wall, but it's more like eating in my Grandma's kitchen - except my Grandma wasn't Moroccan or Iraqi, which is definitely the accent here.

My friend warned me that the platters were too big for one person (or at least two women trying to keep their, ahem, girlish figures) to eat, so we shared a Chicken Shawarma platter.

This is a Meal (capital M).  The larger plate had a good-sized portion of chicken pieces.  They were tasty, but I swear, I couldn't tell whether they were dark or white meat.  This was accompanied by a large helping of rice covered with pinto beans in sauce (we could have chosen green beans as a topping).  The smaller plate had Israeli salad - basically chopped and seasoned cucumber and tomato - along with baba ganouche, hummus, and a red cabbage salad that was scrumptious.  A third plate had four mini pitas (more upon request).  The idea was to pull off pieces of the the pita and make little mini sandwiches with all the ingredients.  Luckily, I was there with a native, to teach me the ropes and translate the waitress, Gila, who's also the cook and owner, with her husband.  Gila speaks English, but obviously preferred to converse with my friend in Hebrew.

My friend bought a box of pastries - Gila made - to take home, but we snacked on them for dessert.  They were farina-based, stuffed with dates, deep-fried, then baked, and finally, dipped in honey.  They were so out of this world delicious that I wanted to take home a box, too, but she got the last one!

As mentioned in the other review, there is no beer or wine, but there's not even coffee, due to an agreement with the Pannini Cafe next door.  That, together with the mystery chicken, is the reason for this not being a five-star review.  But it's damned close, and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is not the Shawarma I am used to. If you want real Shawarma, you have to go to Dearborn, Michigan, or Lebanon. This is not even close. It was aweful. I still have not found a place on the West Coast that makes good authentic Shawarma sandwiches.

Shawarma is lamb or chicken that is spiced and cooks while it turns on a ventricle roaster. The cooked meat is cut off as it turns and then rolled in pita bread. The meat shawarma usually comes warped with onions and tahini sauce with pickled turnips. The chicken is rolled with a garlic sauce and pickled cucumbers. Both sandwiches are then placed on a panini grill to toast the bread. That is a shawarma sandwich.

Note******
This place was on Dirty Dining in July. I just seen that today on the Channel 13 website."}
{"text":"Came here with my family, walked in by accident not knowing about the place.
I have 2 things I want to write 
1) Wow - service, general feeling
2) amazing - the food is just spectacular. 

Definitely will be back for more.

From 1 - 10 food rate.

Shawarma - 10
Schnitzel - 9.4
Salads - 10
Hamburger - 9.8"}
{"text":"First time having shwarma. Service was friendly, and helpful. Chicken shwarma in lafa put zabas to shame in taste and size. I highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I have worked with Shwarma Vegas the last two summers when we bring our traveling camp for teenagers to Las Vegas. Moshe the owner is very accommodating and generous.

This year our group was half special needs kids and everything was great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Filthy I saw cockroaches crawling , I got sick after eating ,I throw up never go back there again"}
{"text":"I wrote a pretty scathing review of a prior experience, so you may wonder why the new 5 stars review?

1)The Owner reached out to apologize for our experience and took action to address it immediately.

2) The food is THAT good.

The worker prioritized other customer's orders had been let go.  The Owner had communicated to his entire staff based our our reviews and retrained them to his standards.  He has also been on location the last few times we've been back both serving in the line and directing his staff.

You don't always get it right, but it's a rare quality when someone reflects on what went wrong and fixed it going forward."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sharma sandwhich on a baguette.  It was actually pretty good. I have had quite a few of these from other places and this was definitely tasty. The reason for the 3 star rating is the fact that the order was 11.95 on the menu. I only ordered the sandwhich and when I went to pay he charged me 15 dollars even. Ummmm....how do you figure that? Let's see today's price is 15...lol..whatever...just kinda shady"}
{"text":"It's great food. The Jerusalem Mix is the shawarma grilled with onions. The smell of it cooking is fantastic.

The place is kosher. Don't expect to go after sundown the day before the sabbath (Friday). 

The cook was very friendly. The muscle bound owner must have been mad that I interrupted his prayers or something because he showed that he didn't give a rat's ass whether I spent my money with him or not. Two $10 sandwiches and not a smile, not thank you, nothing. I'm sorry, did me asking questions about the menu bother you? (I didn't ask during his prayers.)

A customer actually answered my questions.

Judging from the lack of business at lunch time, he NEEDS to learn that you at the very least should treat your customers with respect, not contempt. You had 28 demerits and were featured on Dirty Dining.

If you want to stay open, the owner should stay away from the customers. He's obviously not going to change his attitude.

If he can't, then they deserve to go out of business. Since one order was a large portion of the \"Lunch Rush\", that should be pretty soon."}
{"text":"A hidden gem found thanks to Yelp.  Best baba ganoush I've ever tasted with a heavenly garlic undertone.   All sides were fresh and flavorful.   Shwarma and kabobs were seasoned very well.  Some  of the best we've ever had the pleasure to eat.  Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I have worked in the area for about 9 months.  Upset I didn't find this gem sooner. Will be going back for lunch again soon.  Friendly staff and fresh food."}
{"text":"I remember seeing this close a while back and was surprised to see it open again under presumably a new owner. 

As we were waiting for our food to arrive, we were entertained that it seemed like everyone knew everyone and no one was speaking English. This though makes me feel excited as it can only mean authentic food.

I saw on the menu that you can get for $3 AYCE of the salads which consisted of hummus, baba ganoush, a vinegar based slaw, carrot and cauliflower pickles, pickled peppers, cucumber tomato salad, onions with sumac, red cabbage salad All of them were good, fresh and seasoned well. The hummus and baba is really good and would cost you a lot more than $3 anywhere else for a single serving of one of them. 

BF and I got the falafel pita (I believe $6.99). Once they stuff them in the pocket they ask you what else you want in it (basically from the salads I mentioned above) along with options for garlic sauce and hot sauce as well. The seasoning on the falafel was good and they were lightly crunchy and soft inside. I prefer more soft than crunchy like chips so it made me quite happy and the pita was fluffy and everything I think good bread should be. Both the BF and I are huge fans of the falafel at Amenas and this is really good that they are equal contenders for the top pocket. 

There was a bit of confusion (language barrier?) as to the salad sampler but eventually I got a little plate to try them and the lady was really sweet anyways.

 I definitely will be back again to have more of this falafel and maybe try other offerings on the menu. I think this little hole in the wall is a must try if you like Mediterranean fare."}
{"text":"This place is the best tasting kosher place in Vegas. We have tried them all please don't judge this place by how it looks if you want good authentic food this is the place wow"}
{"text":"I was in the area looking for a quick bite to eat in between errands and I am so happy that I stopped by here! Thank you Yelp for helping me find this gem! Small shop filled with delicious aromas of the Mediterranean and Israeli food cooking in the kitchen.  

I ordered a Shawarma Pita ($10).  It is stuffed full of Moroccan spiced chicken and topped with any combination of hummus, Israeli salad, and tahini sauce.  The service was super fast and friendly.  I can't wait to come back and try many of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service will definitely return on my next vegas trip worth the trip from the strip about 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Been in vegas last week one of the best Israeli restaurant I been in the whole USA 
the service is great all taste so good and the place is very clean 
Highly recommend you to go and eat there"}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from my friend's barber...they said it was the most authentic shawarma in Vegas.  If someone says that, you gotta check a place out!

This place is on the corner near the gas station.  All tasty places usually are, aren't they?  You step inside a small restaurant, about 5 tables or so and there's an open view into the kitchen.  The place seems pretty legit and authentic...I am basing this on the fact that the cooks/servers couldn't really speak English.  We tried to ask them some questions about the menu but one guy couldn't really explain and then another server said, \"Don't ask him about the menu.  What do you want to know?\"  So then we asked that guy questions but still didn't get answers we understood.  lol.  They were all super friendly though.

We ordered a chicken shawarma ($9.99) and chicken shawarma plate ($14.99).  The shawarma is pretty large...saw them wrapping that bad boy up.  The shawarma plate comes with a salad (veggies), pita and hummus.  The pita is fluffy and soft.

I would recommend trying this place at least once.  Can't say it's the best shawarma since I'm not a shawarma connoisseu, but it was an enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Good food . Very authentic. Hard to find . Great attitude . Cozy place.  Will go back for sure I wish they were open little later too"}
{"text":"We used to like this place. However, the last two times we went were unsatisfying. I ordered the \"Rib Eye\" for $22.00. The piece of steak/meat or whatever I received was 40 percent repulsive fat with some rice for over $22...wow. Should not even be on the menu. Won't be going back anytime soon. Also the time before everything was very dry and had very little taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The shawarma is out of this world! Everything was fresh, and tasted homemade."}
{"text":"I get the chicken shawarma every time I come in and it is on point! Highly recommend this joint"}
{"text":"I am impressed. The food is awesome. While the price seems a little high, I had enough food for 2 meals and grazing. It was a so much food for the price. The Shawarma hit the spot. The beets and cabbage salads are to die for. The atmosphere is super casual and not trendy. this is just a little hole in the wall. I wasn't prepared for the large number of obviously religious people. I felt a little uncomfortable in my tiny tank and shorts for the heat. I will go back wearing more clothing."}
{"text":"There are few things in life that make me happier than falafel and shawarma.  These guys deliver above average quality for both and I already know I'll be a return customer.

The falafel plate was around $11 and it was huge.  The balls themselves were smaller than usual but that was made up for in quantity as you can see from the photo I took.  An overall 3.5 star falafel in the world is pretty much a 5 star falafel in Las Vegas.  The plate also came with my choice of 4 sides to make up my salad side of it.  I went with babaganoush, hummus, a red cabbage salad and their Israeli salad.  It also came with a big side of rice and beans so I pretty much had lunch for the next day.

I just HAD to sample the shawarma so being the pig that I am, I got a shawarma sandwich to go too.  The quality of their pita was very good and although I prefer lamb shawarma, their chicken was still great.  They allow to put in whatever you'd like in the sandwich and as much as the pita can fit so I went wild with every little thing.  You should too.  

The dining area is OK and teetering on hole in the wall status.  I see myself doing takeout orders for the most part."}
{"text":"Set down for lunch with friends, great shawarma, the guys are friendly and the service was pretty fast, each dish came full with sides and extras, been here a few times, love coming back, clean place and the waitress was very kind and helpful, be sure to come back"}
{"text":"Starving on a Sunday afternoon, I decided to try Shawarma Vegas since i had a particular craving for seemingly good chicken shawarma from the pictures.  This place did not disappoint!  At first glance, it's typical of a small, hole in the wall shop with a basic sign and just a few tables inside.  Waiting in line to order i could see all the fresh ingredients i could choose with my chicken shawarma.  I placed my order for a chicken shawarma pita with salad which was prepared fresh in a bowl and upon suggestion of the friendly preparer I added some house spicy sauce, onions and tahini on the end of the wrap.  He was kind enough to give me a plentiful side of peppers and pickles to accompany my sandwich.  Pricing was very good for the portion and the chicken was extremely juicy and tender when biting into the sandwich.  Definitely a mixture of flavor with the chicken shawarma, salad, tahini and pita.  Adding pickles and peppers into the mix it was a delicious meal and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I've been to Israel and was craving shwarma.. I ordered the lafa shwarma.. per the menu online it said that it came with french fries inside the wrap.. i asked the guy if I could get the fries on the side.. The guy who took my order was great.. He was meticulous in changing spoons and gloves to make sure nothing was contaminated. The cashier on the otherhand was not as careful.They have a premixed salad.. i told him I wanted everything so he used that instead of the fresher looking vegetables..  I was charged an extra $2 for the fries that were supposed to be included. When I asked, he told me that fries are extra... doesn't say so on the menu.. so needless to say my total was almost $18.. for 1 sandwich..  wasn't a happy camper when I left.

Next I got home with high hopes.. I'm not sure exactly what the meat was.. but there was chicken in it.. it wasn't thinly cut like I'm used to.. they were almost like what I would get on my teriyaki chicken.. 

Overall, it wasn't bad.. just way overpriced I feel for what I received."}
{"text":"Good, fairly basic place; their namesake dish is tasty and while the pita they put it on isn't huge, the serving size is filling. Price is a little high. Quality is solid though."}
{"text":"Glory has been restored, the place is back in the hands of the original owner and things are back to normal, xlnt as usual."}
{"text":"Quite the experience walking into this restaurant, the man behind the counter, Moshe, is entertaining. I ate by shwarama vegas almost every night I was in Vegas. I ordered food for shabbos as well. We were impressed by his shabbos menu that included morocan fish and whatever chicken, meats or sides you want. His prices were very fair and the amount of food he gave us was unbelievable (we were 4 people easily could have fed 6-7). It didn't stop there, he went out of his way to come talk to us at our table and welcome us to the city. 

He is very knowledgeable person about many topics such as israeli politics, Obama, American Express and his good friend Ayal Golan."}
{"text":"This Place is unreal. we just got home and It is by hands down the best we have ever had.  The falafel's were wonderful, and the Hummus was great.  The service was top of the line and every one was extremely friendly. we cant wait to go back, Shawarma Vegas will be on our regular eating circles.  Love Love Love."}
{"text":"The shawarma  was excellent and very reasonably priced.i liked that they put the little salads on the table while you were waiting"}
{"text":"If you want to spend the latter part of your afternoon sitting on a toilet, be their guest. The place will offer you A LOT of food for really cheap in addition offers unlimited salads. Though, you will discover the restaurant to be filthy, never any of their items on their menu to be stocked up. On one instance, we found roach coming out of their salad bar. absolutely disgusting."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place with ambiance, this is not the place. We walked in, no one greeted us. We had to figure out if we order at the counter or sit down. There were a few men taking photos of food for marketing and one guy had a drone filming. This is a small place and that was obnoxious. By the end we realized they were all together. 
Food was good. The cabbage was made nicely and the falafel was crunchy and green inside, the correct way to make it."}
