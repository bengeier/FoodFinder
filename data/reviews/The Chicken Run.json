{"text":"This is a spin-off of the famous, amazing, incredible Candlelight Inn in Sterling, IL...and The Chicken Run serves the Candlelight's signature Chicken George!  (Kinda like chicken fingers...but better.)  Chicken George is amazing.  Ask for \"Jan's Sauce\" and enjoy.  So, so good."}
{"text":"Restaurant has 3 small tables for dining in and has a compact menu that focuses on their specialty - Chicken George. Chicken George is \"Fresh chicken tenders, hand-battered and deep fried to perfection, served with our house special, Jan's sauce\" according to the menu.   Having grown up in the area where Chicken George was invented I can tell you these are the best chicken strips you'll have, hands down. Jan's sauce is a sweet, tangy sauce that pairs perfectly. They have other sauces as well but you must try the Jan's sauce. The chicken isn't heavily breaded and tastes nothing like anything I've ever found in the area.  We had the 1/2 pound Chicken George with fries, which is plenty of food for a person. The fries are like thin shoestring fries with salt and pepper. You get a large portion of these and they are hard to stop eating. They're crunchy and seasoned just right. We also sampled the cheese curds which are amazing and squeaky as they should be.  Staff was friendly and service was fast. Everything was made fresh. They serve canned pop (Pepsi products) and bottled water as well.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great food,& staff,, I'm alittle partial, taking care of the parking lot(snow).. but it's always hot and fresh.. ORDER ONLINE..saves time"}
{"text":"I was really happy with the chicken run!  They make great chicken fingers and great sauces. The menu is straightforward and they stick to what they are great at. Definitely will be back.   I recommend the Jan and Chicken run sauces.  Top notch."}
{"text":"I love chicken! I excited to try this new place in Middleton. What I found was hugely disappointing. Bland...just plain bland battered chicken. While the dipping sauce was fine, the chicken itself had no flavor. The fries were toothpick thin and had no discernable potato flavor. I will go to Popeye's for my chicken fix."}
{"text":"There   Ok but too much salt  in chicken   And prices are too  much  for me  fries  are too  thin  and very salty  wount be going there  anymore too  pricey for me"}
{"text":"The cheese curds were great! Menu isn't very diverse, but what's on the menu is really good."}
{"text":"I called an order in and it was hot and ready when I arrived. Great chicken and GREAT sauces! I'm super picky about fried chicken and it passed my test. The \"fries\" are interesting...hubby loved them, I thought they were ok. Overall, it's worth it to try this place out."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious. The chicken breading is closer to that on Chinese food rather than buttermilk breading. The deep fried Oreos we're delicious and reminded me of a fair."}
{"text":"Great chicken tenders and fried Oreos are a necessity.  We were super excited for a new restaurant around the corner and it did not disappoint.   Quick and simple but very tasty."}
{"text":"They are doing chicken tenders up right!  Actually are different, and better, than your typical tender.  Batter seems smoother, chicken moist and good quality.  Good cheese curds too.  \"Jan's Sauce\" seems like the best of the offerings.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken!   Is it fancy? No. But that's what makes it good. The menu is as simple as it gets - chicken and fries. Our food was cooked to order and came out to our car HOT! The star for me was the sauces that accompanied the chicken - Jan's sauce was our fave. The price was right too. The fries weren't traditional fries, but I did enjoy the seasoning they had.  We'd stop here again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"The best thing was the large absorbent napkin. It was badly needed. Picked up the dinner and a side of curd. Fresh is not a word I'll use. The chicken appears to be good quality but had been sitting for longer than it should have. The very thin cut fries should have been crispy but were over cooked and limp. Fried hours ago? And the curd? Anyone who cooks recognizes food that has been fried at too low a temp. The amount of oil resulted in curds with no squeak and no crunch. This was disappointing as the reviews were good. Will I try this again? When it's this awful, it's not worth another try. Apparently one needs to be there at the right time or the right staff working. If you decide to try it, good luck - you'll need it. A star is mandatory. If it wasn't The Chicken Run wouldn't get one."}
{"text":"Not much of a selection. Chicken tenders, fries, cheese curds, and fried Oreos. We have only had the tenders which are amazing and fries. We have gone 3 times since they have been open. Their staff are friendly and food we had was good."}
{"text":"Their chicken tenders are moist, perfectly seasoned (not too salty), and still have nice crispiness from is batter! Their fries are amazing! It's well seasoned and super crunchy!   If you have a movie night or friends coming over, their chicken tenders and fries are perfect companion for beers!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken and fries with two sauces (second sauce was extra).  I gave my debit card for payment and my food came out almost as fast as I got my receipt.  While I appreciate fast service, it had me questioning the freshness of the food.  Those concerns were validated when I tasted the chicken.  I was hoping for made to order chicken, but was disappointed with pre-fried, sitting under a heat lamp taste.  The chicken almost looked like fried fish with a chicken McNugget taste.  It wasn't terrible, and I assume would have tasted ten times better if fresh.  The fries and sauce were the best part of the meal.  Shoestring style fries with a nice salt and pepper taste.  Sauces were sweet and tangy.  Would recommend both of the house sauces.  The drive thru was very convenient."}
{"text":"Praise be chicken!!  This place is awesome- we have had it 2x now and the breading on the chicken is almost tempura-like....so light and not overwhelming.  The chicken is the star!  I feel like a kid ordering chicken strips but I have accepted that- it's worth it!!  Not the biggest fan of the super crispy crunchy fries but I can deal.  Get here!!"}
{"text":"The chicken and curds are awesome!! They don't have much of a selection, but if you want chicken then you will love it!!!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST chicken fingers ever, right out of the Candlelight in Sterling, IL. Won't need to drive 150 miles anymore to have this delicacy. Hope others find this gem"}
{"text":"If you want $7 worth of chicken and cheese curds for $13, this is the place for you! The chicken is a touch on the dry side, but the curds and sauce are good. Although the curds had cooked by the time I got home to the point that they were basically just warm cheese coated in grease. I would say it's worth going once, but I'm not sure I'll be back. Between Culver's, Hardee's, and recently McDonald's, there's not exactly a dearth of better-prepared chicken tenders in Middleton."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place existed, and if I hadnt been asked to meet someone there, I probably would have never found out.  It is a fast food chicken strip takeout joint.  Similar concept to Zaxby's or Raising Cane's, but locally owned (technically the owners are from Illinois and have one other restaurant there) and less frills.  You can get chicken, fries, and cheese curds.  That's it.  No dining area to speak of.  I believe they have fountain drinks.  There's a drive through.    Chicken tenders were moist, perfectly fried, and tasted hand battered.  However they didnt really have any seasoning to speak of.  The house made sauces were GREAT (the Chicken Run sauce is very similar to Zax Sauce and Cane's Sauce, a thousand-islandy-mustardy sort of thing) but I could have used some seasoning on the chicken itself.  The fries were so thinly sliced my wife called them \"julienne\".  I couldnt really eat them as we were in the car between errands work.  I would have needed a fork, especially to dip them in anything.  I didnt try the cheese curds but I bet they're GREAT.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"Very small building but with GREAT chicken and food. Priced very well and the food portions are good. Hopefully this place sticks around!!"}
{"text":"I liked it. The chicken isn't like crunchy fried chicken and the French fries are more like potato sticks, once you get past this and realize it's  pretty good! The chicken is moist and tastes delicious. I got the jans sauce and chicken run sauce. Liked them both. Different than any sauce I've had before and I liked that. Jans sauce is light and a little sweet it compliments the salt on the chicken and the chicken run sauce is more creamy with more savory notes. The French fries are kinda crunchy and addictive. The cheese curds some aren't as crunchy but as I kept eating the my thought was these are good. This is also good hang over food And the drive thru makes it easy and convenient. The employee helping me was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The chicken is pretty great but personally I don't care for the fries as they are the very thin shoestring variety.  Some people might be into it but I'm not.  Kind of wish there was one other side option besides fries or curds (or an option for just chicken, didn't see one).  Will try curds next time."}
{"text":"Disappointed as I've watched this restaurant morph from its former self to The Chicken Run. $8 for 6 small pieces of chicken (battered and bland) and fried ??? I guess it's supposed to be potatoes but all I tasted was seasoning salt, and two cups of sauces we didn't enjoy, makes this a nonstarter."}
{"text":"Stopped in for carry-out.  What you see is what you get-chicken tenders in different sizes with the option of fries or curds.  I opted for the chicken tenders and fries.  The chicken tenders are fried fresh and have an interesting batter on them-more of a tempura that a traditional breading.  The fries are matchstick thin and just not my thing.  Like taste more like potato sticks you get out of a can at the supermarket that something fried.  You aren't going to get a gold star for healthy eating options here but in a pinch and for a quick meal, it does just fine."}
{"text":"I didn't know this brand had such a following in Illinois. I had never heard of it but every time I drove down University Avenue, it was \"opening soon.\" I had to try it out.  Here are things I experienced: 1) YES to the Drive Thru! Table space is limited so I am glad that I was able to drive up to a well lit menu and place my order. Staying in my warm car in the winter is preferred.  2) The menu is LIMITED. This is okay because it's what makes it work. Sides are only cheese curds or shoestring french fries. I haven't tried the curds yet, but the fries had the right amount of salt/pepper, but was a bit too greasy for me (probably because it was super fresh).  3) Everything is SUPER FRESH. They even say it as they are handing you your order in a pizza box.   4) Lots of sauce options. I went with their house sauce. It was thicker than I expected. It reminded me of Cane's special sauce if you know what that is.  5) Sorry--- but the chicken tenders reminded me of the sweet and sour chicken nuggets you find at chinese buffets. Don't get me wrong--it was good and delicious, but I don't know if it was worth the price.   Overall--it's ok. I probably would go if I had no other options, which there really aren't that many in that part of Middleton/Near West Madison. I wish there were more side options (regular fries, curly fries, onion rings)."}
{"text":"Delicious is the cheese curds and chicken. Our second time there. Service is always quick and friendly. French fries are addicting."}
{"text":"The chicken is moist, tasty, and high quality. It tastes great! The sauces are great!   It's battered, not breaded, so it's not as crunchy as it could be. But I don't think that's their intention. If you're really expecting a lot of crunch go to Wings Over Madison down the street.  The fries on the other hand are very thin, thinner than I've ever seen, and they are very crunchy! My family fights over the crispiest french fry when we get them, those odd thin pieces that are cooked more... well, the entire order is like that here.  So I say that their fries are amazing.   Know that they don't consider themselves fully open for business yet. They've only had a soft opening and will be doing a grand opening soon. They're considering expanding their menu for the grand opening or maybe shortly after, to include stuff like fried fish. So now is your chance to let them know what you'd like to see on the menu.   Dude gave me an extra sauce for free!"}
{"text":"I grew up where this \"new\" restaurant started in Illinois over 50 years ago. They took the BEST items from that start to create this carry out and limited seating spot. \"Chicken George\" is a breaded chicken that is a unique and wonderful way to prepare. A one pound order for under $15 is enough for a couple, so it is a great value. Since this place is new, you can get this without a wait but once it catches on, look out. Love it and will be back, sounds like the \"official\" grand opening in February."}
{"text":"Small location with just 3 tables. Simple and easy menu with little to choose from, but the food seems to be cooked to order and fresh. Chicken tenders seems to be all breast meat and battered instead of breaded. Chicken was just cooked perfectly. Cheese Curds were fresh too. As for the fries, wish they were a bit bigger as they were too small to munch on and seems to be more of a chip like texture instead of the typical fries you get. The Jan Sauce was very unique too, but very flavorful. We asked the manager what was in it and was amazed what he mentioned (a lot of sugar, mayo, Tabasco, etc.). Couldn't taste the Tabasco, but to me it kind of have a yogurt taste to it.  I would recommend this place as it was a great experience.  Workers were very nice and friendly. Two of them stopped by at different times to check if we needed anything else.  Wish they had fountain drinks instead of canned soda and bottled water"}
{"text":"Service was great. Nice young guy who was very polite  and seemed to care that I have a positive experience when I told him it was my first visit. However, I was bummed in the end. My fried cheese curds where clearly fried in oil that had not come up to temp yet. The batter was soggy, not crispy, and they we're literally dripping with oil. Also a little salty but that might have been good if they were crisp. I realized after my first cheese curd  that I had arrived just after opening. This could explain the under heated oil issue. Chicken was better, clearly fresh, white meat, quality chicken but was likely suffering from the same issue as the curds. Crispier would have been better. Sauces we're very good. I'll probably give this place a second chance as it's in a location that is convenient for me and I try to support family run start ups. I hope to update this post. I don't like to give poor reviews but this issue should be noted by management. Hopefully they're still reading these posts. I would have brought my issues back to the restaurant but I went through the drive through and I didn't have time to turn back."}
