{"text":"My fiance and I are here almost weekly for wing night. Best wings around! Good, hearty size, and delicious sauces. The Sweet N Hot are my personal favorite and I haven't had anything like it anywhere else. Burgers are good size, delicious and not dripping in grease, which I like. Great fries and tots. I've never had a bad meal here. Good atmosphere and my favorite small, hometown, \"hole in the wall\" bar, but I definitely don't say that in a bad way. Plenty of TV's to keep everyone satisfied and the wait staff/bartenders are always friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"First of all, who closes 3 hours early? Went in at 11, Andrea said she called last call. She was kind enough to pour us a drink while she \"cleaned up.\" We proceeded to drink our terrible drinks  (ordered titos, it wasnt). We were shocked as she gave her friends more beer as we were rushing to leave. As far as i know last call means last call. But then again i expect a business to adhere to their business hours."}
{"text":"This place totally rocks! 
The friendliest bar around with a great menu!
Saturdays they have KARAOKE with Stu-dio Entertainment this guy is nuts! What a blast I'm will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good cocktails and food.  Owners seem really nice and the place is full of energy.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was home made and fresh. I got chicken tenders and fries and it was all home made, not that frozen crap. The girls who were waitressing were very friendly. The inside was your normal, kinda crappy local bar, but it looked clean. The food was reasonably priced. I'm glad I stopped in for some quick food."}
{"text":"The bartenders here are always very attentive and sweet. Beer selection is decent and the food is always good and hot. I think they changed their garlic parmesan wing recipe, which makes me sad because my boyfriend and I used to go just for that. There's a neighborhood vibe here that I love. If you're stopping for a few drinks and some lunch, this place is perfect for a casual stop."}
