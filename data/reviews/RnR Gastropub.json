{"text":"My date and I came here for an early evening drink and appetizer. They sat us on the 2nd floor balcony which I highly recommend even if it's a tad chilly outside (they had space heaters). The beer selection was good, but not great as you would expect at a \"gastropub\". Maybe 15-20 beers total in this place. We had the hangover fries sans-eggs and these were fantastic! Great amount of toppings and the fries themselves are delicious. Crispy on the outside like Arby's curly fries. So good!"}
{"text":"They have Reverse Happy Hour from 10pm to midnight on Fridays. We got half off our meal, beer, and margaritas! Be careful: it doesn't apply to all beverages. I ordered a beergarita (beer + margarita), which was not half off.  I had the Bacon Brussels Burger, their award winning signature item. It was awesome! Thick cut bacon, medium cooked burger, all in a pretzel bread bun; so savory! I couldn't taste the brussels sprouts. But the pretzel bread, I could eat that by itself! For my side, I had parmesan fries, which were just as good.   The margaritas are great, especially at half off which was about $4. I wouldn't pay $8 for them; too small a glass for that price. Service was fast and friendly. Overall an excellent experience!"}
{"text":"Finished my sisters bachelorette weekend here for some Sunday funday drinking.  It took awhile to get a table but was so worth the wait! We had endless mimosas and bloody Mary's and our food was delicious! The best part was our server Elatish. She was so fun and full of energy.  I would definitely go back.   We had a blast.  Great food, dj, drinks and tvs so we could watch football."}
{"text":"Great food! Great drinks, great Happy Hours. Gotta have the Bacon Brussel sprouts! Southwest chicken salad is a hit as is the pulled pork."}
{"text":"It can be kind of frustrating when random quirkiness wins a bar loads of attention, but in RnR's case it sort of deserves it. The place is well-designed, well-staffed and well-stocked. The atmosphere is calm yet eclectic, and the whole experience feels complete. That may seem like an odd statement but it's not rare to wander into a restaurant and feel that there is a certain element missing. RnR is not one of those places.  The service was above average, the waitress was knowledgeable about the menu & made a solid effort to ask if we needed more drinks or anything else. ~Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They have the best Turkey Burgers I have ever had! I also recommend the parmigiano Fries. The burgers are messy and delicious,  even if they are a bit pricey.  Pricey is to be expected in Old Town Scottsdale though."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Service was terrible. Typical scottsdale. Expected a little more. The cost was good."}
{"text":"So, living in, or near New Jersey, New York, and Philly has spoiled me when it comes to great food, pretty people, trendy spots, and yummy happy hours!  RnR is one of my new favorite places that mirrors a trendy spot in the Village in NYC.  Upon turning the corner and seeing it's beauty, I was immediately in love.  Once on the other side of that by and beautiful wooden door, I was greeted by a lovely young lady with a pink bang and barely there outfit with great customer service skills.  We arrived too late to experience the $15.00 bottomless mimosa brunch but just in time for happy hour! Bingo!!!!!!  The menu had some unique choices and we opted for animal fries, which was about 1/2 pound of pulled pork over French and Sweet potato fries covered in herbs and aged cheddar cheese, and ahi tuna tacos which were good enough to order again.  As for drinks, the margaritas were banging!!!!!! My friend had a pineapple margarita and then a glass of the Alaskan Amber Ale on tap (good damn beer) and , I had a mango and a chipotle pineapple margarita.  They were amazing, each in their own ways and they were $4.00 each! The beer I think was $2.00.  I will definitely be back here as often as possible but next time with a Designated Driver and an IV filled with H20 so that I can simultaneously hydrate my poor body!  Oh, and the service was pretty good for them to be so busy taking care of drunk people who just want to have fun, me and my friend included!  The music was amazing as well, I almost created my own dance floor! Maybe next time I will!!"}
{"text":"This place has real potential but falls short in a few areas for sure.    The bar staff is somewhat attentive but seems to be more preoccupied with spinning glasses than serving drinks in a timely fashion.  One bartender broke a glass right in front of me while flipping it.  The staff seemed inexperienced and not well trained. I repeatedly watched the bartenders scoop ice out of the ice bins with a pint glass, its just a matter of time before someone ends up with a glass chip in their drink.     The waiter I had took almost ten minutes to greet us. He showed up with no menus or drink lists but expected us to know what we wanted once he finally showed up.  He was pleasant enough but again just not super sharp.  The look of the place is pretty cool. The patio is sweet and I love the decor for the most part.  I noticed some other \"restaurant rip offs\" like the gum bullseyes that Postino has at their wine bars.  Everyplace doesn't need to be super original but some things are blatant and show no imagination.   All in all I was not impressed. This place needs some real direction and fine tuning."}
{"text":"By bar one of the worst experiences EVER! My sister heard great things about this place and had been dying to go, so we went.   It wasn't what we expected at 9 am but decided to still try it out because the food looked so amazing.   When we sat down the waiter asked did we want the mimosa we declined but he didn't even give us the chance to order anything else. My sister and I sat and talked and I realized he never came back. I had failed attempts getting is attention. Not to mention I had to yell \"HELLO\" to get the attention of the hostess to let her know we hadn't been helped.  Ultimately, we got up and left. The waiter saw us leaving and asked were we going downstairs? No sir we are leaving.   I wish I could tell you how the water tasted but be that we didn't even get that far. :("}
{"text":"At first glance, RnR is fresh, trendy, and part of the urban rebranding in Scottsdale.  There is ample seating at the bar, which is always a plus and a large patio.  I stopped by at lunch time and had fast/friendly service from the host and the girls behind the bar.  Another eye catcher was they serve breakfast until 2pm and the board out front seemed to have some decent happy hour specials.  A discount or special would be a plus.  The only concern seemed that the menu is a little pricey for the type of  food.  I tried the grilled chicken sandwich which is server on foccacia smothered with pesto and melted brie.  They do offer 3 different types of sides, parmesan fries, sweet potatoe fries, or chips.  Washed it down with a Coors light draft bringing a sandwich and a beer to $18 plus tip.  I'd be happy to go back for happy hour, but didn't think it was worth $21 bucks for lunch"}
{"text":"Will recommend to all of my friends and coworkers this place is great. Not only is the food here amazing our server Lilly was a cute blonde girl who made our experience better than ever. RnR is my new favorite sports bar, the food is good the drinks are good the service is good and it's a blast."}
{"text":"I have seen this place on the weekend evenings all packed with people looking like they're sardines in a can, so what possessed me to go there for brunch one day?  I shall never know.  I did, though, and I have to say, the food was yuck, the coffee was watered down, and the service was slow.  I ordered the two 'specialties' on the menu, which were the Sundried Scramble with sun-dried tomatoes, basil, goat cheese and scrambled eggs and the maple-bacon scone.  Aside from the fact that my brunch buddie and I literally waited 30 minutes for the food to come out, the food wasn't even that good!!  The Sundried Scramble was something I probably could've made myself at home (and better!), and the scone was just not good.  Actually, they brought out the wrong scone at first, and when the correct one came out, I thought, I should've just said not to bring one at all cuz it was drier than what people who don't live in Arizona consider the state's summers.  Also, as my friend and I were walking up to RnR, I saw one of the wait staff lounging around with sunglasses on.  Forgive me if I am wrong, but I think sunglasses should not be worn by wait staff at a restaurant especially for brunch if you are trying to make a statement that the place is as classy as Scottsdale thinks it is.  Shame on you, RnR.  I'm going across the street to go eat at Daily Dose."}
{"text":"VERY crowded/busy brunch spot in Oldtown Scottsdale.  Lots of Scottsdale bros and broettes, which is fine.  Loud, which again, is fine.  I went with a bunch of friends for brunch.  There was about an hour wait, so we sat at the bar while waiting for a table.  The downstairs outside bartender was pretty good, let us do the bottomless bloodies/mimosas even though we hadn't ordered any food yet.  He was making them pretty well, and seemed like a friendly dude.  It has a lot of tvs, so it's a good place to watch a game.  Once we went upstairs for our table and ordered, the food was pretty solid (I got the protein pancakes, which were very solid-yummy), but they were pouring the bloodies and mimosas from a big pitcher at the bar, which is never a good sign.  Overall, good time, but it was super crowded.  The other people who declare that this place has great bloodies have probably never had a really good bloody mary.  They were solid, not spectacular, and pretty weak on alcohol."}
{"text":"I'm here practically every other weekend for brunch. It's lit. It's good. I have a great time and everyone is really cool. Whenever we can we sit with Shelby not only for the great service but because she is just so damn personable, and just cool as hell.   If you're complaining about waiting, well learn some patience. If you're going to go to one of the busiest brunch spots around, it takes time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was visiting Scottsdale last week with a friend for baseball spring training. Ordered a round of drinks. Had a second & thought I was under charged. That's when the waitress told us between 3 & 7 it was 1/2 price happy hour. Great! Came back the second day after the game at 4:00 for drinks & ordered a round. Waitress said $11. I asked her wasn't it happy hr? She was very apologetic. I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Came back the third day after a game at 5:00 & ordered a round. The third different server said $11. Again I asked him wasn't it happy hr? He apologized & charged us happy hr prices. We were not happy. We felt like they were trained to cheat tourists. We were wearing  our Giants garb. We will not go there again."}
{"text":"Architecturally interesting, that is the best bit about this place. Went for brunch on mothers day with a friend after trying to go to another crowded place up the street. I had bacon and eggs with a pancake side, she had the veggie burger. We were both quite full after the meal but there was nothing terrible remarkable for either of us, my food tasted as if it sat in the window for a while, the eggs were lukewarm, and the potatoes were almost cold to the touch, as was the toast. The staff seemed friendly, and were reasonably attentive."}
{"text":"We checked out RnR on Sunday (just a few days after opening.) In all fairness, I have to agree with many of the other reviews. Even though they are new, these things are fixable so hopefully the feedback will be taken in the appropriate vein. The building is very cool and the vibe was energetic on a sunny Sunday morning. There was an abundance of waiters but they seemed to be confused and frenetic without a real focus on the customer. The menu is very limited and our server had not eaten most of the items. He was struggling to explain. Our drinks took more than 15 minutes to arrive even though we saw them sitting at the bar for the entire time. Our water had just disappeared. Then the food. I ordered the grill cheese ( a rare treat and when I order it I want it good!). It was cold and overwhelmed by heavy bread. The cheese wasn't melted. I sent it back and they simply nuked it and brought it out. Icky. Our son wanted a kids cheeseburger and the staff kept coming back and forth not sure if there was a single burger or sliders for kids. It became comical after the third person came out. My husband ordered a salmon omelet with several additional fixings. The eggs tasted like box eggs and it was lackluster and flavorless. We even took the time to provide feedback to management but we got a weak smile and \"come back and try us again.\" He made no effort to \"make things right\" either by comping something else to taste or providing an incentive to come back. There are too many restaurants in town to have to go to one that is less than mediocre. The young crowd may enjoy it for the bar vibe it gives but the majority of the tables on Sunday am were families or middle aged and we saw similar responses at other tables."}
{"text":"Great place to cure a hangover.  Food is delicious, drink selection even better!  My most recent experience, my friends and I were taken care of by a very nice upbeat attentive girl. Place was packed but still had good service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's definitely one of my favorite football and brunch spots. If you decide stop in for brunch make sure you get there before 2pm so that you can take advantage of their great bottomless mimosas! The staff is great and remembers my friends and I whenever we come in, definitely a must go in Old Town."}
{"text":"Smoking hot bartender with firecracker wit - Check. Decent selection of beer - Check. Great food - Check.  Within a 5 minute walk to my hotel - Triple check.   Spent quite a bit of time at this joint during spring training this year watching the NCAA Tourney.  Great atmosphere, diverse crowd to bullshit with and the staff was really friendly.   All in all, I had a great time. This will be my go to place for day drinking next year when I'm not at a game."}
{"text":"Here now, watching them poor mimosas in a pitcher. It is 1/4 champagne, 1/2 oj, and 1/4 water.  It is a joke and they say that is what they are told to do. They say they ran out last week so..... Buy more and charge enough to cover.  I will not come back.   If I wanted watered down oj I would have ordered it."}
{"text":"Honey jalapeño chicken lollipops and sweet potato tots are probably some of the most delicious things ever."}
{"text":"Sunday football brunch was packed. Pulled pork hash with eggs was pretty good, but the highlight was the $15 bottomless Bloody Mary (had a bunch).   Lowlight was definitely the ghost waiter who never visited after taking our order unless we got another server to ask him or got up to look for him."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, once late at night and got some drinks and appetizers, another time with a big group for Sunday brunch.  It is packed for brunch on the weekends, they offer $15 bottomless mimosas or bloody mary's until 2 or 3, so everyone comes here to help cure their hangovers.  The food is just okay, don't expect anything special.  People mostly come here for the environment and the DJ."}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account just for this as I am sitting at the table. I ordered a water. Luckily, they got that right. A table had been left to be bussed for so long that an adequate amount of flies began to live on it. My friend ordered a pizza from local pizza shop and had it delivered before the wait staff even asked to take our food or der. When waitress did come over to check on us, she walked away while we were still talking to her. We did order drinks from this place and the waitress came over and told us we had to cash out because she was trying to leave. Then the register system must be super complicated because it took three of em to cash out one check. Waitresses try too hard to look cute. Waiters are cute tho. Just the right amount of stubbly facial hair. Mmhmm. But the wait staff is too into themselves to notice customers. I feel if i were to take one home, they would only watch themeslves in the mirrors around my bed. All in all, i would return because i enjoy the scenery and waiting for things gave me plenty of time to look around."}
{"text":"When you first open your doors for business it is imperative that you make a good and consistent first impression.  It is also critical that your staff is ready to open.  from what i saw and the other negative reviews it seems that they have failed horribly.   i went with my girlfriend for lunch today. entered the front door to a few employees that seemed a little confused, expected for first week.  we chose to sit outside on the bottom patio to do some people watching.  its a nice patio.  SIDENOTE. i just dont understand why there are so many patios build 4 feet away form the road.  scottsdale road is busy mid day and it can be a little irritating eating and drinking with exhaust fumes from city busses, loud hogs (choppers or motorcycles) ghetto people playing bad music too loud with their windows down, thinking they are hardcore, but then again its people watching.  ANYWAY  everything was fine until we ordered our food. a salad and ahi tacos. SMALL menu.  NOTHING exciting.  quite the boring menu.  i had higher expectations.  anyway ,after we ordered i asked if i could glance at the dinner menu, our server said \"yea i think i can find one of those.\"  when he returned empty handed 15 mins later to refill my soda, his response was that the dinner menu was still in the works and not yet available,  hopefully wednesday.  ok whatever.  he then says that the kitchen has had some issues and had to cut the tuna to order.  ok whatever i can kind understand that too.  however, i can personally cut and portion about ten pounds of ahi tuna in ten minutes by myself.  hopefully a fully staffed kitchen can handle a not very busy lunch, right?!?   wrong.  more time goes by and when our server returned to say our food was still not quite ready yet i told him we were leaving.  and we walked.  all in all we waited about twenty five minutes for a seared piece of tuna and a salad.  this should take about 5 minutes, 10 if your slammed.  if for whatever reson it takes longer a manager should stop by and show face.  there was nothing.  no concern from management.  i didnt even see one.  the server did seem genuinly apologetic and i left him some cash for the time in his table.  on our way back to the car we saw mission and, starving, we went there and had a great lunch.  sorry RnR but you screwed up.  you are clearly not ready for business and need to do some retraining.  i heard they had hired a quality exec chef and then fired him before opening.  the only thing you are good for now is an overpriced beer and overflow from the blue moose durring spring training.  maybe some ASU hunting grounds.  that seems fitting for what you have."}
{"text":"Good place to come for a sunday funday to watch sports and drink bottomless mimosas, fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went to RnR over our vacation and had Courtney as our bartender, she was super sweet and very attentive! We had a large group and she always kept our drinks filled and had a smile on her face :)  We appreciate the GREAT service and the delicious appetizers and will definitely be back! Thanks Courtney & the chefs @ RnR Scottsdale !  We are back in Scottsdale and decided to stop in for Sunday Funday at RnR and WOW who did we get?! Our favorite server/bartender Courtney and she is awesome as ever! It was 114F out today and we love stopping by our favorite place in Scottsdale. Thanks guys for the yummy food and awesome service as always !"}
{"text":"I came in a couple weekends ago for my birthday. I had called a few weeks prior and asked if I could make a reservation since I would have a larger party. The girl had told me yes as long as it was before the bottomless mimosas started. As it got closer to the date I called with my confirmed amount of guests and this time they told me I would have to pay $50 per person to make a reservation! So I decided to get there an hour before the mimosas started and put my name on the list. I was quoted an hour and a half for 14 people. Not a big deal so we waited... And waited...and waited. After about an hour and a half I had gone up to the host and asked where we were on the list. She said we were next.... I had told her at this point we just wanted to sit and eat and she could split us up if that would make it faster. Mind you there were 2 tables next to the host stand where the tables sat 6 but one had 2 people at it and another had just one guy! Why would they do that?! So we waited longer, and at this point some people had left. Then I go up again and she said no tables had gotten up except for 4 tops. I then again told her we were okay with getting split up. So she sat 4 of us right then. Cool finally after 2 hours 4 of us get to eat. Sit down and order our food. Our food comes and still no one else gets seated. I go to the bathroom and check with the host about the rest of the group and she said a 12 top is getting cleaned off and they are about to seat them. Yay finally! I'm now finished with my food and nothing has been done yet. Then the table next to us gets up and leaves... It was another 4 top. So I go up to the host and ask if she can seat the next 4 in my group and she says as long as a table is open I can sit them there. Cool yay after almost 3 hours... NOPE up walks 4 people I've never met. Im confused? So at this point I ask for the manager. I guess they just let anyone out of college become a manager now days. The guy was completely rude and told me it was the servers friends. Okay so after waiting 3 hours only 4 of my party of 14 is sat and if you know someone who works there you get to just walk on in and sit down?! And what happened to the 12 top that they were cleaning off? He then tells me I should of made a reservation. Oh that's hilarious because I tried! He did not once apologize and argued with me, yes he sat there and argued with me that their hosts have a system and he told me I just wasn't sober to understand!! I've worked in restaurants and I completely understand the system... I came to celebrate my birthday and I just wanted all my friends to be together which he also comments yeah so is everyone else here. Cool! I won't be back after this experience!!! A manager should never act like that to a guest. Oh and no one else got sat after."}
{"text":"We came here to watch the sports game. There are plenty of TVs and a projector screen, which is great! Unfortunately, the projector wasn't showing the game very well, as too much light was coming in.  Yay for happy hour drink and appetizer specials everyday! The food was pretty good, especially for the price. I'd recommend coming here to watch a game or happy hour. You'll have a good time!"}
{"text":"Came here today for brunch 9/19, the food was amazing as always I had the pork hash recommended by Kendall, it was awesome, my boyfriend built his own omelette it was great! Although the food was amazing the reason I'm giving 5 stars is because of the awesome service we got from the bartender Kendall! I work in a restaurant as a server and a manger and I would love to have someone like her working for me! She was amazing all around and has GREAT customer service skills!"}
{"text":"Music [sic] was so loud we couldn't hear the hostess asking us where we wanted to sit.  We decided to go outside because it was quieter out there.  We ordered or food, and for some insane reason they turned the weird computer generated noise up until they were satisfied that no one could possibly speak to anyone.  We (and another table) asked them to turn it down, but nothing was done, so we left before our food arrived.  If you have a brain injury or would like to become dumber and lose your hearing permanently, this would be a great place to do both.  If you want to enjoy weekend brunch without screaming across the table, go to Alo, which is where we ended up"}
{"text":"If people watching was a sport... id be an all star.   RnR is a great space to practice my peoplewatchin skills.  The patio is the only place to be.  Inside is just so so. On the patio you get a good mix of things to look at:  * Old Town regulars (People walking around this joint are pretty much Arizona's version of Jersey Shore.)   * Then you get your out of town dudes who stopped here after 18 holes and are now trying to nail 18 hoes.  Stop dude, your Titleist hat does nothing for these bitches... you need your GTL and blowout hair. Duh.   *  Then theres the bullit biker bar across the street. Thank goodness you put straight pipes and ape hangers on your 86 Harley, otherwise i might not have noticed how freaking awesome you are!  Keep the ZZ Top thing going, it really works for you Grizzly Adams.   The food is pretty tasty, the drinks arent bad.  They carry Effin vodka, many places dont, so thats a bonus.    First time i was here, someone at the bar asked if RnR was owned by the same people that own the Vig. Bartender said: no, but we get that question all the time.  Its similar in some ways, but wasnt sure why. Last time i was there, i figured it out!  The sink in the mens room is exactly the same as the one in Vig uptown... Its not yer average sink... orange, on a slant, very mod.  It stands out.   VIOLA!"}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed the place, food was average, service was average, and the drink prices were average. I came here for happy hour and the food prices were reasonable. The chicken lollipops are nothing more than chicken wings, if your going to try anything go with the French fry's covering in pulled pork and bbq sauce they were great munchie food.  The breakfast menu looked pretty good so I will have to come back and give it another shot."}
{"text":"Like Nathan M., this review is for the lack of service and not the food as we didn't make it that far.  My boyfriend and I came in yesterday afternoon for lunch.  The host was friendly enough, we sat at a table on the 2nd floor patio.  It really is a great looking place, open, industrial, \"hip\".  That is where the positives stop.  We waited about 15 minutes for our server to show up, who then took our drink order and ran away before we could say we were ready to order our food.   He seemed very disinterested.  10 minutes later my iced tea was dropped off hastily with no mention of my bf's beer, he said he'd be back to take our order as he was walking away from our table.  Another 10 minutes passed, still no beer and \"our server\" reappears to take our food order.   We asked to start with the artichoke dip, to which we were told \"we're out\".  I asked for a ceasar salad, the bf a burger.  After we ordered, we realized that the server didn't ask which side we wanted with the burger.  We both realized at this point that we just needed to get the hell out of there.  We dropped $3 on the table for my iced tea and headed to Sonic."}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews we had a different experience and found the service to be very good.  We were given a lot of recommendations, details on non-advertised specials and an IPad to sign up to their facebook page to receive info on specials in the future.    The food was good although not great.  Some items like the loaded chips were very tasty (although hold the blue cheese if you don't love that ingredient) while others missed like the chicken lollipops.  The drinks were good as the bloody mary's had the perfect spiciness level and the bacon condiment was a great touch.  The interior is very nice although I would say they have not made the full commitment to being a sports bar as they have a good number of tvs, but not quite the number you would want if you want to watch multiple at a time.  Overall this is a really good option in the area.  They have some kinks to work out but even still is a good experience for dinner, drinks or a game."}
{"text":"Went in on Monday night , 4/16/2012, around 8pm. Place was nearly empty but it took forever to get our food which was an RnR burger and a pulled pork sandwich. I ordered BBQ sauce on the side in case I didn't care for it but the pork itself was very spicy like it was marinated or cook with very hot peppers. It was kind of off putting.  My sweet potato fries were amazing. Some of the best I've ever eaten. Crispy and seasoned perfectly.  Boyfriend said burger was ok and his healthy side of berries were yummy. Had a singer for mellow Monday and she was very good but I can't tell if it wants to be a restaurant or hipster bar with some appetizers. Just ok if you want a nice dinner that's not a $50 steak"}
{"text":"This has got to be the most annoying place on Earth. I pray no 'Falling Down'-style grumpy guy goes in here for breakfast, because when he orders his food and the freaking techo-dance-whatever starts at 10am, he's going to lose it. I gave them 3 stars because the crazy fancy stuffed french toast was delicious for the first third or so. I mean crazy delicious. But then it started to just become disgusting. Too much sugary stuff, even without adding syrup. Like eating that low-end cake frosting that comes on grocery store cakes for an entire meal.  So if you like drunk people knocking into you while they order their bottomless mimosas and awful techno is your jam, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials.  All the appetizers are delicious!  Service is first rate and it's nice to sit outside on the patio.  Great people watching without being too obnoxious!  LOL"}
{"text":"This place is SO much fun! Especially on Sunday... Your time at this bar will only be amplified if you have Courtney as your server.  She is friendly and fun and made sure we were taken care of, thanks RnR and Courtney!"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable IF: you are there for a bachelor/bachelorette party, out with friends for a crazy brunch, or love mimosas/bloody marys/music.  If you want a low key brunch- this is not the spot for you.  We absolutely loved it- but we were there with 6 girls who wanted more atmosphere than good food for a bachelorette party.  Music is very very loud- so not the spot to sit and chat.  AND it was a Sunday.  Bottomless mimosas are unbelievable.   My food was great- but one girl didn't like her salad Only suggestion for this bar would be to get some slightly friendlier staff- that would have made the experience awesome.. but our waiter sucked."}
{"text":"Had the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, it was really good.  Great atmosphere so long as you like a busy, young crowd.  I went at 3:30pm on Sunday and went back again at 11:30pm Sunday night.  Got 1/2 off my check because it was after 11pm!"}
{"text":"I wish I could remember my waiter's name because he was absolutely amazing! He offered to blow up balloons for me for my birthday (and even allowed me to pick my colors ). Despite how busy it was he was very on top of things. Even when a mistake was made, he went above and beyond to not only correct, but more than make up for it! He created a spectacular experience for us and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Only gave this location one star because I had to. The service was subpar, however the icing on top of this horrible cake was the rude security guards. No better way to push business to other pubs than having overly aggressive security. A side note to anyone that doesn't fit the Snottsdale standard, you won't be welcomed here."}
{"text":"Great time on a Fall Saturday afternoon!  Good music, college football, and good looking people.  But...service could have been better."}
{"text":"This place would be worthy of a few more stars if their staff were competent enough to know what customer service is. Staff- you are paid to serve food and drinks to customers. You chose to work here, act like it."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is awful. People are dumb.   Literally, dumb.  #whiteinktatoosmeansbadatmath"}
{"text":"At 2pm, the strong maple syrup smell was unappetizing.  Beer list was weak.  Food selection was unimpressive.  Servers were dismissive.  I may feel different about this place on a sunday morning, which appears to be their string suit"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. However that is not the worst part. We were brought warm bud lights and we asked the waitress to please bring us cold beers and she said, \" it's not my fault.\" After that she ignored us and we literally had zero service. We couldn't even get our check. I will never go back."}
{"text":"The place was filled with your typical Scottsdale \"daddy's credit card\" young adults.  We had a party of 5 (including me), but the prices were so ridiculous that we decided to order 3 meals and share them.  Two fish taco meals and a sandwich.  The tacos were about the size of a hockey puck and had no flavor and the sandwich was soggy.  Not to  mention our server was a dumb blonde who couldn't get her beverages straight to save her life because she had also been drinking. On a positive note though, great location and interesting building for a restaurant.    But,  We left and won't try it again."}
{"text":"RnR was such a huge disappointment for me! We went here for breakfast after a night out on the town. Our server was probably one of the slowest I have ever had. It took forever for her to even bring water! Then the home fries were bland and claimed to have peppers and onions in them. I have literally one pepper and a couple pieces of onion. The bacon was actually good. I heard this place is fun at night but don't venture here for breakfast I would suggest."}
{"text":"Fun if you are looking for a loud, young, drinking, sports bar type crowd.  We went for breakfast and the food was good.  We had the egg white scramble, and the pulled pork hash total bill was $27.  Both had more food than we could eat.  Service was good. It's communal seating and a bit loud so having a convo is a bit hard. I think we would have enjoyed it more if we were with a group coming to watch a game."}
{"text":"The three stars are for the wonderful staff, if they hadn't been as attentive and personable, it would have been a 2-star review. The place has a cool look to it, inside-outside bar tables sitting right on a busy street in front of a bus stop. Don't sit at the table right on the sidewalk because the fast moving traffic is annoying - did I mention the bus stop? The food was nothing special, the salad with ahi was dry, either over cooked or just not fresh. The monster frys were something a teenag boy might throw together after school. I'm sure they are not trying to compete with the top-notch food choices in the area, unfortunately I just had those higher expectations for dinner this night. There are TV's everywhere and I'm sure its a great place to watch the game so I can't take that away from them.  If you are looking for Grub, Beer and the Game this place won't disappoint. Now I feel a little bad about my review, but I call it how I see it so 3 stars it is..."}
{"text":"Great place to watch TV... if you don't care about getting served. We went to RNR for a drink around 9 pm because we'd driven by it several times and it looked like a fun place. After being seated by a somewhat curt hostess, we were totally ignored by the waitstaff. She must have stuck us in the no service zone. Tried to flag down a couple different waiters as they sauntered by our table, but after 10 minutes we gave up and left. We have guests in town constantly but RNR took themselves off our list of places to take people to. Definitely deserve no stars but 1 is the minimum allowed."}
{"text":"Yikes. Came back to RnR this past weekend to give it another go, and it was close to disastrous. The hard part was that it wasnt the server, it was the food/drinks.   Drinks: I had to send my glass of prosecco back twice because it was flat. Now, I know prosecco does not have as many bubbles as champagne, but this was completely flat. Finally, I get a third glass that wasnt flat...but upon taking my first sip...it tasted like chardonnay with bubbles. SIck. Prosecco is supposed to be light, and dry with a little hint of fruit to it. What was that?   Food: We ordered a baked brie, spinach artichoke dip, and the truffle fries. The baked brie came out as being baked, and then falling cold. The spinach artichoke dip was more like soup, and the fries were lukewarm and soft. The server offered to have the baked brie put \"back through the salamander\", wherein I declined the offer. Really? Baked brie in a salamander? *Cringe*.   Overall the food and drinks were near terrible. Again, the server was really nice, and it definately wasnt her fault. The manager came by, noticing we didnt eat much of the food, and after telling him how things turned out he comped our entire bill. While that was nice of him, hopefully he came to the realization that he needs to hand the chef a red bull or something."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch and late happy hours.  Very chill atmosphere with unique ambiance.  Food is all above average to pretty good, and has some unique selections that you won't find elsewhere.  Great brunch atmosphere, and you can't beat the bottomless Bloody Marys and Mimosas.   Gotta love the bacon in the bloody mary by the way!   Live music at times throughout the week, and we like to head down on Thursdays for a chill drink our two around 8:30.   My only gripe is that their beer selection is very blasé and only offer the run of the mill bud light, miller light, coors light, etc..  A couple unique craft beers like IPA's and Hefeweizen's would be a nice match for their unique environment.  As a marketing guy, I love RnR's embrace of using social networks to market their product, and if you like RnR be sure to friend them on Facebook as they post good specials on a daily basis.   Must try:  Animal Fries, Chambord Margarita & Grilled Cheese Stay away from:  Beer Selection"}
{"text":"Stopped in at noon on Sunday. We'd always driven by the place and saw the packed tables and decided to stop for a cocktail. Beyond being the oldest person in the place, we still managed to have a good time. All you can drink mimosas and a rock star waitress named Tia made the stop worthwhile. Not for those seeking a quiet conversation but a great place to watch all the trendy wanabee's work their mating ritual!"}
{"text":"Tried it again for brunch after a bad first experience. The highlight came up front - the $15 bottomless mimosas & bloody marys.  The bloody was quite good.  Unfortunately, the food was not so good.  I had the pork hash with eggs & tortillas.  The hash was fine - nothing memorable or special.  The salsa was terrible - seemed straight from a jar, and a cheap jar at that.  Service was okay - nothing poor about it, but not helpful or particularly attentive.  I'll only be back if I'm in the mood for multiple bloodys & mimosas.    Overall, you're much better off at Daily Dose just down the street if you want a fun scene & much better food.  If you're willing to spend more, hit The Mission just a stones throw away, which is outstanding!"}
{"text":"No happy hour specials during Spring Training!   Came here after reading about the good Happy Hour specials, only to find they suspend them during Spring Training in order to gouge the tourists. They were also out of a couple of the better draft beers by 5:30 pm.  Not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"RnR gets a solid 3 stars in my book, and although there's not much to complain about here....there's not a whole lot to rave about either.  The place is done very nicely with lots of raw iron, and you can tell the Corieri's sunk some serious $$$ in the buildout (yes, same folks that own Axis-Radius, Suede, and Sandbar).  Thumbs UP:  -Nice selection of beers on tap -Above average bar fare--ahi tacos are delicious and have not once induced vomiting -Spacious patio  Thumbs DOWN:  -Sunsets + western exposure = untolerably hot patio much of the year--which is true with most patios in AZ.  BUT, if the patio isn't open the main bar becomes very crowded and tough to move around in -It has TV's...but not really the quantity, size, or placement to make it a top pick for sporting events -Service is inconsistent as I've had excellent and subpar experiences  I think the situation with RnR is that is struggles with an identity of what it truly is, be it bar, restaurant, sports bar, etc.  Because of this it's hard to get a feel for the place.  I would list it as a top spot for HH when you're looking for good eats, but wouldn't have it on my list solely for a meal or just a cocktail.  Jack of all trades and master of none?"}
{"text":"Awesome bar, amazing breakfast, staff was friendly and professional. I would highly recommend you visit RNR when visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had her nursing school graduation party here.....and she happens to be good friends with the sous chef.....so we go to try out almost the entire appetizer menu!   We were seated out on the upstairs patio, which was nice to be away from the big crowds, but was really, really far away from the restrooms! As the West sun began to set, it got a little hot, but then they put down the shades and the problem was solved!   The food just kept rolling out of the kitchen, my favorites were the crispy rock shrimp which had a kick to them, the mini pigs in blanket and the spinach artichoke dip. The pigs in the blanket were just your basic preparation, but how many places can you order these at a restaurant, and who doesn't dig pork and puff pastry? The spinach dip was creamy and delicious, but the chips could have been a bit better quality. We also sampled the cheese plate, all three kinds of sliders and the chicken lollipops.   We were stuffed at this point, but then came the platters of mini cheesecakes and carrot cakes....mmmm.   This is a cool new place in Old Town to hang out.....I will be back."}
{"text":"Flat water down (!) beer, old soggy fries and cold food, sticky (!) table and rude waiter. Apparently not a good night............. Stay away and try better local places than this dump."}
{"text":"Went here last week for dinner and was pleasantly surprised.  We walked in and the hostess was very friendly and informed us that there was about 10 minutes left on happy hour and that they had some great drink specials.  We went to the bar while waiting for a table, and were immediately served, even though it was busy, as it was Friday around 7pm.  We ordered 2 margaritas, which came out to $7 on happy hour.  Great start!  We then were seated shortly after.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with blue cheese, and it was very good.  The fries were great as well.  Not a gourmet burger, but very large and tasty.  Better than your average sports bar burger.  Service was very good as well.  We always had a full glass even when it was packed.  They even changed the game to UofA for the pac-10 championship when requested."}
{"text":"I have tried to like this place, I really want to, but after my second time here I won't be going back.  The food is good and they have decent beer on tap, that's why they get two stars, but the service is AWFUL.  You should not have to wait 10 minutes for someone to take your drink order, especially when it isn't busy and when the Suns are playing you should have that on TV, not hockey."}
{"text":"I will say that the weakest link in this restaurant is the maturity of the staff.  We went for lunch and asked to sit on the patio.  Most of the people we're eating but then they sat a large group right next to us that only wanted to drink and smoke.  I know smoking it allowed on the patio but since it wasn't the only table available AND the rest of us we're eating food I think they should have sat them a little farther away from us. Our order wasn't right but couldn't get the server to come back so we just let it go.  The food was great!  Had a few items from the small plates and then we had the bacon grilled cheese and the chicken sandwich.  Both very good.   My biggest complaint is that we we're ignored unless we we're actively looking around for someone and then snagged someone as they walked by.  I will try again as this place is still trying to find its way but service needs to be stepped up for sure."}
{"text":"After a Spring Traning game we walked out on the N. Scottsdale and hit RnR.  It's a nice place and with all those flat screens for the NCAA tourney we were sucked in.    Great place - nice decor - staff was friendly.  $3 HH beers and 1/2 off apps  had us there for hours.  Or wait, maybe it was the super cute bartender that had us there for hours? Ah, regardless - 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"This place is lame. We had a party of 11 we put our name in at 11:30 am, they said the wait was about an hour and 20 minutes and they would text us when we could be seated. It was on a Sunday and they were busy, I get it.  But they texted us 4 hrs later at 3:30 pm. Really you thought we were still waiting. What a joke."}
{"text":"This place looks really cute and inviting but once you walk in the door that all changes. The hostess is less than friendly and simply a little slow in the brain department. We were there on a Sunday morning but it wasn't too busy at all, there were plenty of open tables around us.  The staff is clearly less than happy to be there and could care less about serving you or checking up on you at all.  Very disappointing because the place has great potential.  Took 22 minutes to get my coffee and 45 minutes to get our order for 3 people. 45 minutes for pancakes? Come on! Minus one star.  Most of the dishes lacked sides. I ordered a side of bacon for $4, it was burnt and cold. Minus one star.   Food was mediocre, not bad, not exceptional. But the pancakes did get a sudden lardy flavor after they cooled a little, two of us noticed this. Minus one star.  One star for great atmosphere and ambience.  One star for the manager attempting to win back our patronage.  However, no one in my party will be back to this place. In fact, we rushed to request our check, pay cash and just get out of there.   Perhaps the bar atmosphere is different at night - when no one expects service."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal!! Service is really hit or miss."}
{"text":"This seems to be the place to see and be seen for the young and the trendy. It was always crowded when we walked by, but the blasting music and stylish crowd at night made it a tough sell for many of my coworkers. So, I went on my own, opting to stretch my per-diem to the max at happy hour.  It was love at first sip of that black IPA on draft. Then there was the ahi tuna tacos. These dainty little tacos come out on a seemingly silly slice of jicama, almost too pretty to eat. But I checked my ego and ate them whole, and was immediately blown away by the fresh, bright flavor. This was a big deal for me, as I typically avoid eating fish in land-locked states. Impressed, I also ordered the burger sliders. Sadly, they were dry and an overall disappointment.  With those tuna tacos still on my mind, the table was set for a second visit. For round 2 I opted for a more manly snack: the animal fries. Snack? This proved to be more of a meal. And lets be honest - this dish is nothing less than food porn, the likes of which I used to fantasize about as a collegiate stoner. A plate of not 1 but 3 kinds of already-bad-for-you fries, topped with a mound of hearty pulled pork and smothered with 2 kinds of melted cheeses and bbq sauce. Believe me, It was even more awesome than it sounds, even if the cheese was a bit sharp for my taste.  So then I saw the breakfast menu online, and imagined curing a Sunday morning hangover with some breakfast tacos. Fast forward to that weekend - Im not exactly sure what happened St Pattys day/night, but when I woke up Sunday am, RnR was packed with a solid1.5-2 hr wait. Needless to say, I never got the chance to sample breakfast. Alas, there will be another trip in a few months, and Ill be back."}
{"text":"Patty melt was delicious and portions were just right, not too large - not too small."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday today here. Great service. Our server, Cassidy, hands down theeeee best server I ever had. I feel like a new man. I used to be an alchoholic, but after her supreme service it inspired me to go to AA meetings and stop drinking. Her service was life changing. Since then, I've gone back to school and got my masters. I would highly suggest coming here to change your life."}
{"text":"Got to love the bottomless mimosas and live DJ for Sunday funday! The service is friendly but maybe a bit short staffed for some Sundays. It's the only day of the week I've been there, but it's always packed with a true party atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks... Sunday's are the best but get pretty wild. Bottomless mimosas are the best part & always make for a good time! The staff is friendly even though it can get pretty busy on the weekends.  Make sure to arrive before 11am if you want a table."}
{"text":"WOW! The burgers here are beyond excellent. I was seriously surprised. Really, really good. Did I mention the burgers are really good. WOW!  And the craft beer is excellent. I chose the Lifted Kilt. It was very good.  Lots of TV's lots of sports.   Stop in if you're in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! The atmosphere is a blast and the food is amazing! Brunch is my favorite and with bottomless mimosas you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Great time here today/tonight. Great atmosphere, live music Tuesday & Wednesday. Dirty chips were awesome. Garrett was our server, he was amazing the entire time we were here. Definitely well be back. Great stop on a great first date."}
{"text":"I came in for a quick happy hour drink and togo order. MATT behind the bar was awesome. Made my drink perfect, put on the NFL game for me, and informed me about the happy hour specials like a pro.. Please give this guy kudos for being a great representation of your company! I will be back."}
{"text":"As a Rockies fan in a Giants type o'place!  I truly enjoyed it.  We sat on the patio and we sat for quite sometime.  We could had drank the bar dry, but we left some!  I would suggest this place!"}
{"text":"The hostess and waitresses were on point. I ordered the sliders and the burgers were dry and the bread had a funny taste as if it had been sitting out. My side salad had no taste even after attemting to add salt. My house chardonnay was okay considering it was $10 a glass. The food is terrible and over priced. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"So, the staff was more interested in having a conversation amongst themselves while the place was slow.  And check your prices because when I asked how much I owed for my beer the bartender said $5 but rang in $4 probably pocketing the rest and the tip I gave her.   This place is hit or miss and after seeing the $4 beer when she told me $5...  Principles."}
{"text":"Worst bar I have ever been to. Channel selection was terrible, bartenders rude and dumb, and it took forever to get some wings (1.25 hours). Bad impression for Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I use Yelp regularly to find new places in the area, but I have never written a review until now. I feel compelled to let upper management or whoever handles complaints know that the early afternoon staff clearly needs to be watched a little closer. Our server, a tall blonde named Valentina seemed utterly annoyed that she had to put her phone down to come greet us at the table. After we ordered and received our food we noticed our drinks were empty and she didn't come back to the table until we were already finished eating. That's a HUGE service no no by any standard. RnR you get 2 stars and not 1 because the food was pretty good and maybe we would have had a better time/better service if we sat at the bar instead of a table getting ignored by our server who was too busy texting and flirting with the male staff. It was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great for industry night! I enjoyed everything I tried even if it wasn't unforgettable, and it was a great place to watch a little Monday Night Football. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Sunday football and a DJ don't mix! I ventured in to watch football on Sunday - tons or TVs and people all decked out in team attire. The service was iffy - had to ask for menus a few times after being seated, server seemed totally overwhelmed and forgot to put in our order and the unlimited bloody mary's would be cool if you could actually get them from the bar.  My biggest complaint is by far that they don't have an identity on Sundays. Every time the customers' cheered, the DJ increased the bumping. Not fun, they need to choose a scene and stick to it."}
{"text":"We had a huge group and several forms of payment, our server Shelby was a rockstar! So sweet and accommodating!   Amazing brunch. I recommend: Southwest Burger, Hangover Fries and the Cinnamon Roll. And definitely do the bottomless Mimosas/Bloody Mary's-- such a good deal.  I loved it here! Such a fun atmosphere and amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. I went in on a Wednesday night and while everything else in Old Town was shutting down it was open and pretty busy.  You can sit outside and even inside is pretty open which I liked. Servers are really nice too. The reason I gave it two stars is because I ordered the Bruschetta. It was disgusting. Not only did it taste bad and the cheese taste old but it was oily. Made me sick for the next 12 hours. Burgers looked good though but I didn't have a chance to try it."}
{"text":"I was super excited to check this place out because from the outside it looks like a blast. Tiered up in rot-iron pillars there has got to be like three levels to this place. We  had a fairly large group and went for mimosa brunch hour on a Saturday. I was told it was $14 bottomless mimosas so I didn't order food, plus I wasn't hungry. The waiter seemed slightly overwhlemed with the size of our group but they food came out quickly and everyone seemed pleased with their dishes. The place was refreshingly cool and swamp misters kept the outside diners relieved as well. The crowd was all types and I experienced that in the bathroom toom which looked like it belonged in a campground, but oh well.  Turns out you only get the $14 bottomless deal if you order food... so basically they want you to spend at least $23 on brunch. I dunno, doesn't seem like that great of a deal. I would go back if it truly was a flat $14 bottomless deal or if someone else was paying for me."}
{"text":"Great location, friendly engaging staff. The service however was a bit slow, which makes me wonder if that's the reason my burger and fries arrived a bit on the cold side. The only reason I didn't say anything was becAuse I was starving and went here after a 5 hour flight and hotel check-in. Other than that they had a DJ and night and good drink specials."}
{"text":"Service is non existent Bartender was more interested in the waitress with the great rack, I don't blame him. Nice rack"}
{"text":"Disgustingly racist establishment.    My boyfriend was denied entrance because of his basketball shoes.   I heard about the \"unreasonable dress-code\" of this area (to put it lightly) but the fact that they let me right in without a problem is my argument: I had on the same exact pair of shoes on!   The bouncer had the nerve to tell us every bar on that street was going to have the same rules. We walked across the street to another restaurant and had zero problems.   My boyfriend and his friend had the idea to switch shoes and try to enter here after an hour or so following our first encounter and he was let in without any problems. After a few choice words were exchanged, the bouncer must have felt pretty stupid for getting caught and said, \"Your friend can come back and get in, my boss just told me I can lighten up on the dress code.\"   By the way, what is your argument with high top converse? Last time I checked, that is the original basketball shoe."}
{"text":"Great music food and the $15 mimosa special is incredible on weekends! I recommend the grilled cheese, Brussels sprout burger and Mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"Went in with a group on Monday around 1pm. The place wasn't busy at all, so I was expecting service to be pretty speedy. WRONG! We waited almost 10 minutes for our drinks to be delivered. One persons drink didn't even come, so after another 10 minutes of our server being nowhere, he magically appeared and ordered him another one. 5 minutes later, I personally had to go grab it from the bar because our server was nowhere to be found again.   after ordering, it took about 35 minutes for our food to come out. A buddy and I split the Blue Cheese Sliders and the Hangover Fries. The sliders came out with no blue cheese on them and the fries looked and tasted like they had been sitting under the heat-lamp for about 10 minutes. And again, our server was nowhere to be found when we needed drink refills and to ask about the food.   To top it off, a few in our group decided to sit at the bar after our meal and wait for our ride to come. We all ordered beers from their amazing CRAFT selection (Coors Light, Blue Moon, Dos Equis, Alaskan Amber, New Castle, Perroni). Wow, those all sound like domestics to me.   As we were drinking our beers, we noticed that the bar was swarming with FLY's! EVERYWHERE! Flies and Gnats were on everything; the plates, glasses, bottles, the beer taps.   This place is to be avoided at all cost. It may look good on the outside but everything on the inside is messed up. This is coming from someone who has worked a while in the food industry.   Service - 1.5/5 Food - 2/5 Cleanliness - 1.5/5 Atmosphere - 3/5"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a saturday. After passing this place all the time we decided to give it a try. I gotta say, the food was just OK. Nothing on the menu looked appetizing to me...so I ended up ordering the sliders (1 of each sliders they had on the menu). They came out dry...and the sauce that came with it was not good. It was kinda BBQ-y, kinda asian-y, and very oily. It was bizarre. My bf ordered the BLT with avocado which he says was pretty good. Garlic fries were supposed to come with his meal but we got cold regular fries that had no flavor. Yuck! On the other hand, service was great!"}
{"text":"I only chose one star because there wasn't one lower...  They had about 15 employees standing around doing nothing but judging people. One guy who plays on a Mimosa softball (??) team who the bar staff were chatting with grabbed a bar straw and dipped it in one of our group's Lemondrop and TASTED IT!?!?!\" Oh, and we're pretty sure the Lemondrop had zero vodka in it!    The staff were totally judgmental and obviously homophobic!  There was a total lack of respect in the place by employees and guests!   What a disappointment!  We were planning to eat dinner there also but requested the check as soon as our drinks came. Oh....  And USUALLY we are great tippers!  Bummer for the employees at RnR!   Super sad...  And disappointing!"}
{"text":"I live in the area so I was excited when I saw this place being built - it's a cool modern building with patios on both floors. I'd heard complaints from my friends about the service and food but decided to try it anyway. When I walked in I was greeted by two friendly hostesses and the inside is as cool as the outside very open and well thought out.  Service - I decided to grab a seat at the small bar outside (maybe 10 seats) and grab a drink while I was waiting for a friend. For 5-7 minutes I watched the bartender repeatedly walk by she was helping waitresses but never acknowledged me. I would have left but I was waiting for a friend - I grabbed a table on the patio instead. After another 5 minutes of waiting a waiter finally took my drink order. He brought it in a reasonable amount of time but when my friend arrived she had to wait 10min for a drink too. The rest of service for our visit was acceptable.  Food - We tried the artichoke dip which was average but I think the chips were store bought and then heavily salted. I like salt but whoa hold back a little.  Bill - I thought the bill was too high for the service and food.  $5.55+tax for a draft Fat Tire(pint) and $9 for the artichoke dip. Although I would have no problem with that if the service was good and the food was above average. Not yet  I hope they can turn the place around. They did a great job with the design but need to work out the flaws in service and improve the food or lower the prices. It'll be a few months before I try it again - hopefully it will be under new management or have their issues worked out by then."}
{"text":"We had our corporate holiday party here. They housed 30 of us. The service was fantastic and food was delish. I was worried we might be cold on the patio but it was fine. There were heaters and plenty of space. The view was nice. The food was fresh and served buffet style. We didn't run out of food and everyone was pleased. We decided on the jalepeno mac n cheese, chicken lollipops,  sliders and shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Service was attentive but not hovering. Really enjoyed our meal and the upbeat atmosphere."}
{"text":"I honestly forgot how much fun this place is. It used to be my Sunday Funday spot but I've been living under a rock and haven't been out in ages. RnR has the best Sunday day-drinking spot in old town. Oh and their brunch is fab too. Bottomless mimosas are always a bonus in my book. I just wish I lived closer so I could just stumble home instead of cabbing it all the way back to north phoenix. Honestly though, when my friends are in town this is def the spot I will be taking them to show them what scottsdale Sunday fundays are like!"}
{"text":"Great bar on Sundays and even better during the week. Came with a large group on a Tuesday and they were more than accommodating. Big thanks to our waitress Erika who got everyone situated."}
{"text":"The outside of the building caught my attention as I was walking through Old Town.   This place has plenty TV and they are willing to show most games.   I was able to watch the 2015 draft and the NBA playoffs while having fresh parmesan fries and a cocktail! Nothing better."}
{"text":"Ashley P. was awesome! Me and my sister were having lunch here on Saturday and she took great care of us, she told us to head over to bottled blonde afterwards! We had a lot of fun!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. The service was absolutely terrible. We could not get our server to come around and pay any attention to us. We ran out of water, had questions, requests, etc., but could not get our server to come back to our table. He did not introduce himself, making it difficult to communicate with him. He even walked by us multiple times and seemed to completely ignore us.   I give this two stars for the expediter who seemed to be doing more work than the actual server. The expediter was very friendly, introduced himself to us as Carlos. He brought us water, answered our questions, etc. The serving staff seems to be far too self involved to actually care about their staff."}
{"text":"Erika was so nice and handled our large rowdy table of 12 like a boss!  The beer list and menu rocked. I'm still salivating over those pork sliders and Mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Good concept, pooor service. I wish I could give this place another chance but I'm only here for the weekend... My bday weekend."}
{"text":"Just sat for 20 mins and waitress was too busy chatting to take our order; despite the place being almost empty. Dropped some cash for our coffees and walked out."}
{"text":"I typically check the health rating of any establishment before going. In regards to RNR I suggest you do the same.   Shit bar. Shit music. Shit staff. Literal shit food.  Do yourself a favor. Avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"I have been to RnR a couple times.   Once during the NBA finals/happy hour. It was easy to get a good seat in front of a tv, the waiter was super friendly and the drink specials and food were pretty good. Nothing to really write home about.  Then I went to RnR for brunch and the waffles with apple butter has put this place on my Fav Breakfast Places list. Not only did it taste amazing but the portion size was perfect and it looked damn pretty. If only the mimosa price there was pretty, doesn't everybody have cheap mimosas?"}
{"text":"I love this place! The patio is amazing, especially if you get one of the end lounges to watch your game:). I have never had a bad meal here and I love the drink selection. Yes the music is loud for daytime, but it's still fun and usually has a unique crowd.   A must visit if you are new to the area or looking for a fun, funky place."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a beer and burger. The brunch is so so and a little overpriced. I have gone 2 times and have left fairly satisfied each time."}
{"text":"So I had some reservations about this place according to the reviews. Since they were all over the place had to see for myself. We went on a wednesday morning about 10:30, greeted and served promptly, ok great start. Between 4 of us we ordered and all tried the Chambord Fr. Toast, mmmm like angel cake, Vanilla Pancakes, just ok, 3 taco plate, good, but you must get the buscuits n gravy and add 2 over easy eggs on top!! Our boy server was pleasant, didn't catch his name. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Took a trip out of the cold with my girlfriend, and decided to stop by for happy hour. We had the animal fries for an appetizer. I had the renown bacon brussel burger and my girlfriend had the southwest chicken salad. Both were made to taste like perfection. Our server, Alina, was very attentive and kept the drinks coming. The gentlemen who ran us our food made sure we had everything we needed. Didn't catch his name but he did mention he was from New Jersey. All in all great service , even better food; we will be back again."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is great, the food is delicious. Weekend days are crazy and fun for their brunch which includes bottomless mimosas. Great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Good place for brunch. The food has always been good and the bottomless brunch drinks are a must. The music is good, but a bit loud. It's hard to have any sort of conversation. Certainly not a place for kids. Lots of drinking going on. We've never had to wait long to be seated. I prefer downstairs area, better for people watching. The staff has almost always been nice and attentive."}
{"text":"What a great location for Happy Hour when it isn't searing hot to sit on the patio. Sunday brunch is pretty fab here too since they used to have bottomless mimosa's. Try the Ahi taco's for Happy Hour!  The staff is pretty attentive once you get a table but it rubs me the wrong way when high school hostesses act as if you are an inconvenience or pretending they work at a club"}
{"text":"Jimmy is the best server around! We just moved here from California and it's our first time here at RNR-and we were provided with the best customer service! Jimmy went out of his way to make sure our experience was spectacular! Very accommodating, professional, and personable! Jimmy deserves a raise. Be like jimmy. We want jimmy!!!"}
{"text":"Went to RnR to watch the Hawks lose to Ohio State yesterday... (boo to that).   We were directed to a PERFECT patio seat right away and the server had no problem changing the flat screen to ABC so we could see our game. The seating is really comfty, great for enjoying a nice day, a few bevs and a football game.  The food was totally mediocre in my opinion... we split the dirty chips and wow-zaas... they were over the top (but I guess that's the concept so kinda my fault here). They came out looking awesome - great presentation, but after a few bites I was spent. It's the kind of food that sticks with you all day and you think about them later in the day and get totally grossed out. I would NOT have these again, but Matt probably would.  We split the RnR burger which was just OK too.  I'd love to try this spot for breakfast, some of the dishes passing by us looked pretty delish. I'd also like to try their salads.  All in all, I think this is the kind of place you go for the great patio on a beautiful, not necessarily the food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice while visiting AZ and all-in-all it's pretty good spot. Lot's of TV's, decent food. Really nice ambiance.  RnR get's a one-star because the server gave herself an additional $3 tip on my bill that I probably wouldn't have caught if I wasn't expensing the meal for business and kept my receipts. That is just COMPLETELY unacceptable behavior for a restaurant and I wonder how often she's done this to other patrons.   When I called they said they would credit my card back but offered no apologies or recourse for the server in question (Ashley M).  If I'm running a restaurant any server caught stealing tips from patrons would be fired on the spot. Plain and simple. It's a huge breach of trust."}
{"text":"So, getting straight to the point, I subtracted 2 stars purely due to service. Our server was pretty inattentive and seemed uninterested in our table upon our arrival... it was almost too obvious.   After a Sunday of day drinking, my party of 5 decided to go to RnR for a quick hangover remedy--\"Hangover Fries\". I opted for the Animal Fries, which were absolutely delicious & just what I needed. My boyfriend could not get his hands off my plate. So, they each got their orders: sliders, a couple of hangover fries and a Bleu Cheese burger prepared MEDIUM.   We waited about 15 minutes for food in the lull period of the day. No prob.  My friend's burger was definitely prepared Well. No pink at all. And when addressed, our server said, and I quote, \" I don't eat burgers, so I wouldn't know.\"   Now, she said that not meaning to be funny, but we thought it was a hilarious scenario being that she works at a gastropub that SERVES burgers and meat. Super confused to how she even works there if she feels so strongly.   Anyways... food was not bad, overall. I loved my Fries... Consensus for the Hangover Fries... nice. Sliders... dry. But the burger was definitely questionable.   If I go again, I'll hit the bar for a to-go order."}
{"text":"Service was great, loved our drinks and the animal fries but we got so confused when our server came out wearing a different outfit midway through our evening here. Kind of weird, didn't know we were at such an upscale dining establishment ;)"}
{"text":"went for breakfast - and i am SO NOT a breakfast person - but the protien pancakes i had were the BESTest pancakes (and i pretty much ahte pancakes) i have ever had!  wow - Y U M !! granola and oatmeal and everything good for you.  guys totally luved the taco /salsa /potaoe / bacon / egg breakfast pates - they were very yummy - all cooked and presented just right.  i do have to say that drinks took about 45 mins or so to arrive at the table, but what everrrrrrr....  our waiter was very nice and polite - wasn't his fault that the milk was sour in the choclate milk or the bloody mary had to be harvested from the vine 1st -  or the champange splt had to be shipped in from Cali ....  he was still cool :-)  i would def. like to try again and ck out happy hour and wine list - why not?"}
{"text":"Came for a friend's birthday and really was not that impressed. First of all, it took us a while to find parking as this place only has street parking and a few spots in back. On Saturday if you are there before 7pm, all alcohol was 1/2 off and some appetizers were on special. We ate dinner there and the menu was very limited. The food was okay, but our burgers were over cooked. The service was slow and it took us a while to get our check. I'd go to hang out again and have a few drinks, but I wouldn't suggest making this your regular hang out."}
{"text":"The food isn't all that. I order an Ahi Salad, which was barely touched. On the other hand, the chicken Popsicle my friends ordered were quite delightful. all in all, that atmosphere was surely enjoyable."}
{"text":"I'm not a food critic by any stretch of the imagination, but with that being said this place aspires to be mediocre.  And that's saying something for Scottsdale.   The bar/patio/lounge have this industrial design thing going on which isn't that bad until you add in the music and the noise from Scottsdale road.    The prices are what you would expect to find in a \"trendy Scottsdale bar\" the problem is at most of those \"trendy Scottsdale bars\" you can get pretty good food and it's worth it, and normally there is some little twist that makes it worth it.  I can honestly say I've never paid $13 for a pork sandwich that tasted like it was KC Masterpiece mixed with recently thawed shredded pork (the sandwich lived up to the rest of bar is aspired to be mediocre).   The meal came with the choice of fries (regular/parmesan/sweet potato) I took the parmesan fries... I couldn't taste any hint of parmesan on the fries but there were white specs that I suspect were the parmesan in question.     The wait staff was attentive, but they were either very new or indiffrent.    While eating I saw multiple plates go back with food that wasn't even half eaten.  I literally watched the table behind me get their food and have it sent back less then three minutes and two bites later.   So aspirations of mediocre are as good as it gets here.   If this place survives the summer I will be impressed.  Do your self a favor and go a block in either direction and find a better \"trendy Scottsdale bar\" you will be happy that you did."}
{"text":"The service is great and its a really fun atmosphere!!  The food is great, the only complaint I have is that it is a little over priced for sandwiches, even though they are very good.  Happy hour and deals on facebook are awesome!  I've had their famous Chambourd french toast there and was not very impressed, but lunch and dinner are VERY GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"RnR strikes me as a casual, urban place to meet up for drinks and a bite to eat. It's not what comes to mind when I think old town Scottsdale, but places like this popping up are helping to change my mind about the area. Unfortunately after I was finished I was reminded that it's still old town when I walked by a pan flute band on Main St.  The old town parking corral is directly behind RnR, you can get to it from the alley next to RnR or off of 2nd Street.  The space has a refreshing, industrial feel. I was impressed by the thought put into the seating options. Inside mostly features traditional high top tables for four, but I noticed they had a table near the bar that could seat at least 12. The downstairs patio features another bar, and both table and lounge chair seating. The upstairs patio has the best date seating, lots of tables for two.  There was a lot of staff working during my visit. The host was friendly, and my waiter was attentive. My water was never empty and I got my sandwich in under 10 minutes. If anything they were a little too eager to please. I was both impressed and bemused when my waiter refilled my water glass, apparently noticed my ice had mostly melted, then returned with a scoop of ice to add to my cup.  I just got a grilled cheese (which includes tomato and bacon) on my visit, I had dinner plans later but I was interested in feeling this place out. I really enjoyed it. The bread is cut pretty thick, which made me a little nervous. But it had a wonderful texture, and after a few bites I decided it worked for me and didn't overpower the delicious sharp cheddar and bacon like I expected.  I look forward to returning to try other meals, and to sample what the bar has to offer. I understand RnR will have both late night hours and breakfast service. This is a great place to visit any time of day, but I'm excited about having a new, good place I can frequent after (or during) a night out."}
{"text":"Really good, and fantastic service. Best meal we had on our trip!!  The protein pancakes are AWESOME, as are the animal fries and chicken tacos.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ate the RnR burger there for lunch and it was one of the better burgers I've had. On the messy side but good. The bacon they use is good quality thick cut that isn't too greasy or salty. The meat is on the thick side so I ended up eating about 2/3rds of it. I got the half and half sweet potato/normal fries and they were ok. The only negative was that it took a while to get the food.   It seems like a bar hangout at night."}
{"text":"This place was a blast!  I came here with 8 girls on a Saturday for some bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's and we were not disappointed!  We did have to wait about an hour since we were a large group, but we started on our drinks at the bar and the staff checked up on us several times and apologized for the wait.  Very friendly! The place was so fun, we didn't mind the wait.  There was a DJ and it was packed with a fun group of people!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Its very laid back and great to watch an afternoon football game and have a burger. The RNR burger is very nicely made and delicious. The queso and chips appetizer is also very good, queso was unique and tasty. The staff was very nice but we waited about 10 minutes to be greeted by our waiter."}
{"text":"Looove this place! Especially on Saturday and Sundays. Breakfast is so good. I would suggest breakfast taco plate or build your own burrito. The bottomless bloody mary/mimosa special on the weekends is probably the best deal. They literally never let ur glass get empty. Plus, there is a dj...need I say more? It's hands down the best time I've had at 10am"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food, bottomless mimosas, and our server Sydney was awesome! She was on top of everything and helping out other Co workers too! Thank you!"}
{"text":"WOW - maybe I'm too old or we weren't dress up enough but with a bunch of empty tables we were told there would be a 20 min wait - there was. Our server ignored us for the next 20 mins since we asked for the happy hour menu. Too bad cause the food was a little better than ok. We asked about the bottomless mimosas and were told there was only  half hour left and it wouldn't be worth our time. OK so what do I want to eat, great swami who knows all......"}
{"text":"My girl Elatisha - the one you want serving you! Awesome place, bottomless mimosas on Sunday Funday, and awesome food! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited Scottsdale and stopped in on the way from the airport to our hotel for a bite to eat. We sat outside, which was great! The prickly pear margarita is just what I had a taste for, and the chicken tacos were fantastic. Will definitely stop in here again."}
{"text":"A passionless bar. When we asked the server what kinds of beer they served, she pointed to the menu and told us it was on there. Lack of server training and messy halls with garbage bins and chairs make this place suitable for little more than a shot and a beer. Gaggles of servers hung together chatting and chewing gum. Beverages were overpriced at night."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for brunch, it was a 30-45 min wait (even though the bottom floor was nearly empty). The actual wait ended up being about 20 minutes.   We got our drinks right away, can't beat a $15 bottomless mimosa special. But my friend had to hunt someone down more than once to refill her coffee/water.   The server took our order right away but after 35 minutes we were wondering where our food was. He forgot to put in the order & we ended up waiting another 15 minutes. By the time our food came it was cold (French toast & breakfast sandwich).   The food wasn't that great, but it also wasn't too pricey...definitely not worth the long wait & feeling completely ignored.   Oh and someone dropped a plate with meat while clearing a table behind us. Glass & food was all over the floor for about 20 minutes, even though members of the staff were walking over the plate to get back inside.   Won't be coming back or recommending to friends."}
{"text":"We went to Scottsdale for Spring Training a few weeks ago.  We saw they had the Giants flags outside so we went in to have dinner.   The service was great from the lady at the first door to the lady who wanted on us.   We decided to have the \"Animal Fries\" and it ended up being all we could eat.  They were great but the BBQ sauce was a little hot and burned my lips.  But it was worth it. Sooooooooo Good.  The only thing they couldn't do was do a virgin drink for us so we ended up have diet coke with cherry favor in it.  But all in all it was a great time and I would go back."}
{"text":"Depends 150% on who your waiter is.  Sometimes bottomless mimosas are full price $25 and sometimes they're $15- has nothing to do with ordering \"entrees\" FYI.  The girls answering the phones need a lesson in how to be courteous but everyone else seems nice.  Decent atmosphere if you can sit far away enough from the music."}
{"text":"Went to RnR when visiting my friend in Phoenix. We went for the fun Sunday brunch environment and we weren't disappointed. The DJ played great music if you love 90's throwbacks, its definitely targeted toward the Millennial crowd for Funday Sunday. Our server was super on top of the bottomless mimosa situation, I don't think my glass was ever empty which is probably the first time that has ever happened to me at any restaurant. On top of all that, the food was amazing. I ordered the Chambord French toast which was cooked to perfection. The crème that it came with had plenty of flavor so no need for syrup. I would highly recommend coming here if you're looking for a great environment that has it all!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girl on Valentine's Day for some pre-dinner drinks. Cassidy proved herself to be a fantastic server who was very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this place for good drinks on a great price. Look for her because she was a phenomenal server to us ."}
{"text":"RnR Restaurant- 3737 N Scottsdale Rd, Scottsdale, AZ  This outdoor / indoor 2 story of Brohood heaven is a recovering Frat boy's wet dream! Came here for their dj bottomless Champagne Sunday brunch. The wait for a table was long as the house was PACKED  with mid and late 20 year olds chugging down on the bottomless champagne, that along with a brunch entree came to an affordable $15.. $25 without an entree. However, don't let the loud music and tiny bopper drinking binge fool you. The burgers and bar food here is banging!  The burgers are good enough to gain thumbs up from the most elitist of burger snobs! Came here with a party of 4. We ALL  were very happy with our food- 4 various burgers. The jalapeño mac n cheese was worth every hot sexy spicy cheese loaded calorie. Great diet cheat day detour! Loved the food! Not a fan of the service tho!  In all fairness,  they were absolutely slammed! Yet is this ever really an excuse.  Come here for a sunny Sunday Funday with your fun friends!  Not family friendly for brunch by no means.  #azrestaurant #whereToEat #azFood #Phoenix #az #Scottsdale #phoenixEats #brunch #azBrunch #goodEats #sundayFunday #dayParty"}
{"text":"Great hangover food. Huge burgers and good atmosphere. Not the best in cocktails but good in wine and beers. Sports fan this is a good place! Tons of TVs everywhere."}
{"text":"It's a little loud in there, but overall the happy hour was great. Very reasonable and good drinks."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and have never been disappointed! The food here is great, definitely try the chicken lollipops or the breakfast tacos. They have the best bottomless mimosa Sunday's in Scottsdale! If you've never been - you're missing out. Last time we were in for reverse happy hour Erika was great! She was friendly, upbeat and made our dining experience excellent! Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday morning for brunch.  The service started off not great, with us having to constantly remind our servers about things they forgot.  However, as the morning went on they got much better.  The bottomless mimosas are a great deal.  The food is nothing special.  And is anyone really in the mood for a DJ on a Saturday or Sunday morning?"}
{"text":"Great food, and good service... I was scared away from drinking there when a group of people were arguing with their server about their bill... Still like cocktail mixing fees and misc drink fees..."}
{"text":"Went this past Friday, food good, Old Fashions were great, server Bret was good.  RESTROOMS SMELLED LIKE THE PUCKS THEY PUT IN THE URINALS, NASTY! Told the manager and he gave me attitude.  And what's up with the wannabe gangsters?! REALY!? In South Scottsdale? Chains, saggy pants, walk with a \"limp\" do we REALY want that element around and all the baggage it brings. If that's the way this place is going ill take my business up the road or across the street.  And get a manager who give a shit about customers and who's not there just to flirt with the ladies.  Don't care how good the food or drinks are, they need to get their shit together, my opinion is to avoid it, plenty of other good places real close by."}
{"text":"This place has a cool atmosphere but staff is a little in over their heads. Waited 15 minutes for the hostesses to even acknowledge us, they literally had a conversation amongst themselves and then decided to help us when it worked for them.   It took awhile for our food to come, even though we told them we knew what we wanted when we sat down.   Food is good overall."}
{"text":"Loved RnR. I went last Sunday around 12. There wasn't that long of a wait and they have bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $14. Even though it was packed the servers were quick to refill. Fun atmosphere and a nice patio with an upstairs!"}
{"text":"We've dined here many times over the past couple of years and for the most part have enjoyed it.  Last night it was a little off.  DJ on the patio was good but the music was way too loud and the service was slow.  Not sure why but the ASU Game was nowhere to be found on any of their tv's?  We've had pretty much all of their apps by now and quite a few of their sandwiches so here are our faves:  Lollipop Chicken App - Really tasty, careful with the spicyness! Animal Fries - Awesome combination of fries and meat make this a don't miss. Dirty Chips - Nice alternative to the fries, bleu cheese crumbles really make this dish. Grilled Chicken Sandwich - Wow, so many great flavors going on with this one.  Pair it with their Sweet Potato Tots for a solid choice."}
{"text":"1 star is being generous. I am 23 years old from California with a valid ID that expires in 2016. I put my drink order in and the waitress said that she is not allowed to serve me due to new state laws the require my ID to be horizontal.   We asked to speak to the manager, Cassandra Bentley. Cassandra gave me the same explanation regarding my California ID. Cassandra refused to serve me so I asked how many drinks one person can order at a time- she replied two. I told her my friend will then order my drink for me. Cassandra said \"DO WHAT YOU WANT\" and THREW MY ID BACK me and almost hit me in the face!  I have never been treated this way, especially by a manager. Cassandra was so rude and unprofessional. I am appalled at her behavior and really am questioning how she has not been fired yet."}
{"text":"RnR has been stepping up its game.   Good food, and no technology traction fee.  A recommended go to place."}
{"text":"Who in their right mind puts ice in a mimosa.  They have these bottomless mimosas I was looking forward to after a long night the previous night...  Mimosas and a good breakfast, sounds great right?  No, it was a farce...  This place puts ice in their mimosas, seriously who does that....  It may or may not have ruined my day.  Food was pretty good thought, but ice in the mimosas....  Really!!!"}
{"text":"RnR is awesome! One of the coolest places I have been to in old town! Weekend mornings are poppin with a live DJ that plays up to date music along with BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS that do the trick. Service was a 10/10 with a friendly and  great looking staff.  I would recommend RnR to anyone who is looking to have a great time and good food! Ill defiantly be back!!!!"}
{"text":"If you offer bottomless mimosas + bloody marys, you better believe I'm there. They offer it on Saturdays & Sundays from 10am-3pm, you can switch between mimosas and bloodys (because no one wants more than 1 bloody), and they were not stingy with the refills! It was only $20 if you bought an entree, and I'd definitely say I got my money's worth. We sat outside on a hot day, but they had misters and fans which kept it comfortable. They also hack an amazing live DJ playing fun music the entire time. Lastly, I fell in love with my meal. I ordered the Applewood Smoked Bacon Brussel Sprouts Burger with raspberry demi glace, jarisberg cheese, onion jam, and it came on a pretzel bun. 1 word: heaven. I would eat this burger over and over again. I also got the sweet potato tots - totally worth the up charge. They need to bring this brunch place to Wisconsin!"}
{"text":"I am way torn about this place so I'll split it up into pros and cons.   Pros:  Nice server Good happy hour! Food was fast  Cons:  Our server was nice but wayy wayyyyy slow.  Very loud. I'm young and I appreciate a fun noisy restaurant but this was way louder than it should be... The food was just okay...we had animal fries for an appetizer which were good, I had tacos which were NOT worth full price (I got them for $5 because of happy hour but would have never paid full price, they were tiny and weird lol) and my boyfriend had a sonoran hot dog which he said was just okay.   In short, it wasn't my favorite restaurant in the world and I probably wouldn't go back BUT if you're out looking for a good happy hour and a fun atmosphere with friends check it out!"}
{"text":"Love this spot- especially for weekend breakfasts. Not to sound like a pervert or anything, but the staff is quite good looking, and very nice as well. I've been here several times, and always received excellent service.   Good people-watching spot, but the food is also very good.  Everything I've tried here has been scrumptious and fairly priced. Try the protein pancakes. Also, as others have stated, come here to take advantage of the bottomless mimosas."}
{"text":"It always nice to be one of the firsts to see a new restaurant, nightclub, bar, etc.  Especially because the service is typically great, everything is shiny & new.  And the enthusiasm of many familiar faces is felt from the moment you walk in.   RnR Scottsdale's opening night was no different than previously stated.    There was a much smaller food menu available, but they are Ready-N-Rolling (Rock-n-Roll, Rest-N-Relaxation, pick one or make up your own definition).  I had the new IPA by New Belgium (Fat Tire), Ranger.  Clean, smooth, not too hoppy.  The setting is comfortable and warm (heating on both upper and lower patios), TV's galore, great location on Scottsdale Road near RA and the Billet Bar.  There are a number of great names associated with this new endeavor and it shows.  They created a great vibe that will undoubtedly be the next contender for \"The Place\" to be.  Beginning this Saturday morning, they will roll out breakfast for the first time.  The menu, hours of operation and location make this a home-run in my book.  (had to throw that in for all the spring training fans that will be in the area.)"}
{"text":"I hesitate to be critical of a place when it's only just opened. But I do this because I hope some of the problems can be fixed.  I'll start with the positive. The vibe of the place was great. I'm a huge fan of the building. The aesthetics of it are awesome. It feels small and intimate, but looking around, it can obviously accommodate a lot of people. From what I've seen, it's more geared towards large groups of people, with many large booths with room for 8.  There are a few problems that I'm sure every restaurant has when just starting out. The food took a very long while to come out. Which doesn't make sense, because not many people were ordering food. The most disappointing part was that the menu was limited to about 4 items. I went there on the third day they were open though, so all of this is completely forgivable.  There are a few things that I would expect to be more difficult to fix. Parking was a huge PITA. We parked about a half mile away, but I guess that's to be expected in Old Town. The location is right across from a biker bar. With a bunch of people coming and going from there with open pipes, it was difficult to have a conversation indoors next to a closed window. I imagine it was much worse for everyone on the patio. Above all, I don't think the quality of the food justified the price. I had the blue cheese burger, for $13. It was cooked to order nicely (med-rare), but had little flavor other then the toppings. The meat itself wasn't spectacular, which is what I would expect at that price. And the parmesan fries that came with were bland and came in a small portion.  There's a good amount of buzz about this place, and I think it shows promise. I definitely want to come back once they've settled in and give things another try."}
{"text":"Good music, young hip crowd, Good selection of beer and cocktails. If you want to be seen or see this is the place to be. Where else do you have a DJ playing a mix of music while the games are on. Food is rich and the help is very friendly"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for your bottomless mimosas/bacon bloody marys. The employees have a great attitude for our party of 15 and always kept our mimosas topped. We had a wide variety of their breakfast menu and enjoyed the wide variety of foods offered. My top food picks would be the biscuits and gravy, bacon brussels sprouts, and breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and a cool vibe. The burgers are amazing and their happy hour and reverse happy hour has some solid deals."}
{"text":"Food was marginal....Sunday brunch.  Prices were stupid.  And I felt like I  was in a New Orleans' night club...on Sunday morning.  Ick"}
{"text":"Service was super disappointing. Our waitress simply lacked any hustle. We were greeted for the first time 5-10 mins after we were seated. She served a warm bottle of white wine, and simply missed submitting several food/drink orders. She seemed busy hanging out with her friends.  There are several other competing establishments in the area that I'd recommend over this place."}
{"text":"Went here for a late brunch but not take advantage of the Mimosas.  Good atmosphere, pretty girls everywhere, and people were drinking.  Perfect for a hangout, drinking brunch place. We got there just after 2, so we missed the brunch menu though.  There were some egg tacos on the menu that i was able to order however.  They were pretty average.  But the side of brussel sproats with bacon was amazing.  Would come back if I am in town."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place! Lots of outdoor seating. Went at 11 on a weekday so not to busy but I've heard the wait can be up to an hour on weekends. Very good for boozing and brunch. Young people place for sure."}
{"text":"Sevice was great. The food unfortunately is meh at best. Nothing to write home about for sure. We did a late, late Sunday night. So maybe it was just the re-heat mac & the over cooked re-heat bacon? The patio & bar seating is nice however & the drinks are good. I'd come back for that alone & skip the food."}
{"text":"Sunday funday with bottomless mimosas (ends at 3pm) minus the cheap pre-mixed oj/champagne (headache anyone?) is awesome and in a great, CROWDED atmosphere IF you don't mind the young bro crowd with good but LOUD music (DJ 11-3). Food is excellent. You are not able to call in a reservation but can make a reservation once at the restaurant. To avoid a 3 hour wait (literally), arrive BEFORE 10:30. Special shout out to Sam who was an EXCELLENT waitress! Ask for her if you can! She deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Acceptable. I'd probably give 1 star if they weren't the main Giants hangout in Old Town.   We have been for dinner and brunch. Neither time was the service bad, but it wasn't very good either. Inattentive is probably the right word.   The food is nothing special. I had an average burger at dinner and today brunch was an overcooked omelet and mimosas. The drinks were good but we had to ask a random server for utensils after our food was served. It took a long time so the food was cold by the time we started eating.   Also, you ran out of ice at 10:00 AM? What...? Why...?  I would never choose RnR. There are so many gems in Old Town and this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed in the service. I love the food here, as do my friends. We always go for the chicken lollipops. This time we went in mid afternoon after the morning rush and the waiter was horrible. The waiter took our drink order and didn't even give it to the bar tender. We watched him flirt with a waitress fifteen feet from our table for the next twenty minutes. We actually had to go to the bar to get our own drinks. The bar tender recognized what happened and offered us free drinks, but by that time we just wanted to get the check and get out of the place.   It's a shame because we really do like the food here l, guess business must be so good that they don't care about service yet."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour. Nice server. Food was a bit slow coming out. Tried the chicken lolipops, sliders and animal fries. Everything was very average & typical for bar food. Probably wouldn't be my top happy hour recommendation for food, but it's a nice place to sit outside with big TVs."}
{"text":"Garbage! I wish I had never gone in here. Their food tastes like it cost pennies to make but they charge you plenty $$. Their staff is absolutely useless but maybe that is because they are all students.   Be prepared to wait a long time for your drinks, appetizer and entree. Be prepared to have people walk by you without asking if you need anything, or you can stay away  and save your money. You will be disappointed...guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer, this is a review from January. I just noticed it didn't get posted.  I have been here many times and never been disappointed. The food is typically better then average, service average, and prices decent. Tonight was a new experience.   We were sat outside on the patio in the couch seating right after the start of Thursday night football.  Shortly after, we were asked for drinks and appetizers. Then again, in a very acceptable amount of time, our server brought our drinks and a runner brought our appetizer. So far so good.   All went downhill after this. It soon became apparent that our waiter had to many tables, so he made a decision to ignore the patio. A runner brought our food out, and the server took our appetizer plate away, but left without asking if we would like our empty beers filled, let alone ever once offer a water. I decided to start eating to keep my food from getting cold, but after 15-20 more minutes without seeing him, I went to the bar to order. The bartender went and got my server. Instead of seeing us, he went to the table next to us to get their drinks. I had to get up again and follow him to the bar to order from him.   Our drinks came later with no apology and our plates were cleared. I sat another 15 minutes waiting to ask for the check, but the server never came. I went and found the server, followed him to the register, and paid him on the spot.   I have not been back since."}
{"text":"Great for happy hour!  Sweet potato tots and Ahi tacos are a must (only $5 during happy hour)!  The patio was great, the service was okay but it was happy hour so that's somewhat expected."}
{"text":"Can i just say that this place would have gotten 5 stars but the staff was lacking...our waiter was amazing and he suggested.a loaded.blue moon...it was delicious...its a half shot.of absolut mandarin and half a shot of peach schnapps...with an orange slice of.course...it was amazing that might be my new drink...he was nice but he was the only one...the hostesses.were not.friendly and the bartender was cold too...but the food was awesome omg!!! We got the animal.fries.holy crap talk about heaven...its pulled pork on sweet potato and regular fries with melted.white.cheddar and bbq sauce and ranch on the side...can you say delicious?? Then we had spinach dip which was great too...the atmosphere is cool...i like how open it.is...i will frequent this place but i hope the staff is more like our.original waitor...he was awesome...it was delicious...i want.to try their sliders and veggie tacos they looked.amazing..."}
{"text":"I will never, ever again!!   I hosted my Meetup groups monthly brunch here, it was a party of 20! I made reservations a month prior, confirmed actually 9 days before Sunday brunch.   Backstory: when I originally called to make brunch reservations (a month prior) the hostess said let me get you a manager. I don't think we'll take reservations for a party that large on a Sunday. Me: no problem! *waiting on hold* manager comes to the phone and makes the reservation for me. So 20 people Sunday, July so and so!   Fast forward to 9 days before my actual reservation. I called to confirm the number in my party, the time and date. The hostess read everything back to me correctly!!   Fast forward again to the Sunday of!! I get there, along with 4 of my party of 20. The hostess is sorting through the book ... No reservation! They get a manger ... No reservation!! Within 20 mins they put together a table (section) for 20. Ironically we're located directly next to a party of 21 women  I went on and asked the ladies if they had a reservation. They said NO!! Their table had 21 people sitting there. Clearly .... This was my section!!! I'm convinced!!   So the manager out together our section which consisted of a table of 10 and 5 small tables for 2. We literally had to constantly tell people \"this is our section ... Yes the whole section\" the entire time we dined!!   I host a brunch or happy hour for my meetup group, anywhere between 8-25 people monthly. This was by far the worse experience!"}
{"text":"Saturday and Sunday bottomless bloody Mary's and Mimosas! And they are very good with refills your glass never gets empty. Get there early because weekend mornings can get a little busy, live DJ all day so it also get a little loud. Love the patio but it's getting a little warm today proved it! I had the breakfast sandwich pretty standard sausage egg and cheese on your choice of breads including a waffle I kept it safe (an English muffin) It was very average. An hour later we ordered the \"dirty chips\" for the table, homemade potato chips, bleu cheese bacon ranch and buffalo sauce. It had a lot of taste flavors going on and it was good.  Then \"animal fries\" sweet potato and Parmesan fries topped generously with pulled pork/white cheddar and BBQ sauce. The portion was huge but I don't like BBQ or pulled pork so I gave up trying to eat around it.  Everyone else at the table liked it."}
{"text":"4 of us went for dinner. 3 out 4 ordered a drink they were out of. They didn't tell me about mine for awhile. So getting drinks took 30 minutes or so. Waitress said no gluten-free menu then I opened menu had gf options....hmmm. we got apps and went somewhere else to eat. Disappointed heard so many good things"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour-not so happy! The food was mediocre at best and 1/2 off house wine was $6 for a glass  So many other choices in the area"}
{"text":"This place is pretty on point! Good music, good food and good people! It was a long wait on a Sunday but well worth it... Tomi was the best! She never let our drinks get below halfway. Anticipated our every need and knows the true meaning of customer service. Definitely a must try when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent!! The staff was very friendly and the food was great. The staff looked well organized and efficient and management seemed to be helping  everyone out. Great team work and an awesome environment.  Definitely try there award wining bacon brussels burger. Great spring training spot awesome drinks and a great happy hour! will definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"Hello Uzra- you are welcome and yes I will be back :-).   Feb 1 2018  We were hosting a singles happy hour event before going on the Scottsdale Art Walk.  The server was attentive and the food was delish. The brussel spouts were off the chain and I highly recommend them.  The place has clean restrooms, close by parking and a menagerie of Lime Bikes nearby for rent."}
{"text":"RnR is the spot to be football Sunday or any other Sunday in that case. Get bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's (can be switched back and forth throughout the sitting) and a party is sure to await. Plenty of TVs around to watch your favorite team. Can be very busy during bottomless hours so don't expect a table unless you're prepared to wait. Had their food on several different occasions it is decent but nothing to write home about, more of a social setting and a place to go have fun!"}
{"text":"They play awful music 90% of the time but serve food until 11 pm and it really is great food:)... Just fix the horrible music!! Way too loud and usually crappy top 40 or cheesy dj's...sigh!"}
{"text":"Alright cocktail, overpriced.   Nachos were anything but homemade.  Good place to go if you're hammered and want hangover food.  Beware if sober."}
{"text":"I rarely go to a new place without \"yelping\" it but Bandera was closed for lunch.  So we rolled the dice to find a really great lunch. Service was excellent, atmosphere was casual and relaxed.  Half price wine on Tuesday.  Food was great.  We split Ahi Tuna tacos then a blue cheese burger.  LOVE jicama tortillas and the sweet potato tots with a hint of salty cheese on them... worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Looked like a cool place, but after my sister and I waited 30 minutes to get seated (bartenders made good drinks while waiting) the waitress completely ignored us. She acted like we were invisible. Maybe it had something to do with the demographics of the bar, but hey who knows... we left after being ignored for 20minutes after we were seated."}
{"text":"I met a friend at RnR for a drink on a Saturday night. First off, the place is absolutely awesome inside and out. We ventured to the upstairs patio and saw nowhere to sit. So we went back towards downstairs, until we were hunted down by one of the servers for the upstairs portion, who broke up a table and made somewhere for us to sit. That was pretty good service!  I had their version of a chambord margarita and a beer. The rita was pretty good, not like the ones at Ztejas, a little more tart. It was tasty. Since I did not eat, I cannot comment on the food, but I would totally come back for breakfast looking at the menu.   The atmosphere was nice, the waitstaff friendly.... but my friend and I found one thing very funny. All of the male staff wear these like low v-neck shirts. We found it kind of funny. We were wondering if waxing your chest was part of the job description. Just something we noticed.  When I actually eat there I will update my review."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch, really good bloodys and mimosas. Ordered the build your own burrito, it was blah, bland, no real flavor. My husband ordered the protein pancakes, same thing, bland. Good service but the food we had was so mediocre we don't want to try anything else."}
{"text":"Me in my wife went to RNR on the weekend, but was denied entry due to her having a tattoo on her face. They said that its not allowed on the weekends, but during the weekday. its an egyptian symbol an \"unk\" and its really small, but they said its not up to them to determine if its gang affiliated or not. At the same time i seen people that were dressed extremely inappropriate. i asked to speak with the manager and was told he doesn't want to be bothered with policy questions. i was completely offended and disgusted with this place. i called the manager here and was told that they have the right to refuse service to me for anything. If i could give this place a negative i would."}
{"text":"Service was extremely prompt and professional.  Dirty chips were simple and delicious.  Stuck with appetizers for a main course and went with the Blue Cheese Sliders, which were super."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!  I actually give it no stars if I could.  I'll say one star because the beer was cold.  Went in this Sunday afternoon to meet some friends for a drink.  Sat ourselves at a table near the bar.  There were about 6 waitresses or hostesses, and NOT ONE SINGLE EMPLOYEE stopped to ask if we have been helped.  As we try to stop one of the waitress passing by to ask if we can place an order, she rudely said to please ask OUR hostess for help.  WHOEVER THAT WOULD BE AND LIKE WE WOUKD KNOW WHO SHE WAS.  For customer service, you would at least think she would say she'll get her for us, but NOPE!  However the same waitress who could not help us or inform our hostess that there's a table needing service, did by the way, serve two guys who sat right across from us 30 mins later.  She served them promptly too, as she did with the table behind us!  As we walked out, a hostess finally spoke to us and said, \"Byeeeee, thank you for stopping by.\"  I told her, you know what.....that's the first time a hostess bothered to speak to us."}
{"text":"Oh my Ahi Tacos!!!  They were OH SO Delicious!!  They had the right textures and flavors going on, and at first these tacos seem tiny, but they are such joy and goodness that even that small of a portion is packed of greatness!! It settles so well!! :)  The service was great!! We had two very lovely ladies help us, on what seemed to be a busy Wednesday afternoon/ Happy Hour. Our server was genuinely suggestive and sweet!  The four stars is just due to the surplus of employees that were just wondering around our tables, (mostly guys) that looked over and walked around looking bored kinda distracting when your having a conversation and enjoying food!  Other than that, this place is great!!"}
{"text":"Always outstanding food.  The 40 something's loved the food, drink, and music tonight.  The live music is at an appropriate volume and VERY good."}
{"text":"Went here for my bachelorette party dinner a few weeks, our waitress was amazing and catered to 25 of us by herself. The food was really good, drinks were bomb. Felt really old there though with the crowd that kept coming in - and I'm only 21. Definitely is for the in the now hipster kinda crowd, all the servers are gorgeous and friendly. They have an upstairs portion for bigger parties.   My husband and I went the other night and got the waitress that had served me prior and she remembered me! We only got apps and beers because their apps are huge! Worth it."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited when I looked around and saw a server with a shirt which read Welcome to the B.A.E. bacon and eggs Area! Then I got even more excited when I saw on the board, Sat & Sunday Funday with the SF Giants logo! Of course I'm a huge Bay Area fan so automatically this place gets extra brownie points for representin'! :) My home away from home!  We were here for brunch with a few friends. The atmosphere is energetic and lively! I would caution against bringing kids or anyone who hates loud music. It's reminiscent of the party brunches in NYC, but with a sports flair and a more laid-back atmosphere. There are a multitude of TV panels so you can catch whatever sport your heart desires! Service was great, very friendly servers!   We ordered Animal Fries and the Chambord French Toast. The food is rather heavy so you certainly have to have a ravenous appetite or be in the mood for it.  But because of the Bay Area representation, it deserved 5 stars in my book!!"}
{"text":"RnR is a great place to grab a drink and take in a game.   Stopped in here at 10pm on a Saturday and the bar was in full swing. The bartenders are wicked fast, they had to be keeping up with over 100 thirsty patrons and the service was as impeccable as it was speedy. There was also a great mix of people and the male to female ratio was perfect. Something you normally would never see at a bar like this.   I really enjoy the floor plan of this establishment as it opens up to the street providing an airy feeling without losing any energy. The drink prices were very reasonable as well, a trend I noticed throughout Scottsdale. Maybe it is that OC/LA is that damn expensive? Your call.  I also noticed they offer a full menu and will have to return on my next visit to AZ to sample their offerings. As a bar alone you get no complaints from this Yelper.   RnR brings the ruckus!"}
{"text":"great mac and cheese the place really gets busy i was there sat morning and it was slammed live dj and it was like Friday night never ended"}
{"text":"The fries and wings were really good! Plus free shots? Waitress was friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"Second night in row (on a week night both nights) that there was a private party preventing us from trying out this spot. Extremely disappointed. Didn't expect this place to be so inaccessible. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Tomorow  is the best waitress I've ever had here and I come often for brunch.  She was super attentive and accommodating when people were being difficult.  I love her energy and great personality.  I will always sit in her section if she's working :).  Best waitress ever !!!!;"}
{"text":"Needed to kill some time before catching our flight home and decided to check out Old Town Scottsdale. After walking around the tourist trap shops we decided to stop at RnR for lunch. It was pretty busy for a Thursday afternoon, but then again it was St. Pats day, and spring training was nearby.  Inside and outside the restaurant there were plenty of TVs going with the latest March Madness games. It did take a little longer than expected to be helped once we were seated, but after that everything else was fine, the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  I had the seared ahi tacos. The portions were a little small (although I guess it was under the small platter section), but they were still very tasty.  If yelp offered it, I would give RnR 3.5 stars. It's not somewhere I would go out of my way to visit, but I would suggest it to a friend, and if the opportunity presented itself, I would go again."}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 6 other times because I tried to give your restaurant the benefit of the doubt, and I will not return. Despite one experience with good service, there have been six other times when I have had  incredibly awful service. That's not a good ratio and at this point, I just can't justify coming back nor would I recommend RnR at all.  My most recent experience sealed the one star review. First, there was no one to greet us at the door and seat us. We sat ourselves. Then, we sat at a table for about 10 minutes. No waiter to be seen. No one even came around to serve the other tables around us with patrons. Ah ha! Next, we spot a waiter. After inquiring with this individual as to where our waiter was/if they were closing or something (trying to give them benefit of the doubt) the waiter looked at us begrudgingly, gave us a half eye roll and said, \"I guess I can serve you.\"  Well, after that remark I just wanted to get up and walk out. But I stayed (a decision that I now regret) only to experience more poor service.   We needed more drinks, our waiter was nowhere to be found. Then we noticed all the waiters hanging out near the order input computers. The restaurant wasn't crowded, and I know my order wasn't being taken or put into the computer... instead it looked like social hour. Unprofessional.   This is not the first time that I have experienced inattentive and no-where-to-be-seen service at RnR, and I guess I should have known better. I don't even think my request to be seated so that I could have a waiter take my order was THAT outlandish.  I work very hard for my money to be able to enjoy some \"RnR\" on the weekends. So, with lots of other places (like AZ88, Old Town Tavern, Mabel's on Main, Firehouse, Pattie's, The Lodge, Geshia-A-Go-Go, and the list could go on) where I can count on being served... by an actual live body nonetheless... who doesn't even make me feel like they hate me just because I walked through the door... there's no reason to come here.  It was especially awful to be treated so poorly when I'm a Giants fan, and my team's flag is hanging out front of the establishment!! I'm going to pass on anymore of this place's \"RnR,\" as I'm pretty sure it actually stands for \"Really Rude\" service."}
{"text":"Warning: This review is solely based on Sunday Brunch... So from my experiences in Scottsdale so far, RnR is the prime spot for 'Sunday Funday'. They offer $15 endless mimosas and bloody Mary's with a food purchase. It's getting hard writing this review because I love food so much and the food here was absolutely delicious. I got the pulled pork hash with scrambled eggs and I couldn't even eat all of it because they give you so much food and my mimosa never sat empty in it's glass for more than a minute. The servers are very quick and efficient and make sure you always have what you need. All my friends also loved their food and service and have made RnR part of their Sunday ritual. There are plenty of TVs to watch sports throughout the entire establishment.   My recommendations for RnR are to go earlier in the day because the later you go the longer you are going to wait, because it really is a very popular spot in Scottsdale (the wait can get up to an hour or longer). Definitely get the endless Bloody Mary/mimosa deal and if you are waiting for a table you can order the deal at the bar, pay $25 and then they take $10 off your total food bill. Their breakfast entrees are very delicious and they give you a lot of food, so if you get the endless bm/mimosa deal you can expect to spend $25-35, which isn't bad for a Sunday brunch.   Overall loved my experience at RnR!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love RnR!! The burgers are off the chart good and the wings... to die for: they literally melt in your mouth, specially the BBQ ones. As George Takai would say, oohhhh myyyy! My husband loves the beer and wine menu but I love the virgin bloody Mary's!  It's always a crowd but the wait is worth it. Help is always hustling and the management rocks! We don't mind he wait because hey, it's Arizona not New York people and the atmosphere is way fun and like I said - the food never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"I never have the time of my life here, but it is consistently average and sometimes that's just fine. I continue to come back, so they're doing something right! Great alcohol selections for happy hour, but food choices on the discounted menu are on the greasy side and leave something to be desired. Think of this place more as a cool bar that has food, than a restaurant with a cool bar. Definitely a safe choice if you're looking to grab a bite before a night out. Veggie burger, chicken lollipops, and sweet potato tots are recommended."}
{"text":"I really love going here for Sunday Funday. They have endless mimosas and make your own burritos that are to die for. Plus the lollipop chicken is amazing."}
{"text":"By far one of the best menu's in Old Town Scottsdale. Bar food with a gourmet twist. The mac n cheese was to die for, I even added chicken and bacon to it! SO DELICIOUS. The place to be on Sunday mornings! Live music, drinks for days, and beautiful people all around. Attentive staff and great service! Overall would rate this place a 10/10! If you haven't stopped by RnR, DO IT. I'll be there every Sunday from now on!"}
{"text":"UPDATE as of 1/1/14: This place has gone from 4 stars to 5, and it deserves it.  The service is fantastic, especially the last time I went for bottomless mimosas. Big shoutout to Mike.  Great server.  The patio is amazing for people watching.  Couches, tables, and room to stand/drink.  The food is delicious. Try the Animal Fries and the Pulled Pork Hash.    The drinks are ridiculously good.  I can't get over how good of a deal the bottomless mimosas are.  The DJ is awesome and it feels like every time you take a sip of mimosa, it's full again.  That's the recipe for a perfect Sunday Funday.  Bring your party pants, and get there early.  See ya next time!"}
{"text":"I went to RnR last week for brunch because one of my husband's good friends was in town visiting. It's one of the only places (that I know of) that you can get brunch and drinks during the week, which was exactly what we were looking for. I had the sundried scramble, it wasn't amazing but definitely good. I really liked the portion size, not minimal but not huge and overwhelming as it seems most places are these days. Next time I will definitely try something else as a lot of other menu items sounded really good to me. Our server was super nice and the place wasn't that crowded at all (so no negatives regarding the clientele from me). Husband loved his bloody mary made with the unique pepper infused vodka. I also really loved my cappuccino, so much that I had two. WAY better than Starbucks - and the coffee cups are so darling (I really wanted to steal one)!  We will definitely be going back for breakfast/brunch and to try out Happy Hour as well, the drink/food specials looked awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was good... i was out there from california had to clue were to go or were to eat so i just picked to go here with the family! it was very good.... our waiter was very nice..... they also have an discount if you work in the restaurant..... So i would deff go back if i go back to Scottdale!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place 1 star, horrible service. We were in a 15 minute wait where they failed to contact us, so we show up 30 minutes after to the restaurants full top deck empty but most all tables had trash on them( where it remained the whole time we were there) They seat us and we wait another 20 minutes to get a drink. By the time we get our drink we just want our check, the server brought our check within .3 seconds great atmosphere but shitty service. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Another great new location from the Corieri's, creators of Axis/Radius, Suede Lounge, Myst, Sandbar and, for those who remember, Jetz and Stixx.  RnR is located in a brand new building on the South edge of Oldtown Scottsdale and right across the street from the former Billet Bar (I don't know its new name). The atmosphere is your typical Scottsdale eatery/sports bar. Big flatscreen TV's, large bar and lots of attractive people in designer jeans. There's both indoor and outdoor seating and its definitely a place to start the night before heading out for the Scottsdale club scene.  The service was quick and very good. I had the sirloin steak sandwich with sweet potato fries while others in my party tried various burgers and salads. My sandwich was excellent and others enjoyed their food as well. The fries are served in a small bucket and reminded me of the ones at Delux Burger.  The only reason RnR loses a star is that once the football game ended, the music was turned up so loud that it was practically impossible to hear the people at my own table.   I can see turning up the music later in the evening, but we were there on Sunday night and the NFL playoff game ended at about 6:00 which still strikes me as the dinner hour and it was disconcerting to have the music get so loud so early."}
{"text":"The building is in a good  location so wanted to try it. $18 glass of champagne came in a plastic tumbler. Absolutely not....They ran out of bottle beer and the waitress brought a draft beer without asking if we wanted it. Which we didn't and still tried to charge us. To top it off a portion of each food plate was cold. Skip this place altogether."}
{"text":"We stopped by here after a spring training game last Sunday for drinks and dinner. I loved the setup of the patio and inside bar, especially because there were plenty of tv's to catch Selection Sunday. The prices seemed a little high but it is in Scottsdale. I ordered the RnR burger. The bacon was thick and flavorful but the hamburger tasted and looked like it had been frozen.  As I was eating I thought the burger and fries at Zipps was better and less expensive. Although the drinks seemed expensive, they did include a double shot. Our waitress was friendly but seemed pre-occupied and had a hard time keeping our order straight. She ended up bringing us an extra iced tea and mixed drink the bar made, but seemed to disappear when we needed her. Even if the service were great I don't know if I'd make it a point to go back based on the food and price of the drinks."}
{"text":"Do not go here at night! The parade themselves on being one of the only restaurants open late in old town, but yet they should change their hours. Every time we go in there before 11pm they somehow are closing. Just now no one was there to greet us, which is understandable seeing as it is late but as we walk to seat ourselves they tell from the bar we did last call. Consistency is what will make a break a restaurant, if your hours say that you are open until 12 then stay open until 12!"}
{"text":"Kian was an awesome server! Had a fantastic experience. Great food and fun atmosphere. Definitely would recommend to anyone I meet who hasn't been. If you decide on a Sunday brunch definitely request Kian as your server! :)"}
{"text":"The breakfast is my favorite--pancakes, waffles, and the amish french toast are a sweet tooth's yummiest options. Not only does their food look great, but their staff as well! DJs are awesome, and the atmosphere is young and fun."}
{"text":"Came in today at 10:50am. The girl at the front said it would be 30-50 minute wait for our party of 3. We agreed to wait. She took our phone number and we waited.  At 11:45 we checked back in, she said it would be about another 30 minutes. It is now 12:53 and still haven't received a call.   Dear RNR, get it together. There's plenty of open tables."}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Staff friendly. Establishment was clean. Went here for a birthday party which was on the top floor outside. I really liked the area where the party was being held. The food was good! Pretzels and queso = amazing - couldn't get enough. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"In fairness I've only been to RNR Gastropub a few times (and I'm not from the area).  But its a cool outdoor/open air bar with a lot of tvs. Great place to watch games and catch a drink.  Food is pretty good for bar food and prices are reasonable.  Only thing holding it back from a higher rating is the service can be so so (occasionally borderline unfriendly).  You might wait awhile for service.  And I'm not sure why they need a hostess at all (when her only job seems to be glowering at people).  Cmon people. Be happy, you live in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I believe Old Town Scottsdale is already well-known for its wide selection of restaurants, so I imagine it's pretty tough to start a new one these days and set yourself apart.  In spite of that, RnR is doing a pretty good job of it so far.  My wife and I and six other friends had dinner and drinks here last night (a Saturday night).  Despite the place being full (not packed, but full), I thought we received friendly, attentive service throughout the night.  With that alone, you've basically won me over.  But, as I said, we have lots of choices in Old Town, so the food needs to be pretty good, too.  And it was!  My wife and I shared the ahi tacos to start.  They weren't your traditional ahi tacos - they were served on jicama tortillas - but that's okay.  The proportion was rather small, but they were delicious.  Moving on, I had the prime rib sandwich and my wife had the portobello mushroom sandwich.  Everything, including what I heard from our friends at the table, was excellent.  Actually, my sweet potato fries were soggy (not firm or crispy), but I'm going to write that off, because the flavor was still very good.  I'm sure if I had said anything to our waiter about it, he would've gladly done something.  I just didn't feel the need to.  There are also TVs everywhere, and music playing overhead.  I liked that combination, because I could keep up with the game on TV, but my wife didn't have to hear the announcer the entire time either.  Nice one, RnR."}
{"text":"We were in from out of town and chose to eat brunch here on a Saturday. Loved the food, drinks, and atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a great late breakfast at RnR this weekend after checking out the local farmers market in downtown Scottsdale.  Trying to eat healthier so went for the make your own omelette.  I selected chorizo, spinach, mushroom and sausage for my ingredients and all blended nicely.  I gave my kids the potatoes and they really liked them.  My wife had the breakfast tacos and thought they were very good.  Saw a few people enjoying the bloody marys going around so next visit will try one of those.  If you are in the mood for lunch make sure to go closer to 11am as they don't serve lunch till 11am."}
{"text":"RnR is the spot for Sunday funday, mimosas, bloody marries, and great food. Ask for Cassidy the service is great, also she's a beauty, refills drinks pretty quick and stays up on the water cups."}
{"text":"I've always liked this place, but recently came here for happy hour during spring training. Since it's so crowded they don't do it during spring training but the manager and my server were very nice and honored it anyways. That's excellent service and will always keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"It's a bar. They have drinks. A little obnoxious that at 4pm on a Wednesday they pushed my wife and I into a two top in the corner of the patio near the un ready outdoor bar. The sun was hot. When we asked to move to one of the 6 empty tables in a better location we were told those were reserved for larger groups. I can find better bars with drinks to spend my money."}
{"text":"Went here after an Ignite Phoenix event and had a fantastic time with friends on the balcony upstairs.  Ate some ridiculously tasty Animal Fries and had several drinks. Everyone in our party got their food very fast, and it was all quite good.  Not sure I'd care for the indoor restaurant area ambiance, but the patio and balcony were great and I'd definitely return!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had the French toast, you messed up. I've been here a few times now. All for the same reason... Amish French Toast. I don't drink so I couldn't tell you anything about that."}
{"text":"RnR has a great brunch during the weekends. I came here with a big group and we were all impressed by the party atmosphere, paired with efficient service. There's a great deal on bottomless mimosas, and our server, Cassie (who was phenomenal) kept our glasses filled. They give you a wristband for the mimosas, so you can float around the restaurant, and can get a new drink wherever you are. The dj was great, and I appreciated that he took requests and played them quickly. I would definitely come back here for brunch when I'm up in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but service was way too slow. Waitress was Shanna, who was a bit difficult to get ahold of.  Don't bother with the sundae dessert, as it's just 3 scoops of ice cream with chocolate sauce on it... Or at least that's what we got. We asked for the nuts which they forgot, ended up showing up as we were finished eating it. Cool looking restaurant though!  Grilled buffalo chicken sandwich pretty dry too but waitress was nowhere around to tell. Oh well, live and learn"}
{"text":"Sunday's are not for people that hate a crowd. The bottomless mimosa's are awesome. The staff is attentive and friendly. The salmon and Ahi Salads are so tasty."}
{"text":"Great place for a variety of reasons. I like hitting RnR for a night starter or for brunch on the weekend. Follow them on facebook and they give you passwords for happy hour after the typical HH times.   Great ambiance and vibe."}
{"text":"The service here was good, but the salad was served in a tiny container, making it difficult to eat without spilling salad everywhere, and the grilled cheese was pretty flavorless, the Gouda should have been paired with a sweeter bread, and the bacon came on it in 2 chunks, so only 2 bites have bacon, it should be chopped up and sprinkled on as the cheese is melting. The drinks are decent though."}
{"text":"Despite having 20 girls and 17 credit cards, this place killed it for brunch on Sunday!! The service was amazing!   Our waitress Shelby not only handled our two tables - but a few other groups-  like a boss!!! She was quick, attentive and so sweet.   For the food:   the hungover fries- A MUST!!! and live true to the name.   the XL cinnamon roll- enough to share with a whole table and delicious !  the buffalo chicken burger- insane....  As if the food couldnt get better, the bottomless bloodymary's and mimosas were always full and fit perfectly with the DJ.   Will be back. 10000% recommended for big groups."}
{"text":"I have been to RnR a few times since it has opened.  I have read people have had slow service.  I feel that it has improved 110%.  We had an awesome server the last time I was in on Friday night.  The chicken lollipops are to die for!  The Stigmata (sp?) Vodka drink with berries is also fantastic.   They brought in a DJ that night after happy hour.  My friends and I sang and danced in our seats all night.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"RnR is a great gastro pub in Scottsdale but I like to call it an \"upscale\" gastro sports bar.  It is another great example of a new wave of cool, creative restaurants in Old Town from it's extremely high ceilings with big folded garage style windowed doors, to it's large covered patio with it's own connected bar.  The food is excellent and it's the PERFECT place to watch your favorite sporting event."}
{"text":"Quick Update - On Tuesday, the Burgers are 2-1. WooHoo. That is like a $14 savings. Same great burgers were consumed yesterday and the sweet potato tots were an excellent side dish choice as well. Burger Tuesday will be replacing Taco Tuesday on some nights going forward.  Mostly burgers on the menu, but these burgers were quite good. In terms of fries, the sweet potato get the edge over the parmesan version. My burger was big, perfectly cooked well and had blue cheese, mushrooms and onions involved. It's fair priced at about 13 bucks. All staff was very friendly too. Kitchen closes at 9pm on Sunday, but had no issues as we rolled in about 8:15pm. Equal or better to Rehab next door."}
{"text":"Been here about 4 times now. Great atmosphere here!  Great food and killer set up! Friendly staff and great music.  Reason for a loss of star??? Last time I went here, one of the waiters or male employees was walking around with pink eye! C'MON MAN! Send the dude home!"}
{"text":"We came with a large party, great atmosphere for what we where looking for. We could be loud with out it being disruptive to others. There wings are amazing! Maybe the best wings I have ever had and for that they get 5 stars. I had some margaritas which were fine. Overall great experience, friendly staff"}
{"text":"I was excited to come back to RnR since I haven't been in a few months. I was very disappointed by the food, the service seemed meh, and the DJ's music selection was all over the place (could be a good thing) but he chose all of the bad songs from their respective genre. I had the vanilla bean pancakes and they were dry and tasted a little like the bread you get at church. My friends had the green chili pulled pork tacos and pulled pork platter which they found to be very bland.   There are many places you can go for brunch, this has sadly fallen to the bottom of my list."}
{"text":"Seemingly unfriendly to POC which is unfortunate. Waited over 20 minutes after being seated by the host. Server that never came however tables around us were happily taken care of."}
{"text":"RnR had the worst service of anywhere I've been in Scottsdale. The hostess was snappy and rude when my friend asked about outside seating. Then our waitress got our drink orders wrong and insisted she hadn't. We finished our drinks but she never came back to take our next order or give us our bill. The worst."}
{"text":"It was hard to believe this place was only open for about 3 weeks when we went in for lunch. They are running pretty smoothly.  Love the stemware and flatware.  For lunch I had the pulled pork, which was great. My dad had the grilled cheese and my mom had the chicken sandwich. All pretty good and came with a HUGE thing of fries. I had the sweet potato fries and they were delicious.  The patio was beautiful and had a nice arrangement of seating for different moods. As the menu expands, it'd be good to include some more southwestern style meals. The appetizers seem fun (pigs in a blanket!) and it looks like a nice place to enjoy drinks in the comfy chairs."}
{"text":"i think my server was on something(and didn't share with us). the animal fries were pretty decent and we really enjoyed the grilled cheese. overall i would recommend the restaurant, and the ambiance is really precious."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer at RnR on Sundays. However, this visit was different than all of my others. There were rowdy patrons behind us on the patio and our server Sam Montes(?) made sure that our needs were always met. He even orchestrated a move to an other table so that my party did not have to be subject to those other customers. I'm grateful that Sam was able to ameliorate our situation and keep my opinion of RnR as positive as possible. Thank you RnR and thank you Sam for such a great experience; I know there are a lot of choices for meals in this area but RnR just never fails me. The Southwest Burger was an awesome recommendation!"}
{"text":"\"Processing Tech Fee!?? Is this a joke? Are restaurants seriously charging customers for their use of  business necessities like tablets or POS systems!!!?? Wow!! I will not come to R&R with this type of business practice. Yup it's not the $1.32 it's the principle and steeling from your customers."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Great food and atmosphere.  Went for brunch and the waitress was always at out table with refills on the bottomless mimosas.   Food was excellent as well.  Plan on making this a regular thing at this place"}
{"text":"Cool downtown spot - good place to catch the game and have some bar food. Was extremely packed for the Super Bowl so my friends and I didn't go but then my sister and I came for a monday afternoon drink and it was pretty low key. Seems like one of those places that can go either way - crazy party scene or super chill bar I guess it depends on the day and event!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were enjoyable. The first time I was here I had the grilled cheese sand which and it was SO good!!! I had the sweet potato fries with it and I left VERY full with leftover's took me 20 minutes to decide what i wanted to eat because everything on the menu looks great! Service was on point! The second time i was here I had the spicy mango margarita and it was pretty good, not the best but pretty good. We had a table of 7 and it was around 9 or 10 at night...for some reason we had like 3 different servers. Weird.  Still one of my new favorite places because the food is great!"}
{"text":"I frequent RnR quite a bit for happy hour.  I've been here tons of times since I moved to AZ.  Definetly one of the best happy hours in old town.  Happy hour from 4-7 LOVE IT (I get mad when places are 3-6- who gets off work that early??).  And pretty every drink is on special during happy hour.  Really cheap wine, beer, and liquor.   Ya their food isn't orgasm AMAZING but it's pretty good.  I've havn't disliked anything I've tried there.   I love the atmosphere and outdoor patio on both levels. I've been for breakfast too and the bottomless mimosas are wonderful.  They keep em coming.  The food is good breakfast food.   I take family/friends from out of town here for happy hours. I love this place I don't get what the hate is about!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times with friends, usually for happy hour, and I have been satisfied each time.  The drinks are good and the food is really good- I recommend the sweet potato tots, awesome.    My last trip was for brunch to try their $15 bottomless mimosas as advertised on their little a-frame.  When we ordered we are informed that in order to get the bottomless drinks, we would have to order breakfast- perf!  We were there for the food too.  So, besides having to order food, there is no catch.  The only problem, you can't get any refills after 2pm.    My recommendation, go early and hungry then enjoy the constant flow of oj and champagne."}
{"text":"First I set downstairs. Struck up a conversation with another single woman. We both set at the bar wanting white wine. The bartender knew nothing about wine or what was stocked. The hostess later provided a cheap looking but creative wine list on strips of paper. They stock a number of reds and whites but none I nor the other woman was familiar with. I prefer Chablis but they don't stock any. So I decided to try the house margarita. Listen closely.... Avoid it! It doesn't taste anything like a margarita, they serve it in their regular cocktail glass and they limit you to two of them. I could not suck it down and I can usually drink just about anything that's a cocktail that I set my mind to with a few exceptions. Mark this as a new exception.   Further more the young bartender did not know what he had on hand. I ordered a Canadian Whiskey and 7 up. He poured and tried to get me to drink a Chivas Regal & 7! The Canadian Club and Seagram Seven was in plain sight!   Our party decided to move upstairs and it took the bar 25 minutes to combine 3 tabs to be paid on one credit card!   Upstairs the waiter decides to card me! Come on I'm old enough to be your mother! He backs down. But when the other female in our party of now four orders a round of shoots for us it takes more than 30 minutes to get them. Because our waiter felt she was tipsy, I'm told when I track him down.   We looked at the menu but nothing was appealing, not even the font choice of the menu! Worst menu I have ever seen in a new establishment. If not the worst ever. Everything is overpriced. Happy hour consist of half off drinks and $1 off small plates! One dollar! Why bother?   The host/hostess furthermore kept people waiting at the door at 5pm when there was a number of tables in sight, as well as the majority of the bar. None of us understood that. The restrooms are located on the main floor only and the women's room is a major track to the entry should you need to go, so beware if you are upstairs! The upstairs is not accessible to anyone who can not climb a flight of steep stairs by the way. Many say they like the building but I personally find nothing about it appreciative. They proudly boast that it was built from the ground up for this purpose & use. Being an ex- architect student, take my opinion for free... it's a crappy design! The excessive outdoor seating is nice for a few months out of the year but soon 3/4 of their seating will be avoided due to the AZ heat or seasonal rainstorms. Also the color scheme of gray on gray isn't very inviting.   I chuck this up to been there, done that. I will not be returning. After all why?  Menu sucks, drinks sucks, service sucks, seating sucks."}
{"text":"Usually I have a really good experience here and thats why they are getting 1 more star today than they deserved for my last visit ok wait I have to take the extra star back the more I think about it so forget it this experience was a 2 star!  Thankfully I had the all you can drink mimosa which helped to make the experience much more tolerable however it was very difficult flagging someone down for a refill so that was not too fun.  I ordered the potato and egg taco.  The waitress said do you want bacon I said sure thinking it would be on the side she brought me 3 plain tacos with eggs and a slice of bacon in it.  It was not good but I ate one cuz I was hungry.  She asked what was wrong and I said its not what I ordered its not the potato egg taco she said oh ok well I charged you for the one you half ass ate.  O.K. whatev"}
{"text":"I would love to have tasted the food but my wife and I sat for 20 minutes without any server asking us what we wanted to drink much less what we wanted to eat.  They seemed more into the music than customer service.  We walked out and no one seemed to notice.  We went around the corner to Rehab burger therapy instead"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place...boy was I disappointed...we order chips and guac to start and they were nowhere to be found..I couldn't find my server so after 10 Minutes I got up to find her. I told her to cancel the chips because the food would be out any minute. Then they come out with the meal and the guac was brown and chips were stale. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it came out burnt bread and flavorless. I'm sorry i don't like to give restaurants a bad rep but it was a really bad experience"}
{"text":"R n R is beautiful, I just love the architectural features.. delicious before you even step inside the door! They have two floors of inside/outside seating, tons of waiters/bartenders and usually great music.Saturday/Sunday afternoons they usually have it loud!! (Which I like).    I like this place because you could bring your mom for lunch or your boyfriend for late night. They have all kinds of appetizers. I would say the flavor is mainly American with a twist. I've had the \"animal fries\" and they are delicious, also the nachos are good and the sliders.. Actually I have to say all the food I have tried has been good. For the portions it does seem like a medium priced place in comparison to other spots that are fancier (Herb Box and Bandera). I have sat inside, and on both floors of the outdoor patios. The decor is very nice, and overall I really like this place and plan to come back."}
{"text":"Chill spot!  Great vibe.  When the weather is nice out the patio is a really relaxing spot to have some drinks.  When it's cold they have heaters on the patio area.  Happy hour is good.  Drinks are stiff and taste great.   Good place to grab some food and drinks before you hit the clubs in the area.  Good service.  the \"Forget About Philly Cheesesteak\" is delicious!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for this place , so me and my boyfriend went here to eat lunch around 3pm on a Saturday.  So we get there and the place is crazy busy , there's no tables available .  We went during the phoenix golf open so I guess that was why it was so busy ? Not sure.  There was dance music blasting , and mostly everybody there was wasted.  People were yelling and dancing , very crowded.  Very loud atmosphere.  So we decided to at least go to the bar and get a few drinks .  It's great if you are looking for a spot to party with your friends , but we went for just a simple lunch.  Not to party.  We never ended up eating anything . We left. I will go back if it's a special occasion and looking to party."}
{"text":"No better place on a Sunday! The bottomless mimosas are one of the best deals in town, and they usually have a great dj. The service can be spotty, but this past weekend our server was on point! My glass was never empty! Oh... the food is good too!"}
{"text":"Went here last Sunday, what a horrible experience. There were four tables of two, two people at the bar, and a table of about eight near the back. We were sat down immediately but didn't see a server for about ten minutes. The hostess actually came up and apologized saying the staff was busy (I counted at least 6 servers working, one person per table would have been possible with the staff vs. patron ratio but I digress) and asked if she could get us waters and pass along the word for drinks. I asked for a beergarita, my girlfriend asked for a cider and fireball drink. The hostess returned and apologized saying they were out of the \"mix\" for the cider and fireball. (What mix? It's cider, and Fireball whiskey. But I can't fault her, she was very nice and overly apologetic, and it's not her job to know the menu. I was actually impressed she took the initiative to help out!) She then ordered a beergarita as well.   About ten minutes later our drinks arrived and waiter said \"I'm sorry, the margaritas are supposed to be frozen but our machine broke so I brought them on the rocks.\" Both of us looked at each other a bit stunned that they didn't tell us that our drink would be changed but didn't complain. We drank the drinks (which were not good at all..basically very limey flat beer), and were ignored for about 10 more minutes AFTER being finished with our beverages. The table behind us went to the bar on two separate occasions to complain that there was no service to speak of anywhere, even though we could see the servers on the other side of the restaurant strolling about. I dropped my card on the table and when the server finally came back I asked to be cashed out and he said \"oh, do you want me to get you another round first?\" we said no, we just wanted to leave.   So he returned fairly quickly with the bill and said \"are you sure you don't want to stay a bit longer, I'm sorry about the wait, maybe I can do something for your next round of drinks.\" A valiant effort to try and dig out of an overall bad experience, but if he had recognized that the service/drinks were so bad, why didn't he mention trying to make it up to us BEFORE running the card? Or discounting the already served drinks?  Anyway, I live within walking distance and I will never have any issues walking by to any of the much better establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Came here in need of some gastro pub food, thought we would give this place a chance even though it looks like a party bar. We were seated rather quickly for a Saturday football game night. The staff are cute young girls (they have to wear little tight black dresses, which is classier than hooters). Started our order with their chicken lollipops, they were fun to eat and had good flavor. The best dish I had was their ahi tacos- YUM and Healthy! Loved their twist on the tortilla and how they used jicama (super creative and clean) all the ingredients they used created a nice flavor. We also had the slider trio- great app to give you a little bit of everything our favorite was the bleu cheese slider.. they used grilled angus beef.  They had an ok wine selection but what we loved was that they properly stored their wines in a wine cooler at the correct temperature. Wished they had a little better selection but it's pretty decent for a sports bar to even have selections to choose from. They had a dj too that was spinning during the football commercials. It was a fun touch."}
{"text":"Had the best lunch here ever! Juicy burger with bacon and cheddar cooked to perfection, fresh mixed green salad with pears, candied walnuts and strawberries was refreshing and delicious. But the homemade kettle potato chips with blue cheese and bacon, drizzled with hot sauce,  ranch dressing and sour cream - oh my! Cocktails were perfectly chilled and made to order, server was attentive and friendly. Great spot for casual meal and for catching a game or two or three!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I went with my Grandma and Aunt on a Thursday afternoon. The weather was great but just a tad windy so we sat inside. First I like the layout of this place, very open and airy. There are 2 outside patios one street level and then one upstairs. I actually have been here twice so far. First time was just for a mid afternoon cocktail with one of my stylists. The servers were very friendly and our concoction of vodka, grapefruit and cranberry juice was the perfect blend.  The second time we ordered 3 small plates to share, ahi tacos, artichoke and spinach dip and the mussels. All three were heavenly and very reasonably priced. The ahi was fresh and chilled, perfect for a warm day. The artichoke dip was different than any I have had before, gooey cheesy goodness that we gobbled up practically licking the bowl. The chips that accompanied the did were fresh and perfectly salted, even when the dip was done we still polished off the chips. The mussels were in a perfect white wine sauce but the stars of this dish were the mussels themselves. Buttery and melt in your mouth good, not chewy at all with no grit, to most common problem I find. The broth was so good I let the bread marinate at the bottom of the bowl, soaking up the juice. My martini was a generous pour and even though they were out of blue cheese stuff olives the bartender took the time to stuff some and deliver it to our table.  Now on to the staff, all are a good looking lot but they are also skilled. All of our food and drinks were delivered in a timely manner by our lovely server Jennifer. We also met one of the sous chefs, Lennie. A charming fellow with stunning blue eyes, my grandmother remarked on them, a playful Mohawk and tattoos peaking out of his uniform. He swears that the sweet potato fries are some of the best in town and sent over a complimentary bucket. I do believe he is right, cooked to perfection, slightly crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside dusted with fresh herbs and I believe Parmesan cheese. After our meal the manager came over to make sure everything was to our liking.  RnR is another great place within walking distance from my salon and I am looking forward to trying everything on their menu. If all the items are as wonderful as the first 3 I tried I am in for a treat!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of restaurants and have to say this was the worst service I've ever had.  Took 20 mins to get any attention and close to an hour to get a BLT.  I have never seen such disorganization.  Won't be back-"}
{"text":"I had never been to RnR and am always pretty skeptical about any place that offers bottomless anything, BUT this was a pleasant surprise! I had such an amazing time!   Part of what made my experience so great, was my server. He started our experience off right by introducing himself (his name was Sam) and offering up some cold drinks!  I wanted to do the bottomless mimosas, but like I said, no place ever gets it right and so many servers can't keep up with the refills. Sam at RnR CAN keep up with my impressive drinking skills! ;) Seriously though, he was so on top of everything and was quick to make great recommendations.  I ended up getting the most amazing pulled pork sandwich; it was to die for!   Sam was also helpful about getting me in the best seat to watch the Patriots game, which he did without disrupting anyone else!  He was amazing and when I come back (I plan on bringing out of town family in the near future) I will most certainly be requesting Sam- and a pulled pork sandwich! ;)"}
{"text":"I've tried... I've really tried to give this place a fair shake.  I've been for dinner, lunch, brunch, bottomless mimosas, to watch a game and never leave happy.  My biggest issue?  They're inconsistent on everything.  I've dealt with everything from rude servers/managers and cold food to waiting over an hour for my food to arrive while everyone else had finished their meal.  It's a cool space in a great area but I wish they would step up their game.  The only reason that I'm giving them two stars instead of one is because they're bottomless mimosa deal is great and they're not stingy with their pours."}
{"text":"Food is nothing out of this world, but it's pretty good for a gastropub. Sweet potato tots were tasty and burger was cooked well. My one complaint would be the service. Granted, we had a big group, but after the first round of drink orders, server never came back to ask for seconds. Took a while to get our food, longer to get the plates picked up once done, and even longer to get our checks."}
{"text":"As a local I typically avoid RnR because it's jammed packed (great time). If you can get in during the week or at a slower time though it's worth it. Small plates are good for brunch or lunch and they have great drink specials on the weekend.   This time I ordered the salmon salad, my friend had a salad as well. Both were filling and their fish is cooked to perfection. Their portion sizes are hearty and good for sharing (even a salad)."}
{"text":"Awesome appetizers and drinks - go for the buffalo chicken \"lollipops!\""}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I ventured into RnR last night for their first night open.  What a gorgeous building and warm atmosphere.  RnR is going to be the perfect spot for day drinking (due to their abundance of outdoor seating).  My favorite structural aspect of the decor was the wine wall - you can't miss it.  We didn't sample the menu items, just the cocktails.  The cocktails were great - an unusual selection of specialty cocktails. The menu has a a variety of selections without being overly pretentious.   I can't wait to visit again to see how RnR settles in.  I have a feeling this is going to be a great place frequent for lunch and for nights out."}
{"text":"I always have a good time here. I normally come for happy hour but have also gone for brunch on Saturday and bottomless mimosas - awesome! I've had almost everything on their small plates menu and it's never failed."}
{"text":"Went here for a post-conference \"after party / happy hour\". (The fabulous Mortgage Tech Summit. If you're in the real estate biz and missed it, you screwed up...)  The beer selection is marginal at best, though the African Amber was quite tasty.  Someone ordered some dish that was nacho-like -- potato chips with bacon, ranch, \"buffalo sauce\", and blue cheese. It was delightful. (You could put those ingredients on a piece of cardboard and it would be good. It's way better on crunchy potato chips though).  What I liked the best was the great service. Brittany kicked ass. She managed to keep my beer full and did separate checks for a crowd of 30ish that was constantly shifting around. All with a cheery smile.  Why do they call it \"Happy Hour\"? Shouldn't it be \"Happy Hours\"?? I mean really, does anyone stay for just one hour?"}
{"text":"Great burgers and tacos. Casual environment. Brunches on Sunday. Wonderful service. The noise level is off the charts!"}
{"text":"Came in for brunch/lunch on a Friday. We were seated right away and the service was good. But I felt like they were short staffed. Sometimes it was hard to grab our servers attention. I had the bottomless mimosas, which were pretty decent for coming from a pitcher. We also got the nachos and queso was fantastic and balanced our choices out with the southwest salad which was very kindly split for us. Hope to see the top open next time!"}
{"text":"Great and attentive service on a Sunday for Brunch!   I had the breakfast sandwich with a side of home fries....slayed!   Bottomless mimosas is a star in itself, and the waitress was always on it when it came to refills for the group.   Music was bumping, and it feel like a club on a Sunday, I definitely enjoyed myself, maybe a little too much with the mimosas but all in all i give this place 4 solid stars..   ILL BE BACK."}
{"text":"I loved it here. I almost took a star away for slow service from Melissa, but...eh.  DJ, no cover, tons of fun. Someone even brought their baby in here so Im not sure what the rules are. Weirded me out actually, even though the baby had a faux hawk. We started around 2pm and carried into 7pm in the patio. The seating is great, be it cushioned patio chairs, or taller chairs and tables. I got their bloody mary, and it was my first one ever (TEE HEE.) It had a celery stalk in it, stuffed olives, and....a strip of bacon. FREAKING oh my it was so good. So I had about 4 and didnt feel too buzzed. I couldnt taste the alcohol so either it was very well made, or I liked them because they didnt have any alcohol in them at all lol. from 3pm-7pm there was HappyHour, even on Saturday! $5.99 appetizer menu which included sliders, ahi tacos, and other things I cant remember. The Ahi tacos are done in a gourmet'ish fashion. Its not on a tortilla, rather, a slice of jicama (which is spelled incorrectly on their happy hour folds) It was delicious! And Ive got beef with their sliders because the meat to bun ratio was laughable. It was like a meatball inside a burger bun. But veryyyyy tasty. Lastly, their jalapeno mac & cheese was tasty and so popular with our party. I agree, but the heart burn wasnt fun. About Melissa's service...having been a waitress I know its rough handling large parties. We were rolling in the twenties! Nonetheless, her attentiveness was noticeably poor. When I went to find her inside the restaurant to tell her my order, she looked annoyed. Meh. Anyway, my bill after 6 hours of drinking and eating was $50. WHa wha wha whaaaaaaaaat??  I wish I could take these bloody mary drinks home with me!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. The environment is very open feeling. LOTS of televisions! So a great place to catch a game of fight.   Food was pretty good and service was on point."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese and parm fries were outstanding!! Love the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place is crowded. We were told it would be an hour and a half wait. my party of 6 was fine with the wait. 2 and half hours later we still have not been seated. we ask about a vacant table. the only thing is the table behind it has taken all the chairs. they told us there was nothing they can do about them taking the chairs and we were more than welcome to stand at the table and eat. I saw some chairs not being used so I started grabbing them when a blonde employee decided she was going to put her hands on my shoulder and slightly shove stating I can't take the chairs. I'm not even mad that she didn't want me to take the chairs I'm mad she touched me. Unless you're gonna get so drunk you could care less about customer service I don't recommend this place. ps. the food was okay. the appetizers were better than the Buffalo sandwich I ordered. We wanted breakfast , but because we waited almost 3 hours we placed our order 5 mins too late."}
{"text":"This place has a huge rep for Sunday Funday and bottomless mimosas. However, I think it depends on who you are, who you are with, and what you expect to determine what kind of time you will have.   This place is LOUD and full of fist pumping. I think the focus is more on drinks than food (either get there early to eat or eat before you get there). The TVs are ample and the patio is pretty sick. Want to avoid some of the crowds, head upstairs to the second patio or look down into the crowd from the \"overlook\".   We headed outside to the makeshift bar since it wasn't crowded and it had corn hole ripe for the playing. The bartenders were friendly enough. We had a couple of drinks and headed out.  I couldn't see myself there all day for Sunday Funday, but I would totally come back for drinks and sporting event/days."}
{"text":"Whilst enjoying a lovely appetizer of pretzel bites and cheese, I sipped on drinks and enjoyed the Saturday college football games. Their bottomless mimosas are the way to go! Just make sure that you get there with enough time to make it worth the money because it can be quite busy and hard to get a waitress.   My friend and I were relaxed amidst a crowd of recent college graduates, yelling across the table to hear each other. We were prepared for this. Don't expect quiet during the day. Do expect the frat boys behind you to be absolutely wasted and throw up on the floor. Not the restaurant's fault; I'm just trying to warn you what the crowd is like.   If that's not your scene but you're still dying to try this place, I highly recommend going at night. They have a fantastic reverse happy hour with killer apps! One of my favorite places for spring training games."}
{"text":"I agree with others who thought it's a tad overpriced.  A group of us on a Sunday bike ride (the pedal kind) had a pit stop there and for some reason they have happy hour every day of the week - except Sundays.  Spring training season was over so the place was barely a quarter full on a lazy afternoon.  It's a nice place, but 3 domestic beers + tax/tip cost $18.   I'd expect to pay that at a club at night, but it's not a place I'd stop by again during the day for a casual bev with friends.  For some reason, a lot of Old Town places don't seem to realize there's a big difference between the day crowd and the night crowd."}
{"text":"Some girlfriends and I were visiting Scottsdale from Colorado for Spring Training. We went to RNR to watch some March Madness basketball and were lucky enough to have Tommy as our bartender. He was super welcoming, friendly and funny. We had a great time here and he really made it for us, please give him a high-five for us!"}
{"text":"Strolling around Old Town my fiancé wanted to stop in this place - it was super busy and seemed like a cool spot.   We sat on the patio, with loud music (we enjoyed) we were just there for drinks.   The environment was great, very lively with a nice ambiance. Our drinks seemed to take a little extra long but it didn't really bother us as we were taking a break from walking around."}
{"text":"This place was ok. the found made up for NOT being able to get all you can drink mimosas and/or bloody mary's that we were banking on when we went there while visiting. Granted this was because it was St Paddy's Day and they would not have made money off of people drinking bottomless of those. While we were waiting for a table we hand a pretty good spot at the bar to keep the drinks flowing in the meantime.   Our food was great...once we finally got a table. We started with the Hangover Fries...yummmyyyyyy was just what we needed to kick off our day because we were starving because of the busy St Pad's crowd. For my meal, I got the Grilled Buffalo Chicken Sandwich...it was the perfect amount of heat but it was just a little messy. If the buffalo sandwich is a hit in my mind I would get it again if something else doesn't catch my eye. This is a sandwich I would most certainly get again. Other meals on the table included: the Breakfast Taco Plate, Turkey Burger & the Pulled Pork Sandwich. All of which looked delish!  Will try to go again this time for the bottomless special!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Monday for a beer and some food while biking around town. Beer was cold and food was good. Little pricey for bar food , i got the chicken tacos. They were good but pretty small to add up to $6 a taco. It was 2 small tacos for $12. Nothing to go with them like rice or beans. Just chicken tacos. They have a nice patio and our waitress was nice."}
{"text":"I work at a restaurant and therefore I am painfully aware of what good service is. Dan gave it to myself and my friends from the minute we walked in the door. He was friendly, hospitable, and gave some of the best service I've had in a long time. Besides his great service, the food was incredible. The dirty chips were taste bud heaven and the chicken sandwich made me drool. If the food and service isn't enough, they give a discount to other people in the industry on Sunday nights. You can't beat RnR for a good time, delicious food, and wonderful service."}
{"text":"I went here last weekend to meet up with some friends for drinks on a Sunday. Drinks were well priced, and I came at the right time, as it was Happy Hour. The environment was fun, but not too crazy. And the patio balcony is fun to sit and have a drink while people-watching. I haven't tried the food, so if it's good I'll bump it up to a 5 star review. I'll be there earlier next time for the mimosas... and some grub."}
{"text":"This place is best known for their brunch scene - which is pretty awesome.  They have a $20 bottomless mimosas, bloodys or sangria with the purchase of a brunch entree.  They often have a DJ and most people are there to party - which is fun if that's what you're looking for.  Gets packed so get there early if you have a large group."}
{"text":"Holy shnikes! This food was awesome , I brought a vegetarian friend and Brian was sooooo accommodating!  The manager Bryson was also sooo amazing, fixed us up some amazing drinks that were not on the menu . They took the time to get to talk to us, knowing we were in the mood for something light and fruity! They hit the spot in every angle of service! Woo, I'll be back! Sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, great service, okay food...  I had the Sonoran Dog.  The flavor wasn't outstanding, just okay.  I would definitely go here again because they had some other interesting things on the menu."}
{"text":"I tried RnR again, not by choice, by default for a group event. We showed up for HH a little before 6.  We had a party of 8-10 and were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait.  So we grabbed a drink at the bar.  The host was a little scatter brained. When I checked our status about 25 minutes later, he said \"oops, I thought I sat you\"  He had crossed my name off the list.   Really? Was there another party of 10 in the restaraunt... No!  We noticed that he went missing for a while a two large both opened up, back to back.  The server was annoyed that they were sitting empty for so long, so she asked if wanted to sit there... at this point it was about 6:40, so we took her up on it.  She was great, I thought it was going to be a repeat of my last experience with terrible service, but she did make up for it.   I guess all I can say about RnR is if you're going there for HH, get there early and plan on waiting.   It's a neat place but if they don't take care of their service issues they will go under. This is scottsdale, there will be another trendy spot, and their legecy will die."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for lunch on a Wednesday. There were patrons at about 6 of the tables in the bottom section. We sat on the patio right at the edge of the inside to get some of the air conditioning. Our server was available but I wouldn't say overly attentive. She disappear a time or 2 during our lunch, but she was never gone too long. Since the restaurant is right on a well traveled road and there is an open concept, it does get a little loud from car traffic.  I think the term gastropub is an exaggeration for RnR. The menu is fairly small with only 3 main entrees. It is focused more on salads, sandwiches and small plate offerings with some unique side dishes. They do use some unique ingredients in their recipes, but gastropub? With that said, the burgers that my wife and I received were up there with the best burgers we've had in some time. I had the Bleu Cheese Burger and my wife had the Southwest Burger. My burger had bleu cheese (obviously) but the crimini mushrooms and bacon were delicious on the thick, perfectly cooked beef paddy. The green chili on the southwest burger provided a little bite to cut the richness of the beef patty and guacamole. The SW burger was also cooked to near perfection. The parmesan fries were also quite tasty. RnR also has some unique beers on draft, but $7 a draft is quite pricey.  I'd definitely go back, if not for the burgers, to try other menu options."}
{"text":"Bottomless Bloody Marys every weekend? Yes sir, I'll have another!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour sliders we got. Blue cheese sliders with mushrooms and grilled onions. Super yummy.  Half price wine as well. Didn't need to ask me twice. Matt and Tyler had it goin on and we never lacked for a thing. Plus, not so bad to look at. Very kind and attentive to all our needs. Will def be back here next time we come thru Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place -5 stars. The servers and hostesses are beyond rude and the food is disgusting. I went here for the Sunday brunch and it was the worst restaurant experience of my life. Was told it would be one hour for a table, ended up up waiting over two hours. Do not waste you time or money. This place sucks! I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it had a horrid chemical taste, that was confirmed by multiple other people. So disappointed!"}
{"text":"2 Sunday's ago (may 11) i came in with one of my friends in the evening. At first we sat at the patio bar and I ordered a sangria. I can't remember the bartenders name but he was super awesome and makes a very delicious sangria! I bartend too and I switched up my recipe a little bit just because of him! My friend and I moved to a table and ordered the pretzel app which was delicious as well! Our server was Sam and she was awesome! She had good recommendations and gave great service! I like the patio here too. I definitely will be back thanks to the awesome employees and good vibe!"}
{"text":"Small portions & charged an additional \"Processing Tech Fee\" of 6%....nice wait staff, but no mention from them of portion size or the Tech Fee. Limited vegetarian fare. I ordered the veggie tacos & it was $11 for 4 bites of food...no bueno"}
{"text":"We deliberately chose to sit inside because it's cold outside. I can't tell you how many times I asked that the door be closed because it's cold outside and the don't seem to get it. The door is wide open and there's a huge wind tunnel blowing directly I. Our path. We've been here since the place was dead and now it's packed and we can't move. Some important guy with keys said the door has to be left open so people don't get shut in it. Lame. Fix your door then. If I wanted to sit in a wind tunnel, I would be sitting outside.  03/03/17 Here for dinner - great service and DJ. Fun night with friends. Thumb stays down however - they now charge a 3% tax when you use your credit card. A business that appreciates their customers wouldn't squeeze an extra 3% out of their clientele if they really cared. Boooooooo."}
{"text":"I feel the management/owners here felt that \"if you build it, they will come\".  The must have spent a mint on for the location, building and build out but forgot to invest in training their staff.  I asked the waiter to get me a glass of temprarnillo wine and if they didn't have that, then just to bring me an IPA.  20 Minutes later he shows up with an IPA .  I asked for a wine list and right on the list it says they have tempranillo.  You could tell the waiter had no clue what I was asking for.  You would think that their wait staff would at least know their wines since they have pairing suggestions on their menu.  My fiance and I ordered lunch and it took over 1 hr for it to come out!!!  My bread sandwich....excuse me, chicken sandwich came out between 2 huge slices of bread and the smallest chicken breast ever.The potato chips where wet with oil and chewy. .  Everyone in the place had the same type of horrible service. They did not comp the meal after we had to wait over and hour for a sandwich.   I feel bad for this place because you can tell they spent a ton on it but unless their service dramatically improves I can not see this place keeping its doors open for very long."}
{"text":"Not too impressed. Keep in mind that I don't drink so probably isn't my typical scene. Regardless the strawberry French toast wasn't life changing and the hash browns were the exact ones you get at Denny's.  I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I got to try RnR on the roughest brunch day of them all: New Years day.  Think about it. Its the morning after the biggest celebratory night of the year. The air is filled with alcohol and/or puke breath, walk of shamer(s) and hungover folk that either need to desperately jump on the booze horse with a Bloody Mary or desperately need some greasy food to survive the worst (and first!) hungover day of the year.  Needless to say it is a tough day for any brunch restaurant, but RnR managed to survive moderately well.   Arriving at the busiest brunch time ever, 11am, RnR gave us a little buzzer and told us the wait time would be approximately an HOUR. Since we figured everything would be packed, we decided to wait around and hope they would speed up the process. We went upstairs while we waited just because it was too cold outside and too busy by the bar. Unfortunately the staircases smelled like 3 homeless men had fought and died in their own pile of vomit and the RnR crew had forgotten to clean it up. Talk about disgusting.  Bringing in my \"fuck it\" mentality. We go to the patio area and find an empty couch in front of the TV. We figured we could chill out while we waited since no one was being seated there. Within minutes we had a server approach us and take our order. Score. Completely bypassed the hour wait and the buzzer. Me: 1, RnR: 0.   The outside location was perfect even for a freezing cold day: roof heater right above me, comfy couches and tables and the big flat screen right in front of me showing the Michigan game. Our server was super nice and diligent and for as busy as it was, he was sufficiently speedy. I ordered a sun dried and goat cheese scramble with house potatoes and toast. The scramble was decent (nothing to write home about) but lacked a bit of flavor/spice/basic salt and pepper. My latte came out cold but our server was nice enough to take it back and bring me a nice freshly-brewed one. My company didn't care for his breakfast tacos. I guess scrambled eggs in tortilla are not as foodgasmic as you would hope they would be.  I get that RnR is more about the hang-out, clubby-music environment that Scottsdale brunchers aim for. Nothing wrong with that, I would just prefer my food to be a tad more elevated and for my staircases to be a tad less puke-y. I know, I'm such a picky bastard."}
{"text":"Such a fun environment to watch the game. Music playing during commercials, drinks were awesome and appetizers were great. Lots of tables and super friendly staff! Can't wait for the next sporting event to watch here!"}
{"text":"The bacon Bloody Mary is spectacular! Both the mix and garnish are great, but the bacon is pure smokey deliciousness! On sat and sun from 10a - 3p, they are bottomless for $15! And that includes mimosas too! Both or either! Add in a flight of three different breakfast tacos (or four like I did by adding a single green chills pulled pork breakfast taco) and I'm on my way to another wasted day! Sitting at the upstairs bar you can enjoy a killer breeze!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, Love the bottomless mimosas... and the food is great too..."}
{"text":"First time at RnR, met my daughter for lunch. She had been there before so she ordered the Brussels Burger. I went for the Bacon Bleu Burger with Brussels sprouts on the side.   Lunch took about 15 minutes to arrive which was surprising with only about 20 folks in the place. My 'medium' burger was definitely well done, as there was zero pink in the middle. The burger comes on a pretzel bun but with no condiments so it needed mayo, which took another 7 minutes.   The burger itself was tasty. Decent size but $13 was a bit steep. The sprouts were nicely Caramelized and had Caramelized onions and bacon. Good stuff there. My daughters burger was also over cooked ($15).   All in all, they could've done better but I'll try it again."}
{"text":"Everything we tried was excellent. If you want a GREAT surprise, get the chicken lollipops. They are their version of regular wings but they're oh so different. I wasn't wild about the sliders but the chicken and grilled cheese sandwiches were amazing! The waiter accidentally made a mistake on my order, which wasn't a big deal, but he still saw to it that I got a free drink! We've been driving by for awhile and bottom line is I'm so glad we finally stopped!"}
{"text":"*Review for bar only* great place to pregame for giants spring training! Do it!"}
{"text":"I have watched the construction of RnR these past few months and thought it looked pretty cool.  A great place to hang out, enjoy the nice weather on the patio and have a few drinks some food maybe:).  After reading all the bad reviews for RnR I thought I would give it a shot today for lunch.  I was by myself so decided to sit outside at the bar on the first floor.  I really like the look of this place... it is open with lots of places to sit and enjoy the weather.  For lunch I decided on the grilled cheese & bacon with Parmesan fries.  It was not the best grilled cheese I have ever had but it was good and the fries were pretty tasty.   The restaurant is still chaotic trying to figure things out... I would definitely come back again... I might wait until they get their full menu figured out:)."}
{"text":"This place was so fun for brunch!! Great bartender and waitstaff, very attentive.  It gets packed so if you don't like crowds, loud music, or younger people then this might not be the brunch place you had in mind.  There's a DJ spinning on the weekends, everyone is having a good time drinking bottomless mimosas.  Tried the Bloody Mary, it was pretty alright, served with a piece of bacon.  The bottomless mimosas were a tad too juicy for my taste but good nonetheless.  The chips & queso were surprisingly very good!  The dirty chips were also very good!  The pulled pork & hash was underwhelming and not much flavor.  My friend had the tacos and they too looked underwhelming and dry. My other friend had the pulled pork sandwich and it looked really good."}
{"text":"Processing tech fee aka BS fee. I'm already getting bs fees from my cell phone and internet providers, I'm not interested in getting them when I have dinner at a restaurant. What is this fee & when did this come about??"}
{"text":"I have never left RnR feeling unsatisfied. I love coming here especially on sundays. The music is always loud and bumping, the food is really great, and they have all the games playing. If I had to leave the house on Sundays, RnR would be my first to go spot every single time."}
{"text":"Came for brunch b/c of gluten free offerings. Made it very clear to our server that I have Celiac Disease and needed corn torts instead of flour. My meal arrived with flour torts covering the plate. Explained that I needed the whole thing remade. A second server brought out my revised meal and, bless his heart, his girlfriend has Celiac so he understood my issue. He brought corn torts on a separate plate and let me know they were cooked on the same surface as the flour.  So I had to skip the torts. If you are going to have gluten-free offerings on your menu, your servers and your kitchen staff need to be well-versed on what that means or you are at risk for some very sick patrons. Gluten free dining is a fad for some, but for many it is a medical necessity. With their bottomless mimosas, DJ,  and multiple groups of bachelorette parties, this place has more of a night club vibe than a dining establishment."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and lots of TV's to watch games, just mediocre service and if you like cold draft beers don't come here. Even cocktails are short on ice, maybe their ice machine works slow?"}
{"text":"I'm a huge SF Giants fan. Since moving here  14 years ago, I have had to watch games in the east valley without my cheering section.  However we saw the SF signs one day while driving down Scottsdale Rd. I've seen this bar but never knew there was a place for my kind right here. Makes sense since the Giants Spring training park is a few minutes walk away. Most of the bars near by will show baseball but aren't really Giants bars.  This place is awesome I watch one of the World Series games here but was full of Giants fans. The food was amazing and the beer was cold.  I had the Devils Ale and a Moscow Mule. ( not so much for the tummy later ugh!) service was awesome. TV's everywhere and a super gigantic wall TV. Not bad spots.  So excited for spring training. This will be our spot."}
{"text":"Can't beat $13 bottomless mimosas! I love everything about this place and have added it to my must attend bars/brunches when we're in Scottsdale for Spring Training. Go Giants!"}
{"text":"I like this place, but I have one pet peeve that fucked it up. The busser handed our food to the wrong group, once the bartender noticed it was ours, she grabbed it and handed it to us. The fuck? How many hands touched this by now?!"}
{"text":"We had the angus sliders, grilled cheese sandwich and buffalo chicken sandwich.  They all came with bacon on them - good quality and thick sliced but overcooked.  We drowned the sliders with ketchup to try to get some moisture and seasoning into them..  the buffalo chicken sandwich was ok, but sloppy and somehow bland as well.  The grilled cheese had 2 very mild cheeses in it so again pretty mild.  The sweet potato tots and the regular fries were both underdone and not crispy at all, and someone forgot to sprinkle some salt on these.  So somehow we ended up with a very bland meal that had a lot of salt (probably from the bacon).  Not a fan at all of the food!!  Maybe its just a place for drinking?"}
{"text":"I won't be coming here for brunch on Sunday that's for sure. Unless I'm out of there before 11am as the DJ starts doin his thang and it starts to turn into a club. It's great for those that want to have a Sunday Funday in the club, but I guess I'm not into that. I love some Sunday Funday, myself but would rather be able to have a conversation with my friends at the same time. Food was decent from what I remember, the atmosphere just wasn't what I was expecting.   Soooo if I do go back, honestly....I probably won't...or if I do, I'm sure I'll already be pretty lit."}
{"text":"Very cool place on the edge of Old Town Scottsdale.  We had a great breakfast here this morning while watching NFL football.  The atmosphere was open and airy with 2 outdoor patios!  If you check this place out on Google, there is a 20% off coupon that you can bring up on your smartphone - pretty cool!"}
{"text":"This place is a VERY STRONG move for brunch.  But, it's over priced, there's always a line, and the food it good, not great.  But if you can look passed all of that, when you actually sit down... you're going to be in for a solid experience until your finally grow tired of your bottomless mimosas; and want to move on to stronger stuff.  Then it is time to go...   I recommend RnR to anyone in Scottsdale for spring training.  I do not recommend it during football season, you'll miss all of the early games while you wait around outside."}
{"text":"RnR had great happy hour specials and a wide variety of craft beers on tap the only thing I didnt liked here was there margaritas which tasted like pineapple/orange juice but other than that this is a modern place to hang out."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in the food. The juice was not fresh and my breakfast was terrible.  The seating is uncomfortable, it's too loud, and the service wasnt good.  Too many other great places to eat in old town."}
{"text":"When my hubs said there's this place with bottomless mimosas and a live DJ on the weekends I was like, 'whaaaa????' Let's go!  I wasn't disappointed. The food blew me out of the water {I expected sub par} AND it was way above par! Like Birdie status good. I ordered the hash and the hubs got a boring regular egg breakfast and damn. I would eat breakfast there with or without that perk of bottomless mimosas!  I was there with a group of 5 and our service was Awesome...no joke. Rarely was a glass empty and everyone {our group and the whole restaurant} were in good spirits.   I'll def be back and will def bring out of town guests here!  //cheers//"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting mixed reviews....  It is a SF Giants bar as it is down the street from their Spring Training field.  My husband and I just got back from their Happy Hour.  I think it's 4-7pm, didn't say anywhere on their website.  We each got a frozen margarita (pre-made from a machine), after being told their \"Frose\" drink machine wasn't working.  I'll be coming back just to try that - frozen rose champagne and strawberry puree.  We shared their Dirty Chips - if you like sauces, get this.  They drench these house made potato chips in buffalo sauce and a fair amount of ranch/sour cream.  I had their RnR sliders (mini cheeseburgers with bacon), my husband had their slider trio (1 RnR, 1 pulled pork, 1 bacon and bleu cheese).  $31 for all that during HH.  I want to come back and check out the Sunday Brunch as I am on a mad hunt for the best (and cheapest) Bottomless Mimosa bar in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Anybody have any suggestions?"}
{"text":"No camo? Wow.  Great to know the owners of this place have a strong stance against the US military.   Run, don't walk, away from this anti-American establishment."}
{"text":"Love the new bar smell!! Our waiter was very helpful. And OMG Chicken Lollipops rule!!! Think I will head down there now for a drink on the patio. Cool Spot!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Friday after a Giants spring training game. Happy hour with 1/2 priced drinks from 3-7PM...woot! Also, 1/2 price appetizers. Amy took care of our group and was fantastic. I would ask for her if you want a fun night. Sit upstairs to avoid the crowd. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"RnR is a casual but trendy restaurant. It does a great job reimagining the former space, which may have been a warehouse. I liked how the garage door to what may have been the loading dock area is the entrance to the outdoor seating area from inside the restaurant. The restaurant also has an upstairs seating area and lounge seating area on the bottom floor toward the back of the restaurant. Since I'm from the Bay, I was loving the SF Giants flag over the bar.   I can totally see RnR being the hot spot for brunch. The music was loudly blasting top 40 hits, and at 10am you can buy bottomless mimosas or bloody marys. There are TV's everywhere, so this would also be a great spot for watching sports. Sunday Funday or Shitshow Sunday? Decide your fate.   Loved the place, but I was super disappointed with my order. I ordered the breakfast tacos plate, which included potato + egg taco, bacon + egg taco, and chorizo + egg taco. All 3 tacos have cheddar in them. The food was basic AF. I can't believe I spent money on food I not only could have easily made at home but could have made so much better. The tacos were exactly as they were advertised, so I guess it was my bad for expecting them to be anything more. No creativity whatsoever, and the tacos lacked flavor or saltiness. Even the taco with chorizo tasted bland to me despite chorizo generally being flavorful. The side of salsa that came with the tacos had no kick to it. I had to drench the tacos in hot sauce, which I think was Cholula. It's kind of sad when the side of fried potatoes, bell peppers, and onion was the best thing on the whole plate. I'm hoping that I just chose wrongly, so I won't totally count out RnR next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Visited RnR on my Bachelorette Trip this past weekend with about 13 other girls! The service was prompt and friendly! Anytime a busy place can sit a large group and split the check without issues is awesome! I got the signature RnR burger and it was very good! And thats coming from a Chicago girl who loves Portillos! This burger was def delicious! Also frozen rose was a sweet treat! Our server was so kind - I'm disappointed I forgot her name but she was delightful and congratulated me on my upcoming wedding! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is FUN. Came here on a Sunday to kill the morning with bottomless mimosas and had a fantastic time doing it. RnR was spacious and had misters and fans throughout the patio and balcony, so chilling in the hot Phoenix sun was easy. A dj was spinning some pretty bumping beats and the waitress was generous with the mimosa pours.   Two people at the table ordered the hangover killer and I really wish I had gotten that. Looked and smelled delicious. I got the scramble which wasn't nearly as great.   I was definitely here for the atmosphere and fun though, so I didn't mind the scramble. Had a great time with friends and that's the vibe I'll remember RnR for."}
{"text":"Came a while ago with my boyfriend and finally getting around to reviewing. If you're newly 21, just want to be a part of the old town party scene, and couldn't care less about the quality of your drinks, then this is the place for you. I was excited about some bottomless mimosas, but turned out to be a total waste of money as I couldn't even get through one glass of the cheapest champagne mixed with nasty ass ocean spray orange juice (maybe that's what's expected with bottomless mimosas?). As far as service goes, our server was okay, however I made my way downstairs looking for the bathroom, couldn't find it, so I found a server and literally in the middle of me asking her where it was she saw someone she knew, completely blew me off, and started chatting with this person as I just stood there watching in disbelief. I was so put off I forgot about the bathroom and returned to my seat. Needless to say my boyfriend and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We stopped by here just out of curiosity. It was a pretty cool place. A dj playing good music, packed place with morning party animals and a few bars inside and out. We only ordered beers so I'm not sure how good their drinks are. Service was great though. Both ladies at the bar were super attentive! If you like that sorta daytime clubish feel then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Love this happy hour!! So great for catching up on a nice summer day. The atmosphere is great and the happy hour food is very affordable. I could eat their Animal fries all day and their Margarita flavors are very original, try the jalepeno mango! RnR is also great for watching your favorite team play, they are a Giants baseball bar."}
{"text":"Stopped in at the suggestion of friends and so glad we did. I had the shrimp tacos and my husband had the bleu cheese hamburger. Possibly one of the best burgers I have tasted. Kaitlyn was our server and she was on top of our largish group of 8.  Good selection of beers and cocktails are good, I had the  \"pair way to heaven\" which was very good. Definitely a must do."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, servers, and food preparation.  The result of a Manhattan bar and restaurant falling out of the sky and landing on a dude ranch.  I could do some damage to my brain cells here.  I had a couple of appetizers and again - well prepared and the kind of food you would get in SF, LA, or more likely Manhattan.  I'll go back and try it again and likely update my review with more detail - as I don't recall what I ate right now."}
{"text":"Brunch 6/2/18 Server had dark long hair and served our table that was closest to the bar.  She was excellent and was so friendly and knew we just wanted to have a good time.  She kept our classes full and was very attentive.   Went to Saturday Brunch with bottomless mimosas and had the most amazing time.  Great food and excellent staff all around.  Highly recommend for your group!!"}
{"text":"Went in on labor day 2011 at around 1:30pm with my fiance. Was told the kitchen was backed up TWO HOURS!!!! What the hell is up with that?? Who the hell do they have back there preparing the dishes?? That is a bunch a crap. If they can't handle being busy then they need to get outa the kitchen. Will never go back there. Very disapointed:("}
{"text":"Good food, sweet potato tots are delicious. Still not used to the water in Scottsdale, tastes funny unless its filtered. Our server was great. We ordered the turkey burger and split it, it was more than enough for both of us! Would go back."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times for lunch with friends...  The margaritas were good and both times I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, which was excellent.   However, the service is lacking a little bit here. If they can up that just a bit, the place should very well. The location and both patios are great.   *Do note that the \"small plates\" are most definitely small and for the most part, not enough to satisfy your hunger. A friend ordered the ahi tacos and we couldn't help but laugh when they arrived at the table."}
{"text":"RnR used to be the awesome place with an awesome staff. Now  i have no idea who did the hiring but their new manager JJ should not be working in the service industry. She is not a people oerson, she doesnt smile, she scowls, its quite sad to come into this restaurant when she is managing. I tried to ask her something about the menu and it was i  was below her and she gave me this attitude smart ass answer. She needs to get herself a job where she wont be dealing with customers. JJ is such a sour faced entitled manager, who needs to get over herself and start treating her staff, her customers with respect."}
{"text":"Awesome experience both dinner and breakfast. We were lucky to have Erika Marie as our waitress helping out with our afternoon to do list. Be back again for sure."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for happy hour! Delicious food and drinks, great happy hour deals, 1/2 off wine(!), daily Facebook specials and great deals for those that work in the industry. I have yet to go for breakfast or lunch, or the bottomless bloody marys and mimosas on the weekends. That's next on my list. They also have great live music, especially the guitarist on Monday nights. Can't get enough!"}
{"text":"Too loud to talk with friends or family. Food is good though. I wouldn't go here for a date because of the noise."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing rock shrimp tacos - and on Sunday and Monday you can get half off bottles of wine. One of the best outdoor patios ever because it sits on Scottsdale road and you can people watch all afternoon sipping wine!"}
{"text":"Here visiting from Vegas for a concert. There was a slight wait but Bryan Willson, our server made it well worth the wait. He was definitely on point! He was one of the most entertaining servers I've ever had and hands down will be the reason I come back here next time I visit. Oh, the food was also delicious!"}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT Large indoor and outdoor seating. This place is definitely meant to have a good time or hang out with friends.  DOG FRIENDLY! This is a huge plus and deserving of six stars.   SERVICE Brian is amazing, thank you!  MENU I'm certain they have everything you'd want at a bar/restaurant and then some.  SALAD Blackened Salmon -- This is definitely more of an entree. The salmon is seasoned amazingly and the spinach salad on the side is refreshing.   SANDWICHES  Pulled Pork -- this is good and with a sweet twist. Comes with awesome Parmesan cheese fries.   Pesto Chicken -- this is the better of the two."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has 3 stars. It was like a club at 11am. So if youre looking for a quiet lunch spot, move along.   THe music was loud, the crowd was pretty good looking and the drinks and food were great. Bottomless mimosas, and bloodies (with bacon in them!!) and good down home southern style breakfast and burgers.   I also have to hand it to our waitress Mandi. She was really helpful, super nice and hilarious to boot!   check it out."}
{"text":"I stopped in to meet up with friends for brunch around 12:30 on a Saturday. I was informed over an hour wait and they would inform me via text when our table was ready. There was a DJ on the patio which was cool. As I waited I was reminded of why I am no longer in college and thrilled about it. I found it to be rather young. My friends joined me and we had a round before departing. I realized later I didn't cancel our request for a table but I never did get that text message. Oh well. Lessons learned."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I haven't been all that happy with Scottsdale places, we've encountered some very unfriendly staff and pretty bad food. But with RNR we were finally impressed. I am somewhat of a baked-pretzel connoisseur. I ordered the pretzel bites with mustard and wow. Not only were they served differently than any other pretzels I've tried but they were absolutely delicious and the stone ground mustard was DEVINE. My boyfriend even used some on his sliders (which were also really good). The staff was energetic, really friendly and very attentive. We asked if they could put the Broncos game on and they did. We were very happy with our experience! I didn't get any of the staff names but we were there on Saturday, August 29th between 7pm and about 8:30pm. We sat at the bar."}
{"text":"I went here this weekend for my roommate's 22nd birthday. We had an AMAZZZZING time. The staff was so attentive, the food was delicious, and the mimosas/bloody marys kept coming!   First of all, the amazing GM was able to give us a reservation on a Sunday during brunch when they typically don't do reservations. He was so kind and accommodating and it really made my roommate's birthday special.   We sat down and we all ordered the bottomless mimosa/bloody mary deal and let me tell ya, it's worth every penny. Both were delicious and well made - the perfect juice-to-alcohol ratio. I ordered the Amish french toast, and it was soooo good. My friends ordered the omelet, pork hash, pancakes, and a lot of other really yummy food. Everything I tried was delicious!   The atmosphere was loud and fun, which was exactly what I wanted for my friend's birthday. We all had so much fun! I will 100% be back and I am already telling all my friends to go if they haven't been already.   And again - THE SERVICE WAS AMAAAAZING. I can't get over how attentive and awesome our waitress was, as well as the rest of the staff. It was super busy but our drinks were always filled and everything came out perfectly.   11/10 recommend for a fantastic, fun Brunch spot."}
{"text":"I have not had any food, but went there last Sunday to watch the Ohio State game. I met up with some friends, who had claimed an outdoor bar. I love the vibe in there. There is great energy, the design is very nice, modern, clean. We were on the patio so we had a lot of fun people watching.  Unfortunately we had a little weasel of a server, who, I think was new to the waiting game. He really didn't have a way with people and seemed incredibly paranoid about who was on which tab, where people in our group were going. We explained that we were there to watch the game, he had credit cards on all the tabs. We weren't going anywhere. It was very annoying.   But the rest of the service was good. It seemed to be well staffed and some people I was with ordered some apps and said they were good. The food looked good, so I'll be back to try it one day. Hopefully the new server will loosen up so we can all relax and have a nice time."}
{"text":"Came to Scottsdale for my friends birthday and it's always a great time. My first time here at RnR and I have to say it's pretty awesome. Great atmosphere and great drink selections! When we first walked in I already loved the vibe. The security guard with the big ass beard was super cool and the hostess was really nice too. They had a great sense of humor when we were making jokes, or even when they made jokes in the first couples minutes we met.   FOOD ORDERED: PULLED PORK HASH: let me tell you, this meal comes with a lot of food! Definitely worth splitting between two people. The pulled pork was pretty good. Came with eggs and veggies and toast. Certainly something I would recommend getting to eat.  CHORIZO BREAKFAST TACO: almost looks like a del taco taco but most definitely tastes way better. Very simple with cheese chorizo and egg. Wasn't too bad.   SERVICE: Well let's start by saying all the servers are gorgeous AND they're on top of the endless mimosas! Our server was really nice and had a pretty cool personality. As said earlier, hostess and security guards were chill.   Definitely a spot I would recommend. No clue how this place has 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"So I am writing this review after trying the restaurant out 3 times now.   1st Experience: I was with a Bachelorette Party on St. Patrick's Day 2010 and we stopped into RnR. The bartender was friendly & we had great service. Overall a good experience in the 30-45 minutes we were there for a drink & a shot at the bar.   2nd Experience: A friend and I decided to try out there bottomless Mimosa's for $10 one Sunday morning. I recall the Animal fries being tasty & the mimosa's were alright. Nothing special, but worth the money as long as you had 2 or more. The service was so-so. Overall a fairly good experience.  3rd & Final Experience: I can honestly say that today we had the worst service I have ever experienced in a restaurant in my 27.5 years on this third rock from the sun. To begin, we sat at our table on the patio for 30 minutes before I finally called the hostess over to see if we even had a server for our table. She informed us that there was & she went to find the server. After 5 or 10 minutes she comes back and informed us that they are \"swamped\" and that she will be taking our drink order for the server. Mind you this was lunch on a Thursday afternoon. This place wasn't anywhere near \"swamped\". She brings us our waters and informs us a few minutes later that she will also be taking our food order & that she will pass it on to our server whom we still have not seen at this point. As she starts to take our order our server finally shows up at the table. He apologizes and takes our order. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time & the order was correct. Nobody brought us silverware, so I had to request it. Then I realized there was no salt or pepper on our table so instead of letting my food get cold while I waited for our server to reappear, I asked the table next to us if we could borrow theirs. Our water glasses were left empty for 15-20 minutes. And it took forever for our server to bring us our check after we requested it and then it took him equally as long to pick up the check with our payment inside it. I was in absolute shock that nobody offered us a complimentary beverage, appetizer, or dessert for the horrible serve we received which they were completely aware of considering how they kept apologizing. We paid our full $27 bill & left... Our lunch didn't just cost us money, it cost us almost 3 hours of our afternoon. I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Went last night with a couple friends and I'm glad I did! Food is amazing, Sangria is amazing and our server, Courtney, was also amazing!!! Fun atmosphere, I definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Had a great time on Sunday for football. Bartenders were AMAZING and so patient with all of the football fans requesting specific games on different tv's. Food and drinks were great and the DJ that started playing at 12:30 was really good! Had a ton of fun, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for a Saturday or Sunday brunch! Love the $15 bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's!!"}
{"text":"Egg white and turkey breakfast with a spicy Bloody Mary. Waitresses were very friendly! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a must for any recovering Greek in search of some charbroiled goodness, mediocre drinks and raucous live DJ sets.   Along with your well tequila and pitchers of bud light, make sure to sure to order the house special: the southwest charcoal burger. This masterpiece is cooked to crispy perfection. Don't even worry about ordering it medium or rare. The talented cooks at R&R take extra care of the burger patty, providing that dark, toasty texture that we all crave.  Immaculate conception is an understatement; it evokes a natural smoky flavor resembling the time your aunt cooked those steaks and left them in the microwave for 2 hours.   R&R is on to something and we should all be grateful that mad cow isn't a problem anymore. I don't know that this is the first southwest charcoal burger ever cooked, but it definitely had that unique burnt flavor that will keep me coming back. I can't wait until the next time I get to enjoy those ashy kingsford chunks in my mouth."}
{"text":"Love it here! Best Sunday brunch mimosa deal in the city! So much fun, and it's always totally packed. It's so trendy and sometimes even hard to get in....which I think makes it that more elusive. The indoor/outdoor floor plan is cool. The bartenders are always paying attention to your mimosas and aren't skimpy on anything, which is rare. Nice bartenders at a high volume restaurant are actually super hard to come by, so this was refreshing and I felt like I totally got my moneys worth!"}
{"text":"I am a local and have never checked out this bar before. Definitely coming back! The bottomless mimosas on Saturday and Sunday's are a reasonable price the staff is friendly and helpful. Wasn't too overcrowded. A bartender named Eric Kemp served and was awesome!! He made sure my friends and I were good on drinks and water. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Good food, slightly pricey for the type of casual restaurant. Burger are good. Loud w/ DJ on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Service with a side of attitude! 20 minutes to get a beer, 40 min to get a burger. What a shame because the food is delicious but the service is absolutely horrendous."}
{"text":"So, the R n R is more like a fruit fly haven. I was there yesterday and had the sliders ( which were as dry as the bartenders personality) and the jalapeño Mac and cheese( which should have been called the milk and cheese with a few bread crumbs. I thought when I  walked in, the place was cool as f#^k, but after the bland food and horrible service, I recommend the jack in the box around the corner. Stay away from this place unless you want fruit flies and bad service at the bar."}
{"text":"My wife and I met another couple on a Saturday to watch a football game. We only ordered appetizers and drinks, but we enjoyed what we got. The atmosphere was great, but our server wasn't too engaging and we had to ask a couple times for another round."}
{"text":"WARNING! If you order a bloody mary they will stick bacon in it! For all my meat eating company, this was wonderful, but for me I was a bit annoyed, I just wish I had known...now that I do know I will nicely ask for the vegetarian bloody mary next time. As far as the food goes, my whole group found it pretty average, but with the second floor patio seating the premo people watching atmosphere will have us coming back."}
{"text":"I have some mixed feelings here but am still going to give this place a good rating, mainly because of their breakfast...  The positives: -Really good and not that expensive breakfast -The building is designed and decorated in a cool fashion -The patio seating with the TV's is really nice. -Great central location -Lots of pretty girls  The negatives: -Tons of douchebagery... almost overwhelming. By douchebagery I mean Ed Hardy wearing loud mouthed wannabe flashy type people who think they are too cool for school. -Service is pretty bad, mainly this blonde dude who I swear to god must have drank paint thinner as a child. I did have 1 out of 3 experiences there with reasonable service but the other 2 were pretty horrific as the servers just sort of hang out at the bar and don't come check in very often.  If you want a bloody mary and some good breakfast, it's a good spot, but I am not a big fan of the happyhour/dining/bar side of it."}
{"text":"Its my second time here and right from the start we got told by the hostess that we could not sitio at the second level, its a beautiful sunny day on a Sunday afternoon and the spot to be its up in the second floor with the view of scottsdales oldtown streets and view of the mountains, so we decided to go upstairs anyways and met Austin the bartender and took care of us."}
{"text":"I'm in love. RnR has made its way deep into the corridors of my heart and stomach by providing good wine, amazing food, great service and optimal people watching from the upstairs balcony.   After the Giants game (beating Cleveland!) we hopped onto one of the handy dandy golf carts and headed into downtown Scottsdale to join other Giants fans as we reveled in the glory of a well-earned win. Not knowing the town, we left it up to our chauffeur to drop us at the perfect location of RnR.   There are three bars strategically placed throughout the massive building. We opted for the bar upstairs on the balcony overlooking the street so that we can watch the cars, golf carts and people making their way down this bustling thoroughfare. As I walked by one of the tables, I spied and smelled a delicacy that was a must order for me - Animal Fries. Parmesan fries mixed with sweet potato fries, smothered with cheese and topped with BBQ pork. Delicious!!!!  We left here and went to two other bars in town, but RnR was my favorite. Come for the good food, great service and awesome people watching."}
{"text":"Wandering around the avenue killing time we were getting hungry when the aroma of beef wafted by my nose...that and some pumping jams.  \"We have got to follow the smell and sound and find out what this place is!\" I exclaimed.  Led us to RnR.  It was a Sunday and the noise was loud on the lower level as the games were on.  The host asked us - after seeing the look on my face - if we wanted to go upstairs where it wasn't as loud.  YES!  Upstairs on the outside balcony overlooking the street in November? YES! It was still loud but I didn't care I was enjoying the warmth.  I had the slider sampler and hubs had a blue cheese burger;  Beef good - beef friend! It was all very tasty.  Hubs also had the dirty chips.  The chips weren't bad, just a bit too sloppy for me, he ate them up.   Then the live DJ started spinning some tunes I hadn't heard in awhile and all I could do was stand up and start head nodding and singing along.   I noticed they had some good looking breakfast items and that day the drink special appeared to be a really big pitcher of mimosas.  Good times!  When we return to Scottsdale we will hit them up again."}
{"text":"Quick lunch stop and stayed for more. Go to fav is now the veggie tacos. Not tacos at all! They are a blend of portabella, peppers and sprouts with a spicy Asian peanut sauce and served on the thinnest sliced jicama instead of a tortilla. Phenomenal. Paired with a house salad and you are good to go."}
{"text":"Love this place! Sunday's here are the best.... Bottomless mimosas and a great time! Great food too!"}
{"text":"Sam was our server...best GD service ive had since 1998! Drink specials were great. Really good atmosphere and balcony but there are a lot of b.a.b.s So if youre ok with that then GO"}
{"text":"I can only speak to the weekend brunch craziness of this place. Ever head of the saying, \"Drink more to work off last night's hangover?\" Well every customer between 11am and 3pm definitely lives by this! It's the usual Scottsdale/ ASU college crowd with bottomless mimosas for $15 with the purchase of an entrée. The food is good and plentiful with a large variety for breakfast or lunch. You have the option to sit inside, outside on the patio or upstairs. If you want to be able to talk to the people you came with- sit outside! The DJ plays SO LOUD you can barely tell that waiter what you want. There is plenty of parking in the garage behind the restaurant and I'd get out early before the drunks stumble around."}
{"text":"Quite the scene here as to be expected in this part of town. Decent service. Bottomless mimosas were okay. Food was okay."}
{"text":"Best place to enjoy football on Sunday's and bottomless mimosas. Their nachos and breakfast plates are delightful. However, they could use better parking and add tables."}
{"text":"Lily Zobel is super great. Awesome service and really cool vibes. Coming back here for sure.  Xoxo, Lily Zobel"}
{"text":"Mewh.  I guess I have been in places with a higher fraternity/hungover/douchey vibe for brunch on a Sunday at 11AM, but not many.  The food was decent, a little fancier than your typical diner fare, with a little bit of flair thrown in for good measure (and higher prices).  Probably won't be returning unless I am desperate."}
{"text":"Loooove this place for brunch. My only complaint is that you have to be there at like 9:30am or you'll be waiting all day for a table to open up."}
{"text":"Ahhhh RnR.  The only place in Scottsdale I've been to where I've had champagne spilled on me repeatedly by hammered 20 something year old girls at 10AM, watched a dude throw up in the urinal by 10:30AM and then almost get into a fight with the drunken friend of the aforementioned champagne fairy by 11AM.  My experience was probably fueled by their bottomless drinks.  The music is oftentimes obscenely loud dance/electronic which I don't necessarily mind.  I'd say the service is extremely hit or miss here.  You have the typical \"I'm a server in Scottsdale and that somehow makes me important\" slow to do anything waiter that takes 20min to get your drinks, 45 to give you your now cold food and quickly gives you your tab assuming you'll tip at very least 20% because god knows that downtown Scottsdale apartment with 3 of their friends ain't going to pay for itself.  Oh and the annual Instagram trip is coming up and god knows those are expensive.  The food is similarly hit or miss, but typically pricey for what it is.  I've had a great burger there and then seen some items come out they couldn't pay me to eat.  I think you go here if you're looking to people watch, get into a fight with drunken post teens, bro out with your ho out.  I wouldn't come here for a relaxing brunch with friends."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some drinks after the giants game. Super fun vibe and great service. We had a party of 7 and they found a spot for us immediately. Def try the frozen margaritas. 2 of those had me feeling really good! Also tried the casa amigo tequila and kilt something beer . All thumbs up."}
{"text":"Cute, but not too impressed. The only reason I'd really go back is for those Sweet Potato tots. Delicious! Reasons to go: the sweet tots, decent food, and a very beautiful restaurant, contemporary and great view of Scottsdale rd. Reasons not to go: kind of pricey for the portion size, unorganized wait staff, and no hostess at the hostess stand....ever. Throughout our lunch I kept looking at the hostess stand and no one was ever there except to wave us goodbye as we were leaving. About the unorganized wait staff, our waitress asked another waitress to bring our the last plate to our table and we watched her do a lap around the restaurant before she realized it was for our table.   The service was alright, but it should have been exceptional considering it was after the lunch rush. I got the grilled chicken sandwich. It was tasty, but I'd rather go to Olive & Ivy for a WAY bigger portion with the same great taste, save a few bucks, and free bread/pesto.    The drink menu looked fun, but on my lunch hour wouldn't have been the best time for it."}
{"text":"I've been here a thousand times but hadn't been recently.  I took my cousin who is visiting to have happy hour before the giants game last night.  We were put on the waiting list and gave our cell phone number so we went to the bar for drinks.  The bar was really crowded and loud because of spring training so even with my phone on the highest volume I didn't hear my phone ring (Who thinks it's a good idea to call people to let them know their table is ready in a crowded restaurant?).  I noticed they called me, closed out our tab and was at the hostess stand within TWO minutes of the call.  The hostess notified us that they gave our table away because we didn't pick up the call. I was upset that within TWO minutes of calling us they had the time to call someone else and seat them, while we were closing our tab out.  Instead of apologizing and assuring us we would be seated next, the hostess gave a lot of attitude and blamed US.  When I explained why I was upset she was frazzled and rude.  Then when we finally got sat it was at a table over by the back bar that was way too crowded and extremely uncomfortable, it was as if other guests were eating with us.  The only good thing I have to say is our waitress was wonderful.  She was funny, engaging and we made sure to tip over 20% to show our appreciation.  However because of how rude the hostess was, I won't ever go back personally or to take family or clients.  Just terrible customer service and not once was there any notion of apology or understanding."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim! We were in Scottsdale for a day and it was HOT AS HELL, I needed a DRANK! As we were walking down the street we stumbled upon this fabulous place. Had no expectations nor did I read reviews beforehand. This was a pleasant experience! Since we were out-of-towners we had to  see what was up! Happily it was happy hour so we ordered 3 MARGs, I was TWISTED after only one- nice and STRONG! Nice snacks to accompany. Very pleased w service(sorry dude, I forgot your name!), ambience good, food good, what more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"We went here for some frose before dinner and had a great experience. The only reason for the 4 stars is that the waitress didn't really seem very present/know the menu. We asked her a few questions because we did want to get an appetizer before dinner but she couldn't give us any answers so we just went for drinks.  I do recommend the frose though - it was delicious but it does come in a small glass for $8 per glass. They do have a lot of drinks specials each day so maybe that's the way you should do it. They have plenty of outdoor seating and fans for those hot summer days!"}
{"text":"THe FOOD is GREAT, but the SERVICE is REALLY BAD.  We were even giving it a second chance but the service was still typical snotty Scottsdale service which we don't appreciate seeing as we live here in Old Town. Brittany served us at the outside bar. She seemed to know everyone else around us & was friendly & talkative to them. She gave us our food then went to the other side of the bar, we sat there still needing silverware & napkins. When my husband asked her for a napkin she tossed a few bar napkins toward him. I pointed to the pile of cloth napkins rolled around silverware and asked if we could have those. She put them on the bar without looking up at us or saying anything. We were using a 'daily deal' maybe that's what spawned the bad attitude but doesn't that defeat the point of those to get people in there...or in our case BACK in there for another shot?? We are really good tippers & always tip from the original amount not the 'deal' amount but Brittany got nothing from us. Management needs to know that their servers are hurting their reputation & turning off locals who should be repeat business.  We won't make the same mistake a third time."}
{"text":"Decent food (for bar food) Service was slow. Waiter more interested in talking to staff rather than checking up on us or getting us more drinks. Not too big of a deal. Would probably go back but its average but better than some of the awful food at some sports bars in the Valley.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great place to go to if you like American food.  I like a good burger every once in a while and enjoyed the  RnR burger.  I split it with a friend of mine and ordered the fries to go with it.  I kind of wished I hadn't shared my meal.  I could have finished the whole thing.  Service was fine. Will be back."}
{"text":"I came here for a corporate function on a saturday and i tell you what I am a fan! The DJ was outstanding. We decided to have the never ending mimosas and mind erasers so i can't really be a good judge of character on the food due to being a little tipsy but i did have the breakfast taco plate and it was pretty darn good, i will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast on a beautiful Sunday morning.  Wanting to try something new, so we came across RnR.  They have a nice large patio, but there was a wait.  So we sat at the bar.  The menu was small for breakfast, but whatever as long as i get some food.  The bartender ask us what we like to drink, then she ask if we wanted to keep it open.....  Well, we're having food here! She continue to ask for credit card.  Really?!! I understand if it was sat. night at a bar, but it's Sunday morning and you can keep your eyes on your bar so people won't walk off?!  Breakfast was limited, so i order a Grill Cheese Sandwich.  The bartender came back and said they're not serving lunch just yet.  Come on its a Grill Cheese!  and if you're just serving breakfast put a time on there so everyone would know.  Some how he talked them into it.  Let just say that i won't be in there anytime soon.   Top it off the bill came out wrong too...."}
{"text":"This place is a tons of fun for big groups on Saturday and Sunday mornings (9am-noon) as it's a great party spot with a DJ. Food and drinks are definitely good and the crowd is awesome! The biggest downside is when it's busy on the weekends (it is jam packed between those hours) it's extremely hard to get drink orders from your server (I.e. refilling the bottomless mimosas) & if you manage to get an order in it will certainly take 10 minutes for the drink. Nonetheless, we return and will continue returning for the party!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere!! Staff always goes above and beyond. Daniel, Dakota, and JJ have this place working like a well oiled machine, even on their amazingly busy Sunday's! They keep us coming back!"}
{"text":"Went there for Happy Hour with some friends.  Ordered the chicken lollipops which tasted good, so no problems there.  The problem was the bartenders. When we arrived there wasn't 1 person sitting at the bar, which I immediately noticed since I usually prefer sitting at the bar anyways.  I soon found out why- the bartenders were extremely unattentive- almost to the point where it looked like one of the ladies was actively trying to avoid customer eye contact.  The first time we went up there she was busy looking down drying wine glasses and not surveying the bar at all.  I had to walk around and repeatedly say 'excuse me' before I could get her attention and even then- no smile, no offer of water, nothing- just \"what do you need\"? Followed by bringing the drinks.  Later, when we went to close our tab, one of the bartenders was in the corner by the well chatting with the barbacks (clearly joking around and tossing the towel back and forth, not about work) and the lady from before had her back to the bar and was busy texting on her phone.  By this time the bar had filled up so we waited to see how long it would take for one of them to turn around and check the bar or for a manager to walk by and see what was going on, but after 5 minutes we decided to cut our losses and once again yell to get her attention.  Overall it''s a nice place with a great patio and nicely priced happy hour drinks; their customer service at the bar was just severely lacking and ultimately that falls on the management who should be training better and walking by to check on how they are doing."}
{"text":"I have been here three times now.  Each time I brought a different guest. I have become a huge fan of their Green Chili Burger (I cant remember the correct name).  Sweet potato tater tots and the sweet potato french fries are great.  The chicken sandwiches rock, as well.    I like the venue. And, I have always liked the service.  I keep coming back here because everyone has enjoyed it, found something on the menu they like, and I often crave that burger.  Give RnR a shot!!"}
{"text":"I come to this place every few weeks I love the atmosphere of this place. Good music , good quality food and good service .   I usually order the Animal Fried very big meal for a Small Plate item on the menu.   Can't beat the price for the quality of the food.    This will be my regular place for a good lunch ."}
{"text":"A very beautiful building, great location, hard working servers and good food.....a hard to beat combination."}
{"text":"Nice open and airy place. Good music mix and friendly staff. Food is great. Ahi tacos are a must, the best I've ever tried. House margarita is really food for a house."}
{"text":"We walked in and not a single employee greeted us to the restaurant, instead the security demanded for our IDs. We were seated promptly and ordered our food and drinks. The waitress didn't write down any of our 3 orders and kept returning to double check what our orders were. When we received our food in a timely matter, each of the orders had something wrong with them, but the sangria was very good!   I ordered the Southwest burger cooked medium well. What I got was not medium well at all, check the photo! It was THAT rare throughout the entire burger. When I told the general manager about it, he acted as if he could not care less that the meal was dangerously messed up. He informed me that he would let the kitchen know in a rather unenthused tone and that was all. I apologized for taking his time.   Would I return? Not after the way the manager treated such a mess up. The burger was clearly 3 stages from medium well. I wouldn't even go back for the sangria."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin. Sat down, the table was full of other ppls drinks... our server told us weird things we didn't need to know.. the food came out wrong... and took forever...they didnt have things on the menu... marg machine wasnt working... was given the wrong bill... not a great experience. I hear if you come before 2pm it's better and they have happy hour mimosas"}
{"text":"The very definition of an average brunch.  My omelet was pretty decent, and it's nice that they let you choose a bunch of ingredients if you want to.  However the breakfast potatoes are extremely weak, fairly bland and underseasoned and are probably not hand cut and prepared.  They are mixed with an uninspiring blend of green peppers.   The rest of my table seemed to feel about as enthusiastic as I did about their breakfast burritos.  The service was also pretty slow.  Despite the awesome patio and pretty good eye candy among the patronage here, this place is definitely one you can skip."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on Saturday night pretty late. The ambiance was nice - everyone was laughing and having a good time. I love the way this place is set up. The drinks were what you'd except with prices you'd also expect in Scottsdale.  Our server was great! She was attentive without being obnoxious and she was conversational. Not sure what her name was but she was blonde, working Saturday night, and had a black dress with a sheer polka dot top part. She spoke of the next day's breakfast well so my boyfriend and I will be returning here for brunch and a Bloody Mary. :)"}
{"text":"A tried and true, albeit loud, spot to gather with friends or coworkers and located in a prime spot in Oldtown Scottsdale.  Pretty average food but I don't imagine that's what you are coming here for."}
{"text":"RnR is such a fun place to get your brunch on because the music is loud, the food comes out quickly, and on Saturday and Sunday they offer $15 bottomless mimosas. Also, the space is very appealing. I love their outdoor patio on the first floor, and how roomy the interior is. I had never been upstairs until my most recent visit, but that is a good place to sit if your group wants to be a little more private. I'm giving a fourth star because my server, Cassie, was awesome. She made sure that everyone in my group always had a full mimosa, and took great care of us by starting individual tabs for everyone so that we could move around the table and restaurant easily. I'd never had a waitress take our credit cards at the beginning of the meal, but it made so much sense after our group was on mimosa #5 and we were running downstairs to request songs from the DJ and mingle with our friends sitting at tables on the first floor."}
{"text":"I love that I can ride my bike to RnR. I also love that I have found a vegan item on the menu that I am perfectly content with. I ordered the apple and gorgonzola salad which is made with candied walnuts, apples, strawberries, gorgonzola cheese and prickly pear vinaigrette (I ordered sans the cheese). The dressing was amazing....I'd love to have some stocked in my refrigerator for daily consumption! We had great service at RnR and the atmosphere was awesome. There are other items that look vegan-friendly: veggie tacos, sweet potato fries, seasonal fruit bowl and the portobello mushroom sandwich (minus the aioli). I'll be back to try out more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Poor to mediocre over priced food.  Grilled cheese was dried out, burgers were dry and flavorless.  $84 plus tip for four meals and a kids meal plus two drinks.  I know it's Old Town, but go around the corner to Rehab.  We only went here because Rehab was full.  Big mistake."}
{"text":"Essentially a sports bar, but has a more upscale flair. The decor is nice, and has very open layout--so an get a bit noisy. So be aware if you planned on having dinner conversation.  But because of the open atmosphere, it is great for groups and people watching.   I actually love the breakfast here. It isn't as popular as some of the other spots on Scottsdale strip--so you can get seated and served rather quick.  Also, it is a quick jaunt from the local farmers market, so you can stroll around afterwards.    The food is really good, fresh and well presented. I order hot tea for breakfast frequently-- and usually I just get an old Lipton bag with Luke warm water.  This place gave me a nice tray with quality tea, lemon slices and piping hot water in nice mug. Their side of fruit is also very nice -- you get a cup of fresh berries instead of the standard old honeydew chunks.  Dinner is equally nice.  You have the standard sports bar options (burgers, fries, etc.), but presentation and quality is stepped up a notch."}
{"text":"Being from the bay, we loved this place! Giants fans only, great vibe & atmosphere... can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Greatest place in scottsdale. Food is ok for what it is but that's not why you come. Great environment and atmosphere. Bottomless mimosas and great drinks."}
{"text":"By far the worst breakfast experience that I have had in town. No follow up by staff and food took forever, with the order being wrong"}
{"text":"Wait, wait, WAIT! I have not reviewed this awesome spot in Scottsdale, AZ? Somebody check my pulse....PLEASE.  Who wants: - Bottomless Mimosas or Bloody Marys for 10.00?  I stuck with the Mimosas cause they just kept coming...  - Great selection of grub for brunch that is served till 2pm? I grubbed on Pulled pork Tacos, scrambled eggs, green chilies, pepper jack cheese and on the Buttermilk biscuits Spice sausage, roasted green chile gravy (I'm getting hungry)  - Great music? Eating, Dancing, Eating, Dancing...  One of my FAVORITES when in Scottsdale! They also have a great selection of wine!   I am sure in need of some R&R! When's the next flight... SFO-PHX"}
{"text":"I have been here a TON of times. And its for sure NOT the service that gets me to come back. If you sit at the bar, as with most places you will get better service. At a table, it ranges from crappy service to you wondering if your server was cut and took off for the night... However- their food is SO good.. Amazing salads, and fat kid food like the animal fries. They have a KILLER industry discount on Sundays and Mondays. If its not 150 degrees outside I would sit outside on the patio. Good people watching."}
{"text":"Enjoying yet another brunch at RnR. I finally learned to show up early enough to get whatever table I wanted. Kevin is rocking the upstairs patio and putting up with all the B.S. I can come up with. He's a rock star.  Food, always impressive. Bottomless mimosas? I think so. Atmosphere? On point. I haven't been here outside of brunch but I'm sure it's just as wonderful when it's slow. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is really good and the bottomless bloodies and mimosas on the weekends is one of the most fun things you can do in town. The patrons and the staff are always super hot, the vibe is young and fun, and the music is always great. This is not some place I'd take my parents, but personally that's is what I like about it. I give it 5 stars because I've never had a bad time here"}
{"text":"They charge a 3% CC processing fee without even telling you. Shady way of business. Never been to a restaurant that charges a fee for using a CC."}
{"text":"This was a fun atmosphere for a large group of girls, great location.  We were seated at an extra long table on the patio...liked that the table and chairs were pub height.  It was a Saturday nigh, so pretty crowded, not a lot of space to move around.  There was a DJ spinning some old school favorites (think Arrested Development - Mr. Wendal, Next - Too Close, etc.) and most everybody there was groovin' a little at one point or another.    After checking in on Yelp, I claimed an offer for a half-priced drink and went with the 4-beer sampler...every one of them was enjoyable.  Everyone's food smelled amazing, although I didn't eat anything myself.  We were celebrating a friend's birthday and they brought out a GIGANTIC Cinnabon with candles for her.  Plenty enough to share, that's for sure!    The inside bar area isn't very spacious, but like I said, the location is excellent for starting out the night in Old Town Scottsdale.  Have fun!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and fun atmosphere.   Yo Yo"}
{"text":"Services is terrible!  The bouncers and managers have attitudes!   Very rude to customers."}
{"text":"Best brunch in scottsdale. Bottomless mimosas, great food, plenty of tv's, and a DJ. You cant beat it. If you are looking for some late night eats, everything here is half off after $10."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for late night munchies. Came here a few nights ago for a friend's Bachelorette and our server Christian was amazing. A friend and I shared the ahi tacos and the hangover fries. Ahi tacos were different because they sit them on a jicama slice. The hangover fries are a must try! Fries topped with bacon, jalapeños, cheese and 2 fried eggs? Party in my mouth! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Impromptu stop for a late lunch - sat outside on the patio with the busy Scottsdale Road traffic and pedestrians to watch.  It's a good thing we had some entertainment because the food was a little slow considering there were only a few people there.  I had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich, which came with garlic aioli sauce, red pepper topping, and a pesto base.  it was very tasty, would order again.  I also ordered a filthy martini, which is billed as a dirty martini and blue cheese filled olives - with so much olive juice it's filthy!  Strong, but a slight disappointment as only one of three olives were actually filled with blue cheese."}
{"text":"I kinda think the employees hang out here for a little RnR with their paycheck.  Service was not terrible, but given the fact the dining room was relatively empty, it should have been better.  And while I appreciate the tasting menu (that would be the sauce no one bothered to wipe off), we went with just drinks and dirty chips.  My white sangria was just okay.  The\"dirty chips\" (house-made potato chips topped with wing sauce, ranch dressing, bleu cheese, and bacon) were also okay, but the chips themselves were overly browned for my taste and there was entirely too much wing sauce on that plate.  It made me want a piece of chicken to dip in there.   Not bad, but nothing left me wanting to rush back, although their breakfast menu is appealing."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Servers are absolutely wonderful and friendly. Food is pretty good too! Buuuut, it is TOO LOUD, too crowded and too filled with \"bros\". Forget about coming here durimg tourist season...on multiple ocassions my reservations have been lost or forgotten.  Trying to put your name on the waiting list is a joke. You will never be called or texted amd you will certainly never never see a table. Maybe I will see you next summer."}
{"text":"The music was good on a Friday night, DJ is great. Chicken lollipops are super salty if you order Hot. Also a $1.50 'tech processing fee'for using a credit card but it's not explained if you don't ask. Couldn't get any draft pitchers from our server, she pushed buckets on us instead saying there wasn't any drafts of bud light or Corona."}
{"text":"Old town Scottsdale. Parking medium but  depends on what time you arrive. Good music, pretty mixed crowd with mostly cool upper class people 21-40.   Nice bar with good tvs with sports on. Surprising wine selection and weak beer choices.  Really friendly bartenders and servers. Food selection was good and happy hour specials with drinks and gourmet bar food.  Definately good vibe and worth stopping in. Prices medium to mid high on normal menu. Will repeat."}
{"text":"My star rating might change, but so far, its pretty good. Nice vibe, beautiful girls sitting actoss from me, smokin hot bartender, and cute and friendly waitress.   The dj was spinning pop electronica, but its not overbearingly loud. I ordered dirty chips. Definitely not worth the ten bucks - they're just two bags of potato chips covered in sour cream and mild-medium buffalo wing sauce, with some bacon and feta. There wasn't enough bacon or feta to make it worth ten bucks though. Do not order them  My beer was a Kilt Lifter, which got a 21 ibu, so its not too bitter, and tastes pretty good. More to come as my meal progresses  Edit: I finished the dirty chips, but only because I wanted to get my moneys worth - not because it was worth the money, which it wasn't. Luckily the ranch dressing that came with my burger was there tondip my dirtless (lacking toppings) remaining chips.   The parmesan fries were bland. I couldn't taste the parmesan, they just seemed like regular fries to me, nothing special.  The saving grace Could be the burger, but we shall see if this thirteen dollar burger can turn around an almost thirty dollar meal"}
{"text":"Party up on the roof for a tasty brunch and bottomless mimosas on Sunday Funday! Bumpin music with quick service is just what you need on sunday fundays, which is what we got at RNR Gastropub.   We celebrated our friend's birthday here so there was a huge group of us and with the nonstop mimosas and Bloody Maries, the group soon became quite a handful I'm sure. Needless to say, their service was excellent and drinks were amazing.   I got a Mango Margarita which was very refreshing. To complement the drink, we ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos, which took refreshing to another level. They wrap the tuna with radish wraps, which was very light and healthy. Nachos, Fries, and the breakfast burrito was all good."}
{"text":"Aweful! Dreadful food and bad customer service. Bartender is unfriendly and obviously hates his life. No smile, no hello, no thank you. Asked if something is good and he was like, yeah it's great, with an attitude like just order already I have no recommendations and no clue about the food nor do I care about it or you for that matter. Lol. Seriously. But, Props for a decent drink at least, that he did well. That's why 2 stars.  And to title yourself as a gastro pub is just wrong. Please go elsewhere.  I won't come here again even if it was free."}
{"text":"I'm sticking with my three stars but I am starting to have more of a soft spot in my heart for RNR.Why? Because their food is consistent. It's not great but it's consistent and it's a nice option for an weekend breakfast or lunch that doesn't normally have a wait. The patios are fun to sit on and have some mimosas and I've like the egg white turkey scramble which is good but feels like a healthy option as well."}
{"text":"Used to love this spot and it was a go to for bringing out of town guests. Brought 6 of our friends from MA yesterday and it's gone way downhill. Got absurd attitude from the hostesses, waitress was ok but service was way slower than in the past. Got jalapeño Mac and cheese and it was blatantly the normal Mac, no apologies or offer to correct. Ordered something else, of course the Mac was still on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed even though it obviously only had one bite taken out of it. Portion was way smaller and quality has gone down. Very douche baggy vibe. Good place to go if you want to be treated like shit and get mediocre food and service. Were given our bill before we asked for it and told we could still get mimosa refills but then stopped getting refills. Had to go up to the bar. Waitress gave herself double gratuity on the bill so make sure you check your bill if you're going with a large group and gratuity is included. Bottomless mimosa deal is great but with all the other options around, will be skipping this place in the future."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here on a Saturday for a little food. There was 3 of us and we ordered the mimosas and something to eat. I had the mac & cheese, my gf had the pretzel bites and my boyfriend had the quesadilla. Everything was great! The mac & cheese was awesome and I still think about it!   We will certainly be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The waiter asked me what I wanted.   I told him the Southwest Burger.  But he knew me better.  He knew I actually wanted the Southwest Charcoal Burger.  He asked if how I would like it cooked.  I said medium.  But he knew that I actually meant throw the burger away and put a piece of charcoal between the buns.  Every bite I took it reminded me of my grandfather's stories of mining for coal.  I recommend RnR to everyone who appreciates the struggle."}
{"text":"What happens when 7 Mexicans go into RnR in Scottsdale? Nothing! NO SERVICE! We were told there would be a 45 minute wait for a table but we didn't see anyone waiting for tables. They send us upstairs and we ask if the tables are open seating, the waitress says yes, so we all go up there only for her to say \"the bar seats are the only things open up here\" like you just told us the tables were open seating WTH? so we go back downsides, there were not 7 seats open.  This place is unorganized, the hostess has no clue about how to do her job.  we lef!  We can spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in mid afternoon and it was not crowded yet. There was no loud music or DJ that some people complain about when we were there. Great place to watch sports. This place is nice and open. We sat at the bar and it was quite comfortable with plenty of TVs. We had Goose Island 316 draft beer that was very good. We also had nachos (added ground beef). They were very very good. The bartender was super nice and would definitely return if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"3 stars due to the view of Scottsdale road. Other than that there's nothing special about this place. Good looking Scottsdale girls come there for mermosa's on Sunday but that's the only appeal.  Oh an the food...it's bland and nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Saturday Fun Day! I had an amazing bottomless mimosa brunch here with my friends and had the breakfast tacos- so yummy and the home fries were great. Our server was fabulous and kept coming around until 3 mimosa refills- what a saint! I love RnR- on the weekends it has a clublike feel for brunch."}
{"text":"cinco de mayo at RnR....what were we expecting? it was packed with a capital P! just when i think i've worked out enough, 50 dudes are inside wearing tank tops with gigantic biceps. and the women? damn ass cheeks hanging out everywhere!  at the bar, a good 10 minutes to get drinks, meanwhile every hot chic who saunters up to the bar gets a drink right away....nothing new, but i'm getting too old for this scottsdale shenanigans.   we had 1 drink each and left. loud.....can you hear me? the place is LOUD!"}
{"text":"Not a bad casual spot in downtown Scottsdale.  They have a good patio set up and a really convenient location.  The service was good and so were the drinks.  We didn't have food but probably will next time.   We were able to easily get a table for 4 at 5:30 on a Saturday which was a nice surprise.  I'd go back for sure.  Be warned:  Even at 5:30 pm the music was \"College Bar\" loud.  That was the only major negative for an old guy like me."}
{"text":"I will never go back to RnR. Everyone seems to have a good time, but I experienced the most traumatic, rude customer service situation that I have ever dealt with in my entire life. I get to the bar and planned on having brunch with my family of 6. We put our name on the list around 10:30, and never got a seat. Why waiting, we were forced to stand. Since it was warm in the building, my husband collapsed and had a seizure out of nowhere! I panicked immediately and screamed for someone to call 911. My husband is 6'1, 180 lbs. I am only 5'3', 123 lbs. Therefore, me trying to help him up and walk out of the bar was nearly impossible. Realizing this, I yelled frighteningly for one of the taller, bigger male employees to please help me stand up and walk my husband out of the building. Instead of rushing to help, they stood there and watched me struggle by myself. I asked them to get him water, I asked them for anything they could do as I was in such a fright, and they all watched nonchalantly as if we didn't matter. I was in such disbelief that these 3 white males watched this tiny black woman attempt to carry her muscular 180lb husband all alone with no sense of urgency. It was disgusting. I hated that. I hated them. Rude, inconsiderate, ridiculous behavior. How could you call yourself a man? If you want generous, caring service, refrain from RNR. Not to mention, show up at 7am or you'll never get a table."}
{"text":"JJ is an amazing bartender and the only reason I gave the venue two stars. The hostess and bartenders can take a lesson from her on a thing or two. There was another gentleman at the downstairs bar that was outside that was amazing. He and JJ deserve a raise or a promotion. For management if you care about your business I do believe there must be a better way to deal with seating at this venue. From my perspective the entire checking in process was pointless. I was one of many who sat at an open table because of how poorly the hostess were doing regarding seating. Even when I let the hostess know I had found a seat at the bar she didn't remove my name from the list which goes to show the seating process that RnR has is extremely flawed."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD. How I never found this place until a couple weekends ago baffles me, since I'm always in Scottsdale on Sundays for none other than Sunday Funday... needless to say, Sunday Funday will never again be complete without this snazzy joint.   The cure to a hangover is to drink some more (yessssss) so get your lazy ass outta bed and COME HERE! For $16, you can get ALL the bloody marys and mimosas you want. Yes, you read that right.  Not that I heard anything else from the gorgeous bartender after that $16 deal, but the recommendations for food came out PERFECT. I added a picture of how it turned out (don't mind my still-very-drunk-face) so prepare to droooooooool.   There's also a DJ outside, two floors, lots and lots of beautiful people... and smiley faces everywhere (probably because everyone's trashed). See you Sundayyyyy! :D"}
{"text":"Fun place, good happy hour, I didnt even know the wine is all half price but the bar food is kind of crappy and stomach achey type stuff. I had fried buffalo sliders and others had those cowboy french fries piled up with junk, wine was excellent though, I had the chilean ones and the spain ones. our bill was pretty cheap being all half off on HH. So 5 stars for that! Super atrractive bar staff also. Easy on the eyes."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I'm from Tucson and went up to visit some friends last Saturday. That being said, I was blown away by how great the service and atmosphere of RnR was Sunday morning. We sat outside on the patio at ground level and it was just what I needed after a late night bar-hopping. The breakfast sandwich and scone were delicious! Favorite part though was the DJ; her playlist was phenomenal! Definitely going back every time I visit! I wish there was a place like this in Tucson!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here seemed bumping when we walked by on Saturday late morning. They also boasted about having the best bloody Mary's- so obviously we stopped in! Sat at the bar, the bartender was very non-engaging and we were two of 3 people initially at the bar!!! The bloody's were very sub-par. Burnt bacon garnish, only the leafy stems of the celery stick(not edible).. And they were lacking flavor, we were very disappointed!!  Won't be in a rush to make it back to this place.... Ever! The bartender needs to seriously step up his game he sucked!"}
{"text":"Our server xavier is always really friendly and has a great recomendation for us whenever we needed one! He's always quick and friendly and the food is amazing especially if you come after 10 p.m. when everything on the menu is half off even dessert and margaritas! If it's your first time to get a burger or the animal fries appetizer."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to catch the game. It's got indoor and patio seating, as well as an upstairs. There's tons of TVs playing just about everything. The place had a good energy pumping thru, even though it was 110 degrees outside. It was busy when we came in on a Friday afternoon, but we were able to find seats at the bar. The bartenders are really nice, and constantly made their way around the bar to make sure everyone was \"hydrated.\"  We dropped in for a quick bite before picking up a friend at the airport for dinner, so we just ordered apps: pulled pork sliders, buffalo chicken lollipops, hangover fries, and a few beer cocktails. Let me just say that the BBQ sauce for the sliders alone made my day. It's got such deep flavors with a little sweet and smokey kick. What knocked it out of the park for me was the texture. It was almost like a chutney. Man did I want to just spread that on anything I could get my hands on. Alright, back to reality. It was the first time I had chicken lollipops, and I have to say I probably prefer them over wings. It's the perfect tender chunk of chicken atop a bone. It was so easy to eat. I bet it took no longer than 30 seconds for us to finish the entire dish. The hangover fries? Well the name says it all. I lathered on a little BBQ sauce, and well, you know how that went. The beer cocktails was the perfect drink to wash everything down, refreshing and light, yet still had great depth and flavor. RNR is definitely one of my go-to spots when I visit AZ."}
{"text":"Subpar service which resulted in an ordered item that was never delivered. Breakfast food was good, with the potential to be great. The breakfast sandwich was a bit on the greasy side and breakfast potatoes served just barely warm. Would give them another shot for happy hour and what looked to be an inventive evening menu."}
{"text":"Such a great place, celebrating my friends bday! Really recommend this place! The atmosphere is good, Love Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool place the music is a little loud everywhere you go in this place, there is three bars and 2 patio's each with there own bar one upstairs and one down (patio's) the drinks are expensive here but the staff is good and they want to get you drunk here. Our server was all over us pushing the drinks! She did a great job. Not sure I would want to come back to this place it's way to loud here!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick dinner and really liked that it's doggo friendly. The servers were nice to my family, myself, and my pup. Also, the brussel sprouts are banging. Everything else was good, the burger I got came with a garlic aioli and was tasty!"}
{"text":"Eh. This place has a great bar atmosphere and is a fun place to catch a football game. However, the food is lackluster. Given their prices, I would expect much larger portions for the jalapeno lollipops and the fish taco."}
{"text":"Food and service was great, however, the techno music really took away from a four star review.  Don't get me wrong, that kind of music has a place at the dance clubs, but not while I am trying to enjoy the game, and the company of my friends."}
{"text":"This place is fun.  It's always packed when I go. The chicken lollipops are awesome and so is the grilled cheese sandwich. The articoke dip is NASTY though.  Tastes like canned soup. Bleh!  I met a girlfriend up there for happy hour and you can't beat the prices, especially for Scottsdale. The staff is always super friendly and goes out of their way to make you feel like you are an important customer even with a full house.  I love sitting on the upstairs patio during this time of year. The only thing I hate is the hassle of finding a decent parking spot."}
{"text":"I came here with for brunch on New Year's Day with a dozen people, and the place was packed.  The music was pretty loud, so you have to shout to your friends if you want them to hear you.  It was amusing to see that some customers looked like they were still wearing their NYE outfits with their stilettos, shiny dresses, and suits.  I love people watching in Old Town!  Anyways, although our group had a reservation, we still had to wait 30-45 minutes until we were actually seated.  But I definitely didn't mind, because the crowd was fun, and bottomless mimosas are $15.  Apologetic for the wait, the restaurant manager came over to our table on the patio and gave our table free appetizers and tickets to a nearby club.  Score!   I ordered the Egg White Turkey Scramble that included apple turkey sausage, roasted red peppers, spinach and scrambled eggs, home fries, and toast.  Prices are on the mid to high side, but don't forget that this is Scottsdale.  My dish was light, flavorful, and was perfect alongside my mimosa.  For appetizers, our table enjoyed the Jalapeno Mac n'Cheese that consisted of cavatappi pasta tossed in a spicy jalapeno cheese sauce and topped with parmesan bread crumbs---it was scrumptious.  We also enjoyed he Hangover Fries, which were parmesan fries loaded with cheddar cheese, jalapenos, tomatoes and bacon topped with two eggs sunnyside up with sour cream.  Wow---I had never had eggs on top of my fries before, and the name \"Hangover Fries\" is perfect.  Our table scarfed these down, and some people claimed that their hangovers were already subsiding!  I was impressed with the staff, because they were on their A-Game.  They didn't forget anything when we asked, and were just great.  I definitely plan on coming back, because RnR rules!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ate here for breakfast last time we were in phoenix and had to come back this year! You get to watch the world go by, while you sip on a yummy Bloody Mary and nom on your BYO omelette (which is the best omelette I've had in phoenix). Great breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"It is a nice place to hang-out, it had that sports bar feel to it.  My friend pick this place out, but really I enjoyed catching up with her more and cared less about the food.  With that said, I did not like the food.  The plus side, our waiter was super nice and the ambiance is something my age group would appreciate."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch with a friend of mine and sat outside on their second story.  The service was prompt and polite and the food was Delicious!   I had the Chicken Sandwich and my friend had the RnR Burger (we split everything down the middle).  The sandwich was so tasty-with the brie and the sun dried tomatoes...It had so much flavor, i loved it.  and the Burger was just as good-The bacon was done perfectly and the bun gave it a great taste.  We each got different fries (parmesan and sweet potato) but the sweet potato were some of my favorite i've ever had. I would recommend this place fore sure. I just wish it was a bit more homey-i like places that make you feel like your part of their working family or  joke around with you and such, might of been the day i went but besides that-it was great."}
{"text":"The South West Chicken Salad is great. I'm never crazy about paying $14/$15 for a salad, but you know I really enjoyed it so no problem....but paying $20 for delivery in Old Town?  That's highway robbery."}
{"text":"Visiting a good friend and he always talks about this place. I finally went with good friends and had the best time. Kevin was the best server because he was on it refilling our mimosas. He also took out orders and was responsive. The supervisor was amazing too. Love this place and I plan to come back when visiting Arizona."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Eddie Money - Take Me Home Tonight)  Take me to the RnR tonight I don't want to let you go till I have a bite Take me to the RnR tonight Listen honey, just like Ronnie sang, \"I'm a little tipsy...oh oh oh\" I get a bruschetta plate with a glass of wine I get a hangover (fries) I hate to eat alone I need some company, so I called my friends To keep me warm when the cold winds blow (out in the patio!) I can hear your belly I say we start to order! Take me to the RnR tonight   The RnR is the only bar with an upper deck on Scottsdale Road; point is you can't miss it!  Parking can be a headache here so I would definitely recommend finding a spot in one of the lots on the East end.    The RnR is a pretty hip place.  It has that industrial feel since everything reminds me of a steel factory inside, minus the sparks and welding mask!  They generally have live music or DJ on site, which is pretty cool.    Nightly food and drink specials!  I came on a Tuesday night so it was purchase a plate of bruschetta and your bottle of wine cost $15.  Not a bad deal I guess, but I hate to just stick to wine all night.  RnR is so far the only place I notice with Beer cocktails; if you don't know look it up. Supposedly, this is a hot new thing to do.  Beer with a mix of liquor.  I myself so far am not a fan since I like my beer ... beer and my cocktails ... well you get the point.  However, I would recommend you try and let your palates do the judging.    Along with the bruschetta, we ordered some Hangover Fries, Brussel Sprouts, Ahi Tacos, and finally a burger.  We didn't think the Hangover Fries was that great, but we've had the Animal Fries before and they were much better so I would stick with that.  The Brussel Sprouts I would have them fried with the bacon; has more taste that way.  The Ahi Tacos were the highlight of the nights.  Nicely seared tuna on a jicama tortilla!  YUMMY!  I think I could eat 50 of these and be satisfied!  The burger itself was okay at best.  However, this place is definitely a burger joint since half the menu was burgers or sandwiches.    Overall, a cool experience and a hip place to hangout.  I think the live music is cool and the service was good!  If you need a place to hang, well you found one! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"**BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS, FRAT BOYS, AND BRUNCH**  Good energy.  Loud music.  Hot messes everywhere.  We sat outside in the front.  Good looking staff and plenty of bottomless mimosas.  Ordered shots for $9 a pop (Patron and Grey Goose).  A mix of friendly locals, Frat boys, and Spring Training attendees.  We had a good time despite the funny looks and stares by neighboring tables because of our crazy dancing.  Haters are going to hate.  Players are going to play.  RECOMMEND for those seeking bottomless mimosas, Blood Mary's, and a Frat Boy to take home."}
{"text":"Verdict: RnR is completely accurate for this place... right up until about lunch time.   After late morning, you won't be doing any resting, relaxing, recuperating, etc. here. I guess what I'm saying is the place gets packed and they really crank the music. Maybe the Rs stand for rock & recreation but on to the gastro and pub. That's why we're all here, right?  I'd certainly recommend the burrito. I'd also recommend every breakfast food I saw coming out of the kitchen. Everything looked great and my friends confirmed it tasted just as good. If you're looking to start drinking early, there's a nice deal on unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. You also get a breakfast entre because they don't want you only having tons of alcohol without any food in your system. More on that later.  While my friends loaded up on their unlimited mimosas and bloody marys, I went for the BYO breakfast burrito. Being a good NM boy, I had to go with the green chile pulled pork. Also got the bacon, potato, onion, and brie. The only thing I'd change was the cheese. Brie is excellent but the flavor couldn't come through with all the other ingredients. There were plenty of potatoes with onions and peppers on the side.  You might find that some patrons go overboard with the unlimited early morning drinks. There were at least two people who got sick in the bathroom during our visit to the gastropub. They made quite the mess but the bathroom attendant cleaned everything up quickly. I was wondering why they had an attendant and I guess that answered the question."}
{"text":"This place was freaking amazing. Was recommended by a friend to try this place out so me and the fiancé stopped by for brunch on our last day in Arizona. Right away we were seated, we asked to sit near the open area as it was a nice day out with a little breeze and waitress was kind to put on the heater above for us. (Sorry forgot her name but she was a blonde who told us she just moved from upstate AZ) she was awesome! Had the best Bloody Mary EVER. The bacon was so crispy and just one of these gave me a good buzz. I ordered this pulled pork with potatoes and this egg on top. It was delicious and so moist full of flavor. We also tried the Brussels sprouts (omg more bacon! Delicious), and couldn't leave without trying the hangover fries ... Wow!! You get a bang for your buck here!! Must check this place out I can only imagine how much fun it is at night. If I ever come back to AZ I'll definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Checked in with Yelp and say this promotion and ordered it. The waitress said she's never seen it and walked off with my phone without asking. When she returned, she informed me that the bartender said \"we're not doing that.\" She had no explanation as to why it's a current promotion on Yelp and walked away. Such a disappointing customer service experience."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE. THIS PLACE IS INFESTED WITH COCKROACHES.   Disgusting.   This place sure has gone down hill. Manager Dakotah is rude and passive aggressive. Used to love it here but won't be coming back. Please get your General Manager some training on how to be a good manager and a decent human being."}
{"text":"This is an attractive place.  The two level building is very open and nicely designed with exposed concrete and steel construction.  A couple of patios with misters overlooking Scottsdale Rd are a nice touch when the weather isn't too hot.  I sat at the bar for happy hour and enjoyed a couple of Fat Tires.  I tried their popcorn rock shrimp which was pretty good.  At happy hour prices, this was an enjoyable place to relax for an hour or so."}
{"text":"Not a terrible spot to pregame and start your night. Bar food was ok. Beer selection was ok."}
{"text":"Went to have a nice breakfast service was so slow and when food came a big bite out of my toast!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to review RnR after the first time I went there for happy hour.  The setup was awesome as I found myself perfectly situated on the patio between two flat screen tvs watching the playoffs.  I was impressed with the layout and comfort level of the patio, along with a great looking menu and decent mix of patrons.  They do a good job with some minor details (like the gum tabs in the table settings), however now that I've been there 4-5 times, I've come to realize their weakness lies in service.  The last three times I've been there, we've had as many problems with our service.  For one, our food came out without any silverware.  The runner didn't notice and also only brought out two of the three items ordered.  We were not asked if we needed any ketchup for our fries either.    On a separate occasion, we stopped in for a few drinks around 9pm.  I was dragging ass from a long day at work and decided to order a Redbull/Vodka.  Rockstar was poured & sold to us without even asking.  I'm no trademark attorney, but I don't think Redbull would be too happy to hear that patrons are unknowingly being served a substitute energy drink (one of Redbull's largest competitors) without providing a heads-up.  Many would also consider this consumer fraud.  Although I let it slide after noticing the staff's uniforms are proudly showcasing the Rockstar logo.   This last time, I was there for brunch on Saturday.  My buddy wanted to eat somewhere with a great tv setup.  So I took him to RnR talking up the patio setup.  We sat on the patio to enjoy the plethora of sporting events that were on:  Playoff hockey, NBA playoffs, PGA tourney, NFL draft, etc.  Once we were sat, both tvs on the patio were showing Penn State freshman football scrimmage...in April!  I politely asked our server if he could have it changed to one of the aforementioned events.  The server just looked at me with a blank look and gave us no response.  After 15 minutes of Nittany Lion practice, I went to chat to the bar tender.  The bar tender immediately came outside and worked it out.  Apparently, our server just dismissed our request.    When our food came out, my meal was incorrect.  A completely different dish than what I ordered.  Luckily, the MOD came over and asked how we were doing.  Right then our server came over.  When he figured out that my meal was wrong, all he did was shrug his shoulders.  I don't think he has much serving experience.  The manager, Kathleen, was the one who took my plate and assured me they'd get it right.    Not only did she correct my order, but she comped that item for us.  Her approach, solution, and sincerity was enough to bring me back again.  Not to mention, she's a fox.  Thank you K.C.  I will return to give RnR another shot.  FYI...I read some other reviews and many people commented on the noise from the bikes across the street.  Most of the comments happened to be during Arizona Bike Week, which was the third week of April.  I don't see that being an ongoing concern.  There are always bikes up and down Scottsdale Rd, but I would give RnR a little consideration on that.    Overall, food is okay.  I've had some good plates and not-so-good plates.  I ordered the baby back ribs once.  I was told it was a full slab of ribs, but indeed was only a half slab.  They were tasty, but I split the entree with someone because we were told it was a full slab.  So we both left there a little hungry.    I'm giving three stars because it's a cool spot, great location, good atmosphere and they do a lot of things right.  However, they're still somewhat new and have plenty of room to step up the service.  In order to compete in this part of town, I'm fairly confident that they'll improve on their weakness."}
{"text":"RNR! Thank you so much for making sure my birthday happy hour went off without a hitch. To making sure I had reserved tables, to separate checks, to EVERYTHING! I am so very appreciative of the entire staff and everything you did to make sure it was seamless. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!"}
{"text":"This place seems managed and operated by high school students. Waitress ? what's that? Maybe saw her twice. The food was great the hospitality is a joke. I guess that what you should expect from a 3.5 star."}
{"text":"They have a huge sign on the wall that says $8 you-call-its but when we got our bill the drinks were $12 each. Seems like a small difference but for 8 drinks for our group that's  a $32 difference!!! When we asked our server about it she was just like \"oh sorry, we should probably take that sign down since we don't offer that anymore.\" What the hell!?! Easy excuse to NEVER come back and make sure no one we know will, either"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a delish restaurant in old town look elsewhere. If you're looking for a place with overly priced bar food, bad ambience, and decent service, welcome to RnR! We have come here for game days and drinks which are pretty lively, but extremely loud. It is a good bar, but the food is sub par.   We most recently came on a Wednesday night. Made it in time for happy hour which entails 1/2 off all wine, beers, wells (i believe) and a select few small bites.  We ordered the animal fries and ate what seemed like day old fries smothered...and i mean smothered w BBQ sauce. The fries were rock hard. Not very enjoyable but we were starving. The salad we ordered was covered in way too much dressing and the grilled cheese wasn't even melted. I don't think ill be coming back, unless it is solely for drinks at happy hour."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I decided to have brunch here and we really did enjoy everything about RnR! I thought it was a bit loud but it was all apart of the atmosphere! Once we got settled everything was perfect!   The waitstaff was amazing! Xavier never let us see the bottom of our mimosa glasses! Service was great and the food was awesome. I am sure we will be attending another fabulous Sunday and we will be requesting to have Xavier as our server!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh,  was recommended by a friend.  Good service but was underwhelmed by the menu,  pricing and the eventual meal.  Had the Ahi Tacos which were tiny,  in their defense they warned me so my expectations were low.  The streamed Brussel Sprouts were undercooked and hard.  With all the good options I would stay away from here."}
{"text":"Had a groupon voucher for the mint but they quit serving dinner so said it would be valid at RnR.  Decided to give it a go this past Sunday with my boyfriend and my son for lunch/brunch.   Huge error in judgment.  If you love loud music where you can't hear yrself speak and love crowds go there on a Sunday.  My only hope is that I will be able to go during the week for a 'quieter' lunch to use this groupon.  My take on this place without having eaten there - catering to the 21-30 crowd and probably not interested in being a serious restaurant (where people actually choose to go eat not just to people watch).  Looking for a good place to eat with solid service, nice atmosphere and good food - Italian grotto, 2 blocks north on scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you don't get the \"Veggie Tacos (what the heck are these?!)\" or the Queso Dip, you'll be fine... probably. I do love the $15 bottomless Mimosas! I'll be back... not going to lie."}
{"text":"Been going here for the past 3 years and usually there is no seats and ask someone if we can sit with someone?  After I asked politely and a gentleman said no problem and introduced himself.  I said are you sure it's ok and he said yes.  Evidentially his girl friends brother was the General Manager / bouncer and she advised me that was her brother.  Sat there for 10 minuites and then he came by and I said can't order a beer he said no you can't sit at that table?  Hmm.  Then his fellow bouncer came over and evidentially though I was gonna need to be removed from the bar and was laughing.  I proceed to leave and there two more bouncers at the door laughing at me?  Hmm. I called the business card on the counter of the head chef and explained what happened never before?  He said that Tall blonde bouncer was the General Manager.  I asked do you think the owner would want to know of this poor service and he proceeded to say.  The owner owns almost all of down town south scottsdale?  Not quiet sure what that means.  We then went to the Vig great food service and no rude bouncers also acting as a General Manager.  They must really need 3 bouncers because the owner has so much money that he trains his General Manager to not give a crap about patrons.  And or laugh and possibly get visitors upset.  Stay tuned this manager is gonna show up again causing problems again.  Usually spend 95.00 for lunch here too?"}
{"text":"Pefect patio happy hour spot! My gorgeous server Erika was excellent and attentive. She recommended a half Guinness, half Lagunitas IPA that was superb! Totally hit the spot with my Pretzel Bites and Veggie Tacos. My friend ordered the flatbread that's off menu as a special. Delicious, they need to add that thing to the menu. Plenty of TV's, I was there to watch the AL Wild Card Playoff. The GM, Cassie, even stopped by to make sure our table was enjoying our stay. Super classy touch. Another server, Garrett, even suggested we all try Irish Mules, a Moscow Mule with Jameson instead of Russian Vodka. Right up our table's alley. Now to get back to the game before they notice I'm reviewing them :)"}
{"text":"So if you want to be treated like legit trash this is your place !!!! Yes this place is \"poppin\" but unless you are Britney Spears you'll never get a table on Sunday if you put your name in they'll never call you. You'll see many people who came after you seated before you. The servers will push you out of the way instead of saying excuse me. Because serving mimosas and bloodies to drunk people is so stressful and hectic people need to move asap !!!! Anyway there are other places in Scottsdale that will treat you like human."}
{"text":"Burgers are so delicious! The bacon is so thick, fries are so crispy. Service was probably the only downfall. Didn't seem like our waitress and bartender wanted to be there."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Definitely worth visiting to grab a drink or two and some great food. Best food I've had in a long time and at a fair price."}
{"text":"I love this place. I brought my 200lb English mastiff here and he was more than welcome.  Our waitress Erica was amazing and even got a water dish for Baby (mastiff). Definitely my favourite local restaurant."}
{"text":"We went for Happy Hour last week so I can only comment on the drinks. I rarely drink liquor but the Spa caught my eye so I gave it a shot. Order it! So delicious!  Need to come back for breakfast - the menu looks awesome."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND   Ok, l just love RnR Gastropub.  But first, what is a \"gastropub\"?  The term \"gastropub\" was first coined in 1991 by two London bar owners (David Eyre and Mike Belben).   British Pubs were historically places to hangout and just have drinks, with little to no emphasis on food. It wasn't until more recently that they started to serve food at all, and now have progressively added menus with a larger selection of food.   In 2012, the term \"gastropub\" was officially added to to the dictionary.   RnR: THE HISTORY   So, back to RnR...  RnR opened in 2010 by Evening Entertainment Group. Their 8 venues (Bevvy Gastropub, Bottled Blonde, Hi Fi Kitchen, The Mint Ultra Lounge, Livewire Entertainment Venue, Maya, RnR Gastropub and Sandbar Mexican Grill), are all known for their distinct architecture, dramatic lighting and a great menu.  THE STORY   I first found RnR last year when a few of us tried to have a late dinner and drinks in Old Town and most everything was closed. Someone suggested we try RnR and I instantly loved it.  RnR has everything I like in a bar:  Decor  RnR is a two story, indoor/outdoor, modern industrial architecture with crazy hype lighting and multiple spaces to hangout in, depending on what you're looking for.   There is the dramatic central bar, high tables all around, patio seating and an upstairs that overlooks Scottsdale Road, that has a private bar, that is perfect for private parties.  Drinks  RnR has a full bar, so you can get any cocktail, as well as choose one of their specialty cocktails.  There is an 1,800 bottle wine cellar, serving by the glass or bottle.  Brunch often features the bottomless mimosa.  And there are even delicious imported coffees.  Menu  RnR serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Their motto is: \"Modern American classics with a modern twist.\"  They serve all the breakfast standards, appetizers, salads, burgers, tacos, sandwiches and desserts.  My favorite are the pulled pork sliders.  SERVICE EXPERIENCE   There are always a couple bartenders and servers throughout the dinning room, so there is rarely a wait to get served.  AMBIANCE   The atmosphere is super laid back, so coming in alone, with a couple friends, or dressed up on date are all acceptable.   CONCLUSION   5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE   *There is often live music on the patio which has always been super fun.   *Hours  Mon - Fri: 11am - 12am Sat/Sun: 11am - 2am  *They are available for private or corporate parties, and custom catering.  *My only issue is with the parking, which can be pretty hectic, but that's an Old Town Scottsdale issue, not a RnR issue.  *For more information: http://www.rnrscottsdale.com"}
{"text":"The food is good and the bloody marys aren't shabby. Be warned, they come with a slice of bacon in them though. However, this place is great for brunch on Sundays because they have bottomless bloody marys and mimosas. Just be prepared to wait quite a while for a table as they fill up fast here on the weekends.  Also, not really a family establishment. Last time I was here, a girl got so drunk by 11 am that she started dancing on the bar."}
{"text":"If you're in Scottsdale, make it your business to eat here ~ that is, if you can get in.  Their breakfast is amazing.  From the fresh squeezed juice to the multigrain pancakes.  Everything we ordered was fresh and excellent.  The waitstaff is very nice and helpful too ~ they're all smiling and in a great mood.  You really feel happy to be here.  A great date or hang out spot.  A must do!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch. It was busy but wasn't packed. The breakfast menu was very limited, but the breakfast tacos were amazing!  The service was very slow, and the endless mimosa prices seemed high. For the price the mimosas were watered down, and lukewarm. If I'm paying $24 for mimosas, I expect them to be cold and refreshing."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today for brunch. We sat on the patio at one of the lounge tables with the couches. Those made for a very relaxing atmosphere. I ordered the BYO omelette. I thought it was a steal for $10 because it came with potatoes and toast. The omelette and potatoes were good, but the toast was extremely stale. Service was a little disappointing. Everyone at the table finished their water before we got our food and the server never refilled them or ever came back after our food came so we could ask. I would return hoping for better toast and service."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place because it looks like a cool spot from the outside. It was a Sunday night - Labor Day weekend when we stopped in. Visiting from out of state, we had been up early and spent the entire day in Sedona, so when we got back in town we wanted a more low-key place to get drinks and some food. Searching online we saw that this place specifically boasted that it had \"50% off late night eats after 11pm\" on Sunday nights. Perfect.   We arrive and it is dead. Ok, it is on the outskirts of the party scene going on further downtown, so maybe that should've been expected. The hostess awkwardly asks if we'll be drinking tonight. We sit outside, they have the music bumping pretty loud, and the couches and oversized chairs are actually pretty comfy... oh, and then there's that sloppy wasted girl sitting one lounge area away from you giving her boyfriend a lap dance and dancing around their table like a stripper. Really?   Anyways, we order food (sliders and chicken \"lollipops\") and a couple drinks. The sloppy girl and her man eventually leave, and 45 minutes later our 2 small appetizers finally come out. It wasn't til about 30 minutes after we ordered that our waitress came up to apologize and say she was sorry the food was taking so long, but that right as we arrived they had actually closed down the kitchen, so when we and the table who arrived shortly after us ordered, they had to get everything in the kitchen back out. Seriously? I know it's not the waitresses fault, but why would you not mention that when we ordered. Also, why are you going to advertise your special on Sunday nights being \"late night eats starting at 11pm\" when apparently you decide to close your kitchen down at that same time? I understand when it's a slow night eventually someone has to make that call and say you're going to go ahead and close early... but if that's the case, mention it when we get there instead of making us feel awkward and like we're burdening you ask you clean up everything around us and basically shut the place down waiting for us to get finished eating. The food was ok, but the 45 minute wait spoiled it."}
{"text":"I'd like to touch on a few things. Went to RnR on a Saturday afternoon. The vibe was fun, energy was high, and the bartender was AMAZING! Used the Yelp check in offer, she let us know it was expired but still honored it and let us pick our beer selection. Great service!"}
{"text":"Came here after a Giants game on a Monday night like 10 PMish, and it was alive and well. Had no trouble getting a table a quick service. There was a group of guys partying it up big time at one table, so it was a pretty lively atmosphere. Real mix of folks, some older who had just gone to the game and some of the college age including a few not old enough to drink. Good beer selection decided not to do a margarita though they boast a good recipe. Had a Southwest Burger with sweet potato fries, that's a $14 burger. Pretty hardy meal and the fries were pretty tasty. Burger probably a little overpriced but was a good choice. Waitress was on the ball, would definitely make a return trip."}
{"text":"Went again for lunch today and it was good again. I ordered the same Bacon Brussels burger and it was actually better this time as they didn't over cook it. We sat outside and it was very nice!"}
{"text":"I would give it a solid 4 stars  Yes the service was slow but they seem unstaffed & it wasn't snottsdale  Everything we ordered was good The pulled pork sliders The animal fries  & the ahi tacos - totally disappointing looking & small but the best thing ever Yummy! & well priced for happy hour.    The drinks were decently poured ( better than saddle ranch) All in All a four"}
{"text":"Service was slow and horrible. Got the steak and eggs.  Steak was half fat. Waiters response was \"Oh!  We have a new supplier\". He didnt take it back and charged us any way. Eggs were cold. Stay away from this place for eating. Bar looked happening."}
{"text":"Big and Open, Tall and Long tables, lots of tv screens for sports people.  Seems like a great sports-type bar, and I like the idea of the $10 mega-mimosa weekends.They have a photo machine, which is fun, especially after a few cocktails.  The food was average, but I know a couple people that love their burgers. We shared some apps which were average.  they have 1/2 price wince by the bottle for happy hour, which was nice.  we also shared the Ahi Tacos, and those were \"meh\".  probablywould stick with the burgers n sandwiches if I were to return."}
{"text":"Came here for a Bachelorette party brunch and was very disappointed. The hostess was so rude to us  and gave us so much attitude, I could not believe that she was employed. We were not being difficult, demanding, or obnoxious so I was really confused why she was so rude to us. Our server, while friendly, was incredibly slow and seemed to ignore us. The table next to us got their drinks before we even ordered ours. It took over 20 minutes and two trips to ask if we could order for her to finally come around to take our drink order. This was a special occasion and so the fact that we couldn't even order drinks to celebrate was very frustrating.   The music is so LOUD that you can't hear anything. I understand that it's part of the atmosphere but I really didn't expect the music to be that loud. The food was good but that was about it"}
{"text":"RnR might be a Scottsdale thing to do or place to be at night, but when I met someone for lunch on a Monday, the place was almost empty.  I asked the waitress how many tacos I would get for $10 and she told me three. She also told me they would be hard shelled.  Two, already made, hardly filled soft tacos arrived with a small dish of guacamole and salsa. I find $10 for two small tacos extremely over-priced for lunch, especially since the waitress told me I would get three for that price. Another employee told me it's always two soft tacos and told me the waitress was new. Did he offer to give me another taco? No. For his lack of customer service after dissing the waitress, RnR gets a three star rating from the Costume Diva."}
{"text":"Thanks to Living Social, we found the place.  With all of the options for dining in Old Town, we wouldn't have found this place without the deal.  It's a nice bar/sports bar type feel with well appointed patio seating.  We sat outside all 4 times we came here because the weather was perfect.  Here's what we ordered:  Bottle of Santa Martina Red Blend, $26 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=nsNAAMUY7sNq9bOgScB93A#nsNAAMUY7sNq9bOgScB93A  RnR Sliders, $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=hXj4aoapioaosLF-qZXPkg#hXj4aoapioaosLF-qZXPkg  Bacon Brussels Burger, $15 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=c_cVWHczMxL8ESy1gLCkkw#c_cVWHczMxL8ESy1gLCkkw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=KowEFn_SZfJzcZK6Za1QWQ#KowEFn_SZfJzcZK6Za1QWQ  Southwest Burger, $13 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=5G_nZ1dHbeWQzBRE0CBclg#5G_nZ1dHbeWQzBRE0CBclg  Bleu Cheese Burger, $13  Animal Fries  Hangover Fries  Nachos, $10 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=hQTl2WZOQXTKtP_KjXoW2A#hQTl2WZOQXTKtP_KjXoW2A  The Burgers here are really good.  Out of all of them, my favorite was the Southwest Burger...very good and juicy.  The Nachos were above average.  They use a healthy dose of Queso Cheese and it's pretty good.  The Animal Fries is nothing like the In-n-Out version....it's a huge pile of BBQ Pork on top of the Fries....very good and can easily feed 3 people.  The Hangover Fries was very unique....a little Egg on top of Cheesy Fries...yum!  The food here was the highlight because the service here is not that good.  During all 4 visits we had issues with slow service.  During one visit, we were seated at our table and it took 15 minutes before anyone came over to get our drink order....we were very close to leaving.  Because it's not easy to park and get here, it would've been a hassle to leave and go somewhere else, so we stuck around.  If they can improve their service, they'll have a good chance to make this a special spot in my mind.  Some other random notes/tips:  - There's an ATM in the back near the Men's restroom if you need cash.  It's kind of an odd spot for it.  - Parking sucks, especially when there's a farmers market down there....they close off the parking structure in the back for the market so you're left to find street parking or park around the corner in one of the healthcare lots, which you're not supposed to do.  - There's plenty of TV's and this place is an awesome spot to watch sports.  - I really like the music they play here.  The nights we were there, they played upbeat house music....love it.  Overall, I'd rate this place 3.5 Stars but rounding up to 4 because I think it has so much potential.  If the service continues to suck, I'll have to drop it.  Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"\"WHAT?!\" \"I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\" This would be a great place to take someone you don't want to talk to/ have a hard time talking with."}
{"text":"Ok....we came on a Saturday afternoon from the Scottsdale Farmers Market.  We drive by RNR after the market each Saturday and decided to pop in.  I was excited to see they had a mimosa special that Saturday afternoon.  The hostess was very nice asked where we wanted to be seated as the inside was pretty full but it was pretty chilly outside and she could not find us seating for 4 with a heater that was working.  The upstairs was closed but we did see people seating up there.....so we waited.  She was ready to seat us and a foursome decided it was too cold outside and they took our seat inside.  The hostess told us to wait, but we left.    I couldn't wait to take my brother here as he is a chef in the Cape Cod area and read some of the Yelps reviews so I thought this would be a great place to lunch after the farmers market.  Anyhow, you don't let customers leave you make it happen especially when you have all of upstairs open.  This place will never know how much we spend here on lunch for 4 or the review it could of been."}
{"text":"Worst. Brunch. Experience. Ever.  EVER.  Hubs and I wanted to try a new brunch spot and boy were we surprised!  This place is LOUD. LOUD. LOUD. It was 1pm on a Saturday and there was a DJ. I've been to brunch w/ a DJ before, which is generally pleasant since a good DJ would understand that Rhianna on 11 is not appropriate for broad daylight. Maybe I sound like a grandma, but I felt so sick to my stomach from the thumping bass that my brunch didn't sit well.  The service was quick, although I had to literally SHOUT at our server. The food tasted good and came out really fast. These are the only reasons I will give away 2 stars.  The parties at adjacent tables were shouting so loudly and obnoxiously that I ate my eggs and potatoes at light speed to get out of there ASAP.  If you want a club atmosphere 24/7, come here. If not, stay far, far away."}
{"text":"Nothing like RNR sunday bottomless mimosas. I will always wait the time it takes to get in. They have a dj and staff that is on point. Love sitting on the patio on a nice day. Their protein pancakes are my favorite but I don't suggest getting the tacos. It is worth it going with the bottomless mimosas and a meal rather than just the bottomless mimosas special they have."}
{"text":"This place is so fun on Sunday's for brunch!  I was visiting Scottsdale and searched high and low for a trendy Sunday brunch restaurant that had good drink specials and fun music, and Yelp definitely took me there!  We got here on a Sunday around 12:30pm and it was a 40 minute wait.  That didn't bother us because we enjoyed bottomless mimosas ($15 a person with the purchase of an entree) outside on the patio while we waited.  The mimosas were really good and I almost had too many!    I ordered the \"build your omelet\" dish and my bf ordered the Breakfast Burrito.  The omelet was really dry, but maybe this is how the omelet's are made in AZ.  In Texas, we like them much more juicy, so that is my only issue with this place.  The burrito was really good and so were the potato (hash browns).    The music was great and the atmosphere was fun and perfect for a young crowd!  If I am in the area again, I will definitely come again for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas are cool. The patio is pretty sweet. The blonde hostess, maybe 5'8\" with rbf is so awful she made me wanna kill myself. She's so rude she needs help."}
{"text":"Drinks and nibbled last night. Wait staff were friendly and attentive. Food was good, We had ahi tuna mini tacos. Good selection of wine and beer. The wife is particularity about the wine, and they are running a half price wine special. For a casual night out it was great, would do it again if we get back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I had the Hangover fries with two sunny side up eggs, but came yolks hard. A specialty item like this for the price should pay attention to details."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here two of the days I was in Scottsdale.   Breakfast is amazing! The bartender, Dave, was so warm and welcoming and even brought me hot tea to help with my laryngitis.   Great atmosphere, very hip feel and amazing breakfast."}
{"text":"The place didn't quite match my definition of gastropub. But nothing's wrong with it as far as regular pubs go. We had our beers, which were good, checked the menu, and moved on."}
{"text":"My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife.   I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future."}
{"text":"We went here to watch football, friends had a reservation. Nice vibe...inside/outside seating. The sun is brutal on west side patio at sunset...they have shaded they'll lower if/when asked. The service was sub par. Young, lovely, nice gals, but not much serving experience.  It took so long to get a drink we were ordering 2 at a time  ordered pretzels and cheese dip. Dip was great!...pretzels were slices, comparable to puta chips...just softer. We had a nice time...service just iffy."}
{"text":"Had the RnR burger, which was great. Sweet potato fries was a change of pace. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Rude staff at this place.  My fiancé was kicked out because someone supposedly heard her throw up in the bathroom.  Even though she didn't throw up and they have no proof that she did."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, nice wine! The staff was very attentive and friendly! RnR is a great option for an afternoon lunch on a beautiful day!"}
{"text":"My overall assessment of RnR is of a typical overpriced Old Town party place with the attendant spotty service.  We wanted to plan a brunch for 10-12 people on a Sunday morning, so I called RnR a couple days before. The automated phone menu said to press \"2\" for a reservation, so I did. The girl who answered told me that they didn't take reservations, yet when I said that their recording said they did, she stated that was just for the evening. When I asked if she had any suggestions for a large party for brunch, she said to just \"show up.\" Ok, whatever. We showed up before they got too packed, and got a seat up on the upper balcony, which was actually very pretty. Not very mellow though, because a DJ was spinning tracks right below us, and the speakers were on full blast throughout the restaurant (which is fine, I think I'm just getting old and crotchety in my mid-20s).   The $15 bottomless mimosa/bloody mary with an entree is an ok deal, although whatever you do, do NOT order a single mimosa--it cost $8.50 for a measly little champagne flute of mimosa, which is ridiculous. The bottomless mimosa is a good deal only if your server and the busboys are on top of things, which ours weren't. We had to keep hounding them for refills, which makes trying to enjoy the bottomless deal really annoying. A place like Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers has a better mimosa deal, IMO--$10 for the first and $1 for each thereafter, and they're served in a big glass mug.   The food wasn't anything special (my grilled cheese was ok, and the pulled pork breakfast hash was rather dry), but the one standout was the fact that they serve brussels sprouts as a side--I had the bacon brussels sprouts, which were delicious--the one thing that would be 5 stars.   Our server was awful. My order came out the first time as a \"grilled chicken sandwich.\" He got me my original order rather quickly (after assuring me that my ticket would be moved to the front of the line--I kind of assumed it would be, but that's nice to know, I guess), and his apology included the comment that \"it happens all the time.\" As loud as it was, I can understand that occasional issues may happen like that (\"grilled ch---\" could go either way), but one would think that they would have figured out a solution, rather than that continuing to happen \"all the time.\" He also visited three of his tables (right next to us) on several occasions three to four times while studiously avoiding eye contact with us before coming to our table even once. Each time he finally came to our table, he would apologize because \"all his other tables are crazy,\" which just makes it seem like he can't do his job (and isn't incumbent on us to accommodate as similarly paying customers).   In short, RnR is definitely the place to be on a Sunday morning for those who want to keep the Saturday night party going. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, except to not expect this as the place to go for a conversation-laden brunch. If you are wanting to keep the party going, and don't care about how much it's going to cost to get drunk/the quality of the food once you get drunk, then it's totally worth it. Otherwise, you can find me in a laid-back bar with a good beer selection, muttering about \"kids these days.\""}
{"text":"Cool place. We just stopped in for some drinks to kill time before dinner. I'm sure the 200 plus reviews already summed it up so I'll just say it's worth stopping in at. The food looked great."}
{"text":"My maiden voyage to RnR started off shaky; my SO and I almost turned around when we first opened the door because there was an annoying DJ who was just loud as hell. Who thinks this is a good idea for Sunday morning, when all the poor, the downtrodden, and the hungover venture out for breakfast? I thought the club closed at 2 am last night.  Despite the dance remixes of Bon Jovi and too-cool-for-you crowd predominantly in their early 20s, Grandma and Grandpa decided to stay and indulge in some sundried tomato and goat cheese scrambled eggs, Chambord French toast, coffee, and Bloody Marys. I fully admit that the strip of bacon shoved in the Bloody Mary is totally surprising and off-putting for a vegetarian, but it is certainly creative. The Bloody was tasty, but slightly bland and nothing special. The scrambled eggs and hash browns (well done, natch) were huge and delicious, with plenty of tender sun dried tomatoes, but I had to save room for French Toast Mountain.   Good thing I did, and it's a damn good thing Fatty wore her stretchy jeggings, because I slurped my half of the French toast down and practically licked the plate clean. It was, bar none, the best French toast I have EVER had. Stuffed with sweet cream cheese, drenched in boozy raspberry sauce, and crowned with great fluffy piles of fresh whipped cream, it was a flavorful little orgasm on a plate.   Despite the remix of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" (poor Kurt is SPINNING in his grave) and slightly questionable service (forgotten English muffin), we will be back -- but only on a day when we have nothing else to do but lay around the house, buzzed and in a lethal food coma.... just YUM."}
{"text":"RnR went from my all time favorite Sunday-Funday brunch location to the WORST place ever! Just like every weekend....I attended RnR to meet with a group of friends expecting a great time, however on \"Sunday, October 23, 2016\" those plans went south.   As soon as I got to the front door, my ID was verified for the drinking age, but I was immediately DENIED entry due to my shoes being \"high tops\". I wear the same brand of shoes with the majority of them being high tops, and have never had an issue, even at this location.   Here's the kicker...I had another guy friend(Caucasian), with the SAME style of shoes, just different color...walk up 5mins later & gain access with no questions asked. When I observed from a distance the \"bouncer\" just shrugged his shoulders & smirked at me. Once my friend was let inside, he and I asked why he was able to enter but I wasn't....the bouncers excuse was he \"didn't notice\" the height of the shoe. Again...they were the same style of shoes, different colors.   Personally I've never experienced this type of profiling in Scottsdale...It's such a shame how this type of discrimination is still going on. My relationship with this establishment has come to an end."}
{"text":"Came here for Saturday brunch with some girlfriends. First off, I do love the patio area. High top tables and couches for a relaxed atmosphere. We opted for the 'endless' mimosas (and I had the Bloody Mary's) The menu was pretty much bar food...nothing great, but not bad. I had the breakfast tacos (one egg and potato, one egg and bacon and one egg and chorizo) They were not bad, but would have been better with corn tortillas or smaller flour ones because there was a LOT of tortilla for the taco! The only other thing that was irritating was the very LOUD music played by a DJ. Impossible to talk without yelling.  Service was great and we enjoyed the morning. A great spot for AZ in the spring time!"}
{"text":"Had a really good time for Sunday brunch. Great bottomless mimosas and we had a great waitress. I ordered the pulled pork hash and it came out without potatoes ( it happened to another person at my table as well) our waitress was great about getting it taken care of and the dish ended up being very good. By around noon it was ridiculously packed and it sounded like a night club inside. We couldn't hear ourselves talk. So be aware of that. Next time we will request a patio table. Maybe that will be a little better? All in all, great restaurant great food, good times. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Can't say I was super impressed with this place. I went here for drinks and apps for an alumni event and it seemed like a decent place, don't get me wrong, just nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"We used to love hanging out at RnR for Sunday Funday, but unfortunately won't be visiting this establishment again after our experience this weekend. First off, we had an AMAZING waitress, her name is Sam! (If you do end up here, get seated with her. She's on top of it and the absolute sweetest.)   Second off, they need a new doorman. Unfortunately he was the beginning of making this a bitter experience for us. I see other reviews here where dress code was a problem and it ended up being one this day as well. A friend tried to meet up with us mid day and was denied entrance for wearing sweatpants on a Sunday. Still looking very put together, might I add. But hey, no exceptions. Cool. He ended up leaving to go back to work.   Less than half an hour later we see a man next to our table dressed in sweatpants. Not put together whatsoever. Like, just rolled out of bed. Naturally this was frustrating. I actually asked the doorman why our friend was denied and this man was allowed in and he said \"That is Bill, he works in our kitchen.\" I said \"He is drinking in sandals...\" to which the doorman replied \"So? He works here. So he can dress however he wants.\"   I have issues with that logic in itself but it turns out, that is not 'Bill from the kitchen'.. he is a random man drinking on a Sunday. We asked to speak to the manager to bring this lapse in judgement to his attention. The manager approaches a short time later and upon our questioning throws up the most defensive and degrading attitude I have ever witnessed from a person in the service industry. I literally had to raise my hand to be acknowledged.   The dress code is; NO Jordan's or high tops, NO camo, NO sweatpants, NO chains. As explained thoroughly and super aggressively by the GM. Meanwhile, a female at the table next to us is decked out in camo, a man down the ways is wearing high tops, and the man behind us in gross sweatpants. I don't mean to bring up racial discrimination as it is clearly a melting pot of ethnicities at RnR, but maybe train your \"security\" to turn away Caucasian folks breaking the dress code too. Instead of telling us he stepped away and someone else must have let them all in, especially after the guy lied to my face about his reasoning. The dude isn't doing his job if that's so common.   Also, Mr. alpha male GM, you may want to attend a managerial class on how to handle situations such as that with kindness and understanding rather than on an escalated degrading power trip. Yelling that you \"can clear this place out\" and \"can fire every single one of these staff members\" is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard a manager say.. We simply wanted a sincere apology that our friend was treated that way by your doorman and to feel that you cared about the consistency of dress code enforcement. You made this the last stop on the planet for us."}
{"text":"Lunch on a weekday was not crowded and the service was prompt.  The lunch menu is fairly extensive; burgers, sandwiches and a wide variety of appetizers.    I tried a few appetizers and loved the ahi tuna tacos.  The fried mac and cheese and the jalapeno lollipops left a little to be desired."}
{"text":"We were trying to find a HH in old town Scottsdale that went to 7 and we saw that R n R's does. We got beer, wine, dirty chips, and the slider trio (a pulled pork, cheeseburger, and a bleu cheese burger). All of it was so good!!! The dirty chips had a little bit too much buffalo sauce on it for me but for $5 they were good. The drink specials for happy hour were awesome too, got a wine for less than $5 and the beers are $2 off. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Sunday funday, no one does it like this place. A dj spinning from the early AM, bottomless mimosas all around and plenty of flat screens so you don't miss ANY of your fantasy football players at any moment.       This place is loud, rambunctious and you should be prepared to be around a lot of day drunk partiers---which can be a blast if you're in the right mood. Seating is spacious and their patio is nice, but at such a club-like place, the bonus is that their food is actually good. They have a sundried tomato and goat cheese scramble that I've tried to veer away from but am too in love with. Their protein pancakes with apple butter are great for the health conscious types (or those regretting their weekend shenanigans).   The wait here can get long, but if they have their platter of gummy bears on hand, it can make the hungover hunger a little more manageable. In the long run, this is a fun place to check out, even if it's just once!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was a little sick when I visited here for the first time, so I didn't get a drink (definitely was loving their wine scale in the menu) and I only ate a little, but I am so excited to go back and stuff my face.  And get a little tipsy during happy hour...it sounds like a sweet deal!  I love the patio.  Our waiter was great...super personable (apparently I'm not because I don't recall his name) and was really good at explaining the specials, happy hour and tempting us with dessert.  Boyfriend was hungry (what's new) so we started with the chicken lollipops (basically boneless buffalo wings on sticks - i had one, as Boyfriend's weakness is wings, and they were normal wing tasting) and some parmesan fries.  it's safe to say I have a slight fry obsession...these were definitely tasty.  A lot of seasoned fries are just too much...these had a pretty perfect amount.  I got the ahi tacos for my meal...decent, and a perfect small portion for me.  The tortillas are not tortilla tortillas as most arizonans would expect, but i thought the jicama was a refreshing twist and paired well with the cold ahi.  Boyfriend got the burger and he scarfed it down before I think I even asked how it was.  A huge plus for me - our server was very attentive, keeping our water glasses constantly full (which meant refilling like 17 times).  He offered dessert, and we said no...oh, wait...no...brownie a la mode, you say? umm...yes, we must. get. brownie.  I noticed the brownie and ice cream is not on the regular menu on the website.  Not sure what that is about but it was amazing.  And we both take our desserts very seriously.  It wasn't super fudgy or cold like a lot of restaurant brownies are...it was warm, soft, crumbly and just totally scrumptious.  there definitely was a small fork fight for the last few bits of brownie and chunk of ice cream...  Their breakfast menu and delicious sounding coffee sound even better than our dinner, so I think I'll have to get up and ride my bike down there in the morning sometime soon.  Good breakfast can sometimes be hard to find...a lot of their offerings sound both healthy and yummy.  Overall, totally decent place to hang out on the patio and nosh on some small plates and drink, or enjoy the cooling weather (maybe...soon?) with a coffee.  Yay RnR!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best bloody mary I have ever had. It was the perfect combination of tomato juice, spice, vodka and bacon... yup, bacon!! My friends raved about the mimosas as well.   I really enjoyed the atmosphere at this place. The crowd grew as the day grew later. It never seemed overcrowded. The place was cool and comfortable, but the garage doors and many windows provided an outdoor feel.   The noise level did increase as the day went on (and the drinks were poured). As we were leaving it was difficult to maintain a conversation without shouting, but by that time, we had moved from the 'brunch' crowd into the 'day drinking' crowd. No judgement!   My friends all loved their omelets. Mine was okay. I am not sure if the cheese was off or maybe the fillings but something wasn't right. My friends were shocked when I mentioned this as we were leaving. They all loved the food. I will look forward to trying this spot again the next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Our first time at RnR and we were welcomed like we were part of the family. Sadie was our waitress, she helped us with tips on what to try and boy was she right. The food was absolutely perfect after a long day of cycling, the proportions are nicely balanced though huge in size for us though was very pleased with the amount we ended up taking home with us to enjoy later while the price was lower than our average trip out to eat.   In short, we had a very pleasant visit, the food was divine and the staff was perfect; loved it."}
{"text":"My list of requirements for a sports bar is pretty short--attentive servers (particularly behind the bar), lots of TVs; reasonably priced bar food; preferably big space with a couple of team affiliations.  The food prices at RnR seem a little high for Scottsdale, but the beer prices are decent and the space is huge with plenty of large-screen HDTVs.  The servers we had on the two occasions I was there this weekend were always lurking to help with refills, which was nice; I got the impression that RnR caters more to the club/nightlife scene than an actual sports bar scene, so it was an interesting mix of W Hotel clubgoers sunning themselves on the second floor balcony and people in sports jerseys watching NCAA tourney games.  (It helps that there's a DJ spinning loud pop music all the time.)  I'm a fan overall, but don't quote me on that about the food.  The two guys I went with tried the pretzel bites and the fish tacos and both reviews came back as a \"meh.\""}
{"text":"The patio here is great. As is the service.  Weve enjoyed everything weve tried here. My personal fave is the animal fries.  The margaritas are lethal, but delicious. The chambord maragarita is THE BEST. So delicious."}
{"text":"Hit RnR for lunch with some co-workers this week. The atmosphere is very open and modern but not uptight which is always nice. It was not very busy so the 6 of us got a table right away.  The menu had a nice selection of salads and sandwiches, pretty much your standard fare for lunch. I ordered a salad that included strawberries, apples, walnuts and a strawberry dressing on mixed greens. I added chicken for $3 more.  The salad was a decent size and there was a lot of chicken which was great. I hate when places make you pay extra for a piddly scrap of food. The chicken was done well and the salad was fresh. Most of my co-workers had chicken sandwiches which they gobbled up quickly.  The service was pretty quick but our waitress was a little snotty. When one of my co-workers got his sandwich with mayo (which was not mentioned on the menu) and asked for a new bun, the waitress did get him another sandwich quickly but also had to point out (with attitude) that it was aioli not mayo. Umm...isn't aioli just a fancy word for mayo mixed with something? And why would you put mayo, ahem, aioli on a sandwich that had pesto? Whatever.   I would be willing to visit RnR again and try one of their sandwiches or burgers. But hopefully I'll get a different waitress."}
{"text":"First time at RnR. Beer was super cold, great reverse happy hour, lollipop wings were amazing, SW salad was fresh. Best of all, AJ Rodriguez was strumming his tunes, wow! Great covers, awesome looping and perfect guitar strokes. Apparently he's there every Wednesday night-strongly recommend you check him out. Our server, Emma was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I went there once and enjoyed the turkey sausage egg white scramble! So delicious but my second experience changed my mind.  I would never go there on a weekend seeing how you can't even get in because it's so packed. I also went there with a few friends and they wouldn't let us in because he was wearing joggers and Nikes, it was a Saturday and all we wanted to do is get some breakfast but we couldn't even do that just because of his attire. This is a brunch spot not a club, if I wanted to go to a club I would have just gone to the entertainment district in old town. We walked across the street to Salty and had bottomless mimosas (10$ less than RnR, and way bigger!) paired with a nice brunch!"}
{"text":"We went during the day, before the \"night crowd\" hit and had a wonderful time, great drinks, really good food and atmosphere.  Only wish we could have gone to the Sunday Brunch with the unlimited Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's!!"}
{"text":"I sure am glad my roommate told me to check this place out. Kristen and I stopped by RnR the other day for a late lunch and happened to get there just in time for happy hour, my beer was less than her tea, awesome. I love the look of the place, the front door is huge and sweet, and while the inside is on the smaller side, it doesn't feel packed, and there is ample seating outside, I can't wait for the cooler weather so we can stop by more often and people watch.      We started with two appetizers, the pigs in a blanket, which are the old childhood favorite with a light and flaky pastry crust, they were delicious, and the chicken lollipops, super tender on the bone chicken with buffalo sauce, so stinking good. We then shared the pork sandwich, which had a sweet and tangy sauce that complimented the tender pork wonderfully, it was a terrific sandwich and came with a bucket of fries.      With crazy hours, good drink selections and a great happy hour, RnR is definitely worth checking out, I wish I had came here sooner."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Old Scottsdale and RnR.  We choose RnR ironically because it was the only full restaurant within eye-shot of where we parked.  It was a hot day and I wasn't sure if a half open restaurant would be cool enough (we sat inside, it was cool enough).   1. Service: The service was outstanding.  Our server apologized that they were a bit short handed on a Monday lunch hour because of unexpected crowd size.  She again apologized a couple of times while we were waiting for our lunch and afterwards.  Here's the kicker, they were prompt at ordering, serving food, and other aspects of our visit.  The staff was really friendly and sincerely cared about their service.  2. Beer:  Great selection of local craft beer and the typical brews that you would expect to see on tap.    3. Sports: Almost an overload of TVs with every sport channel playing.  Since it was a Monday afternoon, most of the shows were talking heads reviewing Sundays football game.  Go Seahawks.  4 Food: The menu featured typical/expected food at a reasonable price.  It did feature a few \"Tex-Mex\" items that I normally do not see up north.  I will return, I will recommend to anyone visiting Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Come here if you are ready to par-Tay!!! Music is too loud."}
{"text":"The burgers we're great!  Large handmade Patty. Very yummy. Service was prompt and polite.  Hip vibe with good music. HOWEVER unless you're there alone forget about communicating with anyone you may be dining with!  If you know sign language you might be ok but otherwise the music will drown out any conversation you may want to have. Went with a party of seven and unless you scream at each other you won't hear a word.  Sad. What could've been a fun evening with a slight turn of the dial turned out to be slow torture."}
{"text":"love it! D Bag extravaganza! lol. if you are a cute girl you will not leave here alone. you might get slipped a rophy and wake up next to that guy from HCwDB and regret every second of it but youll have fond memories of RnR!!  (ps- not a true story! purely fictional!)"}
{"text":"Literally the bouncer who was just at the door right now purposely snapped my boyfriends Arizona ID in half, mind you he's 25! So now he has to get a brand new one are you guys reimbursing for your bouncer being a dickhead? By the way you do know it's illegal to snap someone's ID right? I just talked to my family lawyer.. I will be contacting the manager about this, and if my family lawyer needs to get involved so be it. Hopefully it doesn't have to get to that."}
{"text":"I reunited with some old college friends at this bar. The atmosphere is fun, and I love the music! The margaritas were on special, so we decided to take advantage of half of Ritas. They hve many different favors I had the spicy mango margarita and my friend had the prickly pear margarita. The frozen Ritas are nothing special alone, so try one flavored. The spicy mango was delicious! I miss the many different margaritas available in Arizona! As somebody who has missed Arizona margaritas, I am being generous with a three star review. Does NOT compare with margaritas at Sir Vezas in Tucson, though."}
{"text":"Have visited twice and just haven't been all that impressed with the service.  Food, atmosphere and ambiance are good though."}
{"text":"Apparently you can wear any shoe but Jordan's. For that ignorance alone, I will never go back. They also routinely fail inspection. Save your money!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went there yesterday for an early dinner; we easily found parking at the \"Parking Corral\" and walked in.  There were multiple hosts waiting to greet us at the front door.   Right off the bat, we were impressed.  The patio is gorgeous, both upstairs and downstairs.  The booths are large and roomy, and I liked the long table next to the bar that can be used for couples or large parties.  They have an amazing wine cabinet, if you can call it that, more like a wine wall, that I'm trying to convince my boyfriend we need in our house.   We decided to go with the Apple & Gorgonzola salad and the Chicken Sandwich...the chicken sandwich has brie, basil pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes, nothing short of amazing.  As for the salad, they use a prickly pear vin, which pairs sinfully well with it. :)  Just the right amount or gorgonzola, not overpowering at all. He went with Blue Moon on tap and I chose Sangre de Toro for my wine.  We've been drinking Toro at home for years, and it's the first time I've seen it out and about at a bar.  Instant plus. Overall, we had a great time, and the price wasn't bad at all!  I was expecting to pay much more for what we received.  RnR...we're fans!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Eh.    So I was back in Scottsdale. I raved to my boyfriend how awesome this place was-- the drinks, the apps, the environs.  I was disappointed.  The clientele and the atmosphere were a big disappointment. We went on a Sunday night during Labor Day weekend and the clientele looked like the I-just-turned-21 folks.  It wouldn't be so bad had I not been here before and experienced a more sophisticated crowd.  But then... the bathroom.  It was nasty.  Although the restaurant was not crowded at all (maybe a third full), you would think that it was a Saturday night at a club.  There were drinks on the toilet, toilet paper on the floor, and... well, it was just dirty.  I'm a runner so I am used to port-a-potties, but when I'm at an establishment that served chicken lollipops and bleu cheese sliders, I expect not to see a toilet paper on the floor at different stalls.    There are a bunch of other gastropubs in Old Town and SoDo. I will explore other places before I go back to RnR again."}
{"text":"I've shot into here on a few occasions for drinks and food and it's always been a meeeh type experience.  The food and drinks are a bit on the pricey scale for the quality and service is decent.  It kind of leaves you craving for more.  The outdoor seating is pretty good though with a linear but open space seating, outdoor bar and louge area."}
{"text":"MUST HAVE A RESERVATION for brunch. Or plan on waiting around a good part of your morning to be seated. Would be ok if you are taking advantage of the bottomless drinks. The place is on the side of the street where you are not getting hammered in sun even if you sit on any of the out door seating! So a prime spot for the heat of the summer. Pricing was so-so. To take advantage of the $15 bottomless drinks you must each have a full entree. So out check before tip was $70."}
{"text":"If you're coming for any reason other than bottomless mimosas/blood marys, you are a fool. When RnR opened up and offered the bottomless drinks with brunch it seemed like everywhere in old town followed suit (no complaints). It's best to come here with the intention of day drinking or when you had a late night the night before and you're looking for some shampoo effect action. I don't think the food is really very good at all (hence the 3 stars), but I look past it for the mimosas. Some servers are really good about filling up the bottomless drinks a lot and some aren't, in which case you just have to remind them, or chug every time they come to your table. Staff has always been really friendly when I've gone. Advice though...if you're not feeling like getting your drink on at breakfast, you're gonna hate yourself for going, hate all of your friends, and never want to go back (at least that's what I hear). Get here as early as you can though, or else you will be waiting a while and the clock will be ticking for the bottomless mimosa cut off. I've had a lot of fun times here.   Bottom Line: You're gonna be drunk, it's gonna be loud, and hopefully you didn't make any plans for productivity the rest of the day."}
{"text":"THE WORST. Don't come here. Service was awful. Food was decent, bartender was awful. Had ZERO personality and literally acted like we were doing her a disservice by sitting at the bar. We sat down at a dirty bar top (mind you there was NO ONE sitting at the bar) because no one came to greet us we got up and grabbed a rag and wiped down our sticky area ourselves, then when the bar top was wet we asked for napkins to dry it off when it was clearly soaking wet. She messed up my boyfriends dinner, but we didn't say anything. She didn't give us silverware or napkins so I had to walk to another table and take them off the table because she never came to ask us if we needed anything so we just waited to eat our food because we didn't have utensils. I ordered a cocktail and she handed it to me without a straw or fruit (it was a vodka/soda) my boyfriends drink sat empty for at least 5 minutes & she cleared my food without even asking if he wanted another drink. Again- service was awful. No wonder the place was empty on a Saturday night. Music, ambience and location are on point, sad miss though."}
{"text":"honestly, the food isn't half bad. THe mac and cheese is amazing. Theres a great variety and lots of bar service, however, they way the treat their employees is disgusting. i was there eating one night, a table next to make CLEARLY mead a mistake from being too intoxicated, threw a drink on (think the hostestess  name was Beth or something) and even thought she wasn' t the server, she made my night a million time better. She had a real conversation with me and brought me plenty of free beverages to make up for it. However, the manager didn't see how hard she was working (bussing too many tables to handle and too many people to handle) and completely disregarded her efforts.. Our ticket was also off by SEVERAL dollers, Kim, the manager came to handle it and instead of comping out meal she gave out free coupons for a drink nexr visit....which there wont me. I hate this place to say is the least"}
{"text":"Cool place to get some food and drinks before a Giants spring training game. We'll be back next year!!! #GoGiants"}
{"text":"A bit trendy and overpriced but you get what you pay for in Old Town. Everything from drinks to appetizers to meals was high quality, small portions, high priced. People were pretty, happy hour is always hopping and EVERYONE IS HAVING FUN. We will be back, on payday...."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely rude and not helpful at all when my cell phone was taken off of our table. In fact, they called the police and had us removed. Unfortunately, this place will still get business. I will never return."}
{"text":"Amazing Chamboard French toast! Service was friendly, and very helpful! They were always topping off our bottomless mimosas, and it was well worth it. We went at 10:00 am on a Sunday. No DJ yet and some upbeat country was playing for the perfect vibe!  Also, our server was Emily, and she was beyond wonderful!!"}
{"text":"Have you ever been talking with your friends and they begin to tell you how great of a swimmer they are? Then they run and belly flop and begin to just sink to the bottom? No?? I haven't either, but if i had, this would be that friend.  Considering that this place boasts its presence with being right in old town Scottsdale you think they would have experience, food, and service.   I contemplated 1 star but that would be unfair to the first server who did a great job.   Shall we continue? Upon arriving they seemed busy inside and didn't have a table ready. My party had already been sitting and waiting for awhile when the rest of us arrived. They had 2 small children and 1 pregnant woman. Let's have them sit outside without water for awhile. Thats what we did. Finally a server came over and brought us water promptly.  Kind of a big deal to not be aware of your waiting patrons (especially if all you have is outdoor waiting in ARIZONA.)   Once seated, server came over, said hi and left. (i don't know why the rest of my party left their waters outside, i brought mine in). She never brought over or asked us if we would like waters. I guess seeing one cup for 8 people is sufficient.  Well 10 minutes later a group walks in same size and sits in the booth across from us. As we wait for our server to come back and take our order 20-25 minutes later, she instead goes to take the order of our neighbors. Um hi..we are waiting still.   After long awkward anticipation of trying to \"flag her down\" (granted she could have been busy, but she was chatting with the hostesses a lot, so who knows) she comes over and takes our long awaited dinner orders..we are striding along 45-50 minutes to take our order. When the other group was promptly attended to (10-15min). Oh heck yes i really was timing..   Order goes, 10 minutes  later appetizers come out and 1hr later (yes i realize it takes awhile to get food out especially 8 dishes) our dinner comes, or i think it is our dinner. We had 3 messed up orders. 3 overly cooked burgers..i tasted them it was so dry not even drink our 1 cup of water between 8 people could re hydrate that.  I mean i am a guy, most things can be fixed for me with just a GOOD (not even great) meal. But they couldn't even capitalize on that.. I am pretty sure a \"good\" meal could have come through better.  Heh, my meal was some chicken sandwich, thank God it was cooked all the way through. It was definitely slopped together. There was a GLOB of sundried tomatoes placed only in the middle, showing me that they cared so much to just ladle out the st's. I mean it was okay, but nothing i'd pay that much.  Hey i am a nice guy, lets talk about our neighbors.. by the time we got our food they were done eating and paying for their bill (they had 7 people). hmmm  i could go on, but really...whats the point? you get the idea...i wont be back"}
{"text":"If you can't tell from my other reviews, I'm always skeptical of super trendy restaurants. When the staff looks like something out of an Abercrombie and Fitch ad, I start to worry. In my experience that usually means indifferent service and overly thought out food.  But the food, drinks, and service at RnR won us over.  We went for happy hour. We walked in around 6:30 to pounding house music and gorgeous twenty somethings that were obviously laying around the pool all day. Loud music and food don't usually mix well for me when it is still daylight.  The hostesses were very friendly and our server was great. He was much more down to earth then I thought service here would be. He was wonderful in describing the menu and making suggestions.  My husband had the animal fries and the ahi tacos. His eyes almost bulged out of his head when the fries came. As a vegetarian I was slightly repulsed by this carnivorous mess of a plate, but he was in pig and potato heaven. He liked his tacos too but was slightly annoyed he can eat them in 3 bites.  I had the portabello sandwich. It was good but not great. The bread was too thick and got soggy very quickly by the watery marinade of the mushroom. I definitely want to try something else out next time we go. The parmesean fries it came with were heavenly.   Drinks were good and priced awesome for happy hour. I had a mango pepper margarita. I liked the first few sips but there was something about the flavor I didn't like. My husband thought it was delicious and finished it for me.  If we are in the area we will definitely stop by RnR again. I want to try their boozy Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Pretty all-around terrible experience at RnR last week, between the food, the drinks, the service, and the cleanliness.  I had heard about the place for a while so I suggested it to my group of 4.  We decided to pay a visit during the early evening.  It's a very nice space with Scottsdale-attractive staff...and that's about where the positive part of this review ends.   Upon arrival we ordered four cocktails from their \"signature\" cocktail list, then watched as muscles the bartender read a cheat sheet on exactly how to make them. While the bartender was clearly struggling with the \"signature\" cocktails, we ordered several shared appetizers--which came out long before the cocktails ever arrived.  The food was cold and some items were not cooked all the way through--maybe a product of them being rushed to our table for some reason.  \"Baked\" brie was cold and unmelted, and the much-hyped animal fries looking like they'd been under a heat lamp for hours (but still cold)...the only decent thing was the shrimp tacos, but it's pretty hard to screw up a fried shrimp taco. Then the cocktails arrived, and perhaps predictably, they all came out looking and tasting awful; just the wrong balance of flavors and not mixed correctly.  The ice had melted because of the time spent trying to mix them.  And two of them kinda tasted like rubbing alcohol. Or gasoline.  Our server had disappeared from the beginning, leaving us with runners who would only say \"I'll get your server\" whenever we had even the simplest of requests--like: \"can we get some side plates?\" \"I'll get your server.\"  Finally, fifteen minutes after the food arrived, the server came by and provided us with side plates for the shared appetizers.  Not that we needed them at that point, but the side plates were still very wet from being washed and several had food residue on them. Disgusting. After the four terrible $13 cocktails, cold appetizers, poor service, and dirty plates, we decided to pack in our planned dinner and head down the street to a place that knew how to mix a drink and cook.  Of course, it took forever to get our check because the server pulled another disappearing act for about 20 minutes, and when the check came, we were shocked at how much all this awfulness cost: almost $90 to be fed cold food and bad drinks while being ignored.  Sorry RnR, but we're never coming back and we've told many people to do the same."}
{"text":"Oh my god!  You guys gotta try RNR's new SouthWest Charcoal burger.  I recommend you order it medium, just to make sure they cook it for the good 35 min the burger deserves.  My first bite was phenomenal.   Reminded me of a BBQ with my friends, cooking burgers but then eating the charcoal instead.    I would give this review 5 stars, but my burger tasted a little too much like burger and not enough like charcoal.  I hope you guys enjoy the charcoal taste as much as I did."}
{"text":"Good, great, amazing.  Yes I pick amazing. Saturday was fun day. Kevin was awesome, very attentive, and knows his s&#@  come here it's great."}
{"text":"I went to RnR on a Sunday morning. i actually attempted to go for my first time but left because the wait was 40 minutes. The second time it was only a 25 minute wait which is actually great for Old Town on a Sunday. I really enjoyed my meal! I had heard mixed reviews about their food but I went with 4 other people and everyone enjoyed their breakfast. the real reason we went was because they have bottomless bloody mary's AND mimosas for an extra 15 dollars until 2pm. Definitely worth it if you make it a competition between you and the restaurant to see how many you can finsih to get your money's worth. You do have to purchase a breakfast item to get this 15 dollar bottomless deal but it is probably a good idea to eat when drinking that much anyway. Just be aware you can't switch between mimosas and bloody mary's so make sure to choose wisely. The only complaint that I had was the noise level was soooooo loud! This place is open from 8am to 2am because it turns into a club at night. However, I don't think they adjust their music volume depending on the time of day which can be a little much for the morning and when you are trying to chat with friends."}
{"text":"Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol Honestly my lunch was just okay Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype  But, I am supposed to be honest.  This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.  The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it.   One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.  The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.  I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily.   I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.  So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops.   What I paid for this was ridiculous. The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous. The food was meh. Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there. It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.  One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.  Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!"}
{"text":"This is the quintessential football or Spring Training spot. Look no farther, trust me.  Mornings before Spring Training, they have $15 bottomless mimosas and the place turns into... well... a shitshow. But in the best way possible. Do not come here during Spring Training/ Football games, unless you're ready to party. If you are, great. Imbibe abundantly with classy champagne glasses and then rage-stumble to the diamond.   -Music is great, live DJ's -Great food, considering -Get their gravy on the side: it's chunky, creamy, a tad spicy.. and comforting, everything I want in a gravy. YUM"}
{"text":"After a wild night out you'll probably find yourself hungover and lazy the next morning looking for a good place to go for breakfast/brunch.  Well look no further because I have the solution for your problem.  RnR has now claimed a special spot in my heart as the go to place for my hangover breakfast cravings.  Went here Saturday morning (11:00-ish) and it was pretty crowded with a lot of the people you probably saw the night before.  There was a DJ playing great music to put you in a good mood and you see Mimosas and Bloody Mary's on almost every table.  They have a bottomless option for those drinks so for $15 you can get as many as you want, they just keep coming around and filling them up again.  Dangerous but delicious!  The food is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I was trying to be kind of good so I ordered the protein pancakes and you never really know how that's going to turn out but let me tell you, these were some of the best pancakes of any kind I've ever had!  They have blueberries in them, granola on top and come with a good amount of apple butter to spread.  They bring syrup along with them but honestly you don't even need it because they're so good.  My friend ordered the Bleu Cheese Burger which was delicious as well.  The flavors blended really well together, it was cooked perfectly and you could tell the meat was high quality.  All this being said, I think it's pretty clear that you'll know where to find me in the early-ish hours of the weekend."}
{"text":"I came here a lot during football season, and this place is a madhouse on Sundays! Great brunch and really good bloody marys! Service was very delayed but I figured it was just because of how packed the place was at the time!  Unfortunately I went back on a normal day when it wasn't slammed and the service was the same way... The servers are all pretty friendly... when they finally get around to taking care of you...  Other than slow service, I can't complain much. The food is tastefully prepared, the margaritas are AWESOME (and potent), and if you swing through here during happy hour or reverse happy hour, you can have some food and drinks on a pretty cheap budget!"}
{"text":"Although the music was a little on the loud side, this is a fun, casual hangout.  We didn't have any appetizers or food but I caught a glimpse of someone's order of nacho style kettle chips & they looked delicious!  I had a strawberry frozen margarita & it was very refreshing.   Most of the people were college aged which was expected considering the location.  I would recommend stopping by with friends.  Not a date type of environment."}
{"text":"Waitress/ bartenders are cute. We didnt eat. We just got a drink and left. Only like 5 beers on tap but no worries. They even gave one of my friends a band-aid lol. Their mix drink prices are a bit outrageous tho.. 3 beers for 10 or so.. 15 alone for a double of jack and coke."}
{"text":"I'm just not a 'scene' person.  I'm just not.  Nice patio both upstairs and downstairs but honestly, it's a bit of a hot mess.  I have been a few times and I'm officially going to tell people \"hell no\" when they suggest this place.  I recently made the mistake of attemting to go to this place on Sunday for gameday.  Oh good lord.  No tvs and a DJ so loud your ears rang.  yeah yeah they have bottomless mimosas, but I can't drink that for hours.  And who drinks mimosas with football?    Now, while this place may not scream \"football watching', I have been there just on a normal day and I nearly stepped in vomit.    personally this is just not my scene."}
{"text":"I came here one Friday night to meet a couple friends on the patio because they actually have a really good DJ. Too bad there's no dancing.   We ordered the chicken lollipops and the shrimp appetizers. They were so small, we each only got one, which was unexpected. The chicken wasn't very good, but the shrimp was really yummy. The prices were ridiculous for drinks (I ended up getting a bottled beer) and their tiny apps, plus our waitress was virtually nonexistent. What's worse is that the music was set so loudly that I couldn't hear my friend across the coffee table. We were constantly shouting \"WHAT??\" every five minutes, which is really annoying after a point. Not a great location for chit chatting on the patio with friends at night. Next time I think I'll try talking my friends into RA instead."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if looking for a mellow Sunday brunch.  Its more like Spring Break at 10am in January.  Two hour waits for tables and music so loud you would think that it was a night club, if not for the breakfast and daylight."}
{"text":"This is a great place to sit on the patio when it's nice out and people watch (all the bros and all the older rich couples) in downtown Scottsdale.  The service and management are phenomenal and super welcoming!  I especially recommend the Mac & Cheese.  it's ridiculous!!!!  (ask for bacon!!!)  Give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"Good food and an entertaining atmosphere. This is by far the best bar to come to on Sunday's for bottomless mimosas. The service isn't always the quickest because it gets so packed (be sure to get there early or you won't get in)! However, the servers are usually fairly nice, and tolerant of being surround by highly intoxicated people. Steve is the best on Sunday's, he has this backpack that he uses to fill up mimosas, although we haven't seen it in a while. They also have great food, it's a good place to grab snacks as well."}
{"text":"So....I caved and I've been back to RnR and this time around, it was a LOT better.   The bartenders are nice, the service I've had has definitely exceeded my last experience....the only thing I haven't really tried is the menu. Even though I see RnR as more of a way to start the night with a few drinks vs a sit down dinner...guess I'll just have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:30 and the place was nearly empty, but we were still told there would be a 45 min wait. Okay fine. Maybe they have reservations. We ended up finding some seating at the bar since we only had two in our party. First of all, as a bartender, I can say that the attitudes weren't bad per se. It just seemed like they couldn't be bothered to do their job. I get it. You work at the busiest place in the area for brunch. Poor you for making hundreds of dollars in a weekend. The least you can do is smile. We ordered bottomless mimosas, but were informed that the price depended on whether or not we also got food. The first two rounds of drinks were decent. After that, they started adding more orange juice. And as the place got busier, our drinks got weaker. We ordered food and sat around for a bit, chatting and catching up with each other as the place filled to capacity. When I finished my fourth mimosa, I noticed one of the bartenders filling one of the mimosa pitchers with something from the bar gun. I placed my hand over my glass and asked what exactly was being added to the simplest of drinks. Soda water. Half he pitcher was soda water. A quarter was orange juice and the last quarter was champagne. So if you're looking to sip some bubbly and get a nice buzz on a Sunday, I'd say this isn't the place. Just okay food doesn't make up for the watered down drinks, apathetic attitudes and longer than necessary wait times. I predict this place won't last long."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unimpressive in most regards.  It is in a good location, but the food is poor.  I have tried several different dishes there (don't ask me why I have been there multiple times).  We would often go as a big group to catch games, and it was never that much fun.  Service is average at best... Do your self a favor and find somewhere else to, especially in old town there are SO MANY better options"}
{"text":"Cool place, does get crowded but the food is great.    They have heaters outside if it starts to get too chilly and the service is alright. For the most part it's definitely aimed more for the younger crowds"}
{"text":"I made a return trip with my family for breakfast.  The server was very attentive and the food was still fantastic.  Even better, RnR is now on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485) with a $30 or $15 gift certificate.  A great way to save at this Scottsdale hot spot!"}
{"text":"I've driven by this place 100 times and never gone and in fact even tonight I tried to go next-door and they were on a 45 minute wait so I decided to give R&R a shot wow what an amazing place our server was so friendly. I'm ready to pack up and go to her small town and see if everyone that lives there is as friendly and cute as her. Management you are definitely lucky to have a server  like Sydney on staff.  I eat out every meal pretty much and have for the last 30 years and she is up there with the top of the top.  I'm a Diet Coke drinker and she never left my glass more then 1/2 empty and would constantly greet us with a smile  I had a turkey burger which was wonderful and looked so good  took a picture of it for Snapchat and I never snap food tasted great too.  I don't think I've ever had brussels sprouts at a restaurant but damn these were good.  My friend had the shrimp tacos and I'm still pissed off she didn't give me a bite they look really good  We will definitely be back and it was just day 1  of this years Giants spring-training thanks for flying the world champion Giants flags to each month of March  Oh and one more thing if you could make Sydney follow me back on Instagram that be great :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger...fries...ehhhh. But pretty decent happy hour specials. Cool vibe and view but typical sports bar. Service was good but it was early and not crowded...I will give it another shot...prolly like 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, after three years of being in spring training. We came because the San Francisco Giants former teammate was hosting a charity event for his nonprofit. They allowed for other players to host as bartenders, with the help of the regular bartending. The food was incredible, I had ordered the fish tacos. The price was rather decent for a Gastro pub and Amanda our server was incredible, having remembered my friend who had been in Arizona and at that location only a few months before hand."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning after a busy night out in Old Town. Waited twenty-thirty mins for a table. Once we got a table waited fifteen mins for our waiter. He screwed up our order but I was to hungover to care and could barely eat anyway! Very nice establishment and very trendy at the moment, but I won't be coming back. Customer service was just awful!   Food was so-so and I heard it is worth it during happy hour."}
{"text":"10/01/13  Came in to use a Local Dines certificate expiring tonight.  It being a Tuesday, I could've taken advantage of their bruschettas, cheese and charcuterie plates, and beverage specials (wine and other beverages) offered on Tuesdays and Wednesdays from 7p to close, but since I had a discounted certificate, I had to postpone trying these out until another time.  Instead, I decided to check out a couple of RnR's burgers and a pint of Angry Orchard cider ($6).  The cider was served very cold (perfect after I slipped a koozie on the glass) and tasted \"mah-velous, absolutely mah-velous!\"  Server Sibby/Siby was friendly and upbeat, as well as patient with all my questions regarding the food and beverage menus, as well as a few concerns I had regarding ingredients on a few dessert items.  Not once did she make me feel like I was a burden.  I wouldn't hesitate to ask to be seated at her tables!  Not only was Sibby a delight to have as a server, but she was also a great help in steering me towards the right direction when I asked her which of the two was better, sweet potato fries or tots (she said tots; I asked if I could go half-and-half, and she said yes) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=8z6nhnprgC3psPCRuAiH-Q#8z6nhnprgC3psPCRuAiH-Q, as well as my checking out the Bacon Brussels Burger, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=46gN0ZHqMW8--oYt-Y5I_w#46gN0ZHqMW8--oYt-Y5I_w which would still taste great without the raspberry demi glace (which contained cornstarch, an ingredient I'm allergic to).  This burger tasted wonderful!  Made with jarlsberg cheese, applewood bacon, fried Brussels sprouts, onion jam, and a pretzel bun, this burger was definitely sweeter in flavor (due to the toastiness of the sprouts, as well as the addition of the onion jam- heaven!) and made for an agreeable contrast after the few bites I had of the Southwest Burger.  The salty (but in a good way!), pleasing number consisted of pepperjack cheese, chopped green chiles, smoked bacon, crispy onion straws, and a garlic aioli, nestled in a challah bun.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rnr-scottsdale?select=sWWUYOIEaqrmxOe2hqpzfg#sWWUYOIEaqrmxOe2hqpzfg  I had to opt out of the guacamole, but I didn't think it suffered from its absence.  As for the parmesan fries that came with the second burger, I didn't care much for them, because one, they weren't very flavorful, despite the addition of the parmesan, and two, the presentation wasn't as nice as it could've been, and had they tasted great, the presentation would not have mattered.  Next time, I'm going with lots and lots of sweet potato tots!"}
{"text":"RnR is one of those places that we seem to go to every time we have a visitor in town and want to brunch. The atmosphere is always guaranteed to be rowdy and loud, which I don't see as a negative at all given what the restaurant is supposed to be- a fun spot to have brunch and get tipsy off mimosas while listening to a live DJ.   The food is pretty decent, but nothing exceptional to write home about. I've had a ton of items on their brunch menu and since I don't expect anything stellar I'm not usually disappointed. One food item I would definitely stay away from though is their bacon brussel sprouts. Theirs are steamed and they're served in a little dish with a ton of water still surrounding them. They really should start pan sautéing them or something because they just simply aren't enjoyable at all.   The main reason I give this place only 3 stars is because I feel like the employees aren't super friendly, and the restaurant has a reputation of some shady practices. Bottomless mimosas for 15 bucks when you buy an entree- great! Bottomless mimosas that are mostly OJ with a very small amount of champagne and sometimes even WATER added- not so great. In my opinion they should either increase the cost of bottomless mimosas to have actual quality drinks, or just scrap the thing. Also, the bouncer is pretty rude. You don't need someone mean mugging every person that walks through the door in order to get IDs checked. Hire people who are friendly, not just willing to show up and get the job done."}
{"text":"This place is a nice Sunday Funday spot. They have a really good mimosa brunch special. It can get really crowded on weekend days and service can lack. If you plan on going for brunch I recommend going really early because there can be a two hour wait."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  The all you can drink is great, but it was so busy they didn't bring utensils with the food and we had to find them.   Hard to talk with the music so loud.  This is the first time I've eaten here and although I am told the food is awesome, I had the \"Amish French Toast\" which had ONE strawberry sliced up and had a charred taste.   I definitely won't order that again.   They were very good with keeping the all you can drink mimosa coming."}
{"text":"Bottomless Mimosas on Sunday's!  A local stable when I'm looking to black out on a Sunday Funday! Must have the bottomless mimosas if looking for a good time."}
{"text":"I really like RnR.  My wife and I have brunch here occasionally.  The food is delicious and I like the atmosphere.  It's classy, yet comfortable without being too trendy.    I haven't been after dark because I'm not a fan of the late night crowd.  But I can say that it's a safe place to enjoy during the day.    In fact, I have just talked myself into going there today.  See you there!"}
{"text":"Super yummy!   We had dinner and drinks with friends on the patio downstairs.  All of the staff were STELLAR!  Super friendly and attentive.    The bleu burger was yummy...and the fries fantastic!  Love the decor inside..the bathroom fixtures appear to need some attention."}
{"text":"Food- 2.5 Stars Service-.5 Stars  This place is great for that Saturday or Sunday morning cure for the hangover.  Their Sunday special for endless bloody mary and memosas is fantastic.  You used to be able to pay $10 for the bloodies and $15 for the memosas however now you have to purchase a breakfast ENTREE as well as the $10 or $15 for the drinks.  I think this is a bit steep, I know you are in Scottsdale but either discount the fee for the booze if you have to buy the breakfast or allow a customer to purchase breakfast entree and drink.  The bloody marys however are very cool...they put all the original fixings but then throw a piece of dried bacon in the center of the glass which is especially helpful if you are trying to cure that hangover we talked about earlier.  The ambience of the venue is cool very Scottsdale with limited amount of D-bags (except fo your servers which I'll cover in a moment).  Great place for happy hour or to catch a game and can generally find an area to hang out.  The reason I have not been back to RnR in a while is because the service is absolutely terrible.  I have gone at least 15 times and keep telling myself that next time the service will be better and that I'll try it again however I keep ending up disappointed.  Every time I have been (which is on Sunday for the endless booze) my waiter or waitress walks around pouting and unresponsive the entire time we are there.  I know you were probably out partying the night before and the last thing you want to do is be at work with people ordering booze and booze and breakfast, but if you hate your job so much quit.  I will probably give this place another try simply because their blood marys outweigh the terrible service, but if any MANAGEMENT is reading this they need to do a complete clean out of all their employees and start fresh or this place will eventually close."}
{"text":"3.5 rounded up to 4.   We had a HUGE group the other day four the NCAA tourney and I was impressed with most everything at RNR. Whoever organized the party was able to get them to reserve a large space for all of us and our two waiters did an awesome job of keeping track of the many, many credit cards that were down for the event.   Ridiculously cheap drink specials ($2.50 beers, $3.50 cocktails) all afternoon and a pretty darn tasty burger and fries. All of this was, of course, happy hour prices and my wife and I got out of there thoroughly hammered and no longer hungry for under 50 bucks. I couldn't believe it.   I'm very likely to come back here again."}
{"text":"Group of gals and I decided to come here for brunch since the menu looked delicious and well, bottomless mimosas. As we were walking in that direction, the music just kept getting louder, Louder and LOUDER. Good music, but LOUD. Couldnt even hear myself talk. Lol it was SO packed! Ppl spilling out onto the sidewalk. Butt to butt- hip to hip! Ppl bumping into you like crazy. We were told the wait was an hr for a table and so we decided to wait it out near the bar where we eventually got our mimosas. Some batches better than others. After waiting over an hour, we checked w the hostess and thats where we were informed we still had 10 ppl in front of us!! We left. Obviously the waitlist system needs some work. It made no sense! We werent able to try the food. Def a college bar/club/rave were ppl sat at tables and just drank! Maybe ill try this place out again on a weekday while folks are at school. Idk."}
{"text":"Bunch of pretty wanna bees run this place. Food is so so."}
{"text":"My party of 7 arrived at RnR around 9:50am  on 3/23/14 and was not seated until 12:30pm. We understood we had a larger group and so it might be a longer wait. We really wanted to eat and take part in their bottomless mimosas. Upon arrival the greeters estimated 1 hour which we were fine with. If we had been quoted 2 hours or 3 we would have been ok with that too, but we were told 1 hour.   We kept getting skipped over and by the 2 hour mark we were very unhappy. The greeter tried giving us a table for 4 and when we told her that wouldn't work she rolled her eyes at us like we were inconviencing her.  While continuing to wait around tables were leaving but other people who were just lingering around snagged the tables because there wasn't anyone around to see it happen or tell them they had to wait if they wanted a table.  The only person who seemed to care that we had then been waiting almost 3 hours was the server Shannon. She did everything she could to find us a table and eventually let us sit outback on the picinic style tables to eat which we greatly appreciated. If we had known that was an option all along we wouldn't have waited 3 hours. Once we sat down outside a table was ready inside. After that the service was just ok.   I understand it is a popular spot on a Sunday morning but there needs to be a better system to regulate tables."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Sunday sports places. Have been here a few football Sunday's. They have a Bloody Mary and Mimosa special during select hours. The food is delicious. I have sampled many things on their menu over the last year. Haven't had a disappointing meal. My only gripe is the staff. They don't have enough bartenders working during busy sports days. The waitstaff is pleasant but they are slow."}
{"text":"Not good. Server was awful. Wished I sat at the bar - she knew what she was doing. Watch out if you sit on ground floor - dbags on 2nd level susceptible to dropping beer. Security does nothing. Not going back..."}
{"text":"Their nachos and their soft pretzel is pretty good. Also heard about their bottomless mimosa on Sunday, other than that this place didnt offer too great of service or food"}
{"text":"Sometimes people make choices that negatively impact ones life. Choosing RnR is one of these. Worst turkey burger ever. Way over cooked. The pictured nachos where $17.... now I'm not concerned with the price if they are worth it but I've had better nachos from circle K"}
{"text":"Erika Ricketts was an amazing server!! Kendel is behind the bar woot woot! Made my bloody extra picante!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday evening for quick drink and appetizer. My date ordered a cosmopolitan and it took forever to get it. He asked me if they were making it from stretch? Nevertheless, we ordered nachos to share and it was good. Our waitress was attentive and nice. I loved the televisions and variety. The music was kind of boring but I'm sure others love it. Overall a good experience and I'll be back for bottomless drinks. I didn't give 5 stars because of slow service at first, parking lot and mus"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the cute waitresses attired in yoga pants.  The slider trio was a fail, as well as the bacon avocado sandwhich tasted like the bacon was cooked a least a day previous as well as the bacon on the slider trio.  If you guys want to succeed you better think beyond spandex and care about the food you serve."}
{"text":"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both, and there you have...a 3 star review. RnR isn't overall mediocre. There's good aspects, and not good aspects, and that's why I'm giving it an A-OK review.   I've been wanting to stop in RnR since I moved back to AZ. I had heard it was a good HH & brunch spot so a group of us stopped in the morning after a pretty debauchorous Friday night. From what I understand this place is always crowded for weekend brunch, but I should point out this was the morning of Pat's Run in Tempe so this place was PACKED.  Here's what I liked:    The atmosphere & $10 all you can drink mimosas. I just moved back to AZ about a year ago from San Francisco and this place kind of reminded me of a lot of places there. It's hard to find weekend brunch spots in Scottsdale/Phoenix that do all you can drink mimosas (there's a lot of places that offer deals of some sort, but not all you drink), so I'm glad RnR does it.   I like the layout of RnR. Both the patio & inside are nice, and I like the huge tables for big groups. There's a shade that can be pulled down to separate the inside and outside or it can be left open, which gives the place a roomier feel.   Here's what I didn't like:  The food & the DJ playing at 10 am. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit and it really wasn't all that good. The sausage tasted like it was a frozen patty heated up in the microwave and the eggs were really overcooked. This biscuit it was served on was really good, though. It also came w/a side of potatoes that were kind of cold.   As far as the DJ in the morning...I mean, I don't mind that this place was crowded, but I don't wanna feel like I'm at a club when the sun is out. Granted, after a couple glasses of champagne things were more bearable (okay, maybe even fun with some of the older hip-hop being played), but at the end of the day I could have done without the loud music in the morning.   For how crowded RnR was  I thought the service was good. We waited MUCH longer than we were told for a table (and we were already told a very long time), but like I said it was REALLY crowded due to Pat Run's so giving people wait times was probably a total crapshoot.   I still want to try RnR for happy hour. And honestly, despite that not-so-good food and loud music I'd probably come back for brunch as long they're serving up $10 all you drink mimosas."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for brunch. I miss NY's AYCD brunch specials on the weekends. The food wasn't bad (omelet and tacos), and the mimosas were okay. It was nice that we were able to grab drinks by the bar while we waited for our table (and not have it cut into our time).   It's loud, crowded, and can get a little crazy.   It's also Old Town Scottsdale with an AYCD special.   You have been warned."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped here for one last drink and a late burger after some bar hopping in Old Town. It was pretty quiet which was a good thing at this point in the night. We both got burgers and were both WOWED on our first bite. One of the best burgers in my life, full of flavor. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"In order of priority given the time I was there and I was not nearly as hungry as my partner in crime:  5 stars - space, layout, bar, wine wall that goes on for miles, and the bathrooms are sweet..yeah, I said that..  4 stars - the coffee is great, the breakfast burrito, a downright treat 4 stars - the bar and glass ware is out of this world...where did you get those coffee cups, I want one... 2 stars - the service, we waited and waited and waited a good 30 minutes for a...wait for it...a single breakfast burrito with a few potatoes at 9:30 in the am on a Saturday...the restaurant was empty with the exception of a few patio dwellers and a crazy amount of staff.  So, RnR you are really really pretty but I can't bring you home to mom and dad because well, like you are not real stable if you know what I mean, but I will party with you any day!"}
{"text":"Came for the bottomless mimosas and bloodies. The food used to be great. Now it's sub par. My woman got a breakfast sandwich. When sausage patties were bland. I got the pulled pork hash which was ok as far as flavor goes the pork was a little dry though. All in all its worth coming here for the drink specials"}
{"text":"Chillin' @RnR! I love this place! They are very accommodating! Plus, how can u go wrong w/ 1/2 off wines?! Support this place people! K bye!  P.s. Chicken lollipops & ahi tacos = muy bueno!"}
{"text":"I really like RnR. Actually, love it. I wish it was easier to get a seat on Sunday funday but the secret is out and therefore this place is packed. I got these amazing little tiny ahi tacos, they were so fresh, so awesome. I wish I would have taken a pic as the menu description is super descriptive, but not what you imagine you are getting....they are better!  These are literally one to two bites max but soooo worth it! I seriously could eat like twelve. The chicken lollipops in honey jalapeno sauce are amazing. They are soooo good! My boyfriend gets those everytime. He introduced me this fine, fun establishment it has yet to be a let down.   Service staff, well some of the staff can be null/non existent or brain dead so just a heads up, don't go here on a time crunch or a short fuse. The food, atmosphere and drinks are great though. Just be aware that occaisonally there is a farmer's market located in the parking lot, therefore, there is no parking that is convienent on those particular Sundays....cheers :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by RnR for some breakfast before the Giants game, and was more than happy with my meal. Had the bottomless mimosas for 15 bucks...as well as the breakfast sandwich on their buttermilk biscuits. If you're in old town Scottsdale on a weekend morning...this place was great."}
{"text":"Nothing can save a business that adds a 3%processing tech fee. The place has been pretty marginal for some time. The last visit they closed at 9:30 on a Thursday night. Now they add a fee many times what any decent card present processing company charges, and they don't tell you. it's known as death throws when a location goes this insane, hopefully, a new operator can get something new before the season starts. As locals, we will never be in any place associated with this bunch. This is from their site: Bevvy Gastropub, Bottled Blonde Pizzeria + Beer Garden, Hi Fi Kitchen & Cocktails, Maya Day + Nightclub, The Mint Ultra Lounge, Livewire Entertainment Venue, RnR Gastropub and Sandbar Mexican Grill. I was told Livewire is closing, so it makes sense."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with a friend for happy hour. For a drink and an appetizer off the Happy Hour Menu, we each paid $10 plus tip. The food was delicious. I haven't fully explored the menu yet but I'd recommend the Chicken Lollipops (ya I said that right) or the Animal Fries. Also they're specialty cocktails come with double shots, so you get your money's worth (at $13 a pop), but during happy hour they are half off too.  The atmosphere is pretty fun, with all the serves wearing Vans. It has a very modern feel, with lots of exposed metal and lounging areas. The main patio faces Scottsdale Rd, which gives the place a very urban feel, with people walking by. Oh and did I mention it has a second floor?"}
{"text":"Very bad experience here - The bartender tried to overcharge us, then acted like a dick when we called him on it. My dad asked to speak to a manager, but he suspects they grabbed another waiter to come pretend to be the manager. Overpriced and overly-fake-swanky. Stick to local places with good deals"}
{"text":"Ohhhh my goodness what a disappointment. Went here yesterday to grab a bite and enjoy the nice weather. When we showed up we asked for a seat on the patio because its nice outside. There were about 5 tables empty that had not been bused yet, it took the hostess a good 15 minutes to get a table cleaned and get us seated. After that we waited another 15 minutes before our server even came over and asked us for our drink order. It was a little frustrating because the place was a little, busy but not packed. Every time we turned around our waiter was missing, yet everyone else's waiters were taking care of their tables. Finally got drinks, server forgot sweetener for the tea 3 times, 4th time, just stopped asking and drank the tea, food took a while to get out, nothing really special. We ordered 2 burgers and fries. Ordered my burger medium, was pretty well done, my boyfriend ordered his medium rare and was pretty well done. No real taste to the burger itself, the toppings helped some, but not really a great burger for the price! I think by the time the food came, we were irritated just ate and wanted to get out of there. Unfortunately not a memorable place and will not be returning. With this place being around for a while and in Old Town Scottsdale I was expecting a little more. No wonder Rehab burger around the corner had a line out their door (we should have stayed waiting in line over there)"}
{"text":"The food is good, amazing burgers with a variety of creative types.  Good happy hour specials! The real draw is the servers, whoever hires them should get a raise but I'm going to assume it's the owner.  What a group of beautiful, classy ladies who wear tight black outfits!  There are a few that are just shocking!"}
{"text":"i stopped in here a couple weeks ago for lunch.  I was seated right away outside in the direct line of the sun (I came from MN).  I loved it.  I had a chicken caesar salad and a water, not too adventurous or daring but it was great.  It's hard to mess up a caesar salad but it's also hard to make a memorable one.  This one was great!  Everyone working here was friendly, prompt, and had a smile.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.  I'd like to check it out at night and throw a couple back.  Great location!"}
{"text":"In all of the years I lived in Mesa, I only made my first trip to RnR a few months ago. Even when I worked down the street, there was something about the RnR menu that never inspired me to visit. Well, James C. recommended it for brunch when we were all in town and am I glad that he did. They have a great brunch menu and we started with margaritas and the XL cinnamon bun which is no joke. So good and so huge. I had the RnR burger with fries and found everything delicious. We had a good spread of selections at the table and everyone was pleased with their order. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was ok hanging out until the kitchen staff came on their break to hang out at the bar and all blow smoke in our faces while we were trying to eat. Not the kind of place I would be back to but if that's your thing enjoy!  I will say the 2nd floor bar is great but oh yea they close it at 4pm for some reason and move everyone into the overcrowded downstairs."}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious wait times. 2+ hours for a table is ridiculous.  Rude staff. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We attended a private event here on the upstairs patio, which they had rented out. My review pertains to this experience, which included drinks and appetizers. I can not comment on actual meals, or wait service.   The patio itself was cute ,with its own bar upstairs, and the ambiance was lovely at the sunset hour. Everything here is TRENDY and we liked the lollipop chicken, bacon/Ruben melts, and artichoke dip.   The drinks were great and I liked my margaritas a lot. The bartender was friendly and made drinks quickly. I think this woukld be a great area t consider renting out for a rehearsal dinner or work event."}
{"text":"The hangover fries are amazing plus they make a tasty mimosa - not too much orange juice! We sat there for almost 5 hours last weekend, I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"The HH Ahi Tacos are good and a good deal.  The 'tortilla' is a thin rice sheet, which is nice.  However, there are only 4 items on their food HH menu, and it gets old.  However, they are charging $6 for a bottle of O'Douls!  They don't get the MLB Package, so unless a game is on the one MLB channel, you're out of luck.  The bathrooms are stinky and have high school bathroom-type faucets that you have to press down repeatedly to get water.  It's a disconnect from the really nice sink and a pain.  Never seen this place more than 20% full for HH.  They're doing something wrong."}
{"text":"RnR is an awesome experience; hospitable staff, exceptional food. The restaurant's layout creates a fun environment and atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here to have some drinks with my brother and maybe eat a little, walked up to the hostess and was told that there is no seating and that most of the empty tables are reserved, so we asked to sit at a reserved table till the people show up and she said ok, so we sat there with servers passing us and not asking if we wanted drinks or at least water! Since it was like 110 outside, tried to get a drink at the bar but they have seats at the bar and it was packed so trying to squeeze by someone is weird and not cool. So we walked out and went somewhere else where they served us drinks and burgers on the quickness. Smh RnR..."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place! Service is fantastic. Your glass will never be empty for bottomless mimosas. When my food came out, my dish of sweet potato fries wasn't full to the brim, and my waiter brought me a whole other overflowing order without me even asking. I want to be here every Saturday and Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"I've been informed the 3% credit card service charge is no longer in effect. Plus one star from my previous review for that!"}
{"text":"I gave this 2 stars as the food was very good ..but the services was horrible.  Our server was two busy talking to her friends as we sat without refills on drinks and it took 30 min to get our food. We were the 3rd table in the resturant and ordered our food. Table got sat after we ordered with a different server....and got there food before us. I had to ask were ours was.  I also had to ask for the bill after 1.2.hours as she was again chatting with her friends.  I still tipped...but tip over 20 % when not neglected...which I wrote on the recept..not that I think she cared"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weekday after dark awhile back to have some dinner on a Local Dines deal. I requested a patio seat and we were put on the rail near the street. 1st mistake...the traffic from the street was pretty noisy and not really conducive to conversation. 2nd mistake...the lighting on the patio was so dim, I had to hold the menu so the street light would illuminate it. I know, I know, I'm old and can't see as well as I used to but, I still have to eat for goodness sakes! Maybe a candle on the table would have been helpful. I ordered the Ahi Tacos and was warned by the waitress they were very small - no problem, not that hungry and I'm enjoying one or two of their tasty draft beers. The tacos were good but the tuna could have been a little more rare and it was drowned in the sauce which would have also been good in a lesser quantity. My husband got the burger which he enjoyed and ordered the Bacon Brussels as a side. The brussels were the best thing about the experience that evening. From the other reviews, I'm guessing maybe I should have chosen to visit at breakfast on the weekend instead??? Anyway the service was good, the food and drinks were good, just not impressive for the prices. I expect food in Scottsdale to amaze me with all the competition they have near Old Town. If they had breakfast/brunch all day on the weekends I might be able to make it. I just hate getting up early on my days off."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by some friends as a good place to come for drinks and have a bite for brunch.  I can see how this place will be a good spot for some pre-drinking prior to going out.  But the food left me feeling like I would never go back again to have something to eat.  I went with a group of 5.  We had ordered the chicken lollipops for a starter, which was their interesting take on chicken wings.  They weren't bad the ranch was pretty bland but what happened after was what left a bad taste in our mouths.  We had ordered ahi tacos, caesar salad, both versions of french toast and some hash browns.  We waited about 45 minutes to get our food.  Once we got it the hash browns and french toast were made wrong so they had to make the french toast again.  I know they are new and working out all the kinks but then do something about it since it took so long for us to get our food and messed the order up.  The tacos were ok tasting but very small, the salad was typical nothing anybody couldn't make at home and their versions of french toast were just ok at best.  The hash browns were cold and undercooked.  After an experience like that, I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody looking to eat."}
{"text":"Kevin is the best server I've ever had. Seriously. Go to his section if you can because he'll take good care of you. I'll come back here just to see him!  This is a great 49ers bar. Awesome food, great ambience, good prices and always great service. Must try!  Bonus - plenty of great Gluten free options. Try the ahi tacos on jicama \"tortillas\"- delicious!"}
{"text":"3% processing tech fee?  Raise your prices so I can make an educated decision on whether to buy or not.  Don't hit me with some bogus \"fee\" at the end of my experience leaving distaste in customers mouth.  Nickel and dimed right out the door.  In a place that a nickel and dime wouldn't buy you a toothpick."}
{"text":"this place is great! im from out of state and my friend and i where looking for a yummy place to have brunch...low and behold rnr...great food and a reasonable price and the best part bottomless mimosas...fab for vaca..lol  love the fact that the have booths and high bar style table outside. they also had heaters outside which worked perfect for us seeing how it was about 60 degrees outside..lol love this place and will return when im back in az."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go anytime. I've been here for weekend brunch, lunch and dinner. Iv never been disappointed. Amazing food  and great atmosphere. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I love RNR. The bottomless mimosas are always great on a lazy Sunday-Funday. Most of the food I've had there has been really good and the service is pretty quick too. My advice is to arrive early on Sunday, like before 11am. Afterward it gets super busy. Also you can alternate between mimosas and bloody Mary's for bottomless."}
{"text":"Had bottomless mimosas and sun dried tomato scramble. Amazing! It was basically all my favorite things on a plate. Staff was fantastic, Liz and Casey are great bar tenders and quick with service."}
{"text":"While the decor and location are undoubtedly cool & I understand soft openings can be tough, we had a similar experience to Nathan M. on Sunday...very poor service, lackluster food (one sandwich came out 10 minutes before the second one, and even when we pointed this out to our server, she said oh, yeah, the other one is on it's way...when we finally got around to eating the chicken pesto+brie+sundried tomato sandwich -- there was no brie, 1 sundried tomato and a splash of pesto on the bread). And as I looked across Scottsdale Rd. from the patio, I found myself wondering...if a duel broke out between Billet Bar and RnR, I know who I'd put my money on - and it's not the server in the purple & teal vans."}
{"text":"this place has pretty awful service. been here multiple times during sunday fundays, during sporting events, during lazy weekday nights, all types of occasions. generally, you are always left hanging at some point in the meal, either to get your order taken, get your bill, get a drink, something.   on top of that, the food tries really hard but just falls flat. they are going for this whole craft gastropub type thing and nothing really wows. I have had salads, burgers, breakfast items, those Brussel sprouts, its all just like mehhh.  anyways, the reason you go here is for sunday fundays, bottomless mimosas, or sporting events bc the TVs and in that regard this place is a lot of fun and awesome  but can i really give more than 3 stars to a restaurant/bar when the service is terrible and the food is bland? especially when its not dive bar prices?  thus, -1 star for food, -1 for service."}
{"text":"We went for the bottomless mimosas on Sunday and were blown away by the service! Our server Ashley kept the mimosas and the good vibes flowing. She was personable and always respectful of everything we asked for even though she was busy. We would come back for her and the mimosas every weekend!"}
{"text":"Went here for a saturday lunch with a girlfriend. The building is amazing and beautiful, very clean. I'm not generally a \"Scottsdale crowd\" type of gal, but the place was nice, and the music was good too. The menu looked so delicious that we had a hard time deciding what to get. Our waiter was very kind, didn't try to rush us, and gave us plenty of time to decide.   We had a house salad, dirty chips, and an order of sliders. The house salad seemed a bit over priced for what it was, but the dirty chips were really good! The sliders were average, and well priced.  I really want to go back and try a happy hour sometime to try more of the small plates, our only regret was that the order of dirty chips was BIG, we could only finish half of it. A half sized portion would have been perfect, though!"}
{"text":"I took my mom here for her birthday brunch. They have AWESOME bottomless mimosas or bloody Mary's for $15 (with the purchase of an entree). We ordered the breakfast tacos $9, chamboard French toast, the HUGE cinnamon roll (for my son), eggs, biscuits and gravy, etc. It all was GREAT! I highly recommend it! Great patio with garage doors!"}
{"text":"Never thought R n R would be resting and relaxed service. The food was okay as were the beverages. However the service was absolutely horrible--slow, inaccurate orders, and general lack of helpfulness. I will never come back here unless I am dragged by drunk friends and even then I will protest. Thanks for making sure my lunch was lacking in rest and relaxation."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time but the music there on the weekends now is a little much and enough to send me to one of the other many breakfast spots in Old Town. I would go there more if it weren't for the live dj and music blasting... the past few times I've been there it's been so loud my friends and I have to yell to hear each other. But this doesn't keep everyone away, there is usually a wait on the weekends.   They have bottomless mimosas and bloody marys, and an big breakfast menu. The waffles and Vanilla bean pancakes are delicious and served with fruit and apple butter."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the patios, drinks and especially the chicken lollipops.  If you haven't tried them, they are buffalo wings with a handy bone to hold on to while you eat.  The sauce with blue cheese dressy is one for the record books!  I am also a fan that they serve breakfast 7 days a week and have free wifi.  This is a great place to meet for work or meet after a game.  Not too stuffy, but nice enough that it isn't just labeled a bar."}
{"text":"Was here this past weekend & had a great time. The service was great & the food is delicious. I will be back next week for your reverse happy hour. I highly recommend stopping by this place! It's the best"}
{"text":"My husband insists on going here for the Animal Fries... every time we go there the service is consistently sub-par.  This most recent time, beverages took forever, the server didn't know how to properly open a bottle of wine (thank goodness this one server whom I've seen bust his butt a couple times before helped us out) and I got a spotted glass that I ended up polishing myself.   She was nice enough and never ever rude or short-tempered but blonde hair and a short shirt doesn't get a great tip from me.  Prompt service does. We waited quite a long time for our check then to have the check processed and then even longer for a to-go box.  It's ok for me and my hubby but I don't take any out-of-town visitors there.  There are too many other options in that area that appreciate their guests and always are looking for ways to Wow them... in a good way.  These guys \"Wow\" me every time... but in a bad way.  Total time there -  nearly an hour and a half for 2 apps, a kids meal, a bottle of beer and a bottle of wine (that I ended up corking and taking with me).  PS - the cheese plate consists of deli cut cheeses and meats... not impressive either."}
{"text":"RnR is a little different other chill spots in that it comes across as a sports bar for people who only casually watch sports. There are TV screens at every table showing any and every game you could ask for, but there's a DJ spinning mad house while large groups sip on cocktails.   I like the vibes. I like the style. I like the service. The generous apps are easily sharable and very tasty--I recommend fries and nachos alike. I can see why so many folks brunch here!"}
{"text":"I found this place while staying in Old Town for a business trip a few weeks back, I was actually looking for a different restaurant a couple blocks over, but the environment seemed inviting enough to stop in and check out. They had a DJ on the patio playing some pretty decent music and the atmosphere was up beat and casual.  The menu looked to have quite a few options and I decided to go with the Jalapeño Mac 'N Cheese to start, followed by the RnR Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Tots. All of which were pretty solid choices. My second time through I started off with the Pretzel Bites and finished with the Bacon Brussel Burger and a side of Sweet Potato Fries.. I haven't come across anything I don't like, and plan on trying something new every time I visit.  What really kept me coming back was the service. From the hostesses, to the food (chefs), to my server Bianca, I've had a pretty great time all around. Definitely plan on coming back soon."}
{"text":"Came here for the Saints & Lions game a couple days ago w a few friends and I'm glad we did! We got a nice table outside in the patio area where we had the tv right in front of us. It was also happy hour so we got great deals on drinks and appetizers. I recommend the dirty chips... those were really good. Our server was nice and chill. I would definitely come back.. I had an awesome time."}
{"text":"One key element to happy hour is the drink specials. Cheap food is a ++ but drinks are, lets be honest, what it's all about. Don't give me this BS that only well drinks, domestic beer and two kind of wine are $1 off, what is that?   Well you wont find any BS like that at RnR. What drinks are on special you ask.... Basically everything! INCLUDING but not limited to ANY bottle of wine they offer, reserve wine as well. Premium drinks and their specialty cocktails are not included in the half off drink specials, but who cares if you can get a bottle of wine for $18? Done and done! The Gruet Chardonnay is great!   As for the food.... it a little different. First only a few small plates are offered for $5. We got the Dirty Chips (thin house made ships, way good, drenched in sour cream, hot sauce, bacon and tomatoes) and the Baked Brie (neither of which are on special). Both were alright. The chips got soggy in 5 minutes and the brie was a tiny sliver of brie for like $12. I later got the Ahi Tacos..... eh not much to say. The Ahi itself was good, but buyer beware... it doesn't come in a tortilla, its a jicama \"tortilla\"... a bit strange. I will try the sliders next time we are in.   I have to give a special thanks to Sal, he was very nice, helped us find a spot on the patio to migrate to from inside once the sun went down, and gave us the low down on the specials, best nights to come in, whats going on with football season and the facebook hook ups we should take advantage of. We will be back to say whats up to Sal and get some half price wine for sure.  Also, their breakfast menu looks awesome! Update on that to come for sure!"}
{"text":"For starters you MUST ask for Brian Paul to be your server! This guy is a comedian! I've been coming here for a long time and I mean a loooong time and I've never been let down!   2nd the happy hour is on point! YOU MUST ORDER THE STRAWBERRY MARGARITA! Beware, drink two of them and your on top of the world!    3rd everything on the menu is prime!!! Order away!"}
{"text":"A little RnR  This is such a fab chic place to dine breakfast and or lunch. Great ambiance and most importantly great music. I hear Sunday is FUNDAY and I'll be back for it.  What I ordered: ***I ordered the Hangover fries (not pictured because they didn't look nor taste very delicious)  Delicious French Toast!!!!  BEST Red Sangria ever!!!  BEST Watermelon Margarita OMG!!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Not only for the fun atmosphere but also the drinks and the food. Their patio is perfect for people watching, happy hour or watching your favorite sports team. They have a delicious drink menu!!  And their food is so flavorful. I'd like to say there is one thing specifically that I love but I always mix things up. The staff is fun and they love to interact with their tables which makes your experience even better. The management has stopped by our table every time. It's a great place to meet friends or even go on a date!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Top notch service, comfy patio, great music and yummy Animal Fries.  All the servers and bartenders have amaaaaazing customer service.  Special shout out to Brian (seems to always be my server) for delivering the best service I've ever had anywhere.  For a place that seems to draw a lot of beautiful people in, the atmosphere is very non-stuffy and unpretentions.  RnR has found the perfect balance of style, warmth and quality and accented it with amazing staff.    Great HH, too, with half-price taps and cheap appetizers.  I even love the music they have playing in the background, which is rare of me to say."}
{"text":"I had the biscuits and gravy which had a lot flavor. Biscuits where homemade and the sausage gravy had lots of spices. Very nice sports bar with lots of tv's, you can have a conversation since the music isn't that loud, and friendly staff. The also have drink and brunch special for the weekend  ."}
{"text":"Closing manager on 2/7/2015 could have cared less that I decided to leave. I politely informed him that we did place an order , but we'd be leaving. His reply, \"Please do \" I'm sorry but that was enough to have me open a yelp account, just for this review. Why did I leave ? Because after waiting 10 minutes for someone to come over, and getting off my ass to ask for water after no one came over, finally get water, order and ten minutes go by without the waitress coming by to offer drinks we were fed up.  The waitresses here have no sense of urgency and clearly the manager did not care about the guest's experience.  The manager stood there with his arms folded blank stare with no reply but those two words. Sorry RnR but two thumbs down, shame on you for putting someone so careless in charge.  Plain and simple you guys are losing money because your servers are not NEARLY as efficient or politely as they should be, and because management enables this behavior , or at least did tonight.   I will say this \"manager\" did have a towel hanging out of his pocket maybe he was the bartender/ MOD."}
{"text":"I've been to RnR about 4 times total, including on their opening night. Service has always been an issue - their staff seems to care a lot more about socializing and primping themselves than they do about actually waiting on their clientelle. The food is alright, I can't say that there's anything special or memorable about any of their dishes. It's just glammed up bar food - nothing that tastes any better or worse than the 10+ restaurants around Scottsdale that have the exact same concept. The breaking point for me was when I ate a chicken sandwich here one night, and came down with the most awful food poisoning that I've ever experienced. 3 days of excrutiating stomach pain and not being able to keep anything down was the straw that broke the camel's back for me about RnR - I will never return here."}
{"text":"Good food and great atmosphere. Service was OK, our server was very attentive and polite. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw quinoa on their brunch menu- YAY! The only problem I had was lack of plant based milk, I think it wouldn't hurt if they offered soy or almond milk. Otherwise, a place worth a try if you're into sports bars."}
{"text":"Great place. It was my first time in AZ, visiting from CA to see my lady friend. I came specifically for the bottomless mimosas, but had no idea about the DUMBSHIT vertical ID law (huge disappointment!!!) Our server (beautiful woman of color with a bullring in her nose) was sympathetic but firm, and altogether super fun and ebullient. STUPID law, fine restaurant, top-flight service."}
{"text":"Our server (from Flower Mound, Tx) was just a delight to be around. We were there for happy hour and as you can imagine, it was loud and lively. We sat in the patio area and were quickly served both drinks and appetizers. We stopped in for a quick bite and drink before another event, but ended up staying a while and just enjoying the mix of people and the great weather and vibe of the entire place. We had been in RnR for breakfast a number of times, but can see why it is a favorite happy hour place. Excellent service by people who enjoy their work. Keep it up"}
{"text":"The atmosphere can sell its self... Big, open, environment that's tailored towards an AZ type of restaurant. I mean you can't go to many places other than AZ and find an in door/out door restaurant. I wasn't a big fan of the breakfast but the drinks and service was excellent!! If you're looking for a place to drink, watch a game, and hang out with a big group of people this is your place!"}
{"text":"So if you are in Scottsdale and day party/morning party anywhere else then you are doing yourself a disservice. They have amazing/bottomless mimosas and bloody marys so it's the perfect place to go when you are hungover from your Friday or Saturday night festivities and need a drink to nurse your hangover. Their food is also pretty decent but the drinks are definitely where the money's at. Also, Saturday and Sunday mornings are happening, there's a dj and a tonnnnn of people. So, if you are trying to party before 3 pm, this is where you want to be at, trust me"}
{"text":"We came here for brunch, guess I missed the memo about it moonlighting as a nightclub. Lots of beautiful people, short skirts, and a DJ spinning fresh tunes. its a swanky spot with two floors and ample outdoor patios. Girls were bobbing and strutting their stuff at the bar, sure made me feel out of place in my cutoff jeans. Don't get me wrong, there is a chill vibe that permeates throughout, and plenty of hipster shades, shirts and flip flops gracing the premises. To top it off the food wasn't bad and they had $15 bottomless mimosas. if you go, make sure to doll up a bit and dabble on some cologne... and get ready to mingle. Go for the atmosphere, stay for the food."}
{"text":"WE LOVE RNR. Best margs best burgers best service!!!!!!!! 10/10 would recommend.  The margarita was perfectly garnished and the server had the cutest little smile when she served it! She made me believe that I was going to love the margarita before I had even tasted it because she was so enthusiastic about it."}
{"text":"We came in for brunch Saturday morning around 11, and were seated right away. Our service was on point the whole time, with drink refills and appetizer orders. I had the Southwest Burger, and it was amazing! Perfectly cooked, and the pepper jack and chiles were delicious! After eating thousands of burgers all over the U.S., this one was memorable enough to make it into my top 5 ever...was really, really good.  The only reason I can't give it a 5 is the appetizers came out luke warm and seemed like they'd been sitting around for a while.  Will come back again when I'm in town next- cool vibe and great service in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"\"Happiness is finding two olives in your Martini when you're hungry\" Johnny Carson.  Short and sweet ; )  Four ahi tacos 6. HH kicked up a notch.  Seared ahi tuna, citrus spice, fire roasted pico de gallo, guacamole, a slight fistful of daikon sprouts served on jicama tortillas. Botany in cooking at it's best.  Dirty gin martini, three queen olives.  A brilliant neighborhood hang."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick bite, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Very friendly staff, and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"Giving it a one star until I've actually been seated, and get to experience this place. I went for a friend's birthday, and we waited an hour and a half, and never got seated or served. We didn't even get asked if we wanted to wait inside and order drinks.  I understand it was bottomless mimosas Sunday, and it was busy, but I don't understand why they couldn't seat a table of 8 in around 45 minutes. We checked again at an hour and a half, and there were 8 tables in front of us still waiting.  I saw several tables being used by people who were just drinking. I don't understand why they couldn't prioritize clients who were willing to spend on eating and drinking.  Anyways, not worth the wait. Go across the street to Salty Senorita's, save the time and get better service (without the eye rolls from the hostesses).   Also, I'm disappointed this is a Giants bar. I would have returned to watch games here but not anymore. Oh well."}
{"text":"Very impressed. Came at 10, happy hour till close, half off ALL food and drinks. Delicious burger(southwest). Great desserts. Brownie is reasonably sized, soft and warm. Just phenomenal. Warning though. DO NOT BUY CINNAMON BUN UNLESS YOU HAVE 4+ PEOPLE! You won't finish half by yourself or even with a partner. Took picture, just look at that monster. Gonna take it home and enjoy next couple days."}
{"text":"-Traditional bar food, it was nothing special. -Good atmosphere for a sports bar  -Nice outside seating area -Draft Beer was bad as was the White Sangria"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Sunday Funday should always start off with a bottomless mimosa brunch, and RnR is just the spot to do that. For $10, you can get all the mimosas or Bloody Marys your heart desires and your liver can handle from 10am-2pm. Our party of five must have averaged 7 per person. Key word is \"averaged.\" There were two in our group (who shall remain nameless) who probably pounded at least a dozen.  The food was really good! I'm not really sure what the whining is all about from a lot of the other reviewers. I loved my pork hash and maple bacon scone (genius), and my friend's grilled chicken sandwich with pesto, brie and sun dried tomatoes and side of sweet potato tater tots (even more genius) were delish!   Obviously, service was amazing, as our group was never left with an empty champagne glass for long. We had fun being rowdy out on the patio, which is an ideal spot on a nice sunny day.   Happy hour specials (daily 3p-7p and reverse happy hour W-Th 10pm-2am) are awesome. Make sure you follow them on FB as well, as they're always announcing other specials."}
{"text":"This place is absurdly rowdy on Saturdays and Sunday's for bottomless mimosas..... Especially during football seasons. Can be difficult though to order drinks"}
{"text":"Yep... One star! This place is a doozy. I will never come back. The girls and I decided to get together on a Sunday for happy hour. We wanted to go somewhere a little different than our usual, but in the same general area. I thought of this place because a friend of mine used to work there. So we looked on their website to see what time happy hour was. They had one at the right time so we decided to check it out.   We were nicely received, however when our server came to our table she seemed like she was annoyed that she had to help us. We asked what was on the happy hour menu; her response, \"it's Sunday, we don't have happy hour.\" We mentioned that the website said they did, her response \"it's wrong.\" No sorry about that or anything. So despite the let down on happy hour we decided to go ahead and order.   When the food got there we were missing my friends pretzel bites.... No explanation. Our server didn't even check on us and we had to flag someone down to ask about her food about 10 minutes later. It really is a shame the service was so awful, because the food and atmosphere are awesome!! Guess a lot has changed since my friend worked there. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited this morning for my 1st time ever to meet up with some friends for brunch and I was not disappointed! Had a great time with great friends and even greater FOOD!  I had the Kale Ceasar Salad and added Blackened Salmon! The Damon was cooked perfectly and the kale and romaine mix salad was fresh and crispy. The Ceasar dressing is so good I asked for an extra side!   My hubby had the RnR Burger with bacon and cheese and the flavor was full and well seasoned! I love a good burger and this place definitely did not disappoint.   For drinks I had their classic frozen margarita which was perfect consistency with a good amount of \"kick\"!  Definitely would recommend this place for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or just drinks with friends! Sit in the patio and enjoy the views of Old Town Scottsdale. Ask for \"Steve\" he's AMAZING!!! Very attentive and stays on top of his job!"}
{"text":"I have been to RnR several times already, both for drinks and for food.  I must say that when things come out right, they are excellent.  Of course there are improvements that need to be made and kinks that need to be ironed out... that's to be expected, it's the first week they are open.  The limited menu covered the basics, but it said at the top that the full menu would be  available soon.    The appetizers were actually pretty unique, I had these things called Chicken Lolli-Pops which I have never seen before and they were really good.  I also saw Mussels on the menu, which you don't really find around here.    I had breakfast there this morning and the stuffed French toast lived up to it's hype... worth going back for that alone.  The coffee was really good and the mug it was served in is a must see.   The building and architecture was really amazing, and it is a very warm and inviting spot.  I enjoyed the people watching that the patios provided, and the view of Camelback Mountain is unmatched.  I was there during the Spring Training rush, and they were slammed... and there was some room for service improvement during that time, but the energy was so great that it didn't really bother me.   All in all, the place has a great location, great energy, and great food.  I'm going back!"}
{"text":"Today we went for football Sunday to watch The division playoff game between the Packers and the Cowboys. The TV was set to hockey closest to our tables that we reserved and waited for three hours to get which is OK and I have no problem with. However, it was clearly football Sunday. I politely asked for the TV to be changed to football and the hostess said that it was the servers responsibility that they could not do anything. When I asked the server to change it to the football game she asked which game... I told her the playoff game. The whole bar was wearing nothing but Packers and Cowboy gear. Clearly I the manager on duty did not prep his staff for the day ahead or the staff waitresses were not privy to sports working in a sports bar. The waitress literally had no urgency to tend to our needs and I ordered every drink from the bartender at the bar rather than our waitress. Terrible service if that's what they call it."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. The first time ordering food. Great atmosphere that includes a DJ.  I order the grill chicken sandwich with fries and it was just ok. However the peso sauce on the side was the magic touch. Incredible if I could just rate the peso sauce. Decent amount of food. The sauce saved my sandwich.     My boys and I came here bad timing late evening. The hostess recommend's the weekend brunch with the bottomless mimosas now I know next time."}
{"text":"First off we will not be returning. The atmosphere is crappy super loud dance club. Our group had to text each other. Even screaming you can not be heard over the stupid music. Hopefully the food is worth the loud music.  5 star food by far. We had the quaso dip, Rock Shrimp tacos, and the Blue cheese burger. All top quality tasty food. Our waiter was excellent and did his best to take care of us all.   5 Star food vs 1 Star super loud Dance club = 3 Stars over all. Unfortunately due to the extreme music we will not return for the outstanding food."}
{"text":"Really good scene and good food. Went here for a drink and dinner on a recent Friday night and had a great time. The scene is really good, lots of good looking people in their mid 20s - mid 30s. It's definitely a loud place for dinner because there's a DJ and a lot of people hanging around at the bar. I ordered the baked brie and the grilled cheese and both were amazing! (Yes, I clearly have a cheese problem.) Our server was a little clueless but really friendly and nice. The menu has something for everyone which is nice - salads, sandwiches, sliders, tacos, etc. This is definitely a good place to go with a small group before heading out for the night."}
{"text":"RnR has a great ambiance and pretty good bar food.   Seems a bit more upscale for a sports bar but it's not at all stuffy.  They have a really nice outdoor seating area with couches and tall tables and heating if needed.  Drinks are priced pretty average, but they have a really good happy hour.  This will def be a place to return to every year for the Giant's Spring Training."}
{"text":"Only went here for brunch on Sundays but it was awesome.  Bottomless mimosas great for chasing Saturday night's residuals.  Food is really good too, hard to find a party atmosphere like this on Sunday mornings to keep the weekend rolling.  Miss this place."}
{"text":"Not a Gastropub. More of  a double-decker sports bar.  Brunch time service was ok. Food came out cold and pulled pork breakfast hash lacked flavor and seemed like it contained last night's meat. Even the soda was quite watered down.  More of a 20-something late night hang out for drinks/snacks than a meal time establishment."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for a couple weeks about 2 months ago and decided to come here for dinner with a few coworkers one night, what a mistake. The service was horrible and slow, we had to chase down our server for our check and had to wait about 45 minutes for 1 burger and 3 salads, I'm guessing they had to butcher the cow in back or had to wait for the lettuce to grow. The place was not that busy so the fact that we had to wait that long for our food is unacceptable, not to mention we had to wait up front for the hostess to stop talking to her coworkers at the bar to come seat us. The food is way overpriced but in Scottsdale I guess that doesn't matter. It looks like a fun place from the outside but beware once you come in."}
{"text":"Not too often does a bar catch a 5 star from me. This place rocks! Literally ....   Highly suggest the bacon/Brussel Sprouts and the sweet potato tots!  Beer is all good too!"}
{"text":"I have a new favorite dish: Ahi Tacos served on jicama tortillas.   Quick and attentive service for our party of six. A good martini made the way I like it. Interesting architecture.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went to RnR with friends. The food was decent, service was average. If you want to get drunk here you will probably get better service since the bar is always busy. Otherwise, I would say this is a good place to go and get breakfast, lunch, and dinner as long as you don't mind the drunk type around you screaming every few minutes."}
{"text":"I'll say one thing about this place I can always stop in for lunch, grab a pint and order lunch and still get back in time within an hour lunch time. Food was good and the beer was cold. Nice atmosphere during lunch time. Not too quiet and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is a new destination in old town. The atmosphere is hip and ultra-modern, yet remains relaxed and comfortable. We tried this on a Saturday night around 9pm and were lucky to get one of the last booths available. Once seated our waitress was a real trooper - she kept all 5 of us in food and drinks for about two hours (and the place was slammed). They mostly offer small plates and a few select entrees. Food is above average quality, and affordable.   Here's the rub: This is really more of a restaurant than a bar, more about eating/drinking with a group of friends than a date night or party scene. The good news is that when you finish dinner there are dozens of nightlife options in walking distance. Personally I think they should turn the upstairs patio into more of a bar.   *I hear happy hour here is awesome."}
{"text":"Had a Western Burger, Brussel Sprouts with Bacon, Parma Fries and margarita. Perfectly made to order, Amanda made sure I was taken care of checking in on me often. NIce place, open air. I though it would be cold, it was not. I am sure they will be closing things of in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour but is great anytime!  I have made several stops here for happy hour and I have not been disappointed.  Half-off pitchers of sangria is a must!  The Veggie Tacos and Warm Spinach Artichoke are my favorites.  The Sweet Potato fries are an excellent choice too!    I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast too!  You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu.  My favorite is the RnR BYOB Breakfast Burrito and Endless Bloody Marys.    I recommend this place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  This is a fantastic place to start your night off in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Mmmm Bloody Mary with my beautiful lovely girl! And good friends of course!  Food was excellent! Although i felt like i was at a sunday morning rave with all the hipster kids with shiny neon colored shirts, leather coats, and people wearing sunglasses inside. Our server was awesome   Always refilling our mimosas and Bloody Mary . He looked like Sidney Crosby      Was highly entertained by watchin the guy on roller skates dance around  and highly annoyed by constantly getting bumped into by large people with no manners . Try the French toast!!  And dont plan on getting and rest and relaxation on a sunday morning."}
{"text":"This place is bomb and the food is delicious. But the DJ turns up then let's you down real quick. 0-100 and back again. Eff country EDM remixes. 86 them for life."}
{"text":"Located on Scottsdale road just past 1st and featuring a 2-story dining patio plus an industrial chic interior I arrived at RnR just after 8:30 and finding ample parking I made my way in to a sign suggesting I could seat myself - a reasonable proposition that left me any number of 4-6 tops with a great view of the HD-Flatscreens as only one other (very hung-over) party was present - and moments later I was greeted by a young man named Fredrich who would act as my server - and a good one at that considering my substantial capacity for caffeine and nearly two hour stay.  Having already researched the menu online and with $30 to spend per my gift card I spent a few minutes perusing the menu and with the game now tuned in (by request) my order was placed I was left to wait - half studying/half watching the game and fully aware that the restaurant was soon to get quite full and quite loud but perhaps slightly less knowing of just how much food I'd ordered as I sipped a bold and smoky brew simply described as \"Italian Roast\" and fitting that description quite admirably with an ever so slightly 'over-roasted' top note that begged for something sweet - and here, sweetness would come in spades.  Now bearing in mind that Fredrich was the only server I interacted with during the course of my meal I will say here that he could have warned me of what was to come but in all reality I'm kind of glad he didn't because it would have ruined the surprise of the first dish to arrive - a cinnamon roll the size of a hubcap finished off with a gigantic sparkler that simultaneously made me the child in me think awesome while the adult just laughed at the gluttony realizing that there were 4 more dishes to come...and that the whole room was staring at me.  Presentation aside, the cinnamon roll itself was additionally quite excellent; the outside ring suffering from a bit of dryness due to the substantial size but the interior warm, flaky, and easily imbued with a whole stick of butter, a half cup of icing, and multiple tablespoons of cinnamon.  For those wondering, I ate all but the outer ring - and yeah, I could've probably eaten that as well, but the Quails on Main Street looked hungry and I had four more places to eat on the day's agenda.  Moving on to my other options, proving the adage that bigger is not always better the Chambord French Toast would prove to be an excellent dish well worthy of its \"signature\" status with a thick slice of egg bread - think challah without braids or brioche but lighter - split and stuffed with Chambord infused cream cheese and topped with raspberries, Gran Marnier, and light crème Chantilly.  Still a large dish, but far less so than the cinnamon roll the French Toast was a practice in subtleties as each constituent was present, pleasant, and balanced without overwhelming the others...and proving my little sister's theory correct once again, a bit of maple syrup certainly didn't hurt.  For the last item I'd eat during my stay, a single vanilla bean pancake with apple butter would prove to be sole lowlight of the morning as the cake itself was dense rather than fluffy and largely lacking in vanilla flavor, though the apple butter and seasonal berries were quite nice.  Noting here that I would have been more than contented to leave RnR with a favorable impression at this point, with a $30 certificate to spend and the Buckeyes to watch I stuck around sipping coffee for quite some time while picking at the cinnamon roll and once The Ohio State University had assured a win I picked up two items to go - a chocolate chip muffin and maple bacon scone - both baked in house, served warm, and very nicely done with the scone soft and subtle while the muffin was slightly toothsome and studded with dark chocolate...they went great with a cup of coffee later on at Cartel and solidified RnR as a place I'd definitely return for brunch or perhaps dessert to check out the carrot cake (and maybe a second go at the Cinnamon Roll.)"}
{"text":"It looks really cute from the outside. The view is cool. But the service sucked. We were here for over an hour an a half and only had 1 drink, not b/c that's all we wanted, but b/c our server never came around. And the place was probably only 30% full. Also it's pretty pricey...I understand it's Scottsdale, but a cup full of the worlds smallest wings shouldn't cost as much as an entree! For the price and lack of service, you could do better almost anywhere else."}
{"text":"I can see why this place isn't for everyone and why the rating isn't higher.  If you are older than 40 and are coming here just to eat it may not be the ideal place.  With that said, my friends and I tried several of the dishes and EVERYTHING we had was amazing (chicken tacos and bacon Brussels sprouts were probably the best).  Maybe we were lucky, but it was delicious.   I came on a Sunday and it was pretty much like a Vegas pool party atmosphere with all you can drink mimosas.  It was a little overwhelming at first but it would be a really fun place to chill on a Sunday when you feel like having a good time.  I can't wait to come back when I'm in the mood to party."}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for business and decided to check out RnR. The food was good, but what really made the experience was our server Erika R. Erika was super friendly and very attentive. Most restaurants have good food, but it's people like Erika that make it worth coming back."}
{"text":"Had a great Father's Day early dinner/late lunch at RnR yesterday.  Nice place, the small plates were all excellent.  Chicken lollipops - really good. Mussels were very good. Seared ahi salad, very good. Animal fries - sinful.  A bit spendy, but you get what you pay for.  Friendly service.  Casey, Junior, Kip were great hosts.  Good wine list, good drinks.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I know people that love this place but I am not sure what all the hubbub is about.  I came here on a Friday night around 9pm.  It was pretty dead. The music was super loud, drinks were weak and over priced, and there were TVs every inch of the place, with sports, yuck."}
{"text":"First time at RnR that I've heard such good things about. First off our drink orders took about 15 minutes, which fine whatever. We order our food and 2 appetizers were missing after waiting 40+ min. She barely said sorry and finally got the appetizers after food was eaten. Our eggs were ice cold. No fault was taken and most companies would comp it. My tab had the drink an extra charge of 1.25 which I honestly don't care but when I asked she said idk it's a frozen margarita it's not a big deal it's a dollar. I would prefer not to be over charged and not explained why with attitude. Overall wouldn't recommend for okay food and horrible service."}
{"text":"They don't have places like this is in San Diego. Good food, good drinks, good music, and a great party scene.   4 stars because had to wait an hour for my group to be seated. But there is a reason this place is packed all the time.. It is good!!"}
{"text":"RNR has the best salmon is town! You have to try it. Not to mention after 10pm the whole menu is 50% off! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"First off, I'd probably put this at a 3.5 if possible. A lady friend and I went here this morning (Sunday) for brunch after a wild night of cosmic bingo at the casino. We ordered the egg whites with turkey sausage, a maple bacon scone, mimosas (which are never ending from 11-3pm on Sundays for around $7 - i only had two though so maybe they took that into consideration?) and coffee. All of the food was really good, and everything that passed us by looked awesome as well, we wanted to try everything!  So the reasons it got knocked some stars down: 1. Our server was miserable. No smile, no hustle and bustle, nothing other than \"What would you like?\" \"Are you ready to order\" and the rare \"Can i get you anything?\" We had empty water glasses at the edge of our table, no offer to refill it, we had to ask. Didn't ask us if we would like cream or sugar with our coffee - had to ask. Also our eggs came with toast but there was no butter/jam on the side for it- again had to ask. Granted it's the little things but in the service industry those are the things that matter most, and all I'm really looking for. If you're not into it, please get a new job. All the other servers seemed pleasant and attentive though, we just got a dud i think.  2. The music was SO loud. The DJ who was playing was decent & maybe im getting old but i felt like i had to wear ear plugs, and could barely hear my friend who was sitting, at most, 3 feet away. We both felt like we were yelling to have a conversation. And our baby headache hangovers were super not happy with it either. And please take into consideration we're the type of girls who love going to festivals - punk rock ones included.  3. We were sat on the upstairs patio (awesome views btw), where there were heaters,  but we both felt like they were not well placed, and today it was chiiiillly! It would have been nice to have been by a heater.   With all of this, we definitely will be back. Their Happy Hour specials look rad and i definitely want to try more of their food selection."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE! Too bad I can't give zero stars. First time eating at this establishment. We had a reservation for a party of 10. (Emphasis on \"party of 10\"). We showed up, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to seat us at our table...the only problem was that the table only seated 6 ! We explained to the server and hostess that we had a reservation for a party of 10...NOT 6! They looked at us with a confused, puzzled, \"deer in the headlights\" look. I suggested (trying to help them implement some rudimentary, simple creative problem solving) that they provide us a few more chairs from all of the empty chairs in one area of the restaurant. The \"deer in the headlights hostess\" then responded by saying, \"...oh, we can't take any of those chairs, those are for a reservation.\" I then said, \"...WE HAVE A RESERVATION AS WELL...for a party of 10!\" She then responded, \"...yeah, but their reservation is for a party of 21.\"  WTH? I then had to help them formulate the next simple creative problem solving step in this process by suggesting that they get a table and chairs from outside and add those to our area so that we can accommodate 10 people. They responded, yeah...that's a good idea! They then brought over a table which was about as sturdy as a table sitting on a bowling ball. It rocked and wobbled all over the place. We had to work to prevent our drinks from spilling. Did they offer to fix it you may ask? Why, of course not! They simply dropped the wobbly table on the floor and walked away. But wait...there's much more. I then had to tell the server to wipe off the tables, which were covered with a sticky residue of some sort (which I happened to lay my arm on it). I guess they don't care about wiping off tables and chairs before seating guests. Ok...now to more incompetence. We were assigned a new server. She immediately proclaimed that \"tonight is my first night.\" in my opinion, it appeared that it was the first night for all of the employees. One bright spot was that the food tasted good. Fast forward to the end of our \"experience at RNR.\" Our server showed up to collect all of our credit / debit cards. She then disappeared to run the payments. She then returned all of our cards...only to come back again and ask for our cards a second time. Seems that she \"made a mistake\" the first time. She said the payments didn't go through. We all gave her our credit cards again. Later that evening all of us in our party noticed that RNR ran our payments TWICE! One of the couples in our group (who should have only had a bill of $45) was charged over $170!!! Not only did the server charge them twice, she charged them for somebody else's ticket! I called the Manager at RNR on Monday and also today (Tuesday) and explained what happened. He offered NO apology (yesterday or today's phone call) for the terrible service, NO acknowledgment. Seriously?? Not even one apology for the myriad screw-ups? Unbelievable!! All of us in our party have had to file claims with our banks to have them reverse the charges. The superfluous charges STILL have not been reversed, as the banks have said it can take up to 10 biz days! Apparently, RNR Gastropub needs to hold some serious remedial customer service training, and hire some \"semi-intelligent\" people who are capable of some semblance of analytical thinking, and creative problem solving. Needless to say, we will definitely NOT be going back there again. You can get better service at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Come here quite often when I stay in Scottsdale.  Tonight was quite a disappointment. When the bartender handed me the menu he mentioned that it was reverse happy hour. Ordered the sliders off the happy hour menu as usual. I received three charcoal briquettes on buns.  Not very good but it was half price - until I received my bill. Sorry - no happy hour tonight was the response when i asked about the bill. I mentioned that his bartender told me that it it was happy hour and his response was too bad. Beer selection is below average lately and food quality is declining. Too many other great options around to put up with this. Last bisit to R n R."}
{"text":"Standard bar in the middle of Scottdale. Beer flights are a nice touch, but the music was simply too loud to carry a conversation."}
{"text":"What can I say about RnR?   It's every 20-27 year olds dream for a way to unwind on the weekend. $15 dollar bottomless mimosas on weekends between 10AM and 3PM- its definitely a steal.   The music is amazing (live DJ) - they put on whatever you want on TV and its just a good place to go with a few friends or a big group.   You'll see people wearing Sunday Funday tanks and it really takes on the persona of Scottsdale on a weekend.   The food could get better though- the selection is good, the execution is poor.   Place is for day raging only- not really good at night"}
{"text":"Meh, I don't know how I feel about this place.   I REALLY wanted to love it, but I just didn't. I think I might have to go back and try it again, I have a feeling it would be a great Sunday brunch spot after a heavy hitting night of partying in Oldtown. I know they have mimosa specials, too, which won't hurt.   I went here on a Sunday afternoon to do some trip planning with friends. I will just give you my pros and cons in a list because, well, I'm feeling lazy today and not very eloquent.   Pros:  Sweet potato fries were delish  Pretty extensive wine list  Drink specials for a few things early in the day or at happy hour  Ahi tacos that were very yummy on jicama \"tortilla\"  Pretty crowd  Great building/venue  Breakfast menu looked awesome   Cons:  Server was just kind of blah, not too friendly  Food came out at different times  Drinks that are not on special are pretty pricey  Not as many selections for other meals besides breakfast, mostly sandwiches, etc; nothing stood out as spectacular.   So, as you can tell, my experience wasn't bad enough to keep me away, but it also wasn't great. I think I will give it another go, mostly because their Chambord Pancakes sound AMAZING.   So for now, let's consider this part 1 of 2. I'll be back...."}
{"text":"Love this place! Came here while out here for Giants spring training, . Great HH, must have their margaritas. Don't be surprised by the small glass because they do their job. Ordered the sliders, dirty fries (wish I got a pic of it! it's topped with 2 eggs), jalapeno mac n cheese, and their gigantic cinnamon roll that the 3 of us didn't even finish. It was more of a spur of the drunk moment order.  This place is a must if you're in the area. Definitely going back on future trips!"}
{"text":"The RnR restaurant was the perfect atmosphere in the early morning for our business meeting. The staff was great, and our server Elatish was perfect. She made us feel welcomed and really captured the essence of what customer service is all about. The French Toast I ordered was great too! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"I've got one word... Margaritas! A bunch of girlfriends and I came here for some day drinking on vacation to Scottsdale. We absolutely loved the happy hour (I'm pretty sure we tried everything on the menu) and the service was friendly and fast. If you're looking for some good day drinking while on vacation or a day off this is a great venue to do it! They also bring birthday cake with a sparkler :)."}
{"text":"I really wish I would have found this place earlier. I have to say it's my new favorite bar. Our first visit was on a Thursday early morning, the place was pretty quiet. We sat at a table on the patio. It seemed really laid back and casual, the service wasn't too quick. The food was good, but my boyfriends orange juice was rancid. They are supposed to have fresh orange juice so I don't know if it was from a different day or what, but it was pretty gross. I felt bad that my boyfriend actually took a drink from it. And at the same time was super relieved I went with coffee that morning or I would never have gone back. Needless to say we weren't too impressed with the place but thought we'd give it a second chance. The next time we went, we sat at the bar and had a great time. The bartender gave great service and made great food recommendations. We got the bbq pork sliders, which are amazing and their sweet potato tots. We tried it out again for breakfast and I even dared to order the bottomless mimosa (after the OJ nightmare the first time) and they were good. Although, from a bartenders perspective, I recommend to drink at least 5 to get your moneys worth. All the food we've ordered has been pretty good, because of the plates it seems like small portions but they are actually decent sized. Now every time we've been there has been the same. Great atmosphere, love both the patios, good service, and good food."}
{"text":"We came here for a happy hour and I definitely left happy. I had sweet tea vodka and lemonade cocktails at $4 each.  A very nice price for the tall drink. We also tried the chicken wings and spinach dip.  Both tasty.  The wings were so good.  Lollipop style with the right amount of spice. The interior was open with high ceilings and an industrial feel.  The staff were all friendly.  I would like to go back and try some of their entrees."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very fun place to go any day of the week. I went here on a Sunday for brunch and by the time I left around noon it had turned into a huge party at the down stairs bar. It's a very energetic place to hangout!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the bottomless mimosas at RnR are definitely bottomless. I certainly had my fill..and then some. I visited for the first time for Sunday brunch and can see why my friends frequent regularly. There was a live DJ who played a great mix of current music with some older classics. I wasn't wowed by the entree I chose (breakfast tacos) but the dessert brownie and ice cream really hit the spot. We had a great waitress (Courtney) and also found the crowd to be lively and fun without being obnoxious which is sometimes hard to balance. Look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I go back and forth between 3 and 4 stars for RnR in Scottsdale.  Over the summer, they had a phenominal bottomless mimosa special...$10 for unlimited mimosas from open until 2pm on Saturdays and Sundays.  But now that it's football season, and they aren't quite as new, they've upped the prices.  $15 bottomless mimosa special - here's the catch - with the purchase of an entree.  Now, I will say that they aren't ALWAYS super strict about that catch, and sometimes as long as one person at the table orders, they consider it good enough.    Their food is pretty good, although one of my friends complained that almost every dish came with bacon, which she found gross.  She even ordered a bloody mary that had a slice of crispy bacon stuck in it (ewww) As someone who loves bacon, tho, I don't mind.  The prices for the food are pretty steep in my opinion.  My favorite is their absolutely AMAZING baked mac N cheese dish (with spicy pepperjack cheese and bread crumbs on top) for only $5 (portion is small).  Anyone who has read some of my other reviews knows that a good mac N cheese dish qualifies a whole extra star all on its own.  Another quick tip - if you 'friend' RnR on facebook, you will recieve daily 'code phrases' that will provide excellent discounts for the alloted timefram (usually 1/2 off wine or martinis, or hh specials all night long) if whispered to your server.  Overall, good food, decent service, kinda spendy, but fun.  Oh, and their upstairs patio is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is simply confusing! And not in a good way. It's a nice place but it does not define itself at all. The menu includes breakfasr items but no lunch items and it does not have typical bar food either. No chicken wings yet there are tvs all over the place setting up the place to be a typical bar. It tries to be a wine bar but the wine list is very limited. We ordered the ordinary nachos which were decent and I also had the grilled  chicken sandwich which I ended up just eating the  chicken breast.  we went on a weekday so it might be different on the weekend but if u want a wine bar or a regular bar or a place to have a nice meal there are better options. the owners need to figure out what their concept is because it just left us confused and frustrated."}
{"text":"I went to this beautiful building with Great expectations but WOW what a disappointment. I sat at the upstairs bar and ordered a beer great except a little high price. after 30 minutes I asked for a menu after the shuffle to find one and then explain the items they were out of I ordered the RNR burger and waited 52 minutes and it was cold as my beer the bartender said OK we will not charge you for it Really? I paid cash for my 2 beers but they took a credit card to run a tab it took 4 days to clear the pending at my bank. just a bad deal"}
{"text":"Looking around the area for a place to grab some brunch we came across this spot. It is two levels and seemed really busy so we thought why not?  Espresso based drinks: Don't bother here. It tastes like it came from one of those push button deals. Just not worth the money.  Brunch: Sorta bland and middle of the road. I got the breakfast sammy and added avocado to it. It was OK but really small and lacking in flavor. I will say they gave a me a ton of avocado so good on them for that.  Service: We were upstairs and the service was pretty bad. Our waitress was nice but we found out drinks empty a lot and just felt overall that we should have been checked in on.  I know people rave about the brunch and bottomless champagne here but other spots have better deals and I saw that the mimosas were small and full of oj. I guess if you are in a larger group and get attention it is worth it, otherwise I would hit somewhere else up.  It its favor this spot does have a lot of people, and looks good for groups. I just like better food with my drinks."}
{"text":"RnR is a decent spot for happy hour in Old Town. I met a friend there a couple weeks ago. It was full, but we were able to get a table quickly. Our server was very attentive and fast. We each ordered margaritas - I got one with chambord and my friend got a strawberry margarita. Upon first sip I couldn't understand the TWO drink limit in such a small margarita, but as I had more, I really could taste the alcohol. A little strong for me, but overall fairly tasty.   We each ordered sandwiches. She got a chicken, brie, sundried tomato sandwich... I was envious of it, but I don't eat chicken so I ordered the veggie sandwich. A decent sandwich, but nothing to write home about. I'd probably try something else next time. We shared the sweet potato fries and parmesan chips... both very good! We were surprised at the generous portions of each too.   The outdoor patio is right up on Scottsdale Rd and is across from the Billet Bar which made for a ton of motorcycle and traffic noise. Kind of annoying at times, but I could deal with it.   I read a few reviews about it being pricey. Go for happy hour... much better prices."}
{"text":"What a great place.  The service was outstanding. The food was original. We had the Ahi Tacos with Hicama  shells.  Very original. The Ahi was fresh.  The happy hour menu was good and atmosphere was nice.  Highly recommend checking it out.  Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Well we went on opening weekend and went very late.  I was hoping for breakfast around 11pm.  Despite advertising that they were open and doing regular business, when we got there and got seated, the waiter told us that it was a limited menu.  No big deal, I get it, but lame.  So we order a couple drinks, some mini hot dogs, and a burger to share.  The drinks were a DISASTER.  I don't think I've ever had a worse drink.  $13 for a tiny glass of vodka and muddled fruit.  No flavor, no sugar, no nothing.  Just straight vodka and fruit.  This is the most expensive drink I've ever seen on a menu and it is worthless.  I can get a damn flaming volcano of rum that has enough booze to knock two of me out for $15 at Hulas...so explain your pricing scheme to me - please.  The mini hot dog things were good.  Nothing special about them, but they were okay.  The burger was giant and pretty good.  It had some massive pieces of bacon on it and was cooked really well.  I am still willing to go back for breakfast one of these days but for the $40 a dropped there, I really didn't get much out of it.  The service was painfully slow and the menu was overpriced.  Welcome to Scottsdale, I guess."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the open indoor/outdoor floor plan. It was a beautiful day for brunch and afternoon hangs. The staff was super helpful when we couldn't choose what we wanted. They made sure we knew it was almost happy hour and tried to keep up in the loop with the deals. Their mules are pretty delicious and they were pretty heavy handed.   I definitely see why this is a talked about popular spot. Once I experienced brunch and the food, I may add that extra star. For sure would like to come back for brunch."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere= great patio! Breakfast and mimosa's are great too! Some times you dont see your server for extended periods."}
{"text":"WTH happened to this place!!! RnR use to be my all time favorite place... I recently came to RnR about 3 times in the last month after a hiatus from the bar scene and each time it just kept getting worse. The food is definitely not what it use to be, the drinks taste horrible, they don't have frozen margaritas, their award winning bloody Marys taste like sewer water and the service is non-existing!!! Management is also ridiculous, when we asked to talk to the GM he was so aggressive and definitely should not be managing a place... It's so bad that even our server was bad mouthing the manager Dakota to us... Also WTH happened to the staff they all look like trailer trash now. I also couldn't believe what I witnessed at the door literally some new dress code AKA racism(I've been coming here since this place opened and this dress code was never a thing)... R.I.P RnR, I wish we could go back sometime before the superbowl a few years back... when the staff was hot and friendly, the service was excellent and entertaining and the food was killer."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a group of friends for Happy Hour after a baseball game at Giants spring training stadium.  We were seated promptly and told about the happy hour specials.  Our server even told us about the frozen margarita's having more alcohol than the ones on the rocks so we went with those :).  For food we just snacked on the Chicken lollipops which were great good flavor and a nice spice to the sauce.  Also we got the ahi tuna tacos which I thought were awesome.  They had great flavor and you got 5 per plate.  They were cold and the jimica taco shell was a nice crunch and change from the usual taco.  Overall with happy hour prices we left very happy and enjoyed our food and didn't get a major hit in the wallet."}
{"text":"checked out this place for happy hour so technically i felt it wouldn't be right to give any more than three stars based on my visit which did not include me testing any main dishes( if/when i do , i will then adjust accordingly. ) alrighty then on to the review shall we? i admit i really do dig the architecture of this place, and our waitress was awesome. seems like this place is a place for singles to go for happy hour. our waitress even made a joke about her area was the couples corner, and it really was, us and two other couples. So with that said if your single, this might be a good place to go with a couple friends for some drinks. there is indoor/outdoor seating and tv's outside as well. there is also a second floor as well with outside seating too.   Food: Dirty nachos were bomb!!! so effin good, highly recommend getting your hands on some of those delicious bastards. also had an order of lollipops(chicken cut and prepared so it sits on top of the bone like a lollipop) they had really creative names for everything, all of their apps looked appetizing to be honest. and a +,everything came out super quick.  Drinks: pricey yes. $13 for a martini. i thought o.k jess this can go either way, can be the best damn martini , or you will get suckered and pay for something that you could get for $3 at Applebees. in the end i was in the middle of these two outcomes. Martinis were pretty good, the Overcast is worth trying, again they have really creative names for everything which i love.   overall good experience, worth giving them a try and see whatcha think!"}
{"text":"Like all bars in Scottsdale during Spring Training, they cater to SF Giants fans.  Nice upscale sports bar atmosphere inside, a slightly bit more relaxed yet very energetic outside patio area.    Service is friendly, bar bites are decent, but it would probably behoove you to go during happy hour in order to get the best deal for your money for the quality (food and drink) that you receive."}
{"text":"Service was poor and food came out at all different times. I had flown in some clients and their wives. We went out to one of Evening Entertainment Group's clubs in Old Town and to RnR the next morning. One of the meals didn't even come out until after everyone else had finished. It was breakfast time, nothing special that should have caused such a horrible delay. No manager ever asked how our visit was or if there was anything that could be done. Typical management at EEG I guess; no concern for their customers.   \"WARNING: DUE TO REPEATED, SEVERE, AND/OR NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS NOTED ON THIS INSPECTION LEGAL ACTION IS BEING INITIATED.

{"text":"Located in old town Scottsdale, stumbled on this place after a San Francisco Giants game. Place is amazing, incredible beer selection on tab, great choices of craft beers. The food selection goes hand in hand with the ambiance, definitely order the animal fries, they speak for themselves. It's a place to visit of in old town Scottsdale. Service and staff is beyond incredible."}
{"text":"This is my first time and I am currently at the establishment with my one of my friends and we chose the outside bar for lunch . We are both fellow bartenders and she asked politely to a couple if they could move down one seat so we could have a seat together. We didn't think there was a problem but the female bartender (she never told us her name) shook her head and rolled her eyes when we sat. Then proceeded to tell my friend she was rude for asking them to move down a seat. Then ignored us for ten minutes before coming back over... Nice place to enjoy my day off. As a fellow bartender, I don't see what was wrong with asking them to move. I have seen it numerous times at my bar and have never acted that way. It is very off-putting. But, I will say that the bar manager did apologize."}
{"text":"We went to RnR for brunch on Sunday at 215 pm (brunch ends at 3 pm) and were told it was $5 for ladies & $10 for men to enter. I asked the bouncer \"we have to pay to enter even to just eat?\"....he looks around first and says yes, plus the wait is long to eat, good luck. I have never been to place that charges an entry fee at the door to eat at their establishment during their brunch hours. The bouncer obviously was trying to pocket a few dollars. I asked my friend who recommended the place and she said she never had to pay to enter during brunch hours. Clearly it was discrimination. I will never be going back."}
{"text":"Every time that my family comes into town we make sure to start our Sunday's off at RNR.   Great place to start off your Sunday Funday with friends and family alike.  We order a couple of entrees for the table to share and then get bottomless bloody's and mimosa's.   All I have to say is that their bloody mary's come with a piece of bacon in it, do I need to say anything else.  Food is fantastic, drinks keep coming, and the environment is amazing.  SUGGESTION If you are going with a group try to go early. Once this place fills up on a Sunday it is near impossible to get a table until around 1 or 2."}
{"text":"The food was good; however, the table was so sticky and dirty we had to ask our server to wipe it off for us. It didn't help the problem....the menus, table, even the check folder were all sticky. Tons of napkin residue left on the table. This place could use a good deep clean!!"}
{"text":"We ate at RnR while visiting Scottsdale, and it was okay.  Nothing great, nothing terrible.  The service wasn't great, anytime we needed anything (i.e. water refills, napkins, condiments) we had to flag someone down, which took awhile.  The food was alright, we just shared the slider trio and fries.  The sweet potato fries were good, parmesan fries not so much- they are bland fries with parmesan powder poured on them, not very good at all.  The sliders were okay, again, nothing special.  Although nothing was terrible, I probably wouldn't return with all of the other great dining options in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Such a fun place to go for brunch after a night of drinking in Scottsdale.  Obviously the Bottomless Mimosas and Bloody Mary's are the best deal in town and the food is fun and hearty enough to soak up all that alcohol.    Our server Mandy was fun, spunky and literally never let our drinks get to half empty.    The place itself is very hip, cool and modern western.    Music is loud and fun.    Overall a great place to go for the young and fun.    and more than deserving of the current 3 stars."}
{"text":"Probably slowest service we have experienced in a long time.  Server kept reassuring us on our food would be up \"shortly.  food was unimpressive.  appetizer was Buffalo sauce tossed on some chips.  Chicken tacos were burnt.  not a bad place to go the if you want to hang out and watch sports.  just don't come hungry."}
{"text":"This place is just okay for me. I am not the kind of person who likes loud bars, loud music, and it's extremely packed. The bathrooms where also a huge mess. Maybe I've came at a bad day (aka spring training)... But again, not my cup of tea. I've had their ahi tacos and was hoping to get a real size taco and not a few very small tacos with no tortilla. Unfortunately, I will not be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"RnR I tried to like you, I really did.  I've lived in Scottsdale for a few years now so I am used to the restaurant/night club/trendy spot but I just couldn't get into RnR.  I've been there for dinner several times and didn't enjoy myself.  The place is loud, the food mediocre and the service ranges from good to plain awful.  Nothing on the menu ever really grabbed my attention so I had the Rock shrimp appetizer and a side of Parmesan fries.  My two dinner-mates each ordered a sandwich with fries as well.  My rock shrimp were ok, nothing to write home about and my side of $6 fries was tiny.  My friend's side of fries on their sandwiches was a larger portion than the side I paid extra for.    Before I wrote the place off, I wanted to stop by for breakfast since I had heard about their endless mimosa and blood mary special.  The special is a little confusing, if you aren't ordering a breakfast entrée it $25 but if you do order an entrée it is $15.  Our server was busy that morning but also was very spaced out.  Forgot to bring our joiner a water or silverware and was very non-existent.  The place was a little busy so I wanted to cut him some slack but he never wrote down our orders and then would come back to clarify on what we had ordered because he forgot.  The endless special seemed like a good deal until I realized they didn't make each refill on your mimosa but came around with a pitcher of pre mixed mimosas so some tasted like just OJ and some like a weak mimosa.  My friend who had the endless bloody enjoyed his deal, each bloody was a little different made each time (once with a slice of bacon, once with bacon bits, once with no bacon at all) but all in all thought it was a good for the price.  My $3 cup of coffee was not refilled, even when I requested.  The food on the menu was a different story.  I ordered the 3 breakfast tacos and requested a side of hash browns instead of home fries.  Our waiter didn't write down my order so of course it arrived with home fries but the food runner was happy to bring me the side of hash browns.  My friends enjoyed their build your own burritos but my food was subpar.  My tacos were greasy and lacked flavor.  Every time I picked up my taco for a bite, grease ran out the bottom.  Even my potato and egg taco was greasy and flavorless.  The hash browns were soggy and covered in cooking grease as well.  I'm all for a greasy spoon hang over breakfast but this was over board.  The server was happy to oblige our request for separate checks but again because he failed to write down our order, all our checks were wrong but by this time we were ready to leave so we paid what he gave us and left.    The people watching WAS amazing.  It was noon on a Sunday and there were girls in full make up and going out clothes (not walk of shame either) and d-bags galore.  If I wanted to start a drinking game at RnR it would be drink when ever some dude in a plaid shirt high fives another dude."}
{"text":"Had such a fantastic time at R&R for my birthday brunch!!! They were able to save a table for our large-ish group even though they don't usually do reservations. I really appreciated the accommodation and helpfulness!  I didn't know anything about the bar before we got there, and I was pleasantly surprised by the very upbeat, open-air atmosphere. It was a Sunday morning and it was pretty packed, with most people there watching football on the big screen tvs.   Everything on the menu sounded delicious, and I had a tough time deciding! I went with the pulled pork scramble, which was a little dry, but still delicious. My friend had some killer french toast too! And the tacos looked amazing. The best part was the $20 bottomless mimosas and Bloody Marys. Our waitress was AWESOME and I don't think I ever saw the level of my glass go down, because she was constantly refilling it. For bottomless drinks, they tasted really really delicious!   Over all, this was one of the most fun, delicious, memorable birthday experiences I've had in a while! Big thank you to everyone at R&R for making it great!"}
{"text":"Ehhh. Food was okay. None of us were really impressed with our meal. It was overpriced for what it was. The atmosphere was trendy, but it didn't make up for the fact that my sandwich tasted like crap. The drinks are expensive. My sangria tasted like a newbie attempted to make it. Ugh. This place is LOUD. Good luck having a conversation at a normal level. At least we looked cool sitting in the booth...but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"I live a half mile from this place and always avoided it because I thought it was a young hipster joint (sadly, I'm way past that phase). However I've been there twice recently to watch early evening college football games and I've been pleasantly surprised. Great service, great happy hour food, and great atmosphere. Very attentive, friendly servers, both at bar and table (shout out to Della and Kendall). Also had seriously the best burger of my life. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Bartenders are very nice and helpful with knowledge about alcohol. Every time I come here I know I'll be taking care of very well. Bartender Noelle is absolutely amazing! Not sure what the other reviews regarding the food being \"bad\" or \"cheap\" is all about. It's a sports bar.. If you want fine dining go to a steak house."}
{"text":"IF ASHTON, TROY or DANIEL are working... You will love everything about your visit! YOU THE REAL MVP! When people are passionate about communicating with others, you know you've hit a gold mine.The beer menu is great, the food is amazing and I really cant think of anything negative to say about this place. My go-to spot in Scottsdale. Especially on weekdays, cause weekends can get a little too crazy for me. Haha"}
{"text":"My first visit to RnR was mediocre to say it best. Our food was actually pretty decent, but the lack of attentiveness from our wait staff was disturbing. Our waitress never introduced herself, she just literally propped her breasts up on our table and said \"what do you want?\". Neither of us were impressed. Not to mention there was a small group of bikers that were eyeing us hard. Since we are an interracial couple, this was a very uncomfortable situation. Not really sure what type of vibe this place is going for. Somewhere between a frat house and a motorcycle club I guess. Our server was completely overwhelmed by her three tables and her cellphone. All of the wait staff was distracted by scrolling thru social media and texting, to notice they forgot to place my boyfriends entree order. You could tell who the manager was bec as soon as she walked by, the staff scrambled to hide their phones. Once we reminded our waitress about the missing entree, it was out fast and tasty! My ahi tacos were fresh and light and are the only reason I'm giving this place any stars at all. It's clear the BOH has it together, but the FOH would rather be on IG and FB than earning tips and loyal customers. And this was during a post lunch afternoon. I can't imagine how much of a shitshow it's like during the weekends! Thankfully this one visit to RnR was enough to realize I can do without this place. Tasty food AND excellent service can be found elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have been there before, but am reviewing my most recent stop on a Saturday morning.  I ate some amazing food!  A bloody mary is considered \"food,\" right?  And like most of the other bar/restaurants around Old Town, it can get busy... but that's why you go to a lot of those places... or maybe I am the only one who likes a crowd?  At least it's a pretty attractive crowd.    Also enjoyed the Hangover Fries quite a bit... although I swear I wasn't hungover.  That much.  And I assume before naming these Hangover Fries, they also considered calling them Blocked Arteries Leading to a Massive Heart Attack Fries... but that name was probably too long to fit on the menu.  Anyway, you should probably share these with someone.   We sat outside and the sun was getting pretty hot, so the server (or bartender?) lowered the sunscreen for us.  Can't beat that for quality service!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a few drinks and food. Great service and a nice place to meet up with friends for a night out"}
{"text":"Best place for Sunday Brunch if you're looking for an upbeat atmosphere. Can't beat the Bottomless mimosas and bloodys."}
{"text":"I've been into RnR several times for brunch on the weekends. Service is always surprisingly quick and efficient, even when it's standing room only in there.  The downfall -- for me -- is that they have a live DJ during the day Saturdays and Sundays. I think they usually start that around noon or 1pm. Some may love that daytime club scene at a restaurant. I think it's obnoxious. So if you want a more chill environment, go earlier in the day.  $15 bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's on the weekends. Can't go wrong there."}
{"text":"I was denied entry for wearing sweatpants on 12/4 roughly before noon.   I saw other people in the establishment wearing close to, if not the same relaxed comfortable clothing I was wearing.  1. This is a bar, not a fancy 5 star restaurant. 2. Why no sweats? I could understand if this was at night, during \"club\" times, but... this was Sunday during the day.  3. If it was truly a dress code issue, I wouldn't have seen others in the bar with the same type of clothing.  I had friends in the restaurant speak to the manager, and he told them the full restrictions \"dress code\" wise.  1. NO Jordan's or high tops 2. NO Camo 3. NO sweatpants 4. NO chains  In my eyes, this points to one demographic, more than a general code for everyone, but that's not what this review is about, its about their code.  If this is the code, make it consistent. I shouldn't be able to see other patron's inside the establishment wearing the same thing i'm being denied for on the outside. THAT is unacceptable."}
{"text":"AHHH!   We brought my sister-in-law here for her week stay with us and it was amazing.   Everything about it was amazing.   She got the vegan sliders-amazing.  My fiancé got the hamburger sliders-amazing.  I got the pulled pork sliders-amazing.   We also got the pretzels and cheese from the appetizer menu-AMAZING.   For drinks, I got a frozen strawberry margarita and let's just say it tastes like juice--AMAZING.   We went there during happy hour so all of this was half off.   My fiancé and sister-in-law got a couple beers and really enjoyed them.   Our waiter, I can't remember his name, was amazing. He really was. He was so honest and energetic. He was great to be around.   The overall vibe of the place was amazing and comfortable.   We will return!"}
{"text":"If you have ALL day, and a big budget ($8 drafts and $16 burgers!!!), this place is for you.  If not, go anywhere else!  My boyfriend and I are always interested in trying new places.  On Mother's Day, we chose RnR as our new place to try.  When we arrived, we were told it would be about 30 minute wait for a table.  Not a problem except that they ask for a telephone number to call when the table is ready and because the music and noise level is so loud, the hostess wrote down the wrong number.  When we finally got a table, they didn't give us any menus and we had to ask.  The server that brought the menus also took our drink order which was promptly delivered.  After that, we never saw another server!  We sat at the table for over 30 minutes waiting for someone to come take our order but no one showed up.  Since we had already waited 45 minutes to get seated, we were very hungry and decided that the first time at RnR would also be our last.  We left cash on the table to cover the drinks, got up and left.  Our 2nd choice was far more enthusiastic to have our business and we will definitely visit that place again, but RnR is off our list!"}
{"text":"Very diverse menu, and most of what I've had has been really good. They make a house made Dijon that is amazing! The chicken lollipop appetizer is a great take on wings. Sliders are good too! Wife really liked the ahi salad. After 10p the entire food menu is half off"}
{"text":"The reverse happy hour is the best we got half off our meal.  Not just the starters.    We then had s salted Carmel martini...this us a must have....  They make the best."}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to go to dinner and she's been talking about this restaurant nonstop. Let's just say it was not what I expected at all.   My friend arrived there before I did. Nobody acknowledged her for about 15 minutes so she ended up seating herself. After I arrived we both actually ordered our drinks and entrees at the same time. She ordered the vegetarian tacos which came with a custom soy sauce. She asked the waiter what were the ingredients which he had no knowledge of and said he would bring it on the side for her. I ordered the chicken tacos and a glass of the Irony Pinor Noir while she ordered a peach ale beer.   First, it took 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. We sat by the bar so we noticed that they were just sitting on the counter for a good 10-15 minutes before we even received them. When he finally brought us our drinks, he apologized and said there was a delay because they ran out of my wine that I ordered. My friend told him that's unlikely since we've seen our glasses on the counter, FILLED for the past 20 minutes.   My friend then wanted to get some tortillas on the side. Our waiter did not come back to our table so she literally walked up to the bar to order her tortillas. Not to mention she never received the custom soy sauce on the side that she requested.   All in all, I was very disappointed. When i go to a restaurant there are two things that I look for . Good food and good customer service. It was a very unfortunate experience for me because I really enjoyed my food and my wine tasted remarkable. Such a disappointment for such a nice establishment with good food!"}
{"text":"Popsicle wings are so good mix and dip those sauces and coat them wings, wash them down with animal fries"}
{"text":"$10 dollars for three baby tacos with slivers and I mean slivers of fish or mushrooms, all on a wet plate?  No thanks, that was a rip off."}
{"text":"I was in Arizona for work, and had Sunday free, so I met with some local friends for lunch at this spot. On the smaller side, but has some booths/tables and a large bar downstairs, and a nice little upstairs area with a small bar.   They were busy, because football was on, and there was a wait for tables when we arrived. We put our name down and headed to the bar to grab a drink while we waited.  They offer a nice all you can drink special for $15. It includes bloody mary's and mimosas. If you like either of these options this is a great deal.   About 45 min in we were seated and offered menus. Service was a bit slow, but our waiter was very nice.  For lunch we actually claimed a yelp special which was four flights of beer and some of there dirty chips, which was basically chips with hot sauce, blue cheese, bacon, and I believe ranch. They were awesome to say the least haha. Aside from this we also got a couple of hamburgers and the chicken lollipops. Everything was good, however one of my friends orders came out incorrect. We sent it back, and ended up waiting so long for it to come back out we tried to cancel it. They ended up putting it in a to go box for us to take.  Overall not a bad little spot. I would probably give it another shot in the future, maybe on a slower day."}
{"text":"Kendall was very friendly and personable! Great drinks food looked great, we didn't have time to eat. They offer bottomless mimosas and bloody Mary's from 10-3 and they are great tasting and reasonably priced! We will be back and give Kendall a raise! :) !!"}
{"text":"Don't come durning spring training. They don't take reservations and you will wait for bad service and marginal food :-("}
{"text":"Hit this place the week it opened, back about a year ago, and it was a disaster.  music was too loud for how early it was (5pm), packed with typical scottsdale 30k millionaires looking to impress everyone, and intimidate the rest.  Not my typical scene, but we stuck it out. service was a mess, food was wrong, or just bad (our chicken \"lollipops\" tasted like they were fried in fish oil), but vowed to try it again. during a calm happy hour on a tuesday afternoon in March (when the giants weren't playing), decided to give it another try.  Service was much improved, no complaints.  in fact, i would say that our waitress was great.  she had great suggestions, explained some menu items and aspects of their happy hour, and was very attentive. I was able to score a couple jack manhattans at happy hour pricing, which is always a plus, and the dirty chips were great.  we decided to give the infamous \"lollipop\" chicken a second try, and it was great.  went with the buffalo sauce and, while not really very spicy, they were tasty. would definitely do it again for happy hour, if the atmosphere was right."}
{"text":"RnR has great food, but (at least today) it's kinda like eating at a night club.  Good wait staff and definately a spot for the beautiful people."}
{"text":"Great food and happy hour! A little pricey but it is worth what you pay! I had their Jalapeno mac n cheese appetizer one night and it was delicious! I plan on having my birthday party dinner here!"}
{"text":"Sports bar with open patio. It's loud and busy. Basic bar-like fare. Good burger and pulled pork sandwiches. Tasty sweet potato tots. However, parmesan fries were undercooked, sent back, and returned undercooked yet again Oh well."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. Slow service.  They only had warm draft beer that day because their coolers were not working that day and didn't offer any specials on bottles.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our stop.  I am huge fan Brussels and Bacon - excellent side.  Good place to have some cold ones and catch a game."}
{"text":"If you're reading this and you're in Scottsdale go ahead and go now. Great environment as well as good food. Now let me tell you about this cinnamon roll. It's as big as my head and it's good as hell. I've also had 2 of the burgers which are good as well. TVs all over so you can watch sporting events. If you are big on mimosas they have bottomless mimosas weekends from 11-3."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place numerous times and it always looks bumpin' so I finally decided to give it a try. I went on a saturday afternoon and it was wild, but in a good way. It was super loud and full of a younger crowd, which was perfect for me, I just wish they would have turned down the music so I didn't have to yell to talk to the person across from me. Aside from that, the margaritas were delicious and not too sweet, the prickly pear was my favorite. They have an awesome happy hour that includes half off drinks and I hear the mimosas are delicious. Included in the happy hour were food deals, so I went with the pretzel bites. I wasn't impressed because they were sliced and I was expecting poppers, but the grainy mustard paired well with it."}
{"text":"In town on business with several others.  We picked RnR last night.  Have eaten here several times.  Food is good, nothing special.  Menu selection not that great.  Service can be spotty.  It's not for lack of caring they are never staffed properly."}
{"text":"Mimosas mimosas and more mimosas!  Sunday Funday can only happen at the one and only RnR.    Make sure you get here early as tables are reserved first thing.  The foods absolute trash but the scene is on point.    Shout outs to the babes who work here.  I'd say 7s all around but it's worth a convo after a few drinks."}
{"text":"Absolute worst experience and service. We had an estimate of 30 min wait and after 2.5 hours we still weren't seated. The hostesses were very rude and didn't try to make things right or accommodate. Don't waste your time coming here. There are so many other places nearby that are way better."}
{"text":"Kayla was such a good server! Their frosè machine broke so she gave us margaritas for same price as the frosè Friday (ladies only) special, $5. I got the spicy mango margarita and it was GOOOOD! Their pretzel bites were yummmmy. I would definitely return for happy hour and frosè Friday's!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and the service is on point! Steve was a great and created me a brewmosa which if you didn't know is a Shock top and champagne. Literally better than a normal mimosa and if you want to be a little more manly this is what you need. Food is great and of course being a Giants fan born and raised in NorCal, this place is the giants bar."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the vibe this place gives off.  Tere are tons of TVs that'll satisfy a sports nut like myself.  Amazing beer selection.  My only complaint is the price of sliders here, I didn't think they should cost that much."}
{"text":"This place is bumpin for brunch.  A good spot in Tempe to watch some football/march madness or just hang out with friends.  The selection of food was delish.  The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich.  Everytime I have went it has been busy and packed...We sat outside, its been warmer and our waiter was there to greet us even though he was juggling a couple tables.  i suggest you Get the 4oz. Flight of Four craft beers...bam!  Yelp hooked me up with a discount since I checked in here...  Sweet As!"}
{"text":"I love RnR for Sunday Funday..Cassidy was out server and was absolutely amazing!! She's the best waitress I've had here...friendly and fast with out meals and refills!!"}
{"text":"We went to RnR with a travelzoo coupon which is always a nice way to try out a new place. Since we had to drive about 25 miles we decided not to drink but realized that only a few drinks could make you forget the loud music that was pumping nonstop throughout the restaurant.  The menu had some unique choices and we opted for animal fries, which was about 1/2 pound of pulled pork over French and Sweet potato fries - enough for more than two as an appetizer. We also ordered the mac and cheese and ahi tuna tacos which were good enough to order again. I would not call this a healthy lunch. It was a real heart stopper - literally.  They also have some specials and I noticed people drinking bellinis all over the place and realized that that it was an all you can drink special.  The crowd is young and hip (I am not but who cares) and I loved the ambiance and industrial look. Great for a bunch of people going out together for some fun but I wouldn't take a first date there because you'll be screaming at each other over the music.  Prices are reasonable for a hip joint on Scottsdale and the place was hopping on a Saturday afternoon."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale back in May for my nephew's graduation from ASU and we went to R & R for lunch and I had the ahi tuna tacos, OMG!  They're delicious and the presentation was just awesome!  We had a wonderful lunch, service was great.  When I came back home to California I google to see if we had a R & R restaurant here in California and sadly we don't.  I'm going to have to make a trip to Scottsdale to eat some ahi tuna tacos."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years. Jeremy Afeldt and co were serving beers for a charity event which we we were more than happy to contribut to! All of a sudden after spending over $100 dollars we were \"too\" drunk\" fuck these assholes! We spent hundreds of dollars only for then to her high and mighty on us! Four seven years we've been sending money here, no more!!!"}
{"text":"Allot to like here but with some reservations...Have gone twice once for lunch which was enjoyable and once when it was very busy, loud and disorganized.  Try the chicken lollipops(very small), good mac n cheese, pork sliders...tater tots good, fries not so much. Steak sandwich was good but a bit skimpy on the meat.  The few missteps: no one seems to be in charge, disorganized staff, no matter how many times we mentioned the soda was off they kept bringing more without addressing the problem!? Service really needs to be better to make this a go to spot.."}
{"text":"There is no other place to start your Sunday Funday! Brunch with bottomless mimosas/ bloody marys and delicious food.  You can't really go wrong with the menu, from two eggs anyway, french toast, breakfast taco plate, animal fries to the pulled pork sliders. The ambiance is very upbeat with their friendly servers and dj playing a compilation of different sets.  The only draw back is the wait. Depending on your party's size and what time you come it could be anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours to be seated. I highly suggest coming before 11 to put your name on the list, and while you wait go to the bar and let your bottomless Sunday Funday began."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the last time I came here so I decided to bring a friend from out of town. It had been a year but wow had things changed. The food was still good but the Parmesan fries were lacking. They use to have them tossed with Parmesan and parsley and they were so good. Now, they put plain fries in the bucket and then shake a bunch of Parmesan on top. Little disappointing. We also had a larger group of people. Our waitress spent most of her time up at the bar talking when the restaurant had maybe 30 people. She came and checked on us a few times but we had a bunch of dirty plates piling up and water cups that she never refilled. She also added gratuity to our checks which I understand, with a large party, is normal however she did NOT deserve it which is why I knocked down two stars. The bus boy however was amazing and super helpful with everything we needed!"}
{"text":"Okay place for the beers and burgers. They seem to have a little trouble cooking Burgers to temperature. Only 4 ppl eating food in the entire place, would hate to see what happens when they are busy. Our food came out about 10 minutes apart and we both had burgers?? Plus the French fries oil really needed to changed days ago. Tasted and smelled stale. Gross. The food would be a 2 star n the service was good but combined no more than a lucky 3 for them. The management knew there were problems and took care of our meal."}
{"text":"3 visits - one for drinks, one for food, one for something in between. Conclusion? Blink....blink....ummm....it's ok. 1. The drinks were not all that impressive but served their purpose, meaning I felt a little buzz, my head was boppin back n forth to the tunes, I was enjoying myself for the most part. Kinda fun atmosphere with loud, bustling energy abound. The salads actually looked quite delicious, but I wasn't there to eat. The intrigue was enough to return.  2. I then had a surprise birthday party here for my boyfriend and the staff was very accommodating. They reserved the upstairs balcony for our group and served up the birthday cake we brought. They were very, very attentive to our table and came around often with drinks. The service was actually great compare to the experiences others have had here. Tried a couple of bites of someone's sweet potato fries that tasted oh-so delish, but later I came to find it was probably to booze and my fried food frenzy playing tricks on me.  3. We returned for a late dinner the other night and I took a shot at the veggie fare. Veggie Tacos: Well the \"shell\" was thinly sliced jicama, which I can appreciate because I love funky fusion. But this was like $6 for 1 oz of food. Then reminiscing about the sweet potato fries, I ordered a side and was giddy with anticipation until I received a pile of lukewarm lumps. So very sad that a good sweet potato met such a bitter end.  I'll probably end up back here someday and will probably eat sweet potato fries because of my sweet potato problem. But I won't be planning that venture myself."}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Place. I'm from Dallas visiting my best friend for the weekend and she had made plans for Sunday brunch. We get here, it's packed but even with a completely full two story restaurant, the service was consistent and impeccable. They have bottomless mimosas for $20 with the purchase of an entree and when I say, I NEVER had an empty glass...! Teresa was literally perfect, from coaching me through the menu to continuing service hours after got our to-go's and were just enjoying our drinks. wI wish I could take this place back with me to Dallas!!"}
{"text":"a must for College football Saturdays. many many fans representing, not just ASU during away games.   also, perhaps some of the best people watching. and by people, i mean college kids.   and by college kids, I mean drunk, horny, loud, brash, tequila-swigging-while-holding-a-sparks-spitting-firework-in-one-hand (the penultimate \"whats the worst that could happen?\" moment for all involved), college and recently-out-of-college kids.  but it works.   and it's glorious."}
{"text":"We wanted to try having brunch here however there was no greeter at the door for seats and the music was soooooooooooooo loud I don't even know how anyone can have a conversation or the servers take your order. I'm not old but the loudness of that music made us turn away because of the dangerous noise volume I'm sure they are hitting.  Reply: thank you so much for your reply, I appreciate you taking the time out of your day to address my opinion. Now I do like lively places, I enjoy great music and having fun while eating and drinking, I'm usually the one dancing on the table, lol. But the noise level even the look on some of those people's faces were practically cringing trying to talk to others. And I saw little conversation which I'm sure is due to the fact that it was too much work to talk over the extremely loud volume. I was just excited to go back and have some fun with some family members but literally couldn't hear myself think."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for brunch on Sunday Funday. If you are doing mimosas or brunch on a Sunday this is THE place to be.  The mimosas/bloddy marys are flowing, DJ is blasting music like it's a club at 1am and it's actually a SF Giants bar. What more could you want?  Just get there early, because you ARE going to be waiting for a table, even if you're there when it opens. You're still somehow waiting for a table. So just get drunk on mimosas and pretty soon you'll forget how long you are waiting.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bottomless mimosas on Saturdays are amazing. Brian is a boss. Our drinks were never empty."}

{"text":"Is it true?  Has the hip-urban-kool Phoenix scene made its way into Scottsdale in the form of the Vig meets Daily Dos meets the Parlor catch all known as RnR?   Seems to be the case.  Smack in the middle of OT Scottsdale is a piece of Phoenix...sort of.  Is it sexy, you bet, great location, yep - the design is takes a page from all of the latest new places with stone, steel and wood, striving for an industrial yet comfortable feel.  It seems that with a ground up build, more attention could have been paid to flow and energy.  At first glimpse it looks like the place you want to be.   However, where ever I sit I feel like I am not part of the party.  Inside leaves me left out of the small but covered and comfy patio.  Outside leaves me disconnected from the energy of the bar.  And the much ballyhooed upstairs, although very fun and different makes me feel all alone.    The breakfast especially the Chambord French toast and the sundried scramble are absolutley fantastic, but with an Ice Tea, Tax and Tip, I can't escape the place for less than $20 bucks, solo.  MaybeI am cheap but a little much for breakfast.  Lunch and Dinner are solid but nothing to write home about, I did enjoy the grilled cheese.   The beverage menu is pretty impressive and once the servers are trained enough to help me navigate the unique wine list, I might have more fun with it.  The Service sadly comes across as if this part of the equation is an afterthought.  I have had 5 or 6 different servers.  Product and menu knowledge sporadic.  An attitude is hit or miss.  To be fair I have had  some stellar service experiences, but the norm is a perfuntcory at best, mildly interested routine.  I say all this yet I keep going back - 3 stars come from the fact that at this point it is the only place in Scottsdale I can get this Phoenix-like experience.  Ultimately I think there is great potential and I will be rooting for them.    Luckily I live walking distance from The Vig Uptown - Ah Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love it! The food was excellent. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was one of the best I've ever had! The drink menu is huge, over 2 pages! We came here to watch March Madness and we were not disappointed! They had 16 TV's. Service was adequate, given they were extremely busy. Don't come here if you want a quite place, it was extremely loud. We had to yell at each other to hear. Overall excellent experience."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm getting too old to enjoy loud music - so loud you're basically yelling at the person sitting next to you - at 10 AM on a Saturday, but RnR wasn't for me. I feel like it's trying too hard to push for an experience that resonates of amazing, crazy, youthful, full of party animals, and outrageous, but it ends up feeling cheesy, forced, and a little more on the unpleasant side.  The menu is big, and drinks range from reasonably priced to whaaat? NO! There are some good bottomless brunch cocktail specials on the weekend. I didn't try the food so I can't really comment.  After having one round, we left. I think given the right mindset (and time of day), RnR could be fun, but it'll be a good while before I give it another go."}
{"text":"The food. The environment. The drinks. The staff. Are all on point!!  We always make it a priority to stop by RnR when in old town"}
{"text":"This review is a warning to anyone over the age of 25. Don't go. Just don't go. You will get nothing from this experience beyond this age. Quite honestly, I would have hated that place when I was 21 too. It's one of those kind of places ur friends try to convince u is cool but deep down, even tho u want to fit in, it's just not.   But because I was on a girls trip with my younger girlfriends, I went, having no idea just how laughingly horrible it would all be!!   I don't even write reviews but I truly feel the need to warn anyone who showed up so unaware of what was about to happen like i did!   First of all. The service. Jesus, she couldn't have been more vapid and inattentive. I realize waiting on women well beyond the cut off age there was pry not the highlight of her day, but guess what... middle aged women are pretty good tippers!  You didn't get the chance to find out because how many times did we have to track u down for a refill on the BOTTOMLESS mimosas? Here's a tip for ya. If ur at the bar waiting on a drink order, that would b a great time to take that pitcher in front of u, and maybe refill the tables right next to you! 1 min, tops!   The food. Blah! Ordered the pork hash. I think it was supposed to come with some chili sauce? It didn't and it tasted like absolutely nothing.  Don't even bother if u think ur going to get that satisfaction of a great hangover cure brunch choice. It's so bitterly disappointing, you will want to cry.   The ambiance: started out fun, upbeat. Before the food came, (and the shitshow to follow) I thought my friend had steered us to the perfect little brunch spot.   Give it an hour. Before u know it, your food sucks, your server goes MIA, and cue the DJ! You look around and suddenly it's a Sunday morning nightclub!  I'm still just so confused by this! Haha! Do 20 something's really find this fun??? It's such s stupid concept! Haha! I have a 25 year old. I know he would hate this as much as me! We would die laughing together at how insipid and comical it really is!  It was really topped off with the beaver shot we were forced to look at throughout our meal. As soon as our food showed up, so did a party of 4 with a \"lady\" wearing a romper from the little girls department that everything u can imagine was hanging out. My table, all waxing estheticians by trade takes a lot to shock or offend us... We. Couldn't. Stop. Dying over this!!! We will talk about it for years to come!!! Haha!  I guess I find it funny that I read the reviews of the \"strict\" dress code on jogging pants? But this is acceptable brunch attire? Whatever   So to sum it all up, if u have no mind of your own, don't care to actually converse with your friends over food, maybe you feel like the night before didn't go as planned and u need one more shot at taking someone home.... this is your place!  It certainly isn't for the food or the service or the laid back atmosphere.  Not mad... just thoroughly bemused and bewildered this exists and people come! Haha!   I should give myself one star for not knowing what I was about to step into."}
{"text":"Not much good to say about RnR other than the fact that it's like a brunch nightclub- Pumping music, beautiful youthful crowd, trendy, industrial-esque surroundings.  We called to make a reservation for an 18 person party a month in advance and called three days before the reservation to change the number from 18 to 25. They told us it wouldn't be a problem at all!  Well, WHEN WE GOT THERE THEY COULDN'T FIND THE RESERVATION.  They \"apologized\" but we had to pretty much wing it which left a bad taste on all of our mouths.  So...we got a table upstairs that seated 6, pushed another table that seated 4 next to it and had to have the rest of our guests sit away from everyone else at tables of two. It was a hot.mess. and we were not.happy.  The $18 bottomless mimosas were watered down.  They had a menu full of frozen margaritas but weren't serving any of them the morning we were there.  The food was below average. I ordered an omelette with potatoes, cheese, and avocado. It was super dry (overcooked) and ultra bland.  This was my first visit to RnR and it will absolutely be my last."}
{"text":"Good food every time I go, good atmosphere, but the 4 rating and not the 5 because our service could have been a little better. Other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"Got the shrimp tacos. Tasted good. But for how much they charge for them only two tacos the amount of food you get does not fill you up. I will still hungry and you get no side dish with it. Definitely would get something else on the menu if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Best Sunday Funday in town.  Must arrive early if you want to have a table, we have often gone elsewhere due to wait time being over 3 hours."}
{"text":"Meeh. For some reason this place always looks full... It's ok.  Typical, trendy Scottsdale bar... just like the typical Snotsdale guys with designer jeans, Affliction shirts, pointy leather shoes and large belt buckles.  This is a place you can go, look cute and have skee-zoids buy you free drinks all night- but that is all. Can't dance crazy, get freaky on the bar top... or even LAUGH.   The people here ARE pretentious and they would JUDGE you if you tried ANY of the above.  We had a few drinks here, got bored, and went somewhere else.."}
{"text":"Day drinking in old town?!  THIS IS YOUR PLACE!  The atmosphere is just awesome, we sat outside and drank celebrating my birthday, the waitress's were so prompt with the service, we had a big party and a lot of drinks and food coming. I will be back and probably on an even crazier day like Sunday. Sunday fun day I'm coming for you."}
{"text":"Stopped in RnR on Sunday for their bottomless mimosas. Della was taking care of us and she was nothing short of amazing. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had fun here, got a little crazy here with friends. Good crowd. Just hoping no one took pictures."}
{"text":"So I went into have a good time after a game. I'm having fun, listening to music, watching USA vs PR, and the guy behind the bar was a huge prick. Don't ever go here. I'll never go back. I've come here every year for over a decade, but never again. Go anywhere else that allows you to celebrate and have a good time."}
{"text":"Food was good, Service ok too, although the waitress was checking on us often, she missed on details such as bringing a spoon with my coffee, and she said they couldn't do a soy latte.. but brought me soy milk on the side.. Music was good and loud!"}
{"text":"Awesome drinks and appetizers! Get the dirty chips! Waitstaff was super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Sunday funday at its finest! Whenever we get a chance to bring our friends from out of town here, they are completely in awe of the vibrant, fun, upbeat ambience. Think day partying meets sports spectating on lots of TVs with a DJ mixing upbeat, top hits in the background. Perfect weather 80% of the year allows for this open aired restaurant/bar where you can see out to the street and watch pedestrians and cars pass as you party. Decent food with lots of menu options. All you can drink mimosa specials. Pair all of that with perfect patio seating and people watching some of Scottsdale's finest means you've got one fun, entertaining time!   One of the things I love most about this place is that you will see people of all ages and backgrounds enjoying themselves. Free parking in Old Town Scottsdale is also a big plus. Jump on one of the \"free\" ($10 minimum) golf carts and you can hit up a plethora of other bars and clubs to get the rest of your Sunday funday bar crawling on!"}
{"text":"I went hard here. By hard, I mean I went so hard that my floor felt like a pillow later on because I went so hard.   Go here on a Saturday right when they open and set up camp. I went here with a group of friends and we all ended up taking advantage of the unlimited mimosa deal. It was phenomenal.  I didn't order food, but pulled an Oliver Twist and roamed around taking their food while they were plastered. Let me say, I tried half the menu and that food is worth every penny.  Place is dope. Hit it up as soon as possible. Get those unlimited mimosas and have a day to remember."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling RnR at all!  We don't usually venture into Scottsdale for many reasons, but the siren song of a non-pretentious late night eatery was just calling to us.  Unfortunately, non-pretentious doesn't apply to the prices.  We came shortly after opening day, so I completely forgive the awful service, the place was packed.  I was irritated though when we were told they were only going to be serving sandwiches and burgers, nothing else, even though we were specifically told that this place would have breakfast all day.  Breakfast is what I wanted.  Oh well.    We ordered the burger and got some mini corn dogs as an appetizer.  The mini corn dogs left a lot to be desired.  They were served with plain ol' ketchup and plain ol' yellow mustard.  Yuck.  The corn dogs were only okay.  The breading around them was way too bread like and it was just lacking in flavor.  The burger was enormous.  Unfortunately, what it lacked any flavor.  I guess what it lacked in flavor it was clearly making up for in size.  The bacon that came on it was equally huge, roughly 2 inches wide and at least 8 inches long... (that's what she said! Ohhhh!)  Anyway, I was obviously not impressed.  We might come back sometime, because their breakfast really does sound wonderful, but hopefully they've figured out how to efficiently serve a busy restaurant by then."}
{"text":"I didn't even eat here and probably won't because they're customer service is extremely terrible.  We went up to see how long the wait would be and before I could finish saying \"hi\" to the rude ass hostess, she answers the phone.  At least say \"just one second please\".  Then this heffa had the nerve to stay on the phone for longer than she needed to be.  I have no desire to ever go back to this place after being treated like we had no money."}
{"text":"Bumpe up to a 4.  this place deserves it!  Tots Fun.  Tots Cool.  Tots The SHIZZLE!  \"Dirty Bits... Dirty Bits..\"  *singing*  whenever I pass this restaurant, I think of that song by the Blackeyed Peas \"The TIme -- Dirty Bits\" because this restaurant has these awesome Dirty Chips!   Homemade chips with blue cheese, bacon, cheese... Yums... I usually love them.  I like RnR for 2 reasons... Dirty Chips and Sunday Brunch/Day Party.  When I have friends in town, this is the place we skip church to go to for food and bottomless Mimosa's and Bloody Mary's from 10-3pm.  If you have these type of friends in town, this is a cool place to go for brunch and bypass the snooty brunch locations in Phoenix/Scottsdale.    RnR has the craziest hours of a restaurant like this... 8am - 2am.  Yes folks... I have gone here after a night out for those Dirty Chips.... Dirty Chips. *singing*  A DJ starts around 10ish.  If you have a large party, make a reservation.  Get there just before 10 to avoid the crowd.  This place calls itself a Gastropub, but I wouldn't.  I think of it as a cool local bar eatery.  Return Factor: 100%."}
{"text":"Right next to the SF Giants spring training facility.  Each time I've come it was for a work function and I don't know how it is like outside of that in terms of being crowded, but the food is really good and I have enjoyed the nachos each time. Good gastropub next to the stadium"}
{"text":"I want to love this place!  It serves brussel sprouts!  Any place that serves brussel sprouts that taste so good should be great.   But it isn't.   Well, the food is, or at least all the food I've tried in my 2 visits with friends. My problem is that both times I've gone on weekdays during lunch...so NOT happy hour, NOT dinner.  At lunch, you have 2 choices: - You can sit inside where you can freeze to death (in the summer).  I was wearing long sleeve and jeans, and still dying; or,  - You can sit outside, where at 11:30 am they blast music so loudly that you can't even have a conversation with the rest of your table.  We just sat and looked at each other and laughed hysterically cause there was nothing else to do.  After several complaints to the server, who kept telling us he couldn't lower the volume, we asked another server and, voila!  it worked.  But I hear this is a daily occurrence.    I love loud music...in my car, in the shower, at a club, at a bar.  Not at my 11:30 lunch.  Maybe I'm just getting too old."}
{"text":"What did you say?! I CAN'T HEAR YOU!  \"I SAID RABBITS EAT LETTUCE!\" (South Park, Season 1)  This is the loudest goddamn bar on earth. I know some dance clubs that aren't this loud. Everything about this place is obnoxious. Douche-faced bartenders pour weak drinks at outrageous prices... and like I said, most of the time the music is so loud that you can't hear the person next to you.  Saving graces: Bottomless Mimosas, Saturday and Sunday. Although the food is outrageously expensive, it is good.  Loud."}
