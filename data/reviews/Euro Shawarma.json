{"text":"I've had better shawarama, it just tastes a little bland to me. The homemade hot sauce is pretty good though. Since its so close by to my office, I wouldn't mind having lunch here once in awhile."}
{"text":"One of the best if not THE best beef shawarma sandwich in the city. I know this is a very bold statement but I truly mean it. Came here after reading decent reviews on yelp, which is hard to find decent Shawarma places on. I have only good things to say about this place. The staff is great and it is a clean environment which is always a plus. What will have you coming back again though is the food which is of course the most importat factor.  They do a great job layering the sandwich evenly and the meat tiself that they use is super tastey and they give you a solid portion. The greatest part about this place though for me is the sauces. Always one of the most important componenst of a Shawarma, sauce can be very hit and miss at certain places. The garlic sauce, tzatziki and especially hot sauce are so amazing I don't know what to say. This is a hidden gem located in a fairly rough neighberhood that everyone needs to try. I am so glad I came across this place and have a reliable Shawarma spot to hit on a daily. FIY Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"If u go during rush time good luck because it gets packed in there..I will say the chicken shawarma I feel is pricey. More than I pay at other places.. But is it good?? I hate to say yes. It's really damn good and is not wrapped rather stuffed. U get to pick ur toppings and sauces. The meat is everything.. I think I tried the platter too. Both real good"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and modern, I was surprised when I walked in.  I had the chicken shawarma sandwich. It wasn't the best shawarma I've had but it was still good and filling for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Very good service there.... always have fresh children rolling there, many kinds of vegetables to be created your salad...it's my most favor spot for shawanma..."}
{"text":"This place has the best prepared sides of any other shawarma place. I have frequented this place and everyone that comes here knows that other places do not come close. It can get very busy and the beef kofte sandwich while delicious takes 15 minutes. They also use a different pita than other places, might be smaller but they stuff it pretty well. You will not regret coming here."}
{"text":"My pick for the best shawarma in town. Service is always quick and pleasant. Sometimes the debit machine hives me issues. I usually go for the chicken shawarma sandwich and alternate my sides between the lentil soup (which is delicious) and the potatoes (which have some kind of sauce seasoning on them and then when paired with the tzatziki sauce is so flavourful). They use a round pita style bread and put chicken in first then everything you want then chicken again which is why its so good. Plus the individual things make it as well."}
{"text":"No rice for you!  I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode when the the worker refused to put rice in my Shawarma.  He looked at me like I was asking for a miracle to be done.  
The size of the Shawarma itself is small compared to other places.  The taste is mediocre. Nine bucks with a pop 
Will not return"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma plate every time I go!  It's fresh and delicious.  Great customer service as well.  I come here at least once a month."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma places in the city. Never disappointed us or any of our friends. Portions are big and very delicious. Side salads have variety and tasty as well."}
{"text":"This is the BEST shawarma in town!! When you see the other reviews that say such - BELIEVE THEM. We've travelled the world and this place knows what they're doing!

Their salads are amazing. If you order a shawarma plate, the salad selection you are given cannot be beat --  and the staff is great. I would question the bad reviews on here for sure. I would say go for the chicken -- great flavor profile.

The food is ALWAYS fresh -- and this place is usually always busy - in a GOOD way. You can see that they are developing a great reputation and people come back for more. In the summer they buy their produce local, and at farmers markets. They aim for organic produce. You can't find this quality just anywhere.

The interior is surprising - a nice little place - you wouldn't expect it when viewing from the street. 

THUMBS UP."}
{"text":"Favourite shawarma place! Food is delicious and they don't charge extra for any sides!"}
{"text":"The ingredients were so fresh and the chicken shawarma sandwich tasted really good. My favorite is the Garlic Potatoes which is fresh as they sell out so quickly. At times the service can be a little slow, but altogether definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Seriously. Hands down best shawarma I've had. 

I just went to a Lebanese festival and had a shawarma but all I could think of was the deliciousness of a shawarma from Euro Shawarma.

I've been frequenting this place since I've moved nearby. My go to is the chicken shawarma sandwich/pita. They don't skimp out on the chicken, and they load it up with whatever veggies you end up choosing. 

For an extra $2 dollars you can add a can of pop and a side to make it a combo. GET THE GARLIC POTATOES. You won't regret. I've also tried the lentil soup and that was pretty tasty as well. 

They only downside is that accept Debit or Cash."}
{"text":"Can be busy at lunch (even as late as 1:30). Fresh and flavourful. I had the falafel sandwich and lentil soup. Very good but a bit heavy in the sauce department, will just request less next time because I'm likely to be back."}
{"text":"I had the shawarma sandwich for lunch.. wasn't too bad. Chicken was a little too dry/ overcooked. Fresh juicy toppings and ample sauce was a good attempt to cover up the dryness. Would probably explore other options in the area next time I pass through the area. Although I'm partial to trying the falafel sandwich next time as well.. start tuned."}
{"text":"I legitimately joined Yelp to review this place.

Keele and Wilson is not an area that I ever frequent unless I am there for work-related issues.

I also am not traditionally a big shawarma fan, nor a big falafel fan.

Nevertheless, I ran out of options after being in the area for weeks on end, and decided to give the falafels at Euro Shawarma a shot.   I later returned on numerous occasions and eventually tried the shawarma.

Falafel:

I am able to say with absolute confidence that you will enjoy the falafel sandwich at this place.  The falafels are freshly made to each order and have that tell-tale sign of freshness to them (bright green in the middle). 

The toppings they offer are always fresh and numerous (great cole slaw; great cabbage; nice hot sauce). The pitas are also always on point.   Tahini is solid as well.

To top it all of, a combo of the falafel with side of spicy garlic potatoes (also absolutely FANTASTIC) and a pop comes in under 8 bucks. 

Shawarma:

I am truly not a big shawarma fan, but the odd time it hits the spot.  After hearing multiple people at other tables rave about how good their shawarma was, I decided to give it a go.  The chicken is outstanding, and the previously mentioned toppings remain a fantastic addition.   You can also get the shawarma plate - I elect to skip the rice and use more of the cole slaw/cabbage/salad.   They then add a tzatziki type sauce and garlic sauce if you want.   Both are excellent.

In all, this place is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC and I wish it nothing but the best of success."}
{"text":"WOW! extremely busy place, go before lunch hour or after!

I have done take out twice from them. Their Beef Shawarama let me tell you if made properly, this  thing is awesome! The only difference it they make it like a pita sandwich and not roll it like others. The toppings are fresh, the meat is fresh and off the grill and the spices are just amazing. 

The restaurant has fair bit of seating and was clean. The line up gets quite big but they try to move them as fast as possible as there are 4 to 5 people working in lunch time.

This place serves halal meat as per there menu."}
{"text":"After trying this place once I will most likely not come back.

Ordered for my coworkers and I chicken shawarma dinner which the rice was terrible it was hard almost like little pebbles. The chicken was clearly overcooked and dry I honestly did not enjoy my meal at all for lunch. Not worth the 10$. 

Been to other places that are way better and a lot cheaper than this place.

Purely just out of convience since its located down the street from the office :)"}
{"text":"I will pay good money for the tzatziki sauce recipe. They really should sell it."}
{"text":"ordered from these people on just eat and never again/
1) no beef have to change order
2) pay delivery charge and driver tip
3) driver phones, not buzz
4) come to lobby we do not go to apt\"

are you people nutz?
never again"}
{"text":"It was one of those days for me that I have been cravingly searching for some good Mediterranean food around my bfs neighbourhood. It took me weeks to finally find what I have been longing for!

As we were driving on the way home my bf happened to point out the shawarma joint as he remembered that I've been searching for it. The exterior & sign was deceiving as it looked like one of those run of the mill restaurants. BOY I WAS WRONG!

As we entered we were greeted very courteously & the service was excellent. The interior looked very well updated, bright & such clean dining area indeed. 

I had the chicken shawarma dinner to go & had any toppings along side w/ my meal. I also had an odd request of just ordering 1 falafel w/ my meal & it was free charge! Which awesome, who doesn't love free food!

This place has got to be better than any another joints in this area for sure. Now that this place is no longer a Chinese Hakka Restaurant & has been taken over by Euro Shawarma...you will surely be seeing more of me :D"}
{"text":"I usually stick to wraps/sandwiches at these places and I'd say this is one of the better ones in the city. I've been a few times and I usually get the beef and it's been good every time. Falafel is also great, and the value/quality is there... they always come through."}
{"text":"OK folks, while I can't vouch for the authenticity of the shawarma, I can tell you this is freaking delicious stuff. I went only because of the reviews and because we were starving and I'm glad I did! I bought the beef and chicken shawarma. My mom hasn't tried the chicken shawarma yet but I can tell you the beef shawarma was amazing. The seasoning was great and what made it unique were all the toppings. They added a couple different sauces throughout, some sweet, some spicy so that it was moist throughout. Also had toppings of green cabbage salad, radicchio salad, chickpeas, parsley, tomato and cucumbers. Truly the best shawarma sandwich i have ever had and let me tell you I have had plenty of them. Try it and you won't be disappointed. We took our food to go but the interior was clean and bare bones. I wouldn't take a date that you want to impress here, but then again, who cares about the date? Come here for the food!"}
{"text":"These guys were fantastic. The quality of food and the taste were impeccable. The service was over the top with a complimentary lentil soup....I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best shawarma I've ever had. They have so many toppings and salads that other places don't have (or don't do right). I frequently go out of my way to go to this place, I'm addicted! Definitely one of my top 10 favourite foods of all time."}
{"text":"Only wanna say that \"they serve you cold food\" Horrible  experience. I ordered  chicken  shawarma plate. Chicken itself and rice were all hard and cold. I am not coming back. You shdnt  be paying  $10.99 plus tax for terrible  food like this place serves."}
{"text":"I was treated very well here by friendly and welcoming staff. The chicken shawarma sandwich I ordered was fresh and served up quickly. I was given a complimentary cup of lentil soup which rounded out my meal. The interior of the restaurant was clean. i was happy and felt appreciated there so I am returning the favour by writing this review."}
{"text":"Its a nice and Clean place but kitchen is small and  no hot drinks cause of Tim Horton's monopoly next door. Will come back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"The best shawarma in Toronto and it gets better every time you come back."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day. Fair price, huge portions, great quality, friendly staff. Salad selection is amazing. Chicken is really good. Sandwiches are layered using some sort of magical technique. And then they put the little triangle piece on top...brilliant."}
{"text":"It's absolutely insane how many times I've passed by and haven't tried the falafel plate.  There is also a nice dining area as well if you wish to stay.  Did I mention... Baklava galore?!"}
{"text":"One the best turkish shawarma places in torontl. I always get the shawarma combo with potatoes and a drink. They wrap and pack their shawarma in a unique way. Really worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this place, there is something about their tzatziki sauce that has my mouth water every time I think about it! When I first came here, I was put off by the size of their pita (it was so small), but I couldn't even finish it when I got to eat it. Hands down the best shawarma I have ever had. I've probably brought every one of my friends here! Goes on my list of cheap-eats."}
{"text":"Love this place. Never disappoints. Hands down the best shawarma in the area. One of the best in the city too. The pitas here are different than most places and the chicken and sauces have a great flavour but the star of the show is the plates. A generous portion of food when you sit down to eat a shawarma plate and all the same goodies and more than what you get in their pitas. Usually
Enough seating inside although at times it does get pretty busy. 4.5/5 for me"}
{"text":"I adore the exotic flavors of the Middle East and that's what I was craving for when I went to Euro Shawarma. I should have known something was up when I noticed \"Euro\" in the name. 

According to their website their food is \"organically produced\" and \"locally grown\". Modern decor with a roomy and clean dining area. To order, the line starts at the opposite end of the cash register. You place your order, pay, grab your drink and wait for them to call you; staff were pleasant and friendly. Certain items take up to 15 minutes to prepare which they will warn you about; otherwise, food comes out quick. Food was ok, but what threw me off was that it tasted like they used mayo instead of yogurt in their tzatziki sauce. It changed the whole flavor profile of what an authentic shawarma should taste like; but now I get it, that's the Euro twist AHA! 

So this is one of those places where you'll either love it or hate it, depending on your tastebuds; they do however have generous portions at reasonable prices. 

As for me, I'll stick to the more traditional places; but I do highly recommend getting their delicious sütlaç (rice pudding) and veggie samosa."}
{"text":"Delicious shawarma. Clean restaurant and tons of seating area. Parking is easy to find. Staff are friendly and quick. Lots of fresh sides to put into pita and they give you quite a lot. Decently priced. 

Update: price has gone up, taste has gone down. Don't know what happened but the last couple times since coming here, the flavour is not as tasty nor juicy. The price point has increased way too much, would be checking out new shawarma joints."}
{"text":"Over price and salad are not fresh I was dissapointed ! 
Order a tbone steak combo asked for medium rare, my streak was cooked and didnt have any flavour.  :(  I will not be going there 
They said it took 20 minutes to make the steak."}
{"text":"Simply delicious.

The ingredients were fresh and a solid notch above what you'd get at most shawarma places. Gone are the stale piles of iceberg lettuce and pitiful tomatoes; instead there's chickpea mixes, parsley, pickled toppings, and of course, delicious (and plentiful) garlic sauce, an absolute necessity for good shawarma.

The meat itself was amazing and boy do they stuff a lot of it into those little pockets. Don't be fooled by what looks like a small pita btw, they pack a lot in there. Even me, someone who usually orders extra meat was more than satisfied by the size (and protein content) of the offering. If you want an extra treat try the garlic potatoes - they're a delicious side if you want to share with a friend.

And if you somehow still have some room leftover, try the homemade baklava, I honestly can't remember having had better at very many places. I shared one piece and immediately wanted another despite how stuffed I was.

And to top it off the place is clean and has quick and great service, even with all of the customers they get.

Definitely treat yourself to this place!"}
{"text":"Beef shwarma is delicious! The place is clean and comfortable. Love it there. Prices are good."}
{"text":"This review is based on the over 20+ times that I have eaten there.  Can honesty say that I have never had a bad meal there. Portions are huge for a fantastic price.  The service has always been quick and courteous.  The eat in is large with comfortable seating a  few TV's going.  There is usually a large line up at lunch hour but the staff keep the line moving well and efficiently.  Love the roasted potatoes with garlic sauce!!"}
{"text":"Got a chicken shawarma sandwich. Pretty bland... a boring eat. Won't go back. Especially for its high price"}
{"text":"Kinda pricey but pretty good shawarma. Don't be fooled by the size of the wrap, its packed full. Gets pretty busy around lunchtime when all the government workers go there."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Euro Shawarma.

When I got there, it was jammed with school kids ordering French fries but cleared out really quickly.

I ordered a chicken shawarma. There are lots of ingredients you can have on it ... I had extra chicken, tomatoes, humus, garlic sauce and tahini.  It was a good shawarma.  The meat was nicely spiced and was tender.

I'll be back if I'm craving a shawarma in that 'hood!"}
{"text":"Pluses:  reasonable price, generous portions.  

Minuses:  My chicken shawarma sandwich (pita) for some reason was very greasy - the paper bag was literally soaked with grease.  Big turnoff for me personally.  They are busy and the food is fresh, but have definitely experienced better.  Even the hot sauce tasted oily.  

Having said that, cheap price, very generous portions."}
{"text":"Best shawarma's in the area! They give so much as the chicken shawarma plate is hugeeee, couldn't even finish it all. The toppings were fresh and delicious. Service is incredibly fast and there's many seats in the house to sit down and enjoy.  

For such a reasonable price also, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area craving for shawarma's."}
{"text":"Nice place, shawarma is very tasty. Good spot for lunch. I had a chicken shawarma and definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is located right beside the Tim Hortons. 
The chicken shawarma tasted good and the ingredients they put inside did taste good but the only reason i had to put a 3 star rating was because of the amount of the items put in the shawarma. 
First the pita is very small (compared to many other shawarma places if been) and when they were putting the ingredients in like the pickles etc they only put in 1 or 2 pieces (really small pieces) and the amount of meat wasn't a lot. 
Don't be discouraged because it did taste good just a small amount."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and amazing customer service. I would strongly suggest this restaurant."}
{"text":"I picked up a shawarma for lunch and I'm not too sure if I'm off base here or if it was just a bad day for them but I have been eating shawarma since I was a little kid in the Middle East and this was not a good shawarma. I would recommend paramount if you want a decent sandwich. Either way there is no way I'm going back here."}
{"text":"Great spot to eat middle eastern food the quantity of food I got was good portion.... hopefully they keep the same in long run. Beef kebab made fresh took 10 min to get ready but worth while for wait. Will be coming to eat again."}
{"text":"First time I went there, the shwarma was good but I noticed that their garlic sauce seems to be mayo based, and the cabbage tasted dirty and not like it was pickled properly, however, the meat tasted great so I went back. Second time, the meat was way Way, too salty (guess they don't measure) and the cabbage still tasted gross. Too bad they aren't consistent, don't measure or taste food they serve because I would have been a new regular :("}
{"text":"I have had countless shawarmas from this place. Their pita is always fresh and never dried out. They put a generous amount of chicken and salads. The best part is their sauces which once again they generously add. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had a chicken shawarma sandwich earlier today. Great quality shawarma meat, sandwich is in a mini pita and the ingredients to accompany it were fresh and fantastic. Reasonable prices and a nice clean place to eat. I recommend you eat here."}
{"text":"This seems like an appropriate choice for my first Yelp! review. I know if there was a more positive review for this restaurant, I would've checked it out a lot sooner. I work less than a block away from this place but it just looked like another mediocre shawarma place so I steered clear of it for a while.

The first time I went, I was really surprised by how good it was! The chicken in my shawarma was tasty and plentiful. They also allow you to choose what you want in your sandwich Subway-style, everything from lettuce to cabbage, turnips, banana peppers, tabouleh, chickpeas, etc. The sandwiches don't end up with the meat and veggies perfectly distributed, but they at least try. Staff is friendly and efficient. The restaurant is clean and decent-looking and the bathrooms are pretty nice.

My only gripe is that the chicken shawarma comes out to ~6.75 including tax, which is a bit on the high side (but not bad enough to keep me from coming about once a week)."}
{"text":"The shawarma here tastes amazing and definitely better than your average shawarma joint! All the ingredients looked and tasted fresh, and the carved chicken wasn't dry at all.
The highlight of this place is their sauces though. The garlic sauce they use is super rich and the white sauce they use is creamy and reminded me of big mac sauce-but it somehow worked great with all the other ingredients.

My only complaint would be for the size of their shawarma sandwiches. These things were smaller than I expected for the price, and were more like stuffed pitas than traditionally wrapped sandwiches . The shawarma plates that other people got, however, looked packed with meat and seemed like a much better deal. I would recommend ordering the plates over the sandwiches for this reason-especially if you're really hungry!

The restaurant itself was clean and had a good amount of tables for dining in. The staffing looked adequate for the consistent stream of patrons that frequented this place. Overall, a great place to get your shawarma fix on! =)"}
