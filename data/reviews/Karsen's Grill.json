{"text":"I ordered the Scottsdale salad, it was served with raw chicken. Not only that but the waitress had a bit of attitude when we were just asking questions about the menu. Small little place, good beer, but I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"This bar & grill is small in size but the food, staff, and drinks are far from that. If you walk out disappointed you're most likely a high maintenance smock that doesn't deserve to eat here."}
{"text":"Karsen is the best industry bar in oldtown. The tuna sandwich is great too!!!"}
{"text":"Best bar in Old Town.  Incredibly friendly staff with delicious Tracy Dempsey desserts.  Always a great place to meet a character or two.  A couple of my food favorites beyond the desserts are the fresh made soups, any sandwich, and, of course, the nachos.  Really, you cannot go wrong.  They have a fun Sunday brunch and if you are in town for Spring Training this should be your first stop."}
{"text":"Great reasonably priced place! Good sandwiches the potato skins were good and my fish an chips was yummy!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  So tiny, so warm, so awesome!  Went there for lunch today. I had the pulled pork sandwich and my girlfriend had the brisket sandwich. Both were outstanding!  Also had the Green Mary Lou appetizer. Holy crap it was good!    As far as customer service, these people \"get it.\" They were genuinely happy that we were there and made us feel so welcome.  Friendly, warm, and attentive.    We left smiling, knowing that we had found another \"go to\" gem in Scottsdale!  Can't wait to go back again.  Maybe tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Checking reviews on Yelp, we decided to go to Karsen's Grill for lunch while in Scottsdale.  The outside was ok, inside you were in an old time bar.  The lady serving made you feel welcome immediately.  There was a mixture of tourists and locals having a lunch.  One man ordered the balogna sandwich, which I have not seen offered in a menu.  He was very pleased with it.  My husband & I had bbq pork and brisket sandwiches.  Excellant choies.  Both of us were very happy.  His side of potato salad was good as was my salad with a mixture of honey mustard/ranch dressing.  Glasses of soda and water were kept filled.  We were very happy we went here instead of the larger restaurants around.  Looking forward to coming back in the future."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Service was some of the best that we have ever had. Food was just as amazing as the service! Fish and chips were out of this world. Definitely recommend this as a must stop for everyone in the area."}
{"text":"Great place. Small joint but that adds to the character here. Food was amazing. Jalapeño club was excellent. Burger with fries was perfect and onion rings were hot and crispy.   Highly recommended. I will be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Cuban sandwich. Messy but great. And the sweet potato fries are lightly breaded, just right. We sat out front at one of the two patio tables. Beautiful day, very enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff in this small restaurant. The Philly Cheese Steak was awesome. Wasn't so thrilled about the Los Gigantes, a margarita made with Blood Orange. The honey mustard dressing has a strong sourness to it but it's not bad."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch; good food and fun atmosphere!  I had the Buffalo Chicken Salad and my companions had the Cuban Sandwich and French dip. All of it was excellent. This is a really small place and Scott was taking care of everything. He is like a really gregarious energizer bunny or just super funny and hyperactive. It works really well  will definitely return."}
{"text":"At first glance this place looks like a bar in a strip mall. It is so much more than that. The bartenders were great and had good recommendations on local beer/wines. I had the three cheese grilled cheese with bacon. Differently a great twist on a classic."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch. The Tostada Special with Chicken Salad, Black Beans and Sweet Corn and the Fish Tacos are a \"do not miss\"!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat! Salads and sandwiches are huge and so good! Come here every time we come to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Saw it on Yelp. Loved it!! I will be back often. Had the hot wings, frys, iced tea, and a lot of great service. It is a MUST in Old Town!!"}
{"text":"Great place for food and drinks. I found this place from reviews on Yelp. It is small and cozy and the staff is excellent. The food was good and they have a good selection of domestic and craft beers. I noticed there were quite a few regulars, and I can understand why. I'd definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This is a great bar.  Friendly people, attentive service,  good food, and the beer is always cold.  We come here every week for the last 2 years!"}
{"text":"The food and service was fantastic!  This is a definite do over!  We had the Cardiac Arrest and Chipotle BBQ burger.  Try the Mac and cheese sticks as well! YUM!"}
{"text":"Karsen's Grill is a great  little spot to go, their food  is great and most of the bartenders are friendly.   With the exception of one bartender I can't  which her name is Liz, she's such a cold fish.  Her attitude is she's doing you a favor by serving you.    I've been a frequent out-of-town customer and never a friendly welcome.   Conversations etc is to be about or evolved about her she doesn't take interest in anyone else,"}
{"text":"WOW! I cannot say enough great things about this place! I have been back on more than one occasion since the start of spring training & have tried something from every category on the menu.. & have LOVED every single thing. Everything comes out hot, fresh & looks as good as it tastes! And they don't hold back- you get very generous portions of everything! Can't beat their daily specials either! Great food, reasonable prices, & really good service. If you haven't been there GO & stop missing out on some of the best food in downtown Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were in Old Town Scottsdale looking for a place we haven't eaten at before. We stumbled upon Karsen's Grill, and checked out the menu. The 2 ladies working at the time, were very friendly, helpful and gladly answered any questions we had regarding the menu. At the table next to us, there was a lady and her daughter eating, and she was telling us about the food, and how good things are. One of ladies that was working mentioned \"We have the best Burgers in Old Town Scottsdale....\". I was wanting a light lunch, but Im also our family's resident \"Burger Expert\". CHALLENGE ACCEPTED! I ordered the Karsen's Burger, and my Wife ordered the Mary Lou. I couldn't stop looking at the food at the table next to us. It looked fantastic! A couple times I actually wondered if its really bad form to grab something off someone else's table and eat it. Food shows up, and we dig in. Wife is in a steady state of impersonating miss packman, so I had a good idea she was liking her plate. I took a bite of the Burger, and immediately had that \"cocked head\" look a dog has when its thinking. This burger was THE BEST I have had! Not greasy. Not seasoned to death. The bun toasted to perfection! As I devoured the burger, I turned to the fires. Fries are a funny thing, as every one has different taste. These were fried potatoes. Period. And crunchy. In other words.....PERFECT! Ive been eating burgers for 40 years. This place has been around for 20+ years. HOW have I not eaten here before? Doesn't matter! I found it now, and Im coming back!   Well done Karsen's! Thank you for an absolutely delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"Holy Moly!  Best Cuban sandwich I've ever had!! Thank you bartender Jim for the recommendation..   Never disappointed at Karsen's.."}
{"text":"Delightful, we were there for Sunday brunch. Great food, pleasant conversation and very reasonable.  Making a point to return for dinner."}
{"text":"Cute Place, Nice People, Great Food - Good Cactus League watching place! Great Burger & Pork Taco's"}
{"text":"Nice quaint bar with a small seating area. The food is extremely affordable and the portions of comfort food are large. Nice walk in the shopping area of Old Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very friendly. Great soup, decent sandwiches. Central location next to big public parking lot. A good Apple-cranberry crisp."}
{"text":"The guy working there was nice. Their food is not great at all. There is a full bar, which is nice. There is nothing on draft (all bottles). But they accept credit cards, so that is good."}
{"text":"Great food great service!! Our server Heidi was the friendliest server I've ever had, and she genuinely seemed to enjoy her work too! When we jokingly commented that we'd have the fries unless they miraculously had cheese curds hiding from us they actually said they'd been considering adding them to the menu and they had some in the back! This was a very unexpectedly great place that I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for awhile now. Best bar food in Old Town Hands!! Scott is da man! The MAC and cheese sticks are absolutely amazing! I tried the chipotle burger and like everything else I've tried.. amazing! Ask for Scott, he's the owner and usually behind the bar making jokes."}
{"text":"Great appetizer, the Green Mary Lou. Really good salads, Karsens Salad and Buffalo Chicken Salad. Small place, friendly service, all high tops, which is my reason for four stars and not five."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little restaurant!  My wife & I had lunch here and the service was excellent.  Highly recommend the Jalapeño Club & a salad with creamy avocado lime dressing."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this neighborhood bar. There's no signs of Ikea or strappy sandals around only flip flops, good food & tastey drinks. It's seriously the best neighborhood bar in all of the Phoenix area in my opinon. The service is attentive & nice. The food all tastes home made. I haven't tried the Sunday FREE breakfast buffet yet simply because I've either enjoyed Saturday too much & I'm still sleeping or someone has scraped me off of my bed too early for church. But one of these days I'm going to make it. Mark my words I'm going to make it. So if you can & are in the old town Scottsdale area stop by say hello to everyone & pull up a stool & watch some sports or just catch up with someone. If your agenda is chill, nosh & have a drink this is your place. Try the grape crush tall on the rocks. It's refreshing & goes down like grape koolaid. Now go & chill you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Was here for superbowl weekend. Loved the green mary lou, the black butte porter, and my wife fell in love with the bartender's blueberry lemonade. All good stuff in a tiny bar on a side street. I heard the other food is great too but didn't have a chance to try it all.   This place gets 5 stars for being more than what it is trying to be. Dive bar-ish but great food. Quick friendly service to locals and non locals alike. The bald bartender dude was very cool."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC in town on Vacation checked this place out... Because of yelp reviews and was not disappointed great food and great service. A+++"}
{"text":"Scott operates a fine place with really good, creative food and the friendliest service in Scottsdale. It sits directly across the street from Scottsdale's superb Farmers' Market on Saturdays on the north side of 1st Street (not to be confused with 1st  Avenue two blocks to the north). Tourists may not easily spot Karsen's on the south edge of Old Town, but it's well worth walking around a couple of corners to find.   My wife and I were there for the first time yesterday, and since we recently relocated nearby we plan to return often for their casual and tasty creations. Several of the customers seemed like regulars, and the whole atmosphere was jovial and welcoming.   One patron who was having lunch at the bar was joined a while later by a friend bringing him a grocery bag full of grapefruits harvested from her backyard. When we commented on the exchange, she offered to run home and bring us some as well. That's friendliness to strangers!   I had a really good pulled pork sandwich and a side of fresh potato salad. My wife had a veggie sandwich on extra fresh rye bread with perfectly ripe avocado, among other good, super-fresh  things. A couple at an adjoining table had the green chili stew and they told us that the gumbo and other homemade soups are their favorite things at Karsen's Grill. We hope those dishes are available on our next stop there.   Hats off to Scott for running a gem of a place in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot with a bar located on the outskirts of the turquoise triangle known as old town. Always quality food, specials are tasty, and won't put a hurt on your wallet. I am sure they get busier during spring training, but good to know that they are open all year."}
{"text":"Lived and worked in Old Town for years.  1st visit, awesome vibe, I felt like I walked into my hometown bar with the great welcome.  Food was great, service too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great easy going atmosphere. Jim is friendly and manages the bar as well as the tables. Try the veggie quesadilla or the Sunday burritto special. Not a lot of seats and easy to miss. Nice wine and beer selection, but could use some local brews."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place online and were intrigued by the photos. Hole in the wall place in old town Scottsdale, a hidden gem! Great customer service and awesome food. We got buffalo wings, salt & pepper wings, and the French dip sandwich. All 3 were excellent!!"}
{"text":"Yes this is a very very small bar that gets exceptionally loud...The food here more than makes up for that...SERIOUSLY...I've been coming here since 04, and the food and staff is absolutely fantastic!  The Green Mary Lou is a must have....The Queso Dip they serve is top notch!  All burgers, sandwiches and salads are way above average at a fair price for Scottsdale!  I absolutely love this little place! I'm all about flavor and quality when it comes to eating out and this place never fails.  If Heidi is working the experience is even better!  She's a superstar deluxe!"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary was good. Wings were nice and crispy, and waitress/bartender was super friendly. It was a little warm and door was open, would've stayed longer if a/c had been on. But all in all was a nice experience. Really small inside and only barstools to sit."}
{"text":"Such a great place! The wings are sooooo good! Service is amazing and Rocky is super friendly. Great atmosphere and it's like having dinner with your friends every time."}
{"text":"If you can call a place that's been around for over 20 years a hidden gem, then I guess that's a good description of Karsen's. If I hadn't met dayside bartender Heidi at another location I would never have known of this place and I've probably walked by it numerous times in the past.  Located on 1st Street in Old Town Scottsdale, Karsen's is a great place for comfort food like burgers, salads, soups, and patty melts. Karsen's also sports a full bar.  In addition to the food, the other item that's clearly kept Karsen's going all these years is the atmosphere. The staff and the owners clearly know and value their regulars and you can tell that the regulars reciprocate. Even going in as a new customer I was made to feel very welcome and that's the type of service that builds loyalty.  If you want a no-pressure, low key place to get food or drinks in Old Town Scottsdale, check out Karsen's Grill, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"For a small bar/grill in Scottsdale it's great. Ray is the owner/operator, very friendly, and wants to give good service. Give it a try. The burgers are delicious!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and outstanding service - you must try the 'Mary Lou'"}
{"text":"Best little pub in oldtown by far. Love the service and the atmosphere, will definitely be back here for a few more beers!"}
{"text":"Went to Karsen's Grill 2night on my \"Date Night\" w/my Wife 4 h.hour.Jimmy was behind the bar slinging drinks & serving food. Hands down,1 of the best deals on drinks & food ANYWHERE in Old Town! DO NOT pass up 1 of the best locally owned bar /restaurants in the whole city!"}
{"text":"Karsen's Grill is a little joint tucked away in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale that makes food that will change your life.  The staff is friendly and extremely helpful with navigating this delicious, mouth watering menu that is simple but changes from time to time due to the chef's creative imagination.  I had the Southwest Cardiac burger that is now on my top 5 burgers I've had.  The choice of ingredients in all of their burgers and sandwiches are perfectly matched and come together like a ballet of flavors that is discribed simply as....perfect.  They have a small bar with friendly bartenders that pour nicely.  This is a small place with BIG TIME food!  A must when you are in the area."}
{"text":"I discovered this place while walking around told town.  Great spot in the heart of Old Town.  Had a great brisket sandwich and potato salad.  The only draw back is that it is set up like a bar.  There is minimal seating outside.  The seating outside is dry.  Great old though!"}
{"text":"Under promises and over delivers!  Truly homemade, delicious chow. Not your usual pub grub. Yup, it' s a tiny hole in the wall.  But it' really big on service and excellent adult beverages. Nice surprise was Tracy Dempsey desserts top off the Monday Night Pork Chop Special. Yum. We'll be back. Soon."}
{"text":"Perfect local bar wi great food and excellent staff. We met the owners who were having fun with the customers. Heidi, the bartender whips up some great summer drinks. Try the homemade pineapple infused vodka, it taste like pure in rapper juice...watch out, it creeps up quickly.  Tried the homemade bloody Mary mix.omg...fabulous. The food was really good too. We had the homemade quest dips with fresh chips, French dip was outstanding (au jus, green chile, map,e bacon, prime rib and Boursin), did I already say it was to die for.  We also tried the wings, teriyaki and buffalo....yummy.  I give it 4.5 stars because it doesn't have much ambience but the crowd clearly hangs out there a lot"}
{"text":"Tried a salad here to-go and it ended up being pretty good. Some of the lettuce was a bit rough around the edges, but the topping were first class. The chicken chunks were very plentiful and the avocado, corn and other veggies were of good quality. The dressing was a key to the modest success of the salad. The salad was 10 bucks, but in hindsight, although decent, stick to the sandwiches next time. The menu has changed also, it seems much more limited now."}
{"text":"This place is small but the drink selection and food were pretty good. I would come here again but for drinks and appetizers. It can get pretty loud but the place is fun. There was only one server who was also the bartender. 4 stars over all..."}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch here based on reviews. We were the only people there when we walked in. Girl behind the counter didn't even acknowledge us. We just stood there for a minute feeling really awkward. Finally decided to go elsewhere. Somewhere that actually wanted our business."}
{"text":"Just browsing around scottsdale, and came in Karsens  Grill. Had the Buffalo wings which where off the chain delicious. Quesadilla was the best I've had in a looong time. Great costumer service, friendly atmosphere.  Just as the signs says:  \"If good things come in small packages,then Karsens is your kinda place\". Will definitely  be back. Keep it up guys !"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com! If you haven't been here, you should definitely try it out. It's a very small bar but great atmosphere and the owner Rocky is the man! How many bars do you go to on a Friday night and get to be served by the owner?!? You can here! The food is on point.. If you want to hit up a small little towny bar without people giving you that \"you don't belong here look\", go here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in since we were in the area...the cuban pork sandwich was amazing!  First bite was good, second bite was delish, third bite was heaven.  Got a winner on that one.  Fun, friendly I would go back."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I had a quesadilla with veggies and it was fantastic. Perfect family lunch spot. My little brother got the wings and he loved them, but wished they had something a little spicier.   The drinks are cheap. The food is a smokin deal!"}
{"text":"HOLY DIVE BAR HEAVEN! I don't know how I grew up and live just minutes away without hearing about Karsen's OR have not come across it on Yelp yet! {Their reviews speak for themselves.} I was in the area, starving, and wanting to try something new so I whipped out my handy dandy Yelp app and came across this hidden gem!   It is a tiny, dark, fab little spot. I ordered their club and it was literally the best club that i've ever had in my life. From the buttery melt-in-your-mouth sourdough, to the crispy bacon, ham, turkey, avocado, candied jalapenos, jalapeno cream cheese, and more it was just a heavenly sandwich that I haven't stopped raving about {or craving} since I left. ALSO - THEIR HAND CUT FRIES. You guys, these are some of the best fries that i've ever had in my life! They're thick cut and seasoned to perfection. Pro Tip: They also have dreamy ranch, if you're a ranch fanatic like me! My husband had their Friday special which was the Panko crusted + parmesan fish and chips. He also said they were phenomenal.   We will absolutely be back! My dad LOVES dive bars so I can't wait to bring him here!! It is also worth mentioning that the service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"When Rocky, et al. assumed ownership of Old Town stalwart Karsen's Grill, they kept the name because there isn't anything wrong with it. Without an ounce of ego between the three of them--Rocky, Scott, & Chef Kenny--they've crafted an experience where there is an instant camaraderie among whoever walks in the door: \"Oh you're here too?\"   Everything that comes out of the kitchen is unexpectedly delicious, and every drink is poured--without the typical ounce-counting bottle caps--by an agreeable bartender.  I'm only there a handful of times per year, but it is always worth it."}
{"text":"How this place has these reviews is beyond me. It's a small bar. No character. Food was terrible, the kind of nachos I'd expect to get in Poland.  Awful. Avoid."}
{"text":"Casual pub in old town, service has always been good and personable.  On the few recent occasions that I've come on a weeknight one of the owners was tending bar and made sure he introduced himself and knew the names of all the customers.  Food was good, drinks worked, nice casual old town hangout."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant!! I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was really good. Service was great! Everyone was so friendly. Fun place to hang out or grab something quick. Seating is limited!"}
{"text":"Great fish & chips! Found them on Yelp & liked all the reviews so went over with a girlfriend last night. The fish was fresh & flaky, the french fries were REAL, & the bartender was friendly & the service was great. The location is great in Old Town Scottsdale, and as a new person in town I know it will be a place where I can go alone and feel very comforable. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Karsen's Grill....this place is amazing. From the moment we walked in the door we were greeted with an enthusiastic \"Hi, welcome...what can we get you?\" There's not much seating, but it's the most comfortable place to grab a bite to eat and a couple of drinks. Heidi was our bartender and did more than an amazing job.....I recommend the grape crush shot, truly delicious. I had the special which was a burger with a green chili cheese sauce that was probably the best thing I've put in my mouth in the past week. We will definitely be back, we've found a new staple in Old Town."}
{"text":"I actually just placed an order for pick up.  The place was packed and kind of cramped, but my food was ready as promised right on time.  I got a chicken sandwich and a burger - 19.06, ouch!  The burger was a bit bland.  The meat was pretty good, but just needed a little seasoning.  The onion roll and accompaniments were standard.  The steak fries were definitely done right - not one of them was limp and not crispy.  The spicy chicken sandwich was very good.  I liked this a lot better than the burger.  The coleslaw I got as a side for it though was bland and watery.    All in all, its got a hefty price tag but ingredients are good and food is cooked right.  Nothing a little salt won't fix.  Place gets packed but the service seems very good considering."}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that this is a tiny bar dissuaded you from coming hwre. The food here is fucking good! I was really shocked by the quality of the food. I ordered a french dip with steak cut fries. All the sandwitches and nurfers come with a side. The french dip was amazing and had a horshradish sauce on the top which was really unique. Full of flavor and delicious. The fries were well seasoned and really filling. I also got a chance to try my friend's salt and pepper wings which were amazing. I loved the portion sizes. The service is great and very helpful. I'm not from the area, but if I was I would definetly return."}
{"text":"Has their French dip. Absolutely delicious! They add crisp bacon and green chile to their delicious shaved beef. I added jalapeños for an extra bam! Definitely will return"}
{"text":"Karsen's grill is a great venue in Old Town to escape from the tourist vibe. It has that nice dive appeal dim lighting, generous pours, and a friendly atmosphere. Menu is pretty extensive for such a small bar. They have daily specials and plenty of comfort food on their menu. I had their meatloaf special and it was a very generous portion and very reasonably priced.  Be aware that if you are anti-social then this is not the place for you as conversation amongst the patrons is bountiful ;^). Karsen's Grill is definitely on my return to list when I'm I return to PHX!"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken wings and bartender poured a generous glass of wine.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Well I know this place has new owners they open at 10 am on Sunday for brunch offering a Buffet And a special wife chose the Buffet ,biscuits and gravy ,eggs, bacon, sausage ,potatoes ....1025am biscuits not ready hmmm ok potatoes not hot eggs ok bacon beyond well done ..... I had the poutine which was good service was good and friendly ........ I will certainly go back for lunch .... I think lunch and dinner my be more to my liking...."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and our server was 5. My fiancé had the bologna sandwich. He loved it! If we lived in Scottsdale he would be back at least once a week for it. I had a cup of cream of cheddar and broccoli soup for my snack and that's where they loose a star. It was SO salty! I only had 1/2 the CUP to be nice but really should've sent it back."}
{"text":"Small intimate place with friendly staff. I ordered a Scottsdale Salad which had a very nice homemade honey mustard dressing. The chicken was slightly dry and over cooked. All beers are in the bottle with a full bar"}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was pretty bad. Basically, if you're a regular you are greeted with hugs and special treatment. If not, you're pretty much forgotten about!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a bar that makes you feel like family, then this is the place to be. Small and cozy with an great beer selection and even better food menu.   I highly recommend the Teriyaki chicken sandwich. It was mouth watering and to die for. I wish I had room for more. I would of ordered a second one."}
{"text":"I love love love this great little bar. Plenty of close parking and that's a big deal in old Scottsdale. Food is awesome, huge variety of beer."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and just wandered in. Great service and French Dip sandwich and steak fries were really good. I would come here anytime."}
{"text":"Scotty is a funny bartender, great little hidden bar in Old town that isn't overpriced for food. I do miss Kenny's food specials however."}
{"text":"Fabulous fun small place with excellent bar and fantastic menu. Salads, dogs and sandwiches are all good. Atmosphere is cozy, friendly and fun!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes based on the YELP photos of food and reviews, but sometimes it's all bogus. Oh well this small Old Town Scottsdale bar is a nice watering hole but the food is tasty but not stellar based on photos. Most of the items posted on Yelp weren't even available to purchase so be warned before coming in.  Ok , so I did sample a few items. Chili was interesting and tasty yet it was more soupy than a chili. FYI order a cup it's a large serving. Buffalo wings very good with a nice kick to them so you won't be disappointed. However the Mac n Cheese deep fried sticks were a bust. Didn't taste very good with green glow to them. Something I'd skip if you want Franks thoughts on the matter.  Bar is few blocks from the San Fransisco Giants spring training stadium so you can cocktail it up before or after the game. I'm sure you'll find the place a cool hangout but my thoughts are the cuisine wasn't stellar.   *** Note the help was exceptional and the lady running the bar was outstanding , helpful and very attentive to our needs. Bravo"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy, best fish and chips in town, great Bloody Mary too! My husband enjoyed his burger and nothing here to break the bank!"}
{"text":"Very very good food! Large portions. Great homemade fries! We tried the teriyaki chicken sandwich, the burger, and the French dip - all were excellent! Great little place, friendly staff, has limited indoor and outdoor seating - great bargain for your money!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for introducing us to Karsen's! Had an amazing lunch today - Green Mary Lou was great, and some of the BEST green chile enchilada soup I've ever tasted!! Very friendly staff/owners, and nice hidden gem. Small spot, but definitely worth trying (again and again)!!"}
{"text":"Found it by strolling through Old Town, liked the look/feel from the outside and peeked in and like it even more.  Mah/pop joint for 22 years the last 19 by same two partner's.  Very friendly bartender and server/owner greeted us immediately, as sat ourselves in this small quaint lil joint, most accompanied by locals, but did have the usual tourist of which we are.  Full bar, menu of usual bar/grill fare, but we dug it.  A club sammy and the special today, the pulled pork sammy.  Both solid, not too anything including grease or sauce so that was nice.  Great steak cut fries and potato salad to match.  Bottomless soda and iced tea.  Great place regularly checking back if we wanted anything, if it was to our liking and offering to top off our drinks.  We understand the desert is bomb, but didn't have any room for it.    Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hole in the wall off the beaten path in Old Town Scottsdale.  And if you're like me, you hate the social scene of Old Town.  But, every now and then you end up there.  This place is a great retreat from the Affliction body spray and fist pumping that is everywhere else in this neck.  I walked in and I met 3 other people who listened to Widespread Panic.  One of them was a female.  Very impressive!  The radio was a nice mix of Grateful Dead, Widespread, Black Crowes, and other jam bands.  Think I've found my new favorite bar.  I don't remember prices really as some guy there kept buying everyone shots.  I stumbled out happy.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood bar and grill.  Friendly and good service, great food, I had the daily special and companion had the Philly cheese steak, plenty of good side choices not just the usual fries.  Food was great, atmosphere was friendly and they acted like they were real glad you came in."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon hoping to eat decent bar food. Much to our surprise, this small, homey bar exceeded all of our expectations. We ordered the Green Mary Lou appetizer which was very good. My wife ordered the portobello sandwich which she absolutely devoured and I ordered the Karsen's Burger which was delicious as well.   The service was top notch and I found it amusing, yet extremely satisfying that the patron gave us a \"play by play\" countdown on when each dish would be coming out to be served.  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Tiny little (I guess that's redundant) bar and grill that seems to have a regular following and serves simple, yet tasty food at a decent price.  Stopped in late one night.  Well maybe it was 9 or so, but that's late for me.  I went with the turkey philly spike style (jalapeño and green chiles) and potato salad.  The potato salad (house-made) was pretty good, and I'm extremely hard to please with that.  The philly was better than I expected considering it was smoked turkey and not ribeye, and the jalapeño and chiles definitely made it better!  I can't remember the name of the guy working that evening, but he was awesome.  Even though he was tasked with both tending bar and waiting tables, actually one table, he was on top of things and made us feel like regulars.  In fact, I'm wondering now why I haven't been back.  Will have to rectify that soon!"}
{"text":"The older man with the goatee and the hat gave me a shitty look as soon as I walked in and again after I nicely and politely asked for the food and beer menu. Then he pointed me to the wall and said all our beers are there on the ledge, and walked away   I don't take bs, so I simply walked out and will never return"}
{"text":"Excellent little gem of a neighborhood restaurant! Their sandwich bread is amazing and their sandwiches are huge! The main bartender/waiter who was there on Monday was the friendliest guy and made us feel welcome the minute we walked in the door. This place is tiny, but what it lacks in space it makes up for with the food! I highly recommend this grill to anyone in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"Everyone is right that this place is (very) tiny and friendly.  However, the service is a little slow, and the food just isn't that great.  I mean, Yelp's \"A-OK\" description about sums it up.  Nothing awful, but nothing awesome either.  My friend tried their signature dish, the Mary Lou.  Again, nothing great.  It was okay, but we were expecting something in the burrito style, and it came out more like a quesadilla.  Also, the flavor of the machaca beef was okay, but I've definitely had way better.  And yes, I would say that the Mary Lou would feed two people pretty well.  Basically, I am not sure if I would go back.  It is rare that I am so entirely ambivalent about a food place, but this place (un)inspires it."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp. Food was amazing! Price was just right. Nice little spot in Downtown Scottsdale. The bartender/waiter was attentive but not intrusive.  Came for a spring training trip with the fellas and this was arguably one spot where we all said we'd come back too. It's a super small place that holds maybe 25 people or so. It has a New Port Beach/Huntington Beach feel with the music and decor. I ordered the wings and fries, wow! Wings were perfectly cooked and the fries were amazing! If I'm back in Scottsdale, I'll make sure I eat here again."}
{"text":"Great little place with better than avg. burgers and awesome french fries.  What really stood out, though, is the awesome customer service.  Super nice staff!  Makes you kind of feel like you're at home.  They tease you and mess around light heartedly.  Very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"This is a small bar and grill located in Old Town. I decided to order take out and seeing the 4.5 stars it made my decision up. The pictures of the food look great so let's do it!  I went to the website but the menu page wasn't working so I had to search it down on fb. Most of the picture of food weren't on the menu.  I wouldn't have thought every pictures would be just the special of that particular day, but what do I know.  I ordered the Coney and side salad with no onions. My husband ordered the Chipotle Bbq burger. They get less stars because: 1. The menu had to be hunted down.  2. I ordered my food without onions and instead, I got a smothering of them. Not only do I despise their crunch, but anything they touch, tastes like onions.  3. My Coney had GOBS of mustard. It was disgusting and tried to scoop some of it off.   The burger was rated ok. Nothing bad, but nothing noteworthy.   Alas, our search for pick up burgers continue..."}
{"text":"Friendly and small bar/food. Great drinks and the food was good. We shared the Mac and cheese with smoked chicken and bacon!! Delicious and next time we will each get our own!!"}
{"text":"We just recently moved to Old Town Scottsdale and for the last 6 months have been making the rounds of all the bars and restaurants in the area.  We walked by this place last night and it perfectly fits our MO - small, personal and they sell cold beer.  Sat down and got the a very cold Bud Light which is a great start.  Its surprising how many bars don't know the importance here and these guys did.  The price is a little above average which is surprising given the basic nature of this place.  We struck up a conversation with the bartender and for half a beer I thought we had found a place that would be on the permanent rotation.  Unfortunately it went south in a hurry.  The bartender who is also one of the owners turned out to be at best a pompous ass.  It was so bad my wife got up and walked out and left a third of her beer - yes we went from 100 to minus 10 in less than a quarter of a beer - about 3 minutes. Comically the bartender was looking at me like \"what did I do?\".  I have owned and operated many customer facing businesses including bars, restaurants and resorts and my current company caters specifically to the best hospitality businesses around the US.  I personally serve as a consumer advisor to two major hotel chains and one airline.  When a customer tells you something they are proud of, you don't degrade and demean it.  You accomplish nothing by trying to make yourself look good at their expense.  This situation actually started pretty benign as we asked the guy about his history with the bar and how long he had been in Arizona.  I commented my wife was a native and she added she was a 4th generation native.  Somehow this guy took that personal and went on a rant about why that didn't mean shit.  \"I went to such and such elementary school, this middle school, this high school and SCC so what is so great about being a native.\"  That is just one quote.  The diatribe didn't stop.  Quite honestly I was dumbfounded it was so inappropriate.  When this Gen Xer gains a little more maturity what hopefully goes through his head the next time someone tells him they are a 4th generation Arizonan is 1.  This person probably has a VERY big group of friends and family and 2. I should probably at a minimum not degrade them so they give us a good recommendation.  Clearly that filter between your brain and your mouth has not totally developed here.  The good news / bad news is I have 8 bars around the country where they hand me what I drink before I order.  My wife and I are two of the best customers those 8 places have and we are out almost every night.  I personally have been in Arizona since 1971 and have a huge group of friends and business associates garnered over all those years.  My wife's family goes back to 1917 and also has a huge group of friends.  Given there were only 2 other people in the place while we were there, I don't know how well they are doing but they aren't maxed out by any means so I am guessing they would appreciate additional businesses.  They won't get any referrals from us and worse we will likely tell this negative story as we make the rounds and discourage anyone we know from going there.  We will not ever go back.  If we are looking for a dive bar, we will make our way to Patty's two streets over where the bartenders are personable and mature and the beers are 33% cheaper.  If we want a little more upscale experience we will go to Old Town Tavern where the owner is awesome and is more concerned with his customers than himself."}
{"text":"Mediocre is a compliment for what my family and I just ate. And $98 later for two adults and two kids? I hope the bar flys are buying a lot of Budweiser because we will never be back."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its Yelp reviews. Had the Cuban Sandwich and Zucchini. Fantastic!  Rocky the owner is very polite and friendly. Large portions. Had to take most to go."}
{"text":"Are we glad we stopped by yesterday ( Sat. ) afternoon !  Decided to have lunch ; Sarah told us about the special : Meatball Parm sand. Best  I've had since I don't know when....the sauce was unusually good , considering this is not Karsen's typical fare !  Lucky us !  ( oh yeah....Rocky showed up )....."}
{"text":"The food was very good ! The bartenders ....I have only been in this area 24 hours but if this is how the customers are treated, this town should be embarrassed. I work for a very successful company where we treat customers like family. Here we were treated like a an imposition."}
{"text":"Really good casual food. Burger was great fried pickles awesome. Heidi is a gem, pleasant and on top of everything. Nice local flavor with good prices."}
{"text":"Very close and friendly staff that definitely seems to care about their customers. Food is definitely made by an artist that cares about quality. I will no doubt return to this place"}
{"text":"Wow. You absolutely MUST try the fries. Blew us away. The nachos were great as well and barely a chip was left uncovered with cheese. The salsa was so good as well and I am partial to my own homemade salsa so this is a true compliment.   The menu is small but has a nice and unique selection of items, so much so that we know we will be coming back to try everything!   Look, my first order was: the nachos, a side of fries, AND a Jalapeño Club to go. To go. I ordered food to go before even eating my main meal. What? Yes. It is that good."}
{"text":"Great local \"joint\" with the friendliest bartender ever and great food, too! Get the Nachos with the Machaco Beef. We were full and very happy. Only sad thing was to leave so soon!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place I thought we may have made a mistake. 6 small tables and an eight seater bar. Kinda dark and very bar-like. The Jimmy came over and immediately made us feel welcome. There is a lot that I can talk about but there is one thing that makes everything else meaningless. The French Dip here is probably the most amazing sandwich I've  had in years. Each bite gave me a mini \"O\" and I crave more. I saddened as each bite vanished in my mouth but then immediate rejoiced as the beef juices reached my taste buds. When I finished my mouthed longed for another but my stomach was screaming for me to stop. I am not joking. I would light punch a sleeping baby in the stomach if it meant I could have one of these French dips. If you have a layover in Phoenix you need to break FAA rules, run out through security and get to Scottsdale. You don't want to miss this."}
{"text":"Great little place with lots of charm and character.  Staff was very friendly and personable, food was tasty and prices were reasonable.  Good value.  Our family had a great meal here!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos are to die for. Amazing service and amazing staff. Will be back soon. Maybe even tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. We ordered the pull pork sandwich and the Scottsdale salads. Both items were flavorful. We had wonderful service and sat outside on the patio. We would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a local spot."}
{"text":"First time in Scottsdale, drove into old town, downtown and found this little gem thanks to Yelp!  A big thank you Yelpers!  The owners are so awesome, the food is delicious, the atmosphere is super cool and relaxed. If you're a foodie and looking for something to try, swing by this place."}
{"text":"If I wasn't a local (I am), and I was looking for somewhere great to eat, this would be the place I would want to know about. I'm not sure how we've gone almost 2 years living here without eating at Karsen's, but my life and my taste buds will never be the same!   This place most definitely is your dream dive bar- friendly service (our waiter/bartender was amazing), great food, and great vibe. The place is small, and best suited for small groups (Maybe 10 tables in the whole place) but totally worth it!   We split the fried mac & cheese bites, I had the Karsen's Kuban and my boyfriend had the Southwest Cardiac- He swears the burger was the best burger he had ever had, and my Kuban was amazing.   Overall, we've decided Karsen's Grill is our new hangout spot and we can't wait to eat our way throughout the entire menu!"}
{"text":"We were touring Old Town Scottsdale when we ran across this small, friendly bar and grill. We stopped in for a drink, and were very pleased with the atmosphere, the service, and the drinks."}
{"text":"The owner is extremly friendly. Great place as all the other Yelpers have said. I ordered the Blackened chicken sandwich with patato salad. Not too spicy, but just right. The patato salad was extremly good. If your out and about in the afternoon looking for lunch, stop in here."}
{"text":"Ugh soo disappointing! Ordered Cajun chicken salad but got the Buffalo chicken instead. Ordered takeout and didn't check it before leaving! It's okay tho cuz I *almost* ordered the Buffalo chicken salad anyway. Well, the chicken was hella dry and bland except for the buffalo sauce. I also ordered the Cuban sandwich which was okay. Too much BBQ sauce. Why do they call it a Cuban sandwich? It's more like a BBQ sandwich with a slice of ham. The pickles in it were good and I liked the bread."}
{"text":"Karsen's Grill is the greatest little joint in Scottsdale.  Fabulous burgers, great sandwiches and surprisingly good salads.  It's really small, but you'll feet like an old-timer on your first visit.  Very pleasant staff.   I used to live live in Scottsdale and was a regular customer.  I miss Karsen's Grill!"}
{"text":"Owner was very involved and friendly. Sandwiches are very good and a little different spin on old favorites.  Lunch was busy, but not packed. Friendly atmosphere, very casual."}
{"text":"Great at home feel. Yummy food and great service. It's a small place but the food, drinks and service are great! Highly recommend any of Heidi's drink suggestions. I had a cucumber blueberry vodka lemonade and it was amazing. Also tried the food special which was a corn breaded burger with a bunch of toppings served on lettuce. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and warm, friendly servers.  Heidi is awesome! Thank you for making us feel very welcome !"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this little place. Awesome food, great margaritas, friendly service. We had a party of 7 with a few prone to giving any server a hard time, but she took everything with a smile and never let anything bother her. She kept our drinks full and gave us great food recommendations. None of us left unhappy with what we ordered - everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Who wants a hug? I do!   That was my reply to our friendly waitress. This place is a small bar with better than expected food and like the other reviews say good service. It's amazing how much sincere, friendly service can make beer taste colder and sandwiches better. Karsen's is now part of the Scottsdale routine."}
{"text":"Picture old, ripped Miller Light posters, dusty bottles, and stories being passed among friends. Just like out of a movie. Add in some diner tables and a few bar stools. A little dark, but friendliest staff anywhere and burgers and wings were worth going in. The burgers are huge and everyone was eating one. Seems everyone knew everyone so we just watched the magic and ate our food and drank $3 beer.  Its in the Western area of Old Town, I mean you can jump out the door and get on a horse and carriage ride, which is more fun half tanked and I know this."}
{"text":"First timers. Expected a larger venue and was quite surprised at its \"small town feel \".  Had the tuna melt and my husband has the club. Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. Did I say excellent?  Love this place even more so because they serve Deschutes. Not a regular visitor to Old Town Scottsdale but will come back when we're here.  Heidi and Jim made us very welcome."}
{"text":"One of our personal favorites on the menu is the Green Mary Lou. If you have never heard of one (don't worry, we didn't either) the Green Mary Lou is an extra large flour tortilla stuffed with Queso Dip, topped with Karsen's fabulous homemade Machaca Beef, green chili sauce and Cheddar & Jack Cheese. Wow. But we warn you, it's definitely a meal so come hungry! During the summer, the Green Mary Lou is one of the Cool Summer Specials and at $5, it leaves money still in your wallet for that adult beverage!  See our complete review here... http://schmoozeaz.com/blog/?p=802"}
{"text":"We went here based on the reviews and weren't disappointed! Food was amazing and service was spot on! Heidi, the bartender was super helpful and accommodating!"}
{"text":"This place was very interesting. The bf and I came in after having dinner earlier. The bartender was very friendly, she reminded me of Kate hudsons character in Almost Famous. She kind of pushed us into tequila shots but I definitely didn't put up a fight and had a good time."}
{"text":"Karsen's is a great laid back bar. Everyone (staff and patrons) is very friendly so it has the neighborhood pub vibe. Attention Scottsdale DBs...please do not come here. You will not like it and the regulars don't care."}
{"text":"Karsen's Grill has the best bar food in Scottsdale! Make sure to try the fried pickles and MAC n' Cheese sticks!!!   Can't wait to come back to Scottsdale and eat there again!!"}
{"text":"I loved this little hole in the wall.  It is so tiny we almost missed it, but I was definitely worth it to turn around and try again.  When you first walk in you think it is a bar First and foremost; there are maybe four or five or so bar tables with stools inside.  Only two small 4-too tables outside.  But the Yelp reviews on the food told us to give it a try, and so glad we did.  Two of us got the Jalapeño club, the other got the French Dip.  Sooooo yummy.  Potato salad (okay), sweet potato fries (interesting, with a little bit of sweet stuff on top), and steak fries (cooked to perfection).  The bartender/server Scott was a delight.  If I'm back in town I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I must have walked past this place hundreds of times before I even knew it was there.  I was invited here for a meeting of a local pet welfare group I'm involved with.  Our meeting was a small group, so this place was perfect.    Great location, great food, great prices and great service.  They even have a $5 food menu.  Cons - Very small.  Seats maybe 20 people."}
{"text":"3.5 stars Super, super small place. They only have bottled beer and no drink specials. The bartender also waited our table - he was an older gentleman who was very friendly and entertaining. The service was fast, and the food was pretty good. The appetizer was $2 off (food special) so it was worth it. If you're in the mood for a small bar with reasonably priced and reasonably tasting food, this place is worth visiting. I would have given this place 4 stars if they had better drinks/drink specials.   Appetizer: Green Mary Lou: reminded me of a crispier, thicker quesadilla. A little heavy and greasy but really good! Would have gone really well with a dark beer.  Entrees: 1) Karsen's Burger: simply dressed burger, but the meat was pretty good 2) Portobello veggie sandwich which was stacked!"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are incredible! Wick was our bartender/sever and was super friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. He definitely added to the family feel of the place"}
{"text":"OK OK OK seriously this place is the bomb Rocky who is the bartender and co-owner is one chill dude. The food is fantastically freaking amazing. If you do not try the french fries then someone shoudl slap your mamma.Also the chicken wings with just salt n pepper are to die for. I live in south central Phx and have been back 4 times in one month. Absolute home run for upgraded \"bar food\""}
{"text":"Solid bar food, just be aware it is a very small place."}
{"text":"Great little bar with good food. Service was top notch from both our bartenders as we came in during shift change over. We will be back, next time we'll have to ride our beach cruisers up!   Club Sandwich was HUGE!"}
{"text":"Rocky was great! Recommended the jalapeño club wrap to my friend (devoured it). I had the club with blackened chicken which was super fresh and yummy! Also the chicken noodle soup is so creamy and yummy!"}
{"text":"Funny and attentive bartender, strong drinks and amazing made to order burgers, mac n cheese and the best hand cut and made sweet potato fries you can get in the state. We love stopping in here!"}
{"text":"Check out the new menu, best of the best remains, with some great new goodies. Heidi is the best and Rocky is doing a great job of keeping it real...plus adding some great atmosphere Keep it up folks. Best little Bar and Grill on the planet...I should know...I travel the whole  world"}
{"text":"Place was good. Very friendly owners. Menu was good if you're looking to stay with a familiar territory. I could defintely tell this was a place many regulars go. We found John to be a very nice guy."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place got the reviews it did.  Our waitress was really nice but our food (pork tacos) tasted like crap.  Our drinks were store margarita mix.  I guess I'm use to real hand mixed margaritas and tacos from real Mexican places.  Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Don't expect the ambiance to win you over here.  It's a small bar with about 10-15 chairs around the bar and a hand full of tables in the bar area.  The staff is as friendly as the guests and it is just a laid-back place off the beaten path.  I enjoy seeking refuge here after attending festivals in the Civic Center in the hot weather."}
{"text":"Most reviewers like Karsen's food -- and so did I.  The patty melt was fresh and tasty, the rueben was just as a rueben should be, and my bottled beer ... well it was bottled beer.  The service was pleasant and reasonably prompt.  So why just three stars?  It's not just that the French fries were soggy.  Clue #1 - Our server was the bartender.  Clue #2 - We were not sitting at the bar.  It doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to figure out that Karsen's must be a very small place.  Indeed it is, with six small tables inside, and about eight seats at the bar.  So what's wrong with that? --- Nothing.  Throughout Spain and Italy bars like this are the main places people go for quick meals.  But Karsen's takes small to a new level.  For example, there are no draft beers.  For example, from your table you get a view of a long untidy corrider leading to the back of the building.  For example, your one seating option is a bar stool.  In the end, Karsen's feels a bit like a third world beer joint, slightly upgraded, and with food much better than one would expect at such a place.  Three stars -- that's just about right."}
{"text":"I loved their customer service!' Prob one of the best!! When my friend and I walked in it was dead but the bartender (I believe the owner) greeted us and throughout our stay he was so nice! We never had a prob having an empty water cup! The food was good too. I got the burger and it tasted like the ones u can make at your house! Very tasty."}
{"text":"since introduced to KG's over 10 years ago (by Big Pete of Oregano's) i've been a huge fan and always sure to visit when i'm in town. stopping by is like visiting an old friend (the place is uber small) where you say hi to John or TR behind the bar and they remember you.  a little (pun intended) description: its a small bar that serves OK food (burgers and the like). very basic TV's. Most importantly, its where your likely to find yourself making new friends. It's frequented by local restaurant owners and staff (front and back of house), professional baseball umpires and other interesting folks."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the food or drinks because we couldn't eat here due to the stools being too high for my little girl to sit on. The staff was extremely friendly though for offering to set up a low table for us outside. I thought that was incredibly nice of them. It looked like a great place. I hope to try it someday when I don't have my daughter with me."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday for lunch I was the only one there and sat at the bar. The bartender was super friendly and nice and made a really good Bloody Mary. It was pretty spicy and had a few olives and a cucumber and lime which was nice. I ordered a BLT and fries. The fries were excellent. They were steak fries and really hot and crispy. The sandwich was not the best thing I've ever had. The marble rye was nicely toasted but the bacon was just a little too hard. I would come back and try a different sandwich or a dessert.  The bartender mentioned the desserts are made by a famous phoenix baker.  Overall reasonably priced and have a friendly staff."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  Great food and a cool atmosphere!  I'll be back for sure!  Queso is bomb! Fries are fresh and tasty!  Rocky is the man."}
{"text":"did a pickup for lunch today, ordered the cuban and it was delish!!!  will be back"}
{"text":"Came across this while walking Old Town Scottsdale.  We were having trouble finding a place open for a late lunch at 3pm, so we picked this. The bartender is the server and the inside seating is all bar stools and high tables so this is not the best place for comfort.  We both ordered chesseburgers that were fantastic.  They have a few TV's on with sports and the staff was very friendly.  I would suggest this if you want a burger and don't mind sitting on bar stools.  I do think there were tables outside but we did not chose to sit outside."}
{"text":"Really great food & friendly staff. Scott was especially helpful with menu selections & customer service. Excellent burgers and sandwiches with fresh breads & ingredients. Good place to watch sports."}
{"text":"last min option when you really don't have a whole lotta time ...... its a great place. friendly staff fast service for being a sports local pub tavern kinda place in the heart of oldtown and also convienient because its right next door to the salon where I work. win win...."}
{"text":"We used to go here a lot years ago. But a move north a bit took it out of the flight path so... it was time to go back and check it out.  As always.... the owner/bartender/waiter/janitor/greeter was doing his thing running around and keeping us in drinks and food.  The drinks were good a always (no short pours here that i've had) and the food great. i didn't have but the burgers were big and juicy looking and the salad with cajun chicken was great. BEST honey mustard dressing i ever had.  Anyhow, glad i went and will be back sooner. It's small, with 6 tables and the 10 seat bar but... close friends and fun can be found here.  ENJOY IT.... and worth the trip for this small almost out of the way place.  I'd give it 5 stars but it was a bit noise (part of the charm except when you're trying to talk) and our waitress could have been better looking.  :-)  (sorry John)"}
{"text":"quiet little bar. really small and cozy. friendly bartender that makes yummy drinks :) kind of hidden on a side street but walking distance from all the other bars and clubs in scottsdale."}
{"text":"Our first time to Old Town Scottsdale & found this little hole in the wall...it was great! Our waitress was friendly & helpful. We ordered the pulled pork tacos (delicious!) & hamburger special. Everything was flavorful & well prepared. Super small place, but I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Southwest Jalapeno Burger and the wife ordered Chicken Strips w/sweet potato fries.  All the meat is purchased through a local butcher and bread through a local baker!  Tiny place, great big food.  Burger was delicious, forgot photo.  Wife loved her chicken as well.  Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"In town for a weekend and came upon this place based on Yelp reviews. Small little place but it was amazing. The staff are so friendly and the service was amazing. I had the French dip, which was so yummy and my friend had the grilled cheese. I love that the staff asked our names and struck up friendly conversation without being Annoying. Plus the prices were great! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. Don't skip the Cuban sandwich with potato salad or anything they're serving with their green chile pork... To die for. The owner Ricky is a character, bartenders and staff all very friendly and attentive. They always greet you with a smile and remember what you're drinking. Best dive bar on Old Town!"}
{"text":"The Monday Night Pork Chop Special (MNPCS) was really good, as were the mashed potatoes! My mates tried the Turkey Ruben and the Club Sandwich - both were said to be quite edible...  This is a very affordable dinner for the old town area.   I saw what looked to be several \"regulars\" hanging at the bar.  Karsen's will also deliver to several local bars that don't serve food! (J Chew, Rusty Spur, Patties...) Also note that this place is TINY.  http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_035ff3"}
{"text":"Karsens is the perfect neighborhood place.  The veggie sandwich, veggie plater, veggie quesadilla, and grilled cheese (w/ tomato and green chili) are all really good and the fries are always hot and crispy.  Make sure ot introduce yourself to TR - he knows everyone in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Scott is a fantastic greeter and server!  We had the Mac and Cheese Stix, Jalapeño Club and Karsen's Kuhns sandwiches...  excellent flavors!!  This grill/bar place is small but a comfortable hangout"}
{"text":"My favorite little hideaway. Totally a locals bar, but don't let that fool you. The food is absolutely amazing. I've eaten here a few times and it has never been a disappointment. I've introduced a few people to this place and they have become regulars as well. Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Stopped by after a Giants Spring training game and had the Southwest Cardiac Burger. Perfectly cooked goodness. we came back on day 2 and had the Club. Highly recommend, can't wait to come back next season"}
{"text":"Had the beef nachos, the cardiac arrest burger, as well as the green chili Mac and cheese. All were beyond delicious highly recommend and will be back again."}
{"text":"I was surprised by how small this place is but it was totally worth it. We had the fried pickles, and shared the Club with a Bloody Mary and a Cola. Awesome food, great drinks, football and friendly staff. Doesn't get better then that. Oh wait good price too ;o) we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall bar in Old Town!!! This place has been around for a long time and am glad to see this place doing so well. It's small but has a big attitude... There drinks are what you would expect at any bar but there food really stands out.  Start with the Chicken Nachos and Deep Fried Mac n Cheese. Really good and different. Finish up with Chicago Dog and masked your way to the local gym to burn off 10,000 calories."}
{"text":"Wandered in here quite by chance on a Friday night. We had been at Rusty Spur most of the evening. Got out to wandering around and found ourselves here, after initially passing it once, we returned.   Such a small down to earth, charming spot with a few tables and about 8 stools at the bar. It had a crowd of mostly regulars, but being that is was such a small place it wasn't crowded while we were there. They had a small flat screen in the corner playing the Suns game and several people popped in to pick up phone orders and take food to-go.  Seeing that we decided to supplement our liquid dinner with a shared chicken strip plate. Over all it was good, the chicken tenders and the fries were cooked to order and they served with our choice of both BBQ sauce and ranch. Hit the spot.   Service was prompt and very friendly (sorry but I can't recall the man's name who was tending bar...my attention was elsewhere). But I would be sure to go back when he was working."}
{"text":"Loved this place! its small, but the staff treats you so nice and very friendly atmosphere. Food was delicious! they make everything in house and you can tell. Had the burger and it lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"A literal \"hole in the wall\" Karsen's packs a punch bigger than its size. On a quick tour stop in Scottsdale, using Yelp as a guide, my wife and I stumbled into Karsen's .  Per many recommendations we tried the green Mary Lou and it stood up to its reviews. Tender beef served on a flour tortilla flatbread style. Delicious blend of spices added just the right amount of heat. Also had the pork tacos, served as nice chunks of pork rather than carnitas style.  A little kick of spice brought home the southwestern flair.  Side salad was standard but veggies were fresh. Heidi at the bar was sweet an attentive ... Add draft beer and this is a 5 star joint!"}
{"text":"Hands down best place to go before a Giants game. Have a few cocktails before you go to a game and you won't regret it, it's definitely a local spot with tons of personality.  The owner is almost always here and he is a total kick in the pants, the staff are also awesome - friendly, lighthearted and extremely funny. The locals who often frequent Karsen's are also always VERY friendly and always willing to swap sports stories of baseball seasons past.   It is a smaller location and can get pretty crowded before/after games so come a little early and get the best seats in the house. They have a full-bar here and the drinks are seriously dirt cheap (under $4 each), they're also made strong and come served with a smile. The food is also good, we usually stick to whatever the chef special is or get a burger - which are HUGE and great for sharing.  I'm not sure it gets any better than Karsen's - Amazing staff, cheap drinks and great bar food."}
{"text":"This was our first visit, 2 local couples and 5 out-of-towners. We met for lunch on Saturday at 11:30. My first impression was that the place is smaller than I expected. I'll speak to my wife's and my lunch. She said her burger and fries were very good. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was also very good. I ordered the sweet potato fries, which are difficult to make crispy. I've had crispy, so it can be done. These fries were probably the droopiest sweet potato fries I've had. Next time I'll get the regular fries. Our wait-person was very attentive, but not overbearing. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is great and the staff is amazing! There is always a fun atmosphere when I go in for brunch or a drink at night!"}
{"text":"Service was spot on , Pickles chose salt and pepper wings and a southwest cardiac burger that were amazing as well as there French dip was the best I've had in a long time , when I come back to Scottsdale I will be back here too"}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!  We just walked to this place and waitress was very rude to us. My husband went to get the menus and when she saw us her only words were \"you guys couldn't wait for me to serve you and clean the table??\" We didn't stay we were definitely felt not welcome."}
{"text":"In town for Memorial Day weekend with local friends and I am so happy we stopped in! The bar tender Rocky hooked it up with the sweet potato fries and tomato bisque!!! Let me tell to definitely order BOTH!!! Best tomato bisque I have EVER had! Just the smell of the sweet potato fries made me satisfied  I will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"The chipotle chicken sandwich was very tasty, w onion rings & cheddar. A cozy friendly atmosphere where the bartenders introduce themselves and call you by name."}
{"text":"We went to another place 1st for lunch but service was horrible and slow so we bee bopped around the corner and came in here. We tried the fried pickles for and appetizer. Thinly sliced and lightly breaded with a little heat. So good! I had the santa fe salad. It had fresh roasted corn, beans, tomatoes, avocados, chicken and candied jalapenos and served with an avocado ranch type dressing. So good! On fridays, they have fish in many ways. Sandwich, tacos or fish n chips. My friend git the fish sandwich with chipotle coleslaw and a choice of side. Choices are fries, salad, sweet potato fries or a shot of Jager! Yes! So awesome. The owner came out of the kitchen and said hi to us, thanked us for coming in and was chatting up the regulars. Server/bartender was so fast and friendly....we just loved it."}
{"text":"If you're in Old Town Scottsdale and need a place to drink, rest, and eat... Karsen's Grill is the place to go.    Friendliest place ever and seems like they have a lot of regulars who comes. :)  Of course it's a grill so the food is important too and their burritto was excellent.  Very well made and the burrito holds until the last bite."}
{"text":"We spent new years day in Old-town Scottsdale and then spent another good 20 minutes looking up yelp restaurants and walking to different parts of old-town to find they were closed on New Years day.  We passed this restaurant and it smelled really good, but I'm ashamed to admit we bypassed it because it didn't look as cutesy as the other restaurants we were looking at.  Plus it wasn't on the first page of yelp ;).  Finally after striking out for the 3rd time, I stopped and yelped the restaurant name and it came up with great reviews.  I was not disappointed at all.  I got their chipotle burger special while my family respectively ordered their cuban sandwich, french dip and another burger plate.  The food was great and the service was phenomenal!  Our drinks never made it past the halfway mark and he made sure we had everything we wanted right away.  Next time I'll be trying that cuban sandwich, I snuck a bite off my mom's and it was very tasty and I loved the (french?) bread.  My new years resolution is to try a restaurant without the compulsive need to yelp it and to trust my nose over the exterior of a place."}
