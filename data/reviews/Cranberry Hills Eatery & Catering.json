{"text":"I ordered Greek salad with Gyro.. Not only it took forever to get my salad , but the Gyro meet wasn't a gyro.. It looked like a hamburger meat.. Not touching this.. They're getting 2 stars only for customer service."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast from here for the first time and was very good , everything was fresh and delivered on time. I love that they deliver , and reasonable prices
I would definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"A very good place to have lunch with a friend or some co-workers. Our office eats here often, and let me tell you how commendable it is to be able to get orders right when you have 9 or more people ordering at a time! 

They have a fairly good selection, and they're flexible with alterations to your order. The daily soups and specials are also always changing, and are great for adding variety.

I've met the owner several times, and he's a very nice and friendly guy. You can tell when someone is being nice just because you're a customer, and when they're just a good person who happens to run a restaurant, and he's definitely the latter!"}
{"text":"Ordered online and it took an hour and a half to get delivered to me. My soup is lukewarm and my dinner roll is cold....mind you, I literally work across the street. I called about this at the 45 minute mark because my online clock said they would be another hour, but the lady on the phone told me it would only be 15 mins. Fast forward 50 minutes later they FINALLY arrive. 2 stars because the food is decent. Delivery service is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and delicious food! I work in the same building and I all I can say is everyone is the office goes VERY often! Food quality is so good, they're sandwiches are gigantic and delicious! This morning I grabbed up a beagle and its soo good :p !"}
{"text":"I love this place, I eat here very often, they know me by name and also know my order as soon as they see me ( I order the same thing always).
The food is great at a good price. I have spend the same amount of money at subway but the quality is not as good as this place! 
I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"BEST CLUB SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD! I ordered the Sandwich for delivery, the order came on time at a good price. will be ordering again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after seeing the other decent Yelp reviews and wanting to try a new place for lunch. Service was very friendly, but giving one star due to the big disappointment in the food and outdoor patio area. The full size salad there was $6 and definitely not something that would fill you up for lunch. It also was full of sad, almost white iceberg lettuce, with a scant few other veggies. No place to sit outside due to broken umbrellas, un-bussed tables and bird \"stuff\" on one of the tables. The inside seemed okay other than that it was too cold, and the news that was on the TV with one horrific story after the other -- not something you want on over lunch. Had to go to another place afterwards since I was still hungry. Won't be coming back here unfortunately. :("}
{"text":"Nice menu. Nice clean ambiance. The food is just okay. My recent experience was the chicken enchilada lunch special which was served tepid. It should be hot. The chicken was canned and it reminded me of tuna. The whole thing didn't sit well with me. I'll go back in a pinch, but I'm not gonna race back."}
{"text":"Hidden in an office building with barely any nearby parking, this eatery is easy to miss. Their 3003 N Central Ave. # 118 Phoenix address can be very misleading. There isn't any signage or entrance on N. Central Ave.  Instead, it's all on the side street, Catalina Dr.

Cranberry Hills offers breakfast and lunch for dine-in, to-go pickup or delivery and catering. For breakfast, they offer a selection of omelets, egg sandwiches, baked goods and fruit. Their lunch menu consists of standard items such as cold sandwiches, salads, pasta, pizza, soups and bakery items. 

Everything on the menu is extremely reasonably priced. You can walk out the door with a huuuuge salad for less than $7. They also offer their salads in half sizes as well. The food is all around average. The ingredients could be a little fresher at times, and I'm not too keen on the amount of iceberg lettuce that gets thrown into their salads. However they don't skimp on the toppings. Those extras get piled on top. This place is also CROWDED at lunch time. Everyone in that office park seems to eat there daily, and the parking is awful.

My favorite on the menu is #48 - the Orchard salad with a standard bed of greens, chicken strips, oranges, apples, jicama, dried cranberries and walnuts, served with country French dressing (that I usually switch out for their Roasted Red Pepper Fat Free dressing, just so save those extra calories). 

I've also used this place for catering before and for the price it's very economical and fast. They will drop off your order and set up a really awesome and professional salad bar complete with all the fixings - salad mix, nuts, cheeses, an assortment of dressings, turkey, ham, chicken, fruit, tortilla strips, etc. I've also used Cranberry Hills Catering for those last moment \"oh no I forgot to order lunch and the meeting is in 4 hours from now\" situations. They've saved the day for me countless times!

I wouldn't go out of my way to get their food for just an individual order. I mainly recommend this place for catering in addition to those last minute office lunch emergencies. They are fast and convenient if you work in the Mid-town Phoenix area.

Since they don't have it on here, this is a link to their Web site http://bit.ly/cLvlvG"}
{"text":"I love this place. I work nearby and have eaten here many times over the past 10 years. The food is always fresh and the staff and owners are friendly and know many of their customers by name."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews that weren't very good, realized that most of them are really old reviews and this place is definitely worth a look!

A few folks ordered breakfast from here this morning and I missed out on the order since I don't arrive to the office until later.  The smell of all the delicious food made me curious.  I asked around and everyone RAVED about how wonderful the breakfast was and so reasonably priced.  I had to try for myself.

Got another gal in the office to order as well and too bad breakfast was done being served for the day by that time.  So we ordered lunch instead.  I got the half sandwich and soup.  Vermont chicken and side of chili.  Let me just say that the chili is TO DIE FOR!  I ate it first and then dove into the sandwich.  Sandwich was AMAZING as well!  The only thing I would have done differently is order a different type of bread.  I got the 12 grain and it was a little messy trying to eat since the bread squished down on top.  I'd either ask them to toast the bread or get it on a roll instead.  Either way, the chicken salad is HEAVENLY!  She got the clam chowder in a bread bowl and said it was very very good also.  

We WILL be back and I'm going to suggest this place to cater our next meeting to our admin folks.  It was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this location twice since I was attending a training course nearby.  The first time, it wasn't bad.  It was a little pricey, but the meals were prepared correctly.  The second time, however, was a totally different story.  I placed an order for a Water Chestnut Tuna sandwich and received a Veggie sandwich.  I called to have them fix it and redeliver and spoke to Monica.  Monica reviewed my order for a Water Chestnut Tuna sandwich and said it would be delivered.  The second sandwich was another Veggie.  I called again and spoke to Monica again.  This time she snapped at me and told me that I ordered a Veggie sandwich.  I asked how they could even be confused since they sound nothing alike?  After telling me that I couldn't talk to her that way, I had her get the manager on the phone.  I explained the situation to him (Peter) and he said he'd send out another sandwich and apologized for the poor service and incorrect orders.  Guess who delivered it?  Monica!  Apparently she volunteered to drop it off to me.  After handing me the sandwich and telling me to check it, she storms off and says \"Next time, you aren't to talk to me like that\".  No problem, I'll just speak to your manager.  The receptionist heard the entire thing and was on the phone to her manager again.  The manager (this time Jerry) said she bagged my order and Monica volunteered to drive it over herself.  We informed Jerry that it wasn't bagged and Monica just handed us the sandwich.  I threw it away.  There is no way I'm eating a sandwich that came from someone with an attitude like that.  Personally, there are a ton of other restaurants that deliver in Central Phoenix.  I recommend choosing another one besides Cranberry Hills."}
{"text":"Cranberry Hills is nice because they deliver. However, the food isn't very good, the service is super slow if you decide to eat there, and the employees are rude."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. I work across the street and eat here every day for lunch. Their veggie sandwich, bagels and greek salad are all delicious. 

The owners are there every day, which says a lot to me. Plus, they're super friendly."}
{"text":"Well I have update yet but did I tell you how goid the frizen yogurt is, there are new fkavors daily!"}
{"text":"Had soup and chicken salad sandwich which were both very good.  Staff are very friendly and helpful.  Gets very busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"Not only is this the best freshest food for lunch, but the staff is amazing! They know my name when I call or stop in and they ALWAYS have a smile to greet me with. I adore the \"family\" feel and talk about amazing food! If it's not on the menu I can ask and have it most often made for me to my liking. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My company uses Cranberry Hills regularly to cater for meetings, and they are always extremely accomodating! Yesterday I had a meeting that added a few people at the last moment (an hour before the meeting started)- so I was able to call in an get more added to our order quickly- and then we had a change after our meeting started so I emailed them with the change and they responded immediately. Very helpful!"}
{"text":"Cranberry Hills is a great spot to grab breakfast or lunch or order takeout via phone from a nearby business.  I believe they cater to office workers in the area who often order for meetings or groups to be delivered. 

All of their food is extremely fresh, as they prepare it anew each day.  Their Indian Salad is their best salad offering IMHO.  Be sure to ask for grilled chicken strips on your Indian Salad, otherwise I think it comes with some steamed or boiled chicken.  Also, be sure to ask for extra lime-cilantro dressing (which they make from scratch daily) which is superb!

Their Vermont Chicken sandwich is to die for!  It comes with several options of sides (as do all their sandwiches).

If you work anywhere along Central Avenue from downtown to uptown, or anywhere between 7th Avenue and 7th Street and McDowell and Camelback, call Cranberry Hills for delivery for lunch at least twice a week!  They deliver further than that for a five dollar fee. The reason their prices are so reasonable is that in order to keep their regular office workers happy and ordering several times a week, it must be cost-effective.  But their low prices don't cut into their profits because they have so many customers.

They are near the corner of Central and Catalina.  You can pull in easiest heading west on Catalina (from 3rd Street).  The parking lot is small, but you'll be outta there in no time, and you will want to come back, especially if you ordered the Indian Salad and/or Vermont Chicken sandwich.  I have done the legwork and scouted all the salad spots in the general area over a ten year period.  Cranberry Hills has the best, freshest salads!

Cranberry Hills - will you marry me!?"}
{"text":"The grllled cheese is never grilled to crispy.  It's two pieces of mushy bread with the false hope of it being crispy by the faint grill marks and semi- melted cheese in between.  The fries are usually lukewarm."}
{"text":"I ordered using Eat24. Food took over an hour. I asked for a call OR text when the food was delivered in the notes section of my order. I received neither. My order was also incorrect as I asked not to have ice in my drink. The owner/manager suggested I call instead of using Eat24. No, I should not have to call when you have online platforms your business is on. Worst service ever."}
{"text":"Good place to eat for lunch if you aren't really sure where to go or order from. You'll know your food won't be bad and it may not be spectacular either but you'll get what you expect. I just really love the steak fries. I got the Tuna Melt on my most recent order earlier today. It was pretty good. I'm sure I'll order from this place yet again."}
{"text":"Got a burger delivered from these guys and the delivery time was the fastest I have experienced since using Grub Hub. I was really happy to see that this place gave a shit about their customers, they didn't have the side I wanted so they actually called me and asked me if I would prefer a different side instead of just throwing something else in there without consulting me like so many other restaurants involved with Grub Hub have done to me in the past. Even if I had ordered something I didn't like I would try this place again because they actually care about you. On to what I got; The BBQ bacon burger was pretty good, the sauce seemed quite generic but I can live with that. The patty was cooked exactly how I ordered it, the lettuce and tomatoes were crunchy and tasted fresh. The bun was pretty squished and slightly burnt but I will chalk the morphed bun up to the nature of it being delivered. The fruit salad also surprised me, the fruit was all quite fresh and not like some mushy gross fruit salad cups you would get elsewhere. After reading the reviews for this place I can see that it has been in business for a long time and has served many satisfied customers after eating here you will understand why that is."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Having just moved into a new building for work, this hidden gem was an amazing find.  They serve Breakfast and Lunch, and everything thus far has been fabulous.  I have a pet peeve when it comes to the bacon I get for breakfast and these guys cook it fresh!  Their soups, salads, sandwiches and pasta are all fresh.  They use fresh baked bread, with fresh ingredients.  Even if you don't work in the building, if you're nearby - stop in.  It'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place about 4 yrs ago. The food is always fresh and top quality.  It is always delivered fast and efficient.  my order is prepared exactly how I request it.  I have ordered the salads, chicken sandwich,  breakfast items and lunch specials, all which I highly recommend to everyone. The prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly. I would give six stars,  but Yelp only gives five as the highest.  :) I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"Cranberry hills has consistently good food, and a great variety of lunch options. My office area and I visit at least once a week! Great soup, salads, french fries, and desserts. They also deliver, which is nice when we have deadlines"}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday morning for a fruit cup. The cashier was SLOW, not friendly and not helpful. Oh did I say slow?  He seemingly was lacking in wanting a customer.  I was on my way to the light rail and he was taking his time (he is at work I guess) and seemingly was hesitant and wanted to say something to me when I asked if I could get the other cup--- it had more grapes.  NOT IMPRESSED!  His customer service was AWFUL!  It is such a cute eatery...I will NOT go back if I can help it. This should have been a quick and simple transaction."}
{"text":"Considering it's not much more than a lunch room for the surrounding offices, it's really not bad. Most of the sandwiches I've had there have been ok experiences. The service is quick.  

I've noticed that they sometimes will spoil an otherwise really good dining experience by doing something like leaving pits in certain olives that appeared to be without pits. Or some of the cole slaw will be wilted. Or the shell in the clam chowder mentioned earlier. I don't consider these events fatal flaws, but y'know . . . come on. . . . a little more effort.

I don't like how the line is laid-out. The path from ordering and paying to picking up your food and drink is convoluted and annoying. They could improve their flow and ergonomics and make take away some of the anxiety I feel before going there--and thus I might go there more frequently."}
{"text":"Delicious, consistent and affordable.  Plus the owners are Italian so you know its going to be good.  I eat here about once a week."}
{"text":"So I made my Fav stop Friday, December 15th morning just after 7 am and I was greeted by the most rudest young woman at the register , who frankly did not know what she was doing and she was just full of attitude . She had a Orange logo Cranberry Hills shirt on , Latina and again just rude to me. She had to keep calling over another worker for help. She got me so upset I told her \" I need a moment \" and I slowly walked away from her , what bothered me was I could hear both these young women talking about me behind my back. I got finally got so upset by their lack of professionalism , I walked out without putting in my order and walked across the street to City Bistro. Owners Pete and Geri , I will not be back for a while. I love you guys but I did not appreciate that behavior ."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the last couple months since it is close to where i work. I have ordered a sourdough BLT probably 4 times and the always end up giving me white. I kept going back mostly because they had pretty good fries. The last time i went i double checked my receipt since they always get the bread wrong. I noticed it said white so i mentioned it to one of the woman making the food, she seemed to not understand but the owner (the man who took my order) asked me and i told him i wanted sourdough not white and he told the lady and she seemed to understand however when i got my order it was still white bread. Not the biggest deal but still enough to prevent me from going back. Plus the fries were cold."}
{"text":"This is definitely on my top list of places for breakfast.  So worth the walk from the office and the staff, especially the two owners are absolutely awesome.  Always enjoy coming over here and suggest it to anyone I can.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Cranberries for 14.5 years and well EVERYONE there knows my name! Peter, Geri, Josephine and Stuart have an amazing staff and the food is so delicious!! I pretty much get the same thing for breakfast every time I visit them and their lunch specials (and menu) are just as delicious as the breakfast menu! I have NEVER ever had a bad meal and everyone I've taken to Cranberries with me keeps going back. 

I like going to a place where the owners get to know you and they do exactly that! They appreciate their customers and I appreciate them!"}
{"text":"I have been using Cranberry HIlls to cater meetings for 3-4 years.  I have never eaten in the restaurant.  In general, I try and support local businesses, although it's often easier (and even cheaper) to just order catering from Corner Bakery or something.  I have never had particularly good service from Cranberry Hills and often have a rather unpleasant time placing the orders, but the food has always been pretty good.  Well, today, they forgot to deliver my order for a meeting, and when I was put on the phone with Jeri to resolve she was actually kind of rude saying \"what order?.\"  I was appreciative that they scrambled to get the order together and deliver one hour after the scheduled time...but you can imagine, I was very frustrated and asked to have a discount on the bill, so when she called back, she said she would waive the delivery fee ($5) and required 15% gratuity.  The gratuity goes to the delivery driver and the kitchen staff... not the catering management that made the error in scheduling my order.  I didn't want them to get penalized for the management's mistake, but Geri assured me the staff would be taken care of and was defensive that she had to stop taking new orders to help get my order out.  When the order finally came and I received the bill, the gratuity was still included... but they waived the $5 delivery fee.  Gee thanks.  This was the last of my frustrating interactions with Cranberry Hills for catering - I will stick with more reliable companies in the future."}
