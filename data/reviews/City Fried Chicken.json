{"text":"Chicken burger is good, has an interesting BBQ and chipotle sauce condiment, and fries are seasoned well but could use more salt, but you can add your own.   This location is superior to the York Mills one and chicken even when not fresh is worth it.  Might be a dollar more than Popeyes but I feel Popeyes has gone downhill."}
{"text":"I was craving some chicken and was recommended  to this place by a friend and man was it great. We got a grilled chicken and fried chicken sandwich (cut each in half so we could try both). Both chicken sandwiches were awesome but my personal favourite was the fried one. I liked how the chicken was not over breaded like some places and I could actually taste it.   Everything was well put together and I had no complaints about the service , I plan to go back again to try the philly cheese steak which looked yummy as well."}
{"text":"Their poutine is the greatest poutine I've had in Toronto! They are always nice when I come to visit!"}
{"text":"Brined eh? It was evident from the moistness of this chicken. The owner is also a very friendly guy who hooked us up with french fries. They didn't have white meat at the time. That didn't bother me since I like dark meat too. The French fries were decent as well. I spotted a nearby location on Victoria Park, just north of Ellesmere I believe."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is amazing. The steak fries is no joke the best thing I ever had in my life. Don't look like it but once you have a bite the flavors just explode in your mouth. Just absolutely amazing. The Philly is one other best in GTA and I have tried around. Customer Service is outstanding."}
{"text":"Chicken is extra crispy. Proprietor is friendly, and the restaurant is clean. I recommend the steak and fries!"}
{"text":"Very fast service. The food here is filled with flavour!   The steak on fries had to have been my favourite loaded fries ever. I highly recommend them but must warn you that you'll be craving them all the time! The philly cheese steak was pretty normal, nothing to be wow'd over, could have used a little more sauce   Overall I'd definitely go back!"}
