{"text":"The food has always been amazing. Kitchen staff is great. The kitchen staff actually does some of the delivery.   I had used this place a bit and my interest has waned due to courtesy of staff taking the orders. I previously read some of the negative reviews and felt very confused. I had always been happy with the quality and wasn't put off by interactions. Through time, the individuals taking the orders over the phone and at the site have helped me understand the collective feel of this place. Not sure if they are trying to lose money on purpose or what. If so, they are headed in the right direction."}
{"text":"Food purchased on the adult menu was fantastic.  Antipasta salad, philly cheesesteak, and calzone.  Kids food was of average taste and not necessarily set up to cater to kids.    Server was competent, getting the orders right and came by frequently to refill drinks.   Restaurant was clean and modern with a comfortable feel.   There have been a few businesses come and go in this location, but hopefully this will be a good fit and will pull through.  Location will make it difficult; tucked back behind an old and tired shopping center with minimal traffic.    Can't wait to go back and try other delicious looking items on the food menu!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Service was kinda crappy, the server just seemed a bit distracted and and not very experienced, I could get past that though and go back for food. They didn't seem to have all their tvs running which caused some tension on the patio when most everyone wanted to watch the fight and a couple ladies got cranky because they wanted to watch basketball, so they put it on basketball. Otherwise, food was spot on and quite delicious."}
{"text":"Save yourself the time and just go down to Barrows Pizza. It's just a mile or so up the road."}
{"text":"So, haven't been here in a few month's. I've always been happy with this place. Except for the bathrooms. They never had soap and paper to dry your hands in the men's restroom. Now! The customer service is as all ways exceptional and now the bathrooms are straight! You all need to visit!"}
{"text":"My family and I have an amazing time each visit the food is great and reasonably priced the drinks are great never watered down the resturaunt is clean and the owner is on site and makes a point to speak to all the customers and to ensure they are enjoying their visit we are also there for the events they hold for local Arizona music artists to preform on Saturday evenings"}
{"text":"The beer was cold. The food was pretty good. The staff couldn't be better over all a great experience."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. Service was good, but as the place was empty, it should have been. We had a $20 Groupon but they only took $18.51 off the bill. Beer was cold was the only positive. Not a place I would go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good but this time around it wasn't, had a pizza and wings delivered, food was decent but the delivery was really poor, to start the driver calls me soon as he gets to my complex and says he can't find my place, this is the second time this particular guy didn't even try to look for my apartment. So I went out and met him on the street, he proceeds to tell me how dark my complex is and he couldn't see the apartment wings, my complex is very well lit mind you, so I go to pay the guy and wasn't going to tip him my total was about 29.00 I gave him 40 and he tells me he doesn't have change other then maybe about 5 dollars he has in his own wallet. At this point I just said screw it and to keep the 5. Need less to say I won't be ordering from here anytime soon. Decent food bad service"}
{"text":"They may be better dine in. My meal was delivered cold and the order was not correct. Kofta looked and tasted like preprocessed greasy breakfast sausages. Gyro was bland. Pizza might have been good if it was delivered hot. Dogs enjoyed the Kofta."}
{"text":"Ordered the gold hot wings had them  sit in the fryer little bit longer the owner guaranteed me if they weren't the best wings I ever had that they were free.... He was very adamant about he would guarantee me the winds were free if I didn't like them. So I ordered the wings and the flavor for the golden hot was actually surprisingly pretty tasty. I shook the owner's hand when he said he guaranteed me that the wings would be the best I ever had and I was going to hold him to it. And when the wings came to the table they were actually very enjoyable. It only took about I'm minute and a half for somebody to be coming to take my order. I was overall pleased with the restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I love both going to and ordering delivery from Maya!  Great for both date nights and family nights.  The owner and the staff are fabulous, always friendly and accommodating as well as social.  Highly recommend taking the time to try Maya for it to become one of your favorite places too!!!"}
{"text":"We went there last night and my hubby and I split a Stromboli.  It was cooked to perfection, service was great.  We met the owners and they mentioned that they were bombarded when they first opened.  They have been working on service and staffing issues.  Our service and food were great.  I would  encourage those who weren't happy to give them another try.  We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I give this review two stars because our food arrived on time and its exactly what we ordered. My boyfriend and I called for a delivery. Whoever was behind the phone taking our order down had a mean tone and was inpatient with us. We felt rush and not respected like a customer. Customer service is very important, to bring more people, not to chase them away.. Anyways, our food came and I've never seen this before but they had our take outs in a small black trash bag. Are you serious? C'mon giving food out with a freakin trash bag!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the bs reviews.... We ordered last night. $60+ for a 2 pizzas and 2. Salads + cheese bread. No flavor at all. How do you make a margarita pizza without any flavor!!!!! Don't waist you money."}
{"text":"Could have been an off day for the waitress, but she was just \"spacey\".  The place was not busy, but we waited...and waited and waited.  Ans this was just for the drinks!(which she managed to get wrong).  Now, the food.  Because of the long delay on drinks(two tap beers, by the way, served in smudged glasses)we ordered a couple of sandwiches(my wife had the gyro, I had the Italian beef)thinking it would be fairly quick----wrong.  They must have sensed that we were ready to walk, when these very un-special items were delivered to our booth.  At least the fries were hot---sandwiches, eh, so-so.  The owner finally came over to give us the bill.  We won't give it a second chance.  Too many good restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Can I leave a 0 .. is that an option? These people are seriously the dumbest bunch of \"human beings\" that they could find to work food service. First of all, we have ordered from there 4 or 5 other times and the reason we go back is because the food is good, compared to what is nearby. Tonight the food was horrible .. way too much cheese on the pizza, French fries were definitely reheated- whether microwaved or not and the Philly cheese steak was overcooked and just gross tbh. So we called the location and asked to speak to a manager just to let him/her know that the food was not their norm and the cooks have either changed or just don't give a crap at this hour. We don't ever ask for freebies nor would we accept one so that was not the reason for our call, it was simple friendly feedback. The manager was \"not on site\" and \"could not be found\" and the young kid started getting loud and outright unprofessional. I am extremely disappointed in their customer service and their food.  It's amazing how one can crumble so quickly and lose all of the business that we have generated for you through ourselves and 15+ friends/family....    Moral of the story- they are: Rude Unprofessional Cholesterol clogging amount of cheese on pizza Overcooked Philly cheese steak  Microwaved French fries  Lack of management  Lack of customer service    ....to the manager on duty tonight 11pm July 9th, all you had to do was take the call and receive our feedback since we generally are very happy with your service/food. Instead you were a pansy or just not working when you were getting paid to and now there is this glorious review on yelp. Your boss must be so proud of you...."}
{"text":"I love the food, great flavors, Delivery is always hot, but not consistent in serving size. One time I ordered two salads and they were so huge that the next time I only ordered one and it was half the size as normal. This time I ordered one and it was huge. Same thing with the cheesecake they charged four dollars for a 1 inch cheesecake. Last time it was like 3 inches wide. Chicken wings are great, good size, good flavor, pizzas classic good sauce, salads are good, had most of them. Not a fan of the house dressing too chunky for me. Also order a 2 liter of getting a soda for $3.00. The Fountain soda which is $2.25 is maybe 16 ounces and mostly ice. I've never eaten in the restaurant"}
{"text":"Not much to review. Hours on Yelp reflect that Maya opens at 10:30AM. We arrived at 10:45AM. The OPEN sign was illuminated and there were 5 cars in the parking lot. We walked up and the doors were locked?? I felt like I was in a freakin Mervyn's commercial...open. open. open. They never did open the doors.."}
{"text":"Worse delivery ever. Waited an hour only to call and be told it's not on its way yet. I'm not a pizza chef but I'm pretty sure you wouldn't need as much time to make each ingredient from scratch. I've never been so disgusted with service, but maya has done it. I have filled out my 1st online rating. I'm not sure I even want to taste the quality of the pizza if they can't even handle a delivery literally .5 mi. Down the road. Fuck this place straight up...I could have made and ate a full course meal in this time frame. Idiots"}
{"text":"Me and my friends came in for the raiders game tonight and I have some mixed feelings about the place. First I'll start with the good,  our server, kc, was one of the best servers we ever had. Even though she had allot of tables she still managed to make sure our glasses were never empty and that we had what we needed quickly. She had a great personality and was funny too. I only wish we were able to top her more. Now for the not so great news, in the middle of our meal one of the other servers I'm not sure of her name but I think it started with L just started yelling at our server over something trivial very loudly in front of everyone in the restaurant... she was very unprofessional. But kc even handle that situation with class and took her customers mind off that bad juju with an amusing joke. All in all the service was great one waitress was not. I would totally eat there again as long as I got kc as our waitress."}
{"text":"After looking at the reviews I was thinking maybe maybe not. I chose to go and, this will be a partial review.   Looks 7.1 Bar decent stock, but above all clean. I ordered a draft beer for happy hour special. San tan devils ale.  Rating on that, mug was clean, frosted and chilled. Perfection.  Food came reasonably hot and fresh. Although I was not very pleased with the sample platter of chx, tenders, cheese sticks, onion rings and fried zucchini. It was a bit warm and over fried, dark on color instead of golden brown. Maybe a case of old grease. I will try again another night.  I also took a small order of wings to compare them to native New Yorker across the street. I only ordered one flavor, golden. And I must say as a wing fanatic they are well above average, and a heck of a lot better than native New Yorkers.   I also ordered the chicken kabob which did not come on a stick, but none the less was beyond excellent.   Seasoned very well and not over powering, but most of all moist and tender. Which is so rare to find these days, my compliments to the chef on those, yummy, only complaint not enough chicken but we all know the good stuff cost for more.  Bill was average for two around Mesa, service was a little green. But as I waited I also noticed the servers huddled around the register. Learning , so I think in a few months the kinks will be worked out here. Just bare with the owner, and give a little time , this might become a local spot if given a chance.  I will come back At least three more times to update and give the thumbs up or down, till then I say give them a try and be a lil understanding"}
{"text":"Have had dinner here a few times and must say the food is great. Freshly made and owner is there nightly. Had bake  lasagna tonight with shrimp on top. Excellent and very large portion. Homemade Vegetable soup was really good.  If they had a down side I would say the service could be better. Servers should be more professional and better dressed."}
{"text":"Pizza is definitely good - about as good a NY style pizza as one can get in Mesa.  For this reason, I can't go below 4 stars.  The chicken wings were decent.  Downsides - the service is OK, but not great.  Its a notch pricey for the area its in.  I went with my wife, no kids - if I went back, I'd keep it that way.  Its not totally unfriendly towards 'family', but probably not the best either.  Can't knock it on these grounds - it is called \"Bar & Grill\"....."}
{"text":"Ordered catering food for a business luncheon from this restaurant. Moose, the owner called me back to confirm the order, a couple days prior. I ordered a tray of Greek salad, a tray of lasagna, a tray of fettuccine alfredo, garlic knots, and a tray of brownies. I was feeding 33 people and had a lot left over. My plane ended up being delayed, so I was late getting into Phx. I called and Jessica said someone would deliver it. The cook delivered the food and it was DELICIOUS! Great service, great food at an affordable price $8.00/pp. Really positive experience. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza terrible customer service, i just moved to the neighborhood Jul 27th and while moving my stuff one night got hungry and ordered from them. When the food finally got to me as i open the box to see that my pepperoni pizza is a pineapple and my 2-liter of coke that was bagged was a sprite. I called immediately back and was promised a free pizza by a man who said he spoke to a manager. Today i tried to call in receive said free pizza apparently nobody has heard of the situation i spoke to one manager who then called another manager and they wouldnt do anything in return."}
{"text":"We went twice. The first time we left after ten minutes of being ignored. The second time we were ignored for seven minutes. Server didn't write down order and had to come back a second time to double check it's accuracy. Hubby ordered a salad and had to ask for it when the food was delivered. We ordered lasagna, noodles with marinara, and a calzone. Everything tasted good; however, my calzone was overly cheesy making it soggy and greasy. Couldn't finish it. Environment was nice, but found it odd that a place that just opened had lights that weren't working. Temp was hot.  Never saw a manager."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a flat bread pizza and a beer, instead opted for wings and breaded zucchini. They were both great!  Outstanding service. This place is only a few months old, but with great food and a nice ambiance, it's well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've never written a review on Yelp before, but being an Italian-American, I had to comment on how horrible this was. We are starved, and couldn't even eat it. It's all been thrown in the trash. I ordered the chicken meal, which is fried, although I don't remember it as being listed as fried in the description. Not a big deal, except there's no special seasoning or flavor. It's just really deep fried chicken. Then I ordered the Italian beef sandwich.  Again, it's just a hunk of beef in a crappy roll with cheese on it. No good flavor, and somehow a horrible after taste. Then, the shocker, was the fetucine alfredo. How do you screw this up? I've never had bad fetucine alfredo before. If you order this, and you're expecting this to taste like fetucine alfredo, you're in for an unfortunate surprise. It's disgusting. We all tried one bite of it, shocked that something as difficult to screw up as fetucine alfredo would be inedible,  but after one bite each, in the garbage it went. I have no idea why some people go into the restaurant business. Obviously some people have other motives besides serving good food."}
{"text":"Actually I would give this place a big fat zero. (Mainly for service) We've ordered from here a few times before, and the food has been okay. The woman taking our order was incredibly rude, and short with us. The delivery driver said she was lost, and supposedly was driving around for \"haaalf an hoourrr \". Paid her in the street. Funny no one else has had that much of an issue with our place. Lazy much.. Well the food is cold/soggy, AND my salad is completely spilled into the plastic bag. Gross. We have called repeatedly to speak with a manager, but keep getting the phone put down on us, and waiting for over \"haalf an hoourr\" each time... Hmm no manager I guess?? Wth    UPDATE actually have called SEVENTEEN TIMES. We were told that it was hard to speak to a manager because there was a DJ there.. If you are going to do delivery, and it's only 9pm and you're open until 2 am GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER OR DONT DO IT. And now they re just not answering. We're pretty relaxed people, haven't been rude once, and we're very understanding of most things. Bad days happen. But don't disrespect a customer like this, it's obvious they aren't even trying.  NOT ONE SINGLE APOLOGY OR EVEN EYE CONTACT. Just excuses, attitude, and then ignored. I AM REPULSED."}
{"text":"I was going to write this review awhile ago, so I apologize for the delay. I came in with friends towards the end of December and I can't remember her name but we had the sweetest nicest waitress! I had a bad cold and just wanted hot water bc I didn't think they had tea, she brought me out my own personal hot water mini kettle, tea, lemons and all the fixings! I definitely wasn't expecting that! She went above and beyond making sure I was happy. I wish I could have remembered her name to give appropriate kudos!   Also, I ordered the calzone and it was sooo amazing! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I came here in October and waited 45 minutes at the bar for a beer and I stated it on Facebook. After some several months someone from the bar reached out and asked for a second chance. I was hesitant but decided to give it another shot. Me and my brother went in and were greeted by the bartender. I asked for a specific waitress that I know and was hoping she might change my outlook on this place. The bartender rolled her eyes and said in a rude manner that she doesn't work there anymore. So we sit and my brother he ordered a coke and me a beer. After a few minutes the coke came out. That's great now I just need my beer. Mind you we are sitting at the high top tables 5 feet from the bar and there are maybe 20 people in the whole place. I waited for 30 minutes as I waited for the rude bartender to finish her conversation with the regulars to get me my beer. The waiter finally took our order and the waiting game started all over again. People that were regulars and came in after us were getting drunks and food a hell of a lot faster then us. We ordered 2 burgers that took 45 minutes from ordering to come out. It was a pile or processed greasy cheap crap. It tasted like it had been frozen for 2 years. I wanted to bring it to the manger or owners attention but he was to busy socializing with the bar and ignoring everyone else. All and all if I could give this 0 stars I would. I WILL NOT BEING GOING BACK HERE EVER. And I will tell anyone I know to avoid here. Go to native across the street before here."}
{"text":"We live super close to this place and were excited when it opened.....and so far we've been let down. We've been there twice:  Pros: -Seated quickly both times -Bartender (I think he's the owner too) makes great drinks -Mozzarella sticks were good  Cons: -Waitresses aren't very good or attentive or even friendly or quick -I'm pretty sure I got the wrong flavor of wings and the waitress argued with me. I ate them anyway and didn't want them to make more. -Food is sometimes hit or miss - pizza is okay but not great, wings aren't anything special. -Food wait time is ridiculous. Both times it took a long time to get our food and it didn't come out at the same time, which was weird. (But I think it was because our waitress missed an item and put it in late.)  We'll try it again a couple times, but this might be a place we go for drinks only (not food). Overall, just disappointed."}
{"text":"Nobody around to greet anyone walking in, service/ hostess was scattered and working on too many things to even give us a quick response of just \"no\" because we bought a groupon for four people instead of two. The groupon is why we were trying this place. The manager didn't even think for a second to even give a shit that we may have wanted to eat... fuck that shit, trading the groupon to a different restaurant. There are many."}
{"text":"We asked about the house wine and were told it was good. No such luck. The pizza was good, but the service was lacking."}
{"text":"Ok so let's give them credit new location we need one here wings were amazing!!! Pizza looked awesome owner is there to please dogs allowed on patio way cute VIP room inside!!!! The wait staff was too young and inexperienced the owner should hire more mature and experienced servers!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Maya New York Pizza Bar & Grill this evening, and it was superb in both service and food. Diann was in charge of our table, and after a busy day in the Arizona heat we began with 25-ounce beer mugs, a Peroni and a Four Peaks dark. We got them at happy hour prices.   For an appetizer we got something we had never had before--garlic knots. They were amazing, made largely of pizza crust strips tied in knots and dipped in a superb marinara sauce.   For dinner we shared a large calzone with an added topping of meatballs. Diann said a large one is \"quite large\" and after we got it we were happy we did not choose the extra large one. We also shared a small but generous Maya House salad with crisp greens and all the right toppings, eaten along with the delicious calzone.   As we were leaving we discovered the room with live music on Wednesday nights. Several people were eating in that room, and we plan to go there next.   Maybe our fatigue from the day made this seem so special. Maybe it was Diann's great service with a perpetual smile. Maybe it was the consistently tasty dishes. But most likely, it was all those things combined in a most satisfying casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Always my go to order for a good filling and tasty dinner that is guaranteed to satisfy! They know their food when it comes to pasta, pizza, and their sandwich options!"}
{"text":"We first visited Maya a couple months after they opened. That visit was great. The service was very good, the pizzas were excellent and the spicy gold wings were awesome. Went back a month later. Service was marginal, the food was still above average. 2 months later, the food was good, the service was abysmal. It's unfathomable to me how your server can ignore you when you're sitting at the bar...   I really want Maya to suceed, as the neighborhood needs a restaurant like this as Native Grill across the street has gone down the toilet. Unless ownership pays attention to these reviews and does something about it, i dont see that happening."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst places ive ever ate at!! There was a roach crawling around and a long curly hair in my daughters pizza. On top of all of that the manager had poor customer service skills and didn't give a crap about the hair or the bug he wanted  to make us another pizza to go. Why would we want another hair to eat? Then he wanted to charge us a $20 tip!! My family and I will not be going back here!! The manager even told us we were not welcome back because he got butt hurt over my review! Mind you we spent over $100 that night and he called us liars!"}
{"text":"Found a hair. A HAIR! LONG, STRINGY, AND BLACK in my pizza and the only consolation I received from management was 50% off THE PIZZA. Outrageous. Besides the hair, the pizza wasn't even good. It tasted like cafeteria food. Gross."}
{"text":"Husband and I had high hopes for the place, the first time we ate here the wings were fantastic, staff was great and the owner came over to talk with us. We decided to go there again, and ordered the Hummus, after viewing the picture of the jalapeno and cilantro Hummus with veggies and pita bread, we had high hopes, what was placed in front of us was a bad joke. They placed the plate in front of us and it just had pita bread and these foul tasting black olives out of a can thrown on top of it. When we inquired about the way it was presented in the picture, the waitress just shrugged, and said that was just a picture, they don't serve it that way. She just looked disgusted, when I asked why they would show it that way if it did not include the veggies, her reply was, \"Well I guess I could see what we could do.\" She dropped a plate of poorly cut, carrots and celery down at our table. Then came out Gyro on pita, all I could say was yuck, I expected better, the owner is Turkish.  And than the Mexican music started. I do not think we will be back, it is a shame as it held such promise."}
{"text":"We were sat right away, for a Saturday night that was awesome. Server came quickly got our drink order, we all so ordered sampler platter and so wings. Sampler platter had chicken strips, onion rings, cheese sticks, and zucchini. All fried with great dipping sauces and deep fried yumminess. Wing were very flavorful, not a lot of sauce. We also ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and sausage pizza. Pizza was hot, fresh and great. Service was great until we got our food, she didn't return for a check back or to refill drinks. The only think I would change was the music was so loud. Food was awesome."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals we've had in a very long time. Pasta was ridiculously soggy and had clearly been sitting under the heat lamp for far too long. We took two bites and literally fed it to our dog and I felt a little bad giving it to her, that's how disgusting it was. Garlic toast was burnt and completely inedible. The delivery service was also poor, they showed up stating my card had been declined. I had to awkwardly stand there and call the restaurant (because the first option he offered to me was to write my card information down on a piece of paper which seemed shady). Why would you ask for my number when I placed the order and then not call me when the card declined? The card worked just fine, guy on the phone said he had the expiration incorrect. When I called to let the restaurant know the food was no good to eat, they didn't offer anything; a refund, send the meal again, something and it would have made it a little better and I honestly would not have taken the time to write this. All the woman said was sorry, they've had some problems with the delivery people and that she'd pass it along. I didn't even have a yelp account until this experience, so thanks Maya for being so terrible it made me want to take the time to let everyone else know. I would give you negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"This is the worst establishment in our area. My friend and I are both handicapped so we ordered for delivery. We waited for well over an hour. By then we were starving so paid the man plus a tip. We sat down to watch a movie and eat our pizza. The pizza was ice cold. My friend called Maya's to see what happened and what they could do to correct it after waiting over an hour and getting an ice cold pizza. The girl said sho would ask and please hold. We held for maybe 15 minutes and they hung up on us. Called again, same run around. My handicapped friend just out of surgery grabbed the pizza and rode his scooter nearly 1/2 mile to speak to the manager. The manager was rude and yelling in front of customers he would not give us a new pizza and my friend, by this time furious, Insisted he get his money back which he finally got. But not without a lot of threats from manager and being told to get out of his restaurant and never come back. Like we ever would? He also has a habit of not paying his servers. One a friend of ours who remains too afraid to go back and ask for it. My recomendation is STAY AWAY."}
{"text":"Just another sports bar with poor service, food was ok but the service was just bad. Our server was very unfamiliar with the menu and we noticed others in the bar area with the same complaint. Oh and does the photo of my chicken wings look like the photos that Maya added themselves...no, as I believe they are using stock photos and the food presentation is no where near what they have uploaded."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place. The food honestly isn't terrible. We used to order delivery from them often. The last time we ordered delivery, our order was definitely not the quality we were used to from them and it took WAY longer than expected for it to be delivered. When I called to talk with the manager, Mustafa, he was actually really nice. He apologized, explained they had been extremely busy, and offered us a credit.  Tonight, we were craving salad so we thought we'd give them another try. I called to see if they would honor the credit. The lady I talked to said she would have to call me back to let me know if it was possible. She called back, said she would honor it, and was really nice when she took my order. When out food came, the delivery driver was super nice, too.   When I opened the to go box, it looked great with fesh ingredients and lots of veggies. I was actually really excited about my salad at this point. I poured my dressing on and started to eat. I think I might have gotten 1/4 of the way through my salad when I saw it.  A dead fly.  Seriously?!  I've been in the restaurant and hospitality industry for most of my life. I understand that sh*t happens. BUT when a customer calls to let your kitchen know about the msitake, it's probably not the best practice to ARGUE with her about it.   The lady that answered the phone was really kind of rude. She said she was the manager and she bagged my order to make sure nothing was wrong and she didn't see a fly. I told her that it was buried in the lettuce so it was probably not visible. I also explained that I wasn't looking for another credit or anything like that. (I've been in the restaurant and hospitality industry for many, many years so I know how people can be.) I told her I was just calling to let them know and mentioned that I could send them a picture if she needed. She continued to argue with me as if I was lying.  SO...here it is. The dead fly. In my garden salad. Hopefully, they can use it for training purposes."}
{"text":"Best neighborhood bar in the history of my life living in the valley. I was skeptical at first with such a big menu. How can they be good at all of it? No joke, they rock at the whole damn thing. This is the place to come. Emily is one of the best bartenders I have had the privilege of sitting across the bar from."}
{"text":"Terrible place! I ordered a Large 18\" pizza and they accidentally brought out the biggest Monster size pizza 26\" and we already wanted so long so the waiter said just keep it she will take care of it so we did ,when brought the check they charged us for the pizza we did not fucking order which was an extra 18$!!! Manager didn't want to help but it was the waiters fault and she admitted it and still made us pay for something the waiter fucked up on!"}
{"text":"Ordered walnut salad with no cheese. Soup of the day, 2 slices of pizza as zucchini.    After 30 min we got the zucchini.  Then two salads appeared not soup.  Sent back. Then pizza 20 min later. No sign if the walnut salad.  Hour later the salad came with cheese and we where told they where making the soup of the day.      We send back the salad canceled the soup and paid the $30 bill for zucchini and two small slices of pizza.    Horrible service by bartender.  One other tables that arrived after us where in and out."}
{"text":"Good shrimp Alfredo great side salads! Slow service and dishes dirty but those are easy fixes"}
{"text":"I got pizza and wings. The pizza crust they use is amazing. The wings are really good too"}
{"text":"Food is a 3, service is a 1. I don't have a service horror story but I've been in three times and it's frustrating to have to constantly flag someone down to get a menu, get a refill, ask why the food is taking a half hour to come out, ask for the check, etc. etc. Food is better than most bar food but I wouldn't make a trip here just to eat or to pick up take out. Employees seem disinterested and not particularly friendly or helpful. On one visit, I sat at the bar and the young woman took a 15 minute hiatus to go socialize on the patio with a customer she apparently knew, meanwhile we just had to wait for her to get back. This location has been many things over the years and we were hoping something good would finally end the curse but it doesn't look like Maya is it. Again, the food isn't horrible but it's not to the level that it makes up for the complete lack of understanding of how to provide customer service."}
{"text":"not the best $35 I've ever spent, feel a little ripped off. bags of ranch and wing sauce instead of cups.... pretty sad. The worst part is pepperoni pizza had about 13 pepperoni on 1/2 and only 4 on the other half. only reason for the stars is wings had decent flavor."}
{"text":"The wings and pizza are really but its pretty pricey. My girlfriend and i ate here enjoyed the food and drinks but when w saw are bill it came out to be $40+ with tip. Haven't been back due to the price but if you have money to spend and looking for some good wings and pizza i would recommend this place"}
{"text":"As a somewhat regular since I have lived across the street from Maya since it opened a few years ago, I am absolutely stunned reading the bad reviews on this wonderful place. But, when I look at some of the reviewers other reviews, they seem to have the same complaints about half the places they go. Maybe that should tell you something...? As for what I can say... I have never once, in the 50+ times I have been there, have had bad service or bad food. Staff comes and goes as it does at every restaurant, but a few have been there for quite some time. Get to know the owner \"Moose\". He really is a great guy that cares about his customers.  There is never a cover charge for fight nights, they has live entertainment, karaoke, comedy... ALWAYS something fun to do! The pizza is delicious, salads are enormous, The pasta dishes come with amazing meat sauce, everything is so good! And the wings.... Ohhhhh, those wings. Try the Golden Spicy, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Huge, meaty, succulent wings that must have been taken from angel chickens!! Taco night on Tuesday is also top notch! Do yourself a favor and try this place for yourself."}
{"text":"Every time I have ordered (3rd time now) the food comes nice and hot, and has good flavor considering it survived a car ride! We ordered something different every time, with the exception of the burger... that's my husbands favorite item and he sticks to what he likes. I love the Greek salad. Enjoying the chicken Parmesan tonight! Thanks Maya for delivering, both of our cars are out of commission, it was a dinner saver!"}
{"text":"I would NOT recommend this place due to their lousy service and poor food. I went on a Sunday around 6:30 pm and was seated at a dirty table. We were given our menus and waited 15 minutes for any form of beverage. When the waitress came to take our order she was completely rude, did not look at us when taking our order, did not write anything down then came back 3 times to make sure she remembered correctly. When our food did arrive we had to wait five minutes for plates, then she informed us that a salmon dish that was ordered could not be made because they were out of salmon, really?? isn't this something were should of heard before our food was done, giving us time to place another order. Eventually the wings arrived, but with no sauce on them when they were suppose to be hot wings. While we were there people around us were all getting the wrong orders as well. Clearly this waitress should not be in the food service industry if she cannot perform her job. She will be the reason I will never return"}
{"text":"Their customer service is poor here and the place isn't very clean. The food was alright I won't be coming back here"}
{"text":"We got a group on and had never heard of this place. The food was all great and the service. They were setting up live music as we were leaving so will need go back now. We shared a large Greek salad and extra large Brooklyn pizza between 4 of us. We also ordered a pizza for delivery that weekend but prefer to go to the restaurant so the crust stays crispy."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was 5 stars. We came for lunch and had a great experience. The waitress was friendly and the food and drinks were good. This was before happy hour and I ordered a well Tequila Sunrise and was charged $4 or $4.50, which was just fine. We came back for dinner another day and this time it was during happy hour which they advertise $3.50 well drinks and I ordered 2 well Tequila sunrises with our dinner. When I got the check I noticed a total charge for both drinks of $14 so I mentioned it to the waitress and she asked what time I ordered my drinks. I confirmed it was before the 630 pm end time for happy hour and she double checked and came back and said the price is correct, that the $3.50 well is just for the tequila, the extra charge is for the grenadine. So then when I inquired further bringing up the fact that it was less than $5 for the same drink NOT during happy hour I was told the previous waitress charged me incorrectly and that the even though it was a 'well' tequila sunrise, that the will charge double for adding OJ to the drink. I don't know where they buy their orange juice but if it is costing them as much as the tequila then they should look elsewhwre. I have paid $4 for a glass of OJ while eating breakfast at places, but the was not a glass of orange juice, it was on top of the tequila I was paying for in a short glass. So I give this place a 3 star review for the overpriced drinks that make no sense and for the lack of good customer service. I am usually not one to write a bad review but this place put a bad taste in my mouth and we won't be returning. One simple thing could have changed that and made us returning customers but since they refused to help, or honor what their advertised special, we won't be returning.  Make sure to verify prices before ordering!"}
{"text":"Update: The drink Mesa Monsoon is Magnificent!!  I am a weekly regular here now.    Stromboli is amazing.  We ordered take out this past weekend.  So good I LOVE it.  Even ate it cold the next day.  Mouth is watering  just thinking about it.   Yep that is right, my husband and I give this place 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! The service was great and so was the food.  We will be back for sure.  It is great to have an individual pizza place close to our house. We get sick of always having the usual chain pizza.    My husband ordered the Stromboli which was HUGE just like the waitress said.  Over a foot long and very good.  I had the Chicken Kabobs.  They had a lot if flavor and were juicy and tender.  I enjoyed the main dish so much I nearly forgot to tell you about the hummus.  The hummus was perfect and my husband loved the marinara so much he ended up asking for some to go.  This from a man who never gets leftovers.   Anyway yes this place is amazing and you should probably go. Don't listen to the first reviews.  Many of those people seem fake with their one star and no profile pictures.  Can't wait until next time."}
{"text":"I won't critique the service since our server was on her first day. But the food? Ugh. Simply dreadful. We got the appetizer sampler and it was all pretty much brought in frozen stuff (I'm pretty sure the mozzarella sticks were the same ones I get from Costco). They weren't particularly bad, but they weren't really good either. Two people ordered the Greek gyros wrap, and I've left more gyros scraps on some plates from good Mediterranean places than these sandwiches had. Another party member had the Philly cheese steak and said it was the worst she ever had. We left the food uneaten.   The only reason why I give it two stars is because the owner comped the whole meal, including the edible (though by no means good)  appetizers, so it was actually decent for what we paid, but I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Who the heck puts processed cheese on a pizza as a topping!!?? When your menu states \"Cheddar Cheese\" you need to use REAL cheese. That just ruined my whole evening, Disgusting!!  Not to mention the crappy service and horrific attitude of the bartender, what a Bitc#!! This was our first and last time ordering here. On a plus side, the wings are really good! At least the spicy gold flavored are. So Two stars for that reason."}
{"text":"Maya's is a great place to eat and have fun, the weekly entertainment is definitely a plus, the idiot that left the negative statement regarding thugs is only a washed up wannabe gambler, the wannabe high roller is playing free craps for a $15.00 food voucher and  he's the biggest loser everytime he plays.  Mr. Idiot go get yourself a life or maybe you should switch to Bingo, a change of wardrobe wouldn't hurt either, the Tom Jones look is over."}
{"text":"Food wS poor and the service is the worst I have ever had. I will NOT comeback here again. I had a pizza and I have had better frozen pizza. If the crust was homemade, I am the President of the United States.   If I could rate this place a no star I would. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Food was really good, waitress/hostess (same person even though she didn't know) no name tag or introduction and apparently no knowledge of who was currently working as waitress even though she was the hostess. Although she was not the most profesional wait staff we have ever had but the correct food came out in a timely manner and she kept our drinks fresh. Food was really good (better than native across the street) we got the app sampler and white pizza and I would definitely get both again, Next time I wil be trying the mediterranean side of the menu. Once they get their wait staff straightened out this will be a very nice 5 star joint."}
{"text":"Food is good. Wings are very good too but service kinda sucks and manager needs to work on customer service skills and they shouldn't accept Groupon or restaurant.com if they aren't going to abide by them and make us feel stupid for purchasing them."}
{"text":"We had the antipasto salad and the Bronx pizza - both were very good and the service was good too. I would definitely come back here next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Diann was a very nice server.  The Bronx pizza was yummy and garlic knots delish.  The Maya Antipasta salad was HUGH and amazing.  We will defiantly return when we are in town again."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to have a non-chain pizza place in the neighborhood. First impression: clean, nice menu selection, not so great service. The thing that struck me the most was the smell of cigarette smoke when we walked in the front door. Yep, they allow smoking on the patio and they keep the doors open into the restaurant. Nothing like eating with an ashtray. Isn't that illegal anyways?! Check out smokefreearizona.com .   The food was really good and came out quicker than we expected. We ordered medium wings and they weren't spicy but very crisp and tasty. Supreme pizza was great!   Hubs ordered a gyro and was expecting pita bread but it came in a wrap form. Was still very good- just not what he expected.  Thy have a kids section on the menu but I wouldn't say it was \"kid-friendly\". Okay to bring kids but I wouldn't after 5pm."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times. The food has always been great. Last night I ordered amazing wings and a huge calzone.no complaints, servers are nice and prices are great, would def recommend and will be back. Again and again and again"}
{"text":"So, ordered from Grub Hub (maybe my first mistake) then waited over ONE HOUR AND A HALF for the wrong pizza. The driver kept calling me to notify me she was running late, which was nice,  but as expected pizza came chilled, late and again WRONG items on pizza. Going to skip them from now on. First pizza I got from them had a great crust and taste, the second one substandard,  the veggies tasted a bit dated, crust was tasteless. As you know, third time was not a charm. At least someone from the restaurant should call you and apologize; over an hour and a half for pizza and not a courtesy call?! Great customer service fail. I guess I should have canceled but I was being patient. Hope they treat their eat-in customers better. Skip their delivery."}
{"text":"Overall great place!! We come here already twice a month it's in a great location to us and I love their pizza. Just DO NOT GO ON A SUNDAY! We went out to dinner on a Sunday a girlfriend of mine and myself and our waitress had been drinking and was horrible. She questioned everything I ordered, tried hitting on me, our drinks were empty the whole time and worst of all, SHE FLUNG HER HAIR INTO OUR FOOD. She also made us clean up the table and waved her hand in my face telling us what to pick up. Her breath was a constant mix of cigarette and beer. Yes  we will continue to go, just never on a Sunday, and if I ever get this waitress again, I'm leaving right away!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot, especially on Thursdays when they do trivia night - fun!!  Love the calzones & pizza.  Really good hummus too!"}
{"text":"I too was excited that this restaurant opened and I have to agree with most that posted on here.  Each time I come here, now 4 times, the place is not busy most times empty and the waitresses have no clue how to make someone feel welcome or provide service. It's obvious that the waitresses are only there to socialize with each other and if you ask for something you're bothering them.  While  food most times is good it's also  unpredictable.  What a frustrating dining experience.  As good as their pizza is most times, I will not ever be back."}
{"text":"Food is subpar and the live music sounds like someone brought back dead singers using voodoo but they got the spell wrong and they resurrected tone deaf cover band versions of the singers."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant and was seated by the hostess. She took my drink order, she said she would give a few minutes to peruse the menu. Now here's where it started getting weird. This 1 dude walked to the opposite side of the table and began staring at me. When I looked up to him he winked at me and walked away. I figures he was an employee and when the hostess returned I ordered the lasagna. A few minutes later she began apologizing and said that my table had been previously was being seated by another customer who wanted it back, thus the winking dude. She kicked me off the table, lol."}
{"text":"I hate giving this place two stars when the food was so good. Lasagna was great. Wings were amazing and big. But never came to refill drinks even once . Took 30 minutes just to take order. Not like it was packed. Just need to break down and hire some service staff. Whoever is in the kitchen did a great job."}
{"text":"I'm a huge foodie and the Gold Wings here are the best in AZ... Much better then Oregano's,  Natives,  Barros, Toby Keith's, Hooters, Buffalo Wild Wings,  etc.   The pizza was cooked perfect with a crunchy crust, just the way I like it.   The specialty drinks were worth the money,  got a good buzz from the Mesa Monsoon. Not sure why this place has poor reviews, my experience was awesome. Service was fast."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of some friends who told us they enjoyed it.  We came on a Saturday night, it was practically empty, and once we got our food, it was painfully evident why this was the case.  For starters, the booth tables are disastrously grungy looking. The wait staff, while quick to get us our order, wasn't particularly happy to be there, she's just going through the motions, and you can pick up on this rather quickly. Not an eager-to-serve mentality going on there.  We started with cheese sticks... they arrived semi-burnt to a crisp with a tough recently-unfrozen texture on the cheese inside. Stay away from those if you can.  For the main course, my friends ordered Chicken Parm and Alfredo, and being the pasta fanatic I am, I went for the Lasagna. My lasagna arrived on a hot plate, the lasagna itself, not quite so hot as the plate. One taste and it was immediately apparent to me this was reheated in the microwave Lasagna. The food arrived too quickly to have been made fresh. For 9.99? NOT worth it. I can get better tasting frozen lasagna for 7.99 at Walmart. Avoid at all costs. My friends' entrees fared no better. Being a pizza bar and grill, perhaps our mistake was ordering pasta... but with this level of quality on the pasta (Michelina's frozen pasta tastes just as good at a fraction of the price and you don't have to see an unsmiling, uncaring waitress) you should probably order the wings other folks here are recommending. Me? I cannot find myself coming back with this frankly underwhelming food."}
{"text":"The food here was tasty but it wasn't the quality I expected for an Italian pizza, the flavor wasn't there. Being a bar the bar food was great the fried zucchini and fries were perfectly made, disappointed in the store bought strawberry drenched syrup cheesecake."}
{"text":"Maya's, enjoy the food, not happy with the service.  Called in an order and they confirmed the CC number by repeating it out loud. Would have preferred if they asked me to repeat and they confirmed that way. They use personal phones to make calls and when the delivery guy called and asked for the number again, we cancelled the order. The caller ID was a personal phone so we did not give the card number. I would like to see a business ID , because anybody could say they were an employee. Called the manager to voice our concern. They were understanding of our concern , but said that is their practice and no one has complained before. Like I said, great food, but not happy with the service."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's been a hot minute since I have been here!  I was pleasantly surprised on this visit. I not only had great service but the food was great. A total shout out to my sever/bartender Jess(?). Anyhow what a great experience, thank you guys and I look forward to my and my families next visit!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and have been very pleased with the food. Generally I eat at a place and kind of forget about it, but I was craving to go back here. The menu is very confusing, but once you figure it out you'll be ok. The 1st pizza I tried was the Maya Special. So beyond delicious! I'm still craving it since I didn't have it the 2nd time. 2nd pizza was the Queen Margherita. It was good. A lot of garlic, which some people probably would hate, but I love garlic so it was fine. There are tons of choices for a vegetarian as well. I have a difficult time picking each visit. The crust is really good as well. I haven't seen anyone leave the crust behind yet. I hope that more people get on here and appreciate it because I'd like to see it stick around."}
{"text":"I was willing to let go and not leave a negative review that my pizza came late (even though I live less than 1 mile away) and showed up pretty cold as well but the disgusting wings were too much. Cold and lacking sauce, very low meat quality yes but it was the fur that was disgusting. What is this in my photo? Animal fur, someones hair? My husband thinks it is a feather. It was definitely cooked into it, it did not come from my home because I could not pull all these hairs out!! How could they miss that? Do they think cold, late food covered in feathers is acceptable? The first time we tried the pizza we really liked it but I just cannot go back. I deserve a refund. Absolute worst experience I have had in the four years I've lived here at any restaurant."}
{"text":"let me start by quoting another user since i had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM  'I travel across town because I bought a Groupon for this place.  It was a $20 Groupon and they wouldn't credit me with the entire amount. They said they had to take out the tax...   Huh?  There was additional tax added to the receipt!  They said that's how they do it...   What?  I talked to Groupon after, and they said, No, that's not how it's done, so don't fall for it!'  pizza was ok, nothing great. the server was attentive and nice but pretty clueless (had to explain what i meant by needing a garlic shaker...at a pizza place(?) told us wrong specials of the day, etc) the real problem was the bartender/ cashier who is the first person i've dealt with who told me 'oh we don't give the full face value on groupons'. took ten minutes of arguing and her changing her totally illogical excuses multiple times. finally accepted it and acted like she was doing us a special favor. avoid."}
{"text":"Food was good and garlic knots and wings really good. The waitress Mary was super nice and on it and very helpful."}
{"text":"I recently wrote a review about another pizzeria in Phoenix stating that it was the best pizza I've had in the two years I have been in Arizona. Maya New York Pizza Bar has taken over that thrown. I went here two days ago with my wife and kids. The food was really good, the service was even better. We had an XL pizza with pepperoni, garlic knots, chicken parm Stromboli and for dessert brownie with ice cream. Everything was great! I'm originally from New Jersey and we are pretty picky with our pizza but we can not find one complaint with this place. I live in San Tan Valley so this place isn't very close to home but I will definitely being going back soon."}
{"text":"Too bad I cannot give no stars. We went there with high hopes of a good new york pizza joint as my husband is from New York. I had a groupon for 4+ people that expired today. The other two people that were supposed to meet us were unable to. So, it was just me and my husband. I asked if I could still use the groupon. The place was totally dead. The owner was sitting at the table across from us. The waiter said no but he would check with the owner. The owner told him no because we didnt have 4 people. Ok, fair enough. But I asked if I could at least use the $24 I paid for the groupon towards my meal (which is typical groupon policy). The waiter had to check one table over with the owner. The owner said no. Really. I cannot even use the $24 bucks I already paid towards your restaurant? A restaurant that has under 3 stars, is dead, and where I was planning to spend at least 35-40 bucks? Sorry, but that is bad business. No need to say I won't be back. I had hoped to find a good pizza joint (and drove 20 minutes to get there) but unfortunately another dud. And a rude one. We ordered 2 beers, didnt drink them, paid the 7.50 and left. So they got $24 plus the beers. And they didnt deserve the 7.50..... Definitely, would not recommend."}
{"text":"So I felt shorted in my refund by 5.00 now the money is the point they owe me money and I want it today the manger hung up on me DONT GO THERE LOOK AT THEIR 2.5 out of 5 STARS WHAT DOES THAT SAY"}
{"text":"Great service, good garlic knots and decent pizza. The honored a yelp coupon even though the owner said he was losing money on it. Most def go back."}
{"text":"Pizza was terrible, nice guy who took order but pizza's were burnt. I guess if you sat at bar and had a few it would taste better. Place was packed with UFC fighters who had weigh in at this place and I wondered why none of them ate there after weighing in. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great spot. These other people complaining about the time spent waiting obviously don't understand the concept of \"made fresh\". Went in for the first time yesterday with my buddy and the owner who is called Moose treated us like regulars upon the first visit. FREE POOL TABLE BTW. I think I found my new spot. If you live in the downtown Mesa area, Maya Pizza is a place you must try! Thanks good pizza, beer, and hospitality!!"}
{"text":"we were so excited to try this place but were not impressed. if anything we were waited on too fast but that was the least of the problems. the garlic knots we ordered came swimming in grease and barely more than room temp. the fact that it took 3 minutes to get them on the table made us wonder how long they had been sitting out and for who (or is that whom)? then the pizza came out, nothing on the pizza tasted fresh it was all highly processed and probably out of cans or frozen and heated, the dough was bread like. The calzone was 1/3 grease, 1/3 cheese, and 1/3 bad dough. my 7 yr old didn't eat anything... she ordered the cheese pizza. the place seems like it needs to be more of a bar and less of an eatery, there were plenty of TVs, and the drinks were good. I may be back for the wings and maybe taste the Greek (confusing) food section but I cant imagine its better given the quality of the pizza. I am so sorry to write this like i said I really wanted to have a great pizza place to frequent."}
{"text":"On this side of town this is my favorite burger place. Had the 1/2lb cheeseburger with onion rings and wild wings. The food was great. I enjoyed it very much. The delivery was extremely fast. Much faster than I expected. And the delivery person was extremely polite. And enjoyable experience all around."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've ate at Maya, but the very first time we went it was a great dining experience!  My three year old had just gotten hurt as we were walking in and we got seated with a crying toddler and asked for drinks. My son loves chocolate milk, so we ordered him that thinking maybe they would have it. Well they didn't have any, but our waiter took the time, along with his own money, to run to the nearest gas station and get my son some chocolate milk! So the service is wonderful!   The food was fabulous also! I had the mushroom Swiss burger and fries. My burger was done to perfection, and my fries came out piping hot. Their prices are that of a sports bar & grill, very reasonable!   This is a very nice tucked away little spot! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Nothing was right not the food not the ticket 47 dollars for 2 people all we had was one slice of pizza some fries and wings which were very small. We didnt get put happy hour discount.  Was charged 2 dollars for a tea spoon of cheese added to fries. Flies everywhere bevause they leave dpors open amd u can smell smoke fron patio. I had to cover all our plates with napkins to keep the flies off."}
{"text":"Not a good place for big groups, order 3 pizzas and they tell us they can't make all pizzas at one time? what kinda pizza place can't bake 3 pizzas at one time? Figures it was very empty. The noise level was unbearable. Over priced for quality. The service was okay but the manager was not polite to the costumers. will not be returning. i dropped my knife on the floor and they would not give us another silverware. they also shorted us 2 plates and asked us to share plates! very confused extremely confused about this place."}
{"text":"We have been to Maya's many times since it first opened.  In the restaurant and delivery.  I originally gave them 4 stars as the food was consistently good.  The last 4 times have really been poor.  The flavor and quality of the food had really diminished.  The food now tastes like it was frozen and heated up in a microwave.  It's sad because we ate there often."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday to watch a Raider Game. There was one guy in the middle of the bar watching the Dallas Game. He swore, yelled, talked to the TV. He personally ruined any efforts for anyone else to enjoy their own game. The bartenders never asked him to be quiet. Just let him continue to be obnoxious. I could not bring my parents or other family members here as he was so bad. His language and antics were horrible and it seemed as if he was a regular there. It's too bad, thus place had potential."}
{"text":"I have always had great delivery service. We always order the wings and soda. They always remember the soda. They say they will be there in 45- an hour. They typically are early but I appreciate the honesty with delivery times. Most companies over promise quick delivery, Barros is honest about times. I highly recommend their wings and garlic bread"}
{"text":"The pizza here is very good. I ordered a pepperoni 16\". I thought the food was fresh and tasted just like pizza from NY. We also had the garlic knots which were also very good. I am not a fan of pizza but this one is a great pizza place! I will be back for sure maybe even try wings next!"}
{"text":"I really love this place.  Absolutely delicious pizza and pasta in a place with a neighborhood bar feel to it.  I'm there at least once every month and it's priced properly.  I can't believe that it's not busier than it is, but they've opened a second location so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night and I came away feeling pretty good about them.  The burger was great - very tasty and filling.  Service was friendly, and they had my order ready right at 5:45, as I had previously instructed.  I live around the corner from them and will definitely be coming back!  Thanks, Maya!"}
{"text":"This place is a shithole. However it's pretty damn decent pizza.   Get it well done as they have a tendency to undercook it and it's soggy."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good drinks, amazing Stromboli and the bartender Emily is so sweet. There's always a seat at the bar. Try it, you'll like it! Everything on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, terrible food.  We were sick for a few days after we ate here.  My fork had cheese dried on it.  I realize it's fairly new but come on....."}
{"text":"Tonight we ordered in and tried out a new place. Maya NY  Pizza, we had the stromboli, golden spicy wings and the Buffalo chicken sub. The stromboli was very tasty I would recommend that for sure.       The wings, we asked for sauce on the side but they came covered, no big deal but we prefer them dry. Not sure what the golden sauce is but it was tasty.         The Buffalo chicken sub was disappointing as it had no sauce or garnish. It was just buffalo chicken on a bun. I put my own blue cheese dressing on at home, saved it a little. The sub was supposed to come with a side salad but we did not receive that.      We ordered a two liter of Sprite and instead got Diet Coke. All in all it was alright food but too many mistakes in the order for my taste. The restaurant was nice enough to call and ask me if we ordered twice and had food going to two seperate addresses...No we did not but thanks for asking! We will see if we ended up paying twice, I hope not as we payed enough for what we got and what we didn't get.      My husband gives the stromboli 4 stars but the salad we did not get 0 stars...and he hates Diet Coke."}
{"text":"Terrible experience...  New York pizza?  Uh, no...  It was sliced into 3\" squares, so before even tasting it I knew it wasn't going to be a New York style pie.  The crust was horrible.  Bland, tasteless, burned, and cardboardish.  The service was very slow and the restaurant was nearly empty.   I travel across town because I bought a Groupon for this place.  It was a $20 Groupon and they wouldn't credit me with the entire amount. They said they had to take out the tax...   Huh?  There was additional tax added to the receipt!  They said that's how they do it...   What?  I talked to Groupon after, and they said, No, that's not how it's done, so don't fall for it! Oh, also, when I paid the balance they shorted me $10 in change.  The waiter said he made a mistake.  It was a huge cluster and when it was over, I didn't even have a good pizza to enjoy."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was horrible.  Food took forever, orders didn't come out together. Drinks took forever and couldn't even get them right. Bill was incorrect and took forever to fix.  They treat you like a friend who is irritating them, not customers. Sad, because it's so close to home."}
{"text":"We were literally a table of seven people the only table in the whole restaurant, and we didn't see our waitress for 15 minutes at a time, SEVEN PEOPLE ,the ONLY people in the whole place . The food was okay nothing special . Super embarrassed for the whole company .."}
{"text":"Great White Pie Pizza and amazing Golden Spicy boneless wings. By far the best flavor of wings I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Maya's, place is way slow on service busy or dead, space cadets as workers, way to loud on club nights, I would pass on this place. But the fights are a interesting approach to being a hotspot."}
