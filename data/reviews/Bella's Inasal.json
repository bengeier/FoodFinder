{"text":"Umorder kami ng 'All-you-can eat Rice' (kain ng kanin hanggang kaya) boneless bangus, at All-you can eat liempo, at sizzling beef steak. Yung boneless bangus ay hari, malaking piraso ang bangus at may is mangkok khi sinangag na kanin, may atsara sa hiwalay ng lit-mangkok.  Malasa din yung all-you-can-eat rice w/Liempo.  parang Tosino, baws tamis at hindi pula. Medyo malutong ang labas.  Binigyan kami ng kutsilyo pan hiwa.  Nabigo ako sa sizzling beef steak kasi, parang pina-init lang sya na lumang luto, at hindi sya 'sizzling', di dapat tinawag na sizzling beef steak, kundi beef steak sa bakal ng plato.  4 twen ang score kasi, di kami tinipid sa rami ng kanen at kanin, di matagal ang hintay sa orders, maayo ang lokasyon (Burnhamthorpe Rd W & WolfDale), mabait ang staff, may 'kaon ta' na T-shirt pa.  Maluwang ang lugar, hindi randam na masikip, resto feel hindi karindirya/turo-turo feel na kainan.  At sa order namin all-you-can-eat rice, busogin.  Ang ayoko lang yung 'Sizzling' Beeft Steak na order, medyo luma tingnan at hindi sya sizzling (di ko alam kung anong term nito sa Pilipino)- o walang latoy.  Kung ikukumpara ko sa ibang Pinoy resto, halimbawa Berto's, mas gusto ko ang Bella's Inasal sa unang upuan, maluwang at hindi tinitipid ang porsyon ng kanen, at sa desenteng presyo.  Dahil dito ay rekomend ko na subokan nyo ang Bella's Inasal.  Siguro ito ang pikh-panalo sa mga Pinoy restos sa 'Sauga (kumpar sa Berto's, B's Sizzling Kitchen, Handaan) sa aklat ko."}
{"text":"3.5 stars   We went on a weekday night. The place is small so I'm not sure if it gets packed on weekends.  I like their chicken inasal and would go back for that. The crispy pata is also good. Don't order the grilled squid. The dish costs $12 and all we got was a small squid (about 6 inches long). It also didn't taste good. If you want grilled squid, just go to Seafood City.   The lady who served us was friendly and service was pretty quick. Toilet is clean.   They also have whole chicken inasal. I'd like to go back and try that."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for the \"next\"  Filipino restaurant that have fair prices and has a great flavour obviously. So far this place is legit.  Came here to do a takeout and they we're pretty fast. Friendly service as usual, it's the Filipino hospitality. This place took over Tandoori Chicken. This place is good for family/ friend gatherings or a quick lunch meet up, which is great for me when I'm in a hurry to get back to work.   Looking at the menu, you really can't go wrong with their breakfast dishes such as tapsilog, longsilog, etc. It comes with rice, calamansi, and atchara which is a sweet pickled thinly sliced papaya great with anything fried/grilled. I have yet to try their array of breakfast options but Instead i went for the 'Rice all you can' section! That's right! Unlimited rice with your dish! I obviously ordered their Inasal, and their Liempo as they were the top 2 most recommended dishes.   O.M.G the chicken exceeded my expectations! Great flavour and nice grilled taste. The soy sauce, calamansi, and atchara with the chicken is just delicious! I highly recommend it! I tried the liempo and they were very flavourful as well but I liked the chicken better.   I ordered the Green Mango shake and was super disappointed! The flavour was lacking and it was a bit watery. By the time I got home it had separated and tasted weird. I do not recommend it.  I will definitely be coming back for some breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is not consistent.   The first time that we went there. Food was pretty awesome - we tried their combo special and it came with sizzling sisig na bangus (milk fish), chicken Inasal, rice, 2 pop and leche flan. Service was fast and the food was delicious.   We came back and tried their boodle menu which came with Lechon, chopsuey, red eggs, mango salad & rice. We also ordered the sizzling sisig na bangus. We were disappointed that the food was cold. We had a cold chopsuey & cold sisig. The sizzling sisig didn't sizzle at all and it took a long time for the egg to cook. We told the server about the food."}
{"text":"Newly opened Filipino restaurant along Burnhamthorpe and Wolfdale Road. This restaurant features classic Filipino dishes, and desserts. Affordable price, and there is nothing more Filipinos would love other than UNLIMITED RICE on their meals.  Price is affordable. They offer on the house soup -which tasted okay. Food takes a little long to be served which is a little bit of a downside.    Tip: they do have BOODLE, too!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The customer service was excellent and we even met the owner. He was very accomodating.   I tried Sizzling Sisig, hmmmmmm...to die for.  So why only 4Star? Oh well, blame the Parking Area, not enough to accomodare customers during their busy hours. I had to park across the Plaza."}
{"text":"Found my Bacolod style inasal! They offer a variety of food too, from sisig to shanghai and of course unlimited rice! Its a small resto so the place can be packed most of the time. Service is fast and great! Would definitely keep coming back!"}
