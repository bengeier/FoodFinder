{"text":"This is the place for the best hot dogs ever - once you try them you will be hooked and be an instant repeat customer - friendly staff - hometown feel and great food mmmm!  Try the Salsa its so amazing and truly an award winner - so glad my wife found this place I will be there often."}
{"text":"Great place in Fountain Hills where you can get amazing hot dogs liken to Chicago, Detroit, KC, and yup even Sonoran. The make them just like the aforementioned big cities. A true Mom & Pop gem tucked away in Fountain Hills. This is that secret spot you tell your friends about. Awesome joint!"}
{"text":"Love this place and it's down to earth owners.  Seattle dog is amazing...salsa is to die for"}
{"text":"This place is great! The hot dogs are delicious and creative. There are the classic dogs as well such as the Chicago Dog, which are great! The people are nice, and the dogs are tasty.  They have footlongs too!"}
{"text":"Owner was great and stayed open to serve these hungry travelers.  Had the Philly dog and it was yummy.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs!  I had the chili dog with nacho cheese and jalape√±os!   The dog AND the chili were SO good.  My husband likes his with just mustard and green onions, so JR fixed it just right for him.  JR and Teresa own the restaurant, and are so fun to talk to. When you go there, you will immediately feel like they are your friends.   It is most definitely a place to put on your list of favorites! !!"}
{"text":"This business is now located at the Fry's plaza at 43rd Ave. and Cactus.  I tried it today for the first time and had the Sonoran Dog with a side of pintos and cheese. Dog was loaded with toppings and beans were creamy.  Two thumbs up and welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great food... Great people. I have been here several times and never disappointed. If your looking for a quick bite this will hit the spot"}
{"text":"Great hotdog, nice service, must try!"}
{"text":"JR and Tee are the best. My daughter and I went to the new location at the Indoor swap-meet (43rd Ave & Thunderbird). I fell in love with the Santa Fe dog. I will be letting everyone I know about this little gem."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Hot dogs weren't very warm.   All beef dogs would be better.   Tasty options.  Frito pie tastes like Hormel on top of fritos.  Don't get me wrong,  I ate it all!   Just an honest review.   Very friendly owners and very good salsa!"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! I don't know what hotdog place Robert M is going too but he must be mistaken. Especially because the pricing he gave is completely wrong for a Carolina dog. Every single one of my friends and family who have eaten here absolutely love it and they have the best gourmet hotdogs I've ever had. They also will work with you on what you want. They are super friendly and kind. Best salsa ever too!! They have lots of awards and have won a ton of contests for this salsa. The shop is just great from taste to their quality to their customer service. You feel like a part of the family when you've left the shop because they are so wonderful and they converse with you a lot. They are excellent in every way. I've been here a lot and will continue to come here whenever I want some delicious hot dogs!! Mmm!"}
{"text":"Just took a casual day trip up to Fountain Hills and stumbled on Hometown Dogs. WOW!  I am a Matlock when it comes to hot dogs and my girlfriend is just so so on hot dogs.  Well even she loved her Philly dog.  I had the Chicago, which I can never pass up, even though they had a Detroit dog and that's where I'm from!  Love those Chicago Dogs.  I also only eat Vienna Hot Dogs.  Well the brand they use is fabulous.  I was very pleased.  Also got a sample of the award winning salsa - excellent.  The Hot Dogs are over sized and the trimmings are just perfect.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hometown Dogs is great!  The Hotdogs are fresh and extra large, the homemade tamales with toppings of your choice are a special item I LOVE when they have them available. The Salsa is so darn good we have to buy every member of the family their own container or we fight over it! You gotta try it! They spice it to your liking right on the spot!  Just go there! you will see!"}
{"text":"Had the Sonoran dog. Bacon wrapped dog in a bun with onions peppers and chili with a dressing on top.   For a hot dog, these are pretty amazing!  I can't wait to go back and try their other specialty dogs!  They also sell homemade salsa and a green chile (for real green chile!!!) sauce which is out of this world!    The people are really friendly and the place is spotless!  I only wish they were open later!!"}
{"text":"Great dogs close to home...  J.R. Has a large menu of specialty dogs along with great sides!  Have definitely found the best dogs in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this little mom and pop shop and BOY oh BOY were we glad we did. The owner was SO friendly and answered all our questions. My husband ordered a hotdog (he forgot the name - it had slaw and thousand island dressing on it)  he LOVED IT!!!! The bread was so soft and delish. The owner of Hometown dogs also won a competition for her salsa and gave our group a sample and OH MY GOODNESS, we were in HEAVEN!!!!!!!  If you're looking for a dog at decent prices and you want your taste buds to be AWAKEN, then you MUST stop here!!!!!!!  I highly recommend Hometown Dogs!!!! Can't wait to come again when we visit Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"I'll have to strongly disagree with this Robert guy, the employees there have only ever been kind to my friends and I. We came as much as we could and were treated with hotdogs better than anywhere else I've been in the valley, with great prices and exceptional quality.   These people show so much passion for their work, it's hard to believe anybody would speak poorly of them, and with so little actual information nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had the Sonoran and my husband had the Pastrami both of which were excellent!! It's totally worth stopping in. The service was excellent. They were super friendly. The food was freshly made to order. I wish it was closer to my home because I'd come here regularly."}
{"text":"Great food!! And dogs and they also have veggie dogs!! And so cheap in prices! The green chili pie....omg!"}
{"text":"Dropped by here for lunch and we are so glad we did!   Hometown dogs has a mom n pop feel to it and it is a small restaurant. Jr and Tee, the owners were amazing and made the experience worthwhile! The service could make this place five stars but let's talk about the food. I ordered a combo dog with chili, nacho cheese, and jalapenos with a side of the green chili pie. For $6.99 it was unbelievable! The hot dog was great, chili was great, and the toppings enhanced the whole thing (what does nacho cheese not enhance??) The green chili pie was green chili pork covered fritos with onions and cheese and was also delicious! Where else are you going to find a green chili pie as a side?? Someone said it before but I'll say it again, the sides here are AWESOME.  My sister got  mushroom and swiss dog and also liked it a lot. She got the frito pie and ate it even though she doesn't like chili. That's how good it is! There are also tons of different options that all look amazing so we will definitely be back. (and a punch card to motivate us)  Their dogs are really good and have a nice snap to them and are super filling. For $16 total, you can't beat it! They also have award winning salsa that we will also be back to try out."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place during one of the festival of the arts.  The atmosphere is quaint, very friendly, and has a nice down-home feel to it.  The hot dogs are the best, with a wide variety of toppings (try the Nana Tee dog), but if you like bratwurst, I highly recommend it.  We also tried Nana Tee's salsa, of which I was curious, having numerous awards displayed, but I'd have to say those awards were well deserved.  I will be coming back for some more."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I and our min-pin chihuahua headed up to the fountain and Yelped for lunch. The food was great and Molly (boss) was SO nice! My boyfriend said its cool cause there's no where else you would get that combination hotdog and it was delicious! It was a cute little place and we'd totally go back.  :) They even gave me a doggie hotdog to-go for our dog!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have made hometown dogs a regular lunch spot and we love it! There is no end to the variety of tasty dogs and yummy sides, although the salsa alone makes the place worth stopping by.  The owner is very passionate about his menu and the service is caring. As the name suggests, there is a community around the shop. Many customers are regulars and with good reason.  Yummy food, and great people make Hometown dogs a must."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, friendly people. We live in Fountain Hills and have been here twice.  This time had the \"Carolina\" dog, the special of the day - quality jumbo dog, quality roll, homemade coleslaw, homemade Mac and cheese, baked beans and bacon. Delish!!!  We'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop shop. Service was outstanding as they clearly enjoy all the business they receive. The potato salad was seriously awesome, clearly homemade. I got the nacho chili dog and it was delicious.   My wife got the philly with homemade pasta salad, both really good. If we lived in the area I'd definitely support this place on a weekly basis. Highly recommended for a quick delicious lunch."}
{"text":"I stopped in this place when I had an hour for lunch and I'm glad I did. The owner/cook was very friendly and made my food right there. I was the only person for the late lunch and she was great company. The food was outstanding! Her salsa was delicious and I ended up buying a jar. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If you haven't experienced the delight that is Hometown Hotdogs-- take an afternoon and grab a dog!!!  The owners immediately make you feel welcome-- they invite you in with hospitality and genuine service.  I come for hotdogs at least once each week. Their menus are fun, explorative, and everything is delectable (the sides are homemade as well as many of the toppings.)  I implore you, for your own sake, don't miss out on this opportunity to support an establishment who deserves your time and money."}
{"text":"We were shocked at how good these dogs were! I had the ny dog and my husband had the Sonoran dog. The salsa was made fresh for that one. The sauerkraut on the by dog was rough chopped and amazing. A must try if you're in the area. Service was super friendly as well! We enjoyed ourselves at this quaint little place"}
{"text":"If you are craving an excellent dog from around the Midwest go here.  Whether Chicago, Detroit, wherever you can get an authentic dog the way you remember. I can't wait to go back."}
