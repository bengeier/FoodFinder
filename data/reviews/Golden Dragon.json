{"text":"Went there with a group of six people for dinner on a Sunday night and we were sat at a round table which was so wobbly you couldn't put your elbows on the table...so we all got up and moved over to the next table.  It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come over and wait on us even though there was only two other tables in the entire restaurant.  We ordered drinks, but my daughter wanted a 7up which never came.  After getting up to find the waitress, they finally delivered it only to have it completely flat without any carbonation at all.  Apps came out with the dinners and the soups were cold.  I just got the feeling nobody really cared.  :-(  Got my bill and it was $31.00 for one meal I split with my daughter...Since we had such a large \"group\", they already tacked on an 18% tip...nice for crap service and food!  Never going back."}
{"text":"The Golden Dragon Chinese Restaurant is located right across the street from the China Buffet. It's a little more of a high-end restaurant, with menus that come in the neat little menu folders.  They have a full bar and a menu full of alcoholic and nonalcoholic treat beverages; Pina Coladas and Daiquiris. I got the China Sea ($3.95) and it was so very good! It took me the length of the entire meal to finish it and it was delicious and fruity.  The food comes out looking beautiful. There are pictures of the interior, the dishes and the drink I got on my blog: (http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/05/golden-dragon-chinese-restaurant.html)  The waitress was kind of bossy and misunderstood part of our order, which is the only reason I didn't give it more stars."}
{"text":"We had lo mein and grief rice. Both were very ok. Quantity is also less. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"may 8th, went for lunch, no bok choy again m4th time, substitute i think was shredded lettuce, maybe trying to save money, the owner needs a class on purchasing 101. like a bar with no vodka"}
{"text":"I wanted to get delivery and I hadn't had Golden Dragon in years...the food was pretty awful. The beef skewers were dry and greasy. The crab puffs were all cream cheese...I could not find a single piece of crab meat. The sweet and sour sauce had a metalic taste that reminded me of blood. The Orange chicken didn't taste like orange at all...it was pretty gross--lacked any good flavor. The egg roll had greasy droplets when I tried to break it in half. It was all just overly greasy and lacked any real flavor, just bland food. I also made the orange chicken a combo and they didn't give me egg drop soup. It was a waste of $24 because I didn't like any of the food and only ate a couple bites of each."}
{"text":"I was pleased with my order of hot &spicy soup.  They do have bubble tea which is a plus as well I finally got to try it and I have to say it is a treat.  The staff was very friendly and humorous at times.  I was not disappointed but at the same time not overly impressed,  so if your looking to try out a new Chinese shop or just don't know what to get try this place its worth a second look."}
{"text":"The first time I had food from Golden dragon, I was blown away.  The quality was phenomenal, and the price was insanely low.    The sweet and sour chicken is to die for.  They kill it.  The rice is pretty good too. I actually made a Yelp! account just to review this place because I want everyone to know of how good it is.    The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because my food took longer than I was quoted.  They told me 15 minutes, and it took over 45 minutes.  I did order during lunch time, and I understand that it's their busiest time, but they shouldn't have quoted me 15 if they couldn't deliver. All and all, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"The last few times I have been here the experience has been poor. January I visited the restaurant for a sit down dinner. We got seated in the back and no one came and asked for our order in the 15 minutes we sat there. We finally got up and left. I stayed away until today and order take out. I get home and realized they forget the sauce for my meal. I had to drive all the way back to get there. I asked for a discount but received soup and an egg roll instead. I get home to eat my cold meal and my tasteless sauce."}
{"text":"My family has been eating Golden Dragon since the 90's but we can't ignore the spotty quality of food and poor service anymore.    Tonight we ordered dinner for 4. When we opened our food at home our Cashew Chicken carton had broken open leaking sauce everywhere but rather than give us a new carton the person chose to throw the broken carton inside of a plastic bag for us to deal with. You might think this speaks to their large portion size BUT the Cashew Chicken was almost completely missing chicken.  The Pork Fried Rice had almost no pork!  We were given NO Duck Sauce with our order.  The shrimp was so fishy I had to brush teeth.   I will hold off on anymore specifics but believe me there were other issues with our order tonight. We've had these issues with Golden Dragon before and we usually call and complain or get back in the car and drive 10 minutes back up to get our Duck Sauce. But this is it. For a restaurant with a shameful 3 stars on Yelp the owners should be looking to keep their regulars happy and coming back.  But their issues are so consistent and so broad that it's clear these are all symptoms of a very basic flaw in their business.  They don't care. They are a lazy, mediocre to poor Chinese restaurant in Northeast Ohio. They are satisfied with their three stars.   Don't eat here. We won't."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a Canadian style Chinese restaurant. As a Chinese, our family order golden dragon very often. Because they are serving very Fresh-cut vegetables and less oil. Not MSG as we tasted. The crabmeat cheese wonton, skinny noodles?dry garlic sparibs, general tao chicken are my favorite. The lady who works there is always smiling. Thank you, golden dragon."}
{"text":"Sizzling rice soup was great! Chicken fried rice was really good. Take out was fast and the prices were reasonable. I'll be back to try other entrées."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food and great prices. Their egg rolls and wonton soup are some of the best I have had.  Yes the place is a little out dated and could use some remodeling however food is great. Give it a try"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here and having some great sushi.  I also like the egg rolls and miso soup."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on the restaurant business.  Nor do I have any formal training as a food critic.  However, I imagine there are a few basics that one learns in Restauranteering 101.  1) Your restaurant should not smell of human pee 2) Tables should be free of greasy handprints  3) If you order an item that is not fish, it should not taste like fish 4) Server should not work if they have a phlegmy-sounding cough  One star for a good fortunes not my cookie.  Is it bad to drink hand sanitizer?"}
{"text":"The Chicken with Garlic Sauce is good and egg rolls are okay. The BBQ spare ribs are good. I do not like the crab puffs. The prices seem okay. The only thing I really do not like about this place is the Delivery times. We normally have to wait an hour and a half or more for delivery."}
{"text":"The food at Golden Dragon is awfully good. The prices are even better.  They serve both Chinese and Japanese cuisine in two separate and distinct menus.  The options for food are mind boggling at times.  There is a sushi chef at the bar from open until close who knows how to serve up some pretty respectable fish.   What makes Golden really stand out is the wait staff.  The cooks, servers, and management (which tend to double up on jobs) are very friendly and engage you in conversation, which I found gave the restaurant a \"homey\" feel.  The dining area is very large and nicely decorated, with flowing fountains and a very nice koi pond.  What is surprises me the most is how empty the place seems to be at any hour.  I never have to wait for a table, and even with four or five other parties, the place feels large and can fit many more. I will continue to eat at Golden Dragon, though they may not be the best out there, you certainly can feel and taste they try their hardest to be."}
{"text":"Our Shop is next door and we end of eating here a lot, the online order form is awesome and food is always great and made quickly!"}
{"text":"From the outside you'd think its a generic type of an American style Chinese food.  A fews ago I'd say this is true.  Now it has new life.  Yes there is the Americanized style Chinese food, good but not great but with a chef who worked for Li Wah downtown there is now traditional Style southern Chinese food on the East Side.  Finally  Basically like most Asian food places, you'll have to ask for off menu items.  The OTHER menu has whole lot of other dishes from steamed/pan seared fishes, Hong Kong Style wonton noodle soups to Moi Choi Kow Yuk \"mandarine: Mei Cai Kao Rou\" ( Triple layed pork over chinese mustard greens.) You can also request for special items if you know what you want.      There are other authentic Chinese places on the Eastside but this one is the only southern style place.  Personally I like this place for Chinese food on the Eastside.  Being Asian American, I guess I am more prone to Asian flavors...no brainer right? =)  Seriously go here and order the traditional Chinese food."}
{"text":"Got takeout New Years Eve 2016 for myself as my daughter was in Texas with her soldier. Usually we'd drive to Hanson's at Aurora Rd in Stouffville for the best & freshest Chinese takeout but I'm trying to find a place closer to Newmarket. Wow! This was a mistake!!! My bill was over $40. The Spring rolls and egg rolls were like heavy pieces of lead. Honestly I got tired of chewing! Spring rolls are supposed to be light and crispy. Egg rolls are supposed to have a crunchy shell and the contents should flow right into your mouth that you almost have to consume all of it in one bite. It appears that someone forgot the garlic in my Dry Greasy Garlic Ribs. The Beef Noodle dish was packed into the foil container so hard that the noodles broke into pieces when I tried to get out a forkfull. And when I tried to eat it, I had to spit out a piece of shoe insole that they call \"beef\". Crabmeat Cheese Wonton was pretty good if you like Philly Cream Cheese with a couple dots of Crabmeat stuffed into a pretty flower pocket.  Now the best part was the Chicken Balls! LOL no wonder the High School kids love coming here!They were more like Chicken Nuggets. Actually McDee's are way better! Needless to say, I'm on my way back out to get a Pizza or something....couldn't eat that crap.  Maybe my standards are high, so give it a try if you dare. At least they are Health Dept Approved. Sorry Golden Dragon....but just DO BETTER!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food, I just ask for no MSG"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Best service and awesome flavors. Everytime I fly north I eat here. Awesome every time! Egg foo yung and orange chicken are my favorites. I love the Albuquerque roll. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars for poor service twice in a row. The first time my order was wrong and the second time is a whole different story.  We ordered by phone around 7:15 and they let us know it would be 30 min to a hour. No problem that is fine. We wait 45 min and go in, not only was it not ready but we wait another 25 min. After seeing multiple people come and go, they came out with a box of food that was not ours. After finally getting to the point that they didn't put our order in, they took our order a second time and said it would be out in 10 min. I was expecting a little more than a \"oops sorry\". No discount,  no free egg rolls, nothing. We get home around 9 and our meal looks like it was just thrown together with hardly any veggies.  The food was fine, but not for over $25. I feel like we could have gotten better service and comparable food at panda express."}
{"text":"this place is awesome. they have excellent combo meals esp for lunch the prices are ridiculously low! great value. the food is very yummy and they give generous portions for great prices. love this place."}
{"text":"Food qty is always huge and quality is good.  The place itself is not the most pleasant to look at.  It might need some remodeling.  Luckily I never have gotten sick so far from this place."}
{"text":"As far as Chinese food in Mayfield goes this is probably the best one....honestly that is not saying much but this place is \"okay\". I typically do not order from here very often as their menu is overpriced for the amount of food you get. Definitely more expensive than the average Chinese joint...but the food is pretty good. Nothing exceptional. I enjoy their sweet and sour chicken. Service at tables is always friendly."}
{"text":"I was here with my sisters and with my partner, and we all really enjoyed our meals. The ambiance is rather stereotypical for a Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese restaurant, but the food and the service really make up for it. The host and our server were both extremely friendly and very professional. I had a sushi special which was pretty good, while everyone else ordered Chinese dishes and they all really liked their food. It wasn't the best food I have had, but it was still very good, especially for the price. I would recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Haven't had really good Chinese food in awhile! We got egg rolls and chicken fried rice delivered and it was amazing!! The chicken was fantastic!!! And the delivery was super super fast!!!"}
{"text":"I had eaten here a number of times over the past few years, but over the last year or so the quality of food, and especially the quality of service has declined dramatically.  I kept on giving them another chance every few months, but today I'd had enough.  After mediocre food the last couple of times, and a rude and unhelpful person on the other end of the phone taking orders, today I decided not to even place an order when I was told that the coupon that I'd been saving wouldn't be honoured because it had been given out by the previous owner. If this were the only issue I'd had with the restaurant, then I would have let it slide, and still placed my order; but with the way the owner handled the exchange (he was quite rude and very argumentative), and with the declining and inconsistent quality of the food, I decided to tell him I wouldn't be placing an order after all, nor would I ever again.   I would advise anyone looking for good Chinese food to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place has nice décor and ambiance, and is also spacious and clean.  Whenever I'm in Akron, I always go back here mainly for the sushi and great service. Both the Chinese and Japanese menus have several good selections to choose from.  The food will range from okay to great, depending on what you order.  Unless this is your preference, I do not recommend the chicken and broccoli.  I found it to be very bland.  The staff are very personable.  The second time I came here, I noticed that our server and one other server remembered us and called us by name. Our server also recognized a guest we had with us, who was visiting from outside the country.  Overall, I've always enjoyed coming here and plan to visit the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Ate with a friend at the sushi bar.   ...To be continued.  It's not the best Sushi in the area, but it's good for State-Road Sushi.  The owner is just as friendly as any of the good animal characters in several Disney movies.  I stuck with the usual spicy tuna, but also had some of the large rolls.  Good atmosphere for friends going out for fun or a date.  Moreover, the vestibule smells good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, broad menu, reasonable price, large portion sizes. A welcome treat after the NYC takeout we're used to."}
{"text":"The food is very good except the meat pirces are huge. But the service is horrible. The lady that owns it is so extremely rude you can't enjoy it. She argues if she messes the order saying it's your fault. I'm so disappointed. I like their sizzling rice soup very much but I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"everyone in my office at Larry H Miller Toyota Order from here twice a month and lately we've felt like choosing another place to order from. We usually spend close to $35 each time we ordered and this time we spent $50 & had to pay extra for the Noodles one of my coworkers wanted on the side instead of the rice. Well - she had no problem with the price until she got them. They were tasteless - over cooked and not good at all. They didn't even look like someone would want to eat them .... we are very disappointed."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Owners are very friendly and fun. Love the hot and sour soup, salmon skin roll, crab ragoon, and any of the spicy dishes. Great sushi, the Chai Puss appetizer is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is crazy when you go there.  No music, strange people and a beat up looking restaurant.  That being said, they have cheap and good Chinese food.  The General Tso's platter comes with about 2 white meat chicken breasts and a load of fried rice.  To start you get your choice of soup and some shrimp chips.  All told, lunch for just over six bucks.  The waitress in there is really no-messing-around so make sure that if you get a drink, you call it to her attention when it is empty.  Never hope for a shrimp chip refill either.    Don't worry about having to wait, you never will.  Good place to grab lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We have high tolerance for \"bad\" or Westernized Chinese food, and have actually developed a taste for it. But this one was bad. Dinner package included fried rice, chicken wings, chicken balls, beef with almonds and veggie, G.Tso Chicken and spring roll. Bad.   The restaurant is operated by Mandarin Chinese... So one would assume. Anyways, bad."}
{"text":"Ok so yay im a fan! This place rocks my world. The food is amazing and always good. I will say the only down side is when you order like 2 dinner combination for whatever they give you this little box of rice lol but tons of meat. So like i had my general Tso's chicken (which was soooo good, careful of the spicey because the crap is hot) and this little bed of rice. If you dont care for to much rich then this is the place for you! Kinda on the pricey side and there is no delievery smh but other then those 2 things its really good."}
{"text":"Horrible food. The PuPu platter was over over cooked . My egg drop soup was made with bad eggs. Service took so long. The waitress argued withy boyfriend about the crappy food. I will never go there again. I would rather starve."}
{"text":"I sent an email to the restaurant to let them know how bad our experience was. No reply. They don't care. So I thought I should share this:  Dear Golden Dragon,    We hope that you use this email to your advantage.    It was too bad that our experience at your restaurant was not what we expected. After reading the reviews from yelp, we were very disappointed with your dishes. We tried both menus - Japanese and Chinese. Your sushi was very fishy and it was falling apart when we picked it up with our chop sticks. It was a sign that there was no care in preparing the dishes.     One final note, I understand your chefs at the bar is famous. They were to busy talking to the familiar customers. No one cared to say hello to us \"the new customers\".  They were loud and your place lack ambiance. You need to deem the lights a little bit and ask your chefs not to be so loud.   In comparing your dishes to Seoul Korea, we should have gone back to this restaurant.  Although it simple inside, it is never disappointing.       I am writing to you instead of publishing these comments in FB or Yelp. I think you deserve another chance to hopefully use this email as a way to make it better.  Otherwise, you will slowly lose patrons to Seoul Korea Kitchen and  Pad Thai.      Good luck."}
{"text":"The food is good with big portion compared to the money paid for it. However, the service quality is not that great. When I bought take away or ask for delivering for lunch combination, frequently there were missing things in the portion (ex: fork  & spoon missing, no soup). I am just curious how can this place still in business with its terrible service."}
{"text":"Best Sesame Chicken, been their a few times before and after school. Good customer service. never had a problem with the food. It's cheap but offers a ton. It's something you won't get tired of."}
{"text":"Still love the Golden Dragon! We go there a few times a month and it is always good. Some of our favorites include the hot and sour soup, orange chicken, spicy shrimp, Szechuan chicken, and honey walnut shrimp. Their lunch specials are some of the best in town. About 6 bucks gets you an entree, hot soup, a spring roll, fried rice, and a crab rangoon. Always hot fresh, and delicious. Plus, the owners are really nice and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"After attending a meeting tonight nine of us went to the Golden Dragon for dinner. They serve  \"American Chinese food\". Everyone got something different and everyone agreed the food here was outstanding.   Here is my take on this place....I always start my meal with the soup. If the soup is  is good usually the food is good as well. Tonight was no exception. The Wor Wonton soup was excellent!   In addition to my soup I got a vegetable dish. The sauce on it was superb.   Everyone commented how their entrée had good flavors, was served hot and the ingredients used seemed fresh. No one was disappointed with what they got.     prepared perfectly. The food here is great and while it isn't 100% authentic it's very filling, not expensive, had large portions, was served fast and every dish was delicious. I can't emphasize enough how inexpensive it is!    ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldn't mind going again if a friend or family member wanted to go.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DON'T WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISHMENT!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place been coming here for 10 plus years.  Staff nice and prices very reasonable.  Give them A try, don't know what's up with some of these reviews..."}
{"text":"Nice decor! The egg rolls are fantastic! Best I have had in a long time! The veggie fried rice was so flavorful I didn't even need to use soy sauce. It even had fresh mushroom and bean sprouts. It was the sticky rice kind- a lot of substance.Egg drop soup was flavorful. My friend loved the cashew chicken  and I had the eggplant with garlic sauce. Wonderful -with plenty of vegetables!"}
{"text":"Went last night with four adults and two kids.  Food is very good for roughly $10 per dish.  Shrimp dishes very good value.  Our family liked the shrimp and chicken dishes but didn't like the spicy beef dish which was a bit bland.  It's an old building and the interior is very plain, but you go here for the good food at very reasonable prices.  We'll also use the take out option now we've sampled some dishes."}
{"text":"Wow this was a great place. Hidden gem if you are in this area. Service is excellent!!"}
{"text":"The ONLY place I go to for Egg Drop Soup!!! Literally amazing and their spring are so fab! They have take out so that's usually what I do when I'm feeling under the weather!"}
{"text":"Family run place. As soon as you walk in you are welcomed and asked how are you and if you are ready to eat. Warm atmosphere and huge fish pond. Chinese and Japanese food and sushi is on point!!! I got the miso soup and teriyaki chicken, it was a huge plate and had leftovers. I will be coming back for sure. Ohh and they have a huge party room as well!!! $-$$$"}
{"text":"Twice cooked chicken is the best!! Only Chinese place that offers it."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!! Worst customer service I have ever received. Pick any other Chinese place! Our waitress didn't greet us for about 15 minutes. When she finally approached our table (I wouldn't call it a greeting) she sat two waters on the table and walked away. My Mom tried to order a Diet Pepsi but the waitress shouted at her to hold on. I resisted the impulse to leave at that moment, big mistake. It took her 15 more minutes to get us each a Diet Pepsi. Next she brought us the wrong soup and insisted we ordered it. My entree was terrible, my Mom's entree was good, and our Crab Rangoon's (appetizer) came after the meal?! Our waitress also sat in the booth across from us and ate her lunch. That's appetizing. The wait staff also shouted at each other in Chinese for most of the meal. I typically love Chinese food and have never had an experience like that. I felt it was my duty to write this review so that others don't waste there hard earned cash here. This place does not care about the customer at all and the food I tried was a 3 out of 10 at best. ICK!"}
{"text":"Ok so I normally go elsewhere in town, but today they didn't answer the phone so I went with plan B. I have heard good things about Golden Dragon but have never gone here until now. I ordered three entrées to go. I ordered sesame chicken, general tso's chicken and sweet-and-sour chicken. The sesame chicken was different than I'm used to but had a pleasant crunch and sweet taste. I would definitely get it again. The sweet-and-sour chicken was also good, however the sauce was a bit thick and there wasn't enough of it. I got it to go and it was in a little cup. The general tso's chicken(which is normally my favorite) was basically sweet-and-sour chicken with spicy red sauce on it and a little bit of broccoli. Although good overall, I'm not sure I would do this again. I would have gone more than four stars but price was an issue for me. For three entrées and two eggrolls it was over $32."}
{"text":"Golden Dragon is another place that I always go whenever I am home in Akron. Their old location was awesome- they were a little further down the street, right by my old ballet studio. That location was divided into two sides- Japanese and Chinese. On the Japanese side you could sit on the floor, which of course my family always opted to do. The new location isn't as fun, but they have the same people working there and it's always nice to see a familiar face.  The food is pretty standard American Chinese food. The sushi is pretty good for Akron :) and they have a pretty good lunch buffet on the weekends. It's a family favorite, and was always a place that we went when I was growing up. The service is friendly and good, the food is consistently tasty, and even without the on-the-floor seating, the ambiance is very nice."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the House Special Chicken and I ordered the Walnut Shrimp. We were blown away by the quality of how both entrees were prepared. The chicken was moist and flavorful but not overly seasoned. The shrimp were large, also moist in a tasty honey sauce. We just relocated from Seattle area, ordered on Mother's Day for delivery. It was delivered very fast and the price was just right. We will absolutely be ordering again from this place!!"}
{"text":"It's ok but nothing amazing. Food is bland and tasteless but they do deliver and take about an hour."}
{"text":"Been coming to this restaurant for well over ten years. While my favorite thing about it is the fact that it is never to busy and you generally never have to wait, the food is pretty decent also. When my family was just my wife and I, this was a fantastic place to randomly hit to fill the need for Chinese food while also being able to sit inside and relax while you eat. When my daughter came along, the staff proved extremely nice and welcoming to the little one. We came to really appreciate the service and kindness they showed from then on. Now it is my five year old's favorite place to go for after church lunch. Now, regarding the food, they have a large menu to choose from and if you are picky, it may not be the best for you. But to me and my family, we know what we like and we are most usually very happy with our meal. I often get something different and have been known to pick something at random and be less than thrilled because it was not my taste, but never because of their cooking.  If you like something different and spicy, I recommend the Sun Devil Chicken, while the spice can vary from 'hey that's a little spicy' to 'why did I order this!?' spicy, it is often my favorite."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. I've only done take out, but the service we did get was good. Their black bean beef was excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for at least 6 years. Lunch specials are huge and they will make lunch special out of anything on the menu. Sun devil chicken , honey garlic chicken and twice cooked chicken are all very good. We often eat in  and food comes promptly. The servers are attentive. The only thing I don't like are the egg rolls...which have a spice I don't like. If u get the curry I would ask for extra spicy. I get most dishes extra spicy...also they are awesome about customizing dishes with veggies u like. Lunch specials are under five bucks and about 2 meals worth of food. Would give 3.5 stars but iPod app won't allow."}
{"text":"During the Chinese New Year lion dance we had several frustrations Our reservations which were confirmed several times including an actual trip to the restaurant to pick a table, was not honored. The servers needed to take a short break from serving during the actual show. It was ridiculous to have the show blocked during this time. The whole point of the show is to be able to see it,and the food should be served prior to the show which by the way was thirty minutes later than scheduled.  So basically if they honored reservations, served food prior to show and moved a table out of way so all could see, the food was good and the show was very entertaining( if you could see over all the heads of people they packed in)"}
{"text":"This place is smack your mamma good! I went and got take out with my main man Dan and the food was out of world! In fact it was so good the night we had I went back and got their ridiculous lunch special for a cool $4.95 ( I would have paid $10) I'd give six stars if I could. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Do not order egg fo yung unless your into water chestnuts and bean sprouts they really need to taste there own food and ask themselves if they would ever return. Not the worst though the shrimp and broccoli was fresh and tasty. Fried rice was probably old a day or so. They won't survive with this food. They should do a do over cause there's plenty of competition on mayfield"}
{"text":"Been here several times and the food is always good, lunch always cheap and service always friendly."}
{"text":"Just Meh. Ordering was easy. the menu was extensive. Delivery was fast, convenient and easy. Delivery time was good. Prices weren't that bad. The food wasn't anything to write home about. It was just your run of the mill Chinese take out. We have been searching all over phoenix for some blow your mind Chinese take out. Bummer. Was hoping this was it."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout egg fu yung. I'm used to egg fu having the texture of the various contents. They must have put the contents in a blender because it was like eating fried paste. Still looking for a good chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and large portion sizes. Great for splitting with people. The service is at a decent pace. l and the staff are friendly. Their wontons are delicious! I've tried both dine in and to go and it didn't take that long to be ready for either option."}
{"text":"I have gotten take-out from here about once a month for the past three years. I normally get the chk broccoli and my husband gets the kung pow chk or the happy family delight. It is not the greatest Chinese food in the world but I like it and they give you a good portion size for the price. Try it out... if you don't like it you only wasted about $7."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.. Chai not only charged us for two items that he completely forgot to serve us but he also charged us for a roll that he screwed up. His excuse was that right before he threw the food away my friend said she would eat it. So he charged us for the new,  right order AND the one that was headed for the trash.. I brought it up to him and he refused to take it off the bill!! That has never happened to me at any other restaurant I've ever been to. Unreal."}
{"text":"Very friendly family restaurant. The egg foo young was some of the best I have had in years. 2 bus loads of people showed up ahead of me and my meal was served quicker than expected. Would go again I'd I lived here."}
{"text":"this is my first time being here so 3 stars.. Food was quick, not sure if i like that or not... most places ive been to i usually wait about 5-8 mins... but i will try it again... Portions are about what i expected for a lunch special"}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner after reading the reviews. Not what I am looking for as far as Chinese food is concerned for my taste.  Portions were decent but lacked taste.  Will not return as there are better places out there for me."}
{"text":"Crab puffs are decent. Everything else was either bland/flavorless or just kind of gross. Won't repeat."}
{"text":"Went during the week.  Service was slow considering the number of patrons.  Food was ok, but not great.  Hot & Sour soup was good.  Egg roll was overcooked and dry. Princess pork was okay. I like spicy food and these dishes had good spice.  Unfortunately not a lot of other flavor behind the heat.  Prices were too high for the quantity/quality.  I still may go back to try the sushi...I see a lot of good reviews."}
{"text":"I've never had better Sesame Chicken. I put in a to-go order on my way into town whenever I visit my parents."}
{"text":"We went last night, first time in a number of years. This is an old place -- I am pretty sure it was around when I was in high school and I am not a youngster. I've eaten here any number of times over the past 30+ years. It is in new hands or some change in management. Quality has really dropped. Prices have literally doubled, vs other local Chinese places -- they now charge $13 (!!!) for a combination plate with egg foo yong -- literally the cheapest dish on any Chinese menu! I could get a shrimp entree for less than that at most other local Chinese eateries. And it doesn't even come with won ton soup (!!!) -- also a very inexpensive item or hot & sour soup -- those are extra! (50 cents for won ton, 75 cents for hot & sour ) -- I have never seen surcharges like this elsewhere, nor did this place used to charge this way.  They may have lunch specials, I don't know -- it was not in the menu nor on their website. Regular dinner prices for all items were roughly 30-40% MORE than most other local Chinese places -- for example, $3 for a cup of won ton soup which is $1.50-$1.75 elsewhere. I see no reason in location (old place in old strip mall on Mayfield) nor ambiance (clean but old fashioned) for these huge price increases.  It used to be that the Ho Wah at LaPlace in Beachwood had the highest prices I'd ever seen locally for ordinary Chinese food -- but there, you could argue the location and interior of the restaurant were \"fancy\" and upscale. You cannot say that at the Golden Dragon.  We had a Groupon and had to go back 3 times (!!!) because they would not honor it on Christmas Eve or December 27th (a Wednesday!) because of \"holidays\". Well, Xmas Eve is NOT a legal holiday nor is Dec 27th. They are nothing. This was not fair.  We had the family dinner for 2. I will be fair and say the soup was very good (big bowl of wonton for 2, plenty for 3 servings) and the appetizers (egg roll, shrimp puff and spareribs) were outstanding, among the best I've had. But the entrees were a huge disappointment. We had kung pao shrimp and chicken subgum chowmein -- two standard choices. The chicken in the subgum chowmein was gross -- it was tough, chewy and tasted \"off\". The kung pao was very stingy on shrimp. Both dishes were marred by being overwhelmed with huge amounts of chopped water chestnuts, clearly to \"pad them out\" to fill a big plate. BOTH dishes. The actual ingredients were skimpy! The chow mein was especially poor, and this is a pretty simple dish. It had almost no sauce, was flavorless and dry. I'd NEVER order it again. The kung pao was mediocre at best.  Dessert was supposed to be a choice of almond cookie or sherbet -- but all they had was vanilla ice cream. It was OK. We would have preferred cookies. (I think dessert is mostly unnecessary with a Chinese dinner.)  Like other posters, I want very much to support small family-run businesses. The area has several very good such places which we go to regularly. Also, I think Golden Dragon has suffered in recent years from competition at the TJ Buffet across the street -- which offers an all-you-can eat lunch for $5.50. The quality is not great, but it is sure cheap. However, I would pay for quality food -- just not 40% more than other family Chinese eateries. The price is wildly out of line with the quality here. Too bad."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very quick and fast service! They never disappoint. For sure the best Chinese food on that part of Glendale!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and the setting!  The food isn't at all good    None the less we enjoyed being there :)  Loved the design inside"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it got here really fast. Within 15-20 minutes.  Got the pork fried rice and it was pretty good. Generous portions and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I moved to Los Angeles, yet Golden Dragon is still my favorite sushi place! Every time I'm anywhere within 3 hours of Golden Dragon, I make a point to visit.  Their sushi is top notch, as are their other dishes. Chai, Hong, and Meng love joking around with their guests, especially when you sit at the sushi bar! It doesn't take long for them to treat you like family, which then leads to them offering you food not on the menu.  I keep trying, but have yet to find a sushi place as fun and delicious as Golden Dragon!"}
{"text":"The Teriyaki chicken was good. The Shrimp Lo Mein was over cooked. The crab puff we not over cooked but really dry. The ribs were ok.   I received the order in a plastic bag and the entire bag was covered inside in the sauce that the Shrimp Lo Mein came in.   I might eat here again as soon as my memory fades. I am a little disappointed as I am not very picky."}
{"text":"A friend brought me here while I was visiting her for a long weekend.  I love sushi so I was really excited since I had been craving it for a couple of weeks and hadn't gotten around to going out for it at home.    First, we ordered edamame which were cooked perfectly and I appreciate that they didn't salt them so we could salt them to our preference.  The house salad was a nice size and I enjoyed their ginger dressing, although it was different from other ginger dressings I have had.  We then ordered several different rolls including the Smart Alex roll, To Die For roll, and the Hot Rod Roll.  The Hot Rod Roll was my favorite by far.  One thing I found disappointing was how many of their more interesting rolls had cream cheese in them.  Truthfully, I am a purist and don't feel that cream cheese belongs in sushi.  I also tried a couple bites of their octopus salad which was absolutely excellent and I would definitely order in the future.    We sat at the sushi bar and had great service from Chai, the sushi chef.  Overall, it was a really great and fun atmosphere where we made new friends and had a few interesting (in a good way) moments.  While the sushi could have been better, I had a great time and would easily return."}
{"text":"So first thing I want to mention, is that I was shopping around on a delivery app for Chinese ( i get a craving for it about twice a year), but the prices were outrageous everywhere I looked and the ratings were not promising. I logged onto my Yelp to find a place near me for pick up and spotted Golden Dragon. They don't have all their stars, but when I called to order the lady was friendly, helpful, and helped me figure out what I wanted for a family of 5. She even talked me down from ordering more food because she said my entrees would come with quite a bit of rice. Integrity. I hang up, to straighten up the house and next thing I know the delivery guy is here! Fastest delivery i ever got, not even pizza comes that fast. The food was delicious. The portions were large. I ordered 2 entrees and a side of Noodles and there is enough for left over dinner a 2nd time! I am not an expert on Chinese food, but I do eat it... and normally only twice a year because I feel like its all made from plastic when Im eating it.... this Chinese Food however was awesome. Best I've had by far! Definitely will keep this place as a regular to order from."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout on Christmas. Egg foo young was awesome! Not too salty and made fresh. Veggie soup was great, large pieces of veggies and great flavor. I waited in the lounge and watched the cavs game, food came out in 15 min which was good given how busy it was. This place is old school and nostalgic. Love it."}
{"text":"Friendliest staff you will ever find!  If they don't have a nickname for you, they will remember your name.  This place is the Chinese Cheers!  You will feel very welcomed.  The owner and staff will all engage in conversation with you and they are all either very polite or funny or both!  The interior is very nice.  It is spacious and clean.    Everything I have ever had here is wonderful.  We have tried half dozen different sushis, Japanese & Chinese dishes. Their tempura is amazing, so is their bubble tea.  I just can't say enough about my friends at Golden Dragon!  The only thing I would change is to make the sushi bar bigger!  Everyone wants to sit around the bar, mingle with the staff & other diners and hear jokes!  Great entertainment!    Tell them Kim Possible sent you!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with a friend for the 1st time.  Very clean and the food was delicious.  I had the shrimp in lobster sauce and my friend had the pineapple chicken. We both had the lunch special which is beyond reasonably priced.  I will definitely go back again.  So far the best I have had in Glendale."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and a great value when selecting a combo. We'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here, craving sushi. We both ordered a side of fried rice, soup, and some rolls. The hot and sour soup was very good. However, the sushi was not fresh whatsoever. It smelled fishy the moment it hit the table and it wasn't even rolled completely (rice falling out). We both had to send ours back. The waitress was completely rude and almost judgmental, as if we had no idea what we were talking about. We will not be returning by any means. The place was completely empty, and now we know why."}
{"text":"Good American Chinese food. Good portions. Service is not bad. Try the hofun. One of the best General TSO's Chicken, you can actually tell that is white meat chicken breast. The hot and sour soup is good, That is one of my standards for Chinese places. The mu-shu is very good. Egg rolls are the bomb, so is the American wonton soup. Very consistent place. So with Chinese places you got to know what is good on the menu. They will customize your food for you as well. Dishes tend to be about 10 to 15 dollars."}
{"text":"Amazing food and unbelievable prices. I was able to get an entire entree and make it a combo (soup, egg roll, wonton) for only .55 cents more. Super sweet staff also and very quick. I wish they delivered in my area (that is the only downfall) but otherwise, I will definitely be ordering in the future :)"}
{"text":"I always have them deliver, it's quick and convenient. I love their Mongolian beef, I always ask for extra spicy. Good chinese and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"After having having driven past this place for years, my wife and I finally decided to stop in and give it a shot as we have tried just about every Chinese restaurant around Akron.  We had the chicken with broccoli and pork chow mein.  Average portion sizes but both the entrees and the fried rice were pretty bland.  It's hard to find really good fried rice but Golden Dragon's was like white rice with a slight bit more flavor.  The man at the front counter was very friendly as was our waittress.  The decor is pretty nice and the service was good.  They have a better than average drink and food selection.  They actually give you both Japanese and Chinese food menus.  I'll stick with House of Hunan on Exchange St. downtown."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving Chinese and looked online for a local spot that was closer than our usual spot. Not only was it close but the food was great, the service was nice and helpful. The restaurant itself was very clean and the atmosphere was nice. The food was brought out to us fairly quickly and everything seemed to be fresh. I ordered the orange chicken plate and upgraded to egg fried rice and my husband ordered the Mongolian beef plate also with egg fried rice. Both plates included the usual spring rolls and soup. We had the egg drop soup which was great. Both of us were very happy with our meals And this will definitely be our new go to spot for Chinese."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's super quiet, nice staff, excellent food and very reasonable prices! Will definitely return again."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food for me, a very picky person and lots of food used to make my foods I don't like"}
{"text":"The best shrimp fried rice I've had since moving to Peoria in 2014!  Fast delivery, food was hot & fresh, not greasy, and my Pepsi wasn't watery from melted ice.  First time eating here & definately would order again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food and the service here, although my order was to go. I ordered vegetable lomein as well as Singapore noodles and vegetable fried rice. Also got some spring rolls. The spring rolls we're ok but everything else was not. The lomein noodles were not lomein noodles. They were this white noodles. The sauce was virtually non-existent and was not the typical brown sauce. It was not only not what I expected but it tasted terrible.   Singapore noodles are a great test for a Chinese restaurant. They failed. In the areas of the dish that were seasoned, it wasn't bad, unfortunately, there were only patches of seasoning with large areas of just plain noodles. As if to add insult, the shrimp seemed a bit off. Very fishy tasting. (interestingly others commented on the shrimp being fishy)  The vegetable fried rice was literally gray in color. Very unappetizing appearance. It had a taste to match.   I did call the restaurant to hive them the opportunity to make at least the lomein right, I was told, \"that is the way we do it.\" They won't have the opportunity to do it for me again.  Save yourself from a dissapointing expereince and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ok this is our new favorite Chinese restraunt... fresh, hot and tons. Of flavor!!  We had the sweet and sour combo, which comes with shrimp,pork and chicken. And potstickers. And house chicken with garlic sauce. All 5 stars"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since college and this is honestly one of my favorite local finds. The food is phenomenal, service incredible, and it's a lovely place to spend time in.   It's hard to find places in northern Phoenix that offer delivery for truly great food, and hike I myself am still more of a fan of walking in, it's an super convenient option for busy nights or surprise guests.   Definitely check this place out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Always good food here.  Friendly service. Polite staff and owners are there to greet you with a smile and will recognize a returning customer. They have been around for as long as I can remember and are worth a visit for their great food."}
{"text":"We went in the middle of the afternoon, and there were no other guests in this large restaurant besides my partner and I. We were seated at a booth but later choose to move because the overhead lightbulb (recessed) was blinking, causing discomfort on the eyes.   This restaurant has nice decor, complete with a pond and interesting pieces of Asian decoration pieces on display. (They have a small selection of gifts for sale.)  Our server was quite friendly and efficient. We ordered an appetizer of shrimp blanket which was a shrimp wrapped in a spring roll wrapper with a little cream cheese inside. This was quite tasty. We also had a regular Pho ($8.95), seafood Pho ($12.95) and Princess Pork. While the Pho was tasty, I was disappointed with the portion size. It was served with a plate of vegetables (Thai basil, bean sprouts, and lime) but no other condiments. I had to request some hot chilli oil to spice things up. Also unfortunate was that the broth in the Pho was not beef based. Honestly, I did expect more (food) for the price of the dishes. I have no complaints about the pork dish, though. I would order the Princess pork again but would have to be pretty desperate for some noodle soup to order the Pho again."}
{"text":"Little messy server was amazing, but the food is (in Mel b voice) \"off the chain\". Im picky with Chinese food because there are so many places to choice, but this place went beyond just \"good\".  LGBT friendly.  Nom nom"}
{"text":"sub par Chinese. you may be better off going to Panda Express. I maybe could have concocted better Chinese with house hold spices and a fry pan."}
{"text":"This place has recently been remodeled and I'm not sure if it's been taken over by someone else or what. So unfortunate it's so gross now. Rude employees orders come wrong. I would really suggest checking orders before you leave. Also the 10 15 minute wait time is total bull be prepared to wait another half hour once you get there. Chicken should never ever be as chewy as there sweet n sour chicken was. I wish I would have known all the food changed before I ordered. Will never be back and dont recommend to amyone"}
{"text":"Overall: WARNING, UNETHICAL MANAGEMENT.  They do not honor paid Living Social vouchers.  Customer Service: 1 star.  The waitress was fine.  The 1 star is for the inept management.  I purchased a LivingSocial promotion of pay $20, get $30.  The promotional value expired, but the paid value doesn't expire for 5 years.  I notified the man at the counter and the waitress, and they had no issue.  As I went to pay, the man at the counter called a lady (I'm assuming the owner) to tell her about the voucher.  After 5 minutes of him arguing with her, he put me on the phone to talk to the lady.  She said that the voucher was expired and that I could not use any of it.  The voucher clearly states the paid value doesn't expire until 2019.  Again, she was on the phone arguing with me, which is crazy.  Finally they gave me the $20 off, but acted like they were doing me a favor.  Pricing: 2 stars: The sesame chicken entree was $13.95, which is the most I've ever paid.    Food: 4 stars.  The sesame chicken was good.  Beef teriyaki sticks were excellent; best I've ever had.   They have a good selection of meals.  Appearance: 2 stars.  It's a poorly decorated restaurant."}
{"text":"Ok. Let's just be serious for a moment. When you're home, and it's too hot to cook and you've worked all day...what about this crab puff craving you have? You call this place, like right now. It's so delicious for a empty not-so-busy place. Everything is so good, and delivery is ridiculous fast. You can easily find the menu online, sort of like all the other places out there, but their food is hot and delicious. If you ask for sauce on the side, everything is crunchy and amazing. Do it, and get the crab puffs. You know you want to!"}
{"text":"If you want to maintain your dignity, you'll avoid this dump at all costs. Besides being overpriced, the food took AN HOUR to arrive to our table because our waitress decided that a table buying alcohol was more important. Meanwhile, our water glasses stayed empty and tables around us we're sat, ate and left while we waited. Waitress nowhere to be seen.   Once the food did arrive, it was the wrong order and the waitress accused us of eating the scallops which never came on the dish. Nice right? It also didn't come with rice which took 20 more minutes to arrive, you know, after we had finished eating. Oh and the kids meal I ordered for my two year old came in two waves, 45 minutes apart. Kids deal with that sort of thing so well!   To fix it? The restaurant offered half off the meal they accused us of removing food from. Yeah, right. I'd like my two hours back from being wasted at a lousy Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is the cats meow when it comes to Chinese Food. Scarce availability of great chinese food in Phoenix had me in trembles. Glad to know I finally found a place to calm my nerves and fill my belly."}
{"text":"Me and my family will never eat here again. We used to love this place, but our last experience was just that, our last! We were sitting down and just ordered our food when I see something crawling on the chair next to me. Yep! It was a cockroach. I was so grossed out that I couldn't even wait for the waitress. We just got up and left and have not been back since. GROSS! Do not go here!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant of all time, service is great, great atmosphere and great food and I'm surprised how inexpensive it is for such good quality"}
{"text":"4 of us went. Each had a different dish. No one was blown away. Over priced. Best thing was the fried rice."}
{"text":"Delivery was on time. Shrimp fried rice was good. General Tso chicken was good but prepared different. More like a sweet n sour chicken.  Wings were ok. Egg drop soup was the plainest Ive ever had"}
{"text":"Great for students. Only $5 student special if paying with cash. Amazing sesame chicken (it's pretty much the only thing I get)."}
{"text":"Not the greatest Chinese or Japanese you'll ever have but its decent.  It's definitely better than the cookie cutter chinese fast food places you see around.  The mixed drinks are really good.  Right now it's the best Chinese food in Cuyahoga Falls."}
{"text":"I've heard great many stories here but I've never had any reason to come out here as I have my other fave sushi places. I ended up here after checking out another restaurant and we wanted some sake so we stopped by.  We arrived and they just have a random cashier lady that doesn't seem to do anything. We asked for a table and the sushi chef sat us...when it came to ordering, what we wanted from the sushi bar wasn't available. What gives? How can it be that great...well, if you want rolls, like so many people do now, this must be the place. We weren't here for that though. We all ended up just ordering randomly and just drank sake.  When it came to cash out, or server dropped off our checks and NEVER came back. It must be normal here. Who knows but I'll never be back. The place was DEAD too. I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"I really want this place to succeed because it is an independent, local business located in an area desperate for good food. So I'll say: the interior looked cozy and clean and my take-out order arrived promptly.    Sadly, it felt like a rip-off.   $12 for a shrimp and vegetable noodle dish that contained cold, flavorless noodles (no seasoning or sauce at all) with a mere trace of vegetables and a handful of tiny shrimp.  Very sad. I'm surprised that they would cut corners in an neighborhood where local people live, work, and shop routinely.  Reputation is what pays the bills for restaurants. You can put in the effort and provide good food to win folks as loyal customers for the long haul, or you make an extra buck on the first sale but lose your customer base for good."}
{"text":"Great sushi & the best staff! Chai will treat you like he's known you for years. The sushi is super fresh & the pieces are huge!  They have great Chinese food as well, but if you're looking for a great sushi bar, look no further & visit Golden Dragon!!"}
{"text":"This place is quiet. Too quiet.   No seriously, the west valley feels like a ghost town on a Saturday afternoon. This place was nearly empty, and there was zero music. I stared awkwardly at the menu. Tons and TONS of options, but I went for the honey garlic chicken. Sounded interesting, I like mixing something sweet with a little spice.   I'm still not understanding how they can put this much garlic in a dish and it still be bland. Nothing popped out. No honey here...just garlic, and a hint of sugar. I tried the orange chicken, too. That was way, waaaaay better. I guess I'll avoid unique items.  Lots of beer options, and some plum wine for $3 a glass. Delicious. Your meal comes with a big pot of white rice, and supper was ready in no more than 10 minutes. We passed the time laughing at some old lady who was disappointed they didn't have the same menu items as Panda Express. LOL, this place is way better, with comparable prices and options.   I'd come back for lunch, you can easily make it in and out in a half hour. Solid."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a large group. It was about 1 in the afternoon so we got seated immediately.  Ummmm.... I don't have a whole lot to say about this place.  The prices were good on their lunch menu.  The staff was nice.  We got water and hot tea. We did wait longer for some things. Long like, maybe our waitress forgot lol. I gave it 3 stars because others seemed to have enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Golden Dragon for many years.  It is nearby, but somehow I seem to forget about it.   Recently, I ordered delivery service and was pleasantly surprised at the delivery speed.  Not \"freaky fast\" but it was fast and hot!  The food was average to just above average in taste, but I'm not expecting Mr. Chow's or anything.  I'm ordering again tonight, if that tells you anything.  I expect it will be fast and hot!"}
{"text":"Just ordered Shrimp fried rice, which I don't usually order.  Was in the mood for it.  Got back to the hotel and opened it up.  It has the smallest shrimps I have ever seen.  On top of that, there's no taste to it.  What a mistake.  Staff is friendly and price is reasonable though."}
{"text":"sushi rolls had too much rice and fell apart. Horrible service. The only thing entertaining is if your sitting at the sushi bar and listening to the cooks and host say inappropriate things. I get it that they're trying to be funny but I wasn't impressed!"}
{"text":"@ Jeffery, I think you critiqued the wrong place, the buffet is across the street, this is a sit down restaurant.  I have eaten here frequently, take out and eat in. The food has always been good if a little expensive. I always have leftovers though so guess you can consider that in the cost. Some of the wait staff is good, friendly, some not so good and not so friendly.  Same with the check out guy, not Mr. Hospitable for sure but unless there is a problem so what, I talk to him for 30 seconds.  I don't like that the take out menu items don't include the same thing as the eat in menu items( IE no soup included). But IMO, it's the best local ( to that area) Chinese food by far."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! The orange chicken & twice cooked chicken is fantastic! Comes out fast, fresh and hot!  Any dinner plate you can make it as a combination for .50 cents more.. You get soup, crab Rangoon, egg roll and fried rice. Worth the money! You will also have leftovers :)   The lunch specials are the best, super cheap and sooo much food!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Delicious food, HUGE servings and super friendly staff. It's our new favorite and the prices are crazy good. If you want good food, do yourself a favor and eat here."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've ever had here in Phoenix! Great customer service, super sweet and were on top of everything!!!! Will be coming again soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered carry out last week, and it was extremely disappointing. The two items I ordered, kung pao chicken and chicken lo mein were both bland, lacked chicken, and the chicken was obviously from a can (it tasted like rubber). In both dishes, there were more water chestnuts and sprouts than anything else. Also, I was given a quarter cup of steamed white rice to go with the dinner sized Kung pao chicken and I sadly found a hair in it. The food is over priced and very poor quality. Golden Dragon is not worth your time, energy, and money."}
{"text":"This place is pure crap. Right after Ho-lee-chow closed down, I thought this place would be similiar to all the great Chinese food they had at ho lee chow. I was so wrong.   First of all, I seen the lady microwaved my spring roll. Even though it was one with the combo, that was simply disgusting and disappointing. It took them half an hour to get one dinner combo ready. It looked like they was still figuring out the best way to serve their customers.   The food was less than okay, anywhere that reheats chinese food is doomed for disaster. If you were looking for a cheap eat, come here but if your standards are high, stay clear from this place."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Had the octopus salad and got a second order to go.  Had the Sushi hot roll and it was outstanding.   The proprietor, Chai, was a blast and he not only made the Sushi, but kept us entertained with jokes and banter.  If you are in the area give this place a try,  you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not from Ohio.  I'm here on business.  I stopped by and I enjoyed my meal.  The soup was delicious, the salad was tasty.  The fried wontons were very hardy.  The steak and mushrooms with rice were fantastic.  They were very friendly to me.  I had a great experience and I would recommend them!"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick lunch! Good egg rolls, staff is nice. My order is usually ready in 10 minutes or less."}
{"text":"I love the food from this place, they deliver late during the weekdays and always such friendly staff, promoting, food is ALWAYS satisfying, warm and delicious not to mention large portion size for reasonable price."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and I plan on going again to tonight to prove the deliciousness and the sweet and sour chicken was a party in yo mouth"}
{"text":"First time ordering here and wasn't that impressed with the chicken lo mein. Really didn't have much flavor."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place hundreds of times, without stopping.  Always planned on it, but kept putting it off. Finally did the other night.  I had the Mongolian beef combo, by S/O had pork foo yung.   The food was above average and tasty for a low price.  Good value and good portions.  Definitely a do again.  Service: the servers were nice, but our waitress must have been 14 years old, and kept referring to the hostess, which might have been her mom.  Cleanliness:  the tables were disorganized, vacant chairs not pushed in.  Some vacant tables were left dirty and not bussed.  Granted, we went at 7:45 PM, but doesn't look good.  Decor: the place could use a remodel, coat of paint, and new, more modern furniture.   Because of those,it gets a 3/5.    Bottom line: I definitely liked their food, but next time, I think we will do take out or delivery, and not dine in."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  We moved to the area 2 years ago and have tried just about every Chinese food restaurant in the area but this by far has been the best. We have dined, ordered for pick and delivery!, never disappointed!  Love the Cashew chicken and the Singapore rice noodles! Everything I've had so far is amazing and the friendly staff just keeps me coming back. Hope you enjoy it just as much as I do"}
{"text":"Well we just got take out tonight; some of us had been before and recommended it. I like to consider myself a bit of a Chinese food connoisseur, and I was thoroughly unimpressed. First, the take out took nearly an hour and the order wasn't 100% correct, but they did give us a bag of fortune cookies (could've given a discount, but okay whatever).   The food wasn't labeled at all, which made things pretty confusing. Both types of fried rice we got weren't fully cooked and the rice was pretty cheap. I have had much, much better. The won ton soup was better than expected, but the corn chowder was tragic. It is a repulsive, chunky, gelatinous yellow slop or sorts. The chow mein was at least 40% mushrooms and very runny, so it spilled everywhere in the box. The pot stickers were burned well and were way too dough-y. The soy sauce wasn't even real, and they didn't include cheap wooden chopsticks.   Not coming here again...ever. It's more expensive and much, much, much worse than what I get in Chinatown in Chicago. Everything was overpriced and unimpressive. Avoid this place at all costs; P.F. Chang's is a step up."}
{"text":"Service is Golden Dragon's paramount, the wait staff will make you feel like a part of their family with their polite, fast, and courteous service. If you come to Golden Dragon more than two times in a short period, they will remember you and act accordingly.   The food is a good mix of Chinese & Japanese, with a complete menu for each type. Good vegetarian options, although many are heavy on mushrooms. The interior decor and music is above average for Chinese or Japanese restaurants of this price level, and the dining area and tables are always clean and ready. There's a separate bar area for sushi, but you can order from the menu from anywhere in the restaurant.   Overall, Platinum Dragon is good food highlighted by great service."}
{"text":"First time here and I will be back for sure.. General tso chicken was great ... Nice dining space.. Wish I had heard about this place sooner!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese spot if you're in the area. I highly recommend starting with the wonton soup. Egg rolls are very average here. The Pepper Steak and especially the sauce in it is the bomb.com. Every time I am visiting the area I make sure I stop by for lunch. Great staff as well."}
{"text":"Eh. Deep fry anything and there's flavor. A little surprised they can't follow simple instructions."}
{"text":"In the neighborhood and had a bogo coupon for a dinner and thought about paying the $2 to upgrade for soup and egg roll  firmly told that could not since using coupon. I explained that these dinners are more than a combo and that adding  $2  the waitress pointed to coupon and said no u are using coupon.   We ordered hot tea with the meal  we were not going to pay an additional  $3 for won ton soup.  Food was served hot as well as the tea. Plenty of food and will have enough for another meal this coming week.    Fiance thought chicken kung-pao was not as spicy as thought it should have been."}
{"text":"For me the Golden Dragon was one of those places you drive by all the time for years, always thinking \"Man, I really need to try this place. There's always cars in the lot and they've been around forever!\" but inexplicably never do anything more than that.  Well, after approximately 19 years I finally gave the Golden Dragon a try and it was...a valley Chinese restaurant.  I've been on a mini-quest to find a suitable replacement for my former go-to neighborhood Chinese joint (the lamentable Pong Pong on West Bell Road) and so far, so-so.  Therefore I was really hoping that my quest would end with this long pondered destination. I mean, hey, they have sizzling rice soup! That immediately scores a point of favor, right? So here's the rundown   The wife and I ordered takeout: -Szechuan beef -Orange chicken -Egg drop soup -Spring rolls -Crab puffs -Vegetable fried rice  The beef itself was good, tender and not over done. The sauce was typical brown spicy-ish gravy. Not overtly oily but commonly greasy.  The chicken was of very good quality, the \"spicy\" orange sauce was prevalent but the taste was AWOL.    On a side note, why is that Chinese restaurants always denote the spicy dishes on the menu? In my experience, this merely means that a dried red pepper will be placed somewhere within the dish, rendering a few surrounding millimeters somewhat hotter than the rest.   Any-hoo - The egg drop soup was all egg flour. That's it, not even a sliver of scallion. Not bad, but barren.  The crab puffs were pretty good. Large, with a better than average filling that contained a fair portion of Krab.  The spring rolls were pretty terrible.  Oilier than canned sardines and filled with a bland mixture of rice noodles and something that resembled the stuff that oozes out of the cyborgs in the Alien film series. The highlight was the veggie fried rice.  Fluffy, savory, with generous amounts of fried egg and bean sprouts.  All and all...a valley Chinese restaurant. I think I might have to abandon my quest to replace my old favorite Chinese joint.  Maybe it's not so much that I can't find something suitable, maybe it's more that I just don't really like Chinese/American food anymore.   (Except for sizzling rice soup. Why didn't I get the sizzling rice soup? I haven't had the stuff in eons)"}
{"text":"They recently re-opened after remodeling and it is not the same. I ordered the same thing that I have ordered numerous times, general tsao chicken. It used to be large, juicy, breaded chicken breast. Now it is small pieces of chicken with no breading and fried until it is hard and dry.  Their fried rice used to be to die for. Fluffy rice that was full of vegetables and large hunks of pork. Now it is dry and flavorless.  My soup and egg roll were both cold.  I asked for ice tea and was told they didn't have any, but then served me hot tea. So I made my own. I guess making ice tea is too complicated for this new service team.  I tried to provide direct feedback but they did not want to hear about it.  Save yourself time and money and do not go there."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, the food is probably alright if they could, I don't know..maybe get their orders right!? But I wouldn't know. I haven't ordered there in months because they've messed up on my delivery order three times in the past, but my boyfriend insisted he wanted orange beef so I gave them one more try..I specifically asked for NOT SPICY..what do they give me? Food soaked in chile oil and red peppers..maybe it's the language barrier, or maybe they are just f*ing idiots?!"}
{"text":"This place is on the way home from work. I stop in for take out every once and a while.  Location:  It's located in a plaza in Newmarket, a small place that has changed Business often in the past. It's been this restaurant for about two years now, it might just stay!!  Parking situation: There plenty of free parking, it's a fairly big lot. That being said, it can be a bit busy in the lot because there's a pizza pizza, Tim Horton's and Vince's country market - (grocery store).  They are close to the Newmarket high school so they have a large number of very inexpensive student specials.    Food: It serves the type of Chinese food my Asian friends call Caucasian Chinese food. Chicken balls, chow mein, etc... I grew up eating that, so. Yay. Tasty, a bit greasy, all good.  Not quite hangover greasy so it's all good! Not the best but good enough.   I especially like the house fried rice and the honey garlic ribs. Yum!  Interior: The Restaurant is small, note, that it feels like  they save on money by not having air conditioning in the summer or heat in the winter. There's a few seats, but they do mostly take out and delivery. I don't think I have ever seen anyone sitting there eating.  Decor is nothing special, its been many different restaurants over the years and no one really some anything but slap a few menu and food posters up. No biggie, its a takeout place.   Staff: The staff that work there are really nice, the lady that runs the counter always smiles and is nice despite the temperature inside the building!!  Prices are pretty inexpensive, you get rather large portions for your money too. Check it out if you are in the mood for inexpensive, greasy, hangover Chinese food!!"}
{"text":"Been going to this place since I was a kid. I love it. The people that own it are always so nice and remember my family every time we go in. The food is why we keep coming back though. I always get egg drop soup, an egg roll, sesame chicken with white rice and extra sauce, and sweet tea, of course. I've never been disappointed by the quality of the food. The soup is amazing. I'd drink a thermos of that stuff everyday if I could. I'll keep going back as long as I can for sure."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials for 5 - 6 bucks. Willing to customize which I love when dieting. I ask for steamed chicken and veggies with no oil."}
{"text":"I love Chinese food but have found it hard to find good Chinese places. Until now. We went for lunch and I'd have to say the prices for the lunch special are amazing, the service was faster than I expected, and the atmosphere of the place was inviting. If I lived closer, it would be my go-to Chinese place all the time."}
{"text":"Storefront looks so authentically Chinese on the all American Mayfield strip. Easy parking right out on front. I got the general tso chicken, which was a decent sized portion, unfortunately way too salty for my liking though. Seemed like a voluminous menu, wouldn't mind coming back to try something else."}
{"text":"Each time we go back we enjoy it more.   The staff are really very sweet and attentive.  We were able to sub an item on the pupu tray and the sauce that came with the dumplings was about the best I have had here"}
