{"text":"Loved this place! Fun atmosphere, great bar area and happy hour specials. The food was amazing, unique and very fresh! The staff is also very friendly and happy! Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"Do not sit at the bar that is where the service sucks. We just watched the bartender eat from two customer's plates. Food is good and service is unless you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch.
OK, it's attached to East Towne Mall, which should have been a rather large red flag, but Breakfast Buddy and I had spied \"Blackened Walleye Bene\" online and had to try.
Blackened Walleye Bene :Corn cakes, tomato, blackened walleye, poached eggs, lemon-pepper hollandaise & breakfast potato.

-An English Muffin is not a corn cake

-Asking for eggs poached light is not asking for eggs fried Over Medium

-Putting on the sweet Maple Holly from the other dish instead of the Lemon Pepper Holly is not so great, or is Lemon Pepper supposed to taste sweet?

-Forgetting my bacon is not ok, and charging $3 for 3 pieces of Sysco's Thin Slice and calling it \"Cobb Smoked\" is straight up dishonest.

-A large pile of Sysco shredded browns 1/2 cooked and heavily cheesed is not \"breakfast potatoes\"

-A \"Bacon Bloody\" with some tiny 1/2 rounds of summer sausage instead of bacon is also dishonest (but it was the best part of the meal)

A sad day for breakfast lovers everywhere."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised! It's a nice looking place with softer 1970's music playing. Prices vary on the menu and serving size was fair. The Sunday morning bloody Mary flight with breakfast was good. They offered free popcorn and the staff was happy and helpful, Nelson was a great waitress!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here. The bar tender during the day time always has the best recommendations and it always honest about what's not the best item on the menu. Hos recommendations are always on point.  Last time I had the Rueben triple combo. A TON OF FOOD!  This time the chicken tacos and a side Caesar.  My day is set"}
{"text":"I went here for trivia night with a group of friends. The waiter was friendly, but inept. He didn't want to write down our order, but also couldn't memorize it... which resulted in having him taking our orders (6 or 7 if us) and running to the computer between each of us to type in the order. The food when it arrived was \"meh\"- not good not bad, just food that is definitely overpriced. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I went there tonight with two good friends.Food was good ,fries were good, but unfortunately it was not worth the price  we were charged. $20 for a turkey sandwich and soup with a soda seems way too much for Madison area pub.
The portions are very large. Service was excellent. I just can't see spending that much for a sandwich. I'd rather have smaller portions and a smaller price."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great  tunes! Definitely be back! Directions just need to clarify that this restaurant is in the East Towne Mall. (Between the Food Court sign and Buffalo Wild Wings!)"}
{"text":"The food is great! They have a large menu and the staff is really friendly. They're open for breakfast, too!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent bar and grill on the east side of Madison that isn't a chain.  Lulu's 13 fits the bill.  There are friendly staff, good food, great drinks, and TV's everywhere!  This restaurant is located directly off of the food court in the East Towne Mall.  I went with my husband and 5 year old daughter, and the visit started off great with my daughter picking out a toy from their toy bucket, which kept her busy until the food came.  The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive.  The kids menu was large, with each entree served with a bag of Oreos and your choice of sides.  The regular menu was varied and had some great choices.  My husband and I got burgers, and the only reason that this restaurant got 4 stars instead of 5 is that their patties were obviously pre-made.  The toppings were fantastic - I got a Mac n cheese burger that obviously had Mac n cheese on top, but they added Cheetos as well, which created some great texture.  My husband had a burger with BBQ sauce, cheddar, and bacon, and we both agreed the toppings were awesome while the burger lacked flavor.  I got the L13 tots with mine, which were amazing - essentially potato croquettes with cheese and bacon in the middle.  My husband got the largest onion rings I've ever seen, which had a great breading.  All in all, this place is a welcome addition to East Madison and we'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place last night when we were at the mall. First, I have to say that the service is excellent. Our server was very friendly and checked on us frequently throughout the night. They also let us make the most of happy hour right before 6 (which is 3-6 PM Monday through Friday and all day Sunday). We ordered the cheese curds and pot stickers ($2 off each during happy hour). My husband had a glass of wine (house wine $3.50) and two beers (can't remember the special for these). We also ordered a side of fries and I ordered the french onion soup. Finally, I had the creme brulee for dessert. I'd say all of the food was really good. I'd say the only downside is that the prices are a little expensive, but that would be my only complaint. The ambiance is great. I loved the lit lanterns and the brick walls. I would definitely recommend Lulu's 13 Pub. It is nice to have a restaurant in the area that isn't a chain."}
{"text":"Great new place on the east side. Excellent service. Food was fresh, hot and very good. My son loved the buffalo wings. I enjoyed the California wrap with sweet potato fries. My wife said the guacamole burger was delicious. 

Nice big place with lots of TVs will accommodate large groups for games. Decent sized bar with an average beer selection."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while doing some holiday shopping this past weekend. We were seated immediately and had our beverage orders taken - our waiter was very friendly. The bar was quite busy as they offer all day happy hour on Sundays. 

I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was just ok, super messy. The best part was probably the potato chips that came on the side.
My dining partner ordered the homemade pizza rolls and they were kind of disappointing, not very warm and overly filled with marinara sauce.

We likely won't be back since there are so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Went here at the end of Happy Hour. I was still able to get a couple of drinks in. They have really great prices on domestic beers and glasses of house wine during Happy Hour. Their food is a little expensive, but you can get a discount during Happy Hour on appetizers. Our server Peggy was really friendly and attentive. Food came out fresh and hot. They have great customer service. I left an item of clothing and they were able to find it and hold it for me. I will definitely come here again in the future."}
{"text":"Food was good, the portions matched the price and the service was excellent. I liked all of the TV's that were available to watch. It's a nice addition to the East Side. We were seated immediately at lunch time on Sunday. Our food came out quickly, we ordered walleye fingers and the soup of the day which was seafood chowder. Seafood chowder had a lot of meat! Walleye tastes fresh and the tarter sauce was homemade. I'll be returning to try more things out"}
{"text":"Newer place. It's attached to a mall but has late hours. Really attentive staff. I sat at the bar so I can't attest to table service but everything was great. Brought popcorn with my first drink. I had walleye fingers and a bunch of drinks and took a salad to go. If you're looking for a place that's got a good atmosphere and good food and well poured drinks, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here knowing I wanted the blackened walleye tacos.  They were a \"starter\" so I also got a cup of seafood chowder.  I was beyond impressed by not only the food but the server as well.  I'm picky about my chowder, I hate chewing on \"gritty\" clams.  The seafood chowder was so good and my walleye tacos were even better.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First visit to Lulu's 13 Pub was a good one, $5 - 22oz Margaritas and Fried Pickles were a great start.  She tried the Rachel which was over stacked with delicately smoked turkey and delicious.  I tried the Wings Special with two different sauces - both were excellent.  For desert we tried the Fried Ice Cream - yum, warm cinnamon and crusty fried shell - delicious.  Lulu's 13 is new to Madison and should be a welcome addition to the East side of town.  Stop by and enjoy, we did."}
{"text":"Good food.   Good service. It's nice atmosphere for a sports event. When they're busy it can take a while to get your food. We understand that, but one would think you would plan accordingly for busy days like major sporting events when you are a sports bar..."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place twice now both times food is lukewarm services so so place is pricey for the amount of food you get before you go I suggest just checking the menu for example a fish Fry on Friday night all it comes is all a cart you have to buy each item separately coleslaw baked potato Etc"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast stayed for an extra Bloody Mary!
Atmosphere was nice, can't wait to go back to sit at the bar for a game. All the staff were great, they all were smiling and said hi/bye. Our waiter was very attentive (Eugene) Free popcorn while you wait and kids get to pick a toy when they come in or leave-what a great idea! Hearty portions and prices are inline. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Our experience was just ok. I'd stop by again in case it was just a one off or just bad timing. We were seated quickly, server at our table quickly and took our our order promptly. We had some soups come out first but then it took some time for our meals to come out. I had the Hawaiian Chicken which tasted nice but was a mess to eat. Next time Ill try the buffalo chicken wrap.  Our server never checked on our drinks until we were out for sometime and ready to pay our bill. If a few things we w little better it would probably hit a 4."}
{"text":"Comfotable atmosphere but feels a bit too much like I am at your average Applebees.  Ate at bar - new staff REALLY eager to serve you.  Good craft beer mix, surprisingly a better variety than a lot of food places.  Had BLT.  Piled high, plenty of bacon - it was good.  Chips on the side were a plus. Unusually light and crispy - a bit different - but really liked them.  Plenty of bar seating.  Good for TV viewing.   Maybe grow into 4 star.  Its a good new spot just nothing real special based on first visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch a LuLu's 13 Pub at the mall recently. We were seated immediately and our server came over right away. I had a burger and it was fine, not great but ok. We asked the waiter about a menu item and we were surprised that he could not answer our question and did not seem inclined to go fetch an? answer. It is loud in there with music and people chatting. Not the place to go for a romantic night out. We will try going back again after it has been open longer. I would like to come back once it is warm because I'm pretty sure they have outside seating."}
{"text":"Service was decent but food was terrible. Reuben wasn't even toasted. A side salad was just a mound of iceberg lettuce. Drinks were ok. Overall not impressed and don't need to go back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since opening.  The service is spotty.  This last visit the server walked past our table 3 times without checking in and I ended up flagging her down to get a drink, she then dropped the drink off at a different table.  She did not ask how our food was until she brought our check.  The hostess has always been pleasant and seats/greets you quickly.

The food is decent.  Nothing about the meals I've had have really had me leaving feeling satisfied with the money I spent.  I forget that they do not cook their burgers true to cook.  I asked for mine medium and recieved rare which grosses me out but like I said before the server didn't stop to ask how our food was so my husband took home to heat up and eat later.  

The tables and floors looked clean on all visits.  Huge win!"}
{"text":"My first interaction with the place was the women's restroom. It sounds like a stupid thing to be impressed with, but I'll always have a soft spot for a place that doesn't make me pay for a tampon. 

Our waitress was mostly nice, if very inattentive. Her greeting to us was \"We don't have a freezer. All of our food is fresh. Our freezer is about the size of your table.\" Ok, but like, which is it? Is there not one or is there a small one? It's a silly thing to call out, but I promise it has some small importance later on. 

Originally I was going to give it a 4 star rating. I sat and had to flip flop between 2 and 3 after everything. 

So let's start with the positives. 

- The popcorn they bring to the table is fresh and not stale
- Their bathroom is clean and stocked better than it has a right to be
- They weren't playing Christmas music in December, and that's nothing short of amazing.
- The bar/dining area is really nice and relaxed, and doesn't feel over crowded. 

Here's the middle ground.

- The food was mediocre at best. It wasn't bad (mostly) but it wasn't exceptional either. My tuna melt was not properly described in the menu. I probably wouldn't have ordered it if I had known it was some kind of hybrid open faced sandwich. My husband got the jalapeno popper burger, and he was actually really let down. It didn't taste bad, but I guess it was missing a lot of the flavors he was looking for. My tater tots were actually really tasty, but I feel kind of cheated that I paid extra for a whole 3 tots. 

Here's the bad.

- Service was really bad y'all. I've had worse, but that's not really a thing you want to have to clarify. Our waitress didn't really care to come to our table much. We didn't get more popcorn, which was unfortunate. I asked for a side of mayonnaise, and it didn't come out until my husband had already finished his sandwich. He's not a fast eater, at all. She then took his plate from him, which still had some chips and his pickles, before he was gone. She ran off before he could stop her. So you know, rude. 

- The menu does not do a good job describing the food. At all. I posted pictures of the menu though so others could get a feel for it. I largely feel that the price is a bit much for what you get at the end. 

- About an hour and a half after we left, I started feeling pretty ill. I hadn't eaten anything else before, so I kind of have to assume it was my food. I'm willing to guess it's the mayo that had clearly been left under a heat lamp, waiting for our waitress to bring it out. 

All in all, I don't think we'll be returning. We don't make it out to the East side all that often, and there are better options for pub food out there."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got seated and a manager or lead finally came to the table and asked if we wanted drinks. About 5 min. We ordered, prime rib French dip and fishwich. Both were very good. I would totally recommend this place for the food. But not for the service. It was absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"Lulus is a great addition to the east side! The menu has many different options, the staff is so energetic and happy and they're always playing great music!
I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I was asked to Lulu's 13 by my brother's trivia team.  There was a championship going on and they needed an extra team mate.  It so happened to be Cinco de Mayo. that day.  I got a margarita that was on special.  I got the blended which was nice.

I ordered the quesadilla off the regular menu because I was not overly hungry.  The chicken was good.  It was well put together.  Only complaint was the guacamole.  It had very hard pieces of avocado in it.  It was a small part of the plate so I didn't complain about it.  I will hope it was just because they were busy that they didn't take better care of the guacamole.

Our server was good considering he must of had a lot of tables.  I would be willing to give Lulu's another try next time I'm over by East Towne Mall."}
{"text":"Checked out this new spot the other day with my family for my mom's birthday. None of us had been in yet, so we were all curious. 

Upon walking in, we were greeted right away and sat immediately. The set up of the restaurant is nice. Everything is brand new and shiny. The decor is nice as well. It had a nice ambiance about it. It wasn't terribly busy when we were there, so that was nice. The main dining room doesn't have any walls, or partial walls, so I think it would be fairly loud in here on a busy night. 

I ordered the Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich, with mac and cheese for the side. The mac and cheese was mediocre at best, but the sandwich was quite delicious. I personally would have liked thicker slices of pineapple, but it was tasty regardless. The chicken Parmesan sandwich was the special that night, and it was ordered at the table. The one eating it said it was some of the best Parmesan chicken they have ever had. The BF ordered the Prime Rib French Dip. It looked AMAZING. I want to try that next. The French fries were wonderful. Perfect crisp to them. I recommend those for your side for sure. 

We got a cookie/brownie thing for dessert at the end for us all to share. That thing, oh man. It was yummy!! 

I didn't catch our server's name, but she was just great! She had cute purple hair too. 

I really would like to stop back and try the breakfast menu - it looks fantastic!"}
