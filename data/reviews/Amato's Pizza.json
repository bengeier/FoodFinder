{"text":"They only take cash, the menu is limited, and as far as the pizza goes-- you'd be better off getting a frozen pizza from the grocery store and making it yourself.  I'm amazed that they've managed to stay in business this long."}
{"text":"Best pizza around, i make a drive from west view"}
{"text":"I agree with the other 1-star reviews. Worst pizza I have ever tried. 

It was so bland with almost no flavor. Honestly, you are better off finding a Little Ceasar's around you or, like another reviewer said, grab a frozen pizza instead of this place."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a long time. It's my
Mamas favorite pizza. The shop hasn't changed in all these years. Easy street parking outside (where 1 quarter gets you an hour of parking). Cash only. Very friendly staff. Love this place"}
{"text":"I enjoyed both the pizza and hoagies this pizza shop offers.  It's a small joint that over the years has stayed true to their roots (for good or bad).  Their pizza is very unique, as the crust is very light and cracker like.  Their hoagies are also good and served on Mancini's bread (which is a plus to anyone from Pittsburgh).  My opinion: This place is worth a visit to try a unique pizza served up the same way since 1954."}
{"text":"First off I'd like to say i've been working at a pizza shop for the past ten yrs. So i dont order pizza often but when i do it's from this place. It's very good and the prices are very reasonable. Definatly different from any other pizza shop in the area."}
{"text":"When ordering by phone they quoted the wrong price.  Found out on pick-up and they wouldn't honor the quote they gave.  Was approx. $10 more. Staff was extremely rude to the point of being near hostile.

Also, the pizza was fair at best and was in a square unlike a normal pizza."}
{"text":"Wow really? I thought i already reviewed this HORRID pizza shop, guess i forgot to save it. I live right down the street , so i gave this local pizza shop many chances.. Its so bad, makes you wander why the hell people come here... Must be some kind of blind loyalty... Or their customers never tried real pizza.. Its the cheapest ingredients ever... Gross over sauced , no cheese, cracker like cheap dough.. Overpriced garbage. I tried some sandwiches too!  They only thing they got going for them is that they use Mancini's bread... Inconsistent portions, soggy lettuce.. Just save your money and stay away... If i could give negative stars i would.."}
