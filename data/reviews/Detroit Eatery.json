{"text":"Really enjoy this place!  Always a suprise from the first time i had the souvlaki (the best in the neighborhood), to the wings i had the other night, i would put them up against anyones.  Nice guys, and not a chain - thank you for that!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place today on a random trip up the Danforth and I couldn't have been any more ecstatic about it. Grew up in Windsor and as a die hard Red Wings fan this place felt like a home away from home. Atmosphere reminded me exactly of a tavern you'd find in downtown Detroit with tons of Detroit memorabilia. The menu reflected the city of Detroit as well. They even had chicken on a stick! Portion to price ratio was also fantastic. Massive burgers! I will definitely come back here to watch some Wings games this season. Detroit vs Everybody!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come from Windsor and Detroit is our favourite city in America. So when we moved to the east end and saw this diner, we had to try it. 

This is my favourite breakfast place in the whole city. As I said, I come from Windsor and I appreciate a greasy spoon breakfast, and that's hard to come by in Toronto at times. I just want two eggs, over-easy, with bacon, homefries and white toast. And no one does that better than the Detroit Eatery. Their bacon is amazing. Perfect every time. 

I come here often. Love it."}
{"text":"I must say their food is good, I really enjoy the clubhouse sandwich. But I was there the other night and the young guy that served me went out front of the store to put some garbage out and when he came back in DID NOT wash his hands at all. Was very disgusted with the fact that he touched garbage and decided not to wash up afterwards and then serve customers. Probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"My trip to the Carrot Common is to Yoga..which builds a morning  appetite. I ventured to the Detroit Eatery on the Danforth Greek Town.  The snow was falling, but the inside was cozy....and was issued my own table, instead of the counter.
 I ordered  the twin eggs over easy , sausage, home fries and toast. Ice tea finished my order. 
The eatery reminded me of those small places you find on a remote highway when you get a flat tire, and your waiting for the Tow Truck.

 Service was quick and no loud music distracted my meal.  The Spartan d√©cor included wall hung Hockey memorabilia....not my passion.

The tables appeared clean, as my dinnerware. The meal came to $11.55 , an easy expenditure.  I would return."}
{"text":"Best burger in hogtown, & it's the reason I've been a regular for years. Not a first date kinda place, but a perfect joint to grab some grub with your buddies."}
{"text":"Been going to Detroit for over 30 yes, it's a place you bring your kids too as my father did with my  brother and I. Don't expect much, but that's what it is all about. Detroit offers in my opinion the best homemade banquet burger. By far, it beats alot of burgers out there, and I have tried many!. As well they have a great breakfast. 

If you're looking for a place to take the kids or a couple of friends for a couple of beers and some breakfast or burger, and as well a shrine to the Detroit red wings....this is the place....enjoy!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it's in my hood, it's locally owned, and it's a greasy spoon that I could see myself going to on a regular basis.

But I can't. Why? Because the burger was mediocre and it gave me the shits."}
{"text":"A good place for having a beer and a burger or a coffee and some pancakes in a good canadian diner. I've been there some times, when i was in Toronto because it was nearby and i really liked it."}
{"text":"Holy ! Normally I would never walk in to a place like this just because it looks . . . Ummm, a little shady from the outside. It is a tad shady but amazing bacon burger, top 5 ever for sure !!! Fries were fries, gravy was good. The spices in the meat with the maple  bacon was just awesome. 
I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"Experience -non talkative waitstaff

Food was good - but would have been nice to know that my order was going to cost $20.00.  Apparently there was a charge for absolutely everything

$20.00 for an omelet which I asked for without toast or potatoes - came with them anyways.  Thoroughly disappointing. Wanted to like it as I work close by...... but I am left feeling scammed."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot.. Right in the heart of greek town.. I go there almost every Sunday never been disappointed... Prices are fair.. But what I love the most is the atmosphere really feels like you're in an old school diner"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  Go here for the cheap beer and poor company if you must, but don't eat the food unless you want to be sick and feel ripped off.  It's a couple rungs below \"greasy diner food\"."}
{"text":"Yearning for the days that you could eat your breakfast with a side of tobacco smoke?  Yearn no more.  The proprietor (and/or some of his friends) stand on the sidewalk right outside the open doorway and smoke in between orders.  Ooops, is that the ready bell?  The server has figured out a way to come back in to serve the order while still allowing smoke to inundate the restaurant (see photo).

Anyway, my 2 eggs over easy, home fries and toast were fine, the coffee was substandard diner fare, and the chocolate milkshake (oy!) was not great.  It had a texturizer-y mouth feel.  Table-mates claimed the bacon was pretty good.

No need to rush back."}
{"text":"Old school diner, great food, staff, neighbourhood institution. Faves: sausages & home fries, corn beef sandwiches, chicken fingers, burgers!"}
{"text":"It was ok, I had the standard breakfast, nothing special, very ordinary. Coffee was passable. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but would go again with others if that was the choice. Soup is good and a real deal at $3.00 per bowl"}
{"text":"We've been eating here for 25 years. Weekend breakfasts often find lineups out the door. The regular menu is huge, and prices are amazing. We had the Detroit Burger and the Greek Burger, both perfectly cooked on toasted buns, served with coleslaw, for under $7 :) It is licensed. Great neighbourhood spot!"}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday breakfast. The server is really nice talks a good conversation with you to keep you occupied.

I love the vanilla milkshakes they have so much ice cream in it.
The pancakes are delicious.
My friend had bacon and eggs and home fries and it looked spectacular .  
And if your a regular like me you might get a lollipop from the gene Simmons candy bowl."}
{"text":"The Detroit Eatery continues to attain gastric recognition yearly. Winner of the prestigious Best Souvalaki 1999, the Best Homemade Burger 2000-2008, The Greatest Steak and Eggs 2007 and the Best Greek Omelette 2001-2006, the fare here continues to amaze even the most jaded burger aficionados.

I'm not making this up. I'm actually reading the back of the beautifully crafted Detroit Eatery vintage tee that I purchased this very afternoon. I will say it was an impulse buy, but stopping in at Detroit's was carefully carefully planned. From the moment you enter the veteran staff at this fine restaurant take car of your every need. Your table is watered promptly and as soon as you close the old school menu in front of you there is a server awaiting. The food arrives quickly and the burgers more than live up to their gargantuan hype. every bite is chalked full of greasy burger goodness and with a side of tangy slaw and crisp french fries this could be the finest hamburger combo in the city!!!"}
{"text":"Its a diner.  I got a good quick and greasy breakfast with two eggs, toast, bacon, potatoes and coffee for $7.50 - I've had cheaper but its okay. 

Coffee was watery and slightly burnt. 

The place is Detroit Red Wings and hockey themed if you're into that.  Mostly men in here. 

Not much else to say!"}
{"text":"It was alright, its a value vs quality thing. It's a home cook style burger but you get alot of meat for the price. I went with double Detroit, which included peameal bacon but it wasn't that good, nor were the onion rings or patty. It was just alot of mediocre food for a good price.

I guess I got try breakfast, Maybe that redeem this place

Pro: good price and value

Con: lack of favour and taste

Price is only thing saying it from a one star, I only stop here because it had good rating but that probably all from biased long term customer who haven't had a good burger in there life"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of my Airbnb host. Place looks like a dive, which is not a bad thing for a breakfast place. Had the 2 eggs with sausage for 7.50$. Very genius on the sausage and the potatoes were good.. Coffee is decent. Place is more Greektown than Detroit though. Service was efficient if a bit surly.. Probably because I'm not greek.. Lol"}
{"text":"I've said it before and I'll say it again, I love Zoodles, cheese-flavoured \"Party Mix\" (but not the pretzels) and things that you can eat where you can actually hear yourself getting fatter. 

So it's not surprise that I think Detroit Eatery is fantastic. It's a family-owned, Redwing-themed greasy spoon. It has an original diner counter complete with swivelling, red vinyl stools. They have milkshakes, french fries, coleslaw and burgers. 

If, as a woman, you dress up really nicely and show a bit of leg, you may even be able to harness your very own old Greek man entourage upon leaving. It's pretty flattering for us gals to know we can gorge on a burger, fries, coleslaw and gravy and still be uber-sexy to Stavros & Dom. Hearts! 

It's cheap, the food is probably mostly frozen stuff deep fried and that's ok by me!"}
{"text":"A bite from our full review - 
\"Detroit Eatery is one of those stalwart spots sticking to its roots and refusing to cave in to trends. Our experience was reminiscent of a visit to Avenue Diner sometime ago which we definitely enjoyed. \""}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I worked in the area about 8 years ago.  Its been a while and after all this time, it's still a great experience. nothing has seemed to change.
 The servers are nice, one guy in particular, younger looking is extremely courteous.  I came in with my boyfriend for breakfast, and this place hit the spot.  IT's got that hole in the wall kind of charm, I know that sounds strange but it is a strange and eclectic place, very \"guys-guys\" kind of restaurant.  Especially with all the detroit memorabilia everywhere.  Ive never been here during the night, but I would imagine that....it would be a good sports bar vibe for die hard sports fans.  A place to go with yu want to hang out with your buddies.  
 
As a woman, i'd like to see this place maybe renovate.  With that said, with keeping in the charm of its its theme.  I think the right person could still capture the ambience.  Anyway this place gets a 5 out of 5 in my books, because its exactly what you can expet from a diner of this caliber, its simple, straight forward but hits the spot, and the servers are super nice.  don't expect some poshy breakfast place...this is not the place for that but for what it is....a local diner with good prices, and a straight forward menu, its great."}
{"text":"Bias Review Alert!

As a life-long FAN of Detroit Red Wings, obviously this Diner/Dive has a special place in my heart.  Most of you would probably give good marks for something you're passionate about as well.  It's hard to disagree with something that you're emotionally attached to.  This is mine!

Awesome decor with Photos/Posters/Memorabilia.  Love the Dive feel of this place.  2 large LCD showing what else but a Sports Channel?  Service and owner do a fine job along with a no-nonsense Menu and has a Daily Specials as well.  You would think they would have items named after Red Wings players or something but this place isn't as pretentious as that.

While I enjoy Faygo brand Rootbeer(Detroit-made), I waited for my Burger($4.75).  It came out smelling pretty good which usually means the Patty has been seasoned and when I tasted it, the large Patty was seasoned nicely and had a bit of juice.  They even topped the Burger with Tomato & Onion as if they can read my mind what I like on it.  It came with some plain Slaw and a Pickle slice."}
{"text":"I love it all, absolutely everything!! I have never been disappointed at Detroit in about 13 years of going to this spot:))"}
{"text":"Slightly better than average food and shit service. The only reason we got our order placed and served to us in less than 20 minutes was because of the hungover yet diligent off-duty waiter that took care of us. Outside of him, it really seemed like none of the 'working' staff gave a shit. When it came time to pay the bill, all of a sudden the counter guys were attentive. I paid exact change and only tipped the hungover guy."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favourite meal to pay for and, since I've been hanging on the Danforth lately, decided to try the only diner I could find (there's a Wimpy's but was looking for an indie). Service was less than indifferent, atmosphere was diner with a side of hockey shrine, coffee was horrible and the breakfast was quick. Now, ordered the Hamburger Steak and eggs for the first time ever. In fact, I don't believe I've ever even seen it as an option on any brekkie menu I've seen. That, and a sign I saw advertising the Detroit Eatery as winner of some Best Hamburger award. 
I had images of a juicy grilled burger patty with onions, maybe some mushrooms and gravy but instead had a single fried patty, no toppings. Ah well, the home fries were good enough and, the best part of the visit, they had the Mark Harmon classic \"Summer School\" playing with volume on their 2 tvs. That alone will bring me back."}
{"text":"Pancakes and a chocolate milk. If I'm feeling adventurous it's the French toast. Really good!!! Love the atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"An old-school diner style restaurant that has many, many loyal patrons.  Great for a hangover breakfast or one of the lunch specials.  Great old-style, hot turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok...the place is a complete and utter dive.....but they have the BEST pancakes ever!!!!!  They are just like the ones grandma made.  The service is very \"U.S. North-Eastern\", which is strange for a boy from the South...but they are not unfriendly.  The prices are good too.  You can feed 2 really well for under $20...which is good in Toronto.  The only drawback to this place is that they only take cash."}
{"text":"Dive brunch bar!! Love it. 

There is something so oddly comforting about miscellaneous decorations and sticky counter tops that just lets you know that it does not matter that you haven't washed your hair in five days or that your breathe is still ridden with last nights tom-foolery. In fact, they have the grub that will cure whatever it is your liver is shouting at you and tell it to just 'shush, and go back to breaking down those tequila shots you so diligently consumed'... 

Astoundingly busy for being such a hole-in-the-wall. Looks like they've got a steady in-flow of regulars, so be prepared to wait. But it's a save when you are roaming the Danforth for breakfast and find yourself deviating away from Whimpys and Timmys... A PLUS."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast on the weekend. It has a casual atmosphere with a friendly staff, and pretty decent prices.

I went off menu w/ my order - a breakfast burger - something I had always wanted to try but never had the guts to order before. For the uninitiated, a breakfast burger is basically a bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg on top!

Needless to say, it was intense. But hey, anytime you can impress a bunch of hockey-loving Canadians with your order, you know you're doing something right!"}
{"text":"I am surprised to see such a high rating.  I had dinner here once and was completely underwhelmed.  The staff seemed like they could give a shit that we wanted some food.  The food itself was 100% lackluster.  The only thing good about this experience was they were playing Jack Russell Terrier races on the TV and that was entertaining.  

Never have gone back."}
{"text":"One of the best steak and eggs. Service is great, cozy environment. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Large amount of food for the price!"}
{"text":"The great news here is that everything is the same. Fantastic food at great value.

The guys have a new cash register but there's still no credit or debit cards.

Now has wifi is you ask real nice."}
{"text":"I'll have to come back for a second visit when this diner isn't teeming with screeching, unsupervised children and parents too exasperated to care, but for a first impression Detroit Eatery was pretty decent. I ordered the two egg breakfast (no meat) for $6 and my dining partner had the pancakes (described as \"excellent\"). 

The diner is no frills and decked out in Detroit Red Wings posters and jerseys. The staff is lifted straight out of Fargo Rock City and the uniform here is metal t-shirts like Metallica and Hypocrisy.

My breakfast was decent but not unforgettable. The home fries were basic boiled and fried potato discs, eggs over easy and plain white toast (not buttery enough). I didn't dare approach the tomato on my plate.

Cash only."}
