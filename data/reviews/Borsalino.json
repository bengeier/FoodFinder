{"text":"Just had a company outing here for about 20 people. They blocked off an area of the restaurant for us and really took care of us. Home-style warm decor and very attentive service. But the best part... The FOOD was incredible! Totally didn't expect this quality of food. I'm talking top notch 5 star ingredients prepared by a chef that knows what they're doing, seasoned and cooked to perfection. I don't live in the area but when back in Toronto and planning a corporate dinner, will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food was alright but the service was pretty bad. The server that was with us seemed really bitter and made my meal very uncomfortable. Don't really recommend this restaurant for summerlicious though."}
{"text":"Back again and again great food. The veal marsala  was perfect. If your looking for good down home Italian this a a gem in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Call me unsophisticated, but I like to be full when I go out to eat. And I was definitely full when I left Borsalino Summerlicious 2015. 

At $18 for lunch, it's not that far off from what you would probably pay if you ordered the items individually, but I was pleased with the value. The restaurant's interior is a little dated and looks like maybe an old Kelsey's with carpeted floors, so if you're looking for luxe, move right along.

APPETIZER: Greek Salad
--------------------------------------------------­---------------------
The appetizer choices were not very exciting. Aside from the very ordinary ceasar salad option, their soup of the day was beef noodle, which others said was a bit salty. However, the greek salad I ordered was nothing out of the ordinary in terms of preparation or ingredients, but it was delicious; the dressing to salad ratio was perfect.

MAIN: Borsalino Steak Sandwich on Ciabatta Bread
--------------------------------------------------­---------------------
6 oz open face steak sandwich topped with sautéed onions, peppers, Swiss & Cheddar cheese, served with french fries. The sandwich was delicious. They ask you how you want your steak, but because the meat is thinner than a regular steak, I'd err on the side of caution and order it rarer than you'd want it. We ordered three medium-rares and one medium, but when they brought the orders to our table, they didn't distinguish and they all looked about the same. The thick-cut fries were nothing special, but they were crispy. 

Others in my party ordered the spaghetti and meatballs (probably a little too ordinary to bother trying; I'd skip it), smoked salmon sandwich (a lot of smoked salmon; they enjoyed it), and the mixed greens teriyaki grilled chicken (weird option at an Italian restaurant, but enjoyable). 

DESSERT: Baklava
--------------------------------------------------­---------------------
A Greek favourite made of layers of filo pastry filled with nuts held together with syrup. I don't know if this is what baklavas are supposed to be like but it was super dense and quite sweet. I like sweet things, so I had no problem, but even I would say it was very sweet. 

The tiramisu looked not quite like the tiramisu I'm used to seeing, but the one bite I had was light and fluffy. Not bad. 

In general, I was pleased with food. The server was fine and quick to respond to requests. 

If you're looking for a decent Summerlicious lunch spot, I would recommend this. Everyone in my party enjoyed what they ordered and left with full bellies."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious and ordered off their special menu. It was a very filling three course meal. We got sat in the sports bar area but there was another side of the restaurant that was abit more fancy. 

I started off with meatballs as an appetizer and although it tasted good, it was abit cold. I understand that it was probably premade and just microwaved but they need to heat up their food more. Gotta at least give the 'this was just off the stove' impression!

Then I ordered fillet sole which came with a side of boiled veggies and potato. I was actually quite surprised with the portion of the fish! 3 huge pieces BUT... It was soggy... It was broiled fish but it had a soggy breading that didn't make it taste amazing. Again, food was warm.

Finally, for dessert, I had baklova and it was my first time trying it! VERY sweet and lots of honey/syrup - too sweet for me actually! It was drowning in this sugaryness. 

All in all, service was great, food is average and good enough to make you full."}
{"text":"I had the meatballs, lamb chops, and tiramisu from their summerlicious dinner menu.  Although I found the entree to be well prepared, the meatballs and tiramisu were nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This is actually a really cool place to catch a game with some buddies(or ladies). It's quiet, comfy and spacious. I'm actually here quite often to catch a game or 2 with my crew. The owners/servers are polite and the latenight bites are good for what it's worth. I would say this place is definitely a little cheaper than most other more popular bars but it's hardly a steal but then again my standards to consider something a steal is way more strict than most (Asian blood - ahaha).

The wings are always nice and crispy with good size and not too much sauce. They could be juicier but it's not like you're chewing on cowhide. There aren't many options for flavours but I usually stick with cajun or honey garlic but amp it up with hot sauce. Nachos, calamari, chicken fingers...etc are all pretty decent for bar standards. They also have a pretty good selection of the popular beers on tap (close to a dozen) and you're sure to find something you will like.

This place is old but very clean and spacious. There are lots of TVs hence why I say it's a great place to watch a game!"}
{"text":"Came here because my brother came and said it was pretty good. The decor of this place is completely outdated, which is no big deal. 
The waitress seemed to not understand us though. When two people out of our 8 people party had not arrived, she asked if we wanted to order drinks right now, and my friend said \"yeah\" and i nodded in agreement, she said \"ok i'll come back in a few minutes and let you guys decide\" and walked away. so.. there goes our first opportunity to order drinks.. then she returned and she asked again, and we said, 'yeah let's get some drinks,\" and again, i nodded and AGAIN she said \"i'll be back when the rest of your party arrives\". The six of us were really puzzled. 
Eventually when the whole party was present, we ordered our drinks and food at the same time, however she didn't punch in one of our orders and upon bringing everyone else's food and seeing his place was empty, she said \"dear, what did you order?\" and he told her, seafood pasta... she said \"it will be right out\". It took somewhere between 20-30 to come. We were contemplating if they were out fishing for the seafood and trying to make pasta from scratch or something. 
When we tried to pay, the waitress had left the bill and the debit machine, but didn't punch in her code, so we couldn't actually pay for the bill until we found her again - and when we did, the portable machine wasn't working, but again, couldn't resolve this because she had punched it in and disappeared again. The other waiter also had no idea how to rectify this and insisted on waiting for the original waitress to fix this issue.... we ended up settling it at the terminal directly plugged in at the end, but the missing waitress didn't help very much.  
All in all, the portions are BIG, like REALLY BIG, so you'll get your bang for buck here and leave full. But the service is iffy and the quality of food is mediocre. If it wasn't for the big portions, this place would not likely get any patrons. I wouldn't recommend this place, nor will i come back by choice."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with this restaurant. It has undergone a massive reno since the last set up and boy are the improvements easy to see.
The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating for our rather larger group of 20. They gave us a semi-private area to host a friend's birthday and even allowed us to come in earlier and decorate-plus points for that!

Food was acceptable with me opting for the rigatoni al verde. Nothing over the top.
Others were satisfied with their meals, so no bad reports either.
All in all a good experience here."}
{"text":"Such a good location I've been here numerous times had hearty delicious meals for 20 dollars I don't know what more to ask of a place"}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious and came in with low expectations (all winterlicious restaurants I've been too has always been kind of mediocre). Good thing too because the food was really mediocre. The meatball appetizer was definitely microwaved. The bowl was hot, the meatball was cold. The fish filet entree was OK with big portions. The dessert was definitely from Costco and they even botched that up! Im pretty sure they frozed the tiramisu and defrosted it before serving it to us. The tiramisu was soggy and stale tasting. 

The service itself was pretty good. The lady was friendly and checked up on us periodically. It's a pity the food wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I find the quality to be similar to Remezzo.

There was only one waiter during a slow weekday lunch and he was busy serving customers already. So I was greeted by another gentleman who I thought was another waiter but he introduced himself as the chef. He asked how I was and gave me a firm handshake. He gave us a lunch menu and also a dinner menu but he said it was okay to order from the dinner menu even though it was only 12:30pm. 

Service was great but it was a slow day with only about 3 other tables being served. The restaurant is also split into 2 sections - one for dinning and one for more of a bar atmosphere.  

Soup of the day was clam chowder $5.95 - not too bad (3 stars).

Mushroom risotto $14.95 - also pretty good. The dish had a rich creamy taste but it does get boring if just eating this dish by itself (3 stars).

Seafood Linguine $18.95 - this was the game changer. Super huge portions with more clams, oysters, squid and scallops than I could count. Also had 2 monster sized shrimps. Pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly (5 stars - extra point for portion and amount of seafood).

Meal came with bread and butter. 

Parking is available. 

Highly recommended. Give this place a try so they can get more business because they definitely deserve more customers than what I saw."}
{"text":"I came here because I thought that the food and price here were going to be similar to Remezzo.
They gave us complimentary garlic bread and it was pretty good! My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti meatball ($13.95) and I got the smoked salmon fettuccine ($15.95). The meatballs were done quite well and there was a generous portion of spaghetti. The smoked salmon fettuccine was very creamy and tasted fine. I really enjoyed the sauce and the fettuccine was cooked to al dente. For the price you pay, the quality and quantity here isn't bad. It took them a while for them to bring the food to us but the garlic bread tied us over.
Also, the waitress we had was very friendly and funny. This is a decent Italian restaurant in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"This was my first winterlicious 2015 and should have known better than to pick a place in Scarborough! 
I would like to rank this place slight better than airplane food and at par with food served probably at old folks home! 
Service was as u would find on Aur Canada flight! 
First off as soon as I walked in the door there was this moldy old smell! 
When asked what the soup of the day was the lady said chicken noodle! When asked what the \"Rice Balls (Arancino)\" on the menu was, her exact reply \"rice balls
Gee thanks Sherlock, that's what it says on the menu! When I asked if it was like Risotto rice, she flat out said no just rice in a ball! Thanks for the great description! 
It turns out it was this great crispy fried rice balls with meet and cheese inside! Glad I didn't listen to her \"great\" description! 
The meal came with warm toasty garlic bread! And then it went down hill after that!my friends grilled pork tenderloin was like a weird bad tasting veal scaloppini! My stuffed chicken was tolerable but the side veggies was overly steamed and fit to be eaten for those with dentures! 
The dessert was like hospital dessert! Overall very disappointing in regards to service and food! My friend had two bites and left the rest on her plate! The \"rice ball\" waitress noticed the plate and asked if we wanted to pack it up, when she said no thanks, she pushed further by asking \"u sure? There's a lot left!\" No shit Sherlock, u'd think she would ask what was wrong! Sigh wasted a good $25 on a disgustingly nasty dinner! Swiss chalet would have been better! Felt so bad for dragging my friend here"}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious because it was close to home. 

First and last time here. Rice balls are definitely frozen. Although the portions are generous. 

Service is slow. Server challenged my
Girlfriend as to why she didn't finish the food then apologized when she brought us the bill. 

Veal Marsala is 1 notch above food from an old age home. 

All in all. Would not return."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is fantastic and the service is great. The owners are always walking around and go out of their way to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Borsalino Dining Lounge is a welcome addition to this neighbourhood, especially if you want some alternative dining choice aside from Asian food.

This used to be Joey Bravo's and the new owner kept most of the decoration and have the same set up. Dining room area on the left and Bar area with big screen TVs showing sport event on the right.

Lunch Menu available so not a bad choice if you want to have a salad, burger, pasta or sandwich for lunch.

Meat Balls Sandwich on Ciabatta Bread with Side Greek Salad ($10.95) was quite good. With a big menu, I think it is a good place to come for lunch with a group.

There are some mainstream beers on draft plus Rolling Rock and Shock Top if you want to have a nightcap or drink. 

I probably be back for lunch again if I have cravings for some pasta..."}
