{"text":"I love this place. You'd never notice it from the street, but it's a hidden gem for all things lobster! I had the lobster bisque and the lobster roll around 2pm - the place was almost full! 

The bisque was tasty and full of lobster bits, but the vegetables were still too crunchy for my liking. The lobster roll was AMAZING. I know lobster at a restaurant isn't cheap, but I wish it wasn't $20 so I could come here every day to grab one of these! 

Awesome place."}
{"text":"Delicious cold lobster roll! Fresh, big chunks of lobster on a warm and tasty roll. Just yum. The d√©cor was cute too. They gave the bill in an emptied out lobster claw, lol. 

My only suggestion would be: if the chips that come with the cold lobster roll could be less oily, then the dish would be even more heavenly."}
{"text":"Out first day in Toronto and we had to come here per the previous reviews. Definitely make a reservation... 

The service and the people. Spectacular. Even when the place is full you feel like you're the only table.   They are very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly  

The food. To echo the others... Amazing. We tried the smoke board. It was so good. The lobster roll was the best. It was somewhat pricey, but the food was lovingly prepared and fresh. Worth every penny. 

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who likes good quality food in a laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very friendly and homey. I felt like I was at the owner's home, he even came out a few times to check on us and asked us how we liked our dishes. 

My favourite dish from brunch was the cup of the lobster bisque which came with toasted slices of bread. It's a non-diary dish that was full of flavour and fresh chunks of lobster.  For my entree, I had the herb omelet with scallops. I could taste the fresh herbs in the dish but I wished that they either half cooked the scallops first or at least let the scallop water drain from the omelet because it was sitting in scallop water as I was eating it. My table and I shared the cold lobster roll, it was okay. There was plenty of lobster on it so I'm not complaining but I added a bit of lemon juice because I felt like it needed a bit more flavour."}
{"text":"We made a lunchtime pit stop and I had the curried seafood chowder and he had the bisque. Both terrific! The chowder was loaded with whitefish, prawns, scallops and lobster chunks - along with potatoes and veg. Chased down with a cold glass of Viognier and it was perfect. Love the atmosphere - Mike (one of the owners) is so passionate about the place! They do different dinners on a few nights - we are so going back for the \"crackhouse platter\" and also to try everything else!"}
{"text":"WOW! ... You will want to come back again and again!  Definitely you have to do the Lobster Roll.  If you're up for it, the Mac&Cheese is also a great option.  Or do what we do and get both... then we share and share and dine till we're full. 

The staff are great and the food is awesome... we've regularly visited and have loved it every time.    That said... the portions aren't the largest; so those who are price sensitive may not enjoy it as much as those who are flavour fans!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday at 5:00 p.m. for an early dinner and for most of the time we were the only table in the place, although there was a very brisk take-out business going.

My wife loved the Lobster Bisque.  She thought the cup wouldn't be enough so she had the bowl and it was so big I had to help her finish it.  I had the Cesar Salad with a Lobster tail chopped up on top.  It was delicious.  The lobster was incredibly fresh and tasty. We should have just stopped there but also each had the cold Lobster Roll.  Really big chunks of fresh lobster that overflowed from the top of the roll.  My suggestion to the owners/chefs would be to actually dig out a chunk of the bread in the roll instead of just cutting it in half so that the lobster would fill the roll for each amazing bite instead of overflowing from it.

The Cameron's ale that we had it with (a brewery in Oakville) was very nice as well.
Smoked & Cracked try to use local ingredients and businesses whenever possible which is something I like to support.

We had a couple of small butter tarts to go and we had them on the Sunday.  They were gooey, sweet and the pastry was delicious unlike the cheap flaky ones from supermarket bakeries.

The total bill including tax and tip was just over $100, so it was a bargain for lobster this plentiful and fresh.

Just a note, that when we were leaving around 6:00 p.m., ALL of the tables in the place were now reserved for dinner for the rest of the night.

All in all, a great experience.  To say this place is now Toronto's best lobster restaurant is an under statement."}
{"text":"I will never have enough of this restaurant. The ambiance is casual and easy. The food is prepared with love. One special to keep your eye out for is the curry seafood soup, incredible."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the lobster roll was incredible. So why am I not giving this place 5 stars? To start with, $30 for a lobster roll is crazy.  The roll came with a single pickle and a salad. They give you so much salad it's as if they are trying to make up for the overpriced lobster roll.  I fully expect to pay more for lobster but who wants to go for lunch with a friend and pay almost $80. The lobster in the roll was perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of butter on it. 5/5 for the roll.  

The second disappointment, the plates and cups. The plates and cups you get for your meal will take you back to your childhood. You eat off plastic plates and drink soup from plastic cups. This was fine when I was a child and eating jam sandwiches and drinking strawberry milk. When I'm paying so much for a meal I expect nice plates. I wouldn't dream of serving food on these to guests at my house let alone paying customers.  I think the owner is trying to keep in with the style of the restaurant which is fun and quirky but this doesn't work at all.  The two most important things when serving food, presentation and taste. You can't present nice food on plates that looks like they came from a garage sale. 

Because the lobster roll was so good it's the type of thing you tell your friends to try but you know they will only try it once because of the price. If it was slightly cheaper you might have it once every few months as a treat  but at its current price, sadly, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"i am not familiar w/ Toronto. we were early for an appointment, so we decided to pull over to see if we could find a spot for a quick lunch. turns out i parked right in front of Smoked & Cracked. fortuitous!

we walked in @ 3:20pm, not knowing they had closed at 3. there were still 2 tables finishing lunch. the waitress apologized for being closed, but the owner told her she should seat us. we're very glad he did.

i had the lobster mac 'n' cheese, my wife had the fishcake sandwich. we were shooting for quick meals, since they were so kind to serve us. my dish was quite good, but we were both blown away by the fishcake. nice smoke, nice overall flavor, just outstanding.

the homemade lemonade had vanilla added, which was curious but worked well with the meals.

we left for our appointment just short of 4pm, and we weren't even the last table. a hearty thank you to the owner and staff for accommodating us, and we'll definitely be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This was probably the best lobster roll I've ever had-served warm with generous portions of tail and claw meat. You get what you pay for. The service was very attentive and friendly. The cozy spot has a great vibe and was a real treat. I really didn't feel like going out but once we got there was happy we did. Greens and Slaw was great. Our daughter loved the fish fry (cod)."}
{"text":"My wife is somewhat of a lobster connoisseur.  She says its up there with the best she's ever had......that's saying something.  I had oysters, mussels and collard greens.  All were excellent.  Anna was our server and she made the evening most enjoyable.  The restaurant is very small with few tables so don't show up without a reservation on Saturday night."}
{"text":"Food was decent, quite overpriced in the end though. The experience started going bad when the waiter visibly scratched his junk as he was confused by our questions on the menu. He was wearing an arsenal jersey, in case the owner is wondering who i'm talking about. The kicker is that we are pretty sure we were ripped off. What we were charged was not what was on the menu, and when we asked why we were given some convoluted reasons that made no sense: \"oh that price is if you combine it with another dish\". I assume this place is going down so they are resorting to ripping off their customers, we didnt argue and wont go back."}
{"text":"Took my friend here for a birthday lunch, the waiter was very nice and took time to explained what's on the menu to us. We ordered the boil lobster, 2 bowls of lobster bisque, a cup of lobster chowder and lobster roll with a side of coleslaw. Everything was good, I will definitely come back many times."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get.  Lobster roll comes with a pound of bland coleslaw and nothing else.  Very small portion of lobster for 30$ on an uneventful bun.  2 of us walked out of this place a 120$ later hungrier than when we walked in.  The atmosphere itself can use a spruce up, but I guess if the food was good I wouldn't of cared."}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to splurge for Valentine's Day and boy were we not disappointed with Smoked & Cracked... the lobster roll is the best I've ever had, hands down. The oysters were fresh and light. The shrimp cocktail was absolutely perfect and the accompanying sauces paired well. Adding to the whole effect was the cozy atmosphere and engaging and friendly staff. You're paying market prices for many of the items but it's well worth it, given the high quality of the meal."}
{"text":"Best lobster roll I've had. Actually, I'd only had a lobster roll once before (at Rock Lobster), but that in comparison, was more of a mayo roll with a little bit of frozen lobster.  I was told by the friendly owner that all the seafood at Smoked & Cracked is flown in fresh from out east.  I loved the atmosphere too.  It's great not have to go downtown for a fun eating experience.  My only complaint were the chips, they were too greasy and hard for my taste."}

But FatCat's memory bubble remind him of last time he was in situation like this (Grand Electric swarming with Hipsters and out-of-work american apparel models, but food end up being really delicious).

{"text":"Incredible.   Stumbled upon this place while walking through the neighbourhood.   Perhaps best seafood I've ever had in Toronto and undoubtably the best smoked salmon.   Cozy and super friendly.   Will be back soon."}
{"text":"I came for lunch last week and really enjoyed the fish fry. It was a bit oily but tasted delish along side the slaw and greens. Small local place and friendly staff. Apparently they fly in the lobster daily. I Am planning on coming again to try other dishes.. Lobster rolls seem to be a popular choice."}
{"text":"A slightly eccentric place, with the owners on site, which always ensures higher degree of quality and service.
Lobster roll; rich, fresh meat and of high quality, and price.
Smoked platter; varied. Somewhat dubious Mussels and Scallops, but fantastic Trout and Halibut.
A decent French Champagne at $100 per btle.
One of their main offerings is to provide packages to take off-site, ( to the cottage ,for example,) This would probably be very worthwhile.
This is a foodie place rather than fine ambience dinning."}
{"text":"Ordered  Seafood minestrone, cup size, for a starter. It's a perfect size if you are planning to eat or taste more of their food, which is in my case I wanted to taste a few things on the menu. Next in line was the P.E.I Oyster, I ordered the 6pcs oysters they all taste creamy and fresh. Then  my mussels came out cooked in garlic, herb and tomato sauce. It was perfectly done, not overcooked. 
To end my dinner I had coffee and small butter pecan tart. The tart were soft and not too sweet, which I like.
The restaurant is a small diner like style, very cozy, the server was very friendly. The food were all cooked perfectly and served in a timely manner. I enjoyed my dinner and I will definitely come back and bring my husband with me next time."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Mac and cheese in the city! For 18$ it's definitely pricey, but they don't skim at all on the huge chunks of fresh lobster they put in it. Not to mention the portion size alone is almost impossible to eat it all in one sitting. 
Pros: portion sizes are huge 
Everything is super fresh
They always have good specials 
The service is warm and inviting and they will happily customize anything you want 
This last time I went I got the smoked seafood Caesar salad (appetizer size), and I still had to pack up half of it! The portions really are huge. I started with the lobster bisque (I like it more than the chowder) 
The best part about the smoked seafood Caesar is that you et to try a bit of all their smoked fish! And of course you get lobster and shrimp as well. So good! 
They also have fresh made butter tarts if you still have room!
Cons: this place is very expensive-definitely more high end. Prices range from 18$-75$ per entree!"}
{"text":"We went here a few times when it first opened and tried several things. The lobster mac n cheese was very sub par. It wasn't bad but it was bland for my tastes. I am from NC so it could be that we just know how to make better mac n cheese here! I've had much better Lobster mac n cheese at the Capital Grill. My canadian boyfriend loved it though. We tried the new england lobster chowder which was very unimpressive as well. For $13 a bowl, I expected more flavor. We tried the lobster bisque once and that was better than the chowder but still nothing I would be dying to go back for.

The one thing I did really enjoy was the lobster roll (warm). I believe it was somewhere around $18 the first time we went. Then the next time we went the following month it was up to around $28. Now I've seen it at $34. Listen, I get it- it's good quality food. But the atmosphere isn't upscale enough to be charging that much for food. We see Smoked and Cracked as a cute drop in, have a quick lunch, and be on our way. And for lunch, we'd rather not drop $80. If we're going to spend that much, we'd rather be in a cozy candle lit booth enjoying a romantic dinner. I have had lobster rolls that I would say I enjoyed slightly better in Chicago that were only $14, and you could double your meat for only $5 more (Da Lobsta). $20 is reasonable for a good portion of lobster. But above that, with that atmosphere, it's a little much. Same thing in Maine--they all average around $20 per roll.

I really wish it was cheaper, because we love lobster and live right around the corner. But we're not spending that kind of money on lunch. 

Unfortunately because of the pricing, we haven't been back since our 2nd visit.
Staff was wonderful though. Very nice people. We did go right when they opened, so maybe one of these days we'll give it another try."}
{"text":"So when you Google \"Smoked & Cracked Toronto\", you get images of our previous mayor. Hmm! Unlike our prior mayor though, I'm certain that this Smoked & Cracked will fit the appetite of many more people. 

In search of a lobster roll, my friends and I traveled here with high hopes and a deep craving. Right away, it set the mood right. We stepped in and were greeted with warmth: both from the staff and in the form of fresh, garlicky flatbread sticks. With the rain outside, the colourful wooden tables, and rustic feel (lots of mason jars), it felt like we were transported to a tiny seaside town. 

The wall menu is split between Lunch and Dinner, with only a few differences between them. You've got the Smoked (smoked fish and other seafoods) and the Cracked (I assume like cracking lobster shells, because you've got lobster rolls, lobster boils, and lobster Mac & Cheese). They've also got cocktails, which are always a great idea. 

We all got either the Lobster Mac & Cheese or the Hot Lobster Roll with Caesar Salad. The Hot Lobster Roll was heaven in a toasted bun. Huge chunks of fresh lobster with a slight buttery finish. I was prepared for it to feel heavy, but it wasn't at all! The homemade Caesar Salad with real bacon bits and seeds was a perfect accompaniment. At $36.50, it's definitely an infrequent indulgence but for the amount of lobster you get, I'd say it's pretty worth. 

For a more affordable alternative, the Lobster Mac & Cheese ($18) also had a respectable amount of lobster. It was served overflowing with deliciously seasoned melted cheese and mac. Perfect comfort food for a rainy day, with just a hint of luxury.

So here I was, thinking I've had lobster rolls before, but clearly that wasn't true until I visited Smoked & Cracked. Nothing I've had in Toronto can hold a candle to that Hot Lobster Roll. I tasted the ocean on that plate. 

(48/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"Its true, the lobster roll is probably the largest you've ever had... fresh east coast lobster with butter or dressing on a bun, however its probably also the most expensive you've ever had! At $29 (think they raised their prices recently) i could buy 2 (1.5lb) lobsters (canadian ones) at the chinese grocery store, boil them and make 3-4 of these for the same price. The seasoning was nothing special either, they need to improve their recipes i think... but i doubt they went to culinary school. Since its not hard to boil a lobster i would say this is not the best value in town... 

I recommend doing that and saving your $60 to go to a fancy restaurant in the city where theres no way in hell you can drum up one of their fancy dishes at home (unless youre a master chef). The $9 cup of lobster chowder was more like vegetable soup with chunks of lobster... not a professional dish for sure.. 

So in summary, boil a lobster at home and eat out at 5 star restaurants... unless you're flippin rich and single.... then call me if you need a dinner companion....Funny, the lady serving us (owner?) talked like a schoolteacher (though staff were all very pleasant) and we felt we were back in 5th grade... the huge chalkboard on the wall with menu items didn't help the cause either..."}
{"text":"No doubt about it: this place is excellent and charming. The lobster roll was probably the best I've ever had: tender, meaty and delicious with a rich nutty flavour. The oysters were as fresh as anywhere I've had in the city, including Rodney's. The wine list is pretty small, but it's smart and the Fumee Blanc matched perfectly. The interior isn't fancy--in fact it's casual to the point of feeling homey, but that's a refreshing change and reflects how focused they are on the food. Definitely one of the best new seafood joints in Toronto--and much more laid back (and affordable) than most."}
{"text":"I am on a mission to find the best lobster roll in Toronto. So I decided to check out Smoked & Cracked last night. We ordered the warm Lobster roll (came with coleslaw) and a Cod Fish Fry (came with coleslaw and potato salad). The lobster roll  certainly was one of the priciest ones I have ordered ($30/roll)!! It was quite delicious and fresh, but not the best lobster roll I have had. The fish fry was flavourful and flaky. Mmmmm! No complains there. I would love to try their lobster mac & cheese next time - the table beside us ordered it and the dish looked delicious. I do have to warn you that their food is quite pricey so do expect to pay alot if you have a big appetite!"}
{"text":"I finally was able to come here to try some of their sumptuous lobster dishes!  It's a small, locally owned restaurant in the Mount Pleasant village. It has only 3 tables! You can view their wide, open-view kitchen from your table.

I ordered the lobster mac & cheese. It was a filling deep dish of mac & cheese pieces with generous portions of freshly cooked lobster! My friend ordered the cold lobster roll. It came with home chips, and with a mayo dressing. Her dish also contained generous lobster portions!

I am going to return for their 1.5lb lobster boil!

It is a bit pricy b/c they charge you based on market prices. But if you love lobster, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner to Smoked & Cracked with a large group of people (10 of us) and left a bit disappointed with my experience. The food itself was pretty good, but a few items were just average. 

I ordered the lobster chowder and and a regular sized hot lobster roll ($35) with a side of kale caesar salad. The large lobster roll, dubbed \"The Big Crack\" was a whopping $65. Worth it? Not according to the one person in our group who ordered it. It didn't look much bigger than mine, to be honest. I wish I'd gotten a photo of the two of them side by side for comparison. 

The chowder was under-seasoned and had only two small pieces of lobster in it. I ended up ordering a cup of lobster bisque after my meal, as I was still hungry. The bisque was much better than the chowder, although it was a bit on the salty side. Maybe it got the salt that was supposed to go in the chowder?!

The lobster roll was really quite good, though. Nice, big, buttery chunks of lobster on an amazingly soft, toasted roll. I especially enjoyed the kale caesar. It's odd that there was no mention of kale on the menu board, though (or by our server). One of the girls in our group said she really hated kale and wouldn't have ordered it if she'd known. She did eat some, but gave the majority of it to the person next to her. 

The problem I have with this place is that they refuse to split bills. They just give you one bill for your group and expect you to figure it out. All fine and dandy, unless you ask questions about the gratuity! Our server didn't know what percentage she used to calculate the gratuity, and then got all flustered when I asked if it was on the pre- or post-tax total. Plus, there were three different amounts for the tax on the bill, and she couldn't answer when we asked what the difference was. For the record, they charge an 18% gratuity on the post-tax total, so you are paying tip on top of the HST. This is pretty sneaky, in my opinion. Had the service been really good, I wouldn't have cared, but it wasn't. 

I needed to leave early and wanted to make sure I was paying the right amount, but it was like pulling teeth to get this sorted out. She ended up sending the manager (owner?) over to answer questions. How hard can it be? It took about 30 minutes to figure out how much each of us were supposed to pay. What a nightmare. I don't think I'd go back with a large group again unless we were sharing everything and splitting the bill evenly at the end. 
Such a shame, really. This could've been a great place for a work dinner."}
{"text":"This could be my favourite seafood place in Toronto. Excellent service, nice warm home feeling atmosphere.

Tried these dishes:

HOT lobster roll ($31 market price): I feel it is the best hot lobster roll in Toronto, though there isn't that much competition in the hot lobster roll space.  I think it's comparable to a good Boston place(except neptunes), there are big chunks of lobster and very buttery. Comes with a selection of salad or you can get potato salad for extra. I think the price is fine, it's normal for a HOT lobster roll to be around this price, it is what it is and you won't find a good one like this for cheap please tell me if you find one (you won't) because I'll go there every single day.

Lobster chowder: got just a cup and there were 3-4 huge chunks of lobster in this cup. It was very pleasing. Probably the best lobster chowder I ever had.

Smoke house board: shared the one person, it's good for two people. I think it's too much for one.  The meats were interesting, I never tried smoked duck and wild sturgeon before and they were quite tasty and meaty. Also came with smoked salmon, mussels, and shrimp. Really enjoyed the smoke house board.

Overall, Smoked and Cracked is definitely way out of the way for me, but I will likely go out of the way to come back for the superb lobster chowder and hot lobster roll."}
{"text":"Wonderful local find with top notch fresh seafood and warm staff. 

We ordered the seafood platter to start - pricey but the variety and freshness made it worth it. We then got a bowl of lobster chowder and the cold lobster roll (which came with salad). The chowder was ok. The standout was really the lobster roll. Huge chucks of lobster, no fillers, warm bread - pure heaven. Dessert was homemade - just ok. In terms of the staff, they are friendly, attentive and obviously love to work there. Overall a great find!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a true foodie and am always on the search for a new excellent in any dining experience. I wanted a superb lobster bisque soup to serve at home. Pisces does a fairly good job doing a creamless version but you have to add a significant amount of lobster to make it worthy in my opinion. The only other places that I experienced excellence in this category were Rodney's and Auberge Du Pommier.....and that's tough territory. Anyway the bisque was amazing  and my guests raved about it . In the spirit of the season the owner said he had added some extra lobster. The soup was chunked with delicious morsels of claw and tail and the depth of flavor was outstanding.I went hunting for superb and certainly found it at Smoked and Cracked."}
{"text":"Ridiculously priced lobster roll at $30; the most wallet draining one I've ever had!  The texture of the meat tasted as if it were previously sitting in the fridge for awhile, and the bun was lukewarm bun (hot buns are the way to go!). Was super disappointed since they prided themselves as GTA's #1, but the quality truly did not justify what was paid. The lobster chowder however was reasonably priced at $13--not bad, but overpoweringly salty. So after a $56 snack, we went to McD to have a delicious meal that did not cost an arm and a leg. Won't return ever again."}
{"text":"I regularly dream about the lobster bisque here. I think I'm drooling just thinking about it. You can get a 1L take out for $25 (around 2.5 bowls or so)!

Their lobster rolls are also really good, but the price increased to $29 or so from under $20, so sadly I won't be having many of them in the future."}
{"text":"This place is way over priced and average at best. Been a couple of times and would not go back. Had the bisque and lobster roll and both are very bland and not worth the wait or the cost. Very limited selection of beverages too and also over priced. Not an enjoyable atmosphere either with only a few tables with chairs that are suited more for sunday school.

I'm not sure how this place is still open but I guess their catering business keeps them afloat. 

Much better places if you venture a bit north on mt pleasant or west to yonge."}
{"text":"What a great spontaneous decision to come here. We ordered the seafood platter, regular sized hot lobster roll, and the fresh mussel provencal. I loved everything and it was the right amount for 2 people. If you like BUTTER, seafood, and garlic.. this place will be heavenly. 

The seafood platter had smoked salmon, candied salmon, shrimp, and clams or mussels (i forget- i devoured everything quickly). It came with garlic bread sticks and cream cheese too. The hot lobster roll is everything that you could expect. Rich and buttery, so much so that it was dripping melted butter. Just wonderful. And the last thing to come to our table was the mussels. Super flavourful and we dipped all our bread in the sauce afterwards. Okay, maybe I took a couple spoonfuls too. 

Only reason why I'm deducting one star is for the price and staff. The price is a little expensive for what it is. And although the staff were polite to us, there seemed to be some tension amongst themselves behind the scenes. There was some over-controlling personalities and subtle blaming happening. It kind of made me feel bad for this one lady. That made our dining experience somewhat uneasy to witness."}
{"text":"One of the best seafood meals I've ever had. What a great spot to go with friends.. totally unpretentious decor, friendly service and one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. Also the best smoked duck prosciutto I've ever had. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Seafood...a genre of food that, if not executed perfectly, will run a poor review as well as a night with your porcelain friend.  So why would anyone want to dabble with seafood when it has such a small room for error?  I'll tell you why, because if you can perfect it, everyone will be ranting about it for years to come.  Smoked & Cracked is where they've perfected their execution.  Be warned, this is not fine dining, but its fine comfort dining at its very best!  

I've been to many seafood places where they add a lot to the dish hoping to trick you into believing that you're getting more.  Often times, you spend half your evening looking for that 1 lobster claw they promised.  At Smoked & Cracked, there is no filler.  They give you that entire lobster when you order the entire lobster.  Even if you don't order the entire lobster, they put as much lobster or seafood as humanly possibly in every dish and this is why people come back.

Lets start with the fact that you're not walking into a grand ballroom or banquet hall, so reservations are highly recommended (even on a Tuesday).  The owner greets you every time and is already on high energy to accommodate and make your dinner as pleasant as possible.  Once seated, you'll see a wall full of wine and drink choices as well as one for food.  My recommendation for drinks, would be their LOBSTER CAESAR!  I know you can go and get a bottle of Clamato Caesar mix, but this place does it right.  Everything from scratch and the flavours are incredible.  PLUS...they throw in an entire lobster claw as a topper.  That's enough for me!

Now onto the food:  this flattened lobster roll breadstick they bring to the table is already buttered and just melts.  I think I tried sneaking some out in my pockets.  The SMOKED BOARD is a must and a great way to share at the table.  Amazing flavours from the duck to the salmon and the sturgeon! The board comes with a small dish of DRUNKEN MUSSELS that makes you want to order the DRUNKEN MUSSELS as well.  Now onto the main event:  LOBSTER ROLL.  wow! talk about packing as much lobster into a funny cut piece of bread.  The butter oozing from all directions of the roll and sliding down your hands as you try to wrestle with this enormous lobster thing.  (SIDE NOTE: their caesar salad is incredible! I don't know what it is, but it blows my mind away).  The MAC & CHEESE we ordered thinking we didn't have enough food, but were mistaken.  We had enough food, but we still managed to devour this cheesy, buttery mound of indulgence that I think I wept a little as I was stuffing my face.

SMOKED & CRACKED...seafood perfection!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Smoked and Cracked is a welcome addition to the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood and its homey atmosphere fits right in with the other old time shops. I was surprised the owners weren't right up and front handling everything but their waitress was fantastic. You will likely be sharing a large table with someone else.

I ATE 
I had the hot lobster roll, which comes with potato chips. Note to owners: potato chips should always be an option, in my opinion. I'd rather have a pickle for free on the side opposed to potato chips. Their moshie pickle, which is shipped in from Montreal is one big ass pickle and one of the best I have ever had. Ohh yeah, pickle juice all over the lobster roll!

Speaking of the lobster roll, you get a mofo heaping of lobster (moreso on the cold roll than the hot roll, as I observed). Mine was a bit heavy on the butter so if you're not a butter fan, maybe make the request or go for the cold roll. 

Though this one is the only shop in TO that is comparable to Luke's Lobster in NYC, it is EXPENSIVE. For a roll, lemonade and pickle + tax and tip, my bill came out to $23. A CUP of chowder is $6.95. Buster's Sea Cove charges a similar price for their chowder but it's a huge bowl. 

Is it worth it? Once in a while. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Rob Ford may be lurking around because of the name (Oh SNAP) but their rolls will have you quickly addicted!"}
{"text":"Love this place!

Definitely worth the price.  The food was some of the best I've ever had.  I came with 3 other people and we shared everything.

The smoked platter is great as an app for 4.  We had Mac and cheese lobster, lobster roll, Panko breaded cod and stuffed salmon. It was perfect and delicious.

They have a sparkling wine called HI from Italy that was a great compliment to the meal.

The staff are very pleasant and make you feel like you've known them forever, the service was great and the staff were very informative and helpful.

I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was extremely disappointing very bland. Any lobster bisque that I've had before including from a can tasted better. 

Their coleslaw that the waitress said was excellent was bland as well. It's very unfortunate that they don't have a salt shaker at the table to make up for the bland food. Extremely high priced which is fine if the food is good but it was below average. Hard to believe they charge $30 for a lobster roll in a place where none of the chairs are comfortable or even match."}
