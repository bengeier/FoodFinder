{"text":"I was only slightly hesitant to try HCC after it changed hands from its predecessor, Lee's Wok (which I enjoyed very much on occasion). Thank you Hazel M. for the first legitimate review of the new place, it's what sent me there today.

From my first experience, I'll simply run through items that I felt could be compared to Lee's Wok.

I ordered the General Tao lunch special to go. For $7.50 it included either a bottled water or a choice of two soups, corn or hot and sour. Like Lee's I was able to substitute the white rice with fried rice for $1.00 more. I chose the hot and sour soup. (Although comparable in price, Lee's lunch special included a water or a pop, not soup).

The woman that greeted me and took my order was very cordial and conversational (at 12:30pm, I was the only customer in the place). I presumed that she was the proprietor. She invited me to have a seat while I waited and I was promptly served my order.

My meal was completely what I expected. The gently spicy General Tao had lost some of its initial crisp during my drive back to the office but it was still good. I found that the breading on the chicken, specifically the un-sauced pieces, had a very recognizable \"generic, frozen, out-of-a-box\" kind of taste. Think what you'd expect a President's Choice frozen chicken nugget to taste like. This wasn't a problem however, since the majority of it was covered by a nicely flavoured sauce, more complex in taste than Lee's was, more fruity with whole dried chilies within). The fried rice too had more of a fruity/flowery flavour than most fried rice dishes I've had from fast food establishments. The hot and sour soup left me with few words for comment. Not good, not bad, just... there.

Yup, 4 stars. Yay! I'm a fan. It was exactly what I expected and exactly what I felt like eating today. I'll be back for a different dish soon."}
{"text":"As you may have read- Hakka Canadian has taken over Lee Wok's.

I have tried a few items and I wasnt impressed but one day I went and tried the Manchurian Chicken- asked for it extra spicy and extra saucy.

Phenomenal. I am not going to try anything else on menu as this item seems to be the only one that they are doing really right. I recommended to some folks at work as well. Everybody who tried it has raved about it.

They say the same thing- chilli chicken was off and so was the other items.

Try their Manchurian chicken. Ask for it saucy and spicy. You wont be disappointed.

Chunks of well marinate golden fried chicken cooked in the perfect blend of sauce and spices and heavily proportioned over a large quantity of rice. Soo good!!!


4 stars for 1 Item.
2 stars for everything else I have tried so far"}
{"text":"This review and my experience at Hakka Canadian Cafe is very memorable, as this is actually the FIRST TIME I tried Hakka food. I have always thought Hakka food is not for me, as I am not a fan of spicy food. But I am so glad I gave this place a shot.

Formerly Lee's Wok, new owners have taken over and changed the name to Hakka Canadian Cafe.

I took about 5 minutes contemplating on the menu, as I do not know what to get. All options appear spicy. So I told the owner (I think) that I don't eat spicy. So she recommended the General Tao chicken. Well looking at the menu, I could probably try the Garlic chicken, or even the Sweet and Sour chicken. But the owner said I should try general tao, so I did.

And I am glad I did!! The chicken was sooo fresh and tasty, and was very saucy! My BF got the Manchurian chicken and he found it was an IMPROVEMENT on the taste from what the former restaurant offered. So over-all, the food was so good and it is an assurance that we will be coming back, and maybe more often this time while I try more hakka dishes.

Service is good and plenty. Food was ready in 5 mins. Place is clean, thought it wasn't so busy. Hopefully this review would get the restaurant more visitors."}
{"text":"This place is truly what a \"DUMP RESTAURANT\" would look like. They have the worst customer service I ever experienced in my life. In the past they always would mess up my order but I stopped going to them. I recently saw the owner and she was begging me to come back but i said no even offering free food. 

I called not to long ago and asked if they were permanently closed and she had the nonsense to ask me if i wanted to order something. I said \"are you permanently closed or not?\" she goes ya we're closed you want to place an order?

I gave her some choice words on how to run a proper business and hung up. 

So after all that not sure if this place is in business or not but if you ever went here and they're actually still open? Do not give them business or any business they run."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Very friendly staff. They make you feel very welcomed. Overall, great place for a quick meal - in and out."}
{"text":"Chicken pakora came looking like somebody ate half of them. The hot sause they gave was almost empty. Hot and sour soup had little to no taste. Chili chicken was ok. The beef fried rice was again tasteless. The beef was tossed on top like they forgot about it. Definitely not going to order from here again. Over priced for poor quality food."}
{"text":"Honestly extremely nice staff and I feel bad almost due to great customer service. Got delivery and the process and phone mannerism was great! Could not be happier. This rating is solely for the food. And sadly I must say; i've had significantly better hakka for cheaper prices... But if your looking for a quick bite on new years day... the service is by far great. 

Had the shrimp pakora which I found was too much batter and couldn't find the shrimp alot of the time... the beef fried rice was bountiful and was pretty good. And the General Tao Shrimp was definitely disappointing as the shrimp wasn't the best of quality and in a really thick sauce and laced with more onions than anything else. But as I said not a terrible food experience just simply have had better."}
{"text":"This place replaced Lee's wok which I frequented many times during my high school years. 

Based on food, and price, this place sucks in my books. Overpriced, smaller servings and the food itself will never replace what I use to enjoy from Lees. 

Better food can be had elsewhere in Markham (Hakka King, Tangerine, fredericks). And the price is mostly the same if not cheaper."}
