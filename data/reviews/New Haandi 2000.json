{"text":"Been ordering from New Haandi for quite a while and never, ever had an experience quite like this...

First off, the food took 2.5 hours to arrive. Crazy, right? Best part is, it was the wrong order. Call and we're told \"Uh, can't you just eat that one?\" Uh, no! Finally convince them to send a new order. It arrives 35 minutes later. I don't even get a sorry AND they asked for the wrong food back. Luckily Just Eat stepped up and refunded our money.

This will be my last order."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered off of Just Eat a few weeks ago. The food that arrived actually tasted decent, but was lukewarm at best. However, both of our stomachs spent the next two days letting us know that we probably didn't make the best choice of restaurant."}
{"text":"We got delivery yesterday and I loved the food. It was exactly what I wanted when I was craving indian. The portions were good we had enough for about 3 plates between my boyfriend and I.

We ordered butter chicken, rice, goat curry, chicken pakora and naan bread. It was all filling and just enough spice.

Definitely will be calling them again soon."}
{"text":"I was super hungry and craving for good Indian food. I  wanted something tasty and good on quantity. $13 buffet with good food and excellent service is more than I expected. The ambiance is good enough. The place is clean and the new waitress Kamala is very friendly. I would go there again in this week :)"}
{"text":"I feel like this place has read the reviews and made some significant changes. 

To be honest we ordered from this place because the name tickled our fancy but I have continued to order from here.      I\"m not a world traveller, nor have I been brought up on Indian food but I've always enjoyed my meals.  Sometimes the naan is a little undercooked but since I usually order enough for a few meals and am reheating the naan this actually works out for me.  also, the pakoras tend to be on the oily side so I don't bother with those.   Delivery is on time, or reasonably close and the driver really is a lovely man."}
{"text":"My sister and I have ordered delivery from New Haandi twice and both times we have been completely satisfied. The food is delicious, arrives nice and hot, and our orders have been perfect each time. We also get plenty for leftovers too. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I waited 25 minutes for take out food. There was no one in the restaurant. It was the worst, most bland, shrimp biryani ever. No veggies. No flavour just rice shrimp and a bit of week spice. Meh. I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"i ate here last night with one of my friends. we were in town for a conference and decided to check out little india. this was one of the place that seemed to have some patronage. the buffet was pretty good. lot of different dishes (goat curry, chicken curry), chicken buriani. the food was good. but not spectacular, although the mango lassi was solid. the cheetah's beer was no kingfisher but it did the job. this is a solid choice for relatively cheap north indian food buffet style. we ending up spending $28 each w/ tip (but we both had the buffet, a mango lassi and a beer)."}
{"text":"This was the worst Indian food I have ever eaten.

I have eaten Indian food from the very high end to the street food variety and I have never come across anything so bad, any where, in any country. I am actually shocked.

The papadums were so greasy i could feel the oil in run as I but into them. I had the dupiaza and vindaloo and I could not tell the difference between them other than one being hotter than the other. Neither tasted like a curry, in fact, either tasted of anything. The curries were so runny it was like water. The chicken over boiled and bland - disgusting in fact. The garlic naan was so limp and greasy it left a residue of grease on my hands, the garlic was raw in places and the bread tasted of nothing.

The rice was cooked. That's as far as my positivity extends.

DO NOT EAT FROM HERE"}
{"text":"We always order food for delivery from New Haandi.  Food is decent but it typically takes 1.5 -2 hours to get from Little India (where they're located) to Leslieville - not that far away.  By that time, we're ravenous and pacing the floor wondering where the %#! our food is.  We'll be finding another Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood with more respect for their order-in clientele."}
{"text":"Good local indian option. We have now ordered a few times from this spot and have enjoyed it each time. the price is reasonable, the chicken tikka is a favourite in our house, and the daal is amazing!. glad we found this indian option!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in town. Vindaloo, Butter Chicken, Naan, standard fair items are super delicious. I definitely recommend eating here, take-out or delivery."}
{"text":"Great Indian place a buddy told me about some time ago.  Their buffet is full and diverse.  But their menu items are where they shine.  I recommend:

Lamb Korma
Lamb or Chicken Biriyani
Garlic Naan
Tandoori Chicken

Great place for a business meeting or a social occasion.  The place is not rushed and they have 2 tandoors.  Run by happy family.  

And they deliver!  Pick-up as well."}
{"text":"Went here recently to get my fix of Indian food and little India (Gerrard).
Was a little later on a Thursday night and after getting a ticket 2 minutes after parking my car, I was looking forward to a good meal to take my mind off of the f'n $40 ticket.

However, Haandi didn't deliver as much as I had hoped. I think it's just timing and freshness. Although they had a nice variety, the place just wasn't busy and the food was probably a little better at Lunch. When I say food - I mean the buffet. Nice variety, just really lacking freshness and the exotic rich taste I come to expect from Indian food.

The staff seemed quite nice and accommodating, it's unfortunate because it's got potential. I would suggest going when the place is busy or at a busier time - friday night, or lunch and ONLY if the place is busy. Otherwise I'd give this place a miss and default to the tried and true Lahore Tikka house. I guess it's the turnover of the buffet. I didn't order off the menu, so perhaps that's a better route to go."}
{"text":"Food was excellent.i had butter chicken and butter naan. And chickpeas crisp with olive oil. Ordered tandoori chicken to go"}
{"text":"Ordered of JustEat, delivery was very slow and when the food arrived it was extremely bland.  Even the naan has zero flavour."}
{"text":"I recently gave this place another shot and I am glad I did.

The food is always great and well worth the price. They are open weekends in the daytime which is a plus (a lot of other Indian places don't open until dinner time)

Love their butter chicken and the naan bread is massive! We usually order off just-eat

The spices are pretty mild which is nice, (you can always ask for more heat)

In  the past my only issue is that sometimes it can take about 2 hours for delivery so be prepared , but today they were here in less than an hour. I guess it depends on how busy they are . Delivery guy is very friendly too 

I recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is a not too bad place if you are looking for a cheap buffet with a decent selection.

The service was great, they topped my water off frequently and were talkative about the food, and our comfort.

The food is pretty good, but nothing amazing.  It is clearly \"watered\" down and lacks that real indian kick.

You won't be disappointed if you come here, but the service, cleanliness, and selection make it a great place for lunch, or quick non fancy dinner."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here, I usually don't write reviews but I really enjoyed the food and the customer service! We usually eat at Regency Restaurant a few stores down, but their service has drastically decreased over the years (closes at 11, but refuse service past 10:30). Glad my friend and I stopped here tonight. This will be our new favorite place for buffet."}
{"text":"I used to come here as a child. Back before the invasion of the other types of restaurants on the block, and before the rent went up tenfold. 
And of course, before the new, somewhat unfortunate name. 2000. It reminds me of those ancient hotmail accounts and Geocities usernames. Anyway, it used to be called Haandi. 

After a very long gap in my life, I decided to give Haandi an option to return, and came here for a lunch buffet. The restaurant itself is very dated, as most restaurants in Little India are. 

However, the food itself is quite delicious. Haandi does tandoori chicken really well, along with many of their vegetarian dishes. I find myself avoiding this place lately as it makes me break the second cardinal sin. However, the friends I had with me were also raving about it afterwards. That always feels great. 

You're welcome."}
{"text":"Just ordered off of just eat and it was terrible. The butter chicken tastes like they threw a can of cream of tomato soup on processed chicken pieces. You were lucky if you could find a piece in the dish full of liquid. The only thing that was ok was the tandoori chicken and the plain basmati rice. The naan was really dry. I have a ton left over, normally it is the first to go in my house. The vegetable dishes were flavourless mush. I will never order from them again. Pretty disappointed after spending $80"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow .... we had arguably the worst meal of our lives at the buffet here last week.  I live in the hood and am aware that buffets are not noted for their high quality, and have found Haandi to be fine in the past - but when we went at 630 (prime dinner time we thought - to avoid the food 'sitting to long' phenomenon) we realized that we were eating leftovers from lunch - the rice was hard and crispy (how do you screw up rice??) the chana masala had turned to mush and pretty much everything was barely warm.  

The server was super apologetic and offered us some freshly cooked pakoras, so service was not the issue - but serving food that has been out for hours and hours is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Stopped here while waiting for our sari tops to be altered. Great place! The service was wonderful--very helpful and timely. We had vegetable samosas and they brought us chickpea side dish and several sauces to go with them. Very good! Also had saag paneer which was soooo good. One of my favorite Indian dishes. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I have never ordered take out from an All You Can Eat, but it was the worse experience. I ordered Channa Bhatura, but than the server said he gave me something similar instead. I enjoy any Indian food in general, so thought it should be fine. The Channa tasted like bad daal mixed with chick peas and a hint of masala. The Bhatura was deep fried crispy bread. It just broke apart. Together it tasted so bad that I felt like throwing up for quite some time. I'm sure they make other things well, but don't add things if you can't make it. I had to throw the rest of the food away. What a waste."}
{"text":"We have tried this place out a couple times and been quite happy with the experience.

Their tandoori chicken is so tender and flavourful.
They also have a buffet during the day on the weekends.
They bring fresh naan to your table -- nice and hot!

All the usual buffet dishes including butter chicken, rice, daal etc.
Very reasonable prices for the lunch buffet.
We always leave feeling quite full!  A sign of when it's a good buffet.

The servers are very friendly and attentive.
Good mango lassi as well!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been a delivery regular for some time now, but this is the last time.

Delivery took almost three hours after being given a time of 55 minutes. I called Just Eat at the 1.5 hour mark because I couldn't get a hold of the restaurant. They said the restaurant would call right away, but they didn't. I had to call them and they said 15 minutes tops. It is the only reason why I didn't just cancel. I called again after 30 minutes and was told the driver would be there in a few minutes. Needless to say, food came almost three hours later. So late that we just put it in the fridge. 

Totally ruined our night. Never again."}
{"text":"Found this place because we wanted to try Lahore Tikka House but it was closed for renovations. Boy, am I glad we did. We had buffet lunch for $10.99 each. Buffet included Butter Chicken, Pakoras, Daal, Saag, Mutton Curry, rice, Chicken Tikka and much more. There was a salad bar and ice cream as well. Fresh naan brought to the table was seemingly unlimited and included in the price. Though it wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had, it was very enjoyable and well seasoned. Service was lovely and we felt very appreciated. I will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant would have gotten two stars if it weren't for the cockroach I spotted in the restaurant!

The food was disappointing; it wasn't spicy enough and lacked flavour. All in all, it was plain and bland. I'll admit though, the service we received was quite great; however there were only three tables occupied in total so he didn't have a lot on his hands.

My verdict is stay away from this place unless you like finding cockroaches and eating bland, flavourless food."}
{"text":"I have never, and I mean ever had a more disgusting food. I feel compelled to warn others.
I spent 35$ for delivery, ordered chicken madras which tasted like gravy with a kilo of salt in it.
Everything was ridiculously salty, absolutely inedible. I didn't call to complain as I couldn't be bothered to argue but the food went to the garbage."}
{"text":"Free delivery through Just-eat.ca in under an hour. It's pretty good. 3 dishes (2 vegetarian, 1 butter chicken) and a naan costs about $30. 

Not the best butter chicken or saag paneer, and the eggplant dish I wouldn't recommend, but it's cheap compared to other places and quite good.

The butter chicken was quite watery. I'd have to agree with Eric that everything seemed a bit watered down."}
