{"text":"Ordered a sheet cake for my Daughters first birthday (5 days in advance) with two designs picked out of the book. When my husband went to pick it up on my daughters birthday, staff looked for the cake several times, in all their freezers and could not find it and my husband was told it was not there. Had to get a rush cake done quickly with horrible flower designs, quickly piped out in red (were supposed to be colorful flowers with a butterfly). Called to complain the days following and was told the cake was there and waiting and we never came to pick it up. I was then told I could still come pick up the cake, which I agreed to, thinking no one else would be able to use the personalized cake. The manager called back about 30 min later telling me since I was given a sheet cake on the day we came to pick it up, I could not have the one I had designed for my daughter. I asked what would become of the cake since it had my daughters name on it, and was told it would be 'edited'. I was offered coupons instead for the inconvenience, but my husband and I decided not to bother picking them up since we will never, ever give this location a single cent of our money ever again."}
{"text":"Reviewing a Dairy Queen is an odd proposition: do you review it by Dairy Queen standards, in which case you have to compare it to all the other DQ experiences, or do you review it by an absolute standard of DQ versus all other ice creams?    In a sense, reviewing a Dairy Queen is like reviewing a McDonald's or any other chain place: if someone's going, \"Oh, jeez, what is this 'Burger King' place?\" they're probably sufficiently culinarily clueless that they're not going to BE on Yelp.  So let's be honest here: It's Dairy Queen.  If you know what you're getting, then you either like it or you don't.  By DQ standards, it's a good four to five stars; it's clean, the ice cream flows steadily, and the staff is nice.    But if you like ice cream at all -   - well, not to be snobbish.  Lord knows I gave it a shot, because it's the only ice cream store within easy walking distance from my house, and I'd love to have a sundae that I could get merely by walking a half a mile.  And I did have some childhood memories of DQ fondness.    So I went the first week it was open, and got myself a nice hot fudge sundae with vanilla ice cream, and lo!  Though the fudge was nicely gooey for the brief moment it was hot, the ice cream underneath was a combination of chilled styrofoam and half-recycled plastic - utterly lacking in flavor.  It was cool, and it didn't melt easily, and that was about what you could say for it.    But hey!  Some of you really like the air-puffed stuff, and if you do, well, it's going to give you that Dairy Queen experience.  It's also good for the kids, 'cause it's cheap.  If you're a little pickier, however - and I encourage you to be - then there are several of Cleveland's delectable custard stands about the neighborhood, many within easy driving distance, and if you've got the car check them out."}
{"text":"Only 1 star due to my family I going there last night and despite posted hours being till 11 pm ( it was 10:35 pm) they were closed. We pulled up and high school customers just left. As we got out the dq worker locked up. We knocked and they came to the door saying they were closed.  When we asked why since the hours in the window clearly stated 11pm, the said bc \"some schools are still in session\"....didn't make sense to us.   With competing places that are not far from there, like menchies, Baskin robbins and east coast, you would think dq would have better service. Even if ur closing early , if we just get there and u let customers out,  just serve us. It's looks bad to close early or to deny us business when you just had some. We won't go back. We can just got to one of the other places down the road for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"It's birthday season in our family so we bought a couple of ice cream cakes from DQ.  Great service, even helping us to get one decorated on a Friday night when we were in a bind but they didn't have a cake decorator working.  I have no idea what the ingredient list is for the ice cream cake and probably prefer not to know, but I was pleasantly surprised that the substantial packaging that protected the round cakes was all #1 plastic which can easily be recycled locally.  The sheet cakes were in cardboard that is also simple to recycle around here.  Thanks for not making me throw away 3 pounds of plastic!"}
{"text":"Dang from the reviews people be really hating on this DQ! Chill, it's just soft serve ice cream.   The only thing I have ever gotten from here is the Triple Chocolate Brownie. So. Good.   Let me explain, it's a warmed up brownie with vanilla ice cream, cocoa fudge, choco chunks, and whipped cream. Praise be to the sweet little baby Jesus! It satisfies my dessert cravings and I often find it's big enough for me to eat half now and save the other half for another night.   So treat yo self to some DQ and remember, the employees are mostly just a bunch of high school kids trying to be responsible and work an after school job, stop the hate. (And to the reviewer who has kids yelling at them for their ice cream treat not being perfect, throw that treat in the trash and make them walk their little ungrateful butts home.)  If you're looking to fancy and to support local, check out Mitchell's on Detroit."}
{"text":"DQ is such a nostalgic place, I'm a sucker for their chocolate dipped cone in the summer. The location is always busy so I'm not the only one that enjoys an ice cream treat from DQ. I'm not much for their other menu offerings though."}
{"text":"3rd time we tried to get 3 blizzards from this DQ.... All three times they couldn't get it right. My 10 yr old was so incredible upset with me for giving this store yet another chance. \"Daddy you know they always mess the order up why did you go there??!!!\" She was so mad at me and cried...  Never again.....From now on I will drive to the North Olmsted DQ store. You'll wait longer in line but you won't get yelled at from your kids because they screwed up the order,, again!!"}
{"text":"This DQ actually makes its own cakes so you can ordered whatever you'd like. It was cool to watch them and see how everything comes together."}
{"text":"I spent many a summer walking over to this Dairy Queen as a kid. Since the plaza has gone under a revitalization in the last couple years the Dairy Queen has followed suit.  It now has an Orange Julius with it.  The store has been fully reno'd and is looking quite nice as it was very old and run down until recently."}
