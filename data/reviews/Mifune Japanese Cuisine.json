{"text":"The Omakase sushi is expensive however it is totally unique among all the sushi restaurants you will find in the Markham area!

So don't go for the usual sushi, but try the unique ones! Iwashi among others! 
Also look at the color of the salmon... you know this is not ordinary sushi.

And the melting fatty Tuna!

It is expensive but generous piece of fish.

Good service.

Don't go if you are in a rush and be patient as it is busy on week-ends.
Don't expect a traditional japanese decor."}
{"text":"We were planning to go to Shinobu for dinner, but unfortunately they were fully booked for the night (we arrived before 6pm since we didn't make a reservation, we were hoping it wouldn't be full so early). Determined to eat sushi for dinner, we decided to go to J-Town to try out Mifune.

Stepping into the restaurant, the decor seemed more Western then Japanese. The place was pretty empty, only 2 tables occupied when we got there. The hostess was very nice and told us about their specials and popular menu items.

We decided to try the Tuna Roll, Sushi & Sashimi Dinner, and the Ume Chirashi. The hostess mentioned that the Sardine nigiri was one of the specials, so we gave that a try as well. We originally wanted to try the Duck Tataki on the menu, but they said it wasn't available today.

Complimentary salad and miso soup came fairly quickly, followed by our sardine nigiri and tuna roll. We've never tried sardine nigiri before, but it seemed pretty fresh. The hostess suggested dipping a slice of ginger in soy sauce and eat it with the sushi. The sushi and sashimi dinner was pretty good, came with 6 pieces of nigiri and 3pcs salmon, 3 pcs tuna, 2pcs mackerel sashimi. I liked the mackerel sashimi as they rarely have that in a set meal in most japanese restaurant. Ume Chirashi was also a very good size (for me at least), and came with a decent amount of sashimi and some other veggies (lotus roots, pickled radish). All very fresh. 

By the time we were done dinner, the place was a lot more crowded. I'm surprised this place has such a low rating. The staff were very polite, tea cup always refilled with hot tea, food was fresh and delicious. I thought the overall experience was pretty decent and i would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"one of the very few uptown places that actually know/care about the fish they serve. Our server took the time to explain our dishes to us, and it was a great change of pace from the usual AYCE places. 

Their menu is pretty standard compared with other non buffet Japanese restaurants, but the food is definitely better quality than the average place."}
{"text":"I was very excited to see the first two restaurants open in J-Town. Then Shiso Tree opened. And now, Mifune has been added to the roster of restaurants in this plaza. It is hidden in the corner right beside Shiso Tree.

We had made reservations to try the place out and the interior is very big: spacious, light, with generous round tables for seating. The story is that there is one main sushi/sashimi chef who used to work at the Prince Hotel, Katsura and he goes shopping for the ingredients of the day himself. Needless to say, everything is fresh.

Menu. We tried a variety of items including the Omakase set at $44.95 which includes toro sushi and sahimi, Tako, Shrimp, Roe, Eel and Egg. The presentation is small and delicate and as an appetizer, we devoured it really fast. I thought it was a bit pricy for the size and quantity we got, and the rice chunks kept on breaking. I like my sushi rice sticky. Delicious nonetheless. Other appetizers included the wonderfully cooked eggplant in fish broth (YUM!) and a disappointing Kaorage (sorry about the spelling). 

My father had the Sea Bass which is an appetizer but is sizeable for a main course. The actual fish was oh so tender, but I didn't fancy the orang-y sauce it was covered in. I had the Tempura Udon, but the main attraction of the night was my mom's Beefsteak. It comes with corn and potatoes and this beef just melteddddd in my mouth. It was so unexpected, and juicy, that I quickly devoured half of my mom's steak...leaving her to order another Tempura Soba for herself.

FYI. THERE IS NO ALCOHOL as of yet. The main lady stated that they are waiting for their license, so if you wanted to pair your dinner with some fine Sake...you're going to have to wait.

Service. While the service from our waitress was absolutely amazing, it was very slow. Towards the latter part of the evening, the restaurant was busy with big groups of 6 and 12 filling the restaurant. I only saw three wait staff which was clearly not enough for the amount of people. I understand this restaurant is fairly new, so hopefully, the kinks will work itself out.

I really want to like this restaurant, but the food for the price, is nothing outstanding. The total bill for 4 people including tax and tip came out to be $190. Sushi portions are small, but beautifully presented and quality is great. I don't think I will be returning anytime soon, but I am very excited for Mifune and hope it can last."}
{"text":"I usually don't post for Japanese restaurants because I like them all but I had a really good time at Mifune. Although, it is hidden inside J-Town between a Toyota and a Lexus dealership, the outside ambiance was very quaint. 

As you walk in, it reminds me of 10 Forward on the Enterprise with the pastel coloured seats. The decor was very nice, I loved the purple and there was a very outside feel with the windows and trees near the dining room entrance. 

The waitresses were very attentive and quick to help us and made sure that our water and hot tea was always full. 

For our meal, my wife and two children were able to share their Teriyaki chicken, we did order more rice. Miso soup and salad were served to all. The rest of my family and I (5 people) shared a platter of sushi and sashimi, there was a lot and it took us about an hour to eat it. 

The washrooms are downstairs but because I was having trouble walking the waitress offered up an alternate bathrrom. Very nice of them and hardly ever thought of by a lot of other restaurants. 

Great place for a date, as it is quite quiet. Great for families as well. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I actually came in here looking for Green Tea Lounge, and as it turned out the two restaurants shared the same space and I sat at the wrong one. No matter though, I have always been a fan of sushi regardless. Boyfriend and I ordered the sushi & sashimi platter with 2. We had excellent service from the lady working there. In addition to making sure we knew where all the fish we ordered came from, she even pulled out my chair for me when I came in! The service was so good though I felt slightly uncomfortable simply because I'm not used to being doted on like that, but still a positive regardless!

However I was slightly disappointed with  the quality of sushi. The sashimi was amazing, and it should be since they came fresh from pretty much all over the globe. However I was disappointed with the nigiri sushi because the rice wasn't pressed quite right in my opinion since every time we picked up the sushi the rice would crumble and fall apart. For the price I'm paying I would have expected sushi that didn't fall apart. Overall though, this is a nice place for sushi, but will unlikely be my go to place."}
{"text":"the location is quite hidden, you will have to be in the J-town complex and see a small sign.

the decor doesn't give you the looks of a Japanese restaurant.

the menu only has 2 pages, but their special of the day and a special menu has a total of 4 pages.

the waitress let us know that the special fish they have of the day is O-toro.

wanted to try out how their basic fish selection, we ordered an Ume Chirashi and Sakura Chirashi. yes, both Chirashi on the menu, I wanted to see what the $6 difference is all about.

(look at the pictures)
can you really tell the difference between the Ume and Sakura Chirashi? after going through all the seafood, $6 got me a bit more rice, and 1, yes ONE scallop. 

beside the scallop, not more fish, both has the same amount of fish, and the same amount of egg, same type and same cut of fish.

with charging at such price, they didn't use fresh wasabi, they are just giving me the regular wasabi paste.

the salad that came first, was just 3 slices of cucumber, and a bunch of iceberg lettuce, with a possibly sesame seed sauce? but the colour of it is just dull.

forgot to mention, the lotus roots and the eggs are way to sweet, making the Chirashi more like a dessert.

so I guess give it 3 months to get it pricing right, and hopefully they find the balance. (and hope they don't go out of business...)"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and I wasn't impressed. 

I ordered the Ume Chirashi and my bf ordered the tempura platter. The waitress didn't seem to know what she was really doing. She asked us if we wanted soup and salad. Both of us said yes and she came back with one soup and one salad. I really don't care for either. 

Our food arrived on the slow side since there was only 4 tables, two tables were already served their food and the other table came after ours. My bf's tempura platter came minus the bowl of rice but she politely asked if he wanted a bowl. I tried one of the veggies from his platter and it happens to be an onion with a toothpick and it really wasn't that great. For the price we were paying I expected the more traditional Japanese style tempura but instead we got the Korean style tempura. I've had better tempura at places where they offer $6.95 tempura bento lunch. 

My bf finished his whole entire tempura platter and rice before my Chirashi arrived. I was a little disappointed because there's clearly a timing issue here. When my Chirashi arrived it looked like a painting and it was so colorful. They offered a variety of fish and it was fresh tasting. It was on the small side and I felt hungry after about a hour. 

Overall I am a bit disappointed because this place didn't live up to the prices they were charging and their timing issue is a problem especially for lunch. Hopefully they will work out the kinks in the next few months."}
{"text":"Mifune Japanese Cuisine is not bad but I doubt it will ever be my to go to restaurant if I have craving for sushi or sashimi.

On a Saturday night, this place was sadly so empty. 2 tables including us, I really wondering how they stay in business!

My Ume Chirashi ($16) and Uni Nigiri ($8.85) were both OK. The fish was not amazing fresh but I did enjoy the uni but it was not cheap!! The shari rice was a little off but I think it is just personal preference.

Service thought is really attentive and polite."}
{"text":"This is not a bad place for dinner or lunch. They are allowed you to enjoy your meal and not rushing you out the door like the other place that I have tried it.

For the food that we have tonight sashimi and Sushi Is quite fresh. So far does have  become my favours place for Japanese food but I will give you guys posted this is my first time at this place."}
{"text":"Akemashite ometedou gozaimasu. 

Did you know that Japanese people normally celebrate December 31st by eating noodles to have good luck for the next year? I didn't, but I was craving some noodles and Niwatei was closed when I got there. 

This time I ate tempura soba. The noodles were good and the soup was just a right. However, the tempura wasn't cooked as well. I suspect the oil wasn't hot enough and the batter soaked up more oil and the tail wasn't crispy enough to eat. I just dipped it in the soup to let it pull some of the oils away. 

Following that I had a sushi tray which consisted of tamago, salmon roe, Vancouver salmon, two pieces of tuna, a few maki, and squid. 

The only temperature and feel of the sushi was better than the last time I was there. That's why I improved the rating. I also liked the fact that they asked me if I wanted wasabi inside my sushi which I don't want normally want. 

The single sushi chef was quite busy,  but the waitress was very knowledgeable and gave me tidbits of trivia to pass the time making the experience more fun. So I didn't ding any points for the communication with the chef. At least he greeted me happy new year as I was leaving. 


Overall the experience is better than the last time I was there, even the salad is better.  However, I still don't like the style for the omakase, I am just used to sola sushi ya style I guess. Where having it not really known and having the staff ask you what you like and don't like is part of the fun. 

Price wise it is up there with Solo Sushi Ya which is why I compare these two closely."}
