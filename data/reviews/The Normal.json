{"text":"Went there with a few people and it seemed like a good choice. Two of the people in my party ordered chicken and waffles and I ordered the crispy spiced chicken breast sandwich. The plates looked great but both chicken and waffle dishes were raw. Really disgusting. The chicken sandwich was undercooked as well. Never going back there. The server was very understanding about it all. The manager on the other hand didn't seem to sincerely care at all. Really too bad. I cannot recommend this establishment at all. Raw chicken doesn't deserve any stars."}
{"text":"The place was nice from the outside and fairly new to Tempe. It used to be an old IHOP and boy does it have a new vibrant look and feel to it. Nice decor and I also enjoyed the music. The waitstaff was a bit inattentive though. The waitress also got my order wrong. I wanted to order the Bison burger but ordered the Graduate burger w/ spicy hatch chili, smoked mozzarella, and citrus mayo. It came plain as day with none of the toppings I ordered. My meal was rectified by bringing me my fixings on the sides. Once I, myself, put together the burger it was delicious. Good food. Just not amazing food. I would come here again."}
{"text":"My meal (Burger) was good, but my wife's short rib hash thing was inedible. The dish lacked flavor and the potatoes in it were still raw and crunchy. We didn't see our server for about 15 minutes after she served it, so by the time she came back we were over our experience and just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"Food tasted good.  Still can't figure out if There waseven egg on the burrito....it may have been cooked with the chorizo?  Service was very slow from greeting at the door to waiting 12 plus min for our tab and box. Getting refills was difficult and listening wasn't our servers best skill.   No sense of urgency nor was any management present.  It felt much like a bunch of kids left to figure out the service aspect."}
{"text":"I have lived in Tempe for years now and have not found a breakfast place as good as the Normal Diner. I usually don't like breakfast food and never know what to order. I am obsessed with bacon but my boyfriend can't eat it. We had a super knowledgable and amazing server named Madi. She recommended that my boyfriend could get turkey sausage and I could get a flight of bacon on a separate plate so we could both get what we wanted! She also recommended the Redeemer, which was probably the best bloody mary I've ever had. I wasn't a fan of the potatoes because they were much more spicy and seasoned than what I'm used to.

Overall, amazing experience and incredible staff! Me and my boyfriend will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Normal Diner is amazing!!!  We were greeted kindly and seated promptly!  Our server Britni was informative and fun to chat with.  The Green Bowl, Blueberry pancakes, and Quinoa and Kale Salad were all delicious!  The coffee is wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"Solid new spot in Tempe - I would definitely come back for brunch. The Redeemer bloody mary is incredible with a cheeseburger slider on top! And the chef is the same at Tapacubo which had awesome drinks and small plates"}
{"text":"A fun vibe and pretty decent food, I definitely love the look of the place. It usually is pretty busy, which is encouraging. It definitely will be in my monthly breakfast rotation!"}
{"text":"Just went last night.  What a cool spot!  The food was very good!  Wanted to steal my son's chicken and red velvet waffles!  So good!  

Service was attentive and accurate and really, what more could you want?

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Pretty cool vibe. Was not busy and our food came out almost immediately. I ordered the Farmer Omelette and asked for peppers instead of squash.  What was weird though was that the omelette didn't taste like anything at all - super bland. I was very surprised that both my omelette and roasted potatoes were completely covered in onions. There is no mention of onions on the menu or else I would have ordered something different... Usually I can just take something off but this wasn't the case for this meal unfortunately. I get brunch every weekend and have never been anywhere where the potatoes are covered in onions so not sure why that's a thing here.

My boyfriend ordered the Gringo Burrito and he said it was also super bland.  We didn't order drinks because they were pretty pricey."}
{"text":"The Normal is my GO TO place whenever I want a great breakfast or brunch, excellent service, and a friendly atmosphere.  My favorite is the Hash - they customize it a little for me with eggs over easy, a little bit less spicy on the sauce, and substitute Sourdough bread for the Tortilla.  Just fantastic !!  I've tried the Hash at a few other places, and just not nearly as good, as The Normal has excellent potatoes, delicious meat, and a rich and spicy flavor.  Wow !!!  So lovely today seeing my favorite waitress - Amy.  I usually go with my wife and kids and she always, always takes great care of us.  Just so friendly and welcoming.  On occasion it can get very busy there - it is right across the street from ASU.  So you just have to decide if you're willing to be patient to get excellent food, and chill a bit.  If you're super busy yourself or in a rush, going at a super busy time may be the wrong thing to do, as they concentrate on great food, and not rushing you in and out.  Thanks Amy for another great morning, and thanks Normal for doing what you do..."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! I had to share this awesomeness that I had this week. The Normal Diner has great specials, I had The Barbecue Mushroom burger with Bacon for the lunch special. Would definitely try The Normal. You have to get The Blackboard special"}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite!  
I had the Chicken & Waffles & the Bison Burger with Hatch Chilis, and a fried egg.  The ingredients are free range, natural, fresh, and HIGH quality. 
The server was amazing and made us feel like one of the family.  
We will be back again, and again."}
{"text":"First impression was how clean it was as as we walked in the door. Even the restrooms were beautifully clean. Next was the food!  we ordered the California burger. It was very tasty and had real avocado (no frozen goo)! My husband said his meat was more flavorful than a steak he'd had the nought before at an upscale place. Very impressed we will be back!"}
{"text":"As others have said - Concept is great, but execution was poor. 

We arrived about 1pm and couldn't find any parking (maybe because the hotel was full?). Finally found parking on the street after 15 minutes. It would be nice if there was some reserved parking for the restaurant.

Food was good, but seemed over priced for the diner atmosphere. I had the Green Bowl and my friends had pancakes for $10 a piece. (It's just $5.50 at NCounter on Mill Ave for pancakes)

Server was nice, but the service was painfully slow considering there were only a handful of other tables.

It was also freezing in there even though it was 110 degrees outside."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Seldom do I find a diner with a menu so simple yet unique. Fresh!"}
{"text":"Came here after visiting a friend's art show in the area. Aside from the charming decor, the highlight of this place for me would be the staff affability. The hostess, waiter, and even our cook were all incredibly nice. They were good with menu recommendations, casual conversation, and even personalized my sister's soup with a cute smiley face. She got what was on the blackboard, which I think was a barbecue brisket sandwich. It was a very good sandwich! I nibbled off her plate and wished it was mine. I had gotten the cheese curds since I wasn't hungry enough for my own full meal, and my partner got a chicken cobb salad. All three of us were satisfied with our meals.

For a frame of reference, last time I was there, prices were around the $8-$12 mark depending on what you want. They also offer donuts and such for snacks. 

Good experience!"}
{"text":"Great turkey Avocado with bacon. I enjoyed the dressing of the wedge salad, especially when dipping the fries in! There is a very nice ambiance and decor inside The Normal. I enjoyed the the eclectic style of music and the lighting fixtures. 

Clean establishment with comfortable seating. Plays to ASU's historic roots and erases the forgettable memory of iHop! Paul is a great server with a low key, hospitable attitude. Quirky, book at checkout was humorous!"}
{"text":"While the Graduate Hotel it is attached to is FANTASTIC and close to the ASU campus, the restaurant is only so-so food wise, and we had terrible service.  My husband and I had breakfast outside on Saturday morning.  While the food was good, it took almost a half hour to come out (and there were only 8 other tables), and people waiting at the inside coffee bar were leaving, it was taking so long to get a coffee to go.  What you really need to know if you eat here, is DON'T sit in the section waitressed by Madilyn J.    Talk about horrible, horrible, service!  We were seated in her section and given menus, and she finally ventured to our table about 15 minutes later, just as we were standing to leave.  Once the food arrived, we never saw her again and had to flag another waitress to get our check.  When Madilyn finally brought the check, she just dropped it on the table, without a word, and turned to walk away.  We stopped her and asked if we could get more coffee and her response was, \"Oh, OK.... I'll be back\".  We sat there 10 more minutes, and of course she didn't come back, and then we just left after taking the check and money inside.  You would think that being that close to a college there would be 1,000 people looking for her job.  Maybe management should give someone else a try!"}
{"text":"Best place in town for a bloody.  Always looking for someone who can replicate a good midwestern bloody mary, and this is definitely the place!  Always helps when the service is exceptional, makes the whole experience more memorable and exactly the reason I am a returning customer.  This place is exactly what Tempe needed."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The minimum wage breakfast, chicken and waffles, and breakfast hash are all to die for. I cannot give it five stars because the service is consistently terrible and the decor is hideous. If you can get past young inexperienced servers who have no problem seating you at a dirty table, you will be rewarded with delicious, unique eats!"}
{"text":"The chicken and red velvet waffles are amazing! My hostess named Britni was amazing! Very polite and showed excellent customer service. As a home trained chef on Masterchef Season 4 show, this is by far culinary influenced."}
{"text":"Went here for two meals while staying at the hotel with friends, in hindsight we probably should've eaten here every time because we had less luck on Mill. For breakfast, the acai bowl is super healthy and the fruit/granola toppings made it a great way to start the day. The place is like a diner on one side (Old IHOP- but with cocktails) and a coffee & pressed juice bar/cafe on the other side. Bison burger is the best I've ever had anywhere- just the perfect hatch chili spice to it.

Impressive spot, you'll like."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I've been there many times now and it is always delicious!! Try the homemade guacamole the fresh chips and salsa and tomatillo sauce!!!"}
{"text":"At the behest of my waitress, \"Mystique\", the fairest lady this side of the Mississippi and quite possibly all of the world, I have become a yelper. The Normal Diner is quite a fine establishment. In fact, of the three nights I spent in Tempe, I ate four meals there. It may have been because it was attached to my hotel, but I don't think so. Compared to anywhere else I ate in AZ, this was by far the best. Good atmosphere, good breakfast, and most importantly, great bloody's. The gringo burrito was my favorite. I put it at four stars for now, but willing to consider moving it up to five. That is, if \"Mystique\" considers visiting me, a stranger, in the \"boring\" part of Oregon. Then, and only then, shall it be \"as good as it gets.\""}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere deserve five stars. We're locals and have been here three times so far. Each time, same disinterested service and just an overall feeling of disorganization. I look forward to the iced coffee (nice & strong) and the green chili omelette is amazing. My other half tends to get the crispy chicken sandwich which is also very good. I hope management takes notice to this and a few of the other reviews to iron out some kinks in the process/workflow."}
{"text":"The food was very good, besides the fact the potatoes were served cold. Both the blackboard breakfast burger and gringo burrito were enjoyable, and reasonably priced. The ambiance was cozy and unique, although it was a bit loud. Overall it's a great place to have a nice brunch with the family."}
{"text":"Decor is amazing.  Food was just average. I got the grilled cheese with BBQ brisket, good concept, but entirely too much bread and a little boring flavor wise.  My best friend had the burger recommend by our server.  The burger had no flavor.  We could have made better food at home especially for the price of our entrees.  I was disappointed because I really wanted to like this place, but don't know if I would go back or recommend."}
{"text":"The brisket hash is the reason I came back.  They ran out one time and it broke my heart."}
{"text":"Haley was our server. She was extremely attentive and watch the table. The food was good. We started with the cheese curds. They were good, but oily. For dinner we ordered the chicken and waffles and the breakfast sandwich. Both were good. My only issue with the menu is that it is extremely limited. The place could have a dinner menu for when events are going on at Gammage.

Maybe a blue plate special or call it a devil plate."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles blew our minds. Ambience is nice,  came on a Sunday morning and we're able to sit right down. Staff was fun. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"The Normal Diner makes 'normal' exquisite. Features homely, simple meals, cooked to perfection, and presented beautifully. It may just be eggs and potatoes, but it is one of the best variations of eggs and potatoes you can find,  A.K.A. 'The Minimum Wage' breakfast.

Two flawless eggs over easy, crispy potatoes with herbs, spices, and sauteed poblanos add a small kick. Topped off with thick bacon, and toast of your choice. Portions are just right, even for an American restaurant. At first glance it seemed small but by the end of the meal I was left full with little on my plate. My roommate whom I dined with ate a dish with braised beef short rib, that was extremely tender. He even compared it to his mothers own cooking!

The atmosphere and staff made the experience that more pleasant. The restuarants dress is spacious, retro, impeccably clean, and feels like a hodge-podge of decades past, featuring a wall decorated with 8 tracks, and leaving checks attached to dated paperback novels. All of the staff was amiable, and I had a few conversations with some of the waiters. The two waiters I chatted with were ASU students along with the majority of the staff that also appeared rather young. It makes me feel good, knowing I can leave a nice tip, for a waiter who absolutely deserved it, but for a waiter who is also a student. I am currently a graduate student at ASU, and it wasn't that long ago that I remember living off tips from strangers. It pleases me to see Normal Diner employing students, I remember the nightmare of an ihop that preceded Normal Diner. Not only was it bad for an ihop, but their staff was rather crotchety and old, certainly not employing Tempe's younger work force. 

Normal Diner, is far from 'normal'. I plan on returning frequently, next time I'll have to try their espresso!

UPDATE: Their espresso is delicious and comes from a big beautiful pink espresso machine"}
{"text":"Great friendly service.  Really nice menu and no one disappointed with their choices.  Special Mother's Day specials very nice.  Wish I lived closer so I could go more often."}
{"text":"Not sure how the food was (2 hours and no food ever came .. had to leave to make it to a show). Service tried, but no point if food never shows up. The Gammage and ASU athletic schedules are public so not absurd to expect local food joints to be prepared."}
{"text":"Place is the bomb dignity, I highly recommend the after school special!!!! I love it!!!"}
{"text":"Paid 15 dollars for a burger and fries. Burger was clearly frozen and reheated, as it was in a perfect, hockey puck shaped disk. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Retro, quirky atmosphere. Fun ambiance. Recommend the Rueben sandwich & cereal killer milkshake for anyone with a sweet tooth. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I feel like since the restaurant is part of a hotel many students at ASU are scared to try it out thinking they will have a hefty bill after a meal, but really the prices are perfect for what they serve. 

TryTry out their beef brisket sandwich and tomato soup it is absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I am really sad to write a bad review for this place but I have to...I'll make it sweet and simple. 

- They brought my Fat Hen Sandwhich without the potatoes saying they ran out... even though my boyfriends burrito was filled with them. No big deal but the toast they offered in it replacement was not  equal in value.

- The Fat Hen was dry... Really dry. 

- Cockroach...Yes there was a cock roach walking behind me on the wall. I literally jumped up out of my seat and to stand and eat my food for a good 5 minutes before anyone who worked there did anything about it. The fact they were so NONCHALANT about it, is what gets me.... Health code violation, anyone????

I really wanted to like this place because of the vibe it has and the concept but no....Very low standard for service and quality of.. everything.... I will never return. 

(I was told this property used to be a Denny's before it became The Normal...I would rather eat at Denny's before coming back.)"}
{"text":"What an awesome place!  Crazy menu that just works and is super tasty. You should see what their Bloody Mary's look like!  It's a meal and a drink all in one. If you order the French toast, make sure you can stomach all the sweets they put into it. I'll certainly be going back here!"}
{"text":"We went at 1am the other night and it was pretty cool. They had a great selection. I had the chicken sandwich and I gotta say It was really good! The bun was perfect. My bro had the bison burger and he said he was amazing. A nice little find in Tempe."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast after reading about them on yelp here and it was okay. The food was alright, but for the price and the amount of the serving, it would be below average. Their coffee though is strong, I had a cup and a half and really can feel its affect for a few hours and I am a caffeine machine.  I like their 70s decor which is one of my favorite, very comfortable and hip sort of.
As for the food I ordered the fat hen sandwich(seems like one of their signature dish) which comes with a tiny amount of potatoes. The sandwich itself isn't all that big to be called the fat hen, maybe medium hen. The beef was similar to pulled pork or shredded beef and is alright, similar to a bbq sandwich but nothing special beside  an egg on it. I wish they used a harder bread, with the hawaiian bun, the sauce is already so sweet, the bread did not need to be sweet and it breaks apart with the sauce in the meat . They should use maybe a toasted ciabatta or sourdough roll. Also there need to be a little more heat in the sauce or sourness which would really elevate the taste buds make it more complex sauce then just sweet. The potatoes were alright but there was not much of it. The whole thing with coffee will run 15.50 so that is a big price tag for what you get. I get the whole fine foods thing, but the food was not that fine so I would expect more generous portions. Again the coffee is really fine and strong though."}
{"text":"Really good simple food. 
Staff is nice and friendly. Would have liked to have known that the special turkey club I ordered had a fried egg on it, but knowing that I don't think I would have ordered it, but it was really really good."}
{"text":"Bland and cold food, waitresses who gape and gawk at the tables but make no move to actually engage the customers, 20 minutes to get a drink order, another 35 to get cold food, 10 to pick up the bill. You know you have a dysfunctional staff when the manager is busting her ass to assist customers but the bleach blonde staff cannot be bothered to lift a finger.

I'm sad - this place looked so cute and so promising. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I agree with Mary, I think 3.5 is about right.  That being said, your experience  at the Normal will directly correlate to who your server is. We ate here 4 times in three days. Most times we had a very attentive server and good timely service.  Once, our server was being a little too attentive so some tables and not others. The staff tends to conduct what should be invisible behind the scenes business out in the dining room. I've worked in restaurants, the patrons don't really want to hear about who's up, who's slow, or where a server should be. 

The food was good overall maybe less of a value than a breakfast chain.  I really enjoyed the Waffle sandwich and my wife said her omelettes were very good but the scrambled eggs less so. High marks to the barista making our Americanos!"}
{"text":"I arrived to The Normal Diner in a hangry state of mind. I really had wanted to order the chicken and waffles, they are so delicious looking in all the Instagram posts, but wasn't optimistic that it would bring me out of being hangry. I went for it and was not disappointed, in fact I would go back to Tempe just for that meal. The waffles fluffy, the chicken was a tiny big spicy and the butter and syrup were just all the perfect blend. The meal was devoured and I was oh so satisfied. Thank you Normal Dinar!"}
{"text":"I quite like the normal diner, actually. I had pretty low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised. The food is good and relatively inexpensive, the service is good and the coffee refills kept coming. I can't say enough how much I love that about a breakfast place. Anyway, the first time I went I had the hash and it was a little greasy for me but not bad, the second time I had the biscuits and gravy which are HUGE and could easily be split with anyone. What I like about the normal diner is that it's never too busy (at least when I go) and it's easy to be seated right away."}
{"text":"Used to go to IHOP here, saw this place and decided to try it when my sister said she wanted chicken and waffles. Goddamned amazing chicken and waffles. I had the French bread, also incredible. Good looking place, not crowded. Clean and friendly. New favorite diner IMO. Menu is an eclectic take on classic diner fare."}
{"text":"Best chicken n waffles hands down. Also their mimosas are on point. Love this place. Whether I'm using postmates or pick up or going in for a mimosa and some breakfast. Very underrated"}
{"text":"Really wish I could rate this 5 stars.  Cute concept but execution lacking.  Service was excellent.  

Dined here the other night before a meeting.  First strike is the very poor wine list.  The server said the restaurant doesn't want to compete with the bar? Um what?  I'm having dinner and would like a decent choice of wine. Only one white? A Chardonnay?   YUCK.  At least offer a Pinot Grigio or a Sauvignon Blanc too. 

On to the food.  Two of us ordered meatloaf and the other the special.  The meatloaf was entirely to spicy and I like it hot. Not sure how a normal diner would eat this meal.  The zucchini side was entirely forgettable. 

I would like to come back and try breakfast.  I'm not sure I would come back for dinner.  Honestly would probably rather eat at the bar with a full bar menu if the food is just meh."}
{"text":"The place was pretty 50's.70's retro look, along with a cool little coffee bar and receipt tray aka a book. The service was pretty prompt and they were friendly. The only downside is the food and I rank that over service, unfortunately. I had the Afterschool special and it was really good: toasted sourdough bread, bbq brisket, tomato soup. However, the beef was SUPER SALTY. I had a hard time finishing it and could only do it with drinking a lot of water. If I could tell the cook one thing, please lay off the salt. 

It seems this place is new (less than 2 years, I assume), and so I also expect the staff to more or less make a mistake more often than other business that have been around for at least 5 years. I may eat here more often to update this review since I live by ASU. Hopefully, the quality picks up."}
{"text":"Yo fuck this place.

I ordered their gringo burrito because it sounded good (as does all of their menu items).  When I got it, it was puny AF, cold in the middle, and the wrapper stuck to the burrito, so when I opened it, it all fell out. When I said something, my waiter offered me a cookie or a muffin...

This place is overpriced and overrated. It should've never taken over IHOP."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and I really like the vibe of the old style diner but new and modern.
I live down the street and had a friend in town from SF, so we decided to bike down here for an early bloody mary. Upon receiving this beautiful drink we decided to pass on breakfast, thank goodness because I was satisfied after the slider. The server told us the portions were generous too. 
I really like the idea of this bloody mary but I do have to say that I wish the drink was better. There was soooo much horse raddish and it was kind of thin. The slider meat was delish but the bun was really cold. 
Over all, I would come back and try again!"}
{"text":"I hate restaurants that are ALL SHOW. So they've recreated 50's diner style in a hip modern decor. SO FU**ING WHAT???!!! Ordered two of their house specialties for me and my dinner guest. Although we were among only 6 customers in the place, we waited for an HOUR and it still never came out of the kitchen. We just got up and left while their hapless young wait staff said how sorry they were! Will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Stayed at the graduate hotel and decided to pop into the normal diner based on the reviews and the cool look. Well, all I can say is I was not disappointed. They just started a Bloody Mary bar and it was fantastic! I ordered cheese curds and those are amazing too! Waiting on my breakfast to arrive but needless to say super excited would totally recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"BLOODY MARY is to die for......I already can't wait to go back and have another!!!"}
{"text":"Gross. Moldy bread and dirty celery. My hubs and I popped in for brunch today before catching the matinee showing of Hamilton. Service was prompt, we were seated quickly, but I was surprised to see a shortened menu in contrast to what I had seen online. We each ordered a bloody mary to start, not the over-the-top one that's in so many other Yelp reviews (that one wasn't on our abbreviated menu), but just your standard, average bloody. This would have been fine had it not contained a dirty celery stalk. Whatever, I took it out, laid it on the table, and crossed my my fingers that the vodka would kill off any potential hazards. Plus, we were in a hurry. Hamilton, remember? The hubs ordered the minimum wage breakfast, which was just about as average as our bloodys (minus the dirt). I was a little fancier in ordering avocado toast, which looked like it would have been okay, but was served on moldy bread. Like moldy baguette. Someone in the kitchen picked up the moldy loaf, saw it was moldy, and still sliced it open, smeared some avo spread on that ish, and served it up. Not cool. I flagged down our sweet server, showed her the mold, and went ahead and mentioned the dirty celery, too. She felt terrible and had the manager comp our meals, offered to bring something else, but I just wasn't feeling like taking the risk of being served more dumpster-bound food. We paid for our bloody marys (because she couldn't \"give away free alcohol\") and headed down the street to grab a sammich from Jimmy John's before the show. While a convenient spot to grab a bite before a show at Gammage, we won't be returning to Normal Diner."}
{"text":"Delicious, way better than my expectations for a diner. My family had the BBQ brisket sandwich, hash, pancakes,  chicken and red velvet waffles, and the French toast. Everything was wonderful, including the atmosphere and the service. We are visiting the area and staying in the graduate hotel, but I'm honestly sad that I can't pack this place up to go.  You should definitely try it! !"}
{"text":"We paid 40 bucks and left hungry. The Benedict was a measly 2 eggs with chorizo and muffin, with no side. 10.50. Ordered a side of potatoes for 4 bucks. 
Service was good, but the Benedict was way overpriced for what we ended up with. 
This place is more about the looks than the food. Maybe their lunch items are better. Not willing to waste another 40 bucks to see, though."}
{"text":"Okay. Anyone who knows me knows that I love -- LOVE -- chicken and waffles. Anyone who knows me will also know that I'm a sucker for red velvet sweets.

Clearly, The Normal is psychic and knew what I wanted before I even stepped foot into this diner.

Wait, let's back up. I'm clearly too excited.

The Normal is located adjacent to The Graduate Hotel, and it comes with all of the retro decor goodness that The Graduate has. Three of us stepped in for breakfast before heading to a conference on campus, and I honestly wasn't expecting much. I thought it would be typical diner food.

I was so wrong.

As soon as I laid my eyes on the chicken and red velvet waffles option on the menu, I was sold. (I may have also had a sliiiight hangover and was desperate for starch. But I always want carbs, so nothing new there.) When my precious chicken and waffles came, I definitely did not expect a portion of that size. I expected maybe two pieces of chicken and a waffle or two to go with it. But oh no. The Normal gives non-normal portions and decided to give me three meaty chicken pieces and four waffles. Everything was absolutely perfect -- savory, crispy, and juicy chicken paired with sweet waffles. I stuffed what I could into my stomach and took the rest to-go.

I have absolutely no regrets."}
{"text":"If this restaurant has more than 5 people at a time they don't know what to do! If there's a big group here, just forget it. I went to have lunch and there wasn't a big lunch crowd however there was a large group in the back. I sat and waited to order and no one took my order for 15 minutes and they didn't even notice me. I had to wave down someone (not my waitress) and she added my order to someone else's table! So my food took another 30 mins and they didn't know where to deliver the food so again I had to wave someone down to get my burger. Then! The freakin burger was burnt to a crisp ( I ordered median well). I gave back my food and asked for my check. Thankfully they took off the charge and I left there as quick as I could. Don't ever eat here!"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere, greeted warmly but the food was not great. We dined at 10 am on a Saturday. It was not busy at all. We ordered the breakfast burger (which in fact does have a burger patty on it though not listed as such-like the rest of the burger options-only listed bacon.  the waiter did not ask me how I wanted the burger cooked, also presuming there was no meat patty). A bison burger, cooked to order. The red pepper onion daily special  quiche with fruit on the side. A single blue berry pancake. The breakfast burger was dry from the biscuit and meat to the skimpy addition of gravy, the egg was cooked firm also providing no added sauce, and in all quite bland in flavor. The breakfast potatoes are very spicy. The bison burger was spicy, cooked to order, but the bun was too sweet. The side of fries and ranch were amazingly tasty and picked over by the whole table! The quiche listed as the daily special was not what was brought to the table and took the waiter two trips to the cook to verify what was served. Ultimately that dish was removed from the ticket. The blue berry pancake was devoured by my son with out complaint. They tried very hard to make the order issue right by offering complimentary food but we declined based on our schedule restraints. Our waiter seemed tired, lost, distracted....the manager and door staff was very nice. Likely not to return, there are closer and better diners near me."}
{"text":"This is our second visit here for breakfast. The menu is small, but everything on it is done to perfection and absolutely delicious. Service is friendly and fast, and that bottomless cup of coffee is tasty. This will become one of our regular haunts for sure!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Amy was fantastic. I had the Minimum Wage meal with a massive side of avocado and tomato juice. I've been eating here for the past several months.  The food is good and the service is exceptional.  I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Came to grab a quick breakfast my last day staying at The Graduate Hotel. Upon entering, it was clear that the skeleton crew was overwhelmed by the couple of tables present. There seemed to literally be two people working the whole restaurant, including the coffee counter, kitchen, and dining room, at breakfast, on a weekend! Instead of dining in, I ended up grabbing a smoothie. The Purple Haze (closest thing to the acai parfait I'd originally planned on) was icy and flavorless. The discount for staying at the hotel was wasted, as I ended up tossing it out a few sips in."}
{"text":"Well we are back in town and are the first two in on Sunday morning. Well we decided to order the brisket. Mmmm not what I expected and I mentioned that. It was bbq sauce brisket.. wow! Not expected THAT for breakfast. So my 5star went to 3 star. They need to change the description of this item. We would both have been happier with Anything else. And the boy always eats everything !!  We mentioned that fact and she did give us a 10% discount. Ok fine. So not sure if we will be back ..."}
{"text":"This place is adorable. They have a full dinning area, a typical diner bar, and a coffee shop area. They also make their own donuts. That's kind of where the stellar review stops. Had a typical two egg breakfast with potatoes and a mimosa. My friend had the same. I also ordered the red velvet waffle. Which lacked in flavor. I ordered a mimosa, which was really strong, no complaints here it was $7! And my friend ordered an extra spicy Bloody Mary. Our waitress was nice and the bathrooms were clean. For the price it was lack luster. I can eat this exact meal for half the price down the street."}
{"text":"Very good food and cool vibe. I had one of the burgers. Rich flavor, not too heavy, but definitely filling. If you're looking for something fun and authentic, check this place out for sure. I will be going back."}
{"text":"My only gripe is lemon in the hollandaise, and no chorizo. Boo... everything else was awesome, like a Dennys-late night, but way more fun. Midnight breakfast."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. Velvet chicken and waffles are great, server was awesome, and it's a cool, yet relaxing environment."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, which is why this is getting 5 stars. However this is a breakfast place, and it needs to be prompt service..... the service was so slow even though it wasn't crowded. The food was served cold.  Luckily the food is cooked so well and is so delicious that we still enjoyed our meal. 
This place isn't hipster but it's like a quirky diner. 
Good for groups."}
{"text":"The server was friendly and prompt.   Ordered the cheddar biscuits and gravey.  Unfortunately,  the biscuit wHill looking light and fluffy were a tad bit stale and the gravey was rather bland.  On the bright side the two sausages were good.

Son had the hotdog and it was as expected,  he liked the chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Came here with my friend and I had an amazing burger! Nice and juicy not overcooked at all, perfectly done. The garlic french fries were delicious as well, and my friend enjoyed her minimum wage meal too, though she did comment that the eggs were a bit too spicy for her liking. Overall an excellent meal! :) Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Swanky updated/modern diner. Good food, great service. My wife and I have shared a meal here on both visits for breakfast. Very cute and worth a visit if you are in town or looking for a more unique breakfast check out this little gem!"}
{"text":"This place gets five stars for a fun throw back diner vibe. Very hipster. Where the wheels fell off was the service and frankly the food.  Hard to screw up bacon and eggs, but they did. With that being said, I would come back based upon reviews from others. I know what I am getting if I come back. Grilled cheese Braised short ribs on toast with tomato soup. Looked amazing."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice people. Had a buffalo chicken sandwich (special), and the chicken breast was about 2 inches thick and served on the tiniest (albiet delicious) bun. It was impossible to eat, and the flavor was ok but not memorable at all. Sweet potato fries were delicious, homemade pickles were just ok. My friend had the wedge salad, and it was just terrible. Flavorless, just not good. Onions that looked pickled but weren't, overall badly dressed. We did enjoy a delicious donut afterwards and have it on good authority that the breakfast is much better. 

I should have had breakfast. I probably won't be going back. Menu is too small, essentially no vegetarian options. My bf is gluten-free and there's no way we could eat here."}
{"text":"First time here, the decor is nice, but the service left much to be desired. Our server seemed less than thrilled to be there, and basically had no personality.  The food was a bit overpriced for breakfast.  The breakfast came with 2 eggs, potatoes and toast, but only 1 slice, for 8.25  The potatoes were spicy, cubed potatoes with poblano peppers.  I asked for jelly for my 1 slice of toast and what came out was a delicious real berry jam of sorts, it was very good.

They have a coffee and pastry area too for walk up and take out."}
{"text":"The diner itself is beautiful. A+ job on the decor.

there was barely anyone there when my parents and I came in to eat. We were seated and the server was very friendly. A bit too friendly. It's fine to ask how a customer is doing, but it border lines being annoying if you ask them more than 4 times. Wait time for the food took 25 minutes and made my parents both cranky.

love the menu. Love the concepts. Execution was questionable. I had the spiced chicken sandwich and it was very filling. A bit big to bite into for a petite girl like me. That wouldn't be a problem but my father also faced the same situation with his sandwich, so he decided on using his fork and knife to cut it into pieces. Homemade buns were delicious but my fathers broke apart as if it was a day or two old. French fries were delicious. Price appropriate with the meals. 

The food looked good and tasted alright. borderline sub par because of the expectation from the other reviews."}
{"text":"Tried the Gringo Burrito & a side of plain potatoes and it was good, not greasy at all. But the Guava Mimosa's are fantastic! A must try next time I am going to try their signature Bloody Mary, the real thing looks just as amazing as the picture, definitely a meal in it self! Oh and our waitress Rosa was awesome!"}
{"text":"Want to like it but have eaten here three times and food not good on three separate trips. We always stay at hotel and like many eateries associated with hotel, food is not great. Too many good places around here to get stuck at the Diner."}
{"text":"This is a great find, attached to The Graduate Hotel, best fried chicken and waffles ever; the chicken is all boneless and very tasty and the waffles are red velvet, big plate too"}
{"text":"If you are short handed, you should hire more staff, right? Came here by myself at around 8am, and was basically forgotten about. Every \"I'll be back in one second\" by the server turned into ten more minutes before being acknowledged. Food was decent, but the service makes me not want to come here. Unfortunately if you're staying at the hotel without a car, it's the only thing walking distance so you're shit outta luck. Service staff, get your act together"}
{"text":"In love !

I love the decor of this diner . The booths are very comfortable. 

Service was great . The food was great . The Bloody Mary was great ! 

I had the Cobb salad and my husband had the eggs Benedict. He said it was the best he has had - and he has had many ! 

Can not wait to go back ! So many things to try and love ! This restaurant is a great addition to Tempe ."}
{"text":"The decor, staff and food all \"on fleek\". The breakfast biscuit is unreal and the red velvet waffle and chicken was dope. Must stop in."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast after reading about it on Trip Advisor.  
Had the Minimum Wage Meal and a Malted Waffle.

As others have written...........if you are not into onions or spice TELL THEM.  I asked for the hash browns crispy and they were good......the ones that weren't touching the spicy onion mix.  Which were very good according to my husband.
The waffle was very light and a great compliment to the egg dish.

Place is located right at the edge of the university and wasn't busy on a mid week morning.
I can only imagine that it would get pretty loud when full."}
{"text":"Anything but normal! I love their fun spin on food, red velvet waffles and fried cheese curds!! Yum! Lots of great things on the menu, normal foods too for you basic bs ;) I love the decor too, it matches the hotels cute and playful feel! And what more could you ask for with easy parking??"}
{"text":"I only ate one thing.  AND Iit was a special...but it is the kind of food you want to recreate at home! The Breakfast Special changes daily. This morning it was a grilled cheese sandwich uing hearty whole grain bread with provolone, a fried egg, tomatoe slices, substantial avocado wedges and a guajillo mayonaise. YES.  The potatoes were exceptional as well...nice spicy chilis and tomato yumminess mixed in. The diner is CLEAN, open, uniquely decorated with throw back yet modern feeling. Great service...we were offered a to go cup without requesting it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have always wanted to try out the Normal and when we did we were not satisfied with service. From our server I felt there was no true hospitality in her work ethic. Felt as a student hating her job. 
 We ordered chicken and waffles, and the farmers omelette and the time it took for us to get our food was outrageous! 
All in all the food was great I just wish the service could've matched up with the food."}
{"text":"The owner reached out and apologized for the experience I had and offered to buy me lunch (thanks!) so I'm updating my ranking from one star to three because of him.  I'll update my review again, after my next experience."}
{"text":"My friend from Mesa and I decided that this would be a good mid-point to meet for a leisurely Saturday brunch. The informal modern decor, the bright interior, and comfortable seating made for a good start for the brunch, and service was fast and friendly. I ordered The Hash and some coffee to go with it. The eggs were cooked exactly as I had ordered (over medium), the potatoes were well seasoned, but the meat itself was rather dry and flavorless. I hope this is just an off instance, but otherwise a simple tweak for flavor and moistness is in order. Overall it was a satisfactory experience and I would not mind trying this spot again for brunch or lunch next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So happy I found myself at this new diner! Food was amazing and the staff and management were extremely helpful and friendly. Their food is made from scratch and  also comes from local purveyors! They really made us feel like our business mattered... Can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu. Oh and PS if you don't get the \"Redeemer\" off the cocktail list you are seriously missing out. It's by far the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I had been here once before and the food was fantastic. This time, not so much. I had ordered the chicken and waffles and both the chicken and the waffle were burnt and the waffle was not hot. Our server, Haley, was more concerned with whether or not she should get her nose pierced than she was with being attentive to us. The service was poor and I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Normal imho has a lot of endearing qualities when it comes to brunch, good service, cozy decor, an inviting ambiance, and guava juice mimosa (like whoa!) but that's it. I think what saddens me is the menu, it's just underwhelming comprised mostly of breakfast sandwiches and not many traditional breakfast options and omelettes. I guess I'm accustomed to having a little more options than just food items limited to one page, heck isn't it a diner, so, shouldn't there be a little more choices?! Now, their Red Velvet waffles and chicken strips is outstanding, the chicken is hella moist, and the Red Velvet waffle isn't dry and together with butter and syrup and the accompaniment of a mimosa makes for a joyous brunch but I think that's it. I have had their braised short rib hash, and yes it was spicy but it was okay, nothing impressive that I must have again. The Normal is good, not great and only worth it if you're catching a show at the Gammage because they're across the street and convenient but alas that's it. If you do find yourself in the vicinity, get the chicken and waffles, it's yummy!"}
{"text":"I enjoy being here. The food is good, the atmosphere is great, and the service has improved.
I ordered coffee with milk on the side and my server, Sequoia, brought the cup of coffee out on a plate with a spoon, and small metal pitcher of milk on a napkin all arranged on the plate. A classy way to serve coffee. 
Thanks for improving Normal Diner, see you again soon."}
{"text":"The service is always poor. The credit card machine was down but the hostess failed to tell us. When we were waiting to put our names on the list the hostess sat at least four parties before even making eye contact with us. Too bad because the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here the last 2 days in a row for a work function (We were staying at The Graduate hotel). I ordered the minimum wage breakfast both days {eggs any style, bacon or sausage, potatoes, and toast}. It was good, not GREAT. It was pretty basic, but hey, I guess it suits its name! It definitely hit the spot and gave me fantastic brain power for a day full of meetings! 

The potatoes were little small squares and I usually like extra crispy, hearty taters so they weren't the best that i've ever had. I also tasted a green smoothie and it was SUPER icy, they may need to invest in a new blender to get their smoothies the right consistency. 

I didn't get a chance to try their famous Bloody Mary but it definitely looks like it warrants 5 stars (...with a hamburger coming out of it and all!). I will be back to try that, for sure! The service was great and for a group of 14, quick!"}
{"text":"The Normal diner near Gammage is my favorite breakfast place in Tempe. The 3 of us each ordered the minimum wage meal (eggs, potatoes, toast, & bacon or sausage). Then we shared an order of chocolate chip pancakes. It was too much food but we ate all of it except one of the 3 giant pancakes and it was all yummy! We keep promising ourselves that we'll try the chicken & waffles but then we always want the minimum wage meal and say \"Maybe next time\" to the chicken & waffles. The service was great and the diner wasn't very busy which is one of the features we enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm staying in Tempe for a work trip and I had enough time in between meetings today to eat lunch at the diner. I wasn't disappointed! This place is so cute and the food was great. I had a warm latte from their coffee bar and the Fit Meal. The avocados were perfectly ripe and the tomatoes were super juicy! Next time I'm back, I will definitely be making a trip here to try the red velvet milkshake!"}
{"text":"I've had breakfast three times here. I had the hash, eggs benedict and the minimum wage meal.  I enjoyed my meals particularly the hash and the eggs benedict.  I also tried a donut."}
{"text":"I would give this a 5 star review because the Bloody Mary was by far the best looking/tasting bloody I have ever had, the blueberries on the blueberry pancakes were fresh and phenomenal, and my server Alex was very attentive to my dietary needs and as a server myself, I know how annoying that can be so I was appreciative of that. 

However, the reason I did not give this place a 5 star rating is because the burrito with chorizo is by far the worst I've ever had. I do not recommend anyone to order it, ever."}
{"text":"A great spot for breakfast to start your day. The Fried Chicken and Waffles are to die for! The chicken was flavorful, savory, fried to a perfect crisp. No words can tell you how good that fried chicken was but with the red velvet waffles it was perfection! A little pricey but so worth it."}
{"text":"The cheddar biscuits and gravy was pretty good. Ask for tabasco on the side and its evennnn better ;) must hit up more than once cuz EVERY item looks delicious!"}
{"text":"I wanted to badly to like this place because of the location, how cute the restaurant is, and of course the simplicity in the name.  Unfortunately it just didn't hit the spot for me.  The food they offer is a bit basic, which I suppose is acceptable since the restaurant is attached to the Graduate hotel and maybe they want to keep things simple for traveling guests who don't want anything too frivolous.  But I was hoping to find more options and a bit more flavor.
I ordered the Denver omelette.  This wasn't cooked like a traditional omelette where the toppings are incorporated into the eggs.  This was basically cooked like a quesadilla.  Where the eggs is folded over like a tortilla and it's just filled with the toppings in the middle with some cheese.  I wouldn't have normally minded this, but my egg ended up folding and flopping open and the toppings spilled out from the middle.  So I was stuck trying to scoop them all back inside.  Eventually I gave up and just had to spoon all the ingredients into my mouth at the same time so that I didn't feel like I was eating it all separate.  
Our server was very nice but also very forgetful.  We were a table of 5 and only have 4 sets of utensils. Prior to our food coming out, we were prepping the table and asked the server for an extra set of utensils.  She forget.  When the food finally came out we asked our server AND the food runner for the utensils again.  Again forgotten.  I think they got distracted with another table.  So instead my friend ended up grabbing one off a nearby table.  The server never came back with those utensils.
She also never came back to check on us once our food was delivered.
Then at the end of the meal when she was asking us for our checks, I asked her if I could have a cup of ice so that I may take my orange juice to go.  She left our table to gather our checks and returned to deliver them (in a cute novel might i add!).  No cup of ice in hand.  When we all handed her back the checks with our forms of payment I asked her again for a cup of ice. She then returned with our copies of the check and no cup of ice.  Come on!!
I ended up giving up because I didn't want to have to keep asking. 
Although the food was decent and filled us up, I don't see myself returning back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Food is terrific, I haven't had a bad meal yet. The Service though lacks. The Servers are very young and tend to get frazzled with crowds. I do recommend the food though!"}
{"text":"It's hard not to miss this nostalgic retro diner when driving by ASU campus. It was once an IHOP that hosted the late night drinking college crowd. But since the Graduate Tempe took over the hotel it is located in, the Normal has made a name for itself with its hipster decor and creative dishes. The Graduate itself is fun to walk through to take in its vibrant modern colors. The Normal has a juice and coffee bar on one side of the building. The rest of the restaurant is a classic diner with cool lighting, a mural dedicated to the southwest and a wall installation of 8-Track tapes. I've never tried one of these popular bloody mary creations that you see everywhere and got their Redeemer version. It is garnished with some olives, deli meat and a burger slider. The bloody mary itself was delicious and had a nice peppery flavor to it. I couldn't quite get a knack for the garnishes and felt like I just making a big mess trying to disassemble it. But it was fun to look at and photograph. I also got the chicken and red velvet waffles for my main entree. I loved the chicken but felt the red velvet didn't add anything special to the waffles. But overall the service was wonderful and this ended up being a great throwback fun experience for me."}
{"text":"All the stars for the amazing ladies who always take care of us!  They are frequently busy but always super nice and helpful.

0 stars for changing the menu!  I come here at least once a month with friends and we always order the fried cheese curds.  This time it was gone and the menu was drastically different (including having almost no vegetarian options).  The food quality has also gone down significantly.  The omelet I had was overpriced, overcooked and bland.  They also got rid of the smashed potatoes that were so good and only carry dry hashbrowns that I could barely choke down.   Even the greasiest spoon restaurant has better food than this and for far cheaper.  This used to be one our favorite places but now I don't think we'll be back unless they go back to their old, amazing menu. :("}
{"text":"Food okay. Looks better on Yelp than it tastes. Gnats and flys everywhere. Sat next to a window full of them. Very unappealing. Service is good. Their in house donuts are good. Southwest breakfast dishes tasted better than their normal breakfast egg dishes. Toast and bacon and sausage seemed store bought. Nothing great."}
{"text":"Well that was unexpected! This place, as my mom would like to call it, is the bomb! I have been staying at the Graduate for the last week and I finally made it in for dinner...I really should have started eating here a week ago! I can see this place becoming a huge success. I will be back. Actually, I have already made plans on going there for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Hmm. Love the concept and the hotel next door is equally clever. Service was fine but a bit from outer space. Server didn't know menu well and forgot the one addition I asked for (here for breakfast at 8am on Thursday). 

I had the fat hen sandwich. Good but challah roll not right for an egg sandwich. Too soft and flimsy. I get not wanting hard, dense bread, but this is too far in the other direction. Flavors very good though. 

Not sure poached egg is also what they should recommend for an egg sandwich.  Two bites and it can't be a sandwich anymore (fork time).

The pressed juice was delicious (I had \"the norm\"), but yelpers beware: the deal just says \"free pressed juice\" upon check in. Then it tells you after check in it is buy one get one. Not swell if you're alone. 

$20 for a good egg sandwich and really good juice is still too much. I hate when concepts come with this kind of price tag."}
{"text":"Arrived in Phoenix and stopped by this place for a late dinner.  Had the double burger and sweet potato fries.  Both were good but the sweet potato fries and dipping sauce were really outstanding.  Could have just eaten a huge plate of these.
Stopped in the following morning for their hash breakfast.  Again, no disappointment here.  I'm not really a breakfast hash person but these were recommended and were excellent.  Would definitely order again.  
Wait staff was impressive as well.  Out of the way but quick to address any concerns.  Coffee and waters were constantly topped off.  
Great experience all around.  Need to go back and try the amazing looking bloody mary."}
{"text":"You must visit this resturaunt if you are near the ASU area! The food tastes fresh and the prices are decent!  They offer alot of choices as well. Today's visit was unusual being that my son and I had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.  This was the first time this has happened. It was hard not to notice some of the prepared tables that we felt we shoukd be sat at while our stomachs were grumbling....this is the reason I did not rate it a 5 on today...othan than that issue, the food is alway outstanding !"}
{"text":"Great place to grab some tasty breakfast in Tempe.  We came in for Sunday breakfast and I enjoyed the Farmer's omelet - egg whites and veggies...really tasty and healthy too.  Great atmosphere and great service too."}
{"text":"I'm convinced all the good reviews are from people who are either drunk or have never had good food. My wife ordered the veggie omelet which was inedible - it actually tasted rancid or as she described like \"chemicals\". I ordered the Red Velvet Waffle which looked incredible but was completely burnt on the bottom side. When I asked the party of 8 that I was with how their food was they all responded... \"Eh, it's ok.\"

I'd try them again for cocktails but I don't think their food will improve. Sorry Normal, your decor was the only thing winning!"}
{"text":"What a cute diner, I was pleasantly surprised by the interior. Came here because I found it on Groupon. We were seated quickly and the waiter was attentive and pleasant. I ordered the French toast which usually comes with a bacon caramel sauce. They were kind enough to to provide it without the bacon for me. My only negative would be the serving of breakfast potatoes I ordered. The portion and quality wasn't worth $4. Other than that, tasty French toast and great service. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved our experience at this place.

The location, ambiance and decor are spot on.  The only negative was the weird smell in the restaurant and bathroom.

The service was very good.  Strange that there were very few other diners in the time we were there.

Had dinner and tried -
Cereal Killer Milkshakes:  Kids loved them
Infused Old Fashioned: Amazing, loved the chunks of cherry
Bloody Mary: Delicious, fun with the cheeseburger and cheese curds and roasted red pepper Turkey/Avocado Club:  what you would expect
Breakfast Hamburger Sandwich: Fabulous
Short Rib Hash & Eggs: Pretty Good

Very much look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"In short: Poor service, decent but pricey food.

The atmosphere is vibrant with a really weird assortment of decor. My first impression was two hipsters with multiple personality disorder decorated and didn't communicate with each other at all.

The service was extremely slow, though courteous.

Take out would be a good option otherwise not really worth the price."}
{"text":"Food is average. Atmosphere is nice. The diner was slow and the service took foreverrr. The menu needs some more non-meat based options or at least don't put bacon on everything else. Twenty minutes to take our order. Twenty minutes to get our food. Twenty minutes for the check... Well maybe longer.. Im still waiting. This place is too slow pace and doesn't have enough options for this part of town.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! We live at the Graduate since we fly for Mesa and train in PHX. We eat here daily and enjoy the food and service. Amy is an exceptional server!"}
{"text":"I actually strolled in here after a night of heavy drinking, just based upon the reviews of the red velvet waffles and chicken (which were outstanding) I will be back again. Service was a little weird, our server was great, but actually getting seated was a bit weird as we didn't know if we sat ourselves or if we were seated so we waited a few minuted and finally someone came over."}
{"text":"Driest French toast I've ever had in my life. Good flavor but seriously It was hard to swallow. Couldn't even finish it. Left hungry."}
{"text":"WOW..   I could have ordered a pizza to be delivered quicker than it took to get our food after the server took our order.   And when we asked the manager when our food might show up, to her credit it immediately showed up, nice and cold...      

Oh and can you possibly buy any thinner slices of bacon, two (2) extremely thin slices constitute a side.      

We live in Tempe and always want to find a great location for breakfast or dinner, this isn't it."}
{"text":"Just went there on a very slow Saturday. Almost no customers. We were greeted & seated right away, & that was about it. Sat there for over 10 minutes, saw the staff just chilling out, some were just chatting to each other. We weren't even served water, or acknowledged by anyone. So, now we're at first watch and not regretting the decision to get up and leave. It's a shame though, I bet the food is good, if you ever get to it."}
{"text":"Discovered on Yelp. A bit of a drive for me but worth it. Tried both the breakfast and lunch menus and liked everything that I have had. They have some very interesting variations on some of the food selections."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and stopped in for a quick breakfast, so we just got coffee and pastries from the bar. I ordered a cappuccino, maple bacon donut, and a whoopie pie. The cappuccino and donut were delicious. We didn't really like the whoopie pie- so I would skip it. It looked cute though!  Overall, the food was yummy and the place was super hip. I would totally come again."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go. Kitchen messed up order and took much longer. Got the food home and found hair in two of the items. Breakfast burger was cold, yet sausage was so burnt it tasted terrible and could not eat. There were giant frozen chunks in the parfait as if frozen fruit was just put in a cup and served. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Ambience is essentially \"trying too hard\" embodied. The food is good, but what I had in particular was very poorly made. Eggs Benedict is really sour, I have no idea why. When I took a bite, I thought it was rotten. I didn't get sick, so I think it was just the flavor. The potatoes are good though."}
{"text":"Outrageously overpriced! $3.25 for a cup of coffee! And it wasn't even good coffee! Guess they are trying to pay for their hipster decor, ah yeah, a wall of 40 or so 8-Tracks 'll set you back about $2.25. 
I ordered the queche, was told it was ham & cheese, no ham, just a sprinkle of cheese, and since the queche was pre-made, heated up in the microwave, the inside was cold. 
Staff was super nice, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here before watching a show at the Gammage.   We arrived about 2 hours early to get a good parking spot and then walked over to The Diner!  The Bloody Mary was to die for!!! It was garnished with salami, cheese, peppers and A SLIDDER!! Not too strong and not too spicy. Absolutely perfect.    It's called THE REDEEMER!! The food was very good in portion size and so very fresh!   Or server, Madi, was so friendly and efficient!! I highly recommend it to anyone, whether you're  a parent, student, or theater enthusiast... Stop in at The Diner, You'll be very impressed!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Staff (Evelyn and Alex) and owner, Maria, are good folks! It's a labor of love! I highly recommend it! The pancakes are amazing!!! The minimum wage breakfast tastes like soul food! I also recently had the Coco Pow and it was both healthy and yummy!"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT. 
The decor and vibe were GREAT. 
The service was GOD AWFUL and the a/c was so high my boyfriend and I risked hypothermia. 

It's a shame the service was so bad because the food really was incredible. Hopefully front of the house can get their act together for the sake of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Love this place for a casual conversation or studying on the free wi-if!  Cool mid-century decor and lots of delicious and creative breakfast food served until 2.  Both the red velvet and malted pumpkin waffles are to die for, my friend had the breakfast hash and it was fresh and hearty!"}
{"text":"Always yummy!! I had the green chili pork omelette with breakfast potatoes. Very happy!!"}
{"text":"YUM! There were 9 of us here for a Yelp UYE Breakfast Club brunch this morning (thanks for setting this up Monica). This was a Howard Johnson's (and later HoJo then IHOP) location for many years and there were numerous and humorous homages to this retro past in the decor. Eight track tape collection on the wall, several large 1970s framed artwork pieces that had been re-arted with black markers, wacky collages, etc. The counter and booths were reminders of the diners from the 1950s and 60s. The Normal is the diner for The Graduate hotel and shares a parking lot with the hotel.

I had \"The Hash\" for $11.95. Now, I was expecting the typical roast beef hash from the Midwest, but this is a tangy Southwest version of that classic dish. The dish included braised beef short rib meat, with poblano chili roasted potatoes in a chile sauce with 2 eggs sitting on top. There were 3 corn tortillas on the plate. The process of loading the contents of the plate into the tortillas was a little messy but provided a delicious, lightly spicy concoction. The portion size was large (forget having room for desert if you order this dish). Service was friendly and patient with our large group. 

Overall, a big (saucy) thumbs up for The Normal."}
{"text":"red velvet waffles and chicken!!!  SO GOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!  I will be coming back next time I am in town for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I share the view offered by many here, one of promise not fully tapped.  The place is reminiscent of the Hotel Valley Ho with its hipsterish take on the mid-century modern look.  The menu has a fresh local approach to the comfortable diner fare.  The dishes while somewhat original don't really  fulfill the their promise.  The chicken in the chicken and waffles tasted like above average strips and the waffles were a tag limp and soggy.  Still it is a new enterprise and I am confident that it can grow into becoming a good meal for those times when I'm down at ASU."}
{"text":"took a while to cook my meal, considering it was mid-afternoon with less than 10 customers in the place, but the red velvet waffles were fantastic and the chicken was good too.
thumbs up!"}
{"text":"1 star for having decent food and cute menus and a nice interior decoration but thats abt it. 

It was slow when i came in so it doesnt make sense that the server took a while to take my order. I ordered \"the hash\". One plate. You had one job. The server asked how i wanted my eggs i told her scrambled. They werent scrambled. The menu says this plate comes with guajillo sauce and hashbrowns, and as you can see in the photos, neither are there. There was potato in the brisket but thats not hashbrowns?? What kind of diner is this lolol. 

Management needs to train their servers better, and the kitchen needs to figure out how to make actual hashbrowns."}
{"text":"They have great food and coffee in the morning and an amazing Bloody Mary! They have a great location very close to campus with parking which isn't something you find often. It's a very hipster vibe if you are in to that sort of thing. Lots of interesting art in the wall and great to take someone who is visiting!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Alex was super cool !!! the place is clean, great service, very contemporary  yet 50's feeling , non greasy , not your usual diner but better looking tasty food, great presentation :]..  When I said not your usual place you have not to think about eggs bacon and bread, not at all , there is more than that, \"food with style\". 

The fact that they bring some art to it and some culture is a plus, such as your check(invoice) inside a small book , intensionally to motivate you to read part of it, insisting that you read some paragraphs that perhaps brings some knowledge and laughs. 

Over all is a place to enjoy food friends and infused cocktails. :} 
Love it!!

{"text":"Sooo disappointed! !!  The first impressions are so important. Our first and last visit.  The coffe was dood, 3.25 a cup.  The menu has limited offerings. For a so called Normal Diner,  there were only 2 meals that were normal. I could go on and on !!!  So not worth it!"}
{"text":"The Normal is a diner that is not normal by any means!  It is a diner in a hotel that borders that Arizona State University campus.  For those who didn't know, ASU was once known as the Tempe Normal School, so the name is certainly rooted in ASU history.  It's in a great location right across the street from Gammage Auditorium as well as several ASU residence halls.  While I have only been there for brunch or lunch, I know many students at Gammage-goers have enjoyed late night meals at The Normal.  

Breakfast and lunch is everyday from bright and early at 6:30 AM to 2:30 PM.  I have never had to wait before as there is plenty of seating, and the service is great.  The menu has a school-themed look to it with \"notes taken\" on the menu.  Definitely follow those recommendations!  That's how I found out about the After-School Special, which is a BBQ brisket havarti and aged cheddar grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup.  Then again, my friend I was with also recommended it.  

They have egg dishes and breakfast dishes from the griddle, grill/sandwiches, green & fit items, starters and sides, and children's menu items.  They also have smoothies, doughnuts, and other sweets along with a variety of cocktails, beers, wines, and yes, some non-alcoholic beverages.  

Again, it is a diner though with an ASU spin on it!  As such, if you're an Arizona Wildcat, be warned.  You might not feel right at home but you'll love the food!"}
{"text":"The malted waffle that my wife got was delicious. The green chili pork omelette that I got was very disappointing. 

Menu says the green chili is spicy. It's not spicy at all. It was also very dry. The potato \"cake\" was like a serving of mashed potatoes that was browned on both sides and still mush in the middle. Not very cake-like."}

I took your location for granted, why oh why
This food is awesome, say Oh-My!


Baw-chika Baw Baw is more like it.....bringing the 70s back!

There is nothing normal about The Normal unless we jumped in a time machine and went \"back to the future\"!  The place is a welcoming change and definitely stylish with nostalgia.  I came with a date and we generally like to order a lot to try a little bit of this and that.  To start we went with a side of Red Velvet Waffles (yeah right!?), then a TC Chopped Salad.  For entrees we ordered The Bison Burger and chef Blackboard; which was chefs choice of the day....or time; it was actually beef brisket street tacos.  

The Red Velvet Waffles was definitely interesting, it a minor hit of red velvet cake taste, but not strong.  Fluffy and doughy at the same time and perfect with some butter and maple syrup.  The chopped salad came with pepitas, corn, blueberry raisins, couscous, and shredded chicken breast.  The pepitas and corn provided a crunchy and nutty bite while the raisins and couscous made it chewy and sweet; overall a solid healthy salad!  The BBQ brisket tacos were probably the star of the night.  Street as it should be and a spicy kick since it was topped with a couple red chili peppers!  Sprinkle it with some lime and bam we're golden!.  My least favorite of the meals was probably the Bison burger.  I've had Bison burger many times elsewhere and it is never good in my opinion.  The product should be left whole as a steak and to grind up such a premium ingredient is atrocious!  Needless to say, I didn't care for it.  

The service was awesome thanks to our server Alex.  He was attentive and helpful with the menu.  Overall, a great place for some eats and to bring back some memories..... - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came in to try the Normal, due to the red velvet chicken and waffles. Well chicken is well fried, but not a lot of flavor. Waffles were yummy. Got 2 eggs and some potatoes to split and the eggs were eggs the potatoes were extra crispy....so not the best. 

Service was almost non existent as our food was brought out, and our waitress came to see us to see how we were doing when we were over half done. 

At this moment I'm hoping someone actually brings my check to me.........

The cost seemed a little high for the quality as well, which is really adding up to you should go to one of the 100 other places in the area that are well reviewed. 

The potential to be good is here, but the attention to detail, & the so-so food will hold it back. If not for being right next door to a hotel the place would end up right in the middle of the mediocre universe."}
{"text":"I had the red velvet chicken and waffles and was very impressed. Not only was the food great, but the atmosphere was fun (restaurant was clean, good music in the background) and the staff was incredibly friendly. My C&W + coffee + tip only came out to be $20, which was well worth the price of the experience and food."}
{"text":"So I had a late breakfast/lunch yesterday around 3 and noticed my burger was somewhat pink, although I had ordered it well-done.  It was too late, I had already eaten too much of it.  I also ordered the fruit instead of fries and noticed the fruit tasted funny, but couldn't put my finger on why.
Fast forward to the evening around 6 hours later, it begins.  I believe I was food poisoned.  I have been on the toilet every 30-45 min since 9 or so, and it is shooting out.  I've had food poisoning two other times in my life, once from Filiberto's and once from Buffalo Wild Wings.  I know what it is like, and I am in that painful hell right now.  The Buffalo Wild Wings was by far the worst, I was hospitalized from that and needed an I.V.  This is bad and I have chills, am aching everywhere, but I haven't thrown up yet because I'm not drinking anything until this passes, but if I were to start hurling, it would be equal to Buffalo Wild Wings.
I just finished another round; it's almost 7am and I've gotten no sleep all night.  I am angry because I should have checked the burger and left.  I also think something is up with how they store food because the fruit tasted odd.
There is absolutely no way I will ever step foot in that place again.  As far as it being a generic diner concept it is exactly that on the inside and outside, superficially.  But the food is not normal.  It is like having a ghost in my ass that needs an exorcist."}
{"text":"I love this place, and I have never had a bad meal or experienced poor service (John, especially, is awesome). The only reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is because they removed my favorite item, the Fat Hen, from their new menu. I had even been assured that since it was a favorite it would not be removed from the menu. Alas! It seems management doesn't care. Please, if the Powers That Be of Normal Diner are reading this, please return the Fat Hen to its rightful place on your menu. Pretty please. With tomato jam on top."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review, but I'm doing it because I hope that the owners are paying attention and will use it as an opportunity to improve things. I have been regularly supporting since The Normal since it opened; it's in my neighborhood and I want to see it succeed. I had high hopes for this funky little diner with its charming decor and wonderful location. However, after dozens of meals at The Normal, I'm sorry to say that it is simply sub-par. The service has never been on point--despite the restaurant rarely being crowded, it's slow and not particularly friendly, and my orders often get mixed up. I've tried just about everything on the breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus. The only remotely impressive item was the fried donuts, which have since been removed and replaced with some other sort of donut that isn't nearly as good. The ingredients are clearly not fresh, from the fruit salad made mostly of cantaloupe (dead giveaway) to the hard, dry chicken tenders that even the kids can't stomach. Management doesn't solicit feedback or attempt to make connections with the local community, which is a shame. I actually miss the IHOP that was previously in this location. It was always bustling with energy. Judging by the empty tables at The Normal, the surrounding community must feel the same way."}
{"text":"Came for a late breakfast after seeing and hearing great things about this place. Tying to eat a little healthier so ordered just a side salad and cup of the soup of the day, broccoli cheddar. 
First, the salad: browned wilted lettuce with cut cherry tomatoes and a couple of cukes, served on a hot plate. Tried to eat it as quickly as possible before it got hot but it didn't really work so well, until I ate a tomato and tasted mold... salad was done then. 
The soup was tasty upon first bite unfortunately then all I could taste was salt. Felt like I was eating a salt block. I ate the chunks of broccoli and that was done too. 
My husband had a hollandaise chicken biscuit which sounded amazing.  He said it was pretty good. I tasted the chicken and unfortunately it seemed to be breaded with salt. Hollandaise seemed to be home made though and was tasty, and was served with some tasty breakfast potatoes. 
Overall disappointed and don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Cool decor inside. I really enjoyed the Blueberry Pancakes. Strange thing to write, but their menus are really hard to read. It's almost like the ink has faded off of the pages. It was very consistent on all of the menus. I was staying at the Graduate hotel for 4 nights so we had breakfast at the Normal Diner each morning. My biggest critisim is the service, it is extremely SLOW. Every morning, it always took forever to get our food. I'm not sure why that was, as it wasn't very busy. We'd show up at least 45 minutes before we had to leave to be on campus, and each morning there were always a few people who weren't able to get the food they ordered because it took so long, and we had to leave. Strange."}
{"text":"Just had brunch at the normal and we were left with only a mediocre experience. The place is newly renovated and it has a lot of charm. Service was okay, nothing stand out. I ordered the after school special (brisket grilled cheese w/tomato soup) and the husband ordered the sausage cheddar biscuits w/ gravy. I enjoyed my meal but felt like it was more of just a brisket sandwich, as the cheese flavor was hardly noticeable. When ordering the biscuits and gravy, we thought it would be a sausage gravy, but instead it was sausage links on the side. The sausages had great flavor but the biscuits and gravy fell flat, in fact the gravy was barely warm. 

I wouldn't mind giving them another chance sometime but we weren't that impressed."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel for a few nights.
Omg red velvet chicken and waffles. So good!! I love red velvet cake, I love fried chicken, waffles are heavenly and the red velvet chicken waffles were magical.

If you want something healthier, go for the avocado toast. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"AVOID!  I never had a chance to try the food.  I put in my order, turkey sandwich and a water.  25 minutes later no sandwich.  The waitress brought me a hamburger, well done.  I told her that wasn't mine.  There were only two other tables with people and they all had their food, so the waitress walked around with a confused look on her face.  She eventually put the burger in a to go box and offered it to the other tables, meanwhile, I still had nothing in front of me.  Another waiter asked me if I needed anything and I said I'd just like the sandwich I ordered more than 20 minutes ago.  He went into the kitchen and the waitress came out asking me what I ordered again.   At that point I told her \"the exit\" and walked out."}
{"text":"I like this place.  Have been wanting to get here ever since they opened.  Staff was great.  They ensured that everything was the way we wanted it.  Atmosphere and decor is very nice.  Went for breakfast, we will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Went to The Normal before attending my daughter's fashion show. This was the first time we've been to this restaurant so I asked for recommendations. I ended up ordering the hash breakfast and my oldest ordered the fruity pebbles french toast.  I also ordered a cup of coffee with my meal. First I had to return the coffee because I found coffee grinds in my cup. Even after returning the coffee, the next cup had coffee grinds as well. I didn't complain, just drank my water instead. The hash was less than desirable. My daughter advised the french toast was okay but nothing to write home about. She asked to try my dish and didn't care for it either. I tend to give a restaurant a second chance unless it was really bad regarding service, food, and atmosphere. Our waitress was helpful and the location was cute. I will give The Normal another opportunity to see if I will make it my normal."}
{"text":"Do not, under any circumstances, order the tomato bisque. I'm pretty sure it's just jarred marinara with a squirt of sour scream on top.

Their bloody Mary's lack flavor and alcohol but at $6 a pop, I'm not going to cry about that. 

Service was pretty slow. 

Just meh -- probably damn good after a kegger at 3am."}
{"text":"Great Place.  Stayed in the hotel attached to this diner and was very impressed with the food.  I went to ASU during the time this location was a IHOP so it was definitely an upgrade from my college days.  

I had a really great server named Haley R who made the experience even more enjoyable.  The avocado ham sandwich adding an egg is a must! It's one thing to come back for homecoming, it's another thing to have a waitress who makes you feel like you never left. Forks Up!"}
{"text":"I was last here a couple of years back for a UYE and remembered it as good enough for a return trip with a couple of friends. Things started off on the wrong foot when we walked in and the cook at that time was a no show. Then they gave us the wrong menus to start, I guess different days get different menus. It turns out the hash recipe has changed even though we called in advance and were told the online menu is the current one. My chicken was rather salty and dry. The waffles were already too cold to melt the butter when they got to the table. They were tasty however. The two women working the front of the house were doing their best to smooth out the bumps and I hope their day got better."}
{"text":"How convenient to have this cute retro diner attached to the Graduate Hotel. I'm used to hotel restos being overpriced and underwhelming, but the Normal was a step above. The breakfast menu is really big, with tons of eggy, starchy, even fruity options. The malted waffle sandwich was fabulous: eggs, ham, cheddar layered between thick waffle slices. So filling. And only $10! Not bad for hotel pricing. 

If you're trying to be healthy, the \"smoothies\" were, sadly, disappointing. Too icy, they need a better blender or something. But coffee was strong and refills plentiful, and the staff are very accommodating with substitutions and large groups. Quite pleased!"}
{"text":"Wanted to take my oldest out to eat, and she didn't feel like going anywhere fancy, so I convinced her to give The Normal a try, so off we went!

She is a picky eater, and even she was able to find something she liked, she ordered the cheeseburger plan, just meat, cheese and bread and some sweet potato fries, she loved those fries!

I went with the crispy spiced chicken breast sandwich and swapped the fries for the roasted poblano potatoes, delish!  The chicken was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, it came with Applewood bacon, Swiss cheese, siriacha aioli on a roll, and this was a great tasting sandwich! And the roasted potatoes went will with it!

Since that time I went with my daughter, I did wind up back at The Normal before I could finish the last update, so I am combining both on this review haha, this time it was on a Friday night before a show at The Gammage, and I have to say this place was poppin!  I did learn from my program at the Gammage that if you show your tickets you can get 15% off your check at The Normal, I didn't know this, so I didn't, but next time you bet I will!

I can say The Hash is still on point, that is just a great tasting dish, but what was the winning dish that night was the red velvet waffles and chicken, that chicken is amazing! Tender, sweet and perfect! Even though I had The Hash, I had plate envy and had to give it a try!

The Normal is fast becoming a favorite of mine, and I'm sure I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Mouth watering food that tastes great. The atmosphere of the diner is spectacular and all the employees are very polite and nice."}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews of The Normal, w were looking forward to a delicious meal. 
But let's start with the staff... It was my 65th birthday and we were on our way to celebrate  Wicked at Gammage. Despite it being slammed, the hostess quickly sat us at a table. Alex, shadowed by trainee, Cassandra, appeared, waters in hand, asking us what we wanted to order... 
Wedge salad, tomato soup and a brisket sandwich, and, hands down, the best crisp fried chicken in between red velvet waffle quarters. The salad wasn't a wedge and lettuce, unchilled, was unremarkable. A bit of créme fraiche swirled atop a homemade tomato soup accompanied a blah lukewarm brisket on toasted Texas bread. On the other hand, don't miss the flavorful red velvet waffle surrounding freshly fried chicken. 
Alex brought the tab promptly along with to go boxes. He offered this new senior citizen a dessert to go - bacon cream frosting - mmmmm. As we left, Alex suggested arriving about 90 minutes before any Gammage event. Good advice. 
Service - 5, Food - 3. Overall - 3+."}
{"text":"I fell head over heels for this place. Probably one of the best overall breakfast experience I've ever had. My waitress was so nice, she made small talk with me and helped me with my order. Not to mention she didn't charge me for my drink order because they didn't have the original smoothie I wanted. The food was unique and delicious. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and the egg was perfectly poached! Also loved the potatoes especially with the peppers added to them. I felt satisfied afterwards. The service was fantastic! I will be bringing friends and family to this place from now on. I can't wait to try more things on their menu especially their shakes which looked phenomenal. Officially one of my new favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Stayed at the graduate for a few days while attending a spring training game and visiting Tempe so we decided to eat at the Normal diner which is right next door. Service was good, food was OK. 

My omelet had a lot of oil on it & the potatoes had too much onion 

Atmosphere is fun & the decor is pretty cool. I tried to use the free juice when u check in but it's B1G1 and my fiancé doesn't like that kind of juice so we passed"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was delicious, and the decor and music--outstanding! My husband and I had the Hash. It was a perfect amount of food, creative and well cooked. I had my eggs over medium, hubby had poached as on the menu. Coffee was nice as well. I think the menu could stand to be $1-$2.00 cheaper but overall a great experience. I will be back, probably this week."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff, and food! They give you you're check in a book! It's adorable. They also have old fashioned desserts like whoopie pies and cookies and milk! I love having breakfast here and it's close to ASU."}
{"text":"This place has great decor but that is where the greatness stops. The service was very slow, the server Michelle only checked on us twice and she forgot to bring creamer and it took one of us to track her down im the restaurant to get some creamer. The food took really long to come out, for some simple brekfast items it shouldn't take 40 minutes. When the food did come out it wasn't hot, it was warm but it seemed like it was probably sitting at the window for a while. My friend ordered the \"Minimum Wage\" breakfast and it only came with one piece of toast. I had the french toast, which had too much cinammon on them, kind of cold and the fruit that came with it was stale. I was excited to try this place out because I live near by, but I definitely won't be returning or recommending this place to out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Such a cute place. Terrible service. Didn't seat us where we wanted. Brought the wrong shake. After half an hour asked where are food was and was told it would be another 15 minutes. It was busy, but there's never an excuse for a 45 minute wait for breakfast. We canceled our order. Manager didn't even bother to come over and apologize. What a bummer. Really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"The best thing about the normal diner was the service. The waiters were very nice and attentive but not annoying. Exactly how I like it. The only thing was the food. I got an eggs Benedict with an over cooked egg and the potatoes were just warm. There's still potential so I may give them another shot."}
{"text":"This place has really come along way since its early days. Eaten here twice recently, both dinner and breakfast. Reasonable priced and high quality. I recommend the fried pickles and sea salt chocolate chip cookies. Both the french toast and biscuit breakfast sandwich were also excellent. Try the maple bacon bar for a decadent treat.

Will be back due to the great service and no wait times for Friday night / Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Just avoid this place altogether. I just went there with my boyfriend and it was overpriced, service was bad, and we waited forever for the food. The menu is extremely limited as well. There's three egg options, three griddle options, and three lunch sandwiches. The waitress never came to check on how our food came out once we got it. We waited for awhile to get ice tea refills and when I made eye contact with our waitress Ashley about ten feet away, she asked if we needed something. She didn't come over and I had to shout across the room to let her know we needed more ice tea. My boyfriend's waffles weren't crispy at all, and his chicken was burnt."}
{"text":"I always come here when there's a play I'm going to at Gammage and it's not that bad. They might be a little bit more on the expensive side and they don't really have that much food either. They have about 10 signature dishes and then there are sides and drinks as well as dessert. I always order the minimum wage breakfast and it's really good, comes with 2 eggs (however you like it), sausage or bacon, potatoes, and toast - but I always subsitute it for their red velvet waffle. Their red velvet waffle is seriously to die for. It's soooooo good. Overall, food was great. But the service was kind of slow, and there wasn't that much people there every single time I went there; other than that, place is good."}
{"text":"Crowded pre-show meal at Gammage. We had a brunch more of less. The graduate burger was far overdone, when we asked for Medium. Crispy Spiced Chicken Sandwich was just okay, not particularly flavorful. Service was somewhat inattentive. Took forever to get my Cappuccino. Could've been so much better."}
{"text":"The chocolate malt was one of the more unfortunate experiences of ice cream pleasure. The other option is sugar cereal milk left to ferment, then  blended.
The waiter was a good guy, but slovenly in appearance and it took a freakin long while on a slow evening to produce a shake. Meh. I feel a bit harsh, but I paid five bucks for it. .. and it wasn't a \"f-ing good milkshake\"."}
{"text":"Would not recommend this restaurant we stopped in while staying at the Graduate Hotel. It was very slow on a Saturday morning should of been our first clue. Food was not good we were served frozen fries and burnt burger with undercooked meat and slow service. Gave two stars because it was cute inside and waiter was very nice."}
{"text":"First off, I've been inside here when it was an IHOP a hundred times. It was a staple of post-Marquee concerts and late night Mill Ave. adventures growing up. It was kind of surreal walking in and having it completely different inside, but I loved the decorations. Very 1960s with bright colours and quirky murals and 8-tracks lining the walls. There's a coffee bar on the left so you can run in for a espresso drink without having to be seated. It seemed pretty empty for a Thursday night prime-ASU location, but maybe finals are over - I'm a bit too old to care about school scheduling these days.
First impressions aside, the menu was kind of hard for me to decide on. We almost left because we didn't see anything that really caught our attention. It seemed very Midwestern yet eccentric with things like cheese curds and fried pickles next to bison burgers and kale salad. Not your typical diner fare, which was disappointing as it's just what I wanted. I guess I was hoping for IHOP with a re-brand. 
I ended up with the cheddar biscuits with gravy and shared a thing of cheese curds. Having lived in Minnesota for the past two years, I've become somewhat of a cheese curd aficionado and no true Midwesterner would call these authentic curds. They were more fried sharp white cheddar, though that's not necessarily a bad thing flavour-wise. The ranch they came with was really good too. The cheddar biscuits and gravy was also decent, though I didn't like their sausage at all (it came with two links, as well as in the gravy). It had an odd gamey flavour to it, maybe it wasn't pork? I'm not sure as it just says \"sausage\" on the menu, but I'd suggest a change in provider. I love sausage and I couldn't stand to eat these. The biscuits also had no distinct cheddar flavour, probably drowned out by the gravy. These were more normal biscuts rather than, say, Cheddar Bay style, like I expected. They would have been a lot better with some seasoning and large sharp cheddar chunks, for sure. 
I think this place is just trying too hard to be retro-hip. They should focus more on just being a diner that drunk college students would want to come to after a game or concert, not a posh brunch joint for middle class people. Who wants a quinoa and kale with blueberries salad after consuming overpriced cheap beer (or ever, if we'd all just be honest with ourselves)? No one."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if that were an option. I'd love to tell you how the food was, but after sitting and waiting for an hour and a half, we left. No food. Server had an attitude. We will not return, ever. Save yourself the trouble and skip this joint in favor of Tapacubo. Best. Tacos. Ever."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving these guys a bad review, but I haven't been so underwhelmed by a restaurant in a long while so I had to hop on yelp and review these guys.

I can tell you why this restaurant is so underwhelming - it presents itself as super chic, hipster and thoughtful and turns out to be just really \"mehh\" once the food comes out. It sets you up for disappointment; it literally kind of feels (and tastes) like all of the focus went into the decorations around you and the food is an afterthought.

 I went with my lady; we both immediately noticed on walking in how nice and tasteful everything looked albeit pretty hipster. We set down, looked over a pretty good-looking menu and I ordered the \"gringo burrito\" because I felt like a breakfast burrito. I know ordering something called the gringo burrito was probably a stupid idea in the first place, but I was pretty appalled to see the stupid thing come out wrapped in brown paper that had fused to the tortilla like glue which made it literally unwrappable without spilling the insides all over my plate. I basically had a lukewarm, inside out, bland tasting burrito with a soggy tortilla splayed out in front of me. The meat - chorizo I think it was supposed to be - tasted like literally nothing. Just some bland gritty filler to wrap with potatoes. I was instantly taken back to my elementary school cafeteria days and I had paid 12 dollars for it.  It was around this point I made a mental note to hop on here and share my experience.

That being said, the salsa they gave me with the burrito was pretty damn good and literally made the entire dish edible, and my lady's french toast wasn't bad but she wasn't impressed either. I give this place 2 stars for actually trying to put on a decent appearance, but other than that I am pretty mad at it for not even thinking its food decisions through. Who lets a burrito get soggy in paper before serving it? And who lets it taste that crappy? I'd be willing to bet whoever it was, they spent most of their brainpower on choosing what shape of lights to stick over the coffee bar or which old books would make good check-trays. Mehh"}
{"text":"Decor - 5 star

Service - 2 star (Waiter was friendly but looked like he never combed his bedhead hair.  He also looked and sounded stoned.

Food - a big disappointment!  Eggs Benedict were supposed to come on a LGO English muffin.  NOT!  It wasn't even a Thomas' English muffin.  Portion size was small and the chorizo tasted like the kind you squeeze out of a pouch.

Both my friend and I were really disappointed with our experience here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this diner because it's so convenient when ur staying at the hotel. But the service is sub par and it takes SO LONG to get your meal. A diner shouldn't take 25 minutes to get you a regular breakfast, especially when it isn't anything special. This place could be great, if managed a little differently. Get a better manager!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like The Normal, I really did. But after the breakfast we had I have to say I don't.

My boyfriend and I visited on Saturday morning. We got there a little before 9 and it wasn't very busy yet. In the parking lot there was a car with a backseat window smashed so that's awesome. I assume it happened overnight but who knows.

Anyway, we were sat right away and given menus. Our waitress came over and offered drinks and asked us if we were ready to order. Considering we just sat down and this is a new restaurant that's not a chain, we said we needed a minute. She must have counted 60 seconds because she was back very quickly. I don't know what the hurry was but we ordered - I got the minimum wage (eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes) and my boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy.

Our meals came out and the first thing we both noticed was my eggs. They looked really weird. Really crumbly and dry. They tasted kinda weird too - actually they didn't taste like anything - they were just bland and unappetizing. I'm guessing they were powdered? I've never had \"eggs\" like this before. The bacon was meh. The potatoes were pretty good and the homemade jam for the toast was good. (tip - ask for the jam, my toast came out with none) Boyfriend's biscuits were super dense. The sausage was overcooked and tough. For the price of the food, I would expect the quality to be much higher.

By the time we were done the place had filled up. When our waitress left our check and said \"have a nice day\" she wasn't even looking at us. How sincere.

We left feeling very unsatisfied and on the way out I commented that I wished it were still IHOP. It was a total bummer of a breakfast."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd morning Here to have breakfast. The service is quick, fast and friendly and the food is excellent. I had the multi waffle yesterday and I was going to try something different today but unfortunately I have to get the waffle again.  It's so convenient when you are staying here at the hotel to just come downstairs and have a really good breakfast before you start your day."}
{"text":"WARNING - UNDERCOOKED MEAT!!  
Our experience with this diner located across from Gammage used to be quite good. They offer a discount for theater-goers on the night of performances, and since we are season ticket holders, we enjoyed that discount regularly. The food is reasonably priced, and it is one of the few locations convenient to walk to after parking (a must, since traffic and parking can be a nightmare on show nights if you don't get there quite early). Our last three visits, however, have been problematic. The first problem was several months ago and involved an extremely long wait for our food. When the burger I ordered finally got there, I was prepared to wolf it down just to make it to our show on time. However, it was basically seared on the outside and completely raw on the inside. There was not enough time to have them fix it prior to our show. They did remove the charge from our bill and provided a 25% discount coupon for a future visit. The next visit there, I ordered a salmon, and it was raw in the middle. We sent it back, and they threw my partially-eaten salmon back on the grill and then brought it out to me again (I've never had this happen before, as restaurants usually make a whole new meal, but I didn't have a problem with this - just thought it was different.) I don't recall if we were given a discount for this mistake. The last visit was only a few days ago, and given our more recent experiences, I ordered my burger well done (I usually like it medium well). The burger was medium on one half and rare on the other half. I asked for the manager. A harried woman who clearly had been in the back cooking came to our table. I told her that this was our third visit where grossly undercooked food had come to our table, and while we had good experiences in the past, we considered 3 visits over several months in which we were served dangerously undercooked meat to be our breaking point. I told her we would not likely be back, but that I felt management should be aware of the risk to customers presented by consistently undercooked meat. She listened politely, said she would \"uh... fix it,\" and left. I was seriously underwhelmed with her response. Honestly, I don't think she cared. They did comp the burger. If we go back, we won't order any meats... but it's unlikely we'll go back. If they are that inattentive to foods with the highest risk of food-borne illness, I can't imagine what else goes on in their kitchen. Maybe the situation is different on nights they do not have a Gammage rush, but I can't speak to that."}
{"text":"I'm not sure which I was a bigger fan of; the delicious fried chicken and red velvet waffle or the ample free parking in the facist parking state that is the ASU area.  This diner is in the Graduate hotel and is a really nice spot for breakfast, lunch or brunch.  The menu offerings range from standard breakfast to quiches, sandwiches, burgers and the aforementioned chicken and waffles. There are lots of sweet treats like doughnuts, whoopie pies and shakes that I look forward to trying the next time I stop in.  

Regarding the food, the biscuit sandwich was pretty boring and not up to the caliber of the waffle. Prices are fair and they even had an all you can eat pancake special going on for $5.  A waffle by itself will run you $4 and with the fried chicken it's $12.  The chicken was perfectly breaded and cooked so I'd recommend that.  

If you're in Tempe and want a high quality breakfast without dealing with the Mill Ave parking, stop by here."}
{"text":"The menu is eclectic, but the service is slow. Ten minutes to get water, Three quarters of an hour before the meal arrived, soup, sandwich, and salad. Its not complicated to make and it wasn't all that hot when it came out, so I suspect out waitress was just as disorganized as she seemed. And of course, no soup spoon..."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience with Madi as our server! She was very knowledge and extremely attentive to our various dietary needs. We got the chicken and waffles and breakfast hash and they were both amazing! Will definitely be back for the food and the amazing service Madi provided us!"}
{"text":"I have been to normal diner before and enjoyed the food, service and ambiance. However today I was very disappointed. We arrived for brunch around 11:30 and ordered the hash and the biscuits and gravy. Both dishes looked completely unappetizing on arrival to our table. The potatoes and meat on the hash tasted old, burnt, and my boyfriend felt that he couldn't get the taste of \"old tires\" out of his mouth. The gravy on the biscuits was obviously very old. I really should have taken a picture because it really looked like cat vomit. Such a disappointing experience. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was absolutely amazing and the atmosphere had a very cool but laid back vibe. We were in Tempe for 3 days and ate breakfast here both mornings because we were so blown away the first day that we had no desire to eat breakfast anywhere else. The first morning I had the gringo burrito and my boyfriend has the breakfast burger. We both had mimosas. He had the typical with OJ and I had cranberry. Both excellent. Second day I had the breakfast burger and he had the green chilie omelette. Everything was so good but we agreed the breakfast burger with the poblano potatoes was out favorite! We also agreed the cranberry mimosas were bomb. 

Our first waitress wasn't as outgoing or friendly as the second but she was nice enough. We will definitely be visiting this diner again next time we are in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This place lacks substance.
There was very little thought put into the menu, or what was actually put into the food itself. I was very disappointed by the whole experience. The decor was beautiful, vintage and hip. It was the highlight of the meal. I really hope this place makes some changes in the near future. You cant just take money and throw it at something and hope it will be brilliant. You need hard work behind it."}
{"text":"First time diner here and it wasn't great but will give it another try in the future since they did comp my sandwich. 

The good: My friend and boyfriend both enjoyed their chicken and waffles and my friend said the burger was good. The mimosa and Bloody Mary were good too. The server was very friendly and the atmosphere is great. 

The not so good: The pomegranate tea has a bad aftertaste so don't order that. They brought me the other iced tea instead but it tasted like the cheap Lipton stuff (and costs $2.50). My friend ordered a cappuccino and it was hardly a latte (almost no foam). I had a breakfast sandwich and specifically said I don't eat meat and wanted to substitute avocado as well as add cheese. The sandwich arrived luke warm with no cheese (though a great amount of avocado!) and there was a big chunk of shredded meat in my potatoes and they were also hardly warm. The server offered to bring a replacement plate of potatoes and they were cold too! 

Basically it just seems like the kitchen needs some help. They were not busy at all when we arrived but perhaps the kitchen is understaffed.

I'll give them another chance."}
{"text":"I ate here three times this weekend while staying at the Graduate for a conference. 

Day 1: good service, good food, no problems. Was excited to come back.

Day 2: My drink order was incorrect three times in a row and my omelette was wrong as well. Receipts were completely off. No, I did not order 6 milks. Waitress \"fixed\" it by giving a 15% discount -- but this did not cover the cost of the extra charges. 

Day 3: My order was wrong again, and my drink once again came out incorrectly twice -- they never did manage to get it right (it was not hard - a large vanilla latte to go, that's it!). My friend's \"over easy\" eggs were brown and hard - no runny yolk whatsoever, and her turkey sausage was still cold in the middle. Pretty gross. The service was absolutely horrible. We waited 20 minutes for a menu while one of the two waitresses folded napkins. Another table stormed out angrily and none of the staff noticed.

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"So we were extremely excited to try this place out It is very close home and work And I must say, we were not disappointed in the least. Renovations look great and Cameron, our server, was nice and knowledgeable. But most importantly, the food was amazing I had the Fat Hen Sandwich and the beef brisket was on point and the tomato jam put it over the top Great first experience, definitely going back to try more!"}
{"text":"how could that possibly the best Bloody Mary in the valley when that thing is so small, it looks like a kids meal cup size glass and gone in 2 drinks? The burger slider is is about as big as 3 olives, compare size in pic if you dont believe me, I had 1 in Pensacola that came in a pint glass and was also a full meal for $16.  Ya need to step up the game"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time here, probably the last.

Bloody mary: $15. Supposed to come with 2 slider patties based on the picture, we got two 1/4 patties per drink so basically 1 patty between the  2 of us. Cooked beyond well done. Drink not even filled up in the glass, and can't taste any vodka.

Wedge salad: claims to use \"baby\" lettuce, normal iceberg.

Hash: tasted good, just can't cook eggs over easy, still slimey. 

Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try The Normal this past Thursday, after friend Chef Jeff K. had suggested I try it when he told me that his restaurant would be closed the weekend after Christmas.  He admitted he hadn't had a chance to go himself, but that he'd heard good buzz about it.  

I swung by after my massage ended, sometime around 2p, and I was the only person there, which was great, as that allowed me to ask server Evelyn about menu ingredients of a few items that interested me and to roam freely and take photos while I waited for the food to arrive.  Everywhere I looked was a feast for the eyes!  I saw a framed signage of the diner with a country background set against honeycomb-style wallpaper; gorgeous stained-glass Tiffany-esque ceiling lights twinkling above me; one hundred ninety-four eight-track tapes lined up on a wall, and then I noticed that at the end of this wall, outside the diner, there's a stonewall cap; graffitied lithographs, or perhaps originals, and a mural on two other walls; concave tiles aligning the halls leading to the restrooms AND part of the restaurant ceiling; columns made of gold glass tiles; color-block booth seating and dark green velvet chairs with wood tables; a long glass-topped table for communal seating, or perhaps a large party reservation; and beautiful parquet flooring.  My brain was inundated by all these stimuli-- I was having so much fun, and I hadn't even tried the food yet!

After Evelyn had retrieved all the answers from the kitchen I needed, I was able to narrow my choices for my first visit to Chicken n Waffles to start, and the Sundae Funday and a Haitian single-origin coffee to cap. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-normal-tempe?select=BRTGzTAtr4UA_rj281QEGg#BRTGzTAtr4UA_rj281QEGg  The waffles are probably one of the better-tasting red velvet waffles I've tried (maybe the second-best), but the textures on the inside left me confused in the beginning (semi-crunchy exterior and gummy interior) until I decided that I wasn't enjoying them.  The chicken, on the other hand, was very good-- great breading/batter (no corn products!), and had a spicy pepper seasoning flavor.  I asked if it was Tabasco I tasted, but was told it was an overnight marinade made with Frank's Red Hot sauce.  This dish is worth ordering alone just for the chicken!  There is the option to sub malted waffles for the red velvet.  After discussing the waffle textures with Evelyn and hearing that others had voiced the same concerns and Evelyn saying that the batter did yield differing textures compared to malt waffles, after further bites, it dawned on me that maybe the red waffles were undercooked, so I took a photo. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-normal-tempe?select=O5-wc9LkJRySsdHLPqWxhQ#O5-wc9LkJRySsdHLPqWxhQ  I had no intention of complaining about the waffles and only showed the photo to Manager Maria during conversation when she came around, but she graciously offered to have the kitchen cook another serving for me to take home AND had this item omitted from my bill!  What amazing response, and totally unexpected!  

After finishing one of the three pieces of chicken, I pushed the plate aside and had Evelyn put in the order for the Sundae Funday. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-normal-tempe?select=7SG8gtCI1TEn_yH8wm4FRg#7SG8gtCI1TEn_yH8wm4FRg  Made with Grateful Spoon's Salted Caramel ice cream, caramel sauce and brownie bites made in-house, strawberry boba (ooh, these were fun!), and topped with a streusel (honeycomb, or caramel?), this dessert definitely lived up to its name!  Sweet and salty, with creamy ice cream and caramel sauce against dense brownies bites filled with chocolate chunks (these bites could've been chopped into smaller pieces), and then to discover that these boba balls are not the traditional kind you find in Asian milk teas and desserts.  No, no.  These boba balls POP and release strawberry liquid! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-normal-tempe?select=W2pbMX92hZ5v89Z5rD42Gg#W2pbMX92hZ5v89Z5rD42Gg  Oh, my!  With all these different textures and flavors intermingling in my mouth, this sweet treat really made for a fun-tastical experience!  

With such great ambience, a very promising menu, and personable staff working there (I also met Chef Brian, who knows Chef Jeff K), I will be returning to try other items on the menu.  In fact, I'm meeting a cousin and her boyfriend there today!

p.s.  Tapacubo, a restaurant next door serving Mexican/Latin-influenced foods, such as arepas, tacos, burritos, and other goodies, just opened the same day as my visit.  I asked Chef Brian if I, with corn and other food allergies, would be able to find something on the menu to enjoy, he said definitely.  I think it's terrific that more and more chefs and their staffs are willing to cater to ever-increasing populations of people who have allergies, and that is why I am very happy to support restaurants, such as The Normal (and soon Tapacubo), that do."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little place. Although it took a little longer than expected to get my food it was worth it. We stayed next door at the Graduate so it worked out to have breakfast here. When I come back in town I will stay at the Graduate and have a bite to eat at the Normal Diner!"}
{"text":"This diner is in the new mod style hotel called The Graduate. Apparently the site used to be an iHop but I would not have known it at all. They had it decorated really cool. It is your basic diner set up with stools at a counter and then a bunch of booths but there are a few glam touches like cool fabric patterns and light fixtures.

The menu is likewise basic diner food glammed up a bit. Hubby had a burger and fries which he said was pretty good. I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup which is always a favorite meal of mine no matter where I order it. The soup was creamy and delicious. The sandwich was made with Havarti cheese and had shredded beef brisket in it with a bbq sauce on it that really went well with the cheese. The bread was griddled so that it had the perfect crunch to it. The sauce on the beef was a bit too sweet but other than that it was really delicious. I loved the pomegranate iced tea as well... they do have some alcoholic drinks but we did not partake that evening.

By the end of the meal we were both satisfied and happy. Our server brought out the check stuck into a '50s dime store paperback novel which I thought was a cute touch. I think this is a great option for dinner before a show at Gammage (it is right across the street) and so I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"So I walk into this place, REALLY nice decor, VERY clean  they have a wall filled with 8 tracks (pretty cool). So all of this always makes me nervous because I'm normally not AT ALL impressed by decor... I'm here for the FOOD! And usually when restaurants spend this much on decor they have no money left for a decent cook or quality food. So I ordered the hash and I was a little hungry, but OMG! I felt like I was on Naked and Afraid eating the snake I just killed after going 12 straight days with no food! Ok, I'm exaggerating, but It was pretty dang good!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I celebrated my birthday with my daughter here.  The waitstaff is very attentive and knowledgeable about the nenu. I enjoyed the Farmer's market omelet with short ribs special. Tasty perfectly cooked eggs topped a short ribs in Guajillo sauce. My daughter enjoyed Eggs Benedict. Both dishes came with Poblano Roasted Potatoes. We finished with cocktails of Moscow Mule - Authentic and tasty. The decor is old school classic with a modern twist. We loved the collection of eight tracks on the main wall in the back.  I have to honesty say that this was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had in years. The location is right on the ASU campus but you feel like you could be anywhere.  I saw students and others of different ages come and go. It has a upbeat
Friendly atmosphere. Everyone around us seemed to be enjoying it as much we were. I'll be sure to return in the near future."}
{"text":"Worst service. We ordered 2 breakfasts. I had coffee; my husband just had water. There were 6 waitresses working and we were 1 of 3 tables in the restaurant eating. My husband had eaten his entire meal and no water refill. I had to flail my arm wildly to get her attention to get a coffee refill, and when I asked her for coffee, no apology for the wait. A couple minutes later another waitress came by to refill my coffee, and she was not friendly at all. Mind you, my husband's water glass is empty. Neither waitress offered to refill his water. The waitresses would congregate and chit chat rather than check on their customers. Our waitress finally came by to clear our dishes, and we asked for the check. She came back with the check rather quickly. So now that's 4 times at our table with no water refill. I asked my husband if he wanted a refill, but he said no need to bother her because we have water in our hotel room upstairs. We put our cash with tip with the check, and she took it while we were still sitting there sipping my coffee (which I thought was rude). The waitresses were friendly to each other but no smiles for the customers...not friendly at all. I got bad vibes frim all of them. The food was ok. We just ordered 2 eggs with bacon or sausage, potatoes and toast so it's pretty hard to screw that up. We ordered our eggs over easy, and they were over medium which we were okay with. $8 for each breakfast and $2.50 for the coffee so for the quality of food and service, I would not recommend this place. We added a takeout order to our bill so our check came out to $25.51. I wouldn't have given her any tip, but gave her $28. We normally give at least 20% tip, and it's rare for us to even leave just 15%, but I felt she was lucky to even get 10% from us! If it were busy, I would've excused the poor service, but 3 tables with 6 waitresses! 1 table was a single person who also wasn't being tended to, and I saw him walk over to get a waitress after sitting there for a very long time waiting for someone to come by his table. We were a table for 2, and the other table had 3 or 4 men there who were already eating when we got there. The waitresses need better training or some kind of supervision. We will never eat here again and will tell others to do the same."}
{"text":"Part of what once used to be a house of pancakes in  a hotel, off of ASU, this eating establishment has been turned into a hipper, cooler environment that is an homage to the culture of the 70s with a retro look which includes a display of 8 track tapes on the back of the eating area and framed photos of people dressed in 70s clothing. Fo those born int he 90s, which I assume is much of the current student population at ASU,this probably feels like a trip back to an earlier era.

I took my parents (who lived through the 70s, and I did as well, but as a child) as it was interesting to have an actual diner in our area. I tried the old fashioned on the menu, a bit watery but it was $6 - I would probably adjust this a bit but for a late night pancake session at the diner, probably not a bad drink and it did come with three alcohol soaked cherries. After the cocktail their is a nice selection of local beers.

As for the food, while most of it didn't wow me the grilled inked sausages were amazing and I believe they are made by a local provider. We didn't try the pancakes though and the waitress said those are especially good. What they do well with though, is the baking - I had the chocolate chip cookies with sea salt and they were amazing - comes with a glass of milk that you can also get warm (quite homey). They also bake their own pies and they change so look forward to coming back for a slice. However, they don't post the pie type on Facebook - might be a good idea to do that and have a twitter account as their pie could be their trademark as not many places I know, make their own pie, at least in this area.

As for the service, as others have mentioned, a bit more laid back than it should be. The wait staff may want to be a bit more on top of cleaning dirty dishes off the table and checking on empty glasses. I think that is a training issue more than anything else. i also like that they have a daily special - so that provides something new to the mix. Final thought - have a weekly newsletter of upcoming specials and pies - it would not cost much and helps to develop a following and of course, work on the cocktails - raise the bar (pun intended) on them a bit and I think this place will be headed in the right direction."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced. Waited 15 minutes to sit in a half-empty dining room. Waited 40 minutes for a cold, average meal. Potatoes are the size and texture of chicken feed, and are cooked in large batches every 16 years. Benedict was a hard-boiled egg. 

After surviving a twilight-zone experience at the sister-restaurant Tapacubo - a concept seemingly designed by and for the mentally ill - I don't know why I gave this place a shot, and I feel like a ninny.

Positives:
Bread was good.
Decor has no shortage of cute ideas."}
{"text":"High quality breakfast, attentive service, groovy atmosphere.  I ordered the Blackboard special, an egg white spinach and Swiss frittata and the wife had the Farmers Omelette which is egg white, goat cheese and fresh veggies.  Both came with real potatoes.  Some real TLC in the food prep.  If you're looking for a greasy spoon this isn't it.  However if you're looking for healthy eating, fresh ingredients, I recommend The Normal."}
{"text":"This place is really cute on the inside and has totally transformed from the ihop it was before. The menu is eclectic and has breakfast all day (plus!). I ended up going with the after school special which consisted of a bbq brisket grilled cheese and tomato soup. It was very good and the bbq sauce wasn't over powering. The sandwich and soup actually went really well together. 
Hubs got the bison burger and said it was ok. 
I unlocked the offer for a free coffee and got a latte. I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it as the coffee wasn't that great and came out slightly warmed. 
Overall it's a cute place and I would go back and try a breakfast item."}
{"text":"Come here!!!!! I had never had a grilled cheese in my life, and it was amazing!!!! Cheap (in a good way) champagne. I also heard the coffee and donuts are amazing. Not my hood, but will definitely come back to try the red velvet waffles! Also, our waiter was amazing! The atmosphere was amazing! I hope this place picks up business, it really deserves it."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for work and my long day of meetings started with a breakfast one here at the The Normal diner. The place had good food and great service. I had the breakfast sandwich, which was good. But the truly delicious eats are the donuts, especially the bacon maple one!!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. It is a great place to have dinner before a Gammage event.

Don't let the outside appearance fool you. It is tastefully decorated inside and a great place to relax."}
{"text":"ATe breakfast there for the second time: it took 45 minutes to get bacon, eggs and pancakes for two.  Service is B team and consists of someone saying they are sorry for dirty plates, tough pancakes and a long wait.  Wont be back, they need a manager and some real waitstaff, along with a short order cook."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, it was nothing special to rave about though. We were recommended this place from an older couple who was visiting here from out of town. Anyway, the food is over priced for what it actually is the portions are small as well. Our server Taylor was terrible, she seemed annoyed every time she came to our table. My 3 year old daughter loves to order her meal herself but is quiet about it sometimes, well Taylor just seemed irritated that I allowed my child to do so. She was not tentative to our drinks, our waters were empty for 20 minutes and we had to ask for refills. As we were walking out to leave, the manager was at the host stand, she saw us smiled a half smile and didnt even thank us for coming in or say have a nice day. All in all, we will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Retro Diner with Pothead ideas for food!!! Highly recommend the cereal killer!!!"}
{"text":"With so many great breakfast places in Tempe, why go here?   I live close by and decided to give them another try.  I really wish the the hotel's bar was better and this restaurant was even ok.   The omelette took forever and there was a sprinkle of cheese inside.  Actually, more cheese ended up on the plate than in the eggs.  The brisket was more like beef jerky.  Hash browns had a mysterious taste almost like goat cheese and looked a like someone pushed a spoon into them in various places.  It fails as a diner and as an elevated breakfast joint.  My advice....avoid.  If you are staying at the hotel, get a shuttle to one of the other many places in Tempe."}
{"text":"Most horrible service I have EVER had anywhere.  I am a Postmate courier and because I am with Postmates I'm being told that my order gets placed behind all in house orders. Beyond ridiculous because I already waited 20 minutes to place a to go order. Then I have to wait even longer. Not only is this a disservice to my customers but to me. The longer I wait, the longer it takes for me to move on to another job, which results in me making less money. I have come here as a direct customer several times. I will not be back. I also will be rejecting any Postmates requests for this establishment from here on out. I really don't get it. Our customers are your customers, they are paying for your product, they assist in keeping you in business and you treat them as if they are less than others. It's bad."}
{"text":"I stayed at the hotel 3 days for a business trip. The sponsor covered my lodging and meals, forcing me to eat the free meals at the Normal and Tapacubo. Each meal was death. This is an overall review of 8 meals. 

The Normal: watery salsa, eggs not fully cooked, parfait warm and watery, granola stale, bacon raw, flavorless diner coffee, toast burnt to a crisp on one side, the hash pork shoulder way drier than this godforsaken desert wasteland. Bring a good book if you come here, it'll be 30 minutes before you'll get water of place an order, then another 30 to get food. Everything overpriced

Tapacubo: veggie flautas were absolute death....I gagged...the veggies were unidentifiable, the steak in the tacos and tortas have the texture of a pencil eraser, salsa watery and flavorless, quesadilla was mediocre but cold, the small cup of guacamole was okay, but not good enough to be 8.50. Service terrible. I reached over the bar counter to refill my own water. 

Graduate Tempe: when attempting to check in, they said room would be ready shortly. Translated, that means take a two hour nap on the lobby couch. Sink didn't drain properly. Cable was out. 

Save yourself....keep driving."}
{"text":"Service was strange. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes even though there were many available tables. When we got our coffees from the bar (as suggested by the waitress that greeted us), we were approached to be seated. A little weird. 

We sat for a while until someone finally came to get our orders. I got the Fat Hen Sandwich and my boyfriend got the Hash. My sandwich was delicious. The meat was so tender. Whatever sauce they used on the bun was a little sweet and it matched perfectly with the brisket. 

My boyfriend was impressed with his hash too. Real hash! None of that canned stuff here. 

We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I stopped in today, as I have a few times before, to have a cup of coffee. I decided I wanted some pie and juice. How difficult is it to have fresh squeezed juice? Apparently, impossible for you guys.

I, once again, as in the past, asked what pies you had available, to no success. Again, you only had some Apple crumble, which was dry and disgraceful. If you're going to serve pie, do it right or leave it off the blackboard. Denny's has you hand over fist on good diner food. Food and good food is what brings people in. You have work to do before I will ever step into your place again. Don't rest on your laurels just because you're near ASU and Gammage. Your food is lackluster if that."}
{"text":"Great diner. The menu is a bit limited, but the options are delicious and they seem to make an effort to be relatively healthy."}
{"text":"This diner doesn't look like much from the road, was a IHOP until a few years ago. The menu had limited choices, and many of the choices did not appeal tone. I ordered a simple eggs, sausage, potatoes and toast. The service from pretty Ashlee was great. The food was absolutely outstanding. I wish the menu was more extensive, but what they do make is first class."}
{"text":"Cute and hip diner! The staff is friendly and provides excellent service. 5/5

As for the food, it was good but NOT that good to be paying that much. I think the food is a little pricey for something you can get at U.S. Egg or an IHOP in my opinion. Good, but might not be returning.

Note: if you do try this place out, get the cereal milkshake"}
{"text":"I hate giving this a bad review, I really do but...ewww. My friend and I both had the red velvet waffles and chicken. I was so excited because I love chicken and waffles. It was so disgusting. I am still having to stifle the urge to gag when I think about what the chicken looked like underneath the fried goodness. It was largely gristle and it was all dark brown meat. I have never had fried chicken and waffles and had it not be white meat so I guess I never thought to ask. My friend's was white so for her it was a great experience but for me I am still nauseated hours later.

ALSO the restaurant was so warm that our server had sweat spots covering the underneath of her arms. Had I not been wearing black I probably would have showing signs of how hot I was too. I know my hair was killed before the show at gammage.

The restaurant is cute. But you gotta work on the food and ac. for realzzzzzz.

I miss ihop. They used the ac AND I was never fed grizzle."}
{"text":"I had the gringo burrito but substituted the chorizo with the brisket... it was amazing! I definitely recommend this place and will be back. The staff was very attentive to me, not just my waitress. It was nice to see staff working together... GREAT JOB LADIES!"}
{"text":"We waited a little longer than comfortable to be seated this Sunday morning. However the food is really really good. We had the hash (warning: super spicy delish dish), quiche (yum, needed hot sauce, perfect crust), half order of excellent cheddar biscuits/gravy, and side of tender belly sausage. Cameron our server apparently thought we only needed one cup of coffee, even though we asked for refills twice. Still waiting as I write this in fact. Waiting. Oh! Here he is and now I am taking my refill of coffee to go. Great food, service needs work."}
{"text":"This started out so promising-- the location, the decor, and the service was so great (madi).The food was utterly bland. I got the hash...with a guajillo sauce. It was so incredibly under seasoned. My wife's biscuit sandwich with sriracha aioli was unimpressive. The biscuit to toppings ratio was way too much biscuit, which could of been fine had the biscuit been moist/fresh. I love breakfast and others have said this place was great. Also got the red velvet waffle, which to be fair, was pretty good. 

The place was dead 11:30 on a Wednesday and maybe that was part of it. But for the love of food, taste your short ribs!

Not sure if I'd give this another chance. Bummer."}
{"text":"My party of six went to The Normal Diner for a light bite after a recent concert at ASU.  It was only 10pm and there were maybe 10 other people in this huge diner, but we had some of the slowest service I have ever experienced.  The lone waitress stood less than 10 feet from us, doing something on her computer (cashing out, entering tickets, etc.)  Said \"I'll be right with you\" twice, kept on doing her thing.  FINALLY a manager(?) brought water, then menus.  We were eventually able to order:  coffee, tea, fries, a shake, a piece of pie and a breakfast burrito.  It all came out slowly & at different times.  I admit that the burrito was delicious and the right temperature, but the experience had lost its luster by that time.  The place is cute, but maybe it's better during the rush when the staff's adrenaline is coursing through their veins, but late night - not so much."}
{"text":"They staff here are really great and accommodating. There's an amazing selection of main dishes, beverages and baked goods. I wanted to try it all. Went in the evening. 

I went with a hamburger and fries. The steak fries were a little soft unfortunately. The burger had a cool croissant bun but I wish they toasted it more because it made my burger soggy, which was a little pink although I asked for medium well, I'm assuming I'd have to ask for well done to be medium... 

I tried the house coffee black, which was excellent, and Noreo house made oreo, was like a sugar cookie without sugar and cream paste, was really cold after sitting out, but dipping in coffee helped. Although I still didn't like it. I used the check in yelp deal which I was told they had never heard of... 

The wait staff asked if we were good, refills, whatever, but the male at the bakery counter was kind of rude and matter of factly. The woman I'm assuming is the manager was lovely, very kind woman, there were also fire fighters taking care of an elderly man who seemed to have been there before so that was nice of the restaurant. 

I look forward to trying their refined drinks, they have a lot of older drinks I'd think young people aren't familiar with which impressed me for an ASU area establishment ."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast here on Sunday with two friends, and frankly it was disappointing. I have been here before and had a great experience, so I was excited to introduce it to my friends. However, we were seated and no one acknowledged us for fifteen minutes. Finally Rayne came over and was completely adorable. Unfortunately this adorableness wore off quickly, when it took her fifty (yes, 5-0) minutes to bring us water. We were ten feet from her the majority of the time and she kept making eye contact, and even came over four separate times to say \"oh no! I forgot your water again!\" And then failed to bring it...again. Our food took an hour and twenty minutes to arrive, and we waited over thirty minutes for cups of coffee...still without water. Rayne didn't know the menu well, and kept coming back to say that they don't carry things we had ordered and she had told us about. Also my friend has an allergy to cheese, and when the food arrived, Rayne asked her to check her food to make sure there was no cheese... All three of us work at a restaurant together, and we are very kind to those in the service industry. But frankly, this was ridiculous. If there was cheese, would we have been waiting another hour for a cheese-less omelette?
Food was okay, not worth the wait at all. There were tons of empty tables, but people were stuck waiting for 20+ minutes for a table. I won't return, sadly."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have always wanted to come in and try the diner. Unfortunately, my experience was the worst I've ever had at any dining establishment. 

First off, I waited around 5 or more minutes to be acknowledged and seated. There was a woman waiting ahead of me who seemed to be getting impatient for the wait as well, and when the hostess finally acknowledged her the lady stated she simply just wanted a coffee. I should have just left at that point since The Normal can't even host/acknowledge guests appropriately. 

I had not even sat down yet when the server asked me what I wanted to eat. I don't know??? I've never been there before and hadn't even looked at the menu yet. I decided to order The Fit which sounded really simple,  just egg whites, tomatoes, avocado and sausage. I also ordered a side of the hash browns. $13. (Pictured) 

The egg whites/avocado/tomato were fine. The sausage was inedible and tasted awful. It tasted like the frozen sausage patties that they would serve in public schools for breakfast, but worse. They were dry.  The hash browns were hard and cold by the time they got to my table. Would have tasted better if they were warmer or not dried out. Oh well ?. I wasn't surprised with the food at that point.  

I still had 70% of the food on my plate when the server asked me \"are you done?\" I was kind of taken back when she asked me that because I still had quite of bit of food on my plate, so I told her no,  but would like the check. 

After waiting for a long time and then being rushed through my meal, I will not be coming back here. I can liv with the food being mediocre but the service was disappointing. Even if I was a guest at the graduate, I would much rather walk through the ASU campus and hit up Snooze or Ncounter for better food and experience."}
{"text":"Celiacs beware of the Normal Diner.  The cooks here think that a gluten-free sandwich means you put it on a vegan wheat flour tortilla instead of white bread. Even after I sent the sandwich back with a question, they insisted it was gluten-free and safe--until I had them show me the package in which the tortillas came.  If the cooking staff is that clueless or that cavalier about food intolerances or allergies, it's really gotta make you wonder what else you might have to worry about if you ate here."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. The fried potatoes were delicious, everything else was sub-par. Servers were nice and the location was convenient for us but the food took a long time to come out and simply wasn't good when it finally did come out."}
{"text":"Great bar with fun ambience.  Nicole was great, and was awesome.  We loved the darts, pool and great patio."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere, and friendly staff. Waited a while for refills and check, everything else made up for that. I love then change, the Ihop needed to go!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things about the waitstaff. Madi and Katee were terrific. They deserve a raise. Menu isn't very big, so if you're staying for more than a few days it will get old. My biggest problem is that A- they don't have a phone number to call ahead or for take out orders. You get the front desk of the hotel and they can't connect you. B- nly greens for a salad are lettuce. They have kale for a smoothie but no kale salad. No good salads here."}
{"text":"Not super happy with service. A slow Saturday morning but my waitress was nowhere to be found most of my breakfast. Asked for a to-go cup of coffee 15 minutes before I got my check, paid my check and sat at my table waiting for my coffee but it never came. Got up to leave and found my waitress, and then was told it would be a wait on be coffee because they were brewing more. Left without my coffee because I had already waited 20 minutes at this point for it. Not a huge deal but overall a disappointing experience. Food was good, but the bad service made it frustrating."}
{"text":"Really great place.  I think they opened recently and are still getting their sea legs, but I see success.  The prices seem high, but the food is worth it.  There is SKILL in the menu.  The service is friendly and genuine.   The only thing I would encourage is 1 or 2 things for kids....but I'll be back.  Several times.  Probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for five minutes no one said a word to me. Got my stuff and left the hostess didn't even say thank you or anything as I left. We're staying at a buddies house close to here he said it wasn't good but it was the closest option we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Malted Waffles.
OMG

No need to even order a meal; just get all the must-haves separate. If you do, the Minimum Wage Meal is the way to go.
So good, we love coming here for brunch. 
Dog friendly patio, bonus!
Nice friendly staff, can get busy on the weekends but that's Normal, get it?

Malted Waffles.
Mind Blown"}
{"text":"Their \"spicy\" Bison burger has no kick at all, the spicy ketchup at Whataburger has more heat. Only really had cheese, meat and sauce on a bun, nothing else. It's was a very meh burger at a higher price of other really good burger places close by. All the stuff on their menu was overpriced. I'd pass on this place."}
{"text":"The staff here was incredibly friendly right off the bat. They made several recommendations, including the fat hen sandwich (awesome), quinoa salad and hash. I also had the half wedge salad with green goddess dressing. Highly recommended. 

If I had one negative thing to say, it would be that the stools at the bar don't have footrests, so if you're of a total normal height of 5'8\" like myself, sitting there can be uncomfortable. Head for a table instead. 

As I sit here writing this review, our server just dropped off complimentary (and delicious!) sugar cookies with the check. 

Like Schwarzenegger in Teriminator 5, I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had the hash (both of us ordered the same thing) with poached eggs!  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  A cool, fun place to eat.  Loved that we could order breakfast for dinner.  Not expensive.  Worth it!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this diner!  The wall of old 8 tracks somehow worked here - lol - cool to see some of the covers.  You gotta say \"right on\" to the Chicken n Red Velvet Waffles!   I got \"The Hash\" - it was pretty good.  What I would absolutely be back for is the pressed juice (Had a Yelp check-in for buy one get one free!) - \"The big Liverbowski\" - 2 thumbs up!  It's definitely got some healing powers."}
{"text":"Meh, pretty...normal experience. I came here with some friends and we sat outside, the ambiance is pretty cool, like a school hangout/diner feel. They had a grilled cheese that I had to get my paws on (minus the pulled pork or whatever was in the sandwich, idk how I feel about that), they messed up the order twice and I ended up with a free sandwich with the sandwich I already bought but maybe they were having an off day. The food was nothing to write home about but I guess the restaurant is aptly named."}
{"text":"Service was slow, the french toast was underwhelming. The only positive things was the cute decor and the cheese curds. It's just a okay place for Brunch."}
{"text":"First visit to The Normal was very promising. For those of you who are new to Arizona, ASU was previously known as Tempe Normal. Thus, the name. Love it. Located at the newly remodeled hotel now known as the Graduate. Love that name as well. Great location near Gammage Auditorium and the W.P. Carey School of Business.

The restaurant has been nicely redone. No evidence that it was once an IHOP. A kind of retro feel. Very welcoming. Very friendly server who helped the vegetarian with whom I was dining maneuver the menu. We sat in place for a long time after our meal and felt no pressure to vacate our booth. Loved the use of vintage Western paperbacks to deliver the tab.

Greeted promptly when we entered. Seated immediately. Offered beverages. Order taken the moment we were ready. Yes, perhaps evidence of a three week old restaurant with employees who are trying hard to please, but I sensed it might be sustainable. I was a little concerned The Normal might be positioned to become just another bad hotel restaurant.  Happily, this does not seem to be the case.

We only sampled two items. The burrito, modified for a vegetarian pallet, was excellent. The blue corn pancakes were unique. I would order them again, but they were a bit much by themselves and I would consider splitting entrees with a friend next time. I mentioned on a comment card that some color on the plate, perhaps just a slice of orange or the like, would help with its presentation and could break the taste. We appreciated The Normal's emphasis on sourcing locally...

Not priced for starving students. Not too high priced. Just a little. The folks dining at The Normal this night appeared to be local, not captive hotel guests, which was nice.

Five stars. While the food and surroundings were nice, it was the high level of customer service that made the difference."}
{"text":"Menu is small but the meals are great. Unique pairing of foods. Service is great and the diner is immaculate."}
{"text":"don't get me wrong, the food at this place is exceptional, but between the uninspired service and ice box air conditioning I couldn't enjoy my quiche.

After finding something reasonably priced on the menu from hell (chicken and waffles is $12.50!), I did enjoy it. Would I come back???? if they got a new wait staff, redid the decor and readjusted their prices back to reality. Sure, then I'd come back."}
{"text":"This place has potential for so much more on a Sunday morning. I love everything about it. Although it feels like Beck and Wes Anderson designed the interior along with the menu. I hope to see more people inside with bottomless mimosas and a dj playing some tunes. However it's not a breakfast spot but more brunch."}
{"text":"The food was very good. Maybe some of the best diner food that I have ever had. The biscuits and gravy was the most delicious thing ever! The staff was a little slow and so we had to wait for a long time for the food due to the lack of employees working. However overall the experience and food was great!"}
{"text":"One word comes to mind when thinking about the food here.... AMAZING! I have not had a meal other then spectacular in the 5-7 times I've been here. Meals are good old fashioned home cooking with some modern twists! I look forward to every visit here!"}
{"text":"Just tried this diner and cannot believe I did not know about it before. Atmosphere is great really done well. It's a big place has lots of tables so be great for study groups. I went for lunch had a burger it was good. I checked out the rest the place it's pretty cool. Go into the lobby and see how nicely decorated it is. Also they have a taco bar restaurant that opens up to a pool and if you eat there you get to swim for free kind of cool. They also have a bar on the top of the hotel which I had no idea about an outside bar. One other thing that's pretty great also is they have free parking for their patrons which is hard to find in Tempe and lots of it. They also have a coffee bar in the restaurant. It's like a Starbucks kind of bar."}
{"text":"This place is nice. Great food, service, very clean. I will definitely come back. It is located right across ASU."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow!


Ok, that isn't all I can say, but wow, this place was extremely good, especially for a brand new restaurant. They already have it together. The decor of this restaurant is cute, they have a wall covered in 8 tracks and everything has a 70's vibe. I said the bathroom was like the Jetsons because it is decorated with 70's flair, but has all modern technology (I don't think I had to touch a handle or button in the place...). 

More importantly, the food was very good and made with local ingredients. I had the breakfast sandwich (at the waitress's recommendation, go waitress!) and it was pretty fabulous. Melt in your mouth short rib that is bursting with flavor served with an over easy egg (that's the way it comes! I know!), tomato jam for a savory and slightly sweet touch, all served on a soft sweet bun. Absolutely wonderful! It came with a small portion of nicely cooked potatoes with peppers and onions (which were especially good when put on the sandwich). The husband had the pancakes, which tasted homemade.... and not 'homemade' from a box. The portion was huge, 3 giant pancakes... he couldn't finish them. 

Service was good, though the waitress couldn't tell me what kind of coffee they use (it was pretty good, though) and asked if we wanted cream, 1/2 and 1/2 or milk.... we said cream and got milk (ha!), but little things like that will get ironed out I'm sure. The prices here were fairly steep, breakfast was over 30$ with tax and tip, but the quality warranted (to some degree) the price (plus they bring out the check inside of an old book.... that definitely softens the blow of the price, ha!). 

I can't wait to come back and try their other menu items, including lunch and late night!!"}
{"text":"This retro diner is beautiful inside and the menu has great selections but the actual food was meh. I ordered the minimum wage breakfast, which is the classic bacon, eggs and toast. The bacon was overdone and cold. The scrambled eggs and toast were okay. The drip coffee was weak. Overall disappointing. I might meet friends for a drink but pass on the food."}
{"text":"A pretty solid breakfast option, especially if you're staying at the neighboring Graduate hotel. My large group of thirteen had no trouble finding seats for breakfast on two consecutive weekday mornings during Spring Training. 

For me, the standout on their menu is the Gringo Burrito. I usually have an aversion to anything in burrito form until after noon, but the mouthwatering description of chorizo, yukon potatoes, white cheddar, spinach, salsa verde, and eggs in a fresh warm tortilla was like a siren call to my stomach. On my second visit I ordered the minimum wage breakfast -  a well-rounded, classic breakfast dish hat didn't live up to the burrito. I should have gone gringo twice. 

the service was on point as well considering we took the place by storm when they were otherwise almost empty. Any spot that brings out the food for a party our size hot and on time is on its game."}
{"text":"Normal diner environment but nothing normal about the food!! It was delicious and you have to try the bloody Mary, the little mini slider was yummy! A little pricey but worth every penny!! We went around 11am on a Monday it was very chill and our waitress Leah was very tentative and polite. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with The Normal Cafe, especially since it's attached to a hotel (The Graduate Hotel). The location is perfect though if you're doing anything at ASU or at the theater since both are across the street.

I went in expecting the food to be a little overpriced (it's attached to a hotel) and to be subpar, but was pleasantly surprised to find out that the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable.

The portions are all pretty massive -- and the chicken and waffles is a pretty awesome option since it comes with red velvet waffles. (Wow!) I had a little bit of that, and then also had some eggs and bacon to myself. 

I would definitely recommend the chicken and red velvet waffles. I think next time I'll need to try some of their lunch sandwiches though."}
{"text":"After my sister heavily recommended over time cause of the good food my wife and 2 kids finally went for it (bypassing our current favorite Snooze).  After 10-15 minutes at our table with zero service, no acknowledgement, not even a glance, we walked.  Sorry but we tried."}
{"text":"My mom and I saw Wicked last night and had dinner here before the show. As I walked in there was a super nice lady going out as I came in and she welcomed me in and came by our table a couple times to check on things so I'm assuming she was the manager/owner. Super sweet and I really loved the fact that she was actually working! Kaitee was our server and she was fantastic as well. We never needed anything as she was totally on top of it. We started of with fried cheese curds but they were totally overcooked as there was literally, absolutely  no cheese inside. I had the grilled cheese and brisket sandwich with the homemade tomato soup. Soup was lukewarm but great and there was way too much sauce on the brisket. It overpowered the havarti and sourdough bread. Mom had the turkey avocado sandwich with soup and enjoyed it. Kaitee offered us dessert and we ordered the salted carmel ice cream, which it turned out  they were out of but she got us some vanilla bean with homemade carmel sauce. Delicious! The decor was cute and the check presenter was a book which I thought totally fit the theme of the restaurant. Overall, it was a great experience and I'll definitely go back....possibly  when I go see the Book of Mormon!"}
{"text":"Nice, diner style café that offers a good selection of breakfast options. The coffee was very good with plenty of refills offered. It was a good bright location to get a few hours of work done. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Can't get enough! I love this place, every time I'm in I get awesome service and outstanding food!! I've brought some family in from out of town and we had so much fun, the server Madi answered all our questions and never let my coffee get empty! I would 100% recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun unique breakfast without the crazy \"brunch\" lines at other places. I really appreciate the in-complicated menu, I need to go back and try the fruity pebble French toast it looked amazing!! 

If you haven't been yet then I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The interior design is really great and I love it but when it comes to food, I was quite disappointed. First off, there wasn't much selection in what you can order. We ordered the minimum wage breakfast and the eggs benedict. I felt that the food was overpriced and the service we received was not great. We kept asking for our waters to be refilled and we waited for our food for quite a time. Overall it was an ok normal breakfast experience, nothing special."}
{"text":"The Normal is one of my favorite places to get breakfast in Tempe. After Ncounter's food went downhill, The Normal was there for me. I always get the minimum wage meal because it's perfect so I can't speak to much else of the menu (wait I tried the milkshakes once and those are, of course, amazing), but the minimum wage meal is perfect. They put jalapenos in the potatoes and that might not be your thing, but it's definitely mine. Two non-food or service things that make The Normal perfect: it has its own parking lot and it's almost never busy."}
{"text":"Got the kale quinoa salad. Dramatically under proportioned for a $10 salad. It was a good salad with dried blueberries and somewhat under-ripened cherry tomatoes, but I feel like the extra taste sensation brought from the yummy bits was overshadowed by the fact that I'm still hungry. For 10 bucks I shouldn't still be hungry. Even if it's a salad."}
{"text":"Fun diner with a great location and good comfort food. We went here before a show at Gammage- it's right across the street. It wasn't too full when we arrived but got busier as it got later. We had a good server who suited this friendly diner. We ordered the meatloaf which had a zingy bbq sauce on it. I normally don't like bbq sauce but this was fantastic. We also had the fried chicken with gravy - delicious  -and a blackboard special of chicken tacos- again a really tasty meal. It had nice fresh cabbage and a sauce on the tacos and a generous serving of shredded chicken. Because we had time to kill before our show we ordered dessert- the cookies and milk are like a taste of home from childhood.  They even have 8 track tapes on the wall! We are talking about this place!"}
{"text":"It's incredible that this place manages to stay in business. We were staying at the hotel with no rental car, so we gave this place several chances to make a good impression. Who would pay $9 for an order of pancakes that costs a few cents to make? They're among the cheapest ingredients on the planet! The burger tasted like one of those horrible pre-formed patties you can buy at Walmart, and the fries were obviously frozen. In fact, I'm not sure anything there would qualify as homemade. They have this \"honey butter\" that they serve you when you get toast, and it tastes horrendous. The best way to describe it: it tastes like whipped rancid oil. All of the waitresses, with only one exception, didn't care about their job or their customers. They never think to offer drink refills, and if you ask for them, you may or may not get them, but expect to wait at least 15 minutes if you do. How did they manage to find an entire team of inadequate wait staff? Do they make sure during the interview process that each one possesses a lackidaisical attitude?? The only good thing I can say is that their coffee is strong, which is a rare find."}
{"text":"We've experienced the Normal 3 different times now and the experience has been consistent. We want to love and embrace this as our community go to for breakfast but they do have a little work to do. Given that Tempe now has so many great places to choose from, I feel that there is some improvement to be made. The patio is lacking aesthetically, a little cold given that they aren't seeing the sunshine through in that area. Some plants, pops of color, music & heat lamps could really make that area nice. They also have a coffee window (my favorite part) but is not inviting at all. The window is never open, when they take your order it slams shut and there is an itty bitty counter. Coffee is decent - I'm sure this will improve as they get their legs underneath them. Overall it's decent & I'm confident it will get better. The best part is the food. Great selection & prices, everything has been fresh. Very friendly staff! Patio is dog friendly too!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars - Yelp we need half star options. 


3 for food 
4 for ambiance

Wow, this place has come a long way since it was a HoJos and we used to sneak in from the ASU dorms circuit 1983 to use the pool. Shhhh, did I say that out loud? 

I was lucky enough to visit this place twice last week. Once to eat before the show at Gammage. They give a same day discount which I did not even know about. A few days later I visited the hotel for a cocktail reception on the rooftop which got rained out. The reception was rescheduled to the conference room. We did end up on the rooftop later that night after the rain stopped. ( lovely view) 


The Normal diner is pretty funky and retro. I love what they did with it. The food is average but an upgraded, funky kind of diner food. Nothing to write home about but not bad either. I had a Cajun chicken sandwich which was okay. The fries however, were cold and not great. At the reception I did have their red velvet waffles and fried chicken and they were actually very good. These are also on the Normal's menu thus why I mention it. 

The gals working here are the best. Young and students of course. Go Sundevils. 


I might add on show nights you might want to get there very early. I was busy reading and eating and did not notice about an hour before curtain time people were eyeing my table, and me, like hungry Zombies. By the time I had arrived to find an empty restaurant to the time I looked up from my meal and great book the restaurant was packed.  

Speaking of books. They attach the bill to a book. LOl and yeah! I adore that idea. 

I want to go back to try all their drinks, treaties and other food items. Not bad. Check it out."}
{"text":"Would have never gone here if it was not for word of mouth from a few friends.

This location  used to be a Howard Johnson's Hotel and cafe for as long as I can remember.

Not striking restaurant decor but better than Howard Johnsons. Don't know what to think of the 8 track tape wall.

We ordered the Hash, Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles and French Toast.
All 3 were excellent and prepared with very nice presentation.

The Hash is actually Braised Beef Short Rib, Roasted Potatoes in Guajillo Chile Sauce topped with 2 eggs which was prepared perfectly.

The Chicken and Red Velvet Waffles came out looking like the chicken was over cooked but was actually pretty good.

The French Toast was prepared very well with the Meditera Baked House Brioche with Carmelized Bananas.

We were in a hurry so the waitress helped us get in and out in a timely manner.

The billed was tucked in an old paper back book.

The restaurant definitely uses good quality ingredients and serves high quality food.

Will be back to try other dishes and keep some of the ones we tried.

Thanks The Normal Diner - Bon Appétit"}
{"text":"Definitely a try! Went for Breakfast food so I can't compare it to many others, but an improvement over other breakfast joints.  More expensive than a Denny's or IHOP, but more quality variety."}
{"text":"Third time I've tried to get coffee or food here. Third time with no hostess or servers present. Spoke to someone in the kitchen and asked if we could be helped. They said they would find someone. No one came out to help me or the three other people waiting in line. We all left. Unacceptable."}
