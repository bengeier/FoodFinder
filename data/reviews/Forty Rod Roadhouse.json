{"text":"this would've been a good bar if it was about 2/3 of its size; as it is its just a big, boxy, personality-less bar w/no atmosphere at all. Some of the biggest complaints: 1) it stinks!....they've yet to fix the problem of the kitchen grease smell just PERMEATING the entire place, so you smell like the great combination of stale smoke and old grease. 2) the service has always been slow and a crapshoot at best...even at the bar, the bartenders spend most of the time chatting... 3) the bar area itself is crappy, WAY to big a bar, way to wide, bartenders feel like they're a mile away from you 4)BIGGEST complaint is the crowd it attracts; the same druggy/barfighting crowd that turned Big Al's on Albermarle into a no-go has migrated over here..at 1AM the place is full of people who look like they'd either slit your throat or try and sell you an 8-ball..and they keep letting these people back in week after week  bottom line. what could have been a great sports bar isn't...too dicey a clientele, too little personality, not great service...a recipe for a place not to go"}
{"text":"Went to this place last night and it was pretty bottom of the barrel. I've actually been to the location 3-4 times and even when it was whatever previous incarnation it had been before (Wallace something or other?) every time hoping it will be more fun but every time leaving let down. Anyways, it's laid out as well as can be expected with a patio outside on the front, bar just inside, dart boards and pool tables etc. They had a DJ playing and he was spinning the best mix of \"nothing really good\" there is to be had. The wait staff appeared to consist of 3 girls, 1 bartending, 2 running orders, and they were pretty much the only ladies in the joint. May have been about 15 people total in there. The drink specials, 2-3$ for beer and 5$ royal flush shots, weren't all that special but seemed to be in line with most places. It's kinda funny but it's almost hard to explain why this place is a downer. The crowd it seems to draw are people who are there to get drunk and not so much as to have a good time if that makes any sense? Anyways, if you are in the mood to drink some moderately priced drinks in a \"no fun zone\" type place then check it out otherwise I'd say just pass it on by. I haven't tried the food so no comment on that score."}
{"text":"This is your local dive bar. No special drinks. This place is where you'd go for a beer and watch a game on the TV. They have a good number of pool tables and a shuffle board. Don't know how their food is but I wouldn't really want to try it by the looks of this place..."}
{"text":"Went last weekend with some friends to see a band they like.  Ugh !! The little bartender with the greasy hair was very rude, the manager actually asked the band to turn the volume down.  Now I dont like really loud music, but I thought the volume was good, you could hear the band but still talk.  The crowd was interesting is all I\"m going to say.  People please dont use the pictures on the website cause the pictures look nothing like they show."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone on here, I went once last year because it was new to me and I wanted to try something different.  I actually ordered my food to go and I guess I should have checked it before I left.  But once I got home everything was wrong, I called so they could fix it and they did.  The wait was crazy long, and it wasn't that many people in there the food was anything but good, I will never go again.  They even gave me free certificates and tokens to come back, and that didn't entice me enough to return."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Caveman's - mostly because the Charlotte area is a bit lacking in a decent sports bar (see earlier reviews of BW3 and Jillian's).  The location isn't the best - just another spot in a strip mall in Mint Hill.  Inside isn't bad, pretty open, with perhaps a dozen flat-screens (and they are LCD/plasma, not projection, which is nice) as well as six pool tables and darts.  While some people were smoking, the filtration seemed to be good, because it didn't seem overwhelming.  A number of patrons - mostly Pittsburgh Steelers fans - hung out at the bar, while fans of other teams were scattered about the rest of the room.  Those at the bar seemed to have the best service, as while there are servers, the service is pretty slow - both for drinks and food.  The good news is that there are a number of televisions, so you can watch all the games - if you can get the servers to turn them to the channels you want.  We asked to turn an unused screen to another channel and it took some doing.  Also, the large screen in the corner was for some reason unavailable.  Unfortunately the food wasn't good.  The fried stuff was the highlight - onion rings and homemade potato chips.  But the sandwiches were average at best.  So for drinking and watching the game, it's not bad - but you're probably best at the bar.  Just don't go for the food."}
