{"text":"I like it for breakfast. Servers are sometimes a little bossy. In a good way - if they don't like what you're asking for they let you know what's good."}
{"text":"The biggest impression this restaurant's going to make on you comes from its decor.  The walls are covered in some sort of period art that looks like a mix between the 90's and the 40's.  Lots of manufactured curves, metallic colors, and straight lines.  Even the salad bowls get in on the act.  Kind of space-age without the space suit.  The lunch menu revolves (perhaps.. orbits?) around melts.  Honestly, they're kind of expensive.  I didn't want to make my boss pay for one.  Instead I had the cheeseburger deluxe.  Nothing deluxe about this cheeseburger.  You'll get comparable size and taste at the local Wendy's.  However, my coworker's steak salad was HUGE.  I think you may get twice the food for the same price.  The service is friendly and efficient.  Not long to wait for our orders, but nothing special either."}
{"text":"Met a friend for breakfast here. Service was good. It is an Eat n Park / Denny's type of place so if you enjoy those kinds of places you will love Drew's.. I ordered the farmers omelette and my friend had the Corned Beef Hash and eggs. The big plate full of CBH was made from scratch and not canned. Delicious per my friend. My omelette was ok... Because it was the farmers and had some potatoes in it I did not receive any hash browns just a couple of slices of small toast. A great place would have included some fresh fruit to fill the platter but not Drew's just a small burrito sized omelette in the middle of a big platter.."}
{"text":"Was in and out in less than 30 mins. Had seafood bisque and a cheeseburger. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"I love Drew's! My husband and I have been coming to Drew's for quite a while now. The service and food are awesome! You can't go wrong eating here. Almost everything is homemade, including the salad dressings. They always have a nice selection of daily specials including 2 different soups. I especially love their lentil soup. Also, they have the best chicken fingers. They are hand cut and freshly breaded. So yummy! The breakfast fare is just as tasty with homemade pancakes, french toast and belgian waffles. Their desserts are to die for as well. When passing through the Forest Hills area, stop in to Drew's. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great experience on Greek night Saturday. Drew's served the best lamb I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I've been to Drew's several times, and have always been very satisfied there. The service  has been warm and friendly, and kindness and patience are rewarded in turn.  As for food, the pizza has a wonderful crust and it tastes like a real labor of love. The pancakes, waffles, french toast, and omelets are all very good.  The newer daily specials and side dish vegetables are especially nice for dinner.   As an archetypal diner and family restaurant Drew's doesn't have a ton of options for people with dietary restrictions, but with a little careful attention to the menu and help from the friendly staff, everyone should be able to find at least something to eat there."}
{"text":"Meh. I have reviewed this restaurant more positively in the past and to be honest I don't know what has happened to them. They seem to be heading downhill in quality and uphill on price. There are flies around the main dining area even in the dead of winter and on looking around it becomes obvious that the place hasn't been given a deep cleaning in many years. Given the geriatric clientele that makes up the bulk of regular customers, it can be expected that the decor looks like a mishmash of 70s and 80s generic diner/hotel tchotchkis, but one at least expects a general dusting of fixtures from time to time rather than dustbunnies flying freely through the air.  As for the food, dinner is what they seem best at. The last time I was there was unfortunately breakfast and I had high hopes for the \"frittatta omelet\" which tunred out to be nothing more than a severely overcooked egg (browned rubber) with canned tomato sauce poured over it and the flavor was horrifying. For dinners there, I stick to the basics that you could expect to be reasonably fresh. If it sounds too exotic, it is probably from the back of a freezer or out of a can. The desserts are from off-site so they are the usual mixture of cakes and pies. I do enjoy their hot turkey sandwich still, but I have not ordered a salad since receiving a plate full of water with leaves of lettuce on it (and tomatoes/hard boiled eggs even though it was supposed to be a ceasar salad)."}
{"text":"Bf and I found this place while staying in Monroeville. We both got omelets and home fries and they were great! Prices where good and the staff was attentive and pleasant. Great diner feel. Will go back when in the area."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Fast friendly service, good omelette and didn't skimp on portion size. Fair prices for good diner style breakfast.  If you recommend this place I guarantee you get the big thumbs up from Papi.  I did not see any spinach puffs on the menu."}
{"text":"I eat breakfast at Drew's on average 3 times a week. The variety of the breakfast menu is great and you can order breakfast anytime. Their service is excellent with friendly, professional servers. This is my neighborhood go-to place."}
{"text":"Drew's has become our go-to breakfast place.  My husband & i used to try to go to the Square Cafe on weekend mornings, but upon seeing the hoards on the sidewalk waiting to get a table, we just kept going down the hill to the Parkway, go one exit to Ardmore Blvd. and have a terrific meal at Drew's.  We'd been turned off at the Square by high cost ($4 for a pancake? Really?!?!), cramped space, long waits but Drew's is comfortable, the waitresses are pros and food unpretentious.  I docked them 1 star because their coffee always tastes a bit stale, like they need a new Bunn."}
{"text":"Food is good nothing to go out of your way for.  Pricing is ridiculous though by far the most over priced place I've seen. The food is ok but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Drew's is a unique family-style restaurant. Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's the kind of restaurant that large franchises like Denny's or even smaller ones like Eat 'n Park aspire to, but fall short.  I've eaten there for years and have never, EVER been disappointed in the food OR service.  The best breakfast in my opinion is the corned beef hash with eggs any style. I'll order it for lunch or dinner as well. The corned beef is fresh and grilled with chopped homestyle potatoes...the little crispy bits of potatoes, corned beef and onions make the dish truly remarkable.  Pancakes are a delicious filling alternative and put the pancakes at other places to shame. For lunch, you can't go wrong with a simple cheeseburger, but if you like a Reuben, order one of Drew's. You won't be sorry. Their club sandwich, a sandwich that has become a mainstay at diners and restaurants like Drew's is also exceptional.  Dessert wise, I am a pie kind of guy and the pies are first rate at Drew's. And so much better than Eat 'N Park's selections, but you will be amazed at the specialty cakes offered as desserts here. Just wonderful and fresh.  As I write this review, Drew's has been offering one night a month designated as GREEK NIGHT. If you are a fan of Greek food, you MUST show up for Drew's GREEK NIGHT affair. But get there early, anyone on the know, knows that Greek Night is NOT to be missed at this fine restaurant."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide between Drew's or Roman's. Decided on Drew's made the right choose. Had the hot meatloaf very good and girlfriend had Spaghetti and meatballs loved it. Also had cream of mushroom soup great on such a cold night."}
{"text":"This is a very Family Friendly Restaurant. All the food is homemade & extremely good. There breakfast is out of sight. I enjoy this place. I recommend you try it you'll love it!!!"}
{"text":"Most folks who go to Drew's have been going to Drew's for years. The food is excellent, service superb. It's no wonder people keep coming back.  Breakfast is served all day and is excellent. Lunch sandwiches are really tasty but my favorite is the dinner specials. They change nightly but there are always a great selection to choose from. Delicious.  Make sure you say hi to the owners. They do a nice job of making their rounds. Price is very reasonable, as well."}
{"text":"Love drews!!!!! The turkey dinner is the best .... baked swiss steak great also.....n9bady makes ckicken fingers like they do.    Fresh home fries  the best"}
{"text":"Food is very good, very good value. But our waitress had a very big attitude towards us. She was mean and I felt done very very negative vibes coming from her. Sorry, but I won't be back caste she was just too mean."}
{"text":"I've been going to Drews restaurant for 20 years,it amazed me how good the services is and how clean the restaurant  is maybe a little biased."}
{"text":"We live close to Drew's and go once every couple of weeks. We love it. It's a really friendly family atmosphere. The wait staff is always very accommodating to any requests. The food is exactly what you would expect from a diner-style establishment-- excellent home-cooked fare. Breakfasts are always good-- my kids tend to stick with pancakes, French toast and waffles. I usually get an egg dish and I've never been disappointed. Their fish sandwich is delish and their salads are huge. My husband loves the tuna melt. The fries sometimes tend to be a little underdone for my tastes, but if you ask for them crispy, they'll cook them longer. The portions are enormous. The owners are almost always around, and if you have a problem, ask for them. We love Drew's and appreciate the personal service."}
{"text":"I had an amazing fish sandwich & fries, coffee was weak but good, and you never can go wrong with the desserts..."}
{"text":"Drew's has great food with some pretty diverse daily specials. The zucchini strips and hot roast beef sandwich are my favorites. I'm told the pies are great too."}
{"text":"I have the best French Toast I've tasted in a long time.  Nice family style restaurant with homemade cakes and pies behind a glass case.  I went for the first time with colleges and got the breakfast sampler.  It comes with eggs, sausage, bacon, and French toast. I also go a side of home fries... the kind that are sliced potatoes and sautéed onions! YUM!!  Our waiter was soooo friendly!! I can wait to go back.  Oh ya... they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner options all day!! Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Ill be honest, ive only had breakfast here. Each time I have hot something different amd enjoyed it all.  The breakfast is maybe a little over priced for an ordinary diner. But the portions were great and the food was just as good. The service has always been good. Also even though busy on weekends mornings, I have never experienced longer than a 2 minute wait to be seated"}
{"text":"I love diner food.  The menu is huge, the portions are huge, and the bill is small.  The coffee is tasty and you can have breakfast all day.  What's not to like?  My go-to for the first time at a new diner is a turkey club.  It's a sandwich I won't make at home because it's rare I have all the ingredients on-hand, but an easy sammie to execute at any level.  I like it with honey mustard over mayo, on white toast, with a pickle.  And Drew's knocked it out of the park for one reason: it's real, sliced turkey!!!  Not some processed, gelatinous deli meat, but actual sliced turkey!  I couldn't believe it and now I'm spoiled on club sandwiches for a long time.  And the honey mustard--house made!  Excellent!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the area, I've only found a few places to eat around Forest Hills that I really like. Drew's Family Restaurant being one of the few. YAY!  I'm only going to review the breakfast because I've never eaten here for lunch or dinner. Drew's has become a Saturday morning staple! The breakfast sampler is classic and happens to be one of my favorites! French toast is made perfectly!  Nothing fancy, so don't expect it because it's not that kind of place... just really GREAT food, clean place, and great service!!  Shout out to Cheryl! You're the best!"}
{"text":"Fast Great service. My party enjoyed all of are dishes. The steak salad was great. Real steak not steak umms. My son loved his cup of cream of zucchini."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I was a bit frightened when I walked in for the first time. I felt like it was 1950, and I was oddly dressed because of my... jeans. It looked like an old-fashioned diner, which, I'm assuming, is the look it's supposed to have.  Anyway, my first experience was decent. The waitress came around just enough times to serve me water and bring out my spaghetti that was a bit on the watery side. Side note: I don't understand how restaurants fail to properly drain noodles.  The second experience was awful. I'm pretty sure my waiter forgot about me as I was seated in what I like to call the \"uncool\" section. I was tempted to get up and serve myself water because it got to the point where I thought his shift ended. Like my first experience, I ordered pasta, which was decent.  I haven't been back there in a while, and I'm not too sure I'll return any time soon."}
{"text":"wow. i didn't go in expecting fine dining, but i did have high hopes for a decent breakfast... eggs are a delicate and heat sensitive item, so when we saw our order come up- then watched our waitress go fill up some water glasses, take 2 orders, deliver some ketchup, chat with a table, wipe down the counter, fetch a paper to look at, casually re-set the counter- turn see our order, then head back out to refill some coffee before finally picking up our sad sad cold order and dropping it off.... well i pretty much just wanted to leave, but i was also starving and had waited, so i gave it a shot. but as you have probably guessed it was pretty much inedible. both orders at our table had poached eggs, and on both orders the eggs were punctured so that the yolk was everywhere, and cold. not even going to talk about the potatoes, i'm sure they were last night's baked potatoes- just slightly re-heated, not even a slight golden brown to them.  and to add insult to injury, it was $20. don't bother- there is a reason it is empty, let it stay that way."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years. Live in the area. Clean and food is fresh. Friendly staff. Food is good. You get really bored with the menu and have to take a break from the place ow and then. Prices too high for diner food. Now....the pizza. Really?! Got it once. Canned sauce. Worst pizza we ever ate. Shame on Drews for trying to copy Vincent's pizza. Bad karma...not many cars in your lot at dinner anymore. I think you should modernize menu and forget that pizza."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a bunch of times now and the pricing and portions are always very good. Tonight's meal was no different. The desserts are always tasty and plentiful for more than one. We have yet to come across a dish that wasn't yummy.  The problem tonight was the booth we sat in smelled like poop in the back part. My 15 yr old daughter got a wiff of it as did I. We decided to move to another table and I explained it to another waitress as everyone kind of looked at us like umm are you nuts. She told the manager and his reply to her was this, \"it's not poop it's Romano cheese\"."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant by doing a YELP search, and we were NOT disappointed. It does not look like a diner from the outside, but a diner indoors. The staff is incredibly friendly!!!!! The food was GOOD and the service was FAST! We highly recommend Drew's. If we lived closer, we would frequent it often!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for the first time today for breakfast. We're not from the area and were looking for a good home-style breakfast. Drew's was easy to find and we had no problems with parking. It almost reminded us of a King's. There was no wait for a Saturday morning (8:30am) and there was plenty of seating. Our waitress was attentive and polite. My husband ordered the Breakfast Sampler (french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage). According to him, the french toast was \"excellent\" and eggs were \"cooked exactly right\" (over-medium). I had the Belgian Waffle and added eggs (2). Everything was really good and the best part was the warm syrup. Even the iced tea was better than most diners I've been to. It's a shame this place isn't too close for us or we would definitely go more often!"}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped and had breakfast. French toast was delicious and ham was legit. Warm and fresh. Coffee was even good for small time diner. Service was excellent. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Drew's quite a while but introduce my husband for the first time if you weeks back. We stopped in for brunch and I ordered an omelette with home fries and a coffee. He ordered eggs Benedict with coffee and a side of hashbrowns.   We had a short wait but were seated in a side room at a table for two. My husband felt it was the best diner he has been to. The portions were extremely well for the price and the wait staff was extreme friendly and attentive. The food took about five minutes to arrive and it was hot to the taste. My cheese and onion omelette was humongous and I didn't even have room to start digging into the home fries before I was full. We also got an app of breaded mushrooms, which came with this AMAZING horseradish sauce. Our total bill came to less than $30.   The second time we went here I ordered a small salad (which was enough for 2 people) and my husband got an omelette (with home fries and toast). Both were absolutely delicious and the ingredients in the salad tastes really fresh. This is easily the best diner in Pittsburgh. BYOB for dinner with no corkage fee. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Drew's is the go-to brunch place for when visitors come to town.   The decor is simple and clean, not modern or kitschy. Usually the display case is full of delicious desserts you can have at the table or to-go, but I suspect that 2pm is too late if you wanted to see the full selection. It can get very crowded right after church on Sundays, so avoid 10am-2pm if you don't want to wait a little while.  The server I had most recently was friendly and observant. She gave us time to browse the menu, answered questions, and offered a refill on my coffee (rare these days).   My friend ordered buffalo wings off of the appetizer menu and a side of fries. I was worried it wasn't going to be enough, but the plate of oversized wing dings was plenty (she took half of it home). I ordered the breakfast sampler with french toast, all bacon, and eggs over easy. My eggs were perfect: solid whites, with warm runny yolk. The bacon was more crisp that it looked, which is great because I almost sent it back for more cook time. Finally- the french toast was terrible. I was astounded by how bad it was. It tasted just like buttered white toast- no cinnamon, no egg, no other flavor besides toast and butter. I tried to drown it with syrup, but it didn't improve the taste at all. Had the toast been a side and not my main, I might have excused this oddity.  This was my first time leaving a restaurant still hungry and with the taste of buttered toast on my tongue.  Drew's is a hometown favorite and I know I'll go back... but I'll take my time."}
{"text":"Greek Night!  Total success.  Delicious entrees, large selections, and full of authentic flavors.......and aromas.  Ribs were especially tasty.  Must get to the next one in Nov.  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place was put on my radar once my friend told me about how good of diner food they have, and I am a sucker for some good diner food.  Having time to kill between running errands and work I decided that I needed to get some stomach-filling food.  The type of food that makes you feel full for the remainder of the day.  Pulling in here you notice that this place does not have the typical diner look.  In fact it looks like any old restaurant you may come across along the road.  The lot itself has ample parking which was a pleasant surprise.    Once I entered I decided to take a seat at the counter top inside of taking up a whole booth to myself.  Best decision to make here.  You get to see everything that happens inside this space.  You get to see that hostess greet the staff, the serving staff buzzing around, and the cooks in the back working as if there were no obstacles to their job.  Without asking water showed up in front of me, which I liked.  No need to wait for a drink.  After skimming over the descriptions of the meals available I needed not go any further once I saw meatloaf.  I can't tell you why, but when I think of diner food, I always end up thinking about meatloaf.  So that is what I got here, their version of meatloaf which they called Hot Baked Meatloaf.  Basically a hot meatloaf sandwich smothered with gravy and your choice of potato.  Of course I went with mashed as it seems to be an appropriate pairing for a meatloaf dinner, also smothered in gravy.  The meatloaf itself was so tender, it was fall apart tender.  Each bite I took I mixed it all together; bread, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  So good that I didn't put my knife and fork down until I was done and almost to the point of scraping the plate to every last bit was gone.  The staff were so pleasant and not overbearing at all.  You could tell that they enjoyed their job and their patrons.  You could also tell who the regulars are as they walked through the doors.  Every one that was a regular was greeted by name and basically asked the same question, \"The usual?\"  I think I need to start coming here regularly, so that I can get what I want on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"I think part of the reason I like doing the occasional home visits for my job is that I get the chance to eat lunch at local places like Drew's.  Such was the case when I stopped in here last week.  I was mighty tempted by the hot roast turkey and potatoes, but for my money, nothin' says lunch in a diner like a good club sandwich.  I had the turkey club--basically a BLT with sliced turkey.  With a side of coleslaw and some coffee, it was just right.  As stated before, Drew;'s has been a Forest Hills icon for many years.  In fact, it's been around for over a century.  In my book, Drew's rates a solid 3 to 3.5 stars.  Ps.  I think my husband Rick and I will be back for Greek Night on November 8, 2014."}
{"text":"I've been to Drew's in the past, mainly for breakfast. I haven't been there for a couple of years, but my husband and I decided to stop for a quick dinner since we live in the area.   We went in an hour to closing and were met with a not-so-friendly hostess who made it seem like we were a bother. She took us to our table, put the menus down, and just walked away. It took a couple of minutes for our waitress to greet us, but she was very nice.   We finally ordered and got a fried chicken sandwich and burger. Our meals did not take long to come out at all. However, they weren't the best. The chicken sandwich looked extremely delicious and the breading was, but the chicken inside was extremely dry. My husband got the burger and like the char-grilled taste of the burger, but it was dry too. The fries were mediocre.   Our waitress was very attentive throughout the whole meal and refilled our drinks anytime they were empty.   We thought everything was pretty expensive. Sandwiches don't come with a side, so by the time you add a fries or even another side, a plate is over $10. Two of us ate for $28. This wouldn't be terrible for a nicer restaurant, but for a diner we think it is extremely overpriced.  All in all, it wasn't the worst experience, but we will definitely not be returning to Drew's in the near future and definitely not for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Drew's is still kicking!!! I love this place!! I used to go here with my family all the time as it was my grandma's fave place to dine out!! I haven't lived in Pittsburgh in 10+ years, but would totally love to go here next time I visit!! This place to me is classic Pittsburgh and I absolutely love the food!"}
{"text":"Great little diner in Forest Hills with tasty offerings. The only drawback is the inflated prices."}
{"text":"Excellent service!! I love this place! It has been one of my favorite restaurants for many years! I never leave disappointed. Orders come out pretty quick but made to perfection! The servers  are very  attentive & knowledgeable about the menu. No matter if you go for breakfast, lunch ,dinner, or even to grab desert the food is way above average! Fresh food just like A good home home-cooked meal!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend took me to this place since we just moved right by here! I figured it was the run of the mill typical dinner spot but I was surprisingly impressed. The decor and place is not fancy at all but the food speaks for it self. I got the veal Parmesan and it was huge. Everything I say coming out of the kitchen was proportioned big and looked delicious. My dinner was cooked perfectly and I had a ton of left overs. My boyfriend got the hot turkey sandwich smothered in gravy with fries and he barely polished it off. I can not wait to try this place again! My only complaint is it was cold inside at our table and the waitress was a little slow to attend to us but she was super friendly and thanked us for waiting."}
{"text":"I love Drew's. It's not a perfect restaurant, but it is consistent and the service is always attentive and good. They can manage 2-8 people easily.  We always eat there at least once when we are visiting Pittsburgh.   Typical of a large menu, not every dish is hittin' it. The sandwiches and pancakes are probably their weakest offerings, deserving a four star rating.  The omelets are flavorful but a warning: they tend to be a bit dry. The dinner plates are all very good, and the corned beef hash is wonderful!  All the fish plates have been worth it as are the breakfast platters.   The restaurant is generally very clean."}
{"text":"This is American diner food, i.e. unhealthy. I haven't found anything remarkable during my visits here. I prefer to avoid the place. Do \"huge portions\" of mediocre food warrant 4 or 5 stars? I don't think so."}
{"text":"This is comparable to Eat n' Park, but since Eat n' Park is everywhere this is a nice change.  I've only been here for breakfast and everytime I've gone the food tasted great and the service was prompt and courteous.    We tend to go here the day after drinking so we tend to be famished and could eat anything, but honestly, the french toast is delish!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Just had the best breaded cod sandwich on Mancini's bread. It was a large portion and positively yummy."}
{"text":"Drew's has been around for over 100 years and has been a staple in the area. I remember my parents bringing me here when I was little....and I remembered their breakfasts were delicious! My parents still come out here all of the time and love it. My husband, parents, and I stopped here for dinner last night and I just don't remember it being as great as when I was younger.  First of all, it was dinnertime and, naturally, pretty busy. The restaurant is broken up into five sections of tables and some booths, plus a counter. My mom and I asked the hostess for a booth. He said there weren't any available. I pointed out that there was, in fact, two booths, but they needed bused. We'd wait, no biggie. He wasn't very happy about this, but an older woman spoke up and said that she would take care of clearing the table, which we were thankful for since the only other places open were two tables smack dab in the middle of one of the rooms (no thanks, hello anxiety!) or the counter (not conducive for a group of 4).  My parents and husband were happy with their meals - liver and onions and sides, pot roast and sides, and hot turkey and fries. I thought that the dinner prices were outrageous for a diner, so I went with a grilled chicken sandwich...$6.50. Great, but it only comes with potato chips. I ended up getting two sides for an additional $3.95 which then makes my chicken Sammy a little pricey. I got a salad and fries as my sides. Everything was good, but a little expensive. My husband got dessert (shocker!)...it was called Chocolate Explosion or Chocolate Eruption, something like that. I was surprised to find out that they didn't make their desserts, and that they were from Keystone Bakery. Still, I had a bit (or two) and it was yummy.  The other 'negatives' were 1) our waiter, although friendly, was slow. And you had to ask for everything: refills, napkins, the bill....huge pet peeve of mine. 2) it was absolutely freezing cold. I mean, I realize that restaurants generally keep the AC at a lower temp, but it felt like 60 degrees in there. So, I'd go back to try their breakfast since it's been so long or even maybe give lunch or dinner one more try, but Drew's just wasn't as great as I remembered."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here.  Usually go for breakfast but recently had lunch. Good Rueban sandwich, great service."}
{"text":"a cozy breakfast spot similar to dennys or kings minus the shit your pants feeling you get from dennys or kings.  ive only eaten breakfast here cant speak on the other foods but if you can make a bomb breakfast lunch and dinner should be similar."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast, but seemed overpriced for what we got and pretty far out of the way. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Drew's is what you want in your little neighborhood diner. It's casual. Families are welcome. The staff smile a lot and are generally friendly folks. It's relaxed. The menu features lots of comfort food. It's a classic local diner.  Breakfast at Drew's is a very popular draw for those who live in Forest Hills and other nearby neighborhoods such as Regent Square and Braddock Hills. It's not as cheap as you might expect a diner breakfast to be, but the food is certainly good. I love their Belgian waffles, in particular. They are perfectly golden, crisp on the outside, tender inside, and topped with real maple syrup. The eggs benedict are also delectable and at Drew's, they really do poach the eggs. (What good is eggs benedict without runny yolks - salmonella be damned?)   Lunch brings an array of soups, salads, burgers and sandwiches that are basic but tasty. If you want sides, for $3.50 you can upgrade to a platter and get fries, coleslaw, and a cup of soup along with your main event.   As for dinner, the choices are very much \"mom's home cooking\" kinds of choices: meatloaf, liver and onions (hard to find these days), baked scrod, veal parmigiana.   Again, prices are a bit more than you might expect for a diner, but not terrible. (For dinner, you'll pay anywhere from $10 - $20 for your entree, depending on what you select.) And in all honesty, I would rather spend an extra $3 to eat at a local, independently-owned restaurant than give my hard-earned money over to a mega-corporation that is killing businesses like Drew's.   The bottom line: Drew's is a decent, friendly neighborhood diner with excellent food and a relaxed atmosphere. It's not the cheapest place, but it's reasonable and worth a few extra bucks."}
{"text":"Excellent meal here!  Family atmosphere, accommodating  waitstaff.  Homemade coleslaw.  My sister had a portobello mushroom feta cheese salad and enjoyed.  We both had chicken schnitzel.  Huge portion of lightly coated, garlic butter flavored chicken breast.  If you have room for dessert, go for it!  We each had a cappuccino instead.  Don't  miss this terrific local restaurant."}
{"text":"this place has become my breakfast place when I'm hungry on weekend mornings.  I really like this place is still its own diner. Unfortunately in this area east of Pittsburgh a lot of the independent diners of going away in all we're left with are chain restaurants.  I have always found the staff to be very engaging here and they do a great job taking care of you.  I can't tell you how many times I've been at this place early on a Saturday or Sunday morning and there are people sitting at the counter actually talking to each other. I've had most of the breakfast dishes and most of them are very good.  my wife always goes for a BLT or a toasted cheese sandwich and she likes it enough that she comes back with me when I go here.  I have to say that for breakfast if you get one of the sides they can be rather large sometimes. Not a bad thing."}
{"text":"Staff always seems to have a smile on their face. Good is good dinner food (Nothing out of this world, but satisfies you grease craving.)  Always our quick fix if we just don't want to cook dinner. Since we are so close to the area."}
{"text":"Better than average diner food for almost fine dining prices.  Two adults and one child dining and the total was almost $50.  We had pork schnitzel and a steak salad.  The pork was good, if a little dry.  The salad that accompanies it was generous and topped with two whole slices of bacon. The steak salad was a bit of a disappointment,  it was definitely a large portion but almost half of the bulk was made of giant chunks of kale. No one wants that much raw kale.  The kids chicken fingers looked homemade and were definitely made from real, not processed chicken.   The desserts were impressive to look at but for $6.50 for a slice of cake it better be at least pretty good.   I'd try this place again, but wont order the same things."}
{"text":"Drew's is a great diner-style restaurant with quality food and a wonderful staff. It's not the healthiest food, but you probably aren't looking for health food if you come to Drew's. It's moderately priced for a diner, but it's well worth it for the service and quality.   One of my favorite things here is their PIZZA. My friends and I got it thinking that eight slices wouldn't be enough for us, but we were surprised that the pizza was both massive and filling. It's easily some of the best pizza I've ever had, but it does weigh on you a little heavily.   The fried mushrooms and zucchini are also delicious appetizers. I love mushrooms, and getting them fried is a treat for me.   Their breakfast is also pretty delicious. These pancakes put Denny's and iHop to shame, and the little bowl of whipped cream certainly makes it even better for a sugar addict like myself.   My favorite part of this diner though is probably their cakes. They are unbelievably decadent, fairly priced for the portion you get and so so so so good.   Dining at Drew's makes me feel like I'm part of an undiscovered secret nestled in Forest Hills. The good food and incredible service makes me smile every time I come here, and I always look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Drew's is a really nice family restaurant. I'm surprised at the negative reviews. I've been here several times and the food and service has been consistently great. It costs about the same as Eat N Park but is considerably more upscale (especially compared to the horrible Eat N Park in nearby Edgewood). Compared to most similar places, I'd go here any day.   Try the fried zucchini with horseradish sauce."}
{"text":"This is far and away the tastiest diner breakfast that I've ever had in Pittsburgh. Delicious pancakes, eggs, and French toast on my plate and my family also had the veggie and Ionian omelette and loved it all. Great coffee, wasn't over crowded and the staff were friendly and efficient. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pam is my favorite server. The food is always yum and the service always exceptional!"}
{"text":"This is a nice, family-friendly diner that looks like it has a lot of returning customers. We came here for brunch on Labor Day and were seated in a cute and mini booth (perfect for me!). I was thinking about the Italian frittata, but ordered a waffle and sausage links instead (nothing special, but satisfied my breakfast food craving). Boyfriend ordered steak and eggs, which he enjoyed (even though the steak wasn't made the way he wanted). We also ordered a side of home fries that were kind of bland; wish they added some seasoning and made them crispier. Luckily some salt & pepper on the table helped. Prices were pretty standard for a diner. The people at the table next to us had bagel and lox that looked good, so we might try that if we come back.

{"text":"Fantastic diner. Got the Breakfast Sampler, two eggs, two strips of bacon, two sausages, two pancakes for $7.75. As a New Yorker, this is awesome. A person at my table got the Greek salad, and I was envious. Peppers, beets, anchovies, whole blocks of feta cheese... this was one of the most complete Greek salads I've ever seen.  The walls have cute Burton Morris paintings that give the diner an art deco feel."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast foods. They tend to be a little over priced so I don't go there as often as I would like to but when I do go I never have a bad meal. The children's meals are very large as well."}
{"text":"Greeted quickly as we walked in, seated right by the window. Menu was extensive and had options for everyone. I decided to go with breakfast and I'm glad I did.  Good was tasty and fresh! Like it was cooked in my moms kitchen. I was so full I had to skip the awesome desert selection"}
{"text":"Drew's is too big to be called a diner, and kind of has a chain restaurant feel to it, but it was still pretty good. Their omelets are \"made to order,\" although I'm not sure how that compares to other restaurants. And they have English muffin toast, which I've never even heard of before. (Basically the inside of a muffin in square bread form.)  I ordered an omelet author broccoli, ham and feta. The chunks of broccoli and ham were huge, but it definitely could have used more cheese. Both my wife and I ordered sides of fruit which were pretty big compared to other breakfast spots.   The service was good and the food wasn't bad, so we will probably be back."}
{"text":"Have only eaten here for breakfast, but it has aways been really good.   The Farmer's omlet is the way to go.   Service can sometimes be a little slow but the staff is friendly so it's not anything bothersome."}
{"text":"I lived in the area my whole life and never stopped in until this visit. Came for my birthday breakfast everything was pretty good but I expected more from what I was told. My pancakes had a weird taste as if something was cooked on the grill before them and didn't turn out well. Service was good. Love the diner like feel."}
{"text":"Old time diner feel! Great food! Huge portions! Very nicely priced! Fast service!  Jean was our server and she was wonderful! My daughter got the silver dollar pancakes and bacon with cranberry juice to drink and I got the Italian omelette with home fries and onions and Italian toast with coffee. $19 for everything!  There was so much food that I'm fairly certain I could eat the leftovers for lunch and dinner!!  We will be back again for breakfast.  Best way to start our day."}
{"text":"If you never been here , give this place a try. I've been going here since I was a kid and I love it. Everyone I drag to this place loves it too."}
{"text":"Good prices and a great selection of meal choices! I always have a difficult time choosing what to order. I made the mistake of ordering the biggest hamburger they had out of curiosity. I was the biggest burger I have seen so far. I almost had to cut it into fourths so I can actually manage to hold it. I barely was able to force myself to finish it. Certainly worth returning to!"}
{"text":"My family is originally from North Braddock, and we continued to visit my grandparents there until they passed. En route to Gram and Pap's house, my family always passed Drew's Restaurant.  I always wondered what it was like inside.  Now that I spend a great deal of time in Forest Hills, I have had the opportunity to stop in a few times.  Drew's is your typical family diner, with tasty breakfasts, daily specials, and mediocre dinners.   The cook is a bit ornery, but he's adept at what he does.  The silver-haired waitresses remind me of my 6th grade math teacher.  Oh sure, she has a heart of gold and certainly wants you to succeed, but that doesn't change the fact that 1. she doesn't want to be there and 2. will send your butt to detention if you pass a note in class and no, you can't use the restroom right now.  We're taking a pop quiz on proofs and that takes precedence over your bladder.   Where was I?  The breakfasts are hearty and well-prepared. I enjoy both the Ionian (Greek) and Italian omelettes.  They are served with two pieces of toast and have have easily been split between myself and my boyfriend for a well-portioned start to our day.   I'd steer clear from their dinners. I don't understand why liver and onions is always a special at these diner-type places.  Do post-Cold War Americans ever eat liver and onions?  I'm genuinely curious.   Overall, not a bad place. Stop in for an omelette and a scolding from the waitresses if you're ever on Ardmore Blvd."}
{"text":"I come to Drew's most Friday mornings with a group of friends.  This is our local diner.  I personally like trying all kinds of different breakfast items and have ordered almost every item off of their breakfast menu.  I would say that they have a nice selection of items for breakfast and there are few that I would say I did not enjoy.  Their corned beef hash is very tasty.  I often times will order it with smoked salmon instead of corned beef, and enjoy the smokey flavor of that dish.     Overall, it's fun to consider myself a local at the neighborhood diner.  I wouldn't say you should come to Drew's and expect a gourmet breakfast, with the freshest ingredients; but if you are looking for a place with good omelets, pancakes, and eggs then this is the place!"}
{"text":"I feel like I need to wait and have more of an experience before reviewing Drew's but here we go.   Drew's confuses me a little. I went there and ordered their Sampler Breakfast meal and felt it was a little small for an $8 meal, but on the other hand someone else at the table ordered a salad and it practically came in a mixing bowl.   Everyone at the table was trying to figure out what to do with all the extra lettuce because you couldn't really eat it with how full it was. I can't really complain about my meal, I mean it was good I just left a little hungry that's all. I think I could have eat two of the samplers and been full.  It's one of the few restaurants in Forest Hills so I want it to stick around for a while. I will have to go in and have some more of Drew's offerings to give you a more well rounded idea of the place."}
{"text":"Good diner food. My wife had the cornbeef hash and it's the best she's ever had. My daughter had a waffle and it's what you expect. It did come with house made whip cream which she really liked. I got the chicken club which was good. Go for the hash!"}
{"text":"Stopped going here because of the bad health reports nut living I'm the edge I have it a try. I was very impressed and the food was amazing. I believe they must of gotten mew cooks."}
