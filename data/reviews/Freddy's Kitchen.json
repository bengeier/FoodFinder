{"text":"Delish! I went to this place once because I was craving Carribean food..and I don't know about too many in the Mississauga area..
I ordered the Jerk Pork and it was tasty, juicy and fresh.
Portions are great..and the price is right..my combo was around 10-12 dollars ( I got a pop with it too). 
It's authentic tasting, and spicy.
there is only take-out, and I guess I took a star off because I felt I waited a bit long for take-out, but this isn't a fast food joint, so keep that in mind. It was nothing unbearable.

I recommend that you check this place out!"}
{"text":"Awesome Jerk chicken, great serving sizes, and friendly service.  The wings are awesome too"}
{"text":"Great Jerk Chicken. Awesome portions. They cook limited food so don't be surprised when you are in at 7 and the daily special is run out. Jerk chicken is just right fall off the bone. Right amount of spice till the bone and not too dry."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out because of all the good Yelp reviews. 

When I walked into this place, I immediately felt unwelcome getting the stare down from the 2 people behind the counter (not sure about the reviews boasting the great customer service, but from my experience, it was a far cry from that!) anyway...the dishes ranged from about $7-$13 and I decided to get the Curry Goat ($8). The portion was plentiful and the goat was more tender than I expected. I didn't really like the spice of the dish, it had a bit of a sweetness to it that O can't describe. I probably wouldn't go back to this place as it was just \"okay.\"  Nothing to write home about here."}
{"text":"Visited Freddy's on the weekend.  I had the escoveitched fish which is a traditional Jamaican dish of fried red snapper marinated in vinegar, allspice and onions.  The fish was huge...more than enough for two servings.  As a side I chose extra veggies over rice & peas.  Veggies were broccoli and peppers sauteed in toasted garlic and butter."}
{"text":"The food is good. Not amazing. But good. However, the service leaves much room for improvement."}
{"text":"This place is essentially a hole in the wall. This place is also as good as it gets when it comes to jerk chicken. 

I've been there twice now, once for the jerk chicken and once for the oxtail. Both times, the food was amazing. The dishes come with rice and peas, vegetables, and a generous amount of meat. The prices range from $8-12 for small and large sizes (order a small, it'll be more than enough). 

They also offer many other dishes, including goat, chicken wings, and various types of seafood. Each day, they will also rotate an endless list of specials to keep the menu fresh. Check the open fridge and you'll also see a variety of Carribean drinks. 

There's no seating at Freddy's Kitchen, so only go for takeout. 

Parking is located in the back and can be accessed from either Hurontario or King St."}
{"text":"I am on a mission to find yummy Caribbean eats and have been scouting Freddy's for while now. I have tried the Jerk Chicken, Gungapea and Chicken Foot Soup, Festivals, Rice and Pea, Curry Goat, Veggie Side and Jerk Pork. 
I found the Jerk Chicken to be good. Lots of Fall off the bone tender chicken. Very mild spice levels. 
The one eye popper was the Gungapea and Chicken Foot Soup. I  have only had it once but Dayaam was it yummy.   Good count on the Chicken Foot. 
You have the option of White Rice or R & P with every special or entree.  I have opted for the R & P every time I have visited.  It needs more love. 
I recently discovered that they only serve Jerk Pork Thursday thru Sunday.  I had the Jerk Pork with Festival as a side. Pork was tender, moist and tasty. Sadly, my pork special was 40 percent fat chunks.  
Festival is a deep fried fritter. Similar taste to an old fashion donut. It went really well with the Pork.  
I personally love the \"wild\" flavour of Goat. I found the Curry Goat to be tender and fall off the bone. Lots of yummy marrow to be sucked out of the bones but I think once was good enough for me. 
The Veggie side is pure health. Good crunch to the Broc and Carrots. Way to go on the veg Freddy. 
Sadly, the only thing Freddy offers for extra heat is a complimentary store bought Pepper Sauce.
Plenty of parking but be advised that entrance to the restaurant is off of King St. 
Takeout only. 
Debit Card Friendly!!
Peace out!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Quick service and fair prices for how much you get. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places to get Caribbean cuisine around 5 and 10 . Great customer service, great food, good portions but can be a little pricey. Jerk chicken is great! Not too spicy and good amount of chicken. The oxtail was great! Not too fatty and had good flavour. They serve rice and pigeon peas which is a nice change from the  usual rice and red beans. 

No seats, just a take out joint. Call ahead they are a bit slow sometimes."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp, let's just say that I was so amazed by the customer service and the food. I had the steak with peas and rice - I now want to go back again. I would recommend this to anyone, all of my friends love this place"}
{"text":"I actually called ahead to place an order for pickup as one of the other yelpers suggested.
The person(female) who answered the phone kept responding YES, SURE, YES. Which I thought was a bit weird, maybe they were just busy.
The only thing is when I got there, only one customer was in the store sitting down eating her soup of the day, which she was raving about (Manish Water). Apparently they have a different soup daily. and my food was not prepared and I came 15mins or so after I called which is plenty of time to scoop food into a container -_-
Customer Service is there but don't expect conversations or anything more than your total .. I mean your paying less than 20 bucks for take out, this isn't some dine in restaurant where you are waited on. 
The restaurant is located off of King street, when you turn onto king street from Hurontario you will actually drive past the doors w 3 lil steps up.. you can barely see the sign but it is right beside a Hakka Chinese food place also with the name Freddy.turn into the first lot and walk back onto King st for the front door.
So I ordered a small oxtail (16$) and a lunch special fried chicken (8$), when I got there like I said my food wasn't prepared and I saw the price list 2$ more for a large oxtail so I told her just give me the large (not much difference only bigger container). I did find it a bit pricey I mean 18$, i don't know. 
The fried chicken was def worth the 8$, the chicken has a slight redish coating which I've never seen before not sure what they use that gives it that colour but tasted amazing and fresh. The oxtail on the other hand was quite rubbery and lots of fat. however the flavor was amazing , glad I got lots of gravy on my rice. Love that they do it with the butter beans (white lima beans), adds extra flavor. As i said it did all taste great but for the price/portion size/ fat-meat ratio I wouldn't spend 18$ . Maybe be back for the friend chicken and to try a soup special.

Rant end."}
