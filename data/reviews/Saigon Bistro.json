{"text":"The Broth!

By far the best in Tonroto and second only to my pho experience in Vietnam.  Forget about those faux pho (pun intended) in Vietnamese joints on Spadina.

I live in New Jersey.  I worked for a company in the area, so I was making a trip every other week for  about five months early this year.  This was my regular stop and I'd eat their pho almost every other day.

The owner knew my preferences; two thai-chilis, extra basil and a wad of extra napkins to wipe away my sweat.

After a bowl, I was good to go and face the cold Canadian winter air.

I miss it.  Tremendously.  Just the other day I walked into a Zagat rated Vietnamese joint in NYC and walked out gagging."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I have never had a bad meal here! My family and I have eaten here many times and we all love it! Even my father who is a meat and potatoes kind of guy liked it and so does my mother! I would recommend it to everyone except people allergic to MSG. I think they use it like most Asian restaurants do. The staff is super friendly also!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff are very welcoming and friendly. Food is always fast, delicious and well priced."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Takeout took 45 min and delivered with attitude. Beef vermicelli tastes like old socks. Will never return!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Price is reasonable. Better than the other Vietnamese restaurant in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Was good and cheap but raised prices with only noticeable difference being fancy new menus and outrageous prices. Service is slow and forgetful. Food was good before price increase but now not worth it, I'm not even full from the Pho there anymore. They think just because they are in Liberty Village they can hike the prices without doing anything but they are losing customers and respect."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary! Amazing spring rolls,  delicious soup,  and the way they cook their shrimp is unreal! We always order for pick up and it never takes more than 15 Mins, and the man is always so friendly and quick! I recommend this place to everyone and will always be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"Very nice service and greeted me right away when I entered. Great food and fast service."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre.  Vietnamese sub hardly had any meat and not very spicy."}
{"text":"I was driving to Philadelphia from Atlanta and decided to give this place a try based on nothing but an ad in a Vietnamese paper.  We pulled into the parking lot, and noticed the outdoor dining area.  I figured this place must be pretty cool since that's a rarity with Vietnamese places, at least as far as I know.  

When we stepped inside and realized we were the only people (on a Sunday), I immediately thought, This place is going to suck.  Not to mention the bare look of the interior.  

I was proven wrong however.  We ordered the appetizer sampler with the stuffed chicken wing (what?!), vegetarian crepe, and grilled tofu.  The tofu was fabulous, as was the stuffed chicken wing.  The crepe was a bit too oily, but it comes in two crepes per order....and logically, two of a not so good thing would be not so good, right?  Nah, the value overrode the oiliness in this case.  The rest of the appetizer platter was good but nothing memorable.  

I'll most likely never be back here, but that's more of a geographical thing.  I'd recommend it for a cheap satisfying meal."}
{"text":"ot sure why this would get 4 stars. I went here with a friend for lunch. The lady took my order and I told her I only wanted shrimp and no other meat. She brought my friend a soft drink that he never ordered. She brought him his food and never brought mine and left me there for almost 30 minutes and disappeared. I had to ask her where my food was and she looked confused. She then went and got me a plate filled with beef which I never even ordered. I told her that is not that I ordered this is about 1 hour into lunch. She says she will get them to make me my dish with shrimp. I told her to forget about it as my lunch break was up. She asked if I wanted it to go I said no thanks as I felt she would probably screw up my order again. Other patrons looked pissed off with her and she seemed to get their orders wrong. Not sure if it was just a bad server or if its always like this."}
{"text":"I'm still stuffed with the pad thai as I write this.

I was actually on my way over to the Fat Bastard Burrito next door when this place caught my eye. I decided I'd give it a try. 

To begin with, there wasn't many people inside as everyone seemed to be on the patio outside. yet curiously the waiter brought me inside. I didn't particularly mind nor did I doubt that the waiter would have moved me outside if I asked. 

I looked through their menus and found your typical Vietnamese selection. I opted for the chicken pad thai and requested that they make the meal spicier. They certainly complied and  I was feeling a pleasurable singe by the end of the meal.

All around, it was a fantastic meal. Service was very quick, my water was appropriately refilled when needed, and the pricing was absolutely fair.

It's the kind of experience that I'm sure I'll crave again in the future."}
{"text":"Went there toward the end of the night, it had definitely trailed off. The staff  was friendly but not very attentive. It did take a lil bit to get the order out, even though it was near empty. 

The food was tasty but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"This place has very good thing going for it.  It has traditionally cooked food and a great atmosphere.  It's definitely one to check out.  It's a very unassuming place, I drove by it many times and never even noticed it was there.  But it's worth the search."}
{"text":"NOTE: My Review of 4/5 is based only on Pho.

So I've been here now three times and have to say I am impressed with the broth, quantity of rice noodle and meat in my pho. The chili hot sauce has a bit more heat and kick than the other location of Asia 21 a couple blocks away. For that I enjoy it quite a bit with my pho.

I normally order the 21 (Rare Beef and Chicken Pho) and with tax, tip, you are looking at $11 in.

Been liking the pho more and more here and love the portion size.

EDIT: Prices went up a lot!"}
{"text":"Food is \"okay\" but the service is horrible. If you're with a party of more then two, forget about it. Something will be wrong. The food will be late, and you'll probably get something you didn't order. Drinks will come at the end, if at all. If you ask your server, you'll probably get a confused look."}
{"text":"The worst! Can't get your order right and they don't even acknowledge that they made a mistake."}
{"text":"Staff was attentive and very friendly. Spring rolls were delicious! Prices are low! Quality is high! Always a bonus when found together. We both had Sate Beef Pho and the broth was one of the best ive had and I eat ALOT of Pho. The only thing we didnt care for was the flat shaped noodles. It was our first encounter with a different shaped noodle in Pho and it threw us off a bit. With that said, the quality and flavour of the broth was by far, enough to outweigh the noodles. I will be back."}
{"text":"I was in Calgary for the Global Petroleum Show, staying at the Delta South. This little family run place was across the street and had great reviews so I gave it a try. It was very tasty, with a. Pretty big menu to choose from. I went with the chicken and shrimp vermicelli bowl and a come and it came to under $15. Generous portion, super tasty and friendly owner. I might go back there again tonight! I would check it it if you are in the area..."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Torontonian/Vietnamese restaurant. Prices are on the higher side (rice paper rolls were about $5). Service was quick, friendly and accommodating. The food itself was good and portions are on the generous side...however, the pho ga that I ordered could have had more chicken in it. Overall, not too shabby of a place to satisfy cravings for Vietnamese food - definitely worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Food: 3 Stars
Service: 3 Stars
Ambience: 4 Stars

Continuing on my recent attempt at trying random restaurants, we have Saigon Bistro located in Liberty Village. The restaurant was completely empty when I walked in though it was a little early for dinner and a few other patrons did come in shortly after. 

For the most part the menu contained fairly standard options for Vietnamese cuisine. There were also some other choices such as Pad Thai as well so definitely a lot of options to choose from. I ended up ordering the vermicelli with chicken and spring roll. The portions were decent size as I felt satisfied afterwards. Taste wise the food was not bad. The chicken and spring rolls were done fairly well and the fish sauce (which I love) tasted pretty good. My friend had the Pad Thai and he enjoyed it as well.

In terms of service the lady brought over menus, food and bill. That's it. Nothing spectacular but also nothing bad to say about it either. The place seemed bright and clean and there were plenty of seats in the restaurant.

All in all I have nothing bad to say about Saigon Bistro. The food did not blow me away but overall I enjoyed it and would not hesitate to come back again."}
{"text":"The food is decent and comparable to other Pho restaurant. However, sadly, the restaurant has atrocious service at multiple occasions.

It is by far the rudest restaurant I've ever come to see in my decade living in Toronto. I do not understand how a restaurant can be run like a gestapo prison camp.

The restaurant is relatively small - possibly seats 25 or less which is comparable to other restaurants in the neighborhood. However, the standout feature of this restaurant is that you can possibly get asked to pay the bill (and leave the premise) if you sit for more than 40-45 minutes during lunch (while still enjoying your food). The lady asked \"please come up to the front\" when we were still holding forks and knives. The restaurant also has a very strict policy with seating. If you are just dining with two people - you are not allowed, at any cost, to sit in the couch area. I've seen guests begging for them to sit where they were and the owner insist that it is not the right place...

I've come to the busiest restaurants in the city with limited seating, not one single restaurant would do that to their paying customer. This restaurant clearly does not deserve anyone's business."}
{"text":"Setting: Modern and rather spacious. Clean and hygienic. 

Service: Semi-self service by ordering on paper and then presenting to wait staff. Seems rather unnecessary of a complication to me but it works. Food arrives on time and staff are polite.

Food: I ordered the special pho and summer rolls and my date the seafood pho. Portions are rather big so obviously I ate both. Summer rolls are unfortunately rather thick-skinned and a bit of a chew to get through. Pho broth was excellent, very umami. A decent selection of fresh vegetables, although heavy on bean sprouts but light on greens. Chilli comes unsliced. Meat and fish was very tasty. 

Price was a reasonable for the quality of experience. Would come back, but only if really hungry."}
{"text":"Great customer service
Great broth
Good location

It seems like they could use more business, but it might have something to do with the Korean place and Japanese restaurants beside it. 3 asian restos in a row? Who thought that would be a good idea?

Update: 
They have really inconvenient hours. I love pho, and wish they were open on a more regular schedule."}
{"text":"My wife loves this place, so I wouldn't dare give it a bad review. We end up here for her birthday and for Mother's Day twice every year.

The last time we went (Mother's Day), the service was excellent and three of the four of us were entirely satisfied with the food. The only exception was the person who ordered the fried rice. The vegetables in the fried rice were clearly frozen mixed vegetables. 

Really? Frozen mixed vegetables? Is that the best you can do? Frozen peas I can understand. But there is no need for frozen carrots in any restaurant dish. Moreover, green beans and corn have no place in fried rice. I am 100% confident that your chef will tell you the same thing."}
{"text":"Definitely \"cheap prices and great quality\" from Saigon Bistro, yay for normally priced pho in Charlotte! 
Parking lot is small and location a little out of the way, but service is friendly and quick. 
We started with fried tofu, which reminded me of Taiwanese stinky tofu (a very acquired taste, yes it stinks) in texture, but not in flavor or odor. I actually enjoyed it because I hadn't had tofu made like this in a long time. However, I don't think I've seen this type of appetizer at other Vietnamese restaurants before, of course, though, they did make it themselves, so maybe it's just a restaurant specialty.
For my entree, I ordered the Grilled Shrimp Bun. The shrimp were grilled perfectly, but lacked flavor other than the flavor from the grill, however, no biggy, hoisin sauce makes everything better. The noodles could have been cooked a tad longer, but the overall mix of veggies and fish sauce was delicious. Portions were pretty huge (3 skewers of shrimp!) and a rather dramatic Viet soap played in the background. Good times. 

I'll be back Saigon Bistro."}
{"text":"The food has gotten better.  Also with the new wait staff the service is much better.  Still better to avoid the weekday lunch hour.  The pho is good but you won't find the internal organs versions. The appetizers are pricey but good quality. The pad Thai is the best in liberty village. All versions."}
{"text":"Saigon Bistro has been open in Liberty Village for months, but I could not find it on Yelp, so I added it.  Yelp prompts for a review in creating the new business record, so here is a brief one.

I would not say that Saigon Bistro is at the top of my list of eateries in Liberty Village, which makes this review my first one below the maximum of five stars (any time I have to spend on writing a review is usually saved for my favourite places).

The food here is okay.  Today, I had beef on vermicelli and the cuts of beef were average to mediocre (gristle, hard bits, overly chewy hard fatty bits, etc.).  My last visit was better (I think I had a lamb dish).

I went with a couple friends.  We went in and sat at a table.  It took a while for the staff to notice us and initiate servitude.  In their defence [sort of] I can say that we came in near the end of the lunch rush (~1PM) - the place was nearly full, but in the process of thinning out.  The staff is nice and courteous.

Saigon Bistro has a nice selection of food - different kinds of noodles, curries, meats, etc.  Their Vietnamese coffee is as good as any I've had.

They also have plenty of booze - beers, whiskeys, bourbons, cognacs, etc.
One thing I was disappointed in not seeing was an XO cognac.  Despite Luxury Village's propensity for pretentiousness, the only place where I have found XO cognac (among many other very fine spirits that no other places seem to have) is the Academy of Spherical Arts, which is within eye-shot of Saigon Bistro.  You'll be torn between XO cognac and Asian/Vietnamese food if that is the combination you seek!

Saigon Bistro's interior and décor is also nice.  There are standard tables & chairs, booths, and an outdoor patio in front.

All in all I would say Saigon Bistro is worth a try.  Some might say the prices are a bit inflated, but this place is located in Liberty Village, so it's to be expected."}
{"text":"Crispy quail with that salt/pepper/lime juice dip...absolutely like crack for me. Could barely stop in order to eat the pho, which lived up to my standards (I think--it was hard to taste it with all that zesty salt/lime flavor still on my tongue from the quail). :-)  Tender meat, perfect noodles, FRESH sprouts bursting with moisture, green basil (not blackened) and large, thinly sliced jalapenos.  

AND they're open in the mornings, earlier than some. Woot!

Don't judge it by the exterior...not prepossessing. But the interior is pleasant and the service was kind and swift.  Also, they have a garden patio off the interior--would probably be lovely on a warm day with the fountains fountaining and all."}
{"text":"Family owned mom and pop shop. It is always a pleasure to eat here! Not a lot of GF options, but I usually get the chicken and vegtable soup with no noodle. The broth is to die for. The staff are super friendly and helpful and the food is fresh. I keep coming back...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with some friends on a weekday. The place had a few tables full, but wasn't overly busy. It's clean and service is average (food came out at different times, which was a little awkward, but not uncommon). 

I ordered the chicken pad thai which was a huge portion (definitely good enough for two meals), quite flavourful, and had lots of chicken/tofu on top (I actually preferred the mix of chicken and tofu instead of just chicken. All in all it was relatively cheap for how much food it was. 

There is a complete veggie menu, and the menu is quite large. They also have alcohol if you are so inclined to drink."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time during my lunch break and didn't know what they had. Surprisingly their menu was a lot bigger than I expected as only 2 pages were posted up online. I figured I'd take the photos of the menu to help promote. Their food was fresh and was made in a timely fashion. Portioning  was good. Will def be coming back again."}
{"text":"So I've worked in Liberty Village for 4+ years and this is the 1st time I've stepped into this place.  I always wanted to go but for some odd reason, I just defaulted to sandwiches, burritos and fast food.

I want to make this clear that Saigon Bistro, menu-wise is not a pho place.  After reading the menu, I'm left with the impression it's South East Asian food that's been elevated and catered to a more broader audience.  Be prepared to drop around $12 - $25 for your lunch.  As I was scanning through the menu, I was seeing Pho items served with Lobster, and rice platters with steaks as well.  So I got to say there are so very intriguing items on the menu.

Saigon Bistro, appears to be renovated recently, and I got to say that the interior looks gorgeous.  It's really clean looking, and the environment makes you feel really comfortable with the dark black/brown tables.  From the looks of it, the restaurant should comfortably seat 50 people (includes the outside patio).

So I ordered the lemongrass chicken rice platter which came with a side salad, pickled daikon and carrots and quail eggs.  I was intrigued by the addition of quail eggs, since I've never had them.  The rice platter ($11), presentation wise, looked STUNNING.  Very beautifully plated and I had to picture it immediately before I delved into.  As for the dish itself, overall it's a pretty solid dish though it doesn't really segregate itself far from the standard dish that I'm very well used to at typical pho places (which run around the $7-8 range).  The quail eggs were yummy and well cooked.  The only nitpicks I have with the dish is really the disporportional ratio from rice to chicken.  I know it's really odd for anyone to complain that there's not enough rice, but I feel that I must address it.  The ratio for chicken to rice was like 3:1.  It was a small fancy pyramid rice mound that was served with 2.5 chicken steaks.  While I was happy at its generosity, this disporportion took me a bit off guard as I had to conservatively eat my rice so that I could eat it with my chicken.  Also, the chicken, to me, was a tad overdone/dry and I think the chicken steaks were flatten way too thin so really there's very little leeway of getting the chicken perfectly moist and juicy.  The chicken, still had a good amount of lemongrass flavour in it, so it was well seasoned for the most part.  The pickled carrots/daikon was so yummy, I wish that there was more! Crunchy, tangy and really flavourful.

The service, is VERY good.  They're extremely attentive and they stand at their \"post\" overlooking the entire restaurant ensuring that they are taken care of. Guests besides me who were being seated had their respective waiter asked whether the bill would be together or separate.  While they are not overly friendly, they get the job done well.  Plus they poured me water right away when I asked them to.

So, after over 4 years of finally breaking the silence and actually having my 1st time there, I think it's safe to say that I'll be there again.  And again.  And...well you get the picture."}
{"text":"This is the other top vietnamese restaurant in clt. The other is Lang Van. 

Saigon makes their own tofu so it is always cooked to perfection. Plus all the vegetables are crispy and delicious.  I would recommnend ordering something off their chef's special menu. You can't go wrong.

Their pho are large and packed with meat. This is the place if you want non-greasy pho. Plus only 6.95 for a bowl. Its a WIN-WIN situation"}
{"text":"The broth here is definitely the highlight of the pho I had here. I suppose being used to Chinatown pho it wouldn't be too hard to do that, but it was a real pleasure not having to throw in copious amounts of hoisin and Sriracha into my soup. 
I had the oxtail pho, which had 4 really big slices of oxtail and even more beef slices to top that. I had initially thought they were on the pricier side until I saw the amount of meat in my pho. The service is a little slow because at the time there seemed to be only one person handling the store, but nothing I would deem horrid. 

Also, the crunch on their rolls was on point"}
{"text":"The soup was standard, service OK, and choice of utensils amusing. After a few bites of Vietnamese soup with a regular spoon I asked the girl to please give me a bigger soup spoon! I was grateful that she brought me one right away. 

It wasn't the best soup I've had but it wasn't bad. The broth was mild, clear and had a good taste. The noodles were angular, rather than round. Perhaps a rectangular cross section shape. 

Soups are usually available in three sizes except for the chicken broth soups. I wanted the war wonton but asked if there was pork in it, which I didn't want, she said yes. So I decided to try the rare beef pho. I didn't find it outstanding but it was ok. 

I went at 1 pm on a weekday and it seemed like a good place for a working lunch, suitable for conversations. Also, they were playing the Days of our Lives with subtitles on a TV screen. Hope is still on that show. Not sho' 'bout Bo tho."}
{"text":"Had grilled chicken and rice.  Everything was good but for the chicken which was over cooked. Apart from that great service. Food came quick. Good for lunch very filling."}
{"text":"We have visited th Saigon Bistro twice. The first time was for my mom's birthday 2 years ago and we were a party for 30. The second was for her birthday this year and we were a party of 6.

Both times the food came out quickly and the servers were all amazing. The place was busy both times with pick-up orders when we were there and our server was still super friendly and didn't rush us with our orders.

We ordered a set menu that had wonton soup, steamed rice, fried rice, curry, chowmein, salt and pepper shrimp, dumplings, spring rolls, and beef stir fry. We also ordered bubble tea and 4 orders of their banana spring roll with vanilla ice cream. Everything tasted great! I have no complaints on any of the food and I really miss that dessert.

I cannot comment on the soup quality(Pho) as I don't usually order that. But the food we ordered was great and the service was exemplary. The restaurant is also clean and presentable.

Would definitely come back for more tasty food from Saigon Bistro when we're around the area."}
