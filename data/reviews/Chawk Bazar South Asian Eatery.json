{"text":"This restaurant truly blew me away. I went with my wife, and we both enjoyed everything. The ambience was really nice, great vibes, great music.    We tried a bunch of stuff from the menu. But what impressed me the most were their house made drinks!  For Appetizers, we tried the Phuchka and Bihari Sliders, simply mind-blowing!   For our mains I had the Chawk's Rissoto. It was probably one of the tenderest Lamb Shanks i've had. It comes with their signature pickle and an eggs fritata. A hearty portion for the price.   My wife tried Duck 420, and we've already decided to bring both of our parents to Chawk Bazar to make them try out the Duck. It's the perfect amount of flavor and spice.   We were sad to hear they were out their nihari, as I've heard great things about it. So we will definitely go back to try that.   I highly recommend this place. Giving it a 10/10. It's the perfect Fusion of South Asian and Comfort food. A heaven for any food lover. The flavors are amazing, the portions are huge, prices are reasonable and atmosphere is really homely."}
{"text":"What a nice place! My favourite was the drink, Goan Green and dessert, the Paan Kulfi! I would visit again just for these two items.   For mains I ordered the Haash Bhuna which came with polao, haash bhuna, daal, and pickled eggplant. The portions were really reasonable for the price.   For appetizers I had the Chot Puti which was good too. I would like to try all the other appetizers on the menu next time.  Customer service was great. The owner Fahim was very helpful. Great place to visit!"}
{"text":"I have a done take out a couple of times but both times I loved the food. Husband and I do eat out a lot and also do a lot of take out,hands down this is our new favorite. Quality ingredients , traditional dishes but with some twists and some pizzzazz and presentation. I like that each dish  has a different flavor meaning that they are not using the same base for everything .,,that's a good thing! Next time we are going to eat in the restaurant . I really want to try the lobster pulao and the paan kulfi."}
{"text":"Ambience: Excellent (great spot for a date, or going with a small group of friends)  Service: Ecellent (the owner is very hands on) Food: Excellent (try the Grand Iftar while it lasts, appetizers are to die for. We also got complimentary tea, which took me straight back to my early days in Bangladesh. That's a good thing, just FYI) Price: Very reasonable Conclusion: Excellent (highly, highly recommended)"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the price wasn't.   - pawni puri 4/5 tasty. Light and falvourful with the tamarind sauce..Filled with warm split peas  - fish pakoras 2.5/5 ...hardly any fish. I've had better.   - eggplant - sweet..perhaps made with mango. 3/5  - lamb shank ..seasoned well, moist and flavorful.. 4/5   Was it worth 56$+tax ??....hmmmmm maybe cause of the lamb.."}
{"text":"Two reviews with five stars each. Here's a third. Honestly, Chawk deserves it. I go out to eat quite a bit, and I try to eat at as many new places as possible because I get bored easily. This year, with my birthday around the corner, I've been in a bit of a food slump because I feel like I've had many of things Toronto has to offer already. Chawk ended that slump. I can't stop gushing.  First, the inside is beautiful. Very chic, very modern, and very Instagrammable. Second, the service is super friendly and super helpful. Even before we ordered, complimentary lychee mango drinks were given to us. What an indication of the meal to come!  The food. THE FOOD. I can't say enough good things about the food. If I don't hit the character limit for this review, I'll be super surprised.  Chawk has two appetizer platters. Both of them are stunning and come on a wooden board. Both of them consist of entirely different options. Each come with 4 appetizers, and cost $15. The chawk platter came with phuchka (pani puri with mashed chickpea inside), mini singara (almost like a samosa), bihari sliders (beef kebab on fresh flatbread), and macher tikki (fishcake). Oh. And chop suey fries? Think really thin, delicious, fried potato string garnish.  Phuchka - You fill the phuchka with tamarind water and you down it fast. Otherwise, it leaks out. It's meant to be that way. Savory, refreshing, slightly sweet, slightly tangy.   Mini Singara - Almost like a rounded samosa. The potato and chickpea filling was very fluffy. I appreciated being able to see the layers of filling in my singara. The tamarind sauce was tasty as well.   Macher tikki - I was skeptical. Fish cakes aren't my thing. Usually over-breaded and over-spiced. Not the case here. Thin breading. Could still taste the fish under it. Crispy. Flaky. Served with a spiced mayo.   Bihari slider - three/four bite taco sized. AMAZING. You could taste the beef through the spices. The carrot/beet/onion strings on top helped cut some of the richness, and the flatbread was so fluffy! I could make a meal out of these babies and be super satisfied.  Then comes our main. Just one between the two of us because the appetizer platter was so large. All day breakfast. Interesting. Lamb shank, frittata, steamed spicy potatoes, tart eggplants, stuffed parathas, fruit chaat, and an egg done our way. Also $15, and also served on a board. Well, a board and a plate, cuz the lamb shank wouldn't fit onto the board. Our sunny side up was done right. Oozy yolk. Plus points for crispy brown edges. I've got to hand it to them. Every curried food item we had tasted distinct. No base sauces here. They're all different. The potatoes weren't masked by the curry. I'm a sucker for Indian eggplant dishes and this one didn't disappoint. The fruit chaat was like a yogurt filled with berry bits and spices. And I mean filled. Loads of fruit in here. I rather enjoyed it. Didn't know frittatas were Indian. This one was tasty though. Also quite fluffy. Big chunk of broccoli on top. The least Indian tasting food we had, but tasty nonetheless. The lamb shank. IT WAS HUGE. Biggest lamb shank I've ever seen. Also tender and smelled incredible. Great indications for taste. I can't say enough good things about it. A bit of the egg, a piece of the lamb, and a bit of the eggplant on a piece of their paratha and you've got one heck of a bite! The leftovers are going to be amazing.   And there were leftovers. But then we had dessert. This birthday girl thought ahead. Asked about birthday specials. Secret menu? The key to my heart. Deep fried kulfi. Um... Woah much.  We had the fried kulfi (malai/milk flavored) and the paan kulfi (because what is paan?). The paan kulfi was interesting. Was told paan is a leaf that is usually filled with spices and then chewed after a meal. Good to know, but no clue what it should taste like. In my mind, that means I have to try it. It looks like pistachio. It tastes floral and minty and is subtly spiced, but I couldn't tell you with what. It was definitely interesting. The fried kulfi was all about textural contrast. Creamy kulfi with a crunchy fried exterior. Not too sweet. Not too breaded. Very enjoyable. Dessert was free (presumably because birthday) and they still made it beautiful. Long rectangular dish, berry garnishes, gooseberry garnish, cinnamon bark strips, little sprinkles of spices. The aesthetics are just WOW.  $30 plus tax and tips for so much amazing food. Bang for buck plus service and ambiance makes this easily one of my new favorite restaurants in Toronto, and I've only had two dishes on the menu. I can't wait to come again and try the rest. I wonder if tomorrow is too soon..."}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant that does justice to Bangladeshi fusion food. The interior is tastefully done, and service is also very good. We had reservation for a group of three on a Thursday evening. The restaurant was very easy to reach, and we were seated immediately.  The menu is not very long, but every item on it is solid. Or should I say, every item we tried were solid. For appetizer, we got the Chawk platter, which was really good. For main we had the Duck bhuna, Sea Brim, and Lamb Risotto. Each of the mains stood out on their own. The portion size is adequate, and the presentation is also tasteful. Finally, for dessert we got the paan kulfi, and I have to tell you, it is a must try.  We really enjoyed the whole experience and would definitely return. I have heard good things about their Ramadan Iftaar specials. Cannot wait to try it out.  P.S This is my pet peeve, and probably irrelevant, but I check the cutlery and dishes used in restaurants that I dine in. In this regard there is not a single place in the GTA that a South Asian restaurant has been able to impress me. Chawk Bazaar on this regard has done very well. I am very happy that they have paid attention to the minute details."}
{"text":"After being recommended by a friend went for iftar followed by dinner. The ambiance was great but the food wasn't that great. It was kind of okay. This is one of the eateries that I'll visit once only. I am yet to taste their Goan drink and the most advertised paan kulfi so may be I'll visit the place once again for those two items. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Excellent Place to visit with friends or hang out with a date.  Service: Awesome. However, it is a small place. When we went there was a large group, they were standing even they have empty seats which is annoying for other customers.  Food: Excellent!!!1Grand Iftar included Appetizers which are tasty.  Entree: Lamb shank and beef achari both were good.  Desert: Rasmalai was not the best but kheer was good.  Price: Very reasonable  Conclusion: Overall highly recommended"}
