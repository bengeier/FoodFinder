{"text":"Came in here for WIFI access. Turns out to be a gem. Clean, little coffee shop with great service. It serves all kinds of syrups for Italian soda as well as for coffee. Almond milk and soy milk as a substitute for dairy milk are available as well. The shop had some pretty tasty pumpkin chocolate chip muffin for the Thanksgiving / Halloween season."}
{"text":"Couldn't even try the coffee. Website, Yelp, Google, nothing updated to show that they changed their hours and were closed Sunday now. Won't be back since I have no way of knowing ahead of time what hours they've decided upon for the month. Drove out of my way only to arrive and find them closed despite all online resources saying they were open. Be professional and keep your online resources up to date."}
{"text":"We moved to Fountain Hills 6 months ago. We are accustomed to the daily coffee at the local coffee houses. Very disappointed with served coffee in Mountain View Coffee. Today, St. Patrick we were hoping  will be better coffee. Unfortunately not,  my black coffee was very gritty, cappuccino was again not how cappuccino should be. They have no idea how to do espresso drinks - latte, cappuccino... We also ordered a 100% Fruit Smoothie,  ...  was made with syrup and not the fruit, disgusting."}
{"text":"My new favorite local joint in Fountain Hills. Really love the menu items and the service is awesome! Support this local gem and see what I am talking about!"}
{"text":"I have to admit that the Chai from here is incredible. Great tasting and comes close to trumping Cave Creek Coffee Company's version of a great summer drink. However, charging over $5 for a SMALL blended Chai with soy milk borders on outrageous when similar drinks at Coffee Plantation, The Coffee Bean price a lot less.   As well, I've found the service lacking. From questions about the varieties of coffee they serve to asking my drink be made a certain way always seem to elicit an unfriendly response. i.e. I'm putting him out by asking the question/request"}
{"text":"Good espresso and a nice view of the fountain if it's cool enough to be outside.  They are pet-friendly.  The obvious highlight of my trip to Mountain View Coffee Co, however, were something like \"flax seed bites\"--I forget the actual name.  But they were cookie-type bakery items which had featuring a ton of flax seed, I'm guessing some almond and vanilla.  Tasted amazing!  And available for the low, low price of 75 cents!  Now THAT is a deal!"}
{"text":"The new owner of Mountain View Coffee in Fountain Hills is doing a fantastic job with the place! Great coffee as always, but the daily fresh baked goods (must try almond twist and turkey, provolone, pesto croissant sand.) are the star here.  Decor is a nice change from before; a cleaner Scandinavian update from the owner. Fast becoming a meeting place in Fountain Hills, both social and business.  You have to get there if you, like me, were sad to see the shop empty for so long."}
{"text":"Went in at 11:50am on a Sunday to grab an ice tea...there was a guy waiting to have a drink made so I stood in line next to him. The guy making the drink didnt say anything to me...another patron walked in and they started chatting it up...I guess I was invisible... I left..."}
{"text":"Don't be deceived!  The food is from Costco, that oven isn't baking anything!!  Just bought the Halloween cookies yesterday myself from Costco and saw the apple bars and cinnamon rolls right next to them!  Why??? I just don't get this place!!!"}
{"text":"Stop in here after dismounting the aluminum steed up at McDowell Mountain Park. Great coffee, free wifi and excellent view of the giant fountain on Fountain Lake. A lot of old people and rich people, but hey, this is their territory."}
{"text":"Finally!! Thai food in FH.  The Golden Chicken Currie was delicious.  Lunch service was friendly and prompt.  I recommend Mountain View Thai."}
{"text":"I always wonder what this place would do if they ever got absolutely SLAMMED. I ordered 1 Thai dish and an iced tea today and it took them 7 minutes to ring me up - not exaggerating. I was the only person in there. The cashier literally rings people up and walks into the back to cook your food. What if a party of 12 walks in for lunch? I don't get it. I keep going back because their food is incredible! The Panang chicken is the best I have ever had. I'm rooting for them, but still, genuinely curious how they would make it work during a lunch rush, lol."}
{"text":"Right on the town green with the fountain. Nice home style place for coffee, with an outdoor seating area. Drawback (a big one for me) is the smell of cooking curry that permeates the place. The owners are friendly."}
{"text":"Do you enjoy treats from Costco? Then you came to the right place, because that is what they serve here.   My husband and I stopped by this coffee shop while resorting in Fountain Hills. It was cute with a nice view, but the coffee was so unpleasant we only took a couple of sips. I also found the little treats to be tiny and quite expensive, but the woman told us how healthy they were- packed with seeds and nutrients and soo delicious so we bought a few different things.   Well, fast forward a week and we are at Costco doing our shopping and I find ALL of the little cookies and muffins from the coffee shop.   Really?   We won't be back. I would rather not spend triple the price for Costco bakery items."}
{"text":"Sweet little shop, great service, great location and awesome espresso. Try their cappuccino it's delicious"}
{"text":"I just got the house coffee, and it was mighty tasty. I loved the calm and friendly atmosphere. I wish I could have hung out longer. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Solid Massaman Beef and both of my boys loved it.  Chilli Duck was also very delicious.  Looking forward to try Pad Thai and Pad See Ew when they are available."}
{"text":"Not a legit place for coffee. Poor selection for breakfast. Those who make drinks and serve food are handling cash and coughing in their hands without washing up."}
{"text":"What a great surprise. Went there for lunch and ordered the chicken curry. Nice spice level. Friend ordered their green curry dish which she found too spicy. I was surprised that we weren't asked the spice level. Very small menu, five or six items which I think may change regularly. Enjoyed the ice tea."}
{"text":"Ok.  Have to edit my rating and review.  Originally rated MVC a 4 based on my experience yesterday which I believed was with the owners.  Well, I was wrong.  Today I encountered the owner, who had a lot of repeat customers today with the street fair.  She was not very friendly.  Expressed frustration with the way staff the day prior had made coffee,  or how they priced it.  She corrected staff in front of customers and blamed employees for her confusion.   We'd go back but would be praying for her employees to be there and not her.    original post: Pretty good coffee and wonderful, friendly owners!  Pastries mostly seem to be from Costco and there were none of the homemade scones advertised, but still very clean and tasty.  Would return."}
{"text":"I've had a meeting with a CEO who wanted to drink something with boba in it. He specialized in international business and was craving something Asian. He raved about the Yelp reviews and convinced me he was confident this would be a good meeting spot for us especially since he knew my love for boba and good coffee.  So we met there early in the AM and unfortunately the place was closed. There was a sign on the door, just like a few of the other reviews have stated.  Since then, I have gone 2 other times and ordered the iced Thai coffee with boba. Don't know what was going on with the young man and lady working the counter but during our small talk of ordering and paying, all they could converse with each other about was how tired they were with opening early. Needless to say, they didn't pay much attention to putting hardly any boba or ice into my Thai iced coffee.  About my Thai iced coffee with boba...I barely got any boba, ice and the iced coffee had no flavor. It tasted just like water but with boba.   Not sure how you can mess up such a simple drink sold in fast food kiosks and stands in third world countries but I assure you that for the price tag of this drink, I'd much rather have an iced Chai latte from Starbucks."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this little shop! Good coffee, great pomegranate green tea, good scones.  We were at the hotel across the street, so this little place was perfect for us.  Also tried the breakfast sandwich-solid.  I liked the seating, some couches,  tables, bar tables, and outdoor seating. Staff and owners were friendly and capable."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of Fountain Hills, we almost missed it. We glad we didn't because it was delish  Highly recommend this place. Everything was done with love.  I am from Brazil and if you are looking for a good bowl of Açaí, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great coffee and espresso Clean and nice Hospitable too Good lactation to relax Nice back patio and views We make a point of stopping We visit often as a day trip out of Scottsdale Thank you for being there  We wish you the best An asset to the community"}
{"text":"Adorable coffee house!  Great coffee.  Try the red-eye.  Fountain Hills is a beautiful small town."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop!!! Great views of the famous Fountain Hills fountain. Loved that they offered a non-dairy/soy option (although coconut milk is even better than almond- hint hint) ;) Truly enjoyed meeting and greeting the retired patrons, so sweet!!!"}
{"text":"So good to finally have authentic Asian food in the hills!   I had the red chicken which is the spiciest dish on the menu. They tried to warn me. But I surprised them when I added more pepper to it and teased me when my nose started running. Lol  Anyway. The red chicken is complex but simple. There are a lot of flavors going on from the ginger, the Asian Basel, and curry..  But, the most important thing here is how fresh it tasted. And fresh is what fountain hills is lacking.   The new owners were very friendly, told me a bit about their food philosophy (yes. That's a thing) and their history.   They also have a very talented barista who has been at that location under previous ownership for quite some time. She's a character!  Very friendly and outgoing!    That means they still have their coffee selections as well as some of their old menu items such as sandwiches, breakfast burritos, and pastries.   Great location next to the \"world famous fountain\".   They're open till three but may expand their hours once the slow season is over and will also be expanding their Thai menu somewhat.   Anyway, Welcome to the neighborhood!  Glad you're here!"}
{"text":"New owners have really improved this business offering coffee, cold drinks, pastries and more. Highly recommended with excellent customer service (they really care about how you want your drink) and a wider selection."}
{"text":"I feel terrible leaving a bad review, especially when I assume it's a family business. Went in on a Sunday morning and there were two other people dining on the patio and one person came in to order a coffee to go, so not busy. First the gentleman at the counter seemed nervous and unsure of what he was doing. No biggie maybe he's just a bit high strung, he was friendly enough. I ordered two smoothies that were on special BOGO half off. Somehow this took 25 minutes and the gentleman who took our money made them. He walked back and forth from a mini fridge to the back probably five times and looked confused. Not sure why you would put something that difficult on special? Reserve those specials for food you can quickly get out. So far these things were the least of my concerns. My concern was the woman who worked there coming from the dining area (which was noticeably dirty) to the kitchen to help all while licking her fingers, taking cash, taking a card, not washing her hands and making drinks for patrons. There was a 3 year old(their child) who wandered from the dining area into the kitchen while the mom continued to yell \"be careful there is hot water\". Couldn't tell what was happening in the back with the smoothies but based on how dirty the place was we took them and threw them away outside. It literally felt like ordering drinks in a strangers dirty kitchen. Super odd. I was super bummed because they have a great location and a great patio. If you want coffee or breakfast do yourself a favor and go to DJ's down the street."}
{"text":"This special oasis has so much heart and soul.  I had espresso and a breakfast croissant, and it was the most nutritious, delicious and scrumptious breakfast croissant I've ever had. The people running the cafe are lovely. I'm so happy they are here!!!! Welcome and tell your friends and family."}
{"text":"Was visiting the fountain with some out of town friends and came across this coffee shop. Great location and staff and great selection of drinks as well as free wi-fi. The shop is long and narrow but seating is comfortable and modern. I would definitely ask Ashley to whip you up a drink. She made an excellent Milkyway one for me. I'm not a coffee fan per se but for anyone in the Fountain Hills area,  this is a great location to go to."}
{"text":"Ohhhh, Noooo!  They're closed.  I really liked Mountainview and will miss them VERY much!"}
{"text":"A great place for that morning or afternoon coffee!  Clean with a great waitstaff!  Some interesting pastries to enjoy with coffee!!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow  Amazing Thai food being served now in this quaint family owned coffee shop  I'm coming back .... And back .. And back !!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambience, tasty, traditional coffee, and kind, helpful service. Modern-style coffee house with a gorgeous view. Great hot chocolate, pleasant cashier woman, and robust, rich roast. Great experience at Mtn. View Coffee!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute coffee shop, tucked in the far corner of a strip mall. It has a nice interior - local art on the wall, floor to ceiling windows, a television shoved to the back near a small outdoor patio. Very comfortable. And they sell the largest croissants I have ever seen here with a nice offering of muffins, pastries and breakfast sandwiches. The latte I ordered was light, so if you are a fan of espresso, note that during your visit."}
{"text":"Every thing they make here is done with care and focus. I had the Thai ginger chicken and it was  a perfect balance of ginger, chicken and veggies.  Most places chinch on the protein and load up on the produce. Not here"}
{"text":"love to support local businesses in fountain hills.... but this is off our list.    Coffee was terribly weak and the pastries were Costco like.   Sat outside on the patio - what should have been a million dollar view felt like a neglected alley.  Hate to say no-go.... but our experience was so poor we will not be going back."}
{"text":"So sad!  I look forward to Mountain View Cafe when we come to visit from Chicago 4 x a year. Still has awesome views and is in a great location. But since it was bought out it has gone down hill tremendously.. I was there last week to get a chi tea and coffee and one of there pastries..  I couldn't believe when I first came in how dirty!!! it was.  Unkept, cluttered. I went up to the counter. The owner (i assumed) was in the kitchen looking haggard.  Mind you its August and it wasn't busy.  She looked at me and continued to do what ever in the kitchen not even an acknowledgwment. I rang the bell and she came out.  I didn't see any energy bars, muffins. Just hard looking scones.   I asked if they make anything other than what was in the display, she said no nobody wants them, so she doesn't make them!?!?!?!?   I ordered a Ti Chi and a coffee. The ti was just ok. I guess the coffee was good my husband didn't have any complaints.   I went outside and all the chairs and tables were so gross!!! Dirty from spills and food...   I haven't  tired the \"Thai\" food. But if I wanted Thai food I wouldn't be going to a coffee shop! :-0     Its so dissapointing to see the condition this place is in.  I hope if and when new owners come in they will take more pride in making this place what it used to be"}
{"text":"The summer time in Fountain Hills, AZ can be brutal on businesses.  I'm glad this coffee shop, under recent new ownership is here.  The place is neat, clean and the service staff is extremely attentive.  Must have read previous reviews on service - and acted on it.  I love, love, love their egg breakfast sandwich: freshly cracked eggs, great ham, the cheese is really fantastic and you get two (2) eggs!  Priced under $6.00 it's a steal and it tastes fantastic.  The coffee is good too, I love the ambiance.  Give it a try, it'll grow on you.  The owners are trying real hard and it's showing."}
{"text":"Such a cute place to grab a small bite and drink. Love the smoothies they offer. My opinion is to stop by, grab a drink and walk around the lake.  They are always nice there also. Fun place to go visit."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful little shop. Locally owned. Their coffee is AZ local and pretty good (better tasting than the Bux). Espresso is fantastic. And right next to an amazing park. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"This place charges for water in Arizona , the staff is incredibly rude and took the money and put it in the tip jar."}
{"text":"Yummy coffee at an independently owned place. It's right by the fountain, so there are great views. They give a discount to the high school kids, which puts them one above Starbucks. Plus, they have card and board games!"}
{"text":"I went for a walk around the fountain today and thought I would stop in and grab a latte for the drive home. I was so disappointed with this place. I ordered a 16oz almond milk latte. They gave me the wrong size cup (smaller than I paid for). You could hardly taste the espresso. It was almost as if the barista forgot the shot all together and all I got was a cup of very expensive warmed almond milk. Temperature wasn't hot like you'd expect even if it was done properly.   The kids working were rather slow. They apparently forgot to brew fresh coffee and the guy in front of me had to sit there and wait while it brewed. A coffee shop that runs out of brewed coffee... They didn't really seem to have had adequate training. That being said they were very friendly.    I feel bad because I really like to support small local businesses but if that's what you get from them I'd rather (and will continue to) frequent Starbucks up the road.   Would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Delicious thai, their coffee is wonderful,  the owners are very sweet and hospitable, and, what a view!!!"}
{"text":"3/18/13 - wanted to grab some coffee before our walk. Stumbled on Mountain View Coffee Co. Barista was extremely friendly. Coffee was good. Iced tea (pomegranate) was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Very sad I have to give this place two stars. I was so excited when a new boba place opened here in town. I've been here numerous times hoping the service and the drinks would be better each time- unfortunately this wasn't the case. The boba was mushy soggy and was not the proper texture. The Thai Tea was barely sweetened. The service here is very slow even if you're the only one in here. I waited almost 15 minutes for my tea after they messed up the first order. (I had repeated I wanted my tea with coconut milk and non dairy.) If this place wants to succeed it needs to step up. Too many mediocre places in town that could be great end up closing due to poor customer service and or food & drinks. Looks like I'll be sticking to my usual place in Scottsdale :("}
{"text":"Hmm, where to start.. 1. The woman taking my order could barely understand the menu...  2. There's absolutely nothing original or special about the coffee menu...  3. I got a vanilla latte that ended up making me feel sick after (bad milk? bad something? I don't know)... The only other coffee that makes me feel sick is Starbucks.  Overall, I should of just bought a bottle pre-made coffee and saved myself a tummy ache and a couple bucks. Yikes!"}
{"text":"They serve  Dr. Smoothie, so I know the smoothie would be wonderful.  Staff was very friendly,  will make this a regular stop after hiking."}
{"text":"I just enjoyed a nice morning at Mountain View Coffee at Fountain Park. A generous warm homemade cinnamon roll, fresh dark coffee and a great setting and friendliness made for a great stop that I recommend to others. Say hello to Belle the gracious new owner whom you'll recognize by her warm German accent. Did I mention Mountain View Coffee has the best location in Arizona with views of Mountains, World Famous Fountain and adjacent to the popular Fountain Park walking paths."}
{"text":"Post running fuel.  Since they changed to Thai cafe last year, I've been wanting to try here but never seemed to be able to come here when they are open.  When I was running yesterday, I saw the open sign despite of published after hours. Around 9 miles of running, I went inside asked if they would be still open later. They were staying open late to catch customers came for downtown event. I left asking them please stay open for another 30 mins as I will quickly finish running.  After finished running 12 miles, I was really happy to see the open sign. My mind was on boba for the past 3 miles. There are no other restaurants in the area selling boba drinks. My choice is to either drive to Mesa or make my own at home.  I picked taro as my choice. Figured that has the most amount of proteins (still not that significant but better than zero). I really like taro flavor. Taro boba tasted so good, just what I wanted. Wish they put more bubbles but I am not complaining. Just happy to have one here.  I also tried their sticky rice with mango. My favorite Thai desert. Can't go wrong with sweet sticky rice with coconut milk over. They added generous amount of mango, I nicely rewarded myself for running 12 miles. I might have consumed almost all the calories I burned but that's okay. I am not trying to lose weight.  Owner was very friendly. Small family owned cafe. Happy to support locally owned small business."}
{"text":"Love this place! Coming from Washington state, I was nervous about moving and not finding a place that makes good coffee.. but this is definitely a gem in Fountain Hills with a beautiful view of the fountain! The coffee is great and the owners, Ronnie and Victoria are the sweetest couple!"}
{"text":"this place is the reason why i had the wonderful idea to open my own coffee shop.   they have quality coffee, not bitter, very smooth.  they have cute names for the drinks.  though i don't like banana, it's rad that the banana mocha is called the monkey and the engineer.  their pastries are very large, decent price.  haven't tried them though.  they close at 6pm, so it's best to just stop by in the afternoon, sit out back and just chill."}
{"text":"Stopped in once for an iced coffee, and it was quality stuff.  A little pricey but enjoyable.  The decor is so Fountain Hills that I had to chuckle about it.  Retirement quotes?  Amazing.  I'll stop by again next time I'm in town, but won't go too far out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find out that this is now a Thai cafe! There isn't a huge selection but they have the important stuff: curries!! Thai ice cream! Boba!  I had the Penang curry and mango and coconut ice cream and they were all inexpensive and delicious. Not the best I've ever had, no, but it's worth it to not have to drive to Scottsdale for Thai food!"}
{"text":"Since this is the only place to get boba tea in town, I knew I had to try it. I wish they had Jasmine milk tea, my favorite, but I was fine with getting the Thai tea with boba, since it's another flavor I love. The boba itself wasn't bad and the tea was pretty good. Around $5 for a medium seemed a little pricey, but the service was quick and the quality was there. I'd probably go back for another Thai tea."}
{"text":"We loved this coffee shop two years ago when we moved to FH and then it was a little tough for a bit while the new owners found their footing but now it's awesome!!! It's location on the lake is great too.  If you haven't been here lately, go back! Hazelnut cappuccino was sooo good...they started sourcing their coffee from  local scottsdale roaster. I'm a Starbucks junky but this coffee is sooo much better!  Also love love their Açaí bowl for breakfast! 5 or 6 different fruits, granola, frozen açaí coconut milk on bottom...yum! They also make 6 or 8 different kinds of healthy little cookie balls with chia, flax and lots of other goodies.  And the cafe doesn't smell like curry at breakfast anymore...smells like coffee :-) love curry for dinner...just not breakfast. But remember...FH is a beautiful small town...this is slow food and coffee is made fresh by the cup...be patient."}
{"text":"Best scone I've ever had. Came fresh out of the oven. Husband loved the breakfast sandwich. Great scenery and owned by a husband and wife that are very welcoming."}
{"text":"This is just the kind of place Mike and I love with indoor and outdoor seating, friendly staff and good coffee and tea and free wifi.  Serving some hot and cold foods as well it's a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Holy Authentic Thai come to Mama!!! The food was to die for (Golden Chicken Curry & Tom Kha Soup). I was very impressed. The presentation was beautiful and the owners were gracious. Only criticism is that the rice portion could've been bigger I was with some hungry Cambodians and the pointed that out, but overall Bravo!! I can honestly say this easily the best Thai Food in Fountain Hills & Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place was very busy and the only place in Fountain Hills for Boba Tea, so I was very excited! Unfortunately, I was sincerely let down.   We went for breakfast. After standing in line for more than 15 minutes, I ordered a boba tea and a bagel. I was told because the business was so busy, they weren't serving food, only drinks. Um, what? A restaurant refusing to serve food because they are busy? In what world does this make sense? My boba tea was nothing more than a bland smoothie with tapioca balls at the bottom. Not going back to Mountain View."}
{"text":"My new spot for coffee/treats in my 'hood!! Can't believe it's taken almost 5 yrs to try them out.  Excellent view of park and fountain, sets MVCC above Starbucks locations, IMO. But, I really dug their genuine customer interaction/service, and options. I have only tried their hot cocoa bc it was around SuperBowl time and was FREEZING in AZ. It was truly delightful.  Plus, I almost feel like I'm in someone's kitchen when I go to sit down. Someone nice and wise. Like maybe my Gramma's kitchen. Love the feeling it gives me. I'm sold."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to Fountain Hills! The food is good, the service is friendly, and the coffees and teas are brewed strong.  My favorite are the boba teas, with the Taro boba being my absolute favorite.  A great place to stop after a hike or a walk around the park."}
{"text":"So happy that this place has reopened with a lovely new owner. Perfect location, delicious coffee and pastries. Everyone in Fountain Hills has to go check it out!! Beautiful!"}
{"text":"UPDATE 4/8/16 - last week, I posted a photo of a 'closing early today' sign that was up for a few days. Earlier this week that sign was exchanged for a hand written \"Dear Lovely Customers\" sign that said they'd be open on Friday, April 8th. Went for a walk this morning and that hand written sign has been replaced with a computer generated \"sorry\" sign. They will reopen tomorrow, the 9th, as Thai Cafe (I believe they mentioned being called Mountain View Thai Cafe)."}
{"text":"Good service amazing coffee! Great atmosphere. Take a walk around the park and wait for the fountain to flow."}
{"text":"Decent espresso. Cool to have an owner operated place.   Pretty slow service/baristas though. If there is just one person in front of you, prepare to wait about 5-10 minutes.  Would love more healthy food options.  Dog friendly patio out back."}
{"text":"Great locally owned coffee shop and restaurant. Better coffee than Starbucks and a much nicer view. Ronnie and his wife make a good team and make you feel welcome every time."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time a week ago (visiting my parents who just moved to FH). A++  Great location, view of the fountain, outside seating, nice decor inside, really wonderful owner and a big menu of pastries, croissant, sandwiches, Italian sodas, and coffee.  I had the egg salad sandwich (the croissant and egg salad was SO FRESH!!) with a side of potato salad was probably one of the top 3 potato salads I've ever had!  I also got an iced mocha which was just the way I like it, on the sweet side.  I had my 14 month old daughter with me so I also shared the potato salad with her and ordered a yogurt with granola.  This was no ordinary McDonalds yogurt parfait - it was so delicious I had to have some too!  One gripe (that could be easily fixed by the owner) - PLEASE BUY ONE HIGHCHAIR for your guests to use.  We would love to come back often (as we go see grandma/grandpa) but I can't take another lunch with her on my lap:)"}
{"text":"My husband loves Thai food and we have been unable to find a good restaurant since Char's at University and Rural in Tempe closed years ago. We have tried many Thai restuarants in the Valley and have had some good experiences, but no restaurants have served up great fare consistently. But this is the place! The food was authentic, fresh, delicious, and seasoned perfectly. We ordered the Penang Chicken and Pad Thai Wraps. Both dishes were heavenly. We will be back again and again. Too bad they don't serve dinner, only lunch."}
{"text":"The Açaí Bowl was delicious.  The fruit was fresh & the açaí was flavorful & refreshing.  I prefer the granola to be a little sweeter, but other than that, it was great to have this in our town!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife stopped in for some coffee and breakfast this morning.  I would consider this as an average place to stop into with a no frills approach.  The signs on the wall gave us a chuckle and the owners seemed a little spacey except for some of the regulars.  We regretted not trying the pizza place behind here which was packed for breakfast and had coffee for a dollar"}
{"text":"Don't go here for coffee!! The coffee here is VERY bitter and their prices are OUTRAGEOUS! $4.15 for a medium cappuccino?!? I would rather go to Press Coffee Roasters in Scottsdale for better coffee! All the pastries  seem like it just came out of a box from Costco! A breakfast sandwich for over $7? You could get a whole breakfast next door at Euro Pizza for that much!"}
{"text":"I had a smoothie. not a coffee but it was nice and the woman that runs the place was really friendly."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: I was fired today from Mountain View Coffee.  As an employee?  Nope, as a near daily, year-long customer who dropped $7-$10 per day and always tipped - interesting, huh? I'll nevertheless attempt to be balanced here.    Pros:  Charming, cozy surroundings, good espresso, a few very tasty home-baked items made by personable, hardworking young staff members. Male co-owner also unfailingly friendly, great with customers and staff.   Cons: Food overpriced - particularly the baked goods from Costco. Lunch sandwiches made from scratch but overpriced ($7.25 for egg salad, really?) Worst Con: Female owner with astonishingly bad attitude. Openly chastises her employees, is suspicious of customers, incredibly stingy, and, as another patron observed, creates an \"unpleasant, negative atmosphere.\"   Why was I fired?  For having the temerity to complain.  This woman appears to dislike feedback of any kind, but an actual complaint sends her reeling. One day recently when I mentioned my \"loyalty card\" (buy 10, get one free) had not been stamped earlier, she gave me a distinct \"you're lying\" look.  I asked to speak with her today and explained  hat her reaction of mistrust offended me. When I further observed that she seemed to trust no one, her response was, \"I don't\".  Wow!  Great attitude for a down-home coffee shop owner.  Bottom line - nice place, but keep any observations, complaints or even constructive feedback or suggestions  to yourself.  And whatever you do, don't ask for your loyalty card to be stamped."}
{"text":"The new owners have changed quite a few things.  The thai tea and thai food are a great addition and I am really excited to have a local place for boba tea! The coffee and tea are very good and the staff are friendly.  The only issue is that if you want a quick coffee this might not be the place.  I have had to wait up to 10 mins for my drink during busier times."}
{"text":"This place is just ok. One of the things I really like is the fact that they have almond milk. That's unique and I hope Starbucks will follow.  I went here and ordered an Americano. It was really good and didn't taste burnt...until I got to the end where the drink was very gritty. The cups they use are also really cheap and burn your hand even with the sleeve on it.   I went in right before closing, which is at 5pm. The bathroom was kind of dirty and there weren't any paper towels. Stuff like that annoys the heck out of me. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it's because they were busy due to the Great Fair being in town.   I also liked their POS unit. I know that sounds kinda geeky but they use the Square where the employee rings up the item, flips it around and you enter your tip amount and sign with your finger. There are no annoying receipts or anything like that. It's pretty cool if you ask me."}
