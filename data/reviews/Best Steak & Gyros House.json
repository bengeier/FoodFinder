{"text":"Consider this place a mid flight refueling station between the downtown nightclubs and a night in jail somewhere in the Heights lol  Definitely not a place for the faint hearted. I usually frequent the place late hours(2:00am-4:00am crazy huh?). The food is typical greasy spoon but good. The gyros are really good too. They buzz you to the restrooms through a locked door at the top of the stairs(apparently to control the vagrant piss population). They are conveniently located in an abyss of a catacomb basement piss trough(it may be better to wet your pants and stay alive than to chance it...)   OH! ....and be sure to tip the local hustlers waiting outside. Cheap insurance and a distraction for a clean get away!"}
{"text":"It's a very reliable place to go especially when you don't want to make breakfast in the morning The prices are very reasonable and the service is awesome and fast. The only thing I would say is that I don't like the amount of homeless people hanging around but you really can't do too much about that due to it being open 24 hrs....and they don't beg for money so I guess it's OK!"}
{"text":"For Case Western students (or maybe just my friends and I), Best Steak was Legen-wait for it -dary. Drunken nights were usually concluded with gorditas from the Taco Bell right across or the vast array of delicious breakfast centric offerings from Best Steak and Gyro.  I'll be honest. I dont entirely remember their menu except for a few meaty omlette flashbacks. You dont come here for the food, you come here for the experience.   While I have only been inside at 2am or later under questionable judgment, I remember the owner (who also mans the cashier) being hilarious and an awesome conversationalist.   I also remember the self proclaimed \"Boss\" that would invariably be sitting at at a table every night, selling DVDs and proving they worked on his small personal laptop. After many, many encounters with \"Boss\", I consider him a great friend. Someone who will always sell you a DVD that is working.  Go to Best Steak when you are hankering for food (and some social extracurriculars) after a long night"}
{"text":"- You're better off playing the lottery at that place than eating the wings which aren't that good at all. However despite the bland decor and unsatisfactory wings,  Best Steak and Gyro does some things well. The breakfast specials featuring sausage, bacon, home fries, and eggs however you want them is a HUGE plus. Also the steak specials aren't too shabby either. To be honest you may want to get your food to go VS eating in the restuarant, but either option is ok."}
