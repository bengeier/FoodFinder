{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere and service. We stopped in for a late night bite after a show at the music hall and they were even playing the artists' music! Talk about know your customer. Would heartily recommend."}
{"text":"One of our favorite stop-ins when on the Danforth. A quiet, intimate spot with yummy meals and a great variety of beer! What can be better. Great for a date night or meeting up with friends. The food has been consistently good, thought some items are portioned smaller than you may expect, so just ask the super friendly staff. 
Daily specials have also been pretty great. 
We love the nacho's, the are well distributed with all of the fixin's. Other favs are the mac and cheese, the burger is pretty good - and I'm a picky burger girl. 
Great atmosphere and service. Pretty while casual!"}
{"text":"Had some pulled pork nachos that were among the best I've had in Toronto. Great selection of beer too!"}
{"text":"This place is a great little neighborhood bar! Great food, great drinks (the Caesar was so delicious!), and amazing service. Can't wait to go back here, either to watch a game at the bar or to have a nice meal out with my girlfriend!"}
{"text":"Great local spot with friendly staff, reasonable prices, nice menu choices and good tunes (not too loud so you can actually have a conversation). Fave is their chicken schnitzel with spätzle that is sautéed to give is a nice crispness and taste. Had it twice now and consistently great each time."}
{"text":"Cozy place. Stopped in for a drink on a Friday night. It was busy, but not packed. Decent beer menu. Not a ton of seating, wouldn't bring a large group there. There's bar seating, table and a few seats at the windows. 

Service was good. Gets loud in there when it's busy. Music was playing, but you couldn't hear it very well over the chattering of the lively groups. 

Would love to try the food, the reviews look fab!"}
{"text":"Really really friendly place to drink on the Danforth. Wandered in here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city after a long day at work. It was vinyl night so there were some great tunes on like Kenny Rogers, Lou Reed and others. I had a great talk with the bartender about rare vinlys and it turns out they do this every week. What a great spot. Some nice local beers on draught and specials on tall cans.

{"text":"Cozy little neighbourhood bar that opened up a couple months ago in the Danforth area.  Good list of classic cocktails and beer on tap. They have a shorter menu going right now as they are transitioning with chefs but I'm excited to see what their proper menu will look like.  They also have two rotating taps!"}
{"text":"Just discovered a lovely  little restaurant on the Danforth that used to be a German one. Loved the ambiance and my seared haddock was delicious. Prices of alcohol also reasonable!!! Great place to have dinner prior to concert at the Danforth Music Hall. Plan to come back for sure!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim for late night dinner. Great owners who are personable, friendly, and welcoming.
Chicken schnitzel dinner (with browned butter sage spätzle) was fantastic. Converted my non-schnitzel loving partner into a lover. So we get to come back!!!"}
{"text":"A new \"local\" for the Danforth. A serendipitous discovery before a concert at The Music Hall and a very welcome addition to the Danforth.  The Edmund Burke is a friendly and unpretentious eatery that is a hybrid London/New York neighbourhood \"go to\" place. Eclectic and friendly. Our first visit met with personable staff who did their best to meet our concert timing, along with recommending great ice cold local beer, Sidelauch from Collinwood. Affordable wines by the glass. Limited drinks and food menu but selected with care. We had excellent burgers, side salad with slices of fresh radish and house made vinegrette. We will return, concert or not."}
{"text":"Great little intimate place that's great for drinks and pub fare. I came here for a friends birthday and it was wonderful, we had a great time. The staff is friendly and they know how to make great drinks. The selection of local beer on tap is great and they have a guest tap that features beer from local microbreweries.

The poutine was amazing! They make a great Old Fashion and excellent Manhattan. I will definitely be visiting this place regularly."}
{"text":"Came here on a weeknight before a concert next door at the Danforth Hall. Strolling along, my friend and I decided to drop in here for a drink and some grub. 

The Eddy Burke has an inviting atmosphere that's cozy, chilled out and easy on the eyes that encompasses the true pub feeling. 
They've got a great selection of drinks regardless of what kind and they've got daily specials. For food they've got a great-limited selection that provides EB to focus on quality and presentation. 

Keeping it simple we both order a glass of wine to compliment the nachos and poutine.  Both were in-house made, portioned and overall enjoyable. 

Overall we had a great time, the service was excellent, the place was clean and cozy."}
{"text":"Great new local. Dust off your old vinyl and have it played on Tuesday night.
Have your barkeep, Brody, mix you the best 'Old Fashion' in town!
Promises have been made for a killer patio coming this summer."}
{"text":"Sweet Baby Jesus this brunch was perfection. Served from 10:30-3:30 on Sunday and quite possibly the best breakfast I've had in Toronto! Think gastropub without the wait times or pretentious vibe. Good music, chill vibe and excellent service by the bartender. 

I ordered \"The Standard\" (eggs, bacon, delicious garlic rosemary potatoes and homemade brown bread). My boyfriend had the \"Eggs Purgatory\" which was quite possibly the best brunch plate I've ever stolen bites from. Turkey, pulled pork, ground beef, egg amazingness- so amazing I decided to write my first and likely only review of 2017. 

Will be putting the Edmund Burke and Eggs Purgatory on regular weekend rotation!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Edmund Burke. Been for dinner, drinks, and breakfast several times and each has left me happy. I've had the burger a few times (tasty) and for breakfast have bounced between a traditional offering (eggs, meat, toast, homefries) and the specials (some great omelettes). Staff is fantastic as well, very warm.

Highly recommend! For what it's worth, when I search online (or here) for breakfast/brunch options in the area it doesn't come up for newcomers to discover. Might be a profile adjustment *shrugs*

But seriously, check it out."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to explore Danforth and stumbled upon this gem to celebrate our anniversary: attracted by the $6 wine special, we walked in and discovered a quaint cozy dining room with only about 30-40 seats and possibly the best burger I've tried in 4 years living in Toronto (stole a bite from my husband). Flat brad was flavourful and I especially enjoyed the candied walnuts that added a punch of flavour to the prosciutto and the goat cheese. With different specials every night, we'll be sure to venture out from the Village many more times."}
