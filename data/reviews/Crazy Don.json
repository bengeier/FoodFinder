{"text":"I really enjoyed it!  I will say my husband would probably give it 3-4/5, but I loved my food and the excellent service!    We had lunch there, yesterday, and I ordered the avocado tofu salad.  Ample portion and very good quality ingredients.  The dressing was light and flavourful.    You know...with some places...you get a feeling as soon as you walk in, good or bad.  Well, I felt comfortable right away.  Then, the servers were so welcoming, and the food was tasty.  It really was a pleasure.  I will gladly come back.  What a great find!"}
{"text":"It's a donkatsu restaurant but the donkatsu was terrible.. Kimchi fried rice is better. I found hair in the food and I told the server but she just threw it out. She didn't anything for me. I don't want to go anymore"}
{"text":"Spacious layout with trendy minimalist interior, I came here for a late night dinner with my super intelligent and handsome boyfriend. I had the bulgogi udon which was extremely flavourful and he had the hamburger steak which was equally delicious and came in a generous portion. Service is polite and friendly. I would go again :)"}
{"text":"I walked by this place and decided to give this place a try, knowing absolutely nothing about it. The decor was very fresh and trendy.  Came here on a Saturday night with a party of 2 and we were immediately seated.  We went on and ordered the cheese kimchi fried rice bowl and the omelette fried rice. The portions of the entrees are pretty generous and the our surprise it also came with some side dishes and miso soup.  The prices are reasonable and relative cheap given the area your in. Overall the food was not bad but there are a few dishes that are quite unique and the presentation was beautifully done.  The service here was also amazing, very friendly and speedy waitresses.  They came by several times to refill our water without having to ask.  I would definitely come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"The service was so baaaaaad, nobody offers menu and water. Never come again. Half Korean half American style food are all taste bad."}
{"text":"They have a great variety of dishes. It's not really traditional Korean cuisine, slightly modified (dishes with cheese and side dishes that are pasta salad).  The portions are large and the price is reasonable. Friendly service. I think this is a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"Came bak after 7 months. It seems like the menu changed and apparently the owner changed as well. I got the crazy combo where i get beef patty(fried egg on top), pork or chicken katsu and a fish chip with rice and salad. I gotta say everything is just at mediocre level. Not lower or higher but it just tasted what it supposed to be. Since there are so many korean/japanese fusion places, i expected something special but nope.   Environment was nice. Quiet and comfty.   Servers were nice as well. They know their stuff.  Overall, some taste improvements on their cuisine would be nice."}
{"text":"DON'T GO HERE. We had so many issues with our dinner tonight.   For starters, after having been seated for about 10-15 minutes, we thought it was strange that we didn't get our little side dishes that everyone else had. Nobody was interested in taking our order either. We had our menus closed for ages and numerous times the servers rushed past us. We finally had to flag someone down. Then we got 3 side dishes and our soup.   Meanwhile, I noticed a table who had gotten there after us and had ordered essentially the same meal was getting their mains.  We waited and waited and waited. I typically expect simple food like this to take about 15, max 20 minutes.  At the 20 minute mark, we asked about the status of our food. That server never got back to us. 10 minutes later, we asked another and at this point also said we didn't think our food would take this long and needed it to go. 10 minutes later, no response and no food. At the 40 minute mark, a old Korean man silently gave us some soggy edamame. Past 40 minutes, we once again asked a server where our food was. He said, \"It's coming.\" At about FIFTY minutes, we finally got our food in a to-go pack.   There were no apologies throughout this process.  When we paid by credit card - TO OUR HORROR - the only options for tip were 15%, 20% or 25%! There were no other options! We had no cash, or else we would have tipped less or none. No wonder the staff were so inattentive, they were getting minimum 15% no matter what!  I have NEVER BEFORE thought of never giving an establishment a tip before (I'd also never given a 1-star review before). However, considering we had to flag a server to take our order, our tea was never refilled, our food was ready 50 minutes in, we never got an apology during this time, we never even ate our mains in the restaurant and the fact we only got an apology when I, rather testily, asked if this was normal - I would consider this next to zero service.  We have never had to take our entrees and leave a restaurant without eating. We have never been forced to tip a minimum of 15% for being ignored and hungry. It is appalling.   When I finally got home, the food was okay.   Just. Don't go here. The service is poor, the food is fine, the ethical standards are low."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with my wife as my friend recommended to try the rib plus kimchi fried rice combo ($20 excl tax) .  Portion size was huge but taste was a huge disappointment.  Rib was something you can get at any fast food restaurant with thick sauce ( very artificial taste) and fried rice was very oily.  My stomach felt uncomfortable when i goy home..Not worth the price i paid for.  Will not be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Dish was so so. Poor service. And expensive considering the quality of the food. Just new interior. That's it."}
{"text":"My least favorite katsu place.. Name of the place is crazy don and their katsu is CRAZY NO GOOD... It was 7:30ish and fairly busy but i did not expect my katsu will be that bad... I had original pork katsu and very disappointing... no flavour, soggy, breading falling off from the meat... ok service... Other food might be good(since i have not try them), but I won't go back for their katsu for sure. Ill give 2 star for their clean interior. Nothing impressive..."}
{"text":"We ordered don katsu and chicken katsu. The food came out after 45 minutes which is unheard of. On top of that the don katsu was not even hot like the dish was just sitting for the past 30 minutes. People who came later than us were served the same menu before us.  When we complained about the service the waitress told us to the food was coming and than another 10 minutes of waiting. Sorry but I would not come back here again."}
{"text":"3-3.5 stars. I came on a Friday during lunch. Didn't have any trouble getting a seat. Although the yonge and sheppard area seemed more quiet then usual, perhaps people have started their march break travels. Anyhow the restaurant was busy but still had available seating.  They had 4 wait staff so no issues with getting served. The restaurant is nicely decorated so ambiance was quite comfortable. Now the food...I ordered the curry pork katsu and my friend ordered the Alfredo pork katsu. They first serve you a bowl of creamy pumpkin soup. Soup to bowl ratio here was pretty bad. I think my bowl was less than a quarter full. At least use smaller bowls or give more soup. The soup was quite nice. I think I tasted potatoes in it too. They also give two side dishes kimchi and pickled something. I recall the taste of the pickles but I couldn't figure out what it was. It reminds me of bamboo shoots. Now the mains, the size of my pork katsu was huge. As big as the plate but also very thin and crispy. The scoop of rice was good but slightly on the small size. Its about the size of an icecream scoop. The cabbage and salad that came on the plate was pretty good, it helps offset the grease in fried foods. My friends was the same pork katsu. The only difference between ours was the sauce. I thought my curry sauce was OK...its on mild side. I didn't like the mushy potato's and carrots in it. I think it would've been fine with out it and if  the sauce was more rich. The Alfredo was nothing too special just an unusual combination. I still think this place is worth a try. The prices are not too bad aroud $12-15. I would definitely come back to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend. We lined up for ~20mins to get a seat for two. During the 20mins, none of the servers came to ask us how many people, we waited until a table left and that was when the server came over.   I've passed this restaurant quite a few times, and it usually isn't that busy... But I guess we went on a Friday night and peak dinner time.   I was very surprised that the food was better than I expected. I got the chicken teriyaki, which came with green salad, rice, two grilled chicken breasts. The chicken wasn't that great.. But oh wells the sauce was delicious.   My friend got the crazy platter! That was AMAZONG !! It came with a pork and fish katsu, hamburger patty with fried egg on top, macaroni salad, coleslaw, cabbage salad! The portion was big, and filling!   I'm giving it a four star because I think the staff should try to learn how to approach customers when there is a line up out their door. We were kinda confused."}
{"text":"Very bad experience, I don't recommend this place. This place is very understaffed, only two people are working, poor & super slow service. My friend waited 25mins for her sushi roll and I waited almost forty minutes for my Japanese style stir fried udon. The quality of the food is also not good wrt the price. I will never go again."}
{"text":"I went there with my friends for dinner.   We made reservations well in advance. Got seated once we got in. Most of us ordered Chiken Katsu or Don Katsu. Others ordered Kimchi Cheese fried rice and a beef dish.   Everyone was satisfied. The owner/chef came out to greet us [which was nice].   We also got special service because we were a large party. Just an appreciation from the owner. Gratitude can go a long way.   I got the Curry Don Katsu. It was tender and crispy. The portions were on the plentiful side. Definitely a place you come hungry as well.  Side dishes were fresh and complimented everyone's dish.   Had an awesome experience. Will come back."}
{"text":"Crazy Don is a solid place to go if you're craving general asian fusion, but not particularly picky about your flavours or in a rush. The service is always slow, they seem a little short staffed, and the food is always good-not great, not the best in the neighbourhood, and a little pricey for the amount of food you get, but it gets the job done. Clean place, often has room for big groups."}
{"text":"I'd give this place no stars if I could.  I went with my friend and our food took forever to come. When it did, only hers came. Mine took another 15 mins and only when I asked about it.   I ordered the chicken katsu curry. When it finally came, it was COLD.  I told the waitress that my food was cold.  The response I was given was that \"I can microwave it for you if you like?\"  If I wanted my food microwaved, I would have eaten at home.   What kind of service is this."}
{"text":"Who? 2 girls & 1 guy in mid-20s When? 5pm on a Sunday in late March Why? Peering in from the outside, portions looked big, and all the dishes were neatly presented; so we stumbled in  How (did it look/feel)? Modern, well-designed, with 3 tables against the floor-to-ceiling front windows. Restaurant was half filled and a lot of tables had ordered katsu dishes  What (did we order)? 1) Beef kimchi fried rice + kalbi ribs combo - Fried rice was flavourful; well portioned to fill one person - Kalbi ribs slightly undercooked so although it was tender, the meat stuck to the bones 2) Grilled spicy pork bulgogi - Very flavourful; not too spicy, but with a kick to it; a little oily Free) Sides: miso soup (salty), potato salad (okay), coleslaw (good), kimchi (spicy), pickled something (no good)  Would we return? Definitely, to try their other dishes"}
{"text":"The down fall here is if you drive you gotta pay for parking. The parking in the lot next to kinton ramen for $7 or they have street parking.   The restaurant wasn't too busy when we went for a Saturday night. No wait for a table of two. The food was okay here. Nothing too exciting or amazingly delicious. We got the agedash tofu to start. It was flavourful and delicious. I got the cheese omelette rice. It was pretty god, but nothing special. The portions are big. I couldn't finish my rice so I have some left overs for lunch on Monday !   Overall the food was good here. Nothing special. I wouldn't come back if I had to drive and pay for parking. The prices for food are decent minus the fact that you have to pay for parking."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened recently so this review is based on an early visit. The kitchen will likely evolve and hopefully improve as they gain experience and receive feedback.   The highlights: Chicken Katsu is perfectly breaded and crispy.  Curry flavour was nice.  Kimchee is fragrant and sweetened with apples.  Sushi rice served with meals is good.  Meat portions are large for both Chicken Katsu and Hamburger dish.  Decor is really nice.   Needs Improvement: Calamari breaking was puffy and tasteless. The accompanying chips acted as a plate filler. The chips tastes better than the Clamato.  The hamburger was overly salty and had a burnt taste. Also seemed really greasy.  Hungrier people will find that rice serving isn't enough.  The amount of soup served with meal seemed small compared to bowl size. One of these should be adjusted.   Coleslaw salad was just okay. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I think the restaurant is under new management. They now serve Korean and Japanese food. I ordered the original tonkatsu because I thought it was their signature menu. Unfortunately, they do not specialize in tonkatsu anymore. The meat had some juice but was hard and under-seasoned. Also, the batter came off from the meat even before I touched it. It was greasy overall, and I could not finish it. It was a shame considering that the portion was very generous. The homemade tonkatsu sauce did not impress me, either. It was so watery and bland that I wondered if it was supposed to be soup. Any store-bought sauce would have tasted better. I would not recommend getting tonkatsu in this restaurant. It was clean inside. The servers were super friendly. I may come back to try their new Korean and Japanese dishes, but it will be a while from now."}
{"text":"Convenient location near Empress Walk. Nicely decorated and brightly lit, has a little farmhouse feel with all the wood furniture and wall decos.  They have a large food selection ranging from chicken/pork katsu (cutlet), sushi rolls, korean stews and bento boxes. Also have quite a large selection of local and korean beverages.  Dishes: Chicken Cutlet with Cream Sauce Sweet Potato Cheese Pork Cutlet  I've tried tonkatsu from other locations before and the portion size and plating looks similar - 2 big pieces of katsu, a coleslaw, potato salad, and a small dollop of rice. The meat is fried nicely - crispy, tender and not greasy. The cutlets are very large, probably good enough for guys but too much for some ladies, so I suggest sharing dishes. Love that the sauce comes on the side so you can dunk as much or as little as you want. You can also switch up the sauce if you order something different.  The sweet potato cheese cutlet is stuffed with lots of mozarella cheese and the sweet potatoe paste is wrapped in shiso leaves, which gives it a fresh taste.  The cream sauce is cheesy and tastes like parmasean. The sweet demiglace tastes kind of like borscht and tomato sauce, would prefer it to be a bit more like gravy / salty.   Suggestion: Maybe do a dipping sauce platter of all 3 sauces so can switch up the flavours a bit. Also, a spicy dipping sauce would be great!  The appetizers (miso soup and kimchi) came right away. Miso soup is kinda cold and can be more flavourful. Had to wait about 15-20 min for the katsu to arrive.  There are 2 server but there's a bell system. He answered in korean when we asked for service and wasn't quite attentive.   Decent place for a filling dinner. Make use of the special discounts if you eat early."}
{"text":"Eh, I dunno. Odd experience here:   Came on a Sunday afternoon with my two nephews. The ban chan came out and I tried the kimchi. It tasted off -- sour, almost. Didn't like it at all.   Ordered bibimbap and a spicy salmon roll. Along with the bibimbap comes a container of \"bibimbap sauce\" that they put on the table. I put some of this sauce on my dish, tried it and - again - it tasted off. This is now the second item I've had here that doesn't taste right. I'm starting to worry.  Tried my spicy salmon roll and, AGAIN, it tastes off. Not good at all. Is it just a lower quality salmon? Or is something going on here?  Honestly, at this point I worried the food was going to make me ill. No joke. I didn't finish either dish.  The rest of the afternoon/evening I waited in fear of getting ill. Thankfully, I didn't. But this experience was enough to make me not want to return. This is a shame, because I liked the 'vibe' of the restaurant and our server was very nice. But three things tasting *not quite right* is not good at all :/"}
{"text":"crazy don is best described at kfc/ Japanese fusion food. eveything is served with kfc sides such as green kfc coleslaw and macaroni salad. i must admit when i first read the menu i was excited to try many dishes, but it was a sad dissaapointing expensive experience.  i really do not recommend eating here. the dishes are severely overpriced and the food quality is very poor.   the starters and service were good which earned the restaurant a 1 star rating.  we wanted to go the ramen place two shops down however it wasnt kid friendly so we ended up at this place without any research. i am a foodie so i normally research places i eat before wasting my money, which i totally feel like i did today. a simple lunch costed us $65 for 3 dishes, 1 cup of green tea (which was not authentic, it was a regular tea bag!!!) and 1 can of pop not even served with a glass of ice.  dish 1: udon alfredo seafood dish. it was the best dish out of three but i wouldnt order it again. the alfredo sauce tasted out of a jar not home made. the noodles were good. some of the seafood was so rubbery that i couldnt swallow it.    dish 2:  kimchi bacon rice with ribs.  the ribs were good actually, but no one liked the rice. it was so spicy that we couldnt eat it and no bacon was found anywhere in it.  dish 3: hamburger topped with cheese and an egg served in a cast iron frying pan. the beef patty and sauce was gross. my son only ate the egg and normally he would eat a beef hamburger without a problem.  for these 3 dishe a whopping $65 seemed too expensive for non authentic, non homemade food. fushion, my ass!  you cant just slap some ingredients and sauces together with a side of kfc coleslaw and call it Japanese fushion. this place needs to concentrate on creating some authentic dishes with homemade sauces and sides."}
{"text":"--- My First Impression ---  I walked by Crazy Don multiple times and noticed they always had a very long line up. I was hoping to give it a try when they had a shorter queue. My friend and I happened to be around North York on Victoria's Day and was lucky enough that there was no one lining up. The store design was very modern and had a lot of wooden decor.   --- Food and Drink ---  My friend and I ordered 2 dishes:   1. Kimchi Cheese Cream Rice Cake (Chewy Rice Cake cooked with creamy Alfredo with mushroom, green onion, noodle, mozzarella and pan-fried Kimchi) $12.95  - This was one of the best Korean Rice Cakes I have ever tasted. I could smell the dish before it arrived. I saw the cheese bubbling on the hot sizzling pan. The rice cake cooked perfectly and was very soft and chewy. The cheese and creamy Alfredo sauce coated over the rice cake tasted like heaven. Even though I couldn't taste any mushroom and noodle in the dish, I still loved it a lot and would definitely reorder this dish.   2. Bacon Kimchi Fried Rice + Spicy Pork Back Ribs Combo $19.95 - I loved how the fried rice was dry but flavorful. There was a generous amount of kimchi and bacon in the fried rice. Normally restaurants provide bacon bits, but Crazy Don cooked their fried rice with actual bacon pieces. The fried rice was also cooked with green onion and sweet corn and topped with a sunny side up egg with seaweed and sesame on top.   - The pork back ribs were quite bland (perhaps the other dishes were too tasty and had a stronger taste). The texture of the ribs were very tender and I could bite the meat off the bone easily. It also came with 2 sides for this dish: a refreshing cucumber coleslaw and a macaroni salad. I personally liked the coleslaw more because it can clean up your palette. I found the macaroni salad too sweet.   The restaurant also provided two appetizers, pickled cucumber and carrot and a cold miso soup. I wasn't too fond of their appetizers though. I liked hot soup more than cold soup.   -- Overall --  I found their portion size bigger than I expected. We could not finish half of the dish. I enjoyed my visit here, I would definitely reorder the kimchi cheese cream rice cake. I won't suggest their pork back ribs because it tasted kind of bland. I would come back to Crazy Don to try other dishes for sure!"}
{"text":"Heaping grotesque portions do not make for quality food.   This place is an utter fail. The donkatsu was dry and a huge disappointment. It came with a KFC like coleslaw and potatoes salad combo with rice. The worse thing beyond the food itself was the rack that the donkatsu came on. Imagine putting a steak on a cooling rack and told to eat off it o.O  My mother tried their udon for the first and last time. She had high hopes but they were dashed when a mediocre sized bowl with very little seafood came to the table. Puzzling when the donkatsu portions were so big. As she described it \"so so, but never again\"  Also, the service was terrible. Our particular server was quiet and wondered if it was his first time serving. I guess I can make allowances there, but when asking for the bill from another server I received a rude \"yaaaap\". It's clear service is also not a forte of Crazy Don.  Also note, tables were not cleared right away and seeing the portions left on the plates confirms my experience. Nobody bothered to take home leftovers.  Can't wait for the next establishment to come in and replace this disaster."}
{"text":"Relaxing atmosphere, good people and great food. Located slightly north of Mel Lastman Square, it is very convenient to get to when getting off at the North York station. The interior is simple and kept clean with a unique decors along the walls. This place is down-to-earth and casual with a low noise level. Service was good with waiters who are efficient and relatively quick to assist you. Also if i haven't made myself clear previously, the food was great and I was beyond satisfied. This place is known for their various types of katsus (japanese style cutlet) and I was quite pleased. It had the perfect combination of tenderness and crispness. Of course it has been deep fried however it did not taste greasy. The portions I would say is quite filling and at a reasonable price. Overall, I had a great experience and therefore will return."}
{"text":"An interesting Japanese & Korean fusion restaurant, traditional dishes with some creativities.  The Cheese Kimchi Fried Rice was yum, but better to eat when it's hot, as too much cheese would make you feel greasy when it cools down.  The Bibimbap was average, unlike most of other bibimbaps that are served in a stone bowl, the one here is in a skillet, but good for rice crust lovers.  A bit overpricing but a good place for young people."}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT: 3/5 - Modern, clean, spacious. Chairs are not the most comfortable because most of them are like benches without backings and no cushioning. The restaurant could fit smaller groups and probably 1 table or 2 tableS for larger groups if they combine a few tables together.  FOOD: 3/5 - Their menu is very diverse with a combination of both Japanese and Korean dishes. You could find traditional Korean food like Kam Ja Tang (Pork Bone Soup) or Japanese sushi rolls and also a new mix of them both. They also give you a few Korean side dishes as appetizers.  I was here with my hubby and tried their Kimchi Bulgogi Fries as a starter. The bulgogi was cold and tasted like hard, crumbled minced meat tossed on top of the fries. The fries themselves were great and the mozzarella cheese was hot and melted but the bulgogi was certainly a disappointment. I also think the portion was a bit small for the price ($8.99). We also ordered the Don Katsu and Kimchi fried rice as an entrée. The Don Katsu (pork cutlet) was huge and crispy but not comparable to Katsuya in terms of tenderness and flavour. The batter also comes off from the meat fairly easily so it could be a bit messy. The cutlet also came with a sweet and tangy sauce served on the side.   The Kimchi fried rice was served on a hot skillet in a decent portion. I could barely taste the bacon bits but the rice and cheese were pretty tasty as they are. Towards the edge and bottom of the skillet, you'd also get the crust of the rice which I especially enjoyed. Overall, I think the food was average. The watermelon slices was a nice touch to end the meal though.  SERVICE: 2/5 - Here's where things get interesting: When we were offered the machine to pay our bills, the machine indicated 3 options for tips (I believe it was 13%, 15% and 18%) and with no other option to enter your own amount. I always pay my tips on the total before tax was charged. So I wasn't pleased when I was forced to pay a certain percentage in my total bill after tax. After pressing randomly on the keypads (I think I pressed OK without selecting any of the 3 options) it actually led me to a screen where I could enter my own tip. So, I ended up giving them the tips based on what the pre-tax bill was (converted in dollar amount), which I thought was fair in terms of the service I got. But the older hostess grabbed the machine, checked the receipt and ignored us for the rest of the night. NO Thank you, no smile, nothing. She just walked away. And after showing the receipt/machine to the younger hostess, who was friendly to us when we first came in, she then also completely ignored us as we exited the restaurant. We were both a bit turned off by that.  Overall: 2.5/5"}
{"text":"I figured I should give this place a chance since it's usually packed. I came on a Friday night and got my table right away.  My fd and I got the Japanese donkatsu and hamburger steak (with the sweet sauce they recommended). I'm glad I came hungry cause the portions were huge...too huge that we couldn't finish.   The Japanese donkatsu (came in 2 pieces) was crispy and tasty, but all the other sides (side salad, coleslaw and fried rice) on the plate were nothing special.   The hamburger steak was alright...I felt the sauce tasted familiar, something similar to a Chunky can :s this entree came with pumpkin soup, which I wished was warmer.  Overall service was unorganized. The waiter had to come back a few times at our table and surrounding tables to check on customers' orders and bringing the food back to the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've walked passed Crazy Don dozens of times, but never thought much about it cause I thought it was just another generic japanese place that serves rolls and dons.  It looked pretty nice inside. Clean wooden furnishings, shiny floors... Turns out it's a korean restaurant, and we were offered a few side-dishes. Only a few though; definitely not comparable to other korean restaurants that give you 6-8 dishes.  I ordered a curry donkatsu, not expecting much based on the pictures in the menu. But as dishes arrived, the portion sizes were pretty big. At last, my dish arrived and I was surprised to see two pieces of katsu, dwarfing a small mound of rice in the corner.  The tonkatsu had crispy batter and the meat was alright. Not too dry, but not too juicy or tender either. I'm not sure how I would compare it to the last one I had at Katsuya, but it wasn't too bad or anything AND THERE WERE TWO PIECES for like $12 (which is about the same as Katsuya). Though, looking at a couple pictures, some people were only offered one piece? Not sure why the inconsistency.  The curry sauce is served in a separate bowl, which I liked as I could choose how I wished to use the sauce. It tasted alright.  When paying, there was the option of selecting your own tip, in contrast to another review that mentioned there was no such option. They may have added that at some point.  Looking at some other reviews, it seems like the dining experience I had was a bit different as we were offered a bowl of rice cakes on the house. The person that suggested this place said he had eaten here several times and the waitress knows him, so things may have been a bit better as a result."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night and intended to go for Japanese Ramen but ended up at this Korean place. I am personally not a fan of Korean food but we wanted to give it a try anyway.   The food we ordered seemed decent enough and the size of the dishes we had was more than we could handle. You get quite a lot for what you pay. But I have no idea if the food was actually authentic.  The service and atmosphere were pretty good, too.   Note: I have never been to Korea and eaten real Korean food."}
{"text":"I ordered the Bulgogi Kimchi Fries and Cream Donkatsu and they both arrived in a very prompt manner. They were also very tasty and the waiters were very attentive to our needs. We never had to ask for our cups of water to be refilled. The portions were quite large and worth the price. I would recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"When I visit a restaurant, I judge it by asking myself this question. Do I want to come here again or not? For Crazy Don, it is definitely a yes.   We had curry don katsu, creamy don katsu, kimchi fried rice and dduk-bok-e (Korean spicy rice cake dish). First we were served with corn soup as an appetizer which was creamy, chunky, not too salty nor bland - really delicious!. When the main meals came, I was surprised to see the huge portions (I think it was the biggest out of all the don katsu meals I tried in Toronto). The plate included don katsu (of course) along with rice, green salad, coleslaw and potato salad. The meat was crispy on the outside and tender inside, and the sauce came separately so that you can dip the meat into the sauce which is what I prefer to do. They also gave us some side dishes like pickled radish that were perfect combinations with the food. The kimchi fried rice was really good - came in a hot metal plate, topped with mozzarella cheese, not very spicy. If you are a dduk-bok-e lover, it is a must try! I tried this rice cake dish in many different restaurants and stores across GTA, and I'd say it was one of the best here.      The atmosphere was very clean, spacious and trendy. I am quite very sensitive to the environment and hygienic conditions, and this restaurant generally had a clean vibe with well-maintained tables and floors. The location is also very easy and convenient to find, right by Yonge street near Empress Walk with good parking spaces right behind the restaurant. The only thing I'd say could be improved is the waiter's attentiveness. The service was generally good and courteous, but there were times when we were kept waiting for a while for our needs to be met. Regardless, the experience at Crazy Don was very pleasant and I'd love to return again."}
{"text":"I liked the interior of Crazy Don.  It was a cozy space with wooden block seats with elements that continued the woodsy theme.  Our miso soups and three types of banchan arrived first.  The miso soup was nice and standard.  The banchan consisted of kimchi, pickled bamboo shoots, and pickled radish.  The Fish Katsu came out piping hot from the fryer which was a good thing.  There were so many pieces of the fried pollock fish on the plate!  I found the portions of rice and potato salad that was included were too tiny though; it was like a tiny ice cream scoop sized portion.  There were a few strands of cabbage on the side.  While the Fish Katsu was very crispy and fried very nicely to a satisfying crunch, I found that there was barely any pollock fish inside the crispy layers.  It was nearly empty and after the first bite, my mouth was mostly of crispy batter instead of fish.  The Kimchi Omelette was covered with a layer of scrambled egg and also came with some cabbage on the side with tomato sauce too.  The kimchi fried rice under the egg was quite spicy and flavourful.  It came with an ice cream size scoop of potato salad as well.  We kept asking the server for refills of water that night (since there wasn't a water jug on our water) to the point that he asked us at the end of the night if the food was too salty.  We didn't think so but just that we didn't get enough water from one or two cupfuls.  At this time, I also informed him about the lack of fish in the Fish Katsu and he replied he would inform the kitchen about it.  I packed up the rest of the leftover food we had and had it two days later.  The Fish Katsu after being reheated tasted quite good and was crispy still.  I wouldn't mind returning in the future to try more dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is very delicious and the atmosphere is nice. the prices are reasonable, only issue was our server was rude. I'm basing that opinion on multiple conversations.   We got the chicken Katsu and deep-fried California roll. Both were big portions."}
{"text":"3-3.5 rating.  If you like katsu (pork cutlet), then give this place a try. Crazy Don just opened up a few weeks ago and they specialize in deep fried cutlets, but they also offer other dishes as well. It's near Kinton Ramen. As someone who loves katsu, I was really excited to visit earlier this evening and couldn't wait to try their food. It was packed when we got there but we were quickly seated by one of the servers, and there was a paper menu already placed on the table.   I decided to order the Cream sauce (it's actually Alfredo sauce) chicken katsu - 13.95. I thought it was an interesting combination so I thought I'd give that a try. My bf ordered the Japanese donkatsu - 12.95. Once we ordered, we were given two small side dishes which were kimchi and pickle. All dishes come with soup, I had a pumpkin soup which I thought was delicious, and my bf had miso soup.   So it was off to a good start, my bf was served his dish first. And I thought mine would come a few minutes after. We ended up waiting maybe about 10-15 minutes wondering where my food was. Our server came over and checked but never got back to us. Finally, after waiting another 10 minutes my food came. The waiter came and apologized because apparently they missed my order. I wasn't mad or anything because I know they're a new business and they're still trying to working out the kinks. But my bf was annoyed lol.  Anyway, I found my food to be just okay. It was good but nothing mind blowing. It was interesting to pair alfredo sauce with the katsu, but it wasn't creamy enough for me. The katsu itself was a little bit dry though. The Japanese katsu was crispy but my bf wished there were more pieces. Also, one last mishap was that we were given the wrong change and good thing we double checked. At this point, my bf was so annoyed and simply just over it but I reminded him - they're a new business! Or maybe I don't get annoyed or frustrated easily. We talked to the cashier about it and he apologized.   Overall, service was meh but food was good. I'd come back again because I wanna try their other dishes and I'm sure service and things like getting orders out will improve."}
{"text":"I was not crazy about this place.   Had the Cheese Omlette Rice and it was a disappointment. I was drawn to this dish because of the melted cheese on top of the bed of kimchi fried rice! It was rather bland and there were small pieces of meat in it that reminded me of spam or corn beef. They need to improve their kimchi fried rice.   I also ordered the katsu but forgot which one exactly. To another disappointment this katsu was a ratio of 2:1, breaded to meat. The piece of meat was thin that I forgot if I was having pork or chicken. It wasn't crispy instead tough to bite through."}
{"text":"Crazy Don was a pleasant surprise. Just north of North York Centre on the east side of Yonge Street. Only hassle is trying to find paid street parking.  To start, it came with miso soup and 3 Korean appetizers. Always appreciated.  I went for dinner. I got the Don Katsu, which was $12.95. It was quite reasonable for the portion. Surprisingly, there was quite a bit of meat - 2 full legs. It wasn't white meat though, if that matters to you. I enjoyed the breaded taste, but not too fried and the red sauce was a nice touch so it wasn't dry. There was also no bones, so you can eat with utensils and it wasn't messy.  It also came with a scoop of white rice, cold mashed potatoes, salad and a pickle slice.  Definitely worth coming back to try something else."}
{"text":"Does not have ice!! They don't have any ice! Ice is nice!     Nice spacious washroom."}
{"text":"It's close-by to my work. They have great lunch specials. My go-to will always be kalbi. They give a good amount of kalbi and its delicious."}
{"text":"Tried their fried chicken cutlet (katsu) and hambuger steak. Food is a little pricey compared to other places but the portions are huge and comes with free appetizers and soup. The atmosphere inside is nice, very roomy and the place is clean. Service is pretty good and food came out pretty fast. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I have pretty bad luck introducing my family to other cuisines. I took them for cream udon at MeNami and they said \"this is basically carbonara\". I took them to an HK-style cafe in Markham and they said \"this is basically American food\". Now, after taking them here, they said \"OK, but this is basically chicken parmigiana\".  And you know, it's not unlike a parmigiana. The demi-glace sauce tastes like a cross between a Japanese curry and a vegetarian bolognese. The meat is sliced thick and not pounded like a schnitzel, and the breading, while it might not be affixed very well, is crisp. The cream sauce, which I also got a chance to try, is a passable alfredo. If it were paired with pasta, I would ask for it to be smoother; with craggy fried meat pieces, it's perfect. The cheese tonkatsu is a take-off on chicken cordon bleu with extra melty cheese.  I haven't tried the Japanese-style donkatsu, mainly because the other items are so good. Their portions are indeed huge, but the prices are not high for the area. I would definitely return for a third visit."}
{"text":"been working in the area and went to the don 3-4 times now. service has been on point minus one mishap by forgetting to put in the order but the servers were very apologetic as it seems it was an honest mistake and compensated us with some pop. had beef/chicken teriyaki and donkatsu and the portions are large but not too much. definitely coming back if im feeling for some korean cuisine in the area"}
{"text":"Not bad. I went for dinner with a friend and had a pretty good time but it wasn't amazing enough for a 4 star.  Food: 3/5, I got the original japanese style katsu. The cutlet was crispy and the sides were good but it wasn't special and I wish it came with a bit more sauce.  Service: 4/5, it was definitely good. The server was nice and attentive and explained their menu well.    Ambience: 3/5, the seating was nice but there was this sour scent in the restaurant that was unsettling.  Price: 3/5, around $18-$20 per person so meh for me since its just rice and cutlets..."}
{"text":"Do not recommend anyone to come here-- unclear price points and have a hard time communicating with the waiters.  1. Charge you dinner pricing on weekends? $15 for a chicken curry rice was NOT WORTH IT  2. Ordered pork cutlet gave me chicken instead and automatically charged me extra.  Poor food quality and service. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I have this running joke which has proven to be true on numerous occasions that if you get below average service at an Asian restaurant the food is USUALLY really good to make up for it. This place fell under that statement. Iffy service but food was delicious."}
{"text":"Goodbye Crazy.  Please try your best to make a good food for the customers. I know you won't."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday for lunch with 5 friends. The place was not busy when we got I'm and we didn't have to wait to get a table. Before ordering, they gave us pickled radish, zucchini and carrots, and tea.   I ordered their famous kimchi fried rice with cheese because I love fried rice and cheese but I've never an actual combination. The dish was served on the frying pan itself and the food stayed hot during the entire time I was there. It looks like a lot of cheese on the pictures, it's actually a quite thin layer. Fried rice was ok - a few kimchi here and there, rice fried with kimchi sauce - the overall dish was okay - not as yummy as I thought it would be and not worth the price.   My friends ordered pork bone soup(spicy), which was worth the price as the bowl was fully filled with pork bone & meat. Others ordered chicken Katsu, which were filling and yummy.   Food (overall) - 4/5 (but kimchi fried rice with cheese  3/5)  Service - 4.5/5  Cleanliness including washroom - 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Food - overall, not too bad. If you're more concerned about quantity, Crazy Don has just that. Everything that we ordered was plentiful and filling. Quality could have been a bit better - the white dragon roll that we had was rather bland. The fish did not taste very fresh. I would say that the best item that we've tried was the kimchi cheese rice dish. It was filling and the cheese mixed with the rice was a nice combination with the kimchi.  Service - could have been better. It took a while for the server to get our orders and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. However, food came out surprisingly quick so I have to hand it to them for that.   There are definitely better fusion restaurants out there in the area. Crazy Don is, for the most part, an okay restaurant. If you ever do come in for a visit, be sure to try out the kimchi cheese rice!"}
{"text":"Okay I really hate to do this. -5 for food and +7 for the service.  Was there to chugging in something for lunch and I went there only because I haven't been in for a long time. Yes, I love fries just like all other childish adults in the city, and yes I will drool for even a chewing gum if it's deep fried. But NO if you dare to sell me a $14 deep fried oil that doesn't even feel cleaned for a long time, right next to a group of oldies calling the servers in super rude manner, treating the place as if they own the whole restaurant.  I used to go there often for meat fix back in time because the combo deal they serve (donkatsu and hamburg steak) was real deal. The day I was in, I was shocked to find they sell sushi to instant noodle as well. So regretful to find they lost the identity, but now, I know I should spend $14 to buy cigarettes, not their donkatsu."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend night around 10pm, and it was surprising quite empty. However they close at 11pm so we had to get our orders in quick. We sat by the window, which is sadly really cold as the air was seeping in. But the place looked clean, bright, modern and welcoming. We didn't have a problem ordering, I guess we knew what we wanted. However the other tables which had a lot of questions may have faced a bit of a language barrier, but the servers seemed nice.   I got the kimchi fried rice with cheese. It comes piping hot in a sizzling hot pan and its smothered with cheese! The hot pan creates a nice crispy cheese crust on the edges. The side dishes were a bit sad looking though and didn't feel it was at peak freshness. The cheese is a lot and fills you up fast, so I eve had some leftovers to take home.  They had a lot of variety on their menu, so if im ever in the area I'd probably come back and try some of their other things."}
{"text":"Favourite place around Sheppard Yonge for Korean/Japanese style food. I've been here 3 times and I haven't been disappointed yet. (twice for lunch and once for dinner) So far, I've tried their kimchi omelette rice and pork katsu (fried battered pork chop) and both were excellent. Pork was juicy and batter was in proportion with the pork cutlet. The dipping sauce was legitimate too. (not ketchup) Kimchi omelette rice was tasty as well. These portions are pretty big, so come hungry.  note: Their menu pictures do not do their actual food any justice. The actual food looks and tastes better than the picture."}
{"text":"Ordered the cheese kimchi fried rice, creamy seafood udon and a side of katsu. I really enjoyed my time here. Music they had was great ( I asked Siri a few songs XD), service was really friendly and the food was abundant (took take out from a two entree meal). I was really happy that they accommodated the specific order I had. I wanted the creamy udon seafood, but I also wanted to try katsu. Instead of me paying for two entrees and having extra sides, they gave me a different item menu price that was similar to the order I had (noodles and katsu) and I just had to pay a $1 more. It was really worth what I got and I'm so glad I got to try both things. The servers were really nice to ask the cooks and I guess the cooks were nice to do it. The only con I would have is for them to cut down on the cheese for the kimchi fried rice and make the udon less creamy. It's get sickening after eating a bowl from each."}
{"text":"Me and my friends had a great great dinner experience here. The owner was really nice! Giving us free beer coz it's one of our friends birthday. The food is also great  and worth the price! DEFINITLY recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for a late lunch one day so it was rather empty.  Atmosphere was really nice and quiet and the decor had a simple, and quaint feel to it.  Food was really good and staff was very friendly (though they got a little lazy due to the lack of customers and we had to signal for them a few times for more water!).    I ordered the cheese kimchi rice and my friend ordered the hamburger steak.  Portions were decent and flavours were good.  I also ordered the mint lemonade, which was fantastic.   Would come back to try the other dishes"}
{"text":"I think the owners changed so the food doesn't taste the same as it used to. Their bibimbap is still solid but their soontofu tastes different, watery and not as flavorful as it was before.   Maybe I went on an off day..."}
{"text":"This is a fusion type restaurant with Korean-style japanese food. I think everything was pretty good and the place has good vibes. They serve Japanese style curry, sushi, salads, and katsu. All with Korean side dishes and a twist on the taste.  It's a pretty versatile place with home made tasting foods that you can bring friends or a date along. Very casual and not too crowded like the more famous katsu places.  It's only 3 stars since again there's nothing particularly special about the place and the service was the typical Asian style of brusque/fast. Probably won't choose this place again since so many other places around the area. I think the main problem with trying to offer everything 'popular' is that nothing stands out."}
{"text":"Nothing crazy about crazy don. We initially wanted to eat at petite potatoe before catching a movie but the lineup was too long so we looked for something close to empress walk. Crazy Don has a guu kinda vibe where majority of the decor comprised of wood finishings from floor to ceiling minus the all the hustle and bustle of being full of customers. The menu sounds better than it tastes. We ordered the kimchi Bulgolgi fries and the kimchi bacon fried rice + Japanese Don katsu combo. It came w/ good sides:  honey/teriyaki potatoes, pickled daikon, and cucumbers. The fries were really good. Katsu flakey on outside, juicy in the inside.. But the kimchi bacon fried rice was totally lacking any flavour - needed more kimchi, bacon, and spice. It was so bland I would have been happy with just plain white rice. This is more or less a fusion btw korean/Japanese food and KFC. Bill was $30 for two. Overall, Would not come back."}
{"text":"\"uhh... I really don't like this sauce.\"  What time we arrived/Wait time? Arrived for lunch around 2pm and got a table fast!  Atmosphere? The atmosphere is nice. It's very simple and clean. I personally love wooden tables and such.   Service/Staff? The staff are no more typical than a regular Korean restaurant. It is just a quick order and then they usually leave you alone for the rest of the meal. That's nothing new for me!  Food/Menu? The menu has good variety. I got the regular donkatsu and the sauce was different tasting than other places. I really didn't like it. It was just not pairing well with the taste of the pork and I wished that I hadn't ordered it. I don't think I'll be going back for that particular dish."}
{"text":"Made our way south on Yonge to try something new from our regular spots. Didn't feel the food was good wrt the price and service was slow (2 persons working) . There are many other noodle type shops in the area that are better and more reasonably priced..."}
{"text":"Walking down Yonge Street to Kinton and spotted this place.  Captured by their name and went in to see how crazy this place is.  Nice décor with wood plank walls; simple and yet modern.  We were greeted and seated right away.  There was a small menu with pictures of ten items on the table.  We got the Japanese Donkatsu and Cheese kimchi rice bowl without even looking at the one page menu.  First came the three Korean side dishes and in less than 20 minutes came our entries.  They both came in big portion and were nicely presented.  The pork cutlet was crispy outside; tender and juicy inside.  Rice bowl was good as well; nothing would go wrong with cheese.  The winning dish is ...... Donkatsu! I definitely will be back again! Good service!!"}
{"text":"I myself ordered the cream donkatsu which was very very good. They donkatsu across the board with my table was not greasy and done very well. Our friend's cheese donkatsu was literally overflowing it wasn't just a little bit on top which was great. Wouldn't get the corn cheese again, it was good but not 6 dollars good. The Ade's were okay....orange ade is literally orange juice mixed with sprite for 4 dollars. The hamburger steak was really good, if you are not a fan of processed cheese ask for it off because once you get to the second steak it's covered and that can be good or bad depending on who you are."}
{"text":"Having free parking in the back was certainly one of the main reasons we picked this place instead of others tonight.  Very clean and modern looking decor, and the food was presented very nicely. However the taste was quite mediocre. There was nothing that blew me away. Good price, reasonable food, reasonable service, free parking."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time to try their Kimchi Cheese Rice. Their menu is pretty diverse with dishes from both Japanese and Korean cuisine.   I ordered the Kimchi Fried Rice ($12.95) and boy was I disappointed. This dish came out cold and the  the fried rice way too oily.  Overall, I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars for lunch.    My sister and I came in for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and the place was pretty quiet.  Only about 1/3 of the restaurant was full in a stretch of Yonge st surrounded by office towers.  Hmmm.... I wasn't sure if that was a sign of things to come but I kept an open mind.    We chose the original don katsu and the curry katsu for our lunch, one with fried rice option and the other with plain white rice.  Ordered some Jasmine tea to go with our meal as well which they charge additional $1.50 each.    The pumpkin/squash soup with corn came out first and I didn't particularly enjoy this soup.  The texture of the soup was too thick for my liking and it was too sweet I didn't think that type of soup complimented such a heavy fried cutlet meal that was follow.  Should have asked for miso soup and pay additional $1.50 again.    They brought out a small dish of assorted veg pickles and kimchi as banchan.  The pickles were much better than their kimchi which was possibly the worst kimchi I've ever had in my entire life.  I was happy that I didn't opt for any of their menu offerings where that kimchi would have been used as a main ingredient (like the kimchi fried rice, kimchi udon...etc).   Finally, they brought out my curry don katsu first and the curry sauce that a large-ish cutlet was sitting on was cold.  Uh oh...  The don katsu was the usual variety you can expect at any other Japanese restaurant and it, too, was lukewarm.    My sister's original don katsu came out shortly after, steaming hot!  Where is the consistency here?  I sampled her katsu just for comparison and you could tell that her dish was made fresh to order whereas mine just kind of sat there getting cold for whatever reason.  The ketchupy sauce that accompanied the original don katsu was also too sweet and off putting for my taste.    I'm not sure if I would go out of my way to eat here again especially with so many other good lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"Crazy Don is a place I've been meaning to tryout but finally got a chance to eat here. On Friday night, it was fairly busy but we got seated right away.   Menu has a lot of variety which is good but a lot of the dishes are good for sharing. We ordered the following: Cheese Don Katsu, Kimchi Bulgogi Fries and Kimchi Cheese Cream Rice Cakes.   The Kimchi Bulgogi Fries were my favourite out of the three dishes. Fries were crispy, seasoned well and had good flavours when mixed with the kimchi and Bulgogi. The Katsu was not impressive but average at best in my opinion. The rice cakes were chewy and soft mixed with the cheese and cream sauce, it was overwhelming. I recommend mixing this dish with rice.   Overall, service was good and attentive. Food was a little on the slow side but I wouldn't mind coming back to try the other dishes another time."}
{"text":"The good: I read some reviews that the cutlets were cold and didn't taste good, but mine (curry donkatsu) came out OK. However...  The bad: the same can't be said for the cheese omelette rice. It was just bad. Things did not go well with each other. The cheese didn't go well with the tomato sauce that they used. It's one of the first times where I left more than 1/4 of the dish. But...  The ugly: the worst was actually the appetizer. I was craving for calamari, but this place took what was suppose to be an easy calamari appetizer and changed it into chips and 6 pieces of calamari.... They didn't even go well with each other. Not to mention that the calamari tasted like crap - even when doused in sauce.  Neutral: as many post have mentioned, not sure if this place can survive yonge street area, as there are a lot of viable options - with both food being tastier and price being more reasonable for what you pay."}
{"text":"Nice interior, good atmosphere, good food, price is okay compare to all these things. would definitely recommend for those who like Korean food, Japanese food, Korean style Japanese food. I also like their soup and side dishes which comes with the main dish!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We asked for water and they forgot, so we asked again, and they came back 20 minutes later with cups that were used to hold their utensils while everyone else (who was korean there) got cups that were much nicer. They also gave every customer (who was korean) side dishes..but we did not receive any. Food was ok, but service was horrible. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I must say that the Curry DonKatsu tastes much better now than the last time I tried it, and left feeling quite satisfied after my most recent visit! The dinner came with side dishes (spicy kimchi veggies, and some pickled veggies). I really enjoyed the squash soup as well that came with the dinner. It was a very thick soup but sweet like squash and had little corn bits in it. Just like last time, the portions are still massive but this time around the sauce was less watery and had great flavour with a small amount of diced potatoes. The sauce also came in a side dish as well so you can pour to your liking without it being too soggy or too dry. The dish also came with a scoop of mashed potatoes, some salad with a great tasting sweet dressing, and a scoop of rice. The service was friendly and prompt, and ambiance is still just as great. As well, they now have a new and improved menu! Will definitely come back from now on."}
{"text":"2.5   Pros: Decent variety in menu Great service  Cons: Food is meh  This place is just down the street from where I live and I've passed by on multiple occasions.  Finally giving it a try, I was more or less let down unfortunately. The service, atmosphere and everything else not food related was great.  The food here is the weak point unfortunately.     There are plenty of seats here.  Turnover is not too bad as well.  For a place that specializes in Donburi, they have a bunch of other items to choose from as well.  We ordered the katsudon and the seafood udon in cream sauce.  A side of mozzarella sticks were ordered as well.  The food comes out pretty quickly and everything was on the table is about 10 minutes.    The presentation of the food was very well done.  It looks very good when they put the food down on the table.  The donburi was just so-so.  It just wasn't seasoned enough.  There was a whole ton of rice which made the not seasoned enough part even more obvious.  It wasn't terrible, but it could of been so much better.  Seeing as this is supposed to be your signature dish, it was disappointing.  The seafood udon was a bit better.  The only problem was it should of been called squid in cream sauce with udon noodles.  There had to be way more squid pieces than udon.  I have never eaten so much squid in a meal in my life.  If you love squid, this is the dish for you.  The service here was very good.  They have more than enough staff here to make sure everyone is attended to.  Like I said earlier, everything except the food was well above average. I really do like this place but I can't score it any higher because of the food.  If I ever hear that the food has undergone changes, i will for sure be back to try it again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favourites! The food, the place, and the service is amazing. This is my usual go to place if I'm craving for donkatsu (or pork cutlet). Their portions are pretty big as well. The donkatsu is crispy on the outside and really tended on the inside making it great.  Their service is also amazing! One time I went, we didn't even wait too long but they thought we did, so they gave us complimentary drinks. Every server was nice and displayed great customer service.  You must go here!"}
{"text":"Will not return. No issues with the food or service (although they were both mediocre, as was the value), but extremely suspicious credit card handling practices... Without going into the details, let's just say I reported fraudulent activity to the police and to my credit card company.  Btw, you can file a police report online for fraud at http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/core/fraud_under.php"}
{"text":"Came here in a whim late Friday night at around 10 (they close at 11... I hate doing that tbh :/) since our usual joint was quite a walk from where we were.   Place itself looks nice, has a Guu/Kinka/kinton vibe to it which I like. Service was quick and attentive and food was pretty good!  I had the bulgogi udon & my gf had the cheese kimchi fried rice and both dishes were good for the price point. The udon was a nice surprise - noodles were not too soft or firm, and the soup base was salted just right - and the fried rice served on a skillet made for some nice gooey cheese. The udon also had a really good noodle to meat ratio which I thoroughly enjoyed! Each dish was served with miso soup and a couple of side dishes.   Overall I'll probably be back to try their other dishes and they give me another reason to eat uptown!"}
{"text":"thumbs up! corn cheese, chicken katsu (very generous portion and cooked perfectly) and creamy croquette all delicious!"}
{"text":"Went to this place yesterday just grab a quick bite to eat. We ordered a plate of dduk-bok-e which are the Korean rice cakes, to share. Then I ordered a combo meal which came with kimchi fried rice and don katsu. My friend ordered the Don Katsu.  First of all portions are huge. We both did not expect to get that much. And we were not complaining about it. I have to admit I was not too impressed with the kimchi fried rice. However I did enjoy the pork cutlet, as it was not too dry. The sauce it came with was also very good as well. The side dishes were different then what we normally get but we didn't mind them.   The service is what made me change my review from a 3 star to a 4 star. We were seated immediately and were brought warm tea right after. The waiters were constantly filling our glasses and making sure we had everything we need. They were all very friendly."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here!   The service and food was really good and the restaurant was cute and welcoming. We tried a couple of dishes, all of which were a good portion for the price and well made.  We were warmly greeted and seated immediately, the restaurant had maybe 3-4 tables full. The restaurant is a decent size, maybe 15 tables. It's cozy and modern inside, also clean.  We ordered the bulgogi soup, the original don katsu and the calamari. The calamari was average, but it came on a bed of these delicious fresh potato chips that were still hot from the oil, I felt that they were actually more delicious than the calamari itself which had a bit of a weird batter. Might try something else next time as it wasn't my favourite. The bulgogi soup was really nice and flavourful, it came bubbling hot and stayed hot the entire time were there. The katsu was amazing. Two big pieces of pork which were nicely breaded and crispy. The katsu came with a small salad and rice and some potato salad. It also came with a sweet tomato-like sauce which was really good. The meal also started with some traditional Korean appetizers and miso soup. Our bill for all this food was only around $35.   We found the food to be fresh tasting and flavourful, with larger than average portion sizes and good prices. The service was good, water was filled regularly and the servers were genuine.   We would definitely be back here for the katsu, maybe try some other versions. We saw some people with the omelette rice which looked good!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place with my friends yesterday during mid afternoon upon seeing all the yummy photos from fellow yelpers!    We ordered kimchi fried rice, kimchi omelette, avacado and tofu salad. The prices are a little higher than I expected, but still within reasonable grounds. I personally liked the kimchi fried rice the best, served in a hot skillet, and the kimchi omelette would come second. The portions are very fair. The sauce on the avacado/tofu salad was a little to sour for me or overwhelming for that matter, and it had too much cabbage for my liking, but then again... that's personal preference, right? But would I order the salad again? Probably not...  Service was fairly prompt, though we had a bit of trouble understanding our waitress. Didn't have to wait considering we visited here around 1PM. I would say seating is fairly comfortable, and the restaurant is neatly decorated.   The only complaint I have about this place is paying with credit card, you'll ONLY have the option of paying 15%-20%, nothing less. At first I thought I had missed the option, but nope.. there is no \"other option\" for you to select.  So if you plan on paying anything less than 15% or more than 20%, be prepared to bring cash.   Definitely will be back for more of that kimchi fried rice, definitely my favourite.  But this time... I'm bringing cash."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out and guess what I find after eating half of the pork bone soup? A wasp. Craved some Korean food today and decided to give this place a try. This is the first time i've been here and the last time, unless i'm craving some bug again."}
{"text":"Beef Kimchi Fried rice with Kalbi Combo ($18.95) The Kalbi was really good! Well marinated, and the meat was nice and tender. Surprisingly there were a lot of pieces of Kalbi, at least 8 pieces. The kimchi fried rice topped with a fried egg was nothing special, I've had better - lacked a bit of flavor. They were generous in ingredients - lot of beef pieces and kimchi. The combo also came with a mini side dish of coleslaw and mashed potatoes. Portions here are large, well worth the money spent.  Kimchi Creamy cheese Rice Cake ($12.95) Baked cheese on top of kimchi and rice cake in Alfredo sauce. This was okay, nothing special.  Sounds better than it tasted. The sauce was a little starchy, I'm thinking they probably added corn starch to the sauce making it more thicker. This dish really lacked flavor - Kimchi added some flavor but there wasn't that much kimchi in it. There wasn't much cheese and it wasn't that gooey either. Definitely expensive for what you get, especially since its just rice cake."}
{"text":"Their food is still alright.  However, the locks on their washroom does not work.  There is a women's washroom and a unisex/disabled accessible washroom.   The lock doesn't work at all for the unisex."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever writing on yelp. I am very shocked with this restaurant. Cannot believe this restaurant still exist. Will never come back.  My wife and I visited this restaurant on nov 10 Friday   We ve placed ordered a Japanese donkatsu dish and a kimchi fried rice with tonkatsu combo. As soon as meals are delivered, we got shocked as it looked burnt as dark brown burnt. I asked the server(female korean) about tonkatsu s colour as it was really dark and dry. She has mentioned that it s normal to her. It was really dark and dry overcooked. I guess now that they don't change the oil often and don't really have skill to cook. I couldn't even finish my meal. That's how bad the meal was.  Service : understandable if they never been trained or don't care at all. They will never come checking on customers unless you grab server. Like wow.."}
{"text":"Why is the dukbokki so spicy?! Each piece was like a mini-fire in my mouth... wow. Of course my spice-tolerant bf was unfazed by it but I thought this was above-average spicy... you be the judge. Other than that, the portions were really big, especially the katsu which was gigantic. Good value for your money I guess. Overall, this seemed like a trendy spot for a quick bite, doesn't seem that authentic though."}
{"text":"Just steps away from North York Civic Centre station. I got the don katsu which was one of their top items in the menu and my company got the pork cutlet. The food came with miso soup on the side and Korean side dishes (which I was not really a big fan of). It came with a lot of food as this was my first time trying Korean/Japanese katsu. The sauce that came with it was good and I enjoyed the little scoop of potato they gave. It was extremely filling, the cutlet itself being very crispy and juicy. My company also agreed that the food was good, he couldn't even finish it properly and said that he would come back. Overall, it is something I would like to try once but would only come back if I'm really really craving this and am in the area!"}
{"text":"I saw my friends posting pictures from this restaurant, the meals looks so delicious and have a very large size. So I decided to go and give it a try.   It did not disappoint me. Meals all do have very large size. The materials are pretty good. They look exactly like the foods from my friends' photos. And The price is not expensive. But the taste was just ok, I'd say it worth the price."}
{"text":"Happen to be walking around that area to find a new restaurant. The interior decor is mostly wooden, with a twist. Very urban. One wall had trees against a brick wall which is pretty cool and nice.   Washroom is big and clean.   Happy:  It came with 2 small side dishes which I love the turnip and cucumber one. The dishes came out in good time. Presentation of the dishes looked great. All 3 of us were happy and satisfied with our meal.  Shrimp fried rice - they didn't cheap out on the shrimp.  Chicken curry katzu - he got 4 slices of chicken which he didn't expect and devoured them. He was too full afterwards.  Bulgogi udon noodle soup - it was hot just the way I like it. Not happy that there wasn't a lot of bulgogi meat. They lack in this aspect.   They didn't rush us and we were there for quiet a long time chit chatting.   Verdict:  due to atmosphere and price, YES I would go back and try their other dishes."}
{"text":"New Korean place in Yonge-Finch Korea town. I had the Curry Donkatsu, I enjoyed it. Not particularly special, but good nonetheless.   What makes this place unique to the other Korean restaurants in the area - of which there are many - is the environment and atmosphere. The wooden interior with clean lines presents a warm, modern-looking atmosphere that anyone can enjoy. This would be a wonderful place to take a date.   I would absolutely return; highly recommended."}
{"text":"So impressed. Got the hamburger steak dish loaded with goodies.. She got the cheese potato pancake.. Both excellent!"}
{"text":"Decent place to dine out. Ambience and food presentation is great. The food itself is alright - Nothing badly done or outstanding. I recommend Fish katsu/cutlet over the original tonkatsu."}
{"text":"Pretty good. This place opened up on the 18th I believe. We got the chance to try it today and it filled up pretty quickly. The decor is similiar to Kinton next door with the same black tiles, large open windows and the wooden benches and tables.  We were quickly seated but that's most likely because we were some of the first people to check out this new restaurant. It has a pretty good selection ranging from $11-22 on the main dishes I believe.  We ordered the kimchii omlette rice and the cream chicken katsu. And was immediately served a side dish of pickled vegetables and two varieties of soup, one for each dish. Miso for the omlette rice and cream of mushroom for the cream katsu. Both were pretty standard.   Once our dishes came we were astounded by the sizes! These dishes were very big, larger than an adult man's head! The Kimchii Omlette Rice was delicious, a little spicy and tart; served with a Demi glacé sauce, potatoe salad and Cole slaw. I wish that the Cole slaw and potatoe salad weren't so sour as it doesn't complement the dish very well. I believe a side garden salad and some wedges would have been a better option.  The Cream Chicken Katsu was by far superior. Four small katsu pieces came pre sliced and covered in a creamy Alfredo sauce that tasted creamy, salty, and cheesy. This dish came with a small salad, rice and the same potatoe salad and Cole slaw of the previous dish. The tartness worked better with this dish than the omlette rice.   Our bill came up to $32 including tip, $28 without. I would say the place is very much worth the price, I look forward to trying it again!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice   I think my main thing I want to say is that their lunch portions are way too big, but they match the price you are going to pay. I would rather they reduce the amount of food but also reduce their prices to something more reasonable for lunch.  Food wise they're not too bad."}
{"text":"Sorry to say that but I won't come back. Recently, I came once or twice a week. Their food is fine, not too special cuz this location has much more options in Korean food. Last week, I came and ordered beef bibimbap. They gave me a fried egg, which is cold and hard. I think they made it long time before.  The last time when I came, I was waited to be seat but no one paid attention on me. Then two ladies, who came after me were seated first while they have many available tables and didn't care about me."}
{"text":"Fantastic Japanese Korean fusion restaurant with great service, cozy ambiance, and best of all... delicious food in large servings!   I was very pleased with the katsudon. Very filling, nicely deep fried and topped generously with egg and sauce. I was also impressed by the large katsu box sets which my friends ordered.   Crazy Don has a wide variety in their menu from katsu, sushi, udon, and Korean soup. There should be something for everyone here.  Great place to catch up with friends and enjoy great food."}
{"text":"I've never had such a bad meal in this area and I've lived here for 2 years. My wife ordered the salad and it came out wet and devoid of any flavor. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap and it had so little beef I contemplated sending it back to the kitchen. We both took most our meal to go. We'll have better luck dressing them up ourselves.  Highly doubt I'll be back unless it's for katsu. However, Katsuya is in the area so why even bother?"}
{"text":"This place was so overwhelmingly disappointing I wonder how people are coming here tbh (probably first-time goers like me). Passed by here a couple times and always wanted to try it out so we finally did when a lineup for another restaurant close by was too long. Decor and everything was nice inside, but of course that did not compensate for the type of food/service we got. The cups for the COLD hot tea was dirty (no it wasn't COLD TEA) it felt like they were sitting out for a long time. The servers were always hiding in the back had no idea what they were doing. I tried the Japanese donkatsu and the batter was literally falling off the meat. The meat had the weirdest crumbly texture I could've literally used the side of the fork to cut it. Fries were not good as well, too much sauce in my opinion. I personally didn't get a chance to try the pork bone soup we ordered, but judging from the experience I had with what I ate, I wouldn't expect much from it."}
{"text":"Food was okay - nothing exceptional but it was good. However service definitely needs improvement.   There was only one waiter but all night there were no more than 4 table, us included. He never checked on how we're doing until we called him. When we asked to split some items we ordered between the 3 of us he said it couldn't be done."}
