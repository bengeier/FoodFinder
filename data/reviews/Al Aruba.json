{"text":"I really wish this place was easier to see, because the food is amazing. The staff is nice, and the food is fresh. You can tell it was made to order. It tastes like the type of meal you'd have at moms house. I recommend the somali food. If you've never had somali food, then this is the best place to first experience it. Hot and flavorful. The banana was kind of weird, but you're supposed to eat it with your food. I didn't want to at first, but I tried it and it was AMAZING! Definitely wish there was an Al Aruba near my place, because I'm seriously craving some right now."}
{"text":"Easy to miss this place while rolling down McDowell. This hole in the wall specializing in homey (and halal) Somali food appeared to be a 2-person operation on my visit, with the proprietor running the register, serving, and putting out food on the small steam table where he was keeping the day's featured dishes and a woman in the kitchen taking care of plating other food and dishwashing.  At first, you have to dig into the menu to find the Somali/Mediterranean options as most of the real estate is devoted to lunch specials and plates aimed at mainstream American tastes (burgers, cheese steak sandwiches, fried fish, wings, etc).   My $10 plate lunch of cubed/chopped mildly seasoned, roasted goat shoulder and tasty rice came with a little bit of green salad, a small portion of deliciously tangy pinto beans, a small cup of fine chopped jalapenos and onion (\"hot sauce\"), and a good sized bowl of rich vegetable (though, likely not vegetarian) soup. I washed it all down with an agua fresca-like mango drink without the teeth-aching sweetness so often found in the Mexican fruit waters.  As I was finishing up my meal, a small crowd of African (Somali?) cab drivers descended on the place--almost all of whom had a salmon, rice, and salad plate, which was served and eaten with a fresh banana. Some of the guys appeared to be regulars who felt very much at home there. Great testament to the owner's hospitality.  On my way out, I chatted a bit with the proprietor about the day's offerings, and he indicated that he has plans to add more items to the menu and vary the offerings from day to day. I hope this means that eventually the Somali/East African items will take center stage."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago while driving around i noticed a few people walking into this hole in the wall type of place, didnt think much of it at the time but every time i drove by after that my curiosity kept making me wanting to find what this place was all about. Last night was the night in which i hadnt even finished my plate of delicious grilled goat with rice, steamed cabagge and spinach with some black beans in which i was already planning my next meal here. To tell you the truth the service was a little slow, the original menu item i wanted wasnt available (the chief cook had the night off) and they offered me and my friend the grilled goat and the marinated chicken. By the end of my meal i was thankful i had the goat....it was beyond amazing! I must say that i am ready to try more Somalian dishes.....im sold on it! Next time im trying the kabobs with the yellow rice."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff. Salmon was wonderful, incredible rice and interesting salad dressing."}
{"text":"Ordered food for delivery, and a few minutes later I get a text from Eat24 saying they have been unresponsive for 10 minutes.  I call the restaurant myself and an automated voice tells me the \"person is unavailable\". Upon cancelling, I'm promised a refund within 5 days.  why charge me without putting in the order? 1 star for inconvenience and unprofessionalism on both parties."}
{"text":"I had one of the most interesting experiences at this restaurant. A Mexican lady attempted to cook my husband and I Mediterranean food. Our kabob plate was a flattened, grilled chicken breast. It was seasoned with chili powder and served with a green salsa (delicious, but not Mediterranean). She had to look at the photos on the menu in order to make the plates. She did not speak English. When she brought out the hummus (that appeared to be aged based on darkened color and thickness), she did not understand that pita was supposed to come with it. Finally, by using the Spanish word for bread, she brought us a plate with a thick piece of dense, stale bread. We tried the food, just for the heck of it, and the woman actually did a spectacular job on the chicken and salsa. But what we were served, was not Mediterranean. That lady could not possibly work there. She had zero clue how or what to cook. On top of our chicken 'kabob' plate and hummus, we also got a chicken pita gyro.... and because she looked at the photo, it was ACTUALLY ON A PITA! The pita however, was older than I could probably count on all of my fingers and toes, and harder than a rock. So, we passed on it. We finally got to the paying part of the visit and when I thought the experience couldn't get any weirder.. it did. The Mexican lady came around the counter and looked up at the photo menu with prices, counted, added, and gave us a price of $26 in Spanish. My husband gave her the correct price, $29 and then told her that we had a restaurant.com coupon for $15. He relayed it to her a second time in Spanish, and when she 'understood', she said that we could only pay her in cash. So we gave her the difference and a tip (because even though she obviously didn't actually work there or have any idea what she was doing in terms of Mediterranean, she cooked a phenomenal chicken and made authentic salsa). The lady didn't even ring in the order, so she obviously couldn't log in to the iPad. I have no idea what she was doing in this hole in the wall, run down business, but she didn't belong. The restaurant looked like it shouldn't be in business any longer. For all of the reasons that I am sure you could deduce from my novel of a review, I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place was really hard to locate! Once found, the door was locked, despite the open sign on the window (it was 3:00 on a Friday!). I peeked in and saw workers behind the line. I called the phone number and nobody answered!"}
