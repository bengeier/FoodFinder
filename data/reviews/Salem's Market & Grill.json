{"text":"Wow what a great place to eat. Not only do they have rolls but burgers and steak too! The steak is full of flavor and for around $10 it's a steal. Also, while you're waiting for your food, the market is a great place to shop."}
{"text":"after a friend of mine had a disappointing experience at istanbul (quality/quantity vs price), i decided he needed a trip to salem's.  two drinks, two dinners plus hummus for about $20 (with tip) and he was in heaven.  generous portions of amazing food.  the lamb curry is delicious, the falafel perfectly cooked and very tasty.  i've also had the goat and shawarma which were both excellent."}
{"text":"Food blew my mind so good! Prices were great and so was customer service. Got a meal it was huge portion have dinner for tonight, thanks! Service was great, very nice staff! Got and would recommend chicken shawarma and tikka masala! Both fantastic!"}
{"text":"I'm new to the area, and I read reviews for this place on Yelp. The place looks nice on the outside. Upon entering, I found this place dirty. The customer service was bad, and the food was so-so.  Their Hummus seemed old. Their Baklava was of poor quality.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very good food and very authentic! I felt like I was eating in Greece rather than in Pittsburgh. The hummus is delicious and I took some home to eat with a spoon. I would definitely recommend this place, it's quite an experience."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fresh and best tasting -- great cut of beef! Rest of the Arabic food is above average and for me that means much much better than most places!! Again, amazing burgers."}
{"text":"My first impression was this store is a mess... finding a halal butcher in Pittsburgh is a pain... seems like this is the only option I've had.. some product are expired (again, watch out the ED!!)  The people working here was not nice.. I don't understand why they are mean.. well, at least one of them, not all of them. the quality of the meats is okay, just a bit pricey compare to what I have back in Houston. I hope I have had better luck next time.. or.. I hope I will find another halal butcher..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch AND dinner in one day during a very short trip to Pittsburgh. I just had to write this review because no one has raved about their personal-pizza sized pide (i think they call it something else, but I call it pide). They make the bread there baked with several types of filing. I tried several--but i have to strongly recommend the spinach and feta! The spinach and feta pide was so delicious that I thought about it all afternoon after lunch, and knew it would only be right to go back here for dinner.  I wish I lived in pitt just so I can go here for lunch AND dinner. Still thinking about that pide.   They have plenty of other food that are also so delicious.  They know how to cook here. Chicken breast can easily go dry and and lamb sometimes tastes very lamb-y and chewy. But that was not the case here. The tandoori chicken had fire but not at all oily that the spices lingered in your mouth even after brushing your teeth. Actually I wanted to keep eating just so that flavor would remain in my mouth. The lamb kebab was kebabed to perfection.Go ASAP and get a platter, and several of the spinach&feta pide for later and the next day. The price is right and a platter portion is more than enough for two people."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get a gyro in town. My cousin, who went to Greek stop before, thought that this was better. I recommend getting the chili chicken, gyro platter, and the naan. Their fries are crispy and gyros are flavorful. Try the backlava when you're their too."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is great. Everything. The bacon cheeseburger(made with beef bacon) might be the best in town. The falafel and schwarma are awesome, as is everything from the hot bar; chili chicken and palak paneer are my favorites. The service is very polite and prompt, and some of the friendliest folks around. Next door is a fantastic market with a top notch halal butcher. Don't hesitate, go to Salems."}
{"text":"We had lunch at Salem's today.  The service was first class and the food was fresh and great tasting.    The staff is super friendly. The polite  young man who took my order was helpful -- he not only explained the history and ingredients of various desserts and side dishes -- he also suggested options. The service was both efficient and speedy.  My husband had the lamb/beef  shawarma; both the spice marinade and temperature were perfect. My falafel with yogurt sauce on the side was quite tasty!  While the ambiance might not impress the bourgeoisie, the food and friendly staff will. The food is fresh and the servings are large."}
{"text":"I used to buy a package of Egyptian cheese from Salem's because It tasted exactly like the one I had back home. Once, I bought the same package and took it to my friends' house. When we opened it, it was covered in MOLD. The way the package is made, you cannot see the cheese until you open it. Anyway, I didn't want to make a big deal about it, I kept it in the Package till I got a chance to go back to the store. I took it to the owner of the store who was very very rude. He accused me of making it MOLDY by leaving it out of the fridge.  I will never go back there ever again."}
{"text":"My family and I have frequented this restaurant for some years now. I write today because I'm always impressed with the consistency of their quality and great tasting food. This is hands down the BEST place in the city for middle eastern food! Their customer service is outstanding and welcoming. I enjoy the peaceful, friendly atmosphere with its casual vibe. If you're in the mood for tasty, food and a plethora of options this is the place for you. EVERYTHING I've ever had was scrumptious! I would highly recommend this place to the burger fans. There's a butcher on the opposite of the restaurant, in the market. So the meat is fresh & halal. Then you can have beef bacon if you like a bacon cheeseburger.  Also,the spicy chicken dish, tikka masala dish and lamb shank is tasty and plentiful. The portions are enough for two or leftovers.  The people working there are informative, kind and willing to answer any questions. This is just always a nice experience m: from the vibe of the place, to the food and the friendly service. I'll be back here for years to come."}
{"text":"The roasted turkey that I ordered from them for Thanksgiving didn't look or taste like roasted. Even if it wasn't roasted, it should have tasted good for the money I paid ($80+!). I have always had good experience with them with their meat and grilled food, but this turkey was a disaster, IMO. Still will buy other things from you guys, but no more turkey!"}
{"text":"Love this place; not fancy, but you get an enormous amount of delicious middle-Eastern/Indian food under 10 bucks. The staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the dishes. My favorite is the saag panneer and stewed chick peas. It's enough for 3 meals."}
{"text":"I was recently turned on to Salem's as I work on the other end of the Strip District and I really dig it - great fresh food (reasonable $$) and the staff is awesome. Their butcher shop is superb too - you can get really nice beef, goat and lamb there. They have the more interesting cuts - hangar, skirt, shank, and super fresh liver, kidney and heart (my fave!).  Great burger, kofta, shawarma and a killer goat curry.  Easy parking too - they are far enough off the main part of the strip away from the hoi polloi."}
{"text":"Low quality meat , I do not recommend this place  . I got sick after eating their meat"}
{"text":"I've gone here close to 100 times over 4 years. It's always fantastic and the quality has never diminished. These guys know their stuff!"}
{"text":"Awesome food -- affordable and oh-so delicious. My friend and I often make the trek from Murrysville to the strip just to indulge.   One thing you can count on is people of all walks of life dining here: the  Pakistani women in elegant shalwar kameez and matching hijab, the recent migrant from Jordan, dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and hanging out with his buddies, and the Pittsburgh-area foodies who have been turned on to this place."}
{"text":"Thank you to Yelp for helping me find this place while visiting for the weekend to watch a Phillies, Pirates Game back in April. Such a cool little place, I wish I could visit more often. Cafeteria style food on one side and an awesome market on the other side where you can watch them butcher your meat right in front of you. They have a fairly extensive collection of middle eastern food products.  The food was fabulous. My wife and I had shawarma's and they were up there with the best I've ever had, and soo filling. They were great for a day of sighseeing. I always kinda worry that the staff in this type of place can be kinda indifferent and/or just make you feel awkward but these guys were super friendly. Also, they had these Lebanese non alcoholic malted fruit beverages called \"Laziza\" which were amazing! Its basically like a soda but not as sweet. I can't find them anywhere here in the Philadelphia and am definitely gonna get a couple cases next time I'm in town.   Even if you're not looking to buy any goods from the market you should pop in and take a look... unless you're squeemish about seeing full animals with no skin. Lots of fun stuff over there. I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I enjoy eating at Salem's market & grill once in a while, though I find it a little creepy. If you enjoy eating at roadside stands in third world countries (I do, honestly!), you'll probably like Salem's. The food is wonderful, authentic, using genuine spices and halal meat, and there are many dishes you won't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh (Goat and chick pea curry, anyone?). On the negative side however, it looks like a former Salvation Army cafeteria, complete with plastic trays, and you'll be eating off foam plates with flimsy plastic forks. While you're there, you can enjoy people-watching; it is popular with immigrants and visitors from a number of far-away countries. Before you leave, be sure to stroll through their store next door. The butcher shop is scary for some people but this is real meat, not the machine-processed shrink wrapped water-logged stuff they sell in WalMart. Some people are bothered however by animal parts that look like.... animal parts. Bottom line, think of it as an anthropology field trip and you can't go wrong. Your taste buds will be rewarded and you can pat yourself on the back for being so open minded."}
{"text":"You get the value for your money, and more. The portion sizes are very generous, and you can make two meals out of one order. The food is not spicy as you would find in an Indian-Pakistani restaurant, but they can cook tandoori chicken for you.  The staff is very friendly, caring, and quick with fulfilling your order.   The only deductions is for lack of look, but if you are only interested in food, you will be in safe hands."}
{"text":"Love the Tandoori chicken, and the Chili chicken. Everything is fresh with wonderful flavor, and it's a bargain. Fresh made Nan, too."}
{"text":"I have to agree with all of what Natasha posted above. I've only been once and I'm certain to go again.  Space: Place is huge - cafeteria is exactly how I'd describe it. Easily fit a party of twenty+.  Food: Very tender meats. For the meals you can pick up to three different types of meats/vegetables. I tried the Lamb Goat Curry, Chicken in some sort of Butter Sauce, and mixed vegetables. For side you can either choose more rice or a small salad. (I would like to try other options next time, like Chicken Tandoori)  Reminds me of truck food from college only better and a good price."}
{"text":"I work a block away from Salem's, and I eat there twice a week.  Don't be fooled by the cheap, cafeteria style seating - everything at Salem's is incredible, whether you want a burger and fries, or more traditional Indian/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food.  They have a large menu (posted above the counter) to order from, as well as about 20 feet of hot food waiting to be dished up from the counter.  Vegetarians have options such as vegetable curry, spinach, chickpeas, and hummus, but if you're like me, you want some meat!  Go ahead and try a lamb gyro, beef gyro, or some chili chicken.  They also have a great beverage selection, if you're into specialty sodas, juices, milks, or Snapple.  Salem's isn't the classiest joint in the strip, but like I said, I'll take it multiple times a week!  The prices are great when you consider how large the serving sizes are, but healthy eaters can get smaller dishes as well."}
{"text":"Wow. Visited the strip today and picked up some take-out for a late dinner tonight.  I will say that this was the best take out food we've ever eaten.  This was the first time we have been to Salem's (It is pronounced Sah-leems', we asked the guy.)  As others have noted, it is large inside, casual, and cafeteria style.  Very basic but very clean and we will definitely eat there at some point in the future.  Selections today were all varieties of chicken and we ordered a half rotisserie chicken dinner (the chicken was gorgeous, how often can you say that about chicken???) that came with rice and veggies.  Also picked up a gyro and some spinach pies.  We shared everything, did not finish it all but tried hard because it was all absolutely delicious.    We loved it and will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The people working there are always so friendly no matter how busy they are. I've tried quite a few dishes and have never been let down.  My personal favorite dish is the lamb shawarma (sandwich, not salad). It's a huge portion of food and the cost is under $7.00. It is difficult to eat the entire thing in one setting, but when it does happen, it sends me right into a (wonderful) food coma.  Additionally, the market side is a nice little place. They have a pretty good selection of Indian/Middle Eastern spices. I've purchased meat from them a few times as well, all of which is very fresh and clean."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. The quality and quantity of the food is tops as is the service. Friendly, helpful people behind the counter. The prices are so low as to be almost unbelievable. Did I mention the food is outstanding?  I wanted to savor every bit. I will definitely go next time I am in Pittsuburgh."}
{"text":"The chicken/beef patties (Samosas) and pretty good, usually get some garlic sauce with it. I usually will grab some butter chicken, its not the type you would find in authentic Indian restaurants, but if your craving it, you cant go wrong for the price. Its nice of them to give pita bread for free, usually next to the register. I like the rotisserie chicken as well, like a touch of Boston market. From my experience everything's been fresh during morning hours and lunch time, towards evening time (or closing time) I would rather order something fresh off the grill like a cheese burger or sheesh kabab. I've still got many other dishes to try, but these are the ones that have worked for me."}
{"text":"It's billed as Mediterranean food but the real stand outs are the Indian dishes. Tikka masala and chili chicken will have you wanting to return within a couple of days. Fresh garlic nan. The cheeseburger is even excellent.  Beware, ask what comes on the sandwiches - They put mayo on the cheeseburger. They put ketchup and mayo on the cheesesteak. Greek salad is also very good. Everything there is fresh."}
{"text":"Great great Indian/ Middle Eastern food. Excellent meat quality. Good, quick service! And big portions!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Salem's is excellent.  I have always got my fix of authentic arab/mediteranian food from their original location in Oakland.  This location is MUCH,  MUCH better!   There is parking.   It is impecably clean.   The space is huge.   The food is more varied and tastes great!  The service is way above any cafetria syle restaurant!   It is definately a place that makes you feel like you belong.....no matter who you are!  If you like mediteranian, indian-style food....you have to try it here.   It tastes great, feels real, and is inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I love Salem's!  I've enjoyed many of the items from the buffet at their Grill and the Market has a wonderful selection of specialty ingredients that are difficult to find at other stores.  I especially love their butcher counter - quality meats cut to order, with very friendly service!  I recently posted a recipe on my blog featuring tacos made with delicious goat meat I purchased there:  http://cookingthestrip.com/2013/05/02/tacos-de-cabra/"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced and great food. There's really nothing to say about the ambience. It's school cafeteria kind. I usually take out the beef bacon burger(All halal) or the curries or grilled fish. The naan is amazing! So is the tandoori chicken and mutton curry.  The butcher section has marinated meat that's super helpful for a weekday meal. I go here once a week."}
{"text":"Visits: Once, for lunch at the grill. Won't comment on the market, because I made no purchases there.  Food: My friend and I shared three dishes - the lamb kebab, the beef kebab, and the shawarma. The beef was reasonably good, with a decent blend of spices and a soft texture with separable strands - almost more like it'd been roasted rather than grilled. That's where the good ends. The shawarma was made of spiced ground meat, which wasn't what I expected, though I don't consider that an issue. What was an issue was that it veritably exuded oil, and somehow managed to be dry despite that. The lamb managed to be even worse. The flavor could be summed up as turmeric, with a dash of turmeric. The heavy yellow color made it difficult to tell, but given the tough, sinewy (almost crunchy) texture, I'd say it was undercooked. I remember a fleeting thought that I'd get ill from it, and sure enough, within an hour, I was wishing I had Pepto in the car. One point off for two of three dishes being worse than mediocre, and an additional point off for inflicting food poisoning.  Atmosphere: Awkward. The interior is essentially a cafeteria - columns of tables set up side by side, with a service line next to the grill. However, rather than having the low (or sometimes high) chatter of a cafeteria, the patrons were all very quiet, even couples and families with kids. It led to a strangely oppressive hushed feeling despite the dozens of people inside. I understand that this is probably not within the restaurant's control, but it's not pleasant, especially when waiting for food. One point off.  Service: No issues with service. The guys working the grill and register were plenty friendly enough.  Price: Neither good nor bad. I would've probably expected a dollar or so less per entry due to the atmosphere, but it doesn't put them out of the expected range.  Given that it made me better acquainted with the bathroom, I think I'm being pretty generous."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here. The food is always fresh and full of flavor. Lamb Chops super affordable. The portions are huge and even when the line is long tour not waiting long. Best Goat Biryani I have had in a Long time. Coming here your guaranteed to have a over full belly at half the price."}
{"text":"You know when you've been away from home for a few months, and when you go back, your mom  force feeds you an absurd portion of your favorite dish? That's Salem's. An unassuming community center-like set up attached to a market with massive portions of Middle Eastern food at a reasonable price. As an Indian person who appreciates similar flavors, I was thoroughly impressed and plan to go back at some point.   Food: Think Pittsburgh portions. Multiply by 2. That's what you get for around $10. I went for the rice and goat curry. Not a big goat fan but that dish made me one. The meat was soft and peeled off the bone. Since they made it bone in, the flavors were excellent. I would highly recommend it. My friend had the palak paneer which was equally as good. Definitely not for the weight watchers crowd and I wouldn't say it's the best middle eastern food I've had, but for the price and portions, it was well worth it.  Service: Arguably the best part of the experience here. Everyone is a \"brother (or sister)\" there, or so that's how you're addressed by the staff. I kind of appreciated that- it made it feel more homely.   Ambiance: I was on the fence about how the place is dressed up. Much like other reviewers said, it's kind of like a cafeteria or community dining hall- uncomfortable and worn black cushioned chairs, rickety tables, scruffy tiled floors and no fancy decor. They could probably do a better job keeping the place clean but the feel of it definitely fit the atmosphere as a whole. It would almost be weird to see it suddenly turn into an upscale or modern place..."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both times was great. My coworkers also frequent the business on a regular basis.  The guys behind the counter are super friendly and helpful if you have questions.  The chicken tikka masala is excellent!"}
{"text":"I was amazed at the quality and portion sizes here. they have a fantastic selection of hot foods and friendly employees. The kebabs and falafel are top shelf. to top it all off, the prices are the best for the food you get. You have a new regular customer."}
{"text":"As the saying goes, \" Salem's is owned by Arabs, employs Bengalis, serves Indian Food and advertises itself as a Mediterranean restaurant. All jokes aside, this is a good place, with an excellent location and a very busy, diverse flow of customers. One thing I will point out is the serving size. I wish they used measuring cups or spoons for specific servings per meal. They lack the consistency of serving portions and it's varies by worker. One will give you two scoops of rice while another will give you 3. One will give you 4 big spoons of meat while another may only give you 2. There should be uniformity when it comes to serving portions. It sucks because the amount of food you get is wholly dependent on the mood or the carelessness of the worker who fills up your container. Also the menu items are getting old, wish they introduced different items. Plus, no one serves actual curry anywhere in this country because actual curry will make your taste buds tingle and \"Uranus\" will later pay for it but your brain will keep forcing you to eat it. Why? The magic is in the spice not the food itself."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since I started working in the strip.  Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.  First time I had a gyro and fries, the gyro was massive, and came with a load of fries.  Everyone I talk to loves their fries..  Today, I tried their BBQ chicken, with basmati rice and chick peas.  Awesome flavors all day, huge portions.  I can say I will be coming back a lot more, and I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their menu!!"}
{"text":"I literally can't find one thing to complain about this place. Fresh, hot food! The service was quick, smooth and friendly. Clean and cool environment. We had the chicken tiki masala, the lamb chops and the lamb kabobs. Everything was so tender and flavorful. There was also a supermarket attached to the restaurant where you can purchase anything from seasonings to snacks to raw produce. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes Halal food!"}
{"text":"Another find from a google/livingsocial type deal.  I never knew this place existed. Sadly we now live in Columbus otherwise this would be on at least a one to two week rotation.When you enter the market, the food court is off to the left.  There is a huge and confusing menu selection but with the help of another customer and the person behind the counter, we ordered three meals, two chicken and one lamb.  For sides we had the rice...I love that rice, long and thin.  I don't usually fight over the rice but I fought over THIS rice.  Two of the sides were spinach.  Love love love it. Hubby usually hates spinach but we had to fight over that as well.  The third side was mixed vegetables.  I know I am being repetitious but loved that as well.  Sadly I cannot tell you the names of the dishes...first time customer confusion.  One chicken dish had a kick, not too much .  The second chicken dish was some sort of orange chicken, which had a lesser kick.  The third dish consisted of small slices of lamb.  All three meals came to around $22 without our coupon.  Each meal was huge.  We took them back to Columbus and fed ourselves amply for three days.  All too often we give places five stars and standing ovations out of politeness when food is great but not GREAT!!!  This place is on a whole other level.  Not fancy but if you are into good eating at an affordable price come here.  It is located near the Strip and has a parking lot for customers"}
{"text":"I come here about 1-2 times a month for a generous portion of chicken and rice.  There are typically 3-4 different chicken dishes here.  That's usually what I stick with...,the chicken options.  They also have a beef or lamb option.  The order goes like this:  -go up to the counter and point at what you want -that's it!  The guys serving you at the counter will throw in whatever you want and mix and match to your liking.  The basic order is a main meat option, rice, and your choice of salad or vegetable.  The mixed veggie option is good!    I am not a fan of the desserts here.  They aren't sweet enough for me...  Friendly service, reasonable prices, get it to go.., otherwise you can sit and eat in the cafeteria style dining they have here.  Personally, I prefer eating at home in front of the TV.    Oh and the building was painted up last summer and it looks cool.  One more thing- they have a market here now too.  Haven't checked it out but will soon..."}
{"text":"It's not easy to give any place 5 stars  but this was easy. Great food, great service and a real feel of community. If you don't know what to order just ask. The portions are very generous with meats not just rice. One meal can feed 2 people but you won't want to share. A couple of must trys the Lamb Chops make sure you order at least three and the ground chicken burger you will get a second order to go..."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how much food I got for $9! At least 2 meals worth! So good too...chicken tikka masala and spinach paneer. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I discovered Salem's nearly 3 years ago, after buying a Groupon for the place. When I walked in, I was suprised by the \"cafeteria\" set-up, with a large open area to sit and eat, a very casual atmosphere indeed. The menu was listed on a large board, with so many options I was overwhelmed. Most of the items listed I had: A. Never Heard of Before or B. Never Tried.  I was intrigued by the menu and everything smelled delicious, so I listened to the patrons infront of me in line, and went ahead with what they ordered-- the chicken schwarma. I had never tried Indian food before, but to me, it looked like a gyro and I was willing to try that-- the 2 ppl ahead of me liked it, so maybe I would to. At the end of the long counter of food options, was a section of dessert, so I took a piece of baklava and paid for my meal, which was just under $10. That's a pretty good deal I'd say, considering the large portions you get at Salem's. The schwarma had a mouth-watering smell-- definitely made with curry and other Indian spices and fresh, warm bread, I couldn't wait to dig in. I was suprised by the taste, it was so different from anything I'd ever had before, but I loved it! It was so good I tried to finish the whole thing, but there was no way, because it is a big portion of food, more than I could eat in one sitting. I was so satified with my meal, that I vowed to make it a regular spot for lunch if I was in the area.  Over the last few years, I've been back many times and have tried other things, but I always seem to go back to my first love, the shwarma.   **Also, the employees are so friendly, you feel very welcome there!   I'm so glad that they offered a Groupon for this place, because I would've probably never tried it & just grabbed lunch at Peppi's or something \"safe/norm\", not knowing about it, but in my opinion, the food here is better!! Try it, you will be having sweet dreams of schwarma."}
{"text":"Good.  Items are good and tasty. Especially chilli chicken is tasty, staff are friendly. I ordered white rice with Chilli Chicken, lamb curry , chick pea curry for $9.62 . Lamb curry pieces are smooth but taste is just ok, chick pea curry is good and chilli chicken is awesome. Rice is basmati rice. I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Lots of variety.  Very nice employees?.  Very good customer service.  Highly recommended?.. One star less because I've had better somewhere else. but this is one of the bests in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Very rude employees. Walked in to get grill and without acknowledging me he turns off the lights for grill food fridge and walks away. I asked if closed and he yells yes.  It was dirty anyways. Don't suggest"}
{"text":"This is our favorite for Indian food.  Prices are good.  It crazy busy for lunch. Portions are large. Service is fast. Customer service is lacking. Sure would be nice to be greeted properly."}
{"text":"Great food specially the biryani by special order! The biryani on the weekends is not that nice but by special order on weekdays is really good! Other food like kabas are also very tasty. Prefer going on weekdays less rush and better environment. Just loved it"}
{"text":"If your tired of Pennsylvania staples of food. Like pizza, steak salad, hot dogs, burgers , fries and pop. Then you better get your Ass here!!! The steak and cheese on nan!!! All I can say is wow unbelievable!!! Please don't order the fries because your not going to finish the steak and cheese!!! But I ordered them anyway!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!  We found this on Urban Spoon and we have never been disappointed. They have delicious chicken shawarma's. Their Naan bread is out of this world. One of my favorite things to get is their Chili Chicken. I also love their Lentil Soup and creamed spinach."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. The restaurant busy and the food is always fresh.. Today I got chicken curry, falafel sandwich and chicken samosas ... The samosas were okay  that's why I gave them 4 stars. But the curry and sandwich was amazing! I am going there again for sure ."}
{"text":"the food here is AMAZING! the portions are incredible. I paid around $10 for a huge platter that could probably last a few days if I wanted to. there's a nice market next door with a huge selection as well! the food options are numerous, but what I ordered was the chili chicken, chicken tikka masala, naan, spinach paneer, and rice. the chili chicken was by far my favorite and definitely recommend getting that. the naan was HUGE, fluffy, and perfectly buttery. there are mediterranean and south asian options.  on top of having perfect food, the staff is so friendly. it's a super fast paced food joint and they're really nice when you're ordering, which is ideal. this will definitely be my regular spot whenever I am in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Salem's yet?  This place is great.    Falafel sandwiches are always good.  (Ask for hot sauce on it.  You won't be disappointed.)  All of the gyros and shawarma are very good except the chicken - tends to have too many chewy bits (i.e., gristle).    I've had their shish kebab once, and it was mouthwateringly delicious, and their appetizers are outstanding: baba ganoush, hummous, tabbouleh.  You can easily make a great picnic with a few of these.  (I've done it before.)  The desserts are good, but nothing really special, for a Middle Eastern deli.  (Always a good selection, though.)  Service is always friendly, but a little spotty on procedure.  Sometimes I feel like I'm being asked impatiently for my order when I'm obviously still deciding, and sometimes I feel like I stand there for a couple of minutes before someone helps me.  I feel guilty for being critical, though, because they are very friendly.  Decor leaves a lot to be desired: just an enormous linoleum an drop-ceiling cavern with a few Steelers pictures on the wall.  (Bonus points for the garish, though colorful and friendly, murals on all of the exterior walls, though.)  Parking's a bonus, too: they have a small private lot that relieves the on-street parking, so they're one of the rare Strip denizens that doesn't require a parking space hunt."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place!!!! I come here, more than maybe any other restaurant in the city. I'm lucky in that this Gem is close to my work most days. They have a kinda cafeteria style thing going on here, you can order from the grill, one of the better burgers in the city for the price, 6$ or so, shish kebabs, and on and on, I've found the nan Philly cheesesteak to be maybe my favorite sandwich there, but beware! They normally put ketchup on both the burgers and cheesesteaks by default, so if you detest the stuff like I do, order it on the side, then you can make a big public display of throwing it out and go on and on about it, if I'm there, man I'll be cracking up. Hahah, anyway, aside from the grill, they have a big selection of prepared meats and usually 4 vegetarian dishes, the meats, which includes rice, are usually goat, ca few types of chicken, lamb, etc. all are completely delicious and total comfort food. A large dinner is enough for two, especially if you pick up the complementary pita bread at the register . Yeah!  The staff are all super nice, the place is always really clean, and the price is right!   I will say that the lunch hour does get packed, but the line does move pretty quickly. 6 stars!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Salem's.  The atmosphere is a little cafeteria-esque with its plastic 6 ft tables, but as soon as you start eating, you won't care. Everything is delicious.  Also - they catered our wedding and the food was awesome.  We put hummus on every table and thankfully there was some leftover that I got to take home.  Did you know that hummus freezes really well? The more you know.    Highly recommend their Chicken tikka masala.  And pretty much everything else. Yep. Just go there and eat as much as you can."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Salem's for a few years now and can't praise this place enough. The meats are well-seasoned and tender. The veggie options are really tasty too! The staff is attentive and super friendly and no matter how busy they are, service is always quick. Love this place so much!"}
{"text":"Fresh food yum. I stopped by during Ramadan for the late night buffet! It's over at 10z for 16.99. It's a really great way to try everything they have to offer. I wish they had a few more options for veggies but other than that great food"}
{"text":"Okay holy crap, this place gives you HUGE portions. I didn't even eat half of my food and I'm full. This place is Mediterranean and Indian inspired and it's really good! I ordered tandoori chicken which had basmati rice and a side salad. It was tasty and a nice amount of spicy. The potion was incredible! I also got a side of grape leaves which were cold and I love them that way. They were basic but good. The baba ganouj was good but I've had better. I like mine a bit less bitter. And the veggie samosa was DELISH. I would definitely get more of those. All and all, I'll order from here again and try something new because I feel it would all be good!"}
{"text":"I don't even live in Pittsburgh but anytime we are on a road-trip and Pittsburgh is along Route... we take a two hour detour just for Salem's Grill! The chicken burger is best I've ever had. The meat curry and and their spinach is another must try! We wish they had market like this in every state!"}
{"text":"I've never ordered something that I didn't love! The French fries are the best I've ever had!! Everything is so cheap and you get a TON of food! The staff is so friendly"}
{"text":"Salem's caters to Pittsburgh's Muslim community and its halal restaurant runs the gamut of food from the Islamic world, from Pakistan to Libya. But folks of all nationalities and religions come here for their tasty, filling lunches. Being more partial to Pakistani food myself, I usually get their curry-and-rice special; you can pick up to three different kinds of meat preparations with either plain basmati rice or biryani, and the vegetable of the day.   You HAVE to try the goat curry; it's rich and soulful with tender meat. I also love the creamy chicken tikka masala and the neon red chicken tandoori. It's huge and you won't need dinner after! The market is great for your Middle Eastern and South Asian specialties, as well as your various halal meats; I grew up eating kosher meat and I think halal/kosher meat tastes cleaner than regular meat. Also a really cool selection of sweets that remind me of my childhood with my nominally Sephardic grandparents. A fun gem in the Strip!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place.. I'd have not survived years of lunch in Pittsburgh without Salems.. A must try for those who like Indian, Pakistani, Afghani, Persian or any other middle eastern food.. Everything is displayed behind a glass counter and you can choose 2/3 entrees with rice or naan.. And they wouldn't hold back on quantity in a Togo box..  Plus, they sell goat meat at their butcher section.. A must visit for strip district visitors.."}
{"text":"My my my I cannot find enough words to describe this place maybe because I'm stuffing my face at this moment but let me pause for just a moment.   I experienced a flavor explosion - I mean from the first bite I was hooked.   Food crack is what this is I'm addicted not only is the food good the environment is authentic but welcoming.   You don't have to be any particular race culture or anything to enjoy this food there is something for every one.   Prices are fair service is great it's a place I wished I lived closer too there is a grocery store connected and there's even an event hall Salem's deserves 6 stars.   Love love love this place."}
{"text":"Don't go here for the ambiance. Go for the delicious, cheap and plentiful food options. I would recommend the chicken shawarma w/ the french fries!! I think they double fry their fries...they are amazing, and I am usually not a french fry person. I also got the chicken tikka masala meal which was just okay. They use huge chunks of white meat and the sauce is poured over the rice, so it was on the dry side. Very large portion for around $8. The grape leaves were meh, probably some of the least favorite I have tried. Their galub jamun was super overdone."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Just realized it existed and will be coming here on the regular. For those who may not know, there's a cafeteria here where you can sit down and chow down on some delectable Indian and Mediterranean cuisine!"}
{"text":"A hole in wall place for Indian and Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh. I walked into this place when exploring the strip district.  I got the chicken Tikka masala meal with the rice pudding as desert.  - big portion size - loved the butter Nan - Chicken was a bit hard  - loved the rice pudding.    If you are in Pittsburgh strip district give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Generous portions and very inexpensive prices.  A somewhat confusing array of Middle Eastern and Indian foods, but all very tasty.  The market has some unusual items that you can't find anywhere else."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but plan on going back. My dish was only so-so, but my buddies was awesome. So 3 stars for now. Will update."}
{"text":"I've been eating salems for over 5 years and I've never had a bad meal. The staff is very friendly, the portions are more than you can finish and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"Salem's is a great place for lunch or dinner.  It is a cavernous space, easy to get to in the strip.  Small off-street parking lot for those who drive.  It's set up cafeteria style, with all of the selections on giant chalk boards hung from the ceiling.  It can be a little overwhelming at first, but the guys behind the counter are super friendly and helpful if you need any assistance or have questions.  I usually go with my friend Nutbar, who is a hard-core carnivore, and he always gets a lamb dish, usually a gyro or shish kabobs.  I get the falafel sandwich or the vegetarian curry.  The portions are huge, the ingredients are fresh, and everything is perfectly seasoned and cooked.  They always have a good selection of desserts, the baklava is good.  The hummus and naan is delicious.  The tabouleh is good, has a bit more parsley in it than I'm used to, but very fresh tasting.  It can sometimes be a little chaotic at the cash register, where people pick up to-go orders as well as people like me who are eating on site.  But it's always a minor inconvenience.  Everything is served in styrofoam containers, helpful because often I can't eat everything.  As other reviewers have mentioned, this is strictly a no-frills place in terms of decorating.  Dropped ceilings, rows of simple tables and padded restaurant chairs, and a few Steelers memorabilia on the walls.  But you don't come for the ambiance--you come for the food!  This is the middle eastern counterpart of Spice Island, which also has great food in a kind of basic ambiance environment.  The prices, like Spice Island, are very reasonable.  Be sure to stroll through the market after your meal--they have a great selection of middle eastern groceries and ready-to-eat food."}
{"text":"Great food  Must visit place for folks new to Pittsburgh Beef kabob. 4.5 / 5 - melts in your mouth Chicken kabab 4/5 - great flavor Kofta kabab 3.8/5 - good and spicy Lamb kabob 2.5/5. - too chewy and fatty Naan - 4.5/5 - delectable Ambience - 2/5 Service - 4/5  Tip: just order the nan, don't get rice"}
{"text":"I always have the chicken curry and can't stop eating until I have finished everything. Always walk out of there feeling way too full. Today I decided to keep it light and have a lentil soup and tabbouleh. It was delicious and I am full again! How did that happen?"}
{"text":"Salem's is interesting.  It is a grocery store and cafeteria.  Styrofoam and plasticware.  The food is very good and the portions are huge.  If you are a big eater, you are going to be stuffed.  If you are a smaller eater, you will be taking half your meal with you.  Their tandoori chicken is amazing.  Their gyros are also good."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here at least once a week, I am never disappointed with the food quality, the portions or the price. One of my favorite places to eat. Staff is always polite and friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The chili chicken is out of this world - add some garlic sauce to it and it's the best meal in the city. My husband thinks the biryani is the best he's had in Pittsburgh since India. He had the lamb biryani and there are bones in it just FYI. But for real, garlic sauce and chili chicken. It's amazing."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Salem's, esp. with the opening of this new space. The restaurant, as someone else said, looks like a cafeteria but it's bright, clean and simple. The staff are courteous and service is fast.  The food is great. Pretty decent spread of offerings from shish kabobs to tandoori's to schwarma (gyro). Naans, lassi's, mango drinks, pop also on offer. I prefer to stick with the schwarma myself and it always delivers.  As for the market side, this is one of the best butchers in Pittsburgh - lamb, beef, steaks, chicken, goat at reasonable prices. I'm not strict about halal/kosher but I buy from here because I know the quality is good."}
{"text":"I always go there since it is down the street from my job but they were off today. First they gave me the wrong meat in my sandwich which I did not notice until I got back to my desk. I went back to get the correct sandwich which they were great about correcting but it was cold.  my office is literally 2 mins from the store so I cannot understand how my food was cold when it's made to order. Other than today I enjoy their food but I will not be back for a long while. It left a bad taste in my mouth"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing in so many ways! The food is incredible - we got the buffet tonight and loved the baklava, hummus, chicken tikka masala, chana masala, and grape leaves. And the staff were so kind and friendly. This is actually my first Yelp review ever - I just had to share how awesome this place is. I'll be coming back next time I'm in Pittsburg!"}
{"text":"We live in the Strip District and Salem's is one of our regular stops.  This is as good as Mediterranean/Indian food gets!  Let's cut the intro and get right into the good stuff:  Pros: The food, the food, the food! Seating area is ample if you'd prefer to dine in Take out is always packed well and convenient Interior is clean They have their own parking lot (In the Strip, it's a huge plus!) Dear God the desserts! Staff is friendly and helpful Prices can not be beat The value for the price is terrific, lots of food Did I mention the food??  It's delicious!  Cons: Not a one! This place rocks!  In summary, if you've missed out on this little gem at the end of the Strip District, you must visit!  Seriously, go now!"}
{"text":"You've got to get yourself down to Salem's. This place is hands down my favorite in the city for Indian/Middle Eastern food. The ambiance is cafeteria, as other reviewers have noted. However, the food more than makes up for the unassuming digs. If you are lucky enough to come down on the right day, you can get their saag paneer, which is creamy, tasty and full of paneer cheese. If not, do yourself a favor and order the shwarma (my husband's fave) or the chicken tikka.   An interesting side note about this place- we originally heard about Salem's when we were discussing urban chicken rearing with a friend. This is one of the few places in the city limits that will process your chickens for you for a very reasonable price. What this means for you, the restaurant-goer, is that your meat is guaranteed VERY FRESH. Like, processed on the premises fresh.  Also, if you have extra time, check out their market. They have an excellent selection of meats, as well as a great array of middle eastern spices, fruits, candies, and so on. Check out their Ramadaan break-fast meals in the evening around August-October - it's basically an all-you-can-eat meat buffet for under 20$/person.  I've taken pretty much all of my extended family here at one point or another, and everyone has loved it! You have to be a bit adventurous, and don't come here dressed to the nines on your way down to a play or evening downtown - you'll definitely get some weird looks."}
{"text":"The food was good they give you large portions so it is worth the money.  Prices are reasonable.  The employees serving food and at the cash register were very nice and polite.  I got the chicken chili and curry chicken with rice.  Plenty of parking in strip."}
{"text":"They once held witch trials here, but they have hypocritically changed their tune to that peace-and-love tree hugging stuff now. How picky and choosy of them.  I have been wanting to check out Salem's for a very long time. For one reason or another, it took me until this past summer to have the chance to do so. I'd give it 5 stars for their wonderful peaceful murals and four stars for their good prices. However the food itself is pretty average and tasted somewhere in the region of three star quality. So it averages out to Cuatro, but I probably won't make a habit of coming back here too often. I'll need one more trip, though, to try out some of the dishes I missed, in case I missed a gem.   So, much like my gf, it's huge inside and they have lots of Middle Eastern food options, so give it a try if you love this type of Cuisine and maybe you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great foods, i love biryrani and spicy chicken ! The owner(?) big young guy is so friendly."}
{"text":"Wow! This is one of my new favorite places and probably in my top 5 places to eat in Pittsburgh now. That naan seriously! Get the naan. They have super generous portions. I think enough to share a whole meal with someone. Everything I've had here is excellent! It is also nice that it is a little off the hustle and bustle of the strip and even have their own parking lot."}
{"text":"Everything is fantastic here!! My mouth waters when I come in here...everything looks and tastes amazing! They give you huge portions, so come when you're hungry. The restaurant is cafeteria style- you stand in line to order, then you pick from a wide variety of dishes what you want to eat. It's crowded around 1:00-3:00, so come as early as you can. They also have a market next door so you can shop while waiting for your food. I recommend trying the chicken schwarma or get a little bit of everything. The saag paneer is one of my favorite veggie dishes they serve. The chicken biryani and lamb curry are good, too. Besides the food, the staff is great too. When you're shopping in the Strip and need a quick lunch, stop at Salem's! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I finally got sick from this place.  There is a MAJOR cleanliness issue.  Picture dirty trays used by other customers piled two feet (yes) high on top of a trash can overflowing with garbage, immediately next to the utensils and napkins you're supposed to use.    I've never seen a single table wiped down between customers.  There are flies flying through the dining room.  There is the overwhelming scent of raw meat that wafts in from the equally disgusting grocery store.    The refrigerator coolers they keep raw chicken kabobs and such in are WARM to the touch.   If this is what we see front of house, I dont want to know what goes on in the back.  I was extremely ill within an hour after eating here.  The food is good but I did not enjoy it the second time.  I just can't ever bring myself to come back here.  Also the high chair is covered in filth.  I can't imagine anyone seating their child in it."}
{"text":"I had to give this place an update. I knocked off a star because they used to be inconsistent in their offerings but they have remedied that issue. My husband and I go here at least once a week and it is amazing. The service is awesome too! They remember us and always make us feel appreciated.   Note that the hours on here are wrong. They are open through dinner every night."}
{"text":"This review is for the Market section only.  I've always wondered where I could buy a bone marrow - Well look no further. This is the place to go. Looking to buy a Goat Meat? Lamb Meat? or even simply a chicken - Yep! This is the place to go.   The prices are very reasonable compared to other Grocery chain Stores. Even though the prices are not fixed and could change depending on the availability - it still beats other stores by couple dollars/lb.  Besides, you can also find all sort of spices and masalas including various South Asian food products."}
{"text":"I came here with my friends during lunch. The place is set up as a cafeteria which we didn't mind since there were plenty of seats. There was a variety of food which we could pick from. I got the lamb curry which was delicious!! The portions are huge and so worth the price that you pay for. I would definitely go back! Even though the place doesn't look too nice, the food has been delicious!  Everyone liked what they ordered."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I can't believe that I somehow went to the market and missed the entire restaurant and HUGE dining area just next door.   The market has everything you need--- produce, frozen foods, canned and dry goods, and a great selection of fresh meats. I got the marinated lamb and chicken skewers that we grilled up and they were absolutely delicious.   Just next door, there is a huge cafeteria-style restaurant that I can't wait to try again. Fast service with a very friendly staff. A huge group of us went so I was able to try a little bit of everything and it was all delicious. Gyros, kebabs, wraps, curry dishes and more. Great hummus and baklava! The food is high quality, generous portions and at a great price!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise...off the beaten and crowded path of the Strip District but close enough to walk to from there,  this is an oasis of deliciousness. We sampled much of the menu, Chicken Masala, grape leaves, shawarma, lentil soup, etc etc. Each more fresh and delectable than the next. Get out of the long lines and crowds and walk down to Salem."}
{"text":"I just ran across this place a few weeks ago and can't explain how pleased I am with my new find. As a fan or gyros, I can be picky about the ones I like; these ones are wonderful. For the type of job that I do, I travel all around Pittsburgh and I live finding places like this. This restaurant is a deli style, go up to the counter and wait at a table for your food type or restaurant. Though I only have tried the gyro combo (twice), I saw people ordering all kinds of other middle-eastern style foods, all of which look incredible. Two thumbs up, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Located at the far end of the strip district. They have a small parking lot next to the market. If you're going for lunch I would suggest going before noon or else there is a huge line. The portions are big enough for 2-3 meals and the staff is super friendly. But most importantly, the food tastes good! I ordered rice, chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, naan, a veggie samosa and a bottle of water and it came out to $14. The samosa was the best that I ever had and I went home with enough left overs to last me at least a second meal."}
{"text":"Shwarma's are unbelievable and the staff is awesome. They're generous about letting you try their food and are very friendly. Great value for awesome food.  I've been there 4-5 times and the food has been consistently great. Meat is always good quality and tender while other ingredients seem fresh."}
{"text":"I somehow neglected to review Salem's, despite visiting back in Oct. for lunch.  I stopped by at around 11:30 on a Sat., and initially wandered into the Middle Eastern grocery portion.  If you're a newbie like me, note that the portion of the building closest to Penn Ave. is the grocery section--the door to the cafe is off the parking lot on the left side of the building, but can also be accessed through the grocery portion as well.  For my lunch, I decided to order a falafel sandwich with a side of fries ($7 and change, if I recall correctly).  The order took about 10 min. to be served, and the portions were decently sized.  The sandwich was tasty enough, but not necessarily the best I've had in PGH (apologies--details escape me given the amount of time that's passed).  The fries were of the lightly battered variety, but weren't fresh cut.  I also ordered a Middle Eastern soda of some kind ($2), which was a unique and refreshing way to wash it all down.  Overall, I was pleased with my experience at Salem's.  At the time of my visit, it was pretty quiet and clean, given that it wasn't long after opening.  Aside from a local cop, I was the only white customer, which is a positive sign of the authenticity of the cuisine.  During my visit, I noticed a sign stating that they offer an all-you-can-eat Indian buffet during Ramadan.  If you enjoy large portions of Middle Eastern or Indian cuisine on the cheap, I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their prepared food counter is the perfect Middle Easter food fix in Pittsburgh. Everything is amazing and you can tell by the steady flow of local Middle Eastern traffic that they are making phenomenal food. Their lamb shank is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Have I just been completely unobservant, or do they purposely make their buffet an inside secret that only regulars know about? We came here near closing time on a Friday night, wondering if we could get anything before they closed. We casually asked about lamb shank, and the guy told us that we can get it when the buffet starts. Now the heating counters at the back made sense! So I guess they do this buffet on Friday nights after the regular closing time--whether this was a special event or one that is more regular on other days, I have no idea. I don't recall seeing any other signs or reading other Yelp reviews about this.  So we stayed and waited about half an hour (they didn't officially get started until past 8:20), and people kept pouring in over the next hour until the place completely filled up. At $15 a person (they price by the pound if you take out), it really was a good bargain. Most of their items are the same as on the regular menu, but what really stuck out was the lamb shank that we originally wanted. Huge bones with a lot of flavorful attached meat. What more can you want?   Some of the chicken items were pretty dry, so I'll probably avoid that for future visits. They also bring out some soups, desserts, and a salad and fruit bar. So this was a pretty standard (but awesome) buffet."}
{"text":"Salem's is my all time favorite halal  place in Pittsburgh. I have been coming here since I was seven and ever since they expanded and opened the grill, they have always provided me with quality food. An absolute must is the halal bacon cheeseburger and the chicken shawarma with the chipotle mayo sauce. The hot food bar is also good if the grill is closed and they have really great spinach and chicken options."}
{"text":"best meats and shawarmas in town. if you can get past the language barrier you will be fine. call your order in ahead if its a big one. tehse are free range beef/chickens. organic. halal meat. forzen foods and cafeteria also."}
{"text":"I have not been back. But, others have told me how wonderful the owners are.  So, I feel like I need to give them another chance.  When I check out, they are always very kind.   I feel that I should not be passive aggressive which is easy and my nature, but deal with the problem directly and speak with the owners; not aggressively but to solve problem or better understand it.   I know that my experience is due to cultural difference. But, could you just delay me ten minutes due to biases and not  forty-five. That would be the difference between \"I'm ok. I get it. \". And being furious.   Ill let you know if I am adult enough to speak with the owners and the outcome."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious food in Pittsburgh. So good, we even had them cater for our wedding. Favorites include: Chili Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Falafel, and oddly, their fries! So good!"}
{"text":"Cheap food, excellent service. Not being from a city, most Middle Eastern food joints I've been to caters to the bland American palate. Note this place. I can't wait to go back to Pitt and eat here again."}
{"text":"I love Salem's. The food is excellent and the employees are fantastic. Their service is quick and I am always satisfied with my experience."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite spots in the city. My favorite is the lamb gyro. The price is great and the amount of meat they give you is fantastic. The pita is fresh and it is packed with goodness.   I also really love rice. They have some really great rice that is always cooked to perfection. They will even let you out some sauce from a dish on top at no extra cost. They offer free pita and fried pita with your order.   I came during Ramadan for the buffet and was also fantastic. The customer service is what customer service should be. I'm happy that I found this place. It always makes me happy to see different people from different walks of life coming together to break bread."}
{"text":"It is really, really hard to find good lamb in the city.  Salem's takes care of that for you.  They do a great job with everything you could want.  Leg, boneless, I even saw a guy walking out with a lamb head, they will do it all for you.  The lamb is the best tasting and they will trim it down so it has no fat on it.  I loved it!    I went back the next time to try their lunch counter/dinner options of prepared meals.   Fantastic.  Their chicken gyro is not a \"gyro\" but a marinated piece of chicken.  I loved the marinate they put on it.  I had goat curry (which I have never tried) and loved it.    I plan on going back here to get all my meats in the future. I also heard a rumor they have grass fed beef if you ask for it."}
{"text":"The food tastes great. The portions are more than ample. The staff is friendly. What a nice surprise for basically an impulse visit. Our friends at the Pittsburgh Winery made the recommendation. We are glad we listened."}
{"text":"First of all.... The Pita land pita bread you get from salems is the best pita bread you could get in western pa... So I quickly ran here before a yelp event (non meal event) to grab some pita a get a quick bite. So after getting the bread I went next door and ended up getting the burger... It was absolutely delicious! Nothing fancy sesame bun with lettuce tomato onion and a well marinated and thick slab of ground beef  cooked to perfection with mayo and ketchup... Man it was tasty."}
{"text":"Massive portions of incredible food for an extremely reasonable price. Get wit it or get lost.  5/5 clams - TV"}
{"text":"They close at 8:00 PM.  I was in line at 7:35 PM to order one lamb kabob.  The customer ahead of me took 10 minutes to figure out what he and his friend wanted.  By the time I was able to order it was 7:47 PM and when I tried to place my lamb kabob order I was told that the grill is closed.  I tried to explain to him that I was in line for a long time and he was like, \"no the grill is closed\".  Ironically or rather to add insult to injury, the \"Mr. disregard to all customers in line\" (customer who took forever to order) must have ordered about 10 grill items because as I was being told that I couldn't get any grilled items, they were placing about 10 kabob items on the grill!    They should specify that the grill closes earlier and not only that be more considerate of customer waiting in line.  It's not great customer service when your telling me that the grill is closed but you're about to put a million skewers of raw meat on the grill.  Not planning to go back."}
{"text":"My favorite part of the almost daily trip to the Strip District, Salem's has great tasting food, fast, and inexpensive.  Lamb shank and chops, kebabs, kufta, biryani, samosas, shawarma, and plenty of vegan dishes too.  A must try next time you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been quite satisfied both times I've been here. I'm a creature of habit and tend to order the same thing all the time. I love trying different things here, so many flavors, so filling and reasonable price. I look forward to trying something new next time"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food at an affordable price.  Salem's is a no frills cafeteria style restaurant.  it has authentic cuisine from all over the Mediterranean. Helpful staff and did mention how good the food was?  Great for taking the family out."}
{"text":"Everything is good here. Its usually moderately busy. The lamb chops are the best. I'm not happy that the grape leaves are from a can but oh well. The little grocery store is nice too!"}
{"text":"A-mazing chicken schwarma. The best. Their naan is also very good. Loved the cafeteria setting and enjoyed walking through the market.  Only bad part: the parking lot beside the building is tight. Someone parked us in. Next time, I would look for street parking.  Next time I go to Salem's I will be sampling the yummy looking middle eastern desserts."}
{"text":"Ended up going back after another baby class and I got the gyro and garlic naan, as promised. It was very good."}
{"text":"A must for anyone who loves food.Favorite place in the city to eat.  Chicken and rice and everything nice. The spinach is next level. And i can almost guarantee you never had a hamburger this good before, then theres a chicken burger as well which is my favorite.    dont get me started on the Ramadan buffet if your not even Muslim its worth fasting to go to.   Their use of spices is top notch.  And the turkish delights are phenomenal like truly phenomenal. They also have a market next door with fresh meats and all that.   This place is the secret gem of the city."}
{"text":"Im giving this place a 5 on its loyalty to and quality of Arabic food, fantastic.  I just moved back from the UAE and this place has all the things I miss at a low price and with a great taste. The dining area looks like a cafeteria from high school...thats the biggest negative...but for lunch this is perfect for middle eastern food"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. It helps to know your middle eastern foods before you arrive as there's not much in the way of descriptions, but they do a great job. Grill and prepared stuff is all excellent, but the chicken shawarma platter with chick peas is where it's at"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem and unique experience! I've driven by this building so many times and never thought twice about it, however after it was continually recommended to me I decided to venture in. The inside is nothing fancy, no frills, or much warmth. Set up cafeteria style. But the food is so good and it's an amazing deal! I've been twice so far and had the chicken tikka masala over rice, and it was the best. I also got the warm naan bread to go with it and the spinach as a side. All three exceeded my expectations. The second time I also got a piece of the baklava, and I will say I've had better baklava. But maybe they were just having a bad baklava day because someone brought me a piece in the past from there and it was A+. So I'll be giving the dessert another chance next time! I split my meal both times with someone else and we still could not finish it because they give you so much. The people working there are also so nice. They are willing to answer any questions and let you sample the different items on the hot bar. I look forward to my next delicious meal."}
{"text":"Food: The food is yummy. My dad drives 40 minutes to get gyros in bulk from the Oakland location. The Strip District location keeps the same quality. I ordered the Chicken salad - the meat some well spiced, soft, and juicy. The only reason I didn't get 5 stars is because I like romaine lettuce over iceberg. But I can't complain too much, because they give you 4 servings of chicken on your salad. Well worth the $6.   Space: You couldn't tell from the outside, but the restaurant is a huge cafeteria like space. You are sure to find a seat for a large party. But the ambiance could use some work!   Service:  Fast, polite, accommodating. There is nothing to complain about.   I went around 1PM on a Thursday and it was fairly empty...though many people were buying TO GO. I think it's still a hidden gem for downtown!   Also the meet is Halal / Kosher."}
{"text":"My rating is a 4.5 that gets rounded up to a 5.    You will definitely not be impressed with the cafeteria style atmosphere, but it is comfortable and you are there for the food, not the decor.  Speaking of food, you get a ton of it for a great price.  The 2 curry, rice and vegetable combo is my favorite way to go.  I've had enough food to either indulge myself in one sitting and not have to eat another meal the rest of the day, or eat half, and then finish the rest as another meal later in the day - pick your poison.  The best thing in my opinion is the chili chicken.  The beef and chicken samosas are delectable and the wraps are delicious too.  The people working there were pretty nice as well.  Sometimes, they run out of a certain popular item and need to make a new batch, but they will bring it to your table as soon as it's ready to go.  Shame I only found out about this place during my last few months in Pittsburgh, or else I can see myself eating here at least once a week on the regular."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't been here more frequently! Do not forget to order the lentil soup. It's easily the most delicious lentil preparation I've had at a restaurant. The service is quick and without frills. LOT of food for what you pay, so go hungry. There's an attached market with middle eastern foods and I always stock up on dates, ayran, lentils and so on."}
{"text":"I was craving some Indian food tonight and didn't feel like spending too much money. After reading the reviews on yelp, I called Salem's to put in a take out order. For $14, I ordered a lamb curry, meat shwarma, garlic naan, and a baklava for my husband and I. These portions were generous and they did not skimp on the meat at all. I will be returning here for all my future Indian food cravings."}
{"text":"If I could give this place more than five stars I would! The market section has an incredible range of middle eastern goods from candies to halal meat and a frozen section. The restaurant is straight up amazing! It's not much to look at but the food is to die for and the people who work there are always so nice! I go here at least once a week to shop and pick up lamb curry with paneer and fresh naan. You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and friendly service. I am obsessed with their fresh hummus and baba, and my bf gets meals with portions leaving him stuffed - good for bf. I'm more of a light eater and enjoy a nice meal of hummus, baba and pita. They hand out free yummy pita bread or pita chips with your order which is awesome! A lot of people I work with also love Salem's. It's close to me, so I will be frequenting this place a lot!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food has been delicious. The meat shawarma platter was massive and very tasty. The second time I got the chicken tikka masala and it was loaded with chicken and had a ton of flavor. The employees are always very nice. I took a star away from the setting, but I don't think people are coming here for that!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice variety of dishes... I subtracted one star only because it's more of a casual place, cafeteria-style."}
{"text":"Salem's provides authentic, delicious, quality Indian food. Honestly, the food here is delicious! I'll tell you what you need to order . . . Chicken tikka masala with chickpeas and (when you get to the cashier) naan bread (made fresh). This entire meal will cost you about $12. However, this will be 2 meals, easy. The portion sizes are massive. Honestly, this place is a hidden gem. I'm half-torn writing this review because I selfishly want Salem's all to myself. It's seriously that good. What an amazing value.   The only reason this place receives 4 stars is because of the vibe inside. It's basically a high school cafeteria. That's what it feels like. But I don't care. I really don't. The food is amazing, and when you get to this level of quality you wouldn't care if you were eating in a horse stable (pungent). Kidding...   Parking is great and they even have their own little lot. They take card.   You have a hankering for some Indian food or maybe just want to take a step outside of your comfort zone? Perhaps you want to step back into your glory days of high school? Enter into the cafeteria serving pure deliciousness, which is Salem's. You won't regret that decision."}
{"text":"Not only have I been to Salem's to buy halal meat, but I've also been there to eat AND they catered my wedding! Because they were so extremely helpful in the catering, that's what I'll be reviewing them for (but also go check them out for lunch or dinner and to see their gorgeous mural!)  Salem's was wonderful to work with in getting catering for half of our wedding. Due to having a mixed cultural wedding, we had our venue provide half the food (your typical boring wedding food) and Salem's did the Indian half of our food (delicious oh so goodness!).  They gave us an absolutely full tasting with all of the aunties and uncles there too. Oh man, their chili chicken is sooo good (the hem of my wedding dress will agree because it got to taste some too when I dropped a whole bunch on it... whoops!). They were great and negotiating specifically what we would need and even gave a staff member to stay with the kitchen down there to direct them on not mixing halal food with non-halal food utensils.   Instead of a Pittsburgh cookie table, we had a baklava table - it was a GREAT SUCCESS. Needless to say, all of our friends absolutely loved having this as our catering. Even if you're not Indian or Middle Eastern, you should definitely think about having Salem's cater your wedding or event if you want a very memorable meal!"}
{"text":"Look!  Eat here and experience great food.  Great food, and dirt cheap prices.  The quantity of food you receive will make it almost impossible to finish.  The people working there are great to chat with, and are good at making suggestions.  They have a market attached.  I wish they would offer cooking classes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for food in general but today I wanted comfort food so I ordered chicken curry with rice, curried vegetables and chick peas. M-m-m good! The has the right amount of heat and the chicken and veggies are oh so tender. They have a wide variety of choices: burgers, fries, hummus, shawarma, goat and lamb dishes to name a few. The desserts are delicious too! The baklava is one of my favorites! The staff is always friendly and helpful.   The market has a wide variety of Mediterranean groceries and the butcher shop has halal meat choices, it's so fresh!"}
{"text":"Got the tandoori chicken meal, chicken shawarma salad, naan and lentil soup. Everything tasted delicious like usual. Also got this for takeout and very generous portions and packed nice. Always love getting food from here highly recommended."}
{"text":"The dining half of Salem's serves predominantly Indian food. The only Middle Eastern items are the meat and the chicken shawarma. I opted for the chicken shawarma sandwich which was about a foot-long and also filled with veggies and mustard. The mustard gave the sandwich an unusual yet interesting taste.  I also tried the yogurt drink. As a warning, it is VERY salty. It's interesting to try but tough to finish unless you like salt...a lot.  The market portion of Salem's has more items typical of Middle Eastern food. You'll find rice, pita, beans, and a myriad of sauces and spices characteristic of food from Arabia and South Asia. The largest part of the market is certainly the butcher's counter. (I'd like to clarify that Salem's has a butcher's counter not a deli counter). The meats are halal and priced comparable to Giant Eagle. They do sell a few deli meats but no where to the same scale at which they sell chicken, ground beef, goat, and other butchered meats."}
{"text":"Salem's is my go-to market when I want lamb or chicken. They also have a solid amount of Middle Eastern food stuffs and spices, so if you don't have an Uncle Samir to ship you za'atar, you might want to shop around the market a bit.  They'll cut any of their meats any way you want right in front of you and have prices that are not only affordably low, but surprising given the excellent quality of the meat. The only chicken I've had that's been cleaner and tastier than Salem's has been directly from the farm down the road from where I grew up. It's worth trying the pre-made marinades, too.  I've only eaten at the grill a few times, but was never let down in the quality or consistency of their menu. The cafeteria section is presentable (nothing to fawn over) and a fitting location to pop a squat with a buddy or two as you dig in to the feast in front of you.  This review is written with the market in mind and with the grill as an afterthought--seriously, try the meats!"}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of this place but lately I've kinda fell into a love hate type relationship. The shopping mart side is great and I love the fresh meats and how they cut everything right in front of you. Now as for the food court area it's been making me upset. I was here about two months ago and I got the rice and the tikka masala. As for the same thing today and both times have been bad. The flavor is invisible the chicken is so bland and it's just not there. It is disappointing to me because it use to be the best around and it makes me wanna stop coming because it seems the quality of the food has been downgraded. As for the rice it was normal basmati rice had good flavor. One thing that's really nice is they have two different baskets at the register. One has normal pita bread and the other has deep fried pita bread and I think it's awesome that's include free of charge. I really hope things change and go back to how it was before because I think this was one of the better middle eastern food spots in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I would give Salem's 15 stars if Yelp let me. When my wife and I lived in Pittsurgh a few years ago, my wife lived next to Salem's Oakland location, and it was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and the meat from their butcher counter was excellent and fresh. We literally saw them bringing in the day's selection.   So when we moved back to Pittsburgh and heard that they opened a new location in the Strip, we had to check it out.   The Strip location is amazing. I can't speak for the grocery side, but the schwarma, grape leaves, baba ghanoush and curries we've gotten from there have been spectacular. Everything is fresh, hot, and declious. They also give you every dollar's worth of food, along with fresh pita and pita chips.   Do yourself a favor and go eat at Salem's. Get a schwarma, a cup of their brewed iced tea, and enjoy. It's totally worth the trip to the Strip, and I definitely plan to be back."}
{"text":"Always the best place in town for fresh halal meat and delicious meals. Friendly staff and great prices."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service at a great price. It may not look like much when you go in, but do not be fooled. The vibe is so great in here with all sorts of people mixing together during the lunch rush. If the variety of foods seems overwhelming, take a friend, read some reviews, and bring an open mind to try a few things. Maybe things that look familiar!  My husband and I went and decided to split some menu items so I could try a variety of things. I really enjoyed the hot bar offerings. We had chicken tikka masala, spinach paneer, and chickpeas. The generous cuts of chicken were moist and served over rice in a slightly spicy sauce. This combination is definitely a filling lunch for one.  The naan shawarma should not be missed as well. It takes a bit longer than the items above since it comes from the grill, but they give you a number and bring it over. The shawarma sandwich is served on nann bread with garlic sauce, Mediterranean pickles and onions. The naan had a subtle garlic flavor which left me wanting more naan for sure! If you like gyros, give this a try sometime - very similar. Fries, are another must at this place too if you're a fan of perfect french fries.  Plan ahead for parking, the small lot nearby fills up quick but there's always street parking."}
{"text":"Oh man, I really like this place a lot.  So far I have only tried their prepared foods/cafeteria section, but I can tell you that if you (1) like middle eastern / indian food, (2) want to eat a LOT of it, and (3) don't want to pay very much for it, this is the place you are looking for.  Service is very fast.  The food is surprisingly delicious for how little it costs.  The average meal here will cost you between $7-10, and it's a guarantee that you will not leave here hungry.  The portions are GENEROUS.  And the food is TASTY.  I love the chicken shawarma sandwich, the falafel sandwich, and many of the items in the hot food \"meals\" section (which you can mix and match and pay for a single meal).  Their sides are also nice -- delicious hummus and baba ghanouj, among others.  Realistically I think Salem's is a 4.5-star place!  And the half-star docked only because I view it as a strictly to-go joint.  The sit-down atmosphere is set up to be quick and efficient...it literally looks like a barren cafeteria.  I would probably not have a sit-down meal there with friends (although, if you don't mind the atmosphere, it is VERY easy to find tables and nobody will bother you or get mad if you're being loud).  But -- for a bomb diggity carryout place where you can order there and get your food fast, Salem's is fantastic.  I can't wait to try meat from the market, too!"}
{"text":"Salems is amazing! They have the best nann in the burgh! I've never tried something there I didn't like. Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I stopped for some Halal food and decided to go with lamb curry over rice. In addition I was asked to choose a vegetable dish. I picked the spinach dish. Do not know the exact name.  Lamb is my favorite meat, however, this place was able to cook it with no flavor in it. Honestly, I did not feel that I was eating lamb. However they cook it, it does not make any sense. It has some spices in it, but could not decide what they are. The hot spice is just hot, without adding any good flavor.  The rice was plain and bland, not impressive at all. The spinach was obviously made from frozen spinach. Therefore you get no flavor of true spinach.   For $9, they filled the box with rice and put about 5-6 pcs of 1-inch lamb cubes. The amount was more than enough for a person, but without any taste, it can feed at least 3 people.  This place is lucky for not having a competition around them offering same type of food.  I also checked their market and felt sorry for whoever shops there. Their prices are unfortunately flying. These people do not deserve to sell halal. But, they will continue to this until their customers teach them they are not treated in a halal way. They can easily sell for cheaper, but they won't. Casue money is good and delicious for the. That is why they will not care about the taste of food as long as customer continue to appreciate this type of poor quality."}
{"text":"Several unseasonably sultry evenings ago, as I trekked on foot from my job on 39th Street in Lawrenceville to Altar Bar in the Strip District to catch Iced Earth in concert by my lonesome, I noticed a building bedecked by vibrant colors, and therefore, saw an opportunity to try a restaurant I've passed too many times over the years without stopping in.  When I entered, I saw a virtual United Nations in front of me dining in what very much resembled a cafeteria. Black people, brown people, white people, Muslims, Jews, and Libertarian Socialist Semi-Agnostic Caucasian Metalheads (well, at least one) could be seen partaking in Middle Eastern fare...as the Golf Channel (?) was on the telly.  The counter was a display of ethnic culinary glory. Pies, rice, proteins, and many spicy, exotic dishes beckoned for my attention, but I didn't want to dally, so I ordered a sandwich.   \"Hey, bra, what'll it be?\" a man, also bald, with a husky frame, moustache, olive complexion, and accent asked me as if I was an old drinking buddy.  \"I want the Lamb Shawarma with fries,\" I said.   \"You been in here before?\"  \"Nah, but I've been wantin' to stop in.\"  \"You headed somewhere?\"  \"Yeah, a concert down at Altar Bar.\"  \"Nice, man. This will fill you up. Get a fountain drink, sit down, and I'll take care of you.\"  And sit down I did, close to the counter so that my new friend wouldn't have to walk that far.  Yes, fountain drinks are self-serve here, and there's a 5 minute wait for sandwiches.  What arrived in front of me was an Arabic hamburger. The plush pita bread held chunks of a shockingly fresh, abundant, minced, moist, and flavorful lamb that oozed juices and was surrounded by pickles, tomato, lettuce, onion, and...mayo? It certainly didn't taste like the tzatziki I am accustomed to, but therein lied the charm of the sandwich. It was almost as if Salem's wanted something on their menu that would be familiar to Americanized palates, giving the everyday diner a worldly twist on fast food. Also comforting were the golden, battered fries that crackled between my teeth.   Not that I am at averse to ethnic food in the least. Regular readers of mine should know that. It's just that I was surprised at how \"American\" this shawarma came off and didn't mind at all. In fact, I practically annihilated the shawarma out of its sheer delectability, all while feeling more than welcome in this microcosm of an increasingly diversified city and nation.   And for under $10, does one really need to hit up The Clown or The Redhead?   After I finished my sandwich, one that was nearly as large as a rolled-up newspaper, I tried to stifle a belch only to get a smile and a nod from one of the employees. \"Man,I knew you'd kill that shawarma,\" I heard the man who served me say. I laughed, bid the folks at Salem's farewell, and made my way down to Altar Bar with a satiated stomach and a blissful heart.   Note: I was so full, I didn't eat again until 11AM the following morning. That shawarma kept me nourished as I fist-pumped, shouted lyrics, and dodged moshers past midnight in the hot, magnetic concert environs.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NaGPNeNVAzw"}
{"text":"Yummmm! I am pretty sure I dream about their food. I love going there because it is a lot of good food for a great price! This place is no frills with delicious food (which is exactly what I prefer). I usually end up getting their goat dish because it is hard to find goat that is cooked well in Pgh. I have tried a number of their other dishes also. I definitely recommend Salem's."}
{"text":"During the holidays stopped by the Salem's Market to buy a few items and some meat from the butcher area.  Very helpful staff at the butcher counter. We also stopped in the Grill for a quick meal.  Most others have already covered the essentials...ie;  cafeteria style, give you a number and they will bring it to you or you get up and get it when you number is called...someone was cleaning the tables and trying to keep up with the number of customers but it was busy.  I had the Kufta sandwich and fries.  The Kufta was very tasty and as others have said, the fries are really good.  For dessert had a pistachio mamaol that was delicious. If you looking for Gyros, Sharamas, fresh baked items Mediterranean sweets this a good place for a meal or taking home."}
{"text":"Stop by on our way to the Strip District!!! If decor is what your looking for then don't stop here BUT if AMAZING food at a reasonable price....STOP ON IN!!! We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Spinach Paneer and Lentil Soup!!!! DEEEEEE LISH US!"}
{"text":"Shawrma was yummy.  But the parking here is a bit dicey if you use a wheelchair as I do (gravel lot, no dedicated ADA spaces)."}
{"text":"Having lived in Dubai, Doha, and Manama for several years, this place definitely does a wonderful job of inviting me to relive some of my favorite culinary memories.   Wicked friendly staff, tasty food, wide selection. The market next door, also operated by Salem's is full of Middle Eastern goodies."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived in Lawrenceville for three years and this is my first visit. We got the shawarma, tikka masala, samosas, and grape leaves. Everything was absolutely delicious and we spent under $25! The atmosphere isn't the greatest- as its kind of an old middle school cafeteria feel, but the food more than makes up for it! It gets super busy on the weekend but their service is quick and friendly. Highly recommend and can't way to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This review for the management. I ordered  whole sheep as meal for my friend as graduation celebration. It started when i agree with him for 4 dishes for $400 and i told management that on Saturday some one will pick up the meal. On Saturday my friend went to pick up the order and the management played him and told him that they didnt make the meal but they will give another one for $477. I was really angry for playing me and cheating on my friend. My friend agreed to pay the extra money so he would get the meal so the invited people can eat. At that time when my friend picked up the meal, i called the office to get explanation. He said i saved your situation and get another sheep for extra money\" i was like what without telling me or calling me\"  i said to him my deal was $400 and not $477 , he said i ll give you credit for $77 at that time i knew he stole my money. I told him i need my money cash not credit he said i wont pay anything. This whole story was lesson for me and i wont back to that thief and liar manager. Be aware Saudi students in Pittsburgh and Indiana not to order from this dude in Salem halal"}
{"text":"Salem's always satisfies my craving of hot flavorful fresh Indian food. They have a parking lot, which is great since I am not a fan of parallel parking. Once you go in, just get in line to order. I was a bit overwhelmed the first time I went since they have so many options in the case and the menu hanging. They are also usually pretty busy. You can eat in or take out.   I ordered their chicken biriyani which they had in the case and then ordered lamb biriyani which they said would take about 15 min to make. It was totally worth it because that biriyani had so much more flavor than the one in the case.   Since it was takeout I just asked for sides of the chili chicken, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and lamb curry, because they usually just put it over rice. Also I recommend getting their naan, it's huge and fresh. All their dishes are pretty good and are great for take out. Prices are also very reasonable for the huge portions, you will definitely have left overs!"}
{"text":"YUM! I've never been to Salem's location, but have had their food many times catered at the office where I work and love it - so I wanted to give a review. I really need to visit their location. We usually have the chick pea curry, samosas, chili chicken and veggie curry. OH MY! Everything is truly out of this world. Their veggie curry has all my favorites - broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, zucchini. I love spicy food and all of this just really hits the spot. The employees that cater at our office are always so awesome. Handing out 5 stars to this place is easy. Looking forward to stopping by their shop next time I need my fix!"}
{"text":"As a specialty market, this really is as good as it gets, especially in da burgh. I had been to Salem's in Oakland once seeking a specific item, and the staff there was incredibly helpful, and when they didn't have what I was looking for, they made a few good suggestions on where to find it. The check out guy was not only warm and friendly, but rather dreamy to look at as well.  And then WAY back when they first opened, I went to the Strip version long before they opened the market side, and was not only drooling over the impressive line up of home made goods in the cafe line, but was also very impressed with the genuine friendliness of the staff - this was true friendly, not 'hi, welcome to Starbucks, here's your coffee, buh bye' friendly.  I ordered a few things for a quick lunch, and it was all incredibly fresh and flavorful, and the big burly guy with the shaved head and the sweet brown eyes talked to us like we were his new best friends.   I'd not been there since the market side opened, and finally made it there today, and was truly even more impressive than I'd imagined.   The cafeteria section grew, and it a true buffet of GOOD Middle-Eastern delights, both hot and cold, vegetarian and meat, meat, meat.  I picked up one of their rotisserie chickens, a container of hummous (some pita bread was free to go with it), and I was considering trying one of their own marinated and grilled steaks. I really just wanted to take a couple of raw steaks home to have on hand, but the butcher counter line was pretty long. So I started to order just a couple of the steaks raw, and they asked if I just wanted steaks from the meat counter in the market, and I said that I just didn't want to wait in line. So the cafeteria guy told me he'd get me a couple of steaks from the market counter, and he did. No huff, no attitude...true helpfulness. My friend ordered a chicken dish with a rice dish 'side', and a hummous, and the chicken and rice dish was enormous.  Now, if I'd had time and energy to wait in the line for meat, I would have spent a small fortune. It's all Hallal meat, so it is slightly more expensive, but the quality can't be beat, and the variety is pretty amazing. Lamb, chicken, goat, beef, pork...and nearly every cut imaginable, including stomach and intestines, and fresh ripe red. I WILL be back to buy meat.   The market itself has it ALL to make a perfect Middle-Eastern meal, from rices and cous cous, sauces, tahini, rose water, spices and seasonings, and in a greater variety and price range than other markets like Labad's in the Strip (which turned me off after a rant by the owner about gay people - 'I'll take their money, but I don't want to be their friend' - well, they get none of my money).  Once home, I yanked off a chicken leg and thigh from the rotisserie chicken, and started dipping into the hummous. The chicken was perfect - juicy and beautifully seasoned in their own marinade - true yum.  The hummous was excellent for a basic hummous. I like mine a bit more on the garlic/lemon/olive oil side, but it certainly was not bland and boring, and the 'free' pita was perfect with it.  My friend messaged me that what she had gotten was just as yummy, and she had enough to last several days. I will definitely be trying her chicken dish out one of these days. And when I'm not watching carbs, that dessert counter will be raided.  The crowd was quite international, a breath of fresh air in da burgh, and I have to say, the Middle-Eastern eye candy - damned near as good as the food. But then, I've always been a sucker for a short, dark complected guy with jet black hair and a prominent nose.   And I can't express enough - friendly staff. Helpful staff.   Clean atmosphere, stocked shelves, and even a sign that says 'Don't talk to the butcher when he's at the sawing table' - which means - fresh. It's being cut right then and there.   And even better and more amazing in the Strip - they have their own parking lot. I look forward to exploring more, and doing some serious cooking in the near future!  Now to just connect with that new habibi...."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's our go to spot for a quick lunch at work. I highly recommend pretty much everything.  The chicken burger is my favorite and I avoid eating the massive quantity of rice that is served with the options on the hot bar."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Indian food then this is the place for you.  The market has a private lot where you are warned to park at your own risk but makes it handy since parking in the Strip district can be a nightmare.  On one side is the market where you can purchase all types of meats and canned goods, etc to prepare and Indian style meal. The other side is cafeteria style where you can order meals, salads, gyros, or sandwiches.  Since I was having lunch with my son he ordered his favorite which was tandoori chicken and chili chicken. It came with vegetables and an Indian rice platter. I decided to settle for a lamb gyro since there was a sign that stated \" if you are ordering a prepared entree please allow 10 minutes.\" This is just a heads up if you are on a lunch hour as my son was. Cards and cash are accepted. If you order a sandwich or gyro then for a slight upcharge you can get French fries and a beverage of choice. You can order as take out as well.  First of all portion sizes are enormous! For Indian food yes it is very spicy including the vegetables that caught me by surprise!  The lamb gyro was just okay but I really enjoyed the French fries! My son and I were sharing our dishes and believe me we both ended up taking food home with us.  I would recommend that if you come here then as another reviewer noted bypass the gyros and prepared sandwiches and go for the authentic Indian food. Most of these foods are very spicy. However, I must say that you'll never go wrong with their French fries. They are one of the best I have anywhere!"}
{"text":"I got Spinach and Paneer, Chicken Tika Masala, and Kufta Kebab Meal.  I've eaten all of these things many times in other places and all are favorites. What I got was soo spicy that I had to mix them with condiments to be able to eat them! Even the rice was spicy. I'm not a sissy with spicing, but this food was hard to eat and I probably will not go back."}
{"text":"This might not be for everyone, but this is everything to me. Salem's makes _great_ halal food. Chicken tandoori, chicken curry, and lamb curry dinners are some of my favorites. My friend and I make it a point to go here at least once a week! The food is great and cheap, too!  The service is great, the men working always greet me as \"brother,\" which you don't hear anywhere else. This location in the strip is much bigger and cleaner than the one in Oakland, if you like middle eastern food or just want to try it out, you should definitely check out Salem's!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have gone there several times and the food on the restaurant side of the store is always fresh and good. The last time there I had the hummus (best in the burg) and spinach pie. Also had the chick pea salad , yummm! In the past I have had the chicken kabab, and kind of a chickpea stew served over rice. It is done steam table style so you can look over the food before you buy so you can try different things. Try the goat meat it's really good. The decor is like a cafeteria, so fancy it's not. The prices aren't fancy either. Two can eat for about $20, including a piece of baklava for dessert.. If just rating the food I would give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"If you want the freshest, highest quality Arabic/Indian food in the city, go to Salem's in the Strip District.  Walk down the line of food and select what you want from a variety of chicken, lamb, vegetables, and rice.  I honestly feel Salem's gets better each time I go and I assure you, I've been there a lot. I frequented the original location in Oakland for many years until they closed it and built the \"new\" one.  The food and service is outstanding.  The market next door is equally as impressive.  They carry the best pita bread in the universe - Pitaland.    The interior seating isn't suitable for a \"fancy\" dinner so I wouldn't recommend bringing a first date here but if you can get past that, which you should, Salem's is a MUST."}
{"text":"We usually come here to get food without an issue. Just recently there has been a new employee who always messes up orders and is very rude.   If we place an order for something we get something else. If we call for meat he hangs up, is rude, and very inconsiderate.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone anymore until the staff is taught how to work properly FOR THE CUSTOMER."}
{"text":"I've had many things here that I'd love to have over and over again. Like many others I love Indian food and I love coming here. The fresh baked naan is to me probably the best I've had in the city. The chicken tandoori is so full of flavor and the chicken always juicy. The portions are enough to feed a small family, I swear. Literally I've gotten meals here that I can stretch out for days as leftovers. The market is so much fun too because they carry all kinds of neat foods and other things you wouldn't find anywhere else. You can smell the goodness while walking up to the building from at least a block away. If you've never been, remedy that. Stat."}
{"text":"Holy portions Batman!!   This was my second trip to Salem's and second foray into Middle Eastern food per say and I wanted to stick with something simple.  I love me some lamb and I love me some rice.  So bam, done!   My friend, who I was with, is very educated on the subject of Salem's so I let her decide the dish for me.  I swear she said the dishes name to me three times and I still can't remember what it was called, technically.  So take note, I will be updating with the name!  I told the guy I love lamb so he dished out four BIG portions of lamb chops.  He won me over right there!   The first time I went I was a little on the fence about the place.  I ordered a lamb (of course) gyro.  It had WAY too much lamb and not enough veggies.  I like lamb, but not that much!  Plus, I think I may be used to getting them at fairs where they dump a ton of that sauce (Greek, ranch, who knows, it's good!) into it.  So this was just ok for me.   Second adventure in, success!   I love spicy foods, but I'm a mess eating them.  I cry.  I snot.  See....a hot mess.  But I still do it anyway!  So I blew my nose through the whole helping.  I seriously wolfed the whole thing down.  It was VERY good!  I know cumin is a very prominent spice in these sort of dishes but I'm not a fan of a ton of it, because then the dish gets too sweet.  It had just the right touch of it!   I always stare at the desserts, so I REALLY need to splurge soon. Hello, who DOESN'T like baklava!?  Good thing it's only a block from work.  There will be many more trips, perhaps to walk off the calories of future baklava purchases and consumption!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  I work nearby and come here at least once a week.  Even if you're not adventurous enough to try some of their Mediterranean dishes they have the most amazing burger!"}
{"text":"ugh i love this place. ive been here enough times to know who gives huge portions and who doesnt. either way, the food melts in your mouth and is soooo cheap.  i love the grilled chicken, saag paneer, lamb curry, chili chicken, and baked chicken (sundays only i think).   PRO TIP: a whole box lasts at least two lunches. get a \"small box\" to get rice and one item for $4.95!"}
{"text":"Middle east ,indian ,pakistani food ...there is a meat shop too where you can buy fresh cut meat"}
{"text":"Fantastic fast paced shwarma place. The food over all was really good with lots of a la cart options. In particular the fried kibbee was some of the best I've had and I've had many. Not much ambience,  kind of a high school cafeteria feel. But the food was outstanding."}
{"text":"Salem's has my favorite chicken gyro (and I've tried quite a few).  Most places seem to treat the humble chicken gyro as an afterthought by chopping up some chicken and putting it on pita bread, but Salem's has a delicious blend of spices and is juicy even without the cucumber sauce.  Plus it's HUGE!  First time coming I got the combo with fries, but it was way too much food for one meal (still delicious, I just didn't have a way to keep the leftovers).  The restaurant itself is plainly appointed with rows of tables.  It's been busy every time I've gone, but that's a testament to the food they serve."}
{"text":"I can eat at Salem's every day when I'm on the carnivore mode. This place isn't fancy but their food is fresh and good.   It's probably the most pleasant middle eastern food in Pittsburgh to my humble experience so far. Well, it's basically indian-middle eastern fusion. Or maybe more Indian or Pakistani.. Actually, I think it's more like Indian food, yes, Indian food. This place is half restaurant/half middle eastern grocery store.   I LOVE Indian cuisine. However, you don't want an Indian chef to make you a falafel sandwich. So I weakly recommend the falafels here. You don't want them to make you a gyro or a shawarma sandwich neither, so again I'm less strong on that too. Their kababs weren't fantastic neither.   However, how about, 1- half bird rotisserie-style chicken: it's one of the best I ever had! Nicely spicy, perfectly grilled, tender and scrumptious! You have to come at noon or early to get this.  They run out pretty quickly.  Unfortunately it's available only FRIDAYS!! Try it with their freshly baked naan. Their garlic sauce is not my favorite.   2- beef steak.  It's not Ruth Chris or Capital Grille but it's so tasty!! They make it well-done, so deal with it.   3- tried chicken tikka masala with byriani and it was a great meal.   Atmosphere is very casual and modest. But, it's packed during lunch time and I had to wait for 1 hour once. You see human beings from all races, backgrounds and hippiness level here."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a restaurant, buffet (during Ramadan), and middle eastern grocery store.   The restaurant is cafeteria style lots of tables close together with a lunch counter holding hot dishes like curry chicken and lamb with veggie and vegan options. They also have grilled meats like lamb and chicken cooked to order. Gyros, burgers, kebab this place has everything. Middle eastern desert like baklava are also available. The portions are large and the price is fair.  The Ramadan buffet is a special treat. Nightly during Ramadan from around 8 to around 10 they have a eat in or take out buffet. It's usually around 15 bucks.  The grocery is filled with spices, produce and teas. Great deals can be found. The wealth of uniqe and different ingredients is astounding. They have a halal butcher and will mix and preseason meat for you. I strongly suggest the spiced meat mix called kufta. They have different drinks and candy and fresh pita.   Go for lunch, shop the grocery, come back for a Ramadan buffet. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Another awesome meal. Had the kufta kebab meal which came with huge side of rice and 3 kebabs that were sublime. Not greasy and cooked perfectly. Also had the garlic Naan which was hot out of the over and it was the bomb!  Just go there an eat ,you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I have been to Salem's before just to get halal meat. This is the only place or the reliable place to get halal meat. A number of choices to select for different meat kind and types. They have a grill next door which I wanted to try before and never had the opportunity to do so. The time came this time and I step into check their menu. They have a choice of Mediterranean and Indian style food options. When I saw the Shawarma on the board, I decided to go for the chicken version of it.   I still miss the NJ Gypsy's grill Shawarma and this one in Pittsburgh came close to it. I loved the bread and the fold. The chicken was well cooked and the sauce was just the right amount. No dripping of sauce or any mess while eating. Neatly done. I will definitely go here again and try their other food item."}
{"text":"The gyros and shawarmas are pretty good over here. Some of the best we've had in Pittsburgh.   If you didn't come for gyros/sandwiches, they have a good spread of Indian (south Asian) dishes on the menu. The taste is good..nothing exceptional. I am a huge fan of biriyani and one complaint I have about their biriyani is that often times they use too much ghee.   Overall, definitely recommend you try it at least once."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue.  My wife and I go to Salem's at least once a week.  Usually we go for dinner on Friday night, or lunch on Saturday.  The staff there couldn't be more friendly.  I get the same thing every week - Chicken Tikka Masala with double cream spinach.  As you can see from the picture, it's delicious.  The portion sizes are always massive, and you never leave feeling hungry.   Other than the Tikka Masala, I also took a bite of my sister-in-law's burger one time, which was also of very high quality.  I once had the lamb, but couldn't stray away from the Tikka Masala.  It's tender, and the sauce is amazing.  I will continue to go to Salem's once a week even when I move out of the city.  It's that good."}
{"text":"I got the lamb nan shawarma, and it was delicious. I think I ate a third of it before I got full - it was HUGE. The nan/naan was nice and thick with lots of meat and veggies inside, and the garlic sauce is really good. The hummus was awesome as well, and I got a box of their assorted baklava to go.   One of the guys are the counter kindly told me what all the different types of baklava were even though he was slightly busy doing something else. You can tell they're very family friendly, and this is definitely a gem in the strip district! If you're ever craving middle eastern food, you need to try it! PS I also heard they have the best butchers in the city? I'm not from Pitt so I'm only visiting whenever I'm there, but great for you locals!"}
