{"text":"Great spot for beers and food, too. They have a vast selection of tall boys (obviously), and a really nice selection of draft beer  too.  The tacos are delicious.  I really like the warm, casual atmosphere and the super friendly staff.   They have both vegetarian and meat options, which is always nice if you are coming with a group.  Perfect place for a casual evening out."}
{"text":"IMO, one of the best beer bars in the city. Always a fantastic selection, including local and little-known craft brews. Servers at super friendly and knowledgeable, and they've always been very accommodating with special dietary requirements. Love the veggie burgers, nachos, and general pub fare. My go-to in Bloorcourt."}
{"text":"Excellent stuff. 

They had a great selection of craft beers that the whole table enjoyed. I had the Koreatown burger: double juicy beef patties with all things delicious and Korean in there. Fries weren't bad either!"}
{"text":"It was just close to where I lived. So, for me, it was considered as a good local place to hang out. it has decent beers with reasonable price."}
{"text":"Words cannot express how much I love this place! My husband's 30th birthday was coming up and I wanted to throw him a surprise party. I had contacted Phil, one of the owners of the bar, as he knew my husband to see if it would be possible to have the party there. Thankfully Phil said yes - and was beyond helpful with helping me plan the event and make it successful. Our seats were saved for us and Tall Boys had no problem with the Batman theme we had going on...Phil even added some special touches to make it that much more perfect.

Everyone that works there was incredibly sweet and there was never a scowl when we were constantly in the way of the servers trying to get by. I am also pretty sure that Phil handled our table entirely on his own, our very own superhero (I don't know how he did it...but he did!) 

Beer was incredible and everyone was happy with their drinks. I am not much of a beer drinker so Phil chose a beer for me and I absolutely loved it! 

The food is outstanding - you must try their burgers; My brother-in-law loved them so much that he ordered two! That's what you get when the meat is fresh and delivered from the butcher shop across the street daily. I look forward to going back and trying their Korean burger as I lived in Seoul for a while and am beyond thrilled that such a burger even exists! 

All of my husband's family and friends were blown away by this bar, the food, and the atmosphere & I had many people thank me for choosing such a great venue. 

Thank you Tall Boys for making my husband's 30th a memorable one!!!"}
{"text":"Happy to have this place in the neighborhood. The fish tacos are AMAZING- beer battered and pan seared. It's not even 8am right now and I would eat one. Great beer selection and decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Nice relaxed place for good beer and good company. Great downstairs room that can be reserved. Separate speaker system so you can have your friends DJ from their iPods."}
{"text":"They have some exotic beer varieties here. The pilsner that I ordered was very good. 

The star of the show for me was the pulled pork sandwich - it was fantastic. The atmosphere was good, but I guess that's expected on late Saturday night on this street. 

On the flipside, I had to send in the Nachos I ordered as a side for Fries instead because they were way too salty, so beware."}
{"text":"Great place for a weekday dinner and drinks.  Stopped by on a Wednesday night with my sweetie for burgers and beers and had a great meal.  The Koreatown burger was tasty and my only \"complaint\" is that I wish that my pile of delicious roasted autumn veggies was as big as the pile of sweet potatoes on my pal's plate :)  Enjoyed two local beers that we hadn't tasted before, Conductor's Ale and Amsterdam Oktoberfest.  I liked both but the slight smokiness of the Oktoberfest was perfect with the burger.  Great service and a casual comfortable atmosphere...we'll be back!"}
{"text":"All the food is fantastic, the servers are nice and have a good knowledge of the available options for beer. I've never had something there I was dissapointed with, and their nachos are always great for sharing with friends."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and some of the best burgers in the city. Hands down. This is my go to burger place. Love the Philly Cheese Steak Burger."}
{"text":"love this place.  the largest craft beer selection . they usually have specials and seasonals on tap.  their Koreatown burger is unreal, so is the Blossington.  highly recommended"}
{"text":"Popped in for a late lunch one Sunday in August and I was happy I did.  Great selection of beer on hand and the food was not so bad either.  The server was attentive and the prices very reasonable.  My son loved his fried chicken sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Had a huge selection of beers in cans (tall cans) and a few on draft.

The waitress was very good in explaining the different types of beers they had on tap.

We ordered the Whiskey BLT, Fried Chicken Sandwhich, Beer Battered Fish Tacos and Burger with Sweet Potato Fries. Everyone loved their food and it was very tasty!

Nothing to write home about, but overall a great little pub with a good selection of food and beer for everyone."}
{"text":"Great service. Great prices. Great beer and......Taco Tuesday!!! $3 delicious soft shell tacos. Need I say more....?"}
{"text":"Terrific service, delicious food and great portions. I had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of poutine. The sandwich was large and messy, though I was still able to tackle it with my hands. Tangy slaw and the scallion mayo was a nice and unique touch. My vegan girlfriend, though initially sceptical about the black bean and oat burger, absolutely loved it. It comes equipped with a dairy based sauce, but they were more than happy to swap the sauce with fresh avocado at no extra charge. Top meal for two at just over thirty bucks. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Go local, drink local! I am so happy there are places such as Tallboys, where the bartenders and baristas are so friendly, informative and enthusiastic about the drinks they sell. The variety and quality of drinks is outstanding. Everything is from Ontario and nothing is boring. Food is well-priced and sized for what the usual bar has to offer."}
{"text":"Dined here last night with a friend -- best way we both could describe the place: totally mediocre.

Began our meal with two $5-happy hour pints of Junction Conductors Ale - was a first for both of us and it was absolutely delicious.

Service throughout the night was slow as TALLBOYS was obviously understaffed with one server tending the bar and all the patrons in the restaurant. 

Next we ordered the Tall Boys Nachos ($14) -- unlike what the menu described, the nachos had little cheese, let alone being \"loaded with bubbling cheese\". For the high price, we definitely expected more from this dish. (3/10)

For our entrees we ordered the Classic Burger with Cheddar ($11) and Beer Battered Fish Tacos. The Burger was decent - nothing special - and fries were plenty salty. (5/10)
Fellow diner ate the Fish Tacos ($11) and said missed the mark - little flavour, and bland. (3/10)

A decent atmosphere with a good selection of beers would draw me back for a drink, but I would not be quick to order any food here."}
{"text":"Great selection of local beers, relaxed atmosphere and tasty food. Loved the pulled chicken tacos! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Medium quality food (actually the $3 tacos are fairly good value, but not the tastiest), and a large number of sports fans. Tightly packed usually. Lots of beer on tap, so if you like that sort of stuff, you could do a lot worse on this strip."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday on a whim because we needed food. We got the $12 burger special - pint and pretty much any $13 burger on the menu with a side of fries or salad. Great deal!  I got the Philly Cheesesteak burger. Lots of jalapeno and cream cheese, didn't seem to taste the onion or red pepper. He got the Bloomington, which was very similar to a Big Mac with a little twist in the sauce. The salad was delicious and fresh, light on dressing - it was almost invisible. I got the fries and they were solid. I was definitely impressed by their patties for a place boasting craft beer.

Minor drawbacks: It's a small place and it was a game night, so it was a bit noisy. I also only found out they were out of the beer I wanted when I went to order, which was kind of a bummer. 

I plan to go back when it gets warmer and try other things (especially burgers).

Not really any complaints but it just doesn't have the nostalgia wow factor to be 5 star worthy. However, that's subject to change ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after the gym during the World Juniors final between Canada and USA with my cousin. We snagged the last seat right beside the projector screen. We didn't go to watch hockey specifically so we didn't mind light glaring into our eyes when we did watch take a look at the screen - our nachos and burger craving was more important! 

We started off with nachos. We shared it between two people, but I think it could be shared between 4. We added chili and it had a kick of spice to it which I loved and it wasn't very runny, more meaty. The cheese was melted throughout the platter which was good, almost every 3rd chip had some cheese. It also came with a side of guacamole which was nice. The nacho chips were very oily and noticeably salty though. Although the toppings were good, I wasn't a fan of the chips. 

We also shared a regular burger. It was steaming hot when it came out and more massive than we exected- with two patties instead of one! It was tasty, but like the nachos, the main part of the burger - patty - was too salty for me.

Overall, I wouldn't say their food was the best I've ever had, but it satisfied our nacho and burger craving. The saltiness was too overpowering for us - personally, I felt like I drank as much water at the gym working out as I did while eating here."}
{"text":"We arrived the moment they opened and were not disappointed.
The server was informative and not intrusive. My boyfriend and I ordered a tall boy and a meal.
I had the pulled pork tacos, fantastic! The chips and salsa were really good too!
My boyfriend got the fried chicken sandwich, delicious as well! Everything was properly seasoned and very satisfactory.
Would definitely come back. Open until 2am on Friday and Saturday! Beers were delicious!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the beer selection is great, but I feel like this place is having an identity crisis. They are in a primarily hipster neighbourhood and label themselves as a craft brew house, yet have sports tvs all over, and often play dance music. Also, the layout doesn't really allow for group hang-outs."}
{"text":"Slow service, crabby waiters. They don't take plastic, only cash. What kind of business plan is that? Check out the bar next door instead.

Edit: In fairness, the environment was good (quiet, good volume) and the beer selection was stellar."}
{"text":"The place to go if you're into \"bartenders\" wearing baseball caps. A group of five of us were out for St Patrick's Day here. We sat at the bar. My super pretty female friend struck a conversation with the bartender, eventually asking for recommendation. He was friendly and served her and let her know the drink was on him. She spent the rest of the night talking to a buddy and I. 

When she asked him for her tab at the end of the night the promised free beer was on the tab. 

Was this a matter of the bartender in the baseball cap forgetting his promises, or a matter of him relinquishing the free drink offer because a female customer chose to spend her night talking to other men in the establishment?

Either way it left a bad taste in our mouths.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tallboys est réservé aux amoureux et fins connaisseurs de bières. Ici les serveurs vous expliqueront quelle bière est faite pour vous en fonction des saveurs et pays d'importation.

Tallboys is for beer lovers only. Here you come to enjoy a beer (or several) and also to know about its history. The waiter know their stuff and will take the time to sit down and explain to you the whole story behind each beer."}
{"text":"The craft beer is all the rage nowadays but doesn't do it for me. The list is impressive if you like this kind of suds. They even had an unlabeled beer can which might be a good thing for some thrill seekers but is kinda unnerving for moi. I stuck to the King's Pilsner. 
We were a larger group and we happily accommodated. 
We ordered some food as well just to fuel up. I ordered some sweet potato fries and some other diners ordered the chili. Both  were a decent sized portion and OK. I would say visit this spot if you are into the craft beer scene. 
2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Sooooo it's summer, perfect time for fresh beer and evenings out with good friends!

Came here with a good Yelpie friend, we had a great Monday evening. I ordered the \"Beat the Heat\" wheat beer and I absolutely loved it, it was incredibly fresh and with an orangy / citrus note that made the beer very tasty without being too sweet. The service was awesome, very welcoming, I asked some questions about their craft beers and asked for recommendations and they took their time to walk me through the menu while giving some good tips!

Burger was not the best I ever had but it was OK and it included two patties, which made the meal satisfying and very filling - and the blue cheese sauce was spot-on, not too light not too heavy, but creamy at the same time.

They do a pub trivia every Monday evening, in case you wanna enjoy your beer while you have fun answering general trivia questions."}
{"text":"Do you like girls who wear glasses, and boys who have beards?  Then this is the pick-up place for you!

This place just fell short of hitting the mark on all three things: food + booze, atmosphere and price point.  For two beers each, plus some really half-assed cheap tasting food, I don't want to spend $60.  I recently had amazing food, 3 drinks each, and spent 4 hours at Snakes & Lagers, and spent the same amount of money (for 2).  The beers just weren't served at the proper temperature.  I liked the selection, but it was way too loud in there to get into a conversation with the server about, like, what the beers actually were?  We asked about the honey beer and she said, \"It's sweet,\" as her only descriptor, and I drank it, but it definitely would not be described as such by anyone who isn't a seasoned beer-drinker -- it still tasted pretty \"beer-y\" to me, and we had originally asked about a pear cider, so she should have picked up on the fact we were looking, in fact, for a sweet beer.

Food was fine but pedestrian as heck.  Music was very odd (stuff I like, but not \"blast in your ear\" kind of music, and yet was blasting in our ears) and have the Leafs playing on a projection screen, but no tables facing said projection screen, is an odd lay-out.

I probably wouldn't purposefully be back, but I'm sure it really suits some people."}
{"text":"Good Beers and a Good place to watch Blue Jays. I had the new Brickworks Cider (Super tart)  and another crazy beer I can't remember. I had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and my girlfriend had the Blossington with Egg and Quack. Both very crips and fresh. Overall, this place is recommended by me!"}
{"text":"I'll try to make this short and sweet; the beer selection is great and the burgers are huge! Classic american diner food with a twist. All of the burgers come with two patties and start at $12. I got the Canadian and my date got the Smokey Bleu burger. The pulled pork on the Canadian burger was a tad dry but otherwise, we both really enjoyed our food. The beef was fresh and the patties hand formed. The burgers were so big, definitely not a first date food ;P The man and woman who served us were both friendly, laid back and chatty. We originally went there to try the burgers but I would definitely go back to try the tacos which also caught my eye!"}
{"text":"Fantastic craft beer selection with great food and super friendly staff. Owners/bartenders are super knowledgable about their craft beer. If you're a craft beer lover or just want to have some good food and watch the game this is definitely the spot."}
{"text":"Oh boy, this Tallboys Craft Beer House is phenomenal!

We ended up here after I have opposed to my friend's choice to go to one of our usual spots. I needed to try something different.
So, after driving around with our mouth getting thirstier for beer, I pulled over to see via Yelp, what was available around.
And this is how we ended up here.

At first sight, this place doesn't look very inviting but once again, this is one of those situations where you should never judge by the \"packaging\". It would have been a big mistake not getting in.
Tallboys is a rock-steady neighbourhood pub with local beers where you get to try out 100% Ontario Craft Brews, a nice way to support local businesses. The tap list rotates frequently and always features exciting options.

Now, the food. While wings and sandwiches are decent, the burgers is why you have to come here for. Burgers are without a doubt, one of the best in the city. I can comfortably say that Tallboy is in the top 3 best burger in the 6ix. Though, the double decker patties are occasionally difficult to eat.
The staff is incredibly warm and welcoming, and knows a lot about the large selection that they offer. While chatting with one of the bartender, she \"confessed\" me they only buy their meat from the local butcher, right across the street. All the beef is organic, grass fed and comes from Canadian farms. 

The place is a bit small (but a small place is also easier to manage all the clients and it should be easier to keep clean). In my opinion is too dark and that's the only thing I didn't like about the beer house. However, they've got a big open window that I have been told that is kept open on nice days. They also have enough screens to keep you up on big games. Great place to watch the Jays, Raptors or whatever sport is on that day.

So, overall, I think this is one of the best pubs in the city and surely one of the best on the Bloor St. W. strip. The food is great and it's priced right. Good selection of beers and a focus and support to local businesses/economy from the owner/s and management. Down to earth and relaxing environment for you to stop your frenetic day and enjoy some rest, either alone or with locals or with a friend.

TIP: get here on Tuesday. It's the burger special day. If i remember correctly, burger and fries are all $10."}
{"text":"Great spot for a night of drinks. The Hubster was introduced to a new beer he really enjoyed and I had some good old cider. We also ordered a pound of wings which were pretty good, nothing spectacular, though.

Service was really really great. Atmosphere was relaxed."}
{"text":"Popped in this place after passing by in Koreatown. Pretty close to the restaurants and other affairs in the area. Walked by and it looks to be a pub with one of those Garage Door openings and then a nice medium-ish size for seating which would be good for a full party of 20. As you walk in you are greeted with the Bar on the left with mainly most of the seating on the left. On the walls you are greeted with some old photos of Toronto with a beer can map of the different breweries in the province. 

Got seated pretty easily on a Monday I was here. Also was the day 2nd day after New Years. They were playing the World Juniors games on the couple screens they had with the projector. Service wasn't bad with the two waiters. Didn't take too long to get orders in for beers and some fries. 

Their beer selection is pretty good (30ish beers) from the beers being from craft brewers in the province with rotating beers on tap. Grabbed a beer  (Wellington Imperial Stout to be exact) from the place. Quite a good beer very full bodied with a decent ABV. You can taste those lovely flavors Dark Chocolate with a hint of Coffee. Do think it's a good beer to sit down and then enjoy for a bit of time.

Overall. Decent sized bar with a good selection and not a bad place to watch sports games. Pretty casual with a  ~$7 price for beers and about $$ stars for food price.
Credit cards are usually $20 tab FYI."}
{"text":"BEST. BURGERS. IN. TORONTO. I tried the Kimchi Burger. So good! It was really filling but also kinda messy but then again, the best burgers always are."}
{"text":"Eveylyn hosted the latest iteration of Cheap Pours and Sticky Floors which is a recurring CMYE theme that I have been attending for the past while.

OK so this place is a bar rather a beer bar and they have what can only be conveyed as a really really really long list of beers to choose from.  So long that you and pretty much almost every human being wouldn't be able to consume the entire list in one sitting and live to tell about it.  

If you like choices, this place has them.  I'm talking special beers, not Molson Canadian, Coors Light or Budweiser here... I'm talking different kinds of craft beers, special treats for the beer lovers that want to have a taste of something not so everyday and not so common.  No ladies and gents this place has the kind of canned delights that you wish were as widely available as water from a tap after you sample what could be and what should be.  

For somebody like me that happens to like new, different and special every once in a while or at least more often than not to change things up this is the place where I can live and die.  OK maybe that is a little too dramatic... let's just say I would love to visit this place more than once and more often if possible.  

To start things off we had some pitchers of Steam Whistle.  Now Steam Whistle is just a common everybody Toronto beer which isn't bad and in my opinion a lot better than much else out there as far as common beers go.  

As far as the menu went I decided to go for the Nicklebrook Immodest which was a double IPA.  It was a little pricey (almost 11 dollars) but let me just say that this beer was like what espresso is to watered down weak coffee.  This had a bouquet of hops when you brought it near your nose and the taste... well it tasted how it smelled and it was stronger (9%).  This was a special brew indeed.  It took me a while to finish it as I was savoring it for quite some time as it's not a chugging type of drink.  No, you want to enjoy this one and make it last if you can.
 
While it may seem I've gone off the deep end and in total infatuation with the the products served at Tallboys (namely the drinks) I won't neglect speaking of the food.  The menu for food is a pretty simple one, between a variety of sandwiches it seems that half the menu is dedicated to burgers or what you can have on them.  There is a special where you can have a single burger and a Steam Whistle for 12 dollars I believe OR you can order from the menu from the variety of specialty burgers as I did.  

I went with the Smokey Blue Burger which included blue cheese, bacon on a double burger.  The choice of sides are fries, nachos, a salad or poutine for an extra 3 dollars.  I just went with the fries but the fries I have to say were really good.  They were the furthest thing from just plain dial in type fries.  The burger was amazing.  They were top grill mashed patties and they tasted great with the toppings I had it was probably the best burger I've had in a place that is known to specialize in something else.

OK so I mentioned the sexy beer and great food but I won't forget to mention our server who was our host and the owner.  Phil was welcoming right upon my walking in the door.  Phil as the night went on I learned wasn't just our server or our personal host but he was the owner Tallboys and treated us like he wanted us there.  To me that's what is important.  You can have good food and good drinks but if you are the type of personable fun to be around and great to speak with kind of personality than absolutely your business deserves to have that 5th star in my books.  

This experience was an all around great night and really if I have to think there's nothing I could possibly say could have been better.  Phil is a guy that I want to hear speak and I want to ask him questions.  He is very involved in his business and his community and is very happy with the neighborhood and his neighbors.  

Tallboys is the kind of place I would love to make my regular place.  It's just kind of unfortunate that I'm going to have to instead make it my special place because I don't live close enough to make it a regular stop.  

Great things are being done here and the only problem I have is not being able to come here as often as I would like to.  Besides that this place is fun, good food, good times, good drinks and amazing service.  Kudos."}
{"text":"I really like Tallboys! For me, I find the service stands out.  The servers have found the balance between being super friendly without being super annoying. Always a win.

Great beer list, and the servers are knowledgeable about the products. Atmosphere is normally relaxing except I was there last night and around 8pm, they turned the music way up and it sounded like a terrible DJ broke his way into the bar, killed someone and took over the turntables. Not sure what that's all about, maybe it's a themed night that I don't know about? Anyway was weird for a Tuesday night and we ended up leaving as I didn't feel like shouting at my friend over a casual beer.

Ending on a positive note: THE BURGERS ARE SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. I have had burgers everywhere. I love ordering them, making them, eating them, they are the best. I've had two at Tallboys, the classic with cheddar cheese & the Blossington. Both were delicious, like juicy mouthwatering nicely cooked meat, great bun, everything good. Came with a nice big house salad, although I saw someone at the other table get fries and they looked awesome as well.

Overall, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Rude Service.

Our office just moved locations and landed around the corner from Tallboys. We were so excited to find a place with great beer that we could make our regular hang out. We had about 10 people with us and our server was extraordinarily rude. She basically didn't even have one ounce of kindness. It was like us coming into the bar was a major inconvenience for her. 

Do not order the deep fried pickles. They were ribbons, so they weren't juicy at all. Basically you're paying $8 for 1 pickle worth of dry pickle chips. 

We'll keep hunting for the perfect post work hangout."}
{"text":"I like this place.  The beer selection is great and the staff is super nice.  The only thing I would improve is the music.  Sometimes it's ok but sometimes they play classic rock stuff and for me that's a little bit tiresome.  Good music would take it up a notch and give it less of a suburb sports bar feel."}
{"text":"Finally, a bar on our block! I was beyond excited when this happened. 

So far, Tallboys seems to be doing pretty well. There are always people there, even at weird times. Huge selection of beer, and they always have great draught specials. 

Staff is always friendly and attentive. A huge plus for me. Food is more than decent, but not terribly memorable. We had a falafel burger, tofu curry on naan (cooked like a flatbread pizza) and the classic burger. All were good, but not outstanding. With time the menu will surely evolve. 

WIFI, TVs and cheap beer. Can't really go wrong. The music is always a bit too low for my liking, and selection could be a bit better. Lighting is dim and flattering for a late-night rendezvous. 

Looking forward to a packed DJ night in the future."}
{"text":"Service was good - Despite there being 1 server on for the entire place, at brunch - during the Santa clause parade. 

The wings were absolutely sub par - tiny, pathetic and not a nice flavoring. 
The black bean tacos were good, the chips for the salsa were amazing, the salsa tasted like water. 

The Caesars were good. nice and hot. 
The overall look of the place is... haphazard and sticky. Prices are great though. Need more TV's and separate channels in my opinion for the people there to watch the game during the day. 

Overall, I wont be back - too many other nicer places along bloor to adventure to. but I would tell people to go here for a taco! (and if your a beer person - good long list)"}
{"text":"You have to not mind if there isn't room the first few times you pop in,  or some other nervous Nelly excuse for not coming back to discover the killer goodness of tap rotation and fish taco authenticity."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've had in my adult life. Also, as the name suggests, amazing craft beers available in the best form: tallboys!"}
{"text":"Tallboys has some of the best burgers I've ever had.  Their tacos are also excellent.  Ingredients are always fresh, and they don't skimp.  The owners are there every night, and do they ever know their beer!  Craft beer heaven would be a pretty accurate description.  If it's Ontario craft and it's in a can, it's probably at Tallboys.  Not to mention they get a lot of one-off unlabelled cans that the breweries didn't shell out a logo for - meaning that you can only get it at places like Tallboys - not even the LCBO.  We are always treated so well there - and we will keep coming back.

Tip:  Bring cash if you plan on spending less than $20.  They have a less than 20 rule."}
{"text":"I love the beer selection and this is a great place to watch a game or a delicious kimchi burger. That being said, it's perfectly fine. Nothing crazy great or horribly awful about this place."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. Stopped in on the weekend and was lucky enough to get a table.

Food menu is pretty limited, but beer selection has a handful on tap (well priced at $5.75 a pint) and a couple dozen independent Canadian brands of tall boy cans. The fact that they shy away from mainstream and corporate brands definitely earns cool points.

As for the food, I tried the hamburger with bacon and cheese and will admit, it was a damn good burger. Sweet potato fries made a good addition but the side of chipotle mayo was tiny and only made it through about half the order.

One other thing that sucks is the fact that all the food is served on those cheap plastic trays lined with a piece of paper. As sauces settle, the paper tears and next thing you know you're eating pieces of paper attached to your food. I mean when paying $14.50 for a burger with its fixings and side dish, is it too much to ask for an actual plate?!

Any issue we had with the service worked itself out by the time we paid our bill, and while it was decent dining experience we won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Really sad to not have been able to grab a bite to eat here, especially for my partner since their burgers are raved about. 

We stopped by in between lunch and dinners for a drink and were pretty impressed with their offerings, brewery map and over all atmosphere. 

Nice window seat with the breeze was great. 

Will come back again for their food and drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, a lot of beer selection but I felt like they really only had one of every different kind of beer, so you're stuck with pretty much only one option if you like a pilsner or dark beer, etc or at least that's what it felt like when I went. I don't know what the vibe is though, not really a dive, not enough TVs for a sportsbar..."}
{"text":"I was all set to attend the recent yelp event held at Tallboys, but unfortunately my portuguese friend flopped on me last minute cuz he was sick.  He went into detail about his bowels and then recommended that I go to Tallboys for the nachos. 
He went on and on about how much cheese and toppings were on the nachos and how fresh the tortilla chips were.  When I tried the nachos, they sucked.  Barely any cheese, barely any toppings. MEH at best. Oh, but the tortilla chips were fresh (still meh). The nachos completely fail in comparison to Opera Bob's.  

I decided to order the Canadian burger with beer battered onion rings.   The burger was okay, the pulled pork on the burger has no flavor--you've been warned.  The onion rings however were spectacular.

 On the wings of the delicious onion rings, I decided to go back with my boyfriend and tried to order the same thing.  The rude-ish waitress informed us that they didn't sell onion rings anymore, but one onion ring still came as a topping on the burger.  So I disappointedly changed my order to wings because my Portuguese friend told me that their wings were \"really good.\"  

You know when you see the cast of survivor start to cook and eat random wild anemic animals, and you wonder how it tastes without seasoning or sauce? THATS what Tallboys' wings taste like.  I was very aware that I was eating a dead bird when I ate those wings. NO flavour.  Even though I ordered the Sweet Chili Wings, there was so little sauce and seasoning that all i could taste was the rawness of the flesh. I could taste that there was a struggle before the chicken died; the chicken fought to stay alive but got choked out. And it WAS in vain cuz the wings were NOT \"really good\" at all.  

When my boyfriend saw the beer selection, we were put off by how expensive the tallboys were.  $8.50 for a 473ml can of beer? ..like, get outta my wallet Tallboys!  Get out of my life.

Ur done.

2 stars. Big fat MEH.  But if ur a hipster you'll LOVE it tho."}
{"text":"Nice staff, great beer selection, good food. Pretty convenient location near the Ossington subway station too.

Tall Boys is known for their craft beers, and the list - all Ontario, all the time - is extensive and well-chosen. It's a good mix of a variety of breweries and styles of beer.

Don't go there just for the beers though. This place is popular with locals because the staff is very nice and the food is good. Try the wings or the tacos, and I have also heard good things about the burgers.

If you're a Jays fan, this is a great place to watch the games. They host different events when the Jays are out of town, or when they're not playing they'll show old Jays games. Goes good with craft beer."}
{"text":"This place is great for a casual drink or bite to eat. Everything we've tried on the menu (nachos, tacos, pulled pork sandwich, fried chicken sandwich) has been satisfying. Love the variety of beers and ciders."}
{"text":"Overall I give it a 3.5. They have a great concept.  Specializing in tallboy craft beers!  I'm not a beer drinker but my husband loves it!  Their wings are tasty and I tried their Kimchi burger which I would say was good but not out of this world. It was extremely hard to eat because it fell apart to easily and the patty was a bit on the dry side.  If they lowered the prices on their food I thnk they would make a bit more profit on the food side of things."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for an unpretentious drink with friends! I love the giant list of craft beer options with many available in cans or bottles, but I usually end up ordering from their rotating list of taps. The prices are fairly reasonable, the servers are friendly and informed (their recommendations have been spot on) and I love that there's enough beer variety to keep me coming back. I've been able to try something new on every visit.

I've only had the nachos and they were massive and filling with lots of toppings and oozy melted cheese. Mmmm nachos."}
{"text":"This place is great and not in the just kinda great kinda way. It's really great. Burgers are amazing. Nachos are beat in the city. Beer selection is off the charts. Loving every minute of it."}
{"text":"Great local bar. Great staff, food, events and selection of Ontario Craft Beer on tap and in cans."}
{"text":"A friend recommend we try it. I was not to keen but was surprised when I got there. The atmosphere was nice, the selection of beer was great. The thing that surprises me the most was the food. They had a really great nacho that was layered with cheese. But the burger.   Mmmmmm the burger was great. 2nd best burger I have had. This is high praise as I am a burger snob. This was amazing. It was juicy, flavourful and crumbled in your mouth. Did not need condiments. I recommended the smokey blue to anyone that loves burgers."}
{"text":"Super nice staff...  I left my umbrella there and they totally hung on to it until I came to grab it.  Yummy Nachos and everything else on the menu looked so good!  3 of us had beers and food and it was pretty cheap considering how great our service was!  Great beer selection, too.  New local!"}
{"text":"Came here after a comedy show at Comedy Bar for some beers and had a great time. Wide variety of beers for alright prices and service was good. Our server was very attentive and nice. I will probably come here again if I'm in that area (ie another comedy show!) Only complaint is that you can only use debit/credit for orders over $20 which is a bit annoying."}
{"text":"Tallboys is a casual place where craft beer meets the more traditional sports bar vibe.  We capped off a recent wilder than usual Tuesday at Tallboys after a disappointing stop at the pricey Northwoods.

The BEER: I'll start here, because, well, it's in the name of the bar.  They had a modest tap list of Ontario beers...it had a few good beers in it, and a lot that I'm not such a fan of.  I quite enjoyed the Nickelbrook Naughty Neighbor, which was quite a standout for Nickelbrook.  As the name suggests, they have a lot of tallboys available...it's a reasonable selection, but you're not going to get too far into the unusual or interesting category.  4 stars.

The FOOD:  Tuesday is taco Tuesdays...which meant we had tacos.  They were fairly good, better than most sports bars, not as good as Grand Electric.  The surprise standout was the nachos with house made chips...I'm a sucker for house made chips.  It's a large portion...share with friends!

The SERVICE:  The server was attentive and knowledgeable....pretty friendly.

The VIBE: Hipsters meets sport bars.  That means the guy raising his arm to cheer the Leafs on television has a tattoo sleeve ;)

Overall, it's a nice find in the area for a simple bite and pint."}
{"text":"My friends and I were going to a bar near by to check out a band but when we found out what the ridiculous cover charge was going to be we thought we'd try these guys out.

They have a great a selection of beers and I was able to try some new brews."}
{"text":"Ever since getting to Toronto I've been trying to find \"My\" bar. Having lived in a few cities across the country, I've come to realize that having a place where the bartender knows your name makes a difference. Seven months ago, after years of waiting, I was rewarded with Tall Boys!

First off, the staff here are great. The owners are clearly running a labour of love and it shows not only in the amazing craft beer selection (only from Ontario, best in the city), or the fantastic food (local ingredients, everything made in house), but mostly because they care deeply about the experience people are having in their bar. 

Secondly, Tall Boys is perfect in the things that matter, food/drink/staff, but still a little rough around the edges in the ways you want your local watering whole to be. If I wanted a perfectly decorated bar, I'd go to the Entertainment District where style over substance is the order of the day.

Lastly, they just opened their downstairs private room, and helped me throw a party for 20-30 people. This experience was the cherry on top, the difference between 4 and 5 stars. I have literally never had someone work harder to make my experience at a bar amazing as Phil (one of the owners) worked that night. 

They're still figuring some stuff out, which I find amazing because it means the place will only get better. As long as they keep focusing on great beer, great food at a fair price with amazing staff, my search for my Toronto bar has ended!"}
{"text":"This place has a good beer selection and gigantic tv's, but that's about it. I found the food really salty, the furniture was old and the washroom situation in the basement was brutal."}
{"text":"I went to TALLBOYS with the team after the game on a whim. They had a great selection of beer and I had the falafel burger which was really good and a great alternative to it's beef counterpart. Plus, the service was above par... I would definitely go again next time I'm in the neighborhood.

BTW  - The beef burger was pretty good as well (according to my friend)."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Tall Boys for a while and usually when I am in need of a solid burger fix. Most recently, I had their classic burger with cheese which is a double burger by default with all of the fixings on a toasted sesame bun. The patties were enormous and made from fresh ground beef and it is the best burger I have had in Toronto. The prices are reasonable ($14 for the classic with homecut fries - the cheese might have been an extra dollar). They also have a great selection of craft beer."}
{"text":"Chill cheese fries were better than expected! Knowledgable staff and pretty good vibe."}
{"text":"An absolute gem! Great place for a casual get together, watching sports games, or private event. They have a private room available at a really good rate. Staff are awesome and so friendly, great selection of beers, and better than your average bar/pub food. Highly recommend this place for anyone who's looking for a new spot to check out. I don't live anywhere close by but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Gord and I had supper tonight at Tallboys.  It has been a big hit with the craft beer drinkers and we've been wanting to go for a while.

I ordered the Classic Burger with fries.   Gord ordered the Crispy Fried Chicken Breast Sandwich with a salad.

We shared our sandwiches (so we had half of each).  Both were very good.  We made the mistake, though, of eating the burger first.  It was delicious!!  The chicken sandwich was good too but the burger overpowered it with it's taste and juiciness.  We should have eaten the chicken sandwich first.  I'd get both again but would probably have the burger more often.

Lindsay was our server and she took good care of us.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I tried to book the private room for my husband's 30th birthday, but unfortunately they were booked. It was VERY well priced, so I recommend considering them as a casual venue for a group for 20 people or less. Instead of Tallboys, we ended up at SPiN for ping pong and then found our group seeking a place to enjoy a few drinks at 11:30PM. For obvious reasons, finding a place in the club district close to SPiN for 10 people at this hour was NOT going to work. I called the owner who I had been speaking with and he said to come by. He got a table ready in advance and introduced himself when I arrived. Super nice guy. We order some nachos, beers, mixed drinks and shots. It was a great vibe - smaller, casual venue with a twist of hipster. Decent prices for everything. We had a great time and are looking forward to visiting again. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great beer selection (local and varied enough for everyone).  The owners are service industry veterans it seems, and are super friendly and happy.  Service is great.  Recommendations are spot on normally.    

The only thing stopping me from spending more time here is the atmosphere/decor.  The walls are painted cement grey, with a TTC theme that I don't quite get for the location.  The fluorescent light glaring out across the space from the bar fridge just makes it feel really cold and sterile, like sitting in a dark garage or the bridge of a Star Trek Odyssey Class starship bridge.  Feels even colder in the winter months.  It's a tiny place, but with a few new bars all opening up on the same block within the same month, the ones that are going to last are going to be the ones that people want to stay and drink in all night.

I have brought friends there at least 4 times and had a business meeting there once, because I live in the area and it's convenient, but the overwhelming consensus from my groups are always to retreat after one or two beers back to someone's house or apartment to continue drinking in a more comfortable environment.  I'd like to see this place last - might be worth bringing on a commercial interior designer or just a local artist who has the eye and ideas.

Edit
Had to add this:  Just saw some of the photos for this place here on Yelp.  First one was a screen cap from Facebook of the bar calling the neighbours \"fucking loser neighbours\" due to sound complaints.  As a neighbour to the bar, I wasn't one of the ones who made a sound complaint but my neighbour and friend in the building directly accross the street was, and it WAS a week night and even fucking loser neighbours have jobs that they need a good night's rest to be able to be up for in the morning.  I've gotta say, I'm not sure I'll be going back, after seeing this - maybe the owners aren't as cool and as friendly as I thought they were.  That's really low class, to insult the neighbourhood you serve.  Wow."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service. Great bartender and overall great vibe! Loved it!"}
{"text":"70 Ontario beers on tap, great food, and an old building with character. I am finally able to give out my first 5 star review of the year. Located on Bloor St West just south of Christie Pits, this hidden gem is my new go to place for a burger and a beer. I have to respectfully disagree with my friend Kathy H review on the beer. I had a pint of Steamwhistle and found it to be fresh and flavourful, but beer aside its the food that I love here. I had a simple basic burger with cheese and bacon, this was the best burger I have ever had in my life. Hero Burger and Burger Priest, you have nothing on this place. Tall Boys  actually get their meat from a local butcher that is rated as one of the best butchers in Toronto. Finally a pub that gets its meat and its beer locally and not from Costco. You know  the burger you had is great when you keep thinking about it an hour later.  Tip: Ask for the $12 Burger and Pint Special. Honestly, I would pay just $12 for the burger alone, it was that good. Definitely give this place a chance and put it on your burger bucket list, but don't limit yourself to just the burgers, I will definitely be back here to try some of their other beers and foods!"}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection.
Mediocre burger. 
Good service with fun trivia night on Mondays!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool. Great selection of craft beers in tall cans and a couple on tap. Staff is knowledgeable and chill. Everything (or mostly everything) is locally-sourced which is dope. Their fries are awesome and come in big quantities. Medium wings are yummy and the chicken burger sauced up was delightful. Very decent place but nothing really gives it the 'wow' factor if you're looking to impress a girl or something of the matter. Great for bar food and chill."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a burger and tallboy and absolutely loved this spot.

It's a cozy little place with a LONG list of craft beer cans.  They also have a few beers on tap but the tallboy list is good enough.

The menu is classic pub fare type food and I went with a good ol burger.  It was two patties which made this meal quite filling but it was so tasty so I managed to eat the entire thing.  You can choose house-made nacho chips instead of fries which was a nice change...

Great place, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Bar Crawl #2: Kensington Santa's Stache

If you are into local craft beer like me, you are at the right place. 

Tallboys has a great selection of crafted beer from Ontario breweries and if you want to try out some of the seasonal offerings, you are at the right place. For the holiday season, I decided on Santa's Stache from Kensington Brewery!

Bartender here is friendly and knowledge. Recommendations are right on and always fun to do some geeky beer talk with.

Food here is adequate to fill up my belly so I can drink more beers! I tried the Sweet Potato Fries with House Made Chipotle Mayo ($7) and Bowl of Chili ($8) which were quite decent.

I will definitely be back for more beers when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening around 5:30 pm. Small cramped seating area but friendly service. I ordered the Philly cheese burger with fries and my friend ordered the chili burger with nachos. 

The burgers where freaking delicious and a lot bigger than I imagined. The only complaint I have is that the burger and fries come in a plastic basket, and because the burger was so delicious and juicy the basket couldn't contain it's awesomeness. Leaving a mess upon our table. I had to ask for a fork to eat all the burger insides that fell out of the bun. Burgers range from $12 to $20, with a choice of extra toppings like a fried egg, onions, kimchi etc for a price.  

I'm not a beer drinker but it seems they have a nice wide selection. 

Definitely would come again if I'm in the neighbourhood and hankering for a burger."}
{"text":"Best burger in the city! You know the burgers have to be good when your buddy Scott skips lunch just so he can make room for these double patty beauties.

Great spot to get caught up with good friends over a few drinks and an amazing burger.

Great selection of craft beers (for you beer drinkers), I'm a fan of a good rye and coke myself, and this place delivers.

Recently tried the nacho side instead of the usual go-to fries.  While the salsa was OK, really liked the chips on there own.  

Will be back for another Thursday session soon."}
{"text":"Very nice place for dinner or just to grab a beer and watch baseball. We were there during our first visit in Toronto, staying in a AirBnb nearby. We got the recommendation from our host Tiffany. I had the classic burger and it was great. With some nachos and the homemade salsa. Very good dinner with nice people!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food here has gone down hill here. It used to be my favorite place and I would dream of a kimchi burger and sauerkraut ale or the fish taco. 
However, the burger was greasy/burnt and the salad was full of rotten greens. So, sad. 
The place still has a great vibe with friendly servers and fun beer. The salsa and chips with beer are my safe choices but I rarely go now.
I think a menu recheck is in order for me to purchase more."}
{"text":"It appears I was slightly hangry with my last review, and focusing on the food more than their above average beer selection and lovely staff. 

Time to toss the fine folks at Tallboys another star. 

I was just in for a little birthday party, and discovered they have a secret basement bar and room that you can reserve. If you like beer and secret rooms, I've found your place, pal."}
{"text":"Good bar! Good service, and a gigantic list of craft beers (cans/bottles). Good atmosphere, the staff knows their beers! That's important!

Unfortunately on tap, the beers taste nasty. Like dirty beers!! (unsanitary)

Generous amount of food for cheap, decent bar food.

$20 minimum for debit/credit (argh!!!!)"}
