{"text":"This establishment used to be in Robinson on Campbell's Run, they purchased this location (Formerly 4th Ave Grille) and brought their clientele with them. 

I've been in a few times, at varying times of the day. Went in around dinner time once, was never offered a menu. A different time went in for late evening drink with friends, kitchen closed at 9. After the bartender had to ask how to ring in a simple Yuengling, I was done. Had one beer and found a different place to go. 

The owners are present, but too worried about talking to their friends or having their glass of wine to help their one bartender/staff member. I've noticed a lot of turnover in staff in my visits (7-10 times) only saw the same person once. 

This place has always been a nice neighborhood bar for those who enjoy non-smoking atmosphere (all the rest in town are smoking establishments) That's about the only saving grace of the current ownership."}
{"text":"This place recently moved here from Robinson.  Even though it was closed for a short time in between owners, it doesn't appear to have any renovations done to it; plus it looks like they brought the old menus with them. 

We started off with the turtle soup & wedding soup.  I can't say the turtle soup was bad or good; it just wasn't my type/flavor of soup.  The wedding soup didn't even have any pastini in it but made up for it with an over abundance of grated parmesan cheese :(   My fish was good, but my husband was disappointed in the fresh hamburger.  Said it lacked any kind of seasoning.

The worst part was waiting 40 min for the sandwiches when it wasn't even busy.  The server kept apologizing and did comp us the soups and drinks. And I'm assuming it was the owner who was more concerned about having his customized floor mat installed than having his customers served in a timely matter.   Debating whether or not to return to try their ribs."}
{"text":"Very nice hometown restaurant with delicious food and friendly service! I enjoyed  the  meatloaf special it was reasonably priced and a very generous portion. They also have a nice variety of craft beers!"}
{"text":"Service is appallingly slow and I have yet to meet a waitress that knows anything about the beer. The waitresses have clearly never worked at a bar before, and I'm not sure the chef has ever cooked before. We used to come to this bar often when it was 4th Avenue Bar and Grill but with only three visits since the new management I know I will never return again. Awful."}
{"text":"This place....ugh...
I work at large engineering firm right next door. we have about 60 employees in the office and could be a great source of business but all my co workers have already given up on this place. because of the nice people i keep trying and trying and hoping to be pleased. Today was my last attempt and i can say, I AM DONE. 
Today i ordered a grilled chicken salad, no onion, ranch, for myself and an italian hoagie for a friend/co worker. my salad was covered in onions and the ranch that used to be homemade and so delicious is now clearly bottled ranch and beyond disgusting. i had to pick apart the entire salad pulling out all traces of onion as i am allergic. my co worker also said the italian sandwich was a let down. 
This isn't just this one time. i understand things like this happen. I have eaten there and specifically asked for no onion on my italian hoagie and it came out having onions on it. 
they are always out of MANY things so if you call for pick up or go in to eat, MAKE SURE you have atleast 3 back ups picked out as there is a good chance they will be sold out of whatever you order. the excuse will always be the same...\"the truck hasn't come yet\". why you would own a restaurant and not have enough food ordered to make sure you don't run out before the next delivery is beyond me. 
i have given this place atleast 5 chances and am let down every single time. all i wanted today was a nice taco salad but i was told they're out of taco salad. highly confused by that but it is the norm here unfortunately. 

the owners are very nice people and this place had potential but they just opened too soon. they should have taken time to get organized..."}
{"text":"As a fan of the former 4th Ave Grille, this place is a complete disappointment. The food, service, clientele, and beer selection has gone way down hill.  It used to be the only place in the Streets where you could get a decent meal and good beer in a non-smoking environment. No more.  The beer selection has slid dramatically, and I suspect the only craft beers they stock are leftovers from previous management. They even have cans of Pabst and IC Light on tap. I have to give them credit for having Pumking on tap @ $6.50/ pint, but I had to laugh when another patron asked for an Oktoberfest. The bartender, probably the worst I have ever seen, said no except for this Lenin something (Leinenkugels). The Grille always stocked several Fest beers and many pumpkin beers, but those of us with taste are obviously not the target market for DB. Oh, did I mention that you can get Jell-O shots or Gummi Bears. Then, there is the food....my wife ordered a cheese quesadilla as we thought it would be safe. After 30 minutes, she was served a few slices of Kraft singles in a tortilla, nothing else, and the worst excuse for a quesadilla that I've ever seen.  I was impressed that they had a BBQ night on Thursday with brisket until I saw it. They ran out at 6:00, and it screamed pot roast. Fortunately, I did not order it, but neighbors had it. It was stringy, and.....the only saving grace and upgrade is that the Cafe serves Woodbridge wine. The Grille had complete bunk. So sad for Cory."}
{"text":"We used to go to the 4th Ave (the former business that is now DB's) almost every weekend-great beer, great food, great service. This place is just awful now. They know nothing about beer and their food is awful. But ya know there's vodka soaked gummi Bears so that should make up for it. It's a real shame that such a great business left and we get this in its place."}
