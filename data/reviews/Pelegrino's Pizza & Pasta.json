{"text":"Best pizza in the North Hills hands down. The dough is unbelievably fresh, prices actually lower than some others, who don't compare quality wise, in the area. Great customer service and on time delivery. Can't go wrong! So far I've ordered the pizza multiple times as well as the ravioli and both have been great! My husband won't order pizza any where else now. 

Definitely have to try!"}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome I have to say. I've been down here for a few months now recent transplant to the area. We have tried many pizza places and none satisfied our pizza cravings, until now. We finally found one!  Very excited this will be our go too pizza place. A bonus is online ordering, love that they use technology and I don't have to wait on the phone hoping someone got my order and info right."}
{"text":"Avoid this place if you can. Bathrooms are dirty with nothing to dry hands with.  Took the family here because all the yelp reviews were decent.  Kids eat free pfffft don't believe it. 10.00 off any order over 40.00? Yeah don't believe it. I hope my experience saves other dads from this shotty restaurant."}
{"text":"Arguably the best pizza I had in town ! Restaurant is small but we were well treated ! We reached the restaurant very late, almost closing time..but still they showed a lot of patience ! We ordered chicken wings, paradise pizza and veggie pizza ! The crust is very stuff and tender. Both pizzas we ordered were vegetarian. All of them are delicious.. I will definitely suggest it to anyone ! 5 on 5 !"}
{"text":"Came in on a rainy afternoon for a late lunch after seeing the glowing reviews here. It was kind of dark inside, and what sounded like Italian Peter Gabriel was playing from the speakers. I imagine they do mostly a takeout/delivery business. It's not set up like your typical pizzeria, as they have a closed kitchen and no pizza by the slice.

I ordered a half meatball hoagie with fries and a can of soda, came in under $10. Portion size was generous; the fries were a whole plate. 

Honestly not sure what the fuss is about. Was I able to eat again that day? No. Was it tasty? Sure. But it wasn't anything special. I got the feeling that the meatballs were from a bag, and the French fries were your typical thick cut food service variety. The toasted roll was good, as was the sauce. Overall, I didn't regret eating there, but I won't be making a habit of it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery of two calzones here.. we live right around the corner from this location and it took an hour to get the food delivered. I wouldn't mind that but I ordered the gyro calzone and one with pepperoni and sausage, mushrooms and onions. I guess they forgot the meat because each calzone only had onions in it and the one had mushrooms. I liked how cheesy they were but that was about it. I probably won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The usual so-called pizza that is drowning in tasteless processed cheese product. Strangely, the three speciality pizza we ordered taste exactly the same - bland, unseasoned, loaded with flowing cheese like product. The place is very hot, no AC - the five minute wait for a take out is sufficient message to not even bother considering eating in. It is also in a strange location, next to smelly car repair shops."}
{"text":"Had their pizza for the first time last night because of the great reviews on yelp.  And everyone was right pizza was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Pelegrino's  did the most awesome birthday lunch ever!!!  I ordered for delivery 5 pizzas, mixed soda cans and a cake. They delivered on time got the order right, did a whole chocolate cake, which they don't usually do.  Everyone loved the mixture of pizzas they have and the lunch was a huge success. You guys are the best!!!! Thank you. Would order from here again"}
{"text":"3.5 stars due to the nice waitress.
I had a steak hoagie take-out since I cannot finish a pizza by myself. I love the bread which is crispy outside. The hoagie as a whole was good but not that great. The steak wasn't juicy/greasy enough for me. The red pastrami I had recently probably made me picky. 
I don't know whether it was because of the MSG or something else in the hoagie that makes my tongue so uncomfortable. I felt thirsty afterwards and had to drink lots of water to get rid of it."}
{"text":"This is the Only place I order from now.  Turkey hoagie with house dressing is amazing.  Salads always fresh.  The Calzone is no joke and they have really good moz sticks.  I could drink their marinara."}
{"text":"Nothing special..not bad, not great. Ordered chicken bacon ranch hoagie-chicken was hard to bite. Pizza was so-so.
Updated
As your client I ordered food from you guys to try your pizza and hoagie. The dough wasn't fresh at all. Chicken on a hoagie didn't have taste. But ranch was good. And that's all.
And if you are the owner  you shouldn't   Judge nobody to try your food.
and as friend of other pizza owners, I know who uses good products for their customers. That's my opinion. Try your best, guys"}
{"text":"I'm new to this area in the past year and finding a pizza joint that works for my tastebuds and lifestyle wasn't easy, despite there being a plethora of pizza places nearby. I mostly do delivery and anytime I put any specific instructions, they always got ignored until I found Pelegrino's. Instructions were simple, like less sauce on the wings, or more wings less dings. No other place got it right or even tried until this place. Delivery people are always polite and the food always arrives like 20 minutes before the actual time it's due (which I found out the hard way the first time and had to throw on a robe over jammies I had thought I had a bit more time to change out of, but I digress ;). The food is good - not over the top amazing but good decent food coupled with attention to detail and great delivery service - makes it a trifecta for me!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza. Best Sauce. Best Jalapeño Poppers. I'm in love!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals. You could tell that the food was made from scratch and not the stuff of chain restaurants. The pesto used for the pasta/chicken was fresh and yummy!  The salads and breads were good, too. Kids got pizza and it looked good - I'm looking forward to trying their leftovers!
Tiny eat-in area, but the delivery guy was busy.  Our waitress was attentive and very friendly.  Definitely a nice local gem - we will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm very glad I found this place, you could easily drive past it or miss it. You have to turn right before jiffy lube. The food is excellent,  they don't skimp on the topping and you can sit inside to eat.  Pizza places that you can sit down in are hard to find. The owner is great and he will explain anything about the menu you need to know.  The waitress is just awesome, I have never seen a nicer and more attentive waitress.  My kids just love her.  This is the only place I will get pizza at now."}
{"text":"Really great experience! Can't believe I just discovered this place but it is now my go-to for pizza and so much more!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time and I have to say, it did not disappoint! The Florence pan pizza and fried ravioli were DELICIOUS!! We will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"My husband and I were disappointed that our favorite restaurant closed early, and we weren't sure if there would be any good options opened at 10 pm. Thankfully I found this spot on Yelp and showed my husband. He wasn't impressed by the look of the place but gave in because we couldn't find anything else. 

I am so glad we found this place!  We both ordered fettuccine Alfredo and we both loved it!  It came with a HUGE salad, and I chose the amazing house Italian which tasted like there is balsamic vinegar in it. Then our entrees came out on a huge plate with two delicious pieces of garlic toast. 

Overall I am so glad we found this place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"As great as the food is (trust me, it's all great ) the service is even better... Very friendly people who make very delicious food. Cannot go wrong ordering here!"}
{"text":"Food was very good, but our server was the sweetest, friendliest girl we've ever had. She would have made it a great lunch stop even if the food was bad.  Which it wasn't, very fresh ingredients and tasty. Veggie lasagna as well, which is hard to find and nice for non meat eaters."}
{"text":"Pizza was frozen pizza quality.  They called it pan pizza, but there was nothing pan about it.  My husband ordered an Italian hoagie, which he liked.  I would not go there again."}
{"text":"Put in an order for pick-up and I ordered a pizza with sausage and mushrooms and tomato and it just wasn't any good. The flavor was just not pleasant. I got a side salad and it was quite a generous amount of salad but very plain and their \"Italian\" dressing was balsamic based, which is not my idea of what Italian dressing should be. Finally, I ordered a Tiramisu which for dessert which was only okay. I really wanted to like this place given the glowing 5-star reviews here. I probably will give it a second chance and stick to an Italian chicken and pasta dinner of some sort. Also, I might eat in the establishment to have the food nice and fresh and hot. My food selection pics are attached."}
{"text":"We have been trying local pizza places since we moved to north hills 5 years ago. This is my favorite by far. I love the sauce, has a bit of sweetness too it and the crust has a seasoned flavor also. Highly recommend for pizza that taste different from the rest"}
{"text":"Had a Lamb Gyro, it was good. Great cheese & great cucumber sauce. I tried to order online but the process was slow & cumbersome. Also the parking lot isn't well lit & hard to see from McKnight Rd. especially at night (it's between the Vitamin Shop & Jiffy Lube on the East side of the street).

Good food, worth another stop when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to try this place tonight. I am new to the north hills and I saw the great reviews, didn't feel like going any where or cooking so I gave it a go. Wish I hadn't. I ordered a large traditional style pizza and a dozen wings.  The pizza was the soggiest pizza I ever had.  They might as well have made the pizza on slices of white bread that were soaked in grease for 6-9 months, high school cafeteria pizza has a way better crust than this.  On top of the soggy crust, they put about 1,000 pounds of sauce and cheese. This was the heaviest, soggiest, grossest slop of a pizza I have ever eaten. The wings were done well, not too crunchy, not too gooey but the 'hot' sauce was terrible. Maybe some people would like a dark, brown sauce like this but not me.  I was hoping for an authentic 'buffalo' flavor but these wings were just smothered in some mysterious brown sauce that packed a lot of heat but zero flavor.  Maybe this was an off night, but i'd rather have had dominos 1,000,000 times over and really, that's pretty pathetic."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the food I received for delivery. We had ordered cheese bread and a shrimp salad. The cheese bread was rock hard and cold. The salad had a 4-5 shrimp, a couple pieces of tomato, and a few olives. The rest was lettuce. The delivery guy was very pleasant and early with the food though. I am not certain if I would want to try this place again."}
{"text":"This place just became my girlfriend and I's go-to favorite. 

The gentleman who both took my delivery order and delivered it (I could tell by his thick, but very enjoyable accent and personality) was very polite and entertaining on the phone. That came across even more vividly in person at the front door. 

He included two of each the blue cheese  and ranch that I ordered. I \"had to try them because they're made in house\". He was right. I had to try them. The pizza was amazing because of \"the dough made fresh daily and it's more of a Chicago style, unlike that dry stuff they serve everywhere.\" He was right again. 

Don't hesitate. Order this pie and enjoy. To that gentleman (the owner as well maybe?), thanks for great food and the experience to go along."}
{"text":"Owner called and offered me free meal delivery or eat inside and I am now very satisfied with this restaurant.  I fully recommend it to anyone, they are the nicest people I've ever met.  Trying the pizza"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, and amazing service!  My boyfriend and I order from here on a regular basis. The food is always so delicious. 

The last time we ordered they forgot our sodas and they called us to confirm that we received them. We didn't mind so we didn't bother telling them. This time they brought us the extra sodas in addition to our order. We weren't expecting it. It was above and beyond great customer service."}
{"text":"Pretty small of a facility but its size is fine in considering the amount of activity there.   We were the only people dining there at the time.  I reckon they probably get more delivery orders than dine-ins.  

Had a large pizza and an order of spaghetti with marinara sauce here.  The pizza was decent.  Very hot when served.  I only had the plain half of the pizza but on the pepperoni size they really filled up the slices with a lot of pepperoni.   The pasta was alright but it was kind of cold.  Served with a lot of cheese though!  No fountain drinks - beverages are served either in a bottle or can.  The food was eatable and not bad, just pretty average hence the 2 star rating. 

The service was pleasant.  The lady who worked there was very polite and friendly.  Kept checking to see if we were satisfied or needed anything."}
{"text":"I moved to north hills in October. When I moved here we tried Papa johns but they had horrible service and messed up the order. So we tried pellagrinos! Since then I haven't tried anywhere else! It is delicious food, not just the pizza but pastas and apps as well! They also have great service and very quick. I won't order pizza from anywhere else!"}
{"text":"I just put down my plate of delicious food from here and had to write a review. I ordered delivery from here off the Yelp app based on the 5 star reviews.  I loved that I could order right off here and most of the food had pictures beside it which was nice! 

We ordered hot and garlic parm wings, the meat calzone, and steak hogie. The wings were so yummy! They came with a side of Ranch and I'm not sure what special stuff they put in it, but it's bomb Ranch, I mean bomb bomb! The hot wasn't very spicey but they had good flavor. The meat calzone.. OMG this was to die for! I could eat this for days! The steak hogie was also very yummy! 

Delivery was quick and everything came piping hot. We will for sure be ordering from here again and I am so thankful this gem is so close to home! I need this in my tummy all the time!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Entree items are great! Wings are fantastic. Delivery is generally quicker than they say it will be, which is also great. To summarize, this place is great!"}
{"text":"I didn't like anything about the pizza I received. I asked and payed for extra cheese but there was no extra cheese at all in fact they hardly put any cheese at all. The pizza sauce was awful and the crust didn't seem fresh at all. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"While in the area went with friends for lunch had the Paradise Calzone. Crispy outside and actually cooked all the way through, combo of flavor was great. Probably the best calzone I've ever had. Friend had Pelegrino Special Pizza great tasting crust and toppings. Came to the table looking like it should be on the cover of a magazine. (Sorry so excited about the food that I didn't take s picture ) Other friend had Penne with chicken. Flavor was great and sauce had a nice rich flavor and was not at all oily like at all like a lot of places. This was a lot of food which we all ended up sharing and still had leftovers. The new owners were both there, they were very polite and friendly. Will definitely go back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I viewed their menu online and decided I had to try the House Special Pizza.  It was nice to have a pizza that offered something a little different, feta cheese, fresh garlic, shredded pepperoni and an assortment of veggies.  The pizza had a great crust and a sauce that would be most comparable to Papa Johns.  I wouldn't say that the pepperoni was \"shredded\", though. I'm not sure if it's a bad thing, but the pizza may have been a little too heavy with the toppings, which made it a little difficult to eat by hand, but for you forkers out there, this may be the place for you.  They had a friendly staff, too."}
{"text":"loved the pizza. it had lots of toppings. Great deal. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is awful!!! Very expensive for what you get!!  The spaghetti and meatballs was literally frozen meatballs with a jar of sauce!!!  And the Italian hoagie tasted like the meat was spoiled!!!  Don't waste your time and money going here!!"}
{"text":"First time in town overnight. Checked out reviews on YELP. The Palermo was one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten. It arrived very hot. My Greek salad came prepared in a very nice container and was awesome.
If you are in Pittsburgh and looking for delicious well prepared food, this is your place."}
{"text":"I was looking around for a new place to try and this showed up while I looked. I ordered the Pelegrino's Penne with a side salad. It came on time and it's simply amazing!! There was a enough dressing for the salad which was so nice. And the pasta was very good. A little over cooked but other then that it was very good!! I will be ordering from you again!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the best pizza I have ever ordered from the front end of an auto repair shop. The fact that the crust didn't taste like exhaust and there was no motor oil in the sauce is just a bonus."}
{"text":"This place has excellent pizza and hoagies. (That's all I've had so far) the cheese and meats they use are very good, and you can tell it's not cheap. I suggest giving this place a try if you are looking for a good pizza place."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, and we totally found it by chance! We are in Pittsburgh for a family member that is in the hospital and had to stop at the Target, which is across the street. We were hungry and spotted this little pizza place, and we are so glad we did! They don't have pizza by the slice, unfortunately, but it's worth getting a pie. They're not unreasonably expensive. We had the pepperoni rolls (8 large ones) and the hand-tossed Pellegrino Specialty pizza. They have yummy sauce and dough! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the hot wings(extra crispy) and have enjoyed every Pizza we have had here. Pepperoni rolls were very good also. If the place was cheaper I'd probably eat here weekly."}
{"text":"Got a gyro.  This is the second time I've eaten here and both times it's been thoroughly and completely forgettable.  I was neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, just \"Meh.\"  Seriously, I am partially writing this review to remind myself not to bother coming here.  That's how forgettable my experience was.  #flashything"}
{"text":"I stopped by here with my wife and another dining companion for dinner over the summer.  Whenever we walked into the place the first thing that we noticed was the heat as either they didn't seem to have air conditioning or it was broken.  To remedy this they had a couple of fans running but it was still pretty warm.  After we walked in we were greeted by a server who ended up being really pleasant throughout our evening and helped us to really enjoy our meals.  Since this was the dining companion that I go out with to enjoy pizza we decided on a plain cheese pizza as well as their specialty Palermo Special (Prosciutto, Chicken, Cheddar, Mushrooms, Goat Cheese, Pine Nuts, Garlic Olive Oil Base & Mozzarella).  Both of the pizzas ended up being really good and I thought that the soft pine nuts on a pizza made for an intriguing pizza.  Before we left the restaurant a discussion ensued about how many stars I was going to give this place.  Initially I said 4 stars but my wife and dining companion convinced me to move it up to 5 due to the pleasantness of our waitress.

The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  The service was awesome and the pizza was pretty good as well!"}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't great. I ordered here based on the reviews and the Pizza just wasn't good. I could get better pizza at one of the chains. Maybe it just sat too long but the cheese was super rubbery and slid off the pizza in one solid piece. The wings, however, were delicious. I got the wing dust and they were great. They were a bit small but delicious, none the less. Probably wouldn't get pizza here again but definitely coming back for the wings"}
{"text":"I just ordered from here for the first time and I ordered the chicken wings with the Parmesan cheese fantastic ,bitting into the Italian hoagie, mmmmmm , for me the delivery time was fast , the delivery person was very friendly,The only reason why I didn't give it a five star because I only ordered two things on the menu,would I come here again,  yes , great job"}
{"text":"I used the Yelp Order Online tool for the first time when placing my delivery order from Pelegrino's Pizza. It also was my first time ordering from this restaurant. I needed something quick and easy, so I ordered a 12\" mushroom and pepperoni pizza. There was a choice for traditional or thin crust; I chose traditional. However, when I opened the box it definitely looked like a thin crust pizza to me. If it wasn't thin crust, then the thin crust must be paper thin. Given that it was the first time I ordered from them, I don't really have anything to compare this experience with. As far as taste and flavor, I liked their pizza. I didn't love it, but I'd definitely order from them again. Their delivery charge of only .99 cents is a real bargain. What I enjoyed most about the pizza was that I didn't find it overly greasy. Everything was nice and intact every single bite."}
{"text":"I had friends from out of town in for the weekend and after spending some time out at breweries we decided to head back to my place in Westview to play some games and order a pizza. I haven't been in he area long myself and have only tried a handful of pizza joints so decided to go off of a recommendation from the owner of a local game shop called Game Masters. The suggestion was Pelegrino's and it did not disappoint. I placed a delivery order for a Large Pelegrino Special and 12 Garlic Wings. I was quoted a 45 minute delivery time and that was about spot on if not a bit earlier. The Pelegrino Special was a huge hit! It not only looked amazing but tasted equally great.  I really liked the crust and sauce while the toppings were all plentiful. There was a lot of cheese as well melted to perfection. I immediately knew this was the best pie I've had since moving to this area.  The wings on the other hand while passable weren't anything special in my opinion. They were fairly dry and not much garlic flavor. I was expecting more of a wet garlic sauce but this was more of a dusting. I think next time I would try the hot wings instead.  If you are looking for something new to try, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's a small business, and I hope that they will make it.  I ordered pizza via Yelp on my mobile phone because there was a $3/off specialty pizza coupon, but because of the Yelp/restaurant/Eat24 integration, Eat24 actually transacted the order, and I wasn't able to use the coupon.  If you want to use the coupon AND order through Yelp, choose \"pay cash\" so that Pelegrino can adjust it in the store for you.

I ordered 3 pizzas and they were all delicious. I will be returning."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just moved into the area and wanted to try a local pizza shop. The pizza was seriously the best pizza I have ever had!  We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered from the mozzarella sticks, to the chicken penne dish...INCREDIBLE!!!  Also very friendly staff from order taking to pickup.  I recommend this delicious lil gem to any and everyone!"}
{"text":"I was in the area for a college fair and really just wanted some good pizza! Well after reading some of the yelp reviews of Pelegrino's I decided to go for it. It was my first time ordering delivery from the yelp app. To my surprise it was really easy. Pelegrino's menu was easy to go through. I ordered The pepperoni rolls and a calzone. Oh my goodness! It is so much food! And not a lot of money! I was and am so glad I chose Pelegrino's. Now every time I'm in the area... I will most certainly be stopping by or ordering. Amazing! The sauce that came with the items... so good! All of it was amazing! Taking a ton of left overs to my husband! Can't wait to see what he says. I know he is going to love it! Delivery time was a little late, but they were really busy... so over all no complaints"}
{"text":"Whoa, I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet! Pelegrino's pizza is located on McKnight road. The same building has been 3 other pizza places in the 4 years or so I have worked on McKnight, the best lasted a few months, the worst was out of business within one month. Given the place's track record, I had low hopes for Pelegrino's. 

The manager/owner personally delivered my first order, and he was so friendly and the food wasn't bad that I ordered again the next week. Since then, I've ordered at least once a week from them. I can't say I am a huge fan of their pizza- I prefer NY style and theirs is thick, but not bad. They have baked raviolis that remind me of St. Louis, and their fettuccine alfredo w/chicken is sinfully delicious. I have tried it at Italian chains, small mom and pop places, local legends like the Village Inn in Verona, I've had it in California and Missouri and Italy, and Pelegrino's, this little pizza place, is hands-down the best I have ever had. 

They also go above and beyond service-wise. I ordered (via GrubHub) some alfredo last week and asked for 2 dr. pepper cans with it as well. My cell phone was dead, so when they called and left a voicemail saying they were out of DP, I didn't get it. They got here well before the delivery time said they would, and they had gone and bought-out two bottles of Dr. Pepper to make up for them being out of it. That is CRAZY good customer service- on top of the very friendly delivery staff, the decent pricing, and the delicious food, these people go out of their way to please their customers.  If you're reading this, give them a try. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very high quality ingredients. Stopped in for the first time today and was happy with the results. Got the 6.99 medium special with half pepperoni / black olives and half cheese for the wife. Good crispy crust... very tasty cheese and alright sauce. IMO the sauce could use some more flavoring. 

One warning... their prices are a little high (15.99 for a large pepperoni) but, given the better ingredients... it may be worth the extra cash. 

The high prices may be the downfall of this place because it was a ghost town when I went in for our pie.

Give the place a try... you will not likely be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The pizza is delicious and unique. Probably because they make everything (including the dough) from scratch. Get the thin crust (note: it isn't really that thin, which normally I wouldn't be cool with since I'm a NY-styler - but the pizza is so good it doesn't even matter). I even liked the red sauce, when we usually are white sauce people. Maybe I've been converted. Also tried the fettuccine alfredo and it didn't disappoint. The staff is so friendly and accommodating - definitely our new local spot for takeout."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some pizza and decided to stop at Pelgrino's.
It was not the kind of pizza place I was expecting.
I had walked in and there where no pizza slices anywhere too be seen.
They are more of a carry out and sit down restaurant .
They do not serve slices of pizza only small and large pies.
I got a small pie with black olives too go as the gentleman behind the counter said that that was the special a small pie with one topping.
The pizza was excellent and had a really good taste too it.
The service was excellent and the guy was very friendly.
I would definitely go there again and maybe even try some of there regular Italian food as the reviews look really good.
I definitely would recommend Pelegrino's for at least all your pizza needs."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome. The delivery is fast. I also love the chicken tenders, chicken bacon ranch hoagie and their ranch in general."}
{"text":"Drew is the perfect owner. I bet the shop will expand. The food is wonderful. The staff is superb. I would definitely visit again. If you're on McKnight Road & craving pizza, pasta, or a salad, then try this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"First place we tried in Pittsburgh. So good! Me and my fiancé absolutely loved their pizza and will be coming back the next time we are in town"}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing and I don't say that lightly.  Like others have said the prices are a bit high and I was skeptical at first, but it's worth it.  The staff is very friendly.  I have nothing bad to say about this place and they'll continue to get my business."}
{"text":"I've had their pizza and salads.  Everything has been great, and service is always fast and friendly.  I've been here multiple times, and have always enjoyed everything that I've ordered."}
{"text":"Good pizza and very reasonable prices - their pizza sauce is a little on the sweeter side, so if you're not a fan of sweet sauce, you may not be a big fan. I personally enjoyed the taste and found that they had their own distinct style versus other local pizza joints.

I'll definitely be stopping back when I'm nearby and trying some of the other items from their menu. There were quite a few options to choose from!"}
{"text":"My go to pizza place in the north hills. Great tasting pizzas and the veggie lasagna is excellent too. My wife says the wings are great too (I'm vegetarian). Not to forget, the staff are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Tried so many pizza places in Pittsburgh and this one is my favorite by far. Love the sauce. It is sweet and different from most pizzas places. Also.. The crust is like a butter crust. So good and so tasty! Their toppings are baked underneath the cheese which makes it even better!! Fresh and delicious!! I give it 5 stars! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yum!! We were visiting friends in Pittsburgh and wanted to do pizza one evening and found this place on Yelp. Called and placed an order and it was ready in 15 minutes! They have a parking lot and it is easy to go in and pick up your pizza. They also have some seating available so you can eat there if you prefer. Everyone there was so friendly and nice. Excellent customer service. We were going to use the Yelp check in offer ($3 off a large specialty pizza) but the guy actually told us they had a buy one get one 50% off deal which would save us more money, which was so nice of him! If you're looking for coupons they have a bunch on the back of their paper menus which are available on the counter.

For the pizza, we got a large cheese and a large Mediterranean. They were both delicious. We don't usually get plain cheese pizzas but our friend likes them the best so we decided to give it a try, and he was right, it was sooo good. They are very generous with the tomato sauce and cheese and it was perfectly melty. The Mediterranean is a good choice if you want chicken on your pizza. It also has spinach and peppers. It was very tasty and I would definitely recommend it. Two large pizzas were more than enough for five adults and a kid. We had more than half a pie left over.

This will be our go-to pizza place anytime we are in town now!"}
{"text":"Solid 5 Stars!

As a vegan working in Ross Park Mall, there are not many food options. So I turned to GrubHub, where I discovered the amazing and versatile menu of Pelegrino's!

I was able to custom-order a Pesto Pizza, sans meat and cheese, add-on extra veggies - even PINE NUTS! And it was soooo delicious. I loved the crust; super flakey and crunchy on the outside, and super soft on the inside. The Pesto tasted homemade. The veggies were fresh (not canned).

And as a bonus - they delivered it right to my store in the Mall, within a reasonable amount of time. SO GRATEFUL!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious! I work down the street and we order from them almost every day. Love everything on the menu. The salad is so fresh! Pizza and calzones are so good! Definitely recommend ordering or stopping in to eat there!"}
