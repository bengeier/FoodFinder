{"text":"I can't believe more people don't brag about this place!  I'm in the Rantoul area a lot during the work day and try to go here as often as possible.   You won't be disappointed. Their burgers are delicious and daily specials do not disappoint.   What you will notice is that everything really does taste fresh and homemade and that is rare in the restaurant world.   It's not a fancy place, but it's clean, has great food and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever! Simple all beef! I love the clam strips. The staff is super friendly and down to earth. Also all the staff is local! This is a simple down home old fashion burger joint. Don't expect prime rib and cloth napkins from a burger place. The name is called Butcher Boys Burgers! By the way this place is similar but much better the Just Burgers in Paxton. There is even a salad bar if you're into that. Love this place! Highly recommend it. The food is soooooo GOOD. And made to order! Yum! If you haven't tried it you should. Just remember its not lobster and cloth table clothes. Its a landmark. A down to earth friendly restaurant. Its casual. And has delicious freshly made food! So special to find a landmark like this."}
{"text":"Three stars because it smelled incredible! Minus 2 stars because someone that I think was the owner felt like finishing his conversation with his employee before even looking up to say something like, hello I'll be right with you. It was only like 3 minutes that I was standing there, but when you pull off the highway for this stop... It just felt rude. I left. I understand that people have their days and all, but dude?"}
{"text":"A great place with wonderful home made food and the best pies since my grandma. A must if you're close to Rantoul.."}
{"text":"Great dive with local feel. Burgers are great! Onion rings are breaded and great. Love the friendly local service!"}
{"text":"They only take checks and cash . The staff were dirty and brought my takeout container with gravy spilled on top. I asked them to wipe it off and and least put the container in a bag. This is the norm here.  Food presentation needs work. The worker then started telling me about how much he hates chicken livers, which I happened to order, as if I should care. The owner was \"sitting\" there at the front counter and said nothing. Not sure if he was trying to turn me off from ordering livers...just inappropriate customer service. The food was average, not bad and not great."}
{"text":"Seriously the best burgers and egg rolls I've ever had. In addition, they make pizza during the winter months that is excellent. The atmosphere is homey and comfortable. I drive 25 minutes to get lunch here. It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Cash only! Odd hours! I love their cheeseburgers and onion rings. They also have specials every night that they are open. I've also had their fried chicken dinner. Pretty tasty. Also, try some of their homemade pies. Yum!"}
{"text":"Odd hours, they take only cash, but really great food and is cheap!"}
{"text":"It looks pretty bad from the outside, but the food is good. The burgers taste just like Steak & Shakes. The fries, just like McDonalds. I was there at noon on Saturday and they were sold out of pies, which are supposed to be very good. The place is very inexpensive. I got 2 burgers, fries and a drink for less than 6 dollars."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian beef and I'm looking forward to checking out more menu options... the pies appear to be made form scratch - amazing cherry pie."}
{"text":"The quality of the food for the pricing is unmatched. Best burger joint around and some, I live for burgers and they never disappoint. Service is always polite and quick and I enjoy small businesses. Their blueberry pie is a favorite of mine and look forward to becoming a regular now that they accept card."}
{"text":"Really upset that I didn't get to eat here! After waiting 15 mins to place my order I find out that this restaurant does not take credit or debit card."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Cheap too! I liked the steak sandwich and onion rings a lot also. The only downside is the odd hours."}
{"text":"Love the family atmosphere they are the Nicest people at this family run diner"}
{"text":"We went to Butcher Boy after going to the reindeer ranch with our kids. It was 5:30 on a Friday night. The place barely had anyone in it. There was an older man sitting behind the counter who barely acknowledged us. He yelled for some boy to come up, who apologized and ran up to help us, and the older man told him, \"You need to shut up.\" Whoever you are, old man, you are a jerk and shame on you for talking to your employees like that. I don't care if he's your son, grandson, or totally unrelated - it is unprofessional and must absolutely never be done in front of customers.   After we ordered our meal - burgers and fries - we decided we were still hungry, so we ordered the frog legs. When we received them, they were still frozen and raw in the middle. I took them back and they refried them for us, but we couldn't bring ourselves to eat them. I understand why a small business wouldn't take credit or debit card, but cash only combined with the uneasy feeling we got eating there, makes me feel like this isn't the most honest place to get a meal. We'll never go back."}
{"text":"Everytime I have ate here the food has been delicious !! Best homemade Pies!!"}
