{"text":"Looking for lunch in the Beach? Here's your place. Quality, comforting food. Good menu options, labelled for gluten-sensitive and vegetarian diners; friendly service; a  cheerful but calm dine-in environment. The Montreal-style bagels did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Great pastries, curry soup is delicious"}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are the best in the world! The croissants are excellent, and the cookies are fantastic. And combined with a welcoming staff, it's a comfortable and delicious place to go."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. I've been twice now, hoping for a better experience the second time, but it was not to be. The coffee is watery and flavourless. The \"croissants\" are bland and doughy, definitely no hint of butter in them. The tarts-their specialty-taste freezer burnt and stale. And to make it all worse, this place is NOT cheap! Will never go back. There are way better bakeries within a short walk."}
{"text":"I stumbled into here with Tim Baker of Hey Rosetta fame when I was showing him around the Beaches; oops, wrong place i said, but he looked pleased with it and I said let's give it a try. Smart move! Vegan and veggie options with whole wheat and pumpernickel break, lots of in-house baking, huge mug of fair trade coffee, indoor and outdoor seating. And did i forget, really good sandwich, freshly made and it showed. They also sell Montreal bagels, which I didn't try, but i'm guessing, they're as close to Montreal as Toronto gets. Great to see another independent cafe and lunch shop doing well; they really help make a neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great local sandwich shop in heart of beaches. They have great sandwich combos and friendly service. The bagels for the sandwiches are very delicious. Outdoor tables are available for seating and great for a nice summer day."}
{"text":"The good, the bad & the ugly. I have not tried the menu extensively but I will comment on what I've ordered and experienced.  I'm a local which means I live close enough to this cafe to pass by it (at least once or twice a day) and have been a patron when the need has arisen.  When I say 'need', I mean it was a matter of convenience versus walking two short blocks further to find sustenance.  I know they don't make everything on premises, some of it is delivered or provided by other entities and this includes the bagels/bread.   The shopfront isn't exactly welcoming,  it's dark and for some reason the windows are always covered with bits of signs or half pulled shades.  If you like to see what's going on inside a store before you commit to entering, give this a pass.  The size of the shop is small, there's a few very small tables inside.  This is not an impediment if the cafe is empty or just a table or two are occupied.  Entering during lunch and you could find yourself bumping into patrons trying to eat their meals in order to get to the counter to order.   Outside they drag tables and chairs in which folks 'camp' (some with very ill behaved canine companions tied outside) to watch the world go by.  On a nice day, it can make passing by a bit of an obstacle course as the location is very close to a school crosswalk.  I had the misfortune of buying a 1/2 dozen bagels attractively displayed in baskets near the door for consumption at home.  I should have had not assumed they were fresh.  Within an hour of purchase, I sliced one and put it in the toaster.  Even toasted, you could tell they were beyond stale.  They were downright awful and I threw the whole lot out.  Considering that there's a wood fired bagel shop that actually makes their product on premises all day, every day just up the street, you would think that Naturalis would up their game, wouldn't you?  Nope.  My fav item:  the brownies.  I believe they're actually made on premises and they're very good.  I can't tell you if they're gluten free or not....but I can say that they're worth it.  The butter tarts are also yummy and worth the calorie consumption.  Coffee?  Neither good or bad.  I like my coffee with a bit of a kick.  A can of pop/soda/soft drinks is a tad pricey.  Again, walk a block or so to the east and there are other places that sell cheaper.  The only sandwich I've ever ordered/eaten from here is the tuna in two forms:  a croissant or a baguette.  I switched to the baguette because the croissant version tended to fall apart (not sturdy enough to support a spoonful of tuna) and it always seemed greasy.  The tuna to mayo ratio is very good but you'll most likely want to ask them to spread some mayo on the bread as well.  From a tuna salad perspective, this sandwich is a solid 7/10.  The soup.  If you're not a big fan of spice give it a pass.  They make their own soup here....everyday.  Not sure if it's from a pre-made base or from scratch.  I can attest that it's always heavily spiced. So much spice that the smell hangs in the air, stings the eyes and burns the inside of your nose as you walk by in the morning.  I can only assume that spices are used so liberally because the 'soup chef' has little sense of taste or they're trying to cover the fact that the soup is thin on ingredients or they do not have a recipe for a standard chicken soup.  I believe most soups are conducive to a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle:  if you're looking for a bowlful like your mamma made, this will not be it.  Depending what you're looking for, this spot could be a hit or a miss as a dining experience.  My advice?  Approach with caution."}
{"text":"Simone is very welcoming and kind. I always get a great bagel or sandwich. I recommend the Double Egg on a croissant with just Dijon. My go-to breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've been back to the place a few times since my review and am happy to say that the place has improved tremendously.   The changes made to the decoration had a huge impact. There's a new counter facing the street where you can grab a seat and watch the world go by. Changes were also made to the plates and coffee cups (which are now small and nice mugs).   Overall, the place looks nicer and cleaner. While the sandwiches have remained mostly the same, there were some nice additions to the menu in the form of empanadas, soups to go, cupcakes...   Keep up the changes and improvements coming."}
{"text":"Got the tiniest gluten-free bagel I have ever had - smoked salmon woth capers and onions. Taste is very ok. All that for $8???? Never go back."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here twice (they make a mean turkey sandwich).  The food is made of quality ingredients.  their desserts are also great...i had a brownie..yum!  Service is a touch slow, but it's a great neighbourhood place"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little coffee shop deep in the beaches. It's very unassuming from the outside, but once you get in it is very inviting and cozy. Other than the usual bevvy options you find at a coffee shop they have a decent array of pastries to quell your sweet tooth."}
