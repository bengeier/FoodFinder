{"text":"First time eating here. Not bad, good environment, excellent service. I've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant with good service and good food. Only thing missing was chili. The salsa they had just wasn't hot enough. It'll do but needed something hotter. Especially when you're eating menudo."}
{"text":"Great food!! Service can be hit or miss, but generally not bad. My family eats there often. Try The carnitas; they are amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoyed the food and the salsa. We also had very good service and did not experience any of the negative things that I had seen on Yelp. That being said, I have to mark them down because their prices are absurd! It's Mexican food- tortillas, chicken, beans, and cheese... You can't charge me $13 for that! That is more than my steak, salad, and side at Outback... Twice the price of a meal at Costa Vida (which is a Mexican grill in the same strip mall)!"}
{"text":"Lmao this place is a joke! The manager didn't even care, he kept making excuses. The waitress was rude and never came to check on us. I could have choked on my chips while I was waiting for a drink. This place is a joke and they need corporate to come in and see what us as customs are dealing with. I cannot believe I was treated with such disrespect! I will never come back here! Six other people got their food before me when I was their first lmao what a joke I don't recommend this place I'm sorry. & their salsa was watery and nasty! What kinda Mexican food place is this."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Manuels since they opened and it is our \"go-to\" place in the west valley for mexican food. We absolutely love the food and always have great service. The salsa is amazing (plenty of green chile and cilantro, yum!), as are the margaritas and sopapillas. Our favorite meal is the pollo especial. Plenty of options for mild mexican food lovers like me!"}
{"text":"What they are trying to pass off as Mexican food would make a Mexican cry.  I've had better enchiladas from a TV dinner.  The shredded beef on the taco salad tasted like bland pot roast.  The salsa...I don't even know what to call it? Ketchup salsa maybe?"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for chips and salsa and a cheese crisp yesterday. Food was good and service was as well. This is a good place to go to get good Mexican food. I have eaten here numerous times."}
{"text":"Salsa wasn't bad, but save your money and go to Taco Bell because It's pricey for bland food."}
{"text":"While I generally get a good meal today's lunch was disappointing. The summer special Taco al Pastor was not worth the money."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on several occasions and like the food quite a lot. I really like the salsa.  I have had shredded beef tacos at several Mexican restaurants, and like them here best."}
{"text":"I have never eaten here before, and I will NOT do it again. I ordered veggie fajitas. It came with zucchini, onions, corn and some kind of spicy red pepper. It was utterly flavorless aside from heat from the pepper. I don't think they even added salt/pepper. These were seriously the worst fajitas I have ever had. It comes with corn or flour tortillas. I had flour and they were good. It came with tomatillo salsa which was meh. The only thing I enjoyed aside from the tortillas were the refried beans. 

Talk about a waste of 12.75. I would have been better off at Chipotle."}
{"text":"I am giving 3 stars because I expected better Mexican in Phoenix than in Denver.  If it were in Denver, I would have given it 4 stars at least.  The frozen margarita was awesome however.  I could see if you are in Phoenix in the middle of the summer going to this place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three or four times in the past two months or so. I've ordered the same EXACT thing each time because, as a vegetarian, I am very limited in vegetarian-friendly menu options at Manuel's. The food and service used to be quite good and I've never had a problem with Manuel's until today. Every time I'm there, I order from the \"Mix & Match\" section of the menu. Any single item from the list with two sides is $9.75 and any TWO items from the list with two sides is $12.75. I ordered ONE cheese enchilada. I asked for cream cheese sauce, as I always do, because Manuel's enchilada sauces contain chicken and/or beef stock. As one of my sides, I always order the ranchero beans because they don't contain lard. The other side is always vegetables. I have consistently been charged $9.75, as it says on the menu. Tonight, when I received the bill, I saw that I was charged $12.25 for my meal. I politely asked the waitress if there was an error. She informed me that there's an \"up-charge\" of $2.50 ($2.50!) for the drizzle of cream cheese sauce that was on my enchilada! First of all, I didn't ask for something special that is not on the menu, that takes hours to prepare and is labor-intensive. Second, I have NEVER been charged extra at Manuel's because I have cream cheese sauce over red or green sauce so as to avoid meat stock. Third, nowhere on that menu is there any indication that patrons will be charged $2.50 for cream cheese on their tiny (and I mean TINY) cheese-only enchilada! So, I downloaded the online menu once I got home to be sure I wasn't totally crazy. If you look carefully at the menu, there is a whole different section called \"A La Carte\", and in that section, there is a $2.50 charge for any \"a la carte\" BURRO (not a teensy enchilada) if you order your a la carte burro \"cream cheese style\". Again, I didn't order it \"a la carte\", it wasn't even a burro, (which is WAY larger than an enchilada and therefore holds a lot more super expensive cream cheese sauce). And, again, I've never been charged another $2.50 at Manuel's for a dribble of cream cheese sauce tacked onto the $9.75 I'm already paying for a mini enchilada, some beans and veggies. So I simply told the waitress that I never saw an \"up-charge\" on the menu. I reminded her that I've ordered it before and I get the cream cheese only because I'm vegetarian and the other sauces have meat stock. (I'd already told her that when I ordered and she even rechecked to make sure the cheese sauce was still free of meat stock). I wasn't rude or incredulous. Neither was she. She, too, was unable to find anywhere on the menu that indicated that there's a $2.50 up-charge for cream cheese sauce. She said she'd speak to a manager and get the $2.50 fee removed. A few minutes later, she came back with a new bill and $2.25 removed (not $2.50). I guess they need the quarter. And, the reason code next to the -$2.25 said \"customer complaint\". What? I didn't \"complain\"! I simply reminded her why I ordered it, I said I never saw an up-charge on the menu and I asked her if there was an error. I wasn't snippy and I never \"complained\". Maybe their discount reason code should have said \"false advertising\" or \"trying to pull a fast one\". So, when she handed me the new bill with the $2.25 taken off, she said, \"the manager said he'd remove the charge THIS time, but NEXT time, you WILL have to pay the up-charge\". Guess what, lady? There won't be a next time. I remained nice and was placing my debit card in the bill holder when a man came over. He said, \"I heard there was an issue and you requested to speak with a manager.\" I said, \"no. I never asked to see a manager. I had a question about the bill but my server took care of it. Thank you\". He wouldn't budge. He wanted to know what the problem was. I calmly said, \"Oh, well. I didn't know why I was being charged $12.25 for my $9.75 enchilada. The waitress said it was the cream cheese sauce substitute. But I didn't know there was an up-charge. The menu says nothing about a $2.50 up-charge for cream cheese sauce. I always choose the cream cheese sauce because I'm vegetarian\". He said, \"Yes. The enchilada sauces have beef and chicken stock in them\". He said, \"I'll have to figure out where it mentions the up-charge on the menu. While I DO understand that you don't want meat stock, you WILL have to pay the up-charge next time\". A little consistency would've been good; I've never had an \"up charge\" at Manuel's before and I've always ordered the same thing. They used to be accommodating. And again, I could almost understand the \"up-charge\" if I had a heaping portion of cream cheese sauce on three huge enchiladas. But $2.50 for one little dribble on one tiny enchilada? And there is no mention of the cream cheese \"up-charge\" on the menu save for a la carte BURROS. I left there feeling like a scolded child."}
{"text":"Bathroom needs attention.
Carne Picado I always get :) this location was a bit over cooked but not bad for me to send back. 
Server assistant was on his game and very polite. 
Server was kind but dry :( personality. 
Decor was very pretty like all locations, and the gentleman that greeted us (server) was very upbeat and chipper with a great smile."}
{"text":"I have been going here for the Nachos Grande for years. I cannot tear myself away from them. I can't even order anything else. It's an addiction, what more can I say???"}
{"text":"Waited almost 40 minutes for our food to come out. Besides that we never got our cheese crisp that was supposed to be our appetizer. The waitress completely rude! Dont waste your time here"}
{"text":"Don't bother to go until winter. No A/c in the place.   No way you can you enjoy eating in their sauna."}
{"text":"They have great service. The meals are wonderful with an abundance of flavor. They also have a very pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Watched 2 different tables walk out due to service. The first time our food came it was wrong, the 2nd time it came it was cold. Took a whole meal to get a refill on a soda. Never again will I go here"}
{"text":"We love Manuel's! Always great food and service! We have a 10 month old and their high chairs fit perfectly to the table height."}
{"text":"My family went to this restaurant on a Saturday night . Walking in and seeing how vacant the place was should have been a sign to walk away. My family was seated promptly and the service was ok, One of the dishes ordered contained shrimp. The shrimp was horrible! It was tough and not fresh. The shrimp tasted as if it was cooked without being defrosted. The waiter was informed of how horrible the meal was. He took it back with the food still on the plate. 
We asked to see the Manager and after multiple request it took over 15 minutes for him to arrive. When we informed of the meal he said there was nothing he could do and would not refund the meal. The way he handled the situation was very unprofessional and rude. He then took out his phone and showed us a photo of the plate and it showed the whole plate cleaned off which it wasn't! This manager was horrible and should never run a restaurant. He was very unprofessional and I would never go there again!"}
{"text":"I'm coming back to write again not because the food is bad but because they raised their prices, which is totally understandable and fine BUT they also reduced the amount of food you get. We went this past weekend and my daughter and I normally share the carnitas plate. I'm not a big eater and it's normally enough food for both of us. Plus I ordered a side salad (ps, please make sure the celery is good before throwing it on there. It seemed a few days past its prime. And would it kill ya to put some carrot in there?)

Well, we get the carnitas and it's about half of what it used to be! There was maybe enough for 6 bites of rice and like a smear of beans on the tortilla. Very disappointing. The food still tasted good but I hate when places raise prices but cut quantity. Such a bummer. We spent $60 (including tip) on 2 adult meals, a side salad, a kids meal, and 3 drinks. Not sure if we will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Overall good service and good food. Delivered on taste and quality. The chicken and steak fajitas were tasty and the ground beef chimichanga could've had more flavor. The fried ice cream was perfect. With so many options in the area, it will be awhile before I go back simply because its good but not great."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch(I have never came here for anything else). Every time I come here I receive great service and a great meal. I would defiantly recommend for anyone who is looking for a good meal at a fair price."}
{"text":"We have had food catered from Manuel's on two different occasions and the food was a success.  Food was ready for pick up at the time we requested it and our order was correct.  Our guest favorite were the mini chimis!  I loved the layered enchiladas, chips and salsa.  The beans were good as well.  Best of all total price was reasonable.  Thank you to the staff at Manuel's!"}
{"text":"After moving to Buckeye from a small town with nothing but sub-par Mexican restaurants I swore I would never eat at another Mexican place again. Of course we were taken to Manuels for a \"thank you\" dinner from some friends. The 4 of us were immediately seated and after a short time got a hot bowl of chips. Now was my chance to try a fish taco. Nope, never had one and never wanted to spend money and not like it. This was a great  I must say!. Not battered or fried but grilled. The bummer was I chose the corn tortilla and was embarassed to try and eat the the darn thing coming apart due to steaming it. Nothing short of shoving it in my mouth made it possible to eat. I also looked like a slob because they don't give spoons so it was too messy trying to get more then 5 pieces of rice on my fork without it falling all over the place. Can't really rate the taste.  My husband and I returned for a lunch date and got there when it first opened. Kinda wierd that the chips weren't warm like the first time. Got the chicken taco salad and since I can't eat sour cream and wasn't going to eat the fried tortilla bowl I realized there's not much chicken in that dish. I got a heck of alot of lettuce though (I left a little hungry) We did have nice service both times and I did catch a cute (private) moment coming from the ladies room. One of the waiters was quietly whispering I love you to one of the waitress. They were embarassed when I tried to walk past unnoticed. Not the greatest place but I will go back as it's clean and I love the fish tacos."}
{"text":"We decided to place a take out order for two.   Considering it was Cinco DE mayo,  the wait was expected.   I picked up my order and noticed they provided a very small amount of salsa.   I politely asked for more and they said it would be an additional charge.   I asked if it was an additional charge while dining in,  she stated no.   

I do not understand why I must pay extra for additional salsa with take out while dining in is free.   Take out is cheaper for the restaurant,  less wait help,  opens up a table for another guest,  and no clean up.   

My first thought was leaving one star,  but the food was good, the wait was acceptable.   Therefore,  I gave three stars."}
{"text":"Fajitas were good. Probably  stick to just the chicken, because the steak was a bit chewy and in my opinion  the onions  needed to be a bit more carmelized. Overall  satisfied."}
{"text":"It's sad the food is good there happy hour is great. Gilbert is a great bartender but if Gustavo is behind the bar and your white just leave because he is not going to serve you unless he's forced to. I understand it was cinco de mayo and they were busy but after asking 3 times for a drink and watching him continue to wait on people who had just walked up and ignoring us, even the people sitting next to us commented on they couldn't believe he wouldn't serve us. This is not the first time he's done this so I guess shame on me for continuing to go back. Im in a mixed race relationship and my wife mentioned he seem to not like us! I tip well and have never been disrespectful so the only thing I can figure its race. There was an African American couple who also had to complain to the manager to get service. I do want to go back at least one more time so i can ask Gustavo or the manager why he doesn't want to serve us."}
{"text":"Yumm! Had breakfast there for the first time this weekend and it was great! Great service, nice atmosphere, and fantastic food!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Manuel's restaurants throughout the Valley for a number of years we have enjoyed their establishments and even took advantage of their catering on more than one occasion.  I had never visited this location before until some friends recently moved into nearby Litchfield Park.  We arrived around 8 on a Friday night so obviously we expected a wait.  To our surprise it was less than 10 minutes before we were sat at a large booth.  It was in the bar area (no big deal) the football games were on numerous TV's, people were there with their families, it was a good mix.  They even had a balloon performer making balloon \"things\" for younger guests.  If I had any desire to have a family myself I would have thought it was a fantastic idea!  Service was prompt but very average, there were 5 of us dining that night so when the piping hot tray arrived with four plates on it.  The friend to my left whispered to me what did you order? Gazing at the tray.  I told her that I ordered the enchilada trio ( which consists of three kinds of enchiladas rice and beans) We were simply making conversation when the server overheard and then began to explain that \"the tray can only fit so much\" \"mine would be right out\" \"I'll be back in two minutes\" I appreciate the attentiveness but I was not complaining that I didn't see my plate, I was answering a question by my table mate.  I do enjoy being mistaken for some fat impatient caveman who wants food NOW.  I may as well have gripped my fork and knife in each hand and pounded on the table ( his heart was in the right place) not the reason for the three stars.  The food was consistent and good as always but as I took a sip from my margarita (very good) my friend from across the table gave me a startled look.  There was something on my glass that was opposite me.  It looked like red smears of dried salsa or enchilada sauce.  We all discovered all of our cups from margarita to beer glasses had some variation of red food looking smears on them.  We concluded that they were once decals that had long since been washed off the glasses.  Now they resembled dirty glasses (for those who didn't figure it out it would have been a deal breaker) but none the less replace those glasses! I didn't feel like being one of those people who demanded to speak to the manager since I do genuinely like this place.  We paid our bill walked to the front to walk out and dispense our comment card with comments much the same as this to find an empty hostess station and two employees curled up on a cushioned bench having from what it seemed like very important girl talk.  They shouted \"come again\"to our backs as we walked out.  Great place, great family not so sure I'm going to visit this location again......."}
{"text":"Manuel's is my absolute favorite Mexican food restaurant of all time! The salsa is incredible I wish it could eat it everyday it's fresh tasting and not to thick but not soupy, just right. I also love there Mexican pizza, tortilla soup, cheese enchiladas, cheese crisp & and green corn tamales. They are all to die for, plus the customer service is great and feels very welcoming. I would  recommend Manuel's."}
{"text":"I have lived in far west valley for over two years and travel AZ for work so I've tried many many many Mexican food places. I have \"settled\" with Arribas down the street as ok but not amazing food, but THIS PLACE IS A MUST!!! I tried it on a Saturday (takeout) and ate there 2 more times during that week. And now they are catering my event!!!"}
{"text":"We have only been here twice, but both times we enjoyed our visits.

The food was really what had us return. The servers  are attentive and of course courteous but nothing out of the norm.

On our second visit we took our kids with us who both also enjoyed their kids meals. We know because they actually ate them! My son liked the music so much that he got up and started dancing. 

This might become a regular spot for us for when we want Mexican Cuisine"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner here and we all felt a three was a an accurate rating.  The food was OK with average flavor.  The staff was nice and addressed complaints efficiently.  One dinner was so greasy and tasteless it had to be sent back but they were very gracious.  I enjoyed my cheese enchiladas with an egg but the fish tacos were average and the chicken salad was average.  We would probably eat here again but would not crave it or trust taking guests again."}
{"text":"This is our usual Sunday lunch run after church -  or whenever the wife says so.

Love the Shrimp Picado, Steak picado with Eggs... the fried ice cream.   We have our usual foods that we order we don't even bother with the menu LOL - 

Can't go wrong with this place if you love Mexican Food -"}
{"text":"We had a great experience. The food was delicious and the staff were awesome.  We had a few special requests and they were very accommodating, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Only had drinks here, so can't review food itself, but the margaritas were good and the happy hour made them cheap! :) the bartender was really friendly. Chips and salsa were good too. Server checked in on us often. Overall good customer service."}
{"text":"First visit and probably be the last. The wait staff needs to be trained. We walked in and nobody greeted us so we just sat ourselves. The waiter dropped our silverware and never brought out more, just left it on the floor..really?? 

The food was ok nothing to rave about. They could get 1 more star however the prices are 15% too high. We can get better for less. I don't like the idea of not having beans and/or rice with the meal, felt a bit short changed there. They have a lot of work ahead to stay in business.."}
{"text":"I loved the salsa. My shrimp tacos were just okay. Next time I'll try something else.. The fried ice cream was fantastic!"}
{"text":"It ok so far let's see didn't what long to be seated the food was all right if your white but all n all it was ok will come back"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and the restaurant is dusty and dirty. They need to update the entire place. Dining in a room painted harvest gold and avocado green (like the '70s) is not appetizing. 
The staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Stopped by to have dinner and ended up only having drinks. The plates that were set on our table when we were seated were actually stuck the table top. We had to forcibly remove them, that was out indicator to have just a drink and leave. They did have a very good and heavy handed margaritas"}
{"text":"Best mexican food on the west side.   Nice people, friendly atmosphere.  Love the taco salad, enchiladas, and tacos.   The original margarita is the best in town.   Best chips and salsa too!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about but will do for an average meal.  Salsa was good.  Meal was average and service uninspired. At least we beat the dinner rush so there wasn't a wait."}
{"text":"I'm relocating to the west valley from OK and I was vet impressed by the food and service. Gonzalo at the bar area was extreme my accommodating and recommended that I have the three enchilada plate. It was one chicken, one spinach and one beef. The house margaritas were good too."}
{"text":"Had the menudo. My wife had the huevos rancheros. She said they were very good.
I was disappointed in the menudo. It had very little meat and lots of hominy. The taste was good though."}
{"text":"I was asked what I want for dinner tonight, I say Mexican. Okie Dokie then, where? I say Manuel's since we have never been, Okie Dokie then.

So we arrive and are greeting by three people and taken directly to a booth, which for me is strike number one. I hate booths my body is just not made for them. But there seems to be no tables. I assume the interior is meant to feel like an outside courtyard, it does not in the least feel as such. I am truly over the open duct work look.  But it is clean and not overpowered with music, and thank God no TV's. So we are then greeted by our waitperson, Patches. Yes her real name, I asked. Most wait persons could learn a thing or two from her, very friendly but not over familiar and patient in answering any question and making sure you understand the menu and what comes on the dish. I watched her take the same care with all of her quests, but not letting the attention delay her service.

Now on to the food. I did not like the chips and salsa, to me the chips tasted like cardboard and the salsa had cilantro. I do not like cilantro and if I am aware it will be in the dish; ask that it be left out. I had the tacos with pork. I liked this a lot, the meat was tender and very flavourful the cilantro on this comes in a separate bowl. My mate had the sampler plate; he did not like the food at all. He said it had a hint of flavour and that would be the same flavour for each sample. So he was not impressed. I doubt we will be back as there are other places as close to our home we like better."}
{"text":"We had not been back since our last bad experience but we were on this side of town last night and hungry for Mexican food so decided to try  again. Our experience was  completely different the food here has always been good last time our service just sucked big time. Brandon our server was AWESOME!!! He was on top of everything, extremely polite, and super friendly. He brought refills  of our drinks and chips before we needed or had to ask refilled. Brandon really changed my mind about returning here he is truly an example of how a great server should be!!!"}
{"text":"Great service! Excellent food and margaritas wow!!so glad we stopped by definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday afternoon, place looked ok. The food and drinks were delicious. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and I am unsure why it has a 3 star rating at this time. The good and service is always consistently great. We are always served with friendly attentive service. We have had the taco platter on several occasions and they are always so good. We have tried many other dishes on the menu and they are always great. Prices are not low-- but average for restaurants in the area. This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Goodyear/Avondale area."}
{"text":"16.00$ steak fajitas...I got 5 small strips of steak and 2lbs of onions and peppers... I know fajitas are usually a lot of peppers and onions but jeez!?!?"}
{"text":"As an Arizona native I have tasted good mexican food and bad americanized mexican food. (I like taco bell, but this was not as good).   We had not been here in a while and used to go to the ones in Phoenix and Tempe several times over the years but it had been a while.  We were very disappointed.    The salsa was not hot and when we asked for the smooth sauce which usually tends to be hotter, it was like eating tomato sauce with no flavors whatsoever.  The regular salsa tasted like chopped tomatoes but with no chili's or spices.  I am not sure if they were trying to be very bland but that is how it tasted.  We shared the sampler platter (small bite sized portions of different items).  The chips were greasy and tasted very stale.  The server was nice and the bathroom was clean.  That is why they got a star."}
{"text":"I was an attendee at a baby shower that they graciously held in their bar area... it was great to be around a bunch of drunk women and a crazy pregnant woman.

The server was very pleasant, she came back regularly to check on us and refill drinks.  We were able to order our own stuff if we wanted to or we could just eat the flautas or mini-chimi's on the table purchased by my gracious hostess sister.

Flautas and mini-chimi's... you can't go wrong.  Love that stuff."}
{"text":"Fast service friendly people. There is a big variety of food. A little on the pricey side for Mexican food.not the cleanest place I have ever eaten. If you are hungry the food comes out fast and it's good food."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived here on 7/01/2017 around 11am. 

We were sat quickly in a booth off the entrance. Our server was friendly and the gentleman who was helping her refill drinks and our salsa was very polite. 

Our food was really good! I ordered chicken fajita tacos and hubby ordered the 3 different enchiladas. My food came with two tacos in aluminum foil. They had chicken, green bell peppers and onions in them. Had a side of re-fried beans, (not fresh) sour cream, fresh guacamole, and tomatillo salsa. No cheese..... how can you not have cheese on your tacos. 

My hubby asked for a side of cheese and it arrived in a small \"to go type\" container. 

My cons of the place: Service was very slow, took forever to get our check, to have her pick up our check. Several servers were just standing around who could always step in to help. If it wasn't for the young man refilling our drinks and our salsa, I am not sure they would have be refilled. 

My little \"to go\" cheese side cost me $1.10. If I would have known that I would have made sure to use the whole thing of cheese on my tacos. 

For what we ordered with two ice teas it came out to around $38.00 and $45.00 after tip."}
{"text":"First time here and first time getting chicken tortilla soup. Would be cool if they offered a cup instead of an entire bowl for over $8. I have nothing to compare too but this soup was the bomb.com. I would come back just for the soup.  Wednesday kids eat free. Wife have chimmi was pretty good. The salsa was really good my kids even loved it. Only complaint was the special had chalupa and they are no longer offered."}
{"text":"Went here last night to meet some friends for a welcome back dinner.  Our server must have been having a bad day cause she was rude. I ordered chicken fajitas with NO  green peppers! They come out and it has RED peppers... she thought I just didn't like green peppers so she put red peppers instead... uh hello a pepper is a pepper!  That was a task to get that fixed. Won't be returning here poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Manuel's had always served delicious food to our family for many many years,  and this location is no different.  We love the Mexican pizza and could eat nothing but their chips,  hot sauce and salsa!"}
{"text":"Sit in the bar! Ask for Gil! Not only will you get a good meal but you will have the best service around!"}
{"text":"THIS is my NEW favorite restaurant in Goodyear!  GREAT service, love the bartenders they are very attentive!  THE food is another plus. YOU won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food!  I have had there food through the company I work for during our monthly sales meetings when they cater through Manuel's.  I picked up the food this time and was told it would be ready by 5:45.  I arrived at 5:45 to pick up food to feed 20 guys and it was ready to load.  I was greeted very positively right when I walked in and left with a friendly smile.  Good experience.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite.

I do not visit Manuels often however, a few friend of mine had a hankering for Mexican food and Manuels was the closest restaurant. When we entered the restaurant we were seated quickly and  our server immediately brought us chips, salsa, and our beverages. 

Maybe I expect too much when I go to a Mexican Restaurant but one thing I do expect is decent salsa, nothing you could buy out of a jar at a grocery 
store.  The chips were fresh however, the salsa was watery and a little spicy, it just wasn't very good. 

The menu at Manuels Mexican Restaurant is comprehensive, and offers a varied selection of entrée's.  On this visit we shared  a chili relleno, chicken enchilada,  cheese enchilada, red beef burrito, and a crispy beef taco.

Even though our entrée's arrived, piping hot, we all agreed the missing ingredient was a lack of flavors or taste. The food was hot and plentiful, but really had no taste. After lunxh we decided to end our meal woth something sweet. For dessert we  had the fried ice cream which  was delicious, the best part of the meal.

I want to end this review on a positive note by saying the service at Manuels is ourstanding.  Our server made sure our chip bowl and glasses were always full before we even asked.  Great service, generous portions, and reasonable pricing is what keeps people coming back."}
{"text":"Last time I went the fish tacos weren't good at all. I love the chips and salsa & the green chili burritos though. The taco salad isn't great."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I don't know what really to say about this place.  Although it's sit-down dining, it kind of feels like a fast food joint.  Not very comfy or inviting.  Definitely not very lively.  The service was okay, not great or even particularly good.  Staff seemed young and indifferent.  The food was okay, but all things considered, probably overpriced.  I ordered veggie fajitas and they were nothing like I'd expected.  The taste was good, but the veggies were soggy.  When I think of fajitas, I think sauteed bell peppers and onions and mushrooms hot-hot-hot off the skillet.  What they brought was more liked steamed zucchini and summer squash.  Super messy because the juice ran all down my arms no matter what I tried to do to prevent it.  I just really was unimpressed with this place so we probably won't be going back again, but the food was decent.  Wish I could say better things, I just can't."}
{"text":"Always my favorite lunch hangout! They have a solid staff who always greets you as you walk in and the food is to die for! I have tried quite a few things off the menu never to be dissatisfied. Our server is prompt, very courteous and always remembers our drinks and even our favorite menu options. Then there's Stewart who does their marketing and always comes out to say hello and see how the service is. Overall I give them an A+ and will frequent them until my weight says otherwise! ;)"}
{"text":"Great service order the chicken fajitas unreal can't talk enough about how good it was.   If you are looking for great atmosphere great food great service you have to try this place. Great job folks enjoyed it immensely"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Since my mom recently moved to Goodyear I've started to acquaint myself with this part of the Valley, largely unknown to me until now. 

Mom and I ventured into Manuel's recently for our first Goodyear dining experience. This is an Arizona-based chain with seven locations throughout the Phoenix area, that's been in business since 1964. The Goodyear location gets my thumbs up. It doesn't blow me away but it delivers on pretty much what I would expect from a local chain. 

The menu, Sonoran Mexican of course, is excellent and features all of my standard local favorites. No Mexican restaurant gets my approval unless it can make a solid cheese enchilada with rice and beans, and Manuels does. The chips and salsa, another fundamental, are good though the salsa's nothing to write home about. The service was average. The atmosphere is decent. I saw the place filled with what looked like plenty of other, local West Valley families enjoying their dinners. The prices are good.

I wouldn't go miles out of my way to eat here but this is a place to go if you're in the area and simply craving good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent service from waiters and bar staff."}
{"text":"We were here for our staff Christmas party.  We took over the patio and all preordered what we wanted.  I had the carnitas which were really good.  The portion was big and I had enough for lunch the next day. We had a great waitress who was very attentive and really nice.  If you are in the area and are in the mood for Mexican make the stop!"}
{"text":"Very nice, clean, place just off I 10 on McDowell, easy in east out. My wife had the Chicken Fajitas and I had a Steak Fajita Burrito with Jalapeno cream sauce. Plenty of very tasty grilled chicken in my wife's dish and hands down the best Burrito I've had in my life. Grilled steak O plenty and excellent cuts. Served piping hot and excellent service as well.  Macayo's no more.  Come here you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Don't go to Manuels... food is BLAND ,then don't ask for anything extra like 2 tiny plastic cups of green sauce,,, $2.00. Frys has 8oz for $1.00.Taco bell is much better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner with family from out of town. Food was excellent and service was above and beyond. We had a few quirky requests which were handled with ease and no judgement."}
{"text":"Very slow service, seems the employee that provides chips and salsa upon arrival was on break.  When the server finally greeted us, she said he'll be back soon, but didn't offer to bring some herself.  Food was delivered same time as complimentary chips.  The waitress never came back for drink refills until she brought the check.  We had to raid an empty table for a place setting as we were shorted.
The food was less than average but not awful.  Average value but leaning to slightly over priced.
In my opinion there are several Mexican restaurants in the vicinity I would choose over this one in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Starting my Paleo diet for the next 6 weeks tomorrow to cut up for my next comp so tonight I eat and drink like a king at Manuel's some of the  best Mexican food on this side of the town!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. HORRIBLE FOOD. NEVER AGAIN. Mother took me here because, BEFORE, she was impressed. This experience killed it and killed to the point that, there's a grave stone on top."}
{"text":"Here for the Fourth of July promotion and utter chaos. Saw people walk in and take tables that were not there's in the bar area. People waiting for Rhodes tables. Angry!
We wait until it is our turn and anyone can sit at bar and drink water and people waiting to sit as bar and order food!
We finally asked one of the ladies about a table that we empty for 17 minutes. She said yes. We waited an additional 14 minutes until someone served us!
Saw many others just sit down in the bar area and order food without reservations!!
Finally received some service and she was great. Still waiting On food. Ordered 5:04 PM and others sitting down after us with drinks and food. 
Upsetting 
Very seldom do I complain on line but--- Damn."}
{"text":"I moved to Goodyear Az in February 2017. Me and my wife were looking for a new place to try and we stopped here. We are so glad we did! I will start with the staff here, they are just great!! So very nice and polite, its just so nice to be treated in such a pleasant manor. The salsa and chips are very good, just as good as anywhere else. Salsa is very fresh, chips are good, not the best I have ever had, but I eat my fill. Me and my wife have been here a few times, then came back with my boys, we all agree, this is a great place. Drinks always refilled quick, and more chips and salsa? you got it!! Great flavors, hot food, nice servers, what more can you ask for? My favorite dinner is the \"El pollo especial,\" OMG, so very good! The chicken has great taste and seasoning, not just a plain chicken, love it! My son loves the seafood tacos, and my wife loves the Machaca dinner, sorry for mis-spelling. We have never had an issue with our orders, never had a rude server. Try it, you won't be sorry, you will just be full! I give Manuel's a very big \"Woo Hoo!\""}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, absolutely the worst food ever, got appetizer of 3 street tacos (chicken), 8 dollars, the 3 tacos put together would make 1 regular size taco, very small side of pico de gallo, no flavor at all, if I could choose no stars I would,"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. WAY, way over priced. We cannot get in and out of this place for less than $40. Its not only unreasonable for a simple Mexican food dinner, but it is ridiculous when your just ordering some tacos and a chimichanga. I love this place, I grew up coming here with my family but it is not affordable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for Valentine's day dinner. We saw it advertised on tv and the food looked really good. They all gave it great reviews. The food was alright. My husband had the enchilada trio and he said he really liked the shredded beef enchilada. I enjoyed my meal of spinach enchiladas.  It would have been better of the spinach was cut up smaller. I felt like I was eating a salad. The margarita was refreshing and pretty strong. We got there during happy hour so the beer was only $2.50. We finished sinner off with fried ice cream.  Oh man, that was the best part. We will be back to try something else at a later time."}
{"text":"I liked Manuel's. My wife didn't. Nothing glamorous here. Food is quick and easy. Didn't take long to look over the menu, order, and receive food. Prices are good. Went in for the Monday night special."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant very good food! Had a wonderful experience, especially because it is hard to find Mexican restaurants that do not use msg in every dish. My husband is allergic to it and the manager Alonso was very accommodating and even took a picture of the ingredients of the seasoning and change his meal just to be sure. Hard to find nowadays such a great costumer service. Definitely will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was average.  I had tortilla soup that was good, nothing special not bad.  The staff was ok, not bad but not super friendly.  The place needed a good cleaning, the walls were filthy.  If I was going to eat at a Mexican food chain restaurant Garcia's or Macayo's would be a better place to go."}
{"text":"It's official I can probably eat Mexican food every day.  Either for lunch or for dinner.  What else could explain two nights in a row?  

After a little pre-vacation shopping the husband and I were hungry.  Manuel's was right in front of us and we decided to go on in.  The weather was nice so we sat outside.  The seating here is very back yard with a pool seating.  Tables made out of rod iron.  Uncomfortable chairs that are angled weirdly.  Not the most comfortable.  Our waiter came over immediately (he was the also the bartender) to take our drink order, our chips and salsa came out shortly after.  I do have to agree with the other Yelpers.  What is with the small bowl of chips?  It would behoove Manuels to get a bigger bowl so they dont have to go back and forth 20 times for more chips.  My husband dislikes onions but also likes things a little spicier.  He ordered the hot sauce and it came in even a smaller dish.  He said it tasted like \"spicy ketchup\".  He still liked it.  

I ordered the Fiesta Platter.  A bunch of different things for $11.50.  It was good.  Their beans were delish.  I think that might have been my favorite thing.  The star in this dish was probably the mini pollo especial.  Several different things come out on one plate.  The pollo especial has a sauce tht they absolutely covered.  Inside is plenty of chicken.  You can see all of the big chunks left.  That was good.  It was a tad bit salty but it was good.  

My hubby ordered the # 1 combo dinner.  Red chili burro, cheese enchilada, beans.  He liked it.  If he's not talking during dinner he's into the meal.  Either that or he's just super hungry.  Our meal was good.  The wait staff was super attentive.  In a pinch it did just fine."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and ordered their special on Sunday of enchiladas,eggs, and beans. My daughter ordered the taco salad. The chips and salsa arrived with a small bowl of chips and huge bowl of salsa ( very amusing). The chips had a burnt taste to them but did not appear burnt. Did not eat emm. When our plates arrived the taco salad was typical, served in the fried tostada bowl and her words were, \"it's ok\". My plate looked ok until I noticed I had only one fried egg on my plate...strange..they usually come in pairs. When I mentioned this to our waitress, she said there should be 2 and said she would get it taken care of. A few moments later she arrived with a plate with a very raw egg on it. It was not even fried...it almost looked like a poached egg...but raw.I showed our waitress and she said that it didn't like right to her either , but the cook told her to serve it to me. I was upset...with situation and asked to speak to a manager. He arrived and I explained the events and he said..\"well I didn't see the egg, so I am not sure what happened\". I assured him it was raw and he said he was sorry and that he ask the cook about it and he left. he did not offer any compensation for it and as a matter of fact the waitress is the one that gave me an employee discount. The manager did not appear to care about the situation and the cook obviously could not even cook an egg...I will not return."}
{"text":"We have been going to several of the Manuel's locations for years,   This one is the best.  They bend over backwards to fill your needs. Even allowing us to sit at specific tables because it can get noisy, and my hubby has a hearing issue.   
Love the tortilla soup, mini chimis, el pollo especial,"}
{"text":"one word \"disgusting\"
The waitress was rude like she didn't want to help us... She served me and said they ran out of something and that she'll charge me half... wth? My stomach hurt after.. looks nice outside but the food is garbage. Don't come here..."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice. Service is good. Great place to come for breakfast ;) chips are fresh and the salsa is great."}
{"text":"My first time coming to Manuel's and was really disappointed. The waitress/bartender was really slow, they're usually quick about bringing you chips a dip, took approx. 10 min. I ordered the red Chimichanga. enchilada style, with red sauce, she brought it with green sauce, when I told her about the mistake, her fix was to bring a side of the red sauce... Not good customer service. I had an Arnold Palmer to drink, she never offered to refill it until I asked for the check. Now don't get me wrong, 1 bad day does not break this place for me. This waitress/bartender just needs to pick up her game if she's going to be successful here."}
{"text":"Went to this Manual's location for a birthday dinner with friends.  Ordered a Flauta w/rice and beans.  Half way through the flauta, I cut into a big, thick toothpick.  We called the manager and he said it was used to hold the flauta together.  It was too big and thick for that.  Offered another one, but I declined.  He never offered coupons or to comp my meal.  Sometimes they even offer dessert.  I wasn't looking for a freebie, but it would have nice to at least offer.  Won't be going back to this location EVER!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible - the food was not much better. We waited forever for our drink orders, but tried to give them the benefit of the doubt because our kids had to get milk from the bar. When we had to get the chip guy to refill our drinks, I knew it was no fluke. 

We then pulled up the Yelp reviews and read all about what we were living at that moment. But as we hasn't gotten our food yet, we still had to wait. 

I was full of chips and water, so I wasn't  able to finish main course. The only reason I took it home was because I was taught as a child not to waste food. 

Won't be back-ever. Wasn't all  bad, but with so many good restaurants within a couple of miles, eating here would be a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I found Manuel's Mexican Restaurant on my Packers Everywhere app, as a bar in Goodyear, Arizona, that would have the Green Bay Packers on TV! My friend and I went there for lunch on Sunday and I was so pleased to find the Packers game on their largest TV in the bar area. They had several other TV's showing other NFL games as well. The service we had was EXCEPTIONAL and we had delicious chips and salsa, quacamole, and shared the Combination Fajita's for two. All of the employees were friendly and I felt as though I was watching the game in my own house. I couldn't have been happier! I will definitely be back when I am in Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"We took a family friend here for some dinner as he was traveling from New Orleans to LA. I've heard good things and I've been wanting to try it for sometime. I can only speak for the Pollo Especial I had, and it was very good. Service was good, and our server even made sure we were squeezed in at the happy hour prices. 

If this were located in someplace besides the SW (say Indiana or Ohio) then I think people would be giving this 5-stars. But here in the valley, there are much more flavorful and authentic Northern Mexican places to eat."}
{"text":"I recieved a coupon in the mail for a free entree since we just moved into the neighborhood. When we went for supper I was surprised at how quiet the place was for the meal time. They had a wide range for kids meals which was wonderful! My daughter totally appreciated it. I ordered the El Pollo Especial and my daughter had a cheese crisp and both of us devoured our food. Super yummy and well cooked. The prices were a little high for what food we got but I would go back."}
{"text":"I have no comment on food for this place since I just went there one afternoon for happy hour drinks. The place was not busy as it was 6pm on a Thursday evening. We walk in, the two hosts are standing at the podium carrying a conversation which was more than likely gossip of the drama there lol. we walk in, the host hands us two menus, continues their conversation, and points us to the dining area/ bar area. Surprising. So we walk in the direction that they pointed us to and picked a place to sit. The sangria drink was pretty gross and tasted like a virgin ( virgin drink that is). The chips and salsa were good but the server was not so good. Didn't really talk to us, he did take our order, did not inform us happy hour details and became annoyed when asked about them and told me to look at the menu. The server did not inform us as to how much time was left for happy hour out of courtesy. So some of our drinks were charged for full price due to not knowing of our time left or even offer another drink before happy hour was over. When we were ready to leave, we requested our checks and there were four of us which meant four different checks. He returns with four different pads with our checks in them and just leaves them on the table stacked and walks away- doesn't bother to personally hand them to us or even say a word. Once we all distribute our checks on our own, place our cards in them and he takes them, he returns after swiping our cards and does the same thing of placing them on the table stacked without a thank you or any word and walks away. Pretty bad service if ya ask me. Wish I could have tried the food to see if I'd enjoy it but based off the service alone, I most likely will not be returning. Bummer..."}
{"text":"Great food. Fiesta hour deals are great. I had taco and enchilada plate. Kevin was a wonderful waiter. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food, have great service and sometimes on the weekends they have live music.  Good place to come relax and watch a game or listen to music."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for 3 years about twice per month (and sometimes more frequent) and I love the food there. Normally we get excellent service. Yesterday we had family with us from Oregon and all 7 of us went. We arrived at 4pm. (not busy at all). We sat in the bar at a booth. We ordered our food by 4:15pm. In the meantime, 4 other parties were seated nearby. One of which was a table of 6. We waited, and waited for our food. We watched 3 other tables get served first, that had ordered after us. We had already waited 45 minutes. Then the waiter came by and said they were plating our food and he said he was sorry but they cooked the smaller tables food first, he said. WHAAAAT?? NO! You don't do that!! He said they wanted ours to be served all at once. Food should be served in the order it was taken PERIOD! Then another 10 minutes had passed and still no food and he then brought out the food for the 4th party that had arrived well after our table. I then went to let the Manager know what was going on. We all got up and left, hungry. I am so disappointed in the fact we were discriminated against for some reason, that I am afraid I will not return."}
{"text":"Everytime we come here we have great service!  The food is delicious.  Kids meals are big with a lot of choices.  Happy hour margaritas are very yummy too.  Still one of our fave places as service and food is consistent!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food my husband and I had today! We both had the special. It consisted of a shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada. The refried beans melted in your mouth and the sauce on the enchilada was so delicious! The beef taco was tasty and fresh.
The service was excellent! They kept our chips and salsa bowls full and refilled our drinks when empty. Next time I am in the area, I will make it a point to come back and eat there again!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in many many years..  Pretty good... Staff was really nice. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This isn't Mexican food. 

I came here very hungry, when your really hungry food will taste better than it normally does.

This was very bland, and cheese tasted like kraft cheese from walmart.

I'm sorry but for mexican place in phoenix in arizona, this was very below average."}
{"text":"This review is based totally on the food, I haven't actually eaten in the reasturant, we've always had it delievered with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com or picked it up.  But the food is good.  It's not the best mexican food in the valley but it's yummy.  The only thing I don't like is it's not really consistant.  Some nights the food is fantastic some times it's meh ok.  I order the fajitas a lot I love them and they aren't the least healthy thing on the menu lol.  Some nights the are full and yummy some nights it seems like a lunch portion or something becaue it's half of what I usually get (which for me is enough for two meals)."}
{"text":"The food was just \"ok.\" The service very underwhelming. With the sheer number of Mexican food restaurants around the Valley, there really is never a reason to eat mediocre food with mediocre service. Normally I'm a pretty generous tipper, but due to the minimum service we received, I only tipped 13% of the bill. She got back what she put out."}
{"text":"-Food is decent, not the best Mexican food. It's about $7.75 for a 2-item combo during lunch, no rice or beans. Taco shell was dripping with grease and the meat was room temp. That's appetizing, right?

-The WORST waitress EVER!!!! We thought she was either drunk or on some sort of drugs! We tipped the bus boy instead. It was too late to ask for a different Food Server...we were stuck with her. 

-Waitress told us she was going to clear off dishes at another table and will be back to take our order, even after we were sitting there waiting already for 10 minutes and told her we WERE ready to order....we saw her chatting with another table. Who does this?

-The Busboy acted more professional than the Food Server. She was \"in-your-face\" patronizing, rather a very \"fake friendly\", and acted like someone who had been drinking, it was really uncomfortable.

-Chips and salsa were good.

-Not a good value for the price/portion.

-Hostess was friendly. 

-I would NEVER eat here again, esp since there are so many other choices for Mexican food in the Valley."}
{"text":"The service was very sweet and well-meaning, so as an experience where I sit still in an air-conditioned space and people bring me stuff, this was fine.

The stuff... not so fine. Let's get the party started with... stale chips. I am also skeptical that the sangria contained any alcohol at all. While I'm grateful to have not had a buzz on with a drive home, if I'd wanted alcohol-free fruit juice, I would have stopped at Fry's for a quart of cran-grape and paid less than the $6.50 that went with a small glass of mostly ice.

The steak fajitas consisted of a great mass of caramelized onion and seven small strips of the most gristly steak I've ever encountered. The fajita strips I buy at the supermarket are openly \"meat leftovers we can't sell otherwise,\" and they have less gristle. I seriously worried about pulling a tooth loose while trying to bite through these and had to give up on wrapping the fajita fillings in tortillas, which is kind of the gist of the fajita experience.

Or not, since only two tortillas are provided. Do not look to the guacamole for flavor; it could well be the shortening-and-green-coloring kind sold at the supermarket.

Oh, and the free wi-fi wasn't connected to the internet. Um, what's the point of wi-fi,then?

I went into Manuel's thinking \"I'll be adventurous, I'll support local business, I remember having really good food for cheapish at a Manuel's right after I moved to Phoenix.\" I left feeling that the proprietors were laughing at people like me for paying $15 an entree for food that doesn't measure up to most people's home leftovers.

That's the last time I impulsively stop at a restaurant before checking Yelp, as any number of people could have warned me."}
{"text":"OMG!  I had steak fajitas and husband had the three amigos enchiladas. Couldn't decide which plate was worse! Our meals
tasted like left overs reheated in a microwave. The \"steak\" was really cheap meat that was overcooked. Never again. Oh, and their prices are ridiculously high. We've had better food at Taco Bell !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like the ambiance at this restaurant.  However, the service is poor!  My sister & I  went in on Saturday, November 30 & it was not busy.  We ordered a couple of cokes & nachos.  It took over a 1/2 hour to get the nachos - when they were served to us it was served on a tiny plate.  I'm thinking really??  this is $9?  This is the 3rd time we've been there & had lousy service.  The woman who was at a table next to us had also ordered nachos & her plate was huge!  Not recommending!"}
{"text":"Best mexican I have had in a long time! The happy hour drink specials cant be beat! Pay attention to the heat factor or it might light you up a little to much! Great queso!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the service and food.  

If you are a fan of HOT spices, you'll want to try the roasted jalapeños.  OMG!  I pride myself in eating hot food, but this was too hot even for me."}
{"text":"my wife's family came into town from ILL. and went here it was amazing food and great service. we will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Wanted to see how their tamales compared to Macayo's and went for dinner Monday night. Got seated right away. The chips and salsa were very good. I ordered the Mix & Match with the green corn tamale, rice, and beans. My friend got the red beef tamale so we could try both. When they came out, I was disappointed to see them covered in sauce. I am so used to tamales in the husk that I didn't even think about them being served in sauce. Turns out the sauce didn't really add much to the tamales. The green corn tamale was very sweet and I liked it. The beef tamale was barely room temperature, didn't have much spice, and the masa was rather dry. Wouldn't recommend that one. But our service was good and I felt so stuffed after that meal!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite Mexican restaurant so far in west valley. We have tried several and nothing compares to this place. We now eat regularly here. Enchilada and green chili burrito are great. Carne Asada is perfect every time."}
{"text":"Extremely good Mexican food.  Good service, reasonable prices. Really good salsa.   Enchilada sauce is outstanding and beef tacos are thd best."}
{"text":"Quite pricey for the very bland food that they serve. Food did not have any flair or flavor."}
{"text":"Salsa was decent, Food average.  Not bad, but I won't stop there again.  Travelling through Phoenix on our way back to Tucson and tried to find some relatively authentic Mexican food  This worked out fine, but was nothing to get excited about.."}
{"text":"Came here one evening and we were seated right away. We came just in time to take advantage of their happy hour. Service was friendly and food was good. I didn't care for their salsa it didn't have a kick to it like I like but other than that everything was good. I wouldn't mind coming back in the future."}
{"text":"I have only been to Manuel's twice recently. I can honestly say I think that on these two visits they have the best Mexican food in the valley. Both the red and the green sauce are rich and full-flavored which made my two-item combo delicious. I had the green corn tamale with the green sauce and the shredded beef enchilada with the red sauce and both were perfect. The shredded beef was lean, tender, and flavorful. Their Spanish rice is very flavorful, and their refried beans with cheese on top are very good. One of the things I like about this restaurant is that the dishes come to the table extremely hot and steaming and very nicely finished on the salamander broiler. Actually the plates are too hot to hold here. Service was attentive and excellent also. Really loved my meals and Manuel's has become my go-to place for Mexican food in the Valley now. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner on Friday night and the place was packed. When we walked in the sitting area was full of people waiting. Since we decided to sit in the bar we were able to get a table right away. 
I am not sure if this was a good or a bad thing. Our drink order was taken fairly quickly and our chips and salsa arrived promptly. The chips were so-so and the salsa was unusual but we decided we liked it. I ordered a margarita which I did not think was very good.  It took a while for the waiter to make it back to take our order but that was nothing compared to the time it took for our food to come out. My husband ordered some type of casserole so maybe that took a little longer to cook or something but wow!  Once our food arrived I was a little disappointed to find out that my chile Rellano was wrapped in egg instead of fried but other than that it was ok. My hubby's casserole was also ok. Like the other reviewers the food is decent, not the best mexican food we have had. 
It also seemed like the more the place cleared out the better the service was. 
In all this was much better and cheaper then Arriba Grill down the road and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We will probably give it another try on a less crowded night."}
{"text":"Disappointed in margarita, it could've been stronger. Decent food, but definitely not worth the price. Tried the flan for dessert and it was very grainy. Chips and salsa were good, best part of the meal."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how bad the food was here.  Lets start with the salsa, terrible.  It tasted like some peppers and tomatoes mixed with store purchased Pace salsa.  The appetizers of Chicken Nachos where soggy from the second they hit the table.  My wife order Shrimp fajitas, that arrived just warm and not sizzling on the plate like they should be.  I ordered a Chimichanga that was so bland and dry I could only eat a quarter of it.  Even my daughter could not eat her bean and cheese burrito because she said it was so dry.

After a $71 lunch bill ??? I still cannot believe it was that much, I will NEVER go back to this place again.  How they are still in business I have no idea, as I've had a better burrito's at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Manuel's is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The chips and salsa are the best. The pico salsa is so refreshing and light. The chile salsa is spicy and flavorful. 

For an entree, I had the Pollo Especial. The chicken was tender and the sauce was creamy and savory. Everything was at the proper temperature. 

The tables and facility were clean and the staff was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"I placed an order to go at 7:30 and was told 10 minutes at 8 o'clock  after having paid my bill and being told four times it'll be a couple more minutes were waiting on the taco I left and went to Dairy Queen. The most expensive hotdog I have ever eaten"}
{"text":"3 stars???!! You'd think with such a large Hispanic population, Phoenix would have amazing Mexican restaurants,  but we have been to many, and this is the first one I thought was really REALLY good!!! Service was ok, but the salsa and all the food we ordered was fantastic! I found my Mexican restaurant for sure! I'm over-looking the sub par service we had, because every single place in this city has sub par service. Maybe people in the Pacific Northwest are just a different, kinder, gentler,  more genuine kind of people, but all of Phoenix servers are barely tolerable...thus far....Still, I'm giving you a 5 for your food and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Great food! Love the Baja Tacos! Very very good. Chips and salsa are good too. Had fried ice cream for desert."}
{"text":"A party of 10 and great service and everyone enjoyed there food. Everyone went home happy."}
