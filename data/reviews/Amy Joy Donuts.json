{"text":"I would give no stars if I could! I used to come here as a kid and it was great... Well last night I went to buy two dozen and the worker was SLEEPING!!!!!! She didn't even wake up from bell on the door!!!!! Their loss not mine!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, doughnuts are great,  but when I asked for an ice coffee, the worker gave me hot coffee , with two ice cubes in it.. Idk that's just tacky and not an ice coffee due to it was still HOT!"}
{"text":"There are two reasons to go to Amy Joy Donuts: to get donuts, or to go to Amy Joy's. This review is much more about the latter than the former. To address the donuts portion, let me say that I enjoy their donuts. Vanilla powdered, cream filled donuts are delicious; their cherry cake donuts are tasty; and their peculiar flavors (e.g. sour cream, maple) usually end up being pleasant surprises. I never really much got into their coffee, and I can't speak for their bagels. In a One on One, I'd put Amy Joy over Dunkin, give Krispy Kreme the glazed donut edge and nothing more, and give Amy Joy a hands-down victory over the pre-packaged stuff you can buy in stores. I have no experience with Biagio's or any other donut shop not mentioned, so I cannot speak to them. As is to be expected, they are best when fresh, usually reaching their flavor half-life after about 30 hours.

Now, if you're like me, you don't go to Amy Joy to pick up some donuts to bring into work. You go there because it's open 24/7 and you and your friends all need a late-night break from work. So you go there with your friends, you order a dozen or two donuts, and you sit around working on stuff or playing cards. And, while you curse the terrible hand you were dealt or the derivation of Virial theorem from entropy, you grab a donut from the box. Inside its sugary embrace you find happiness. At the sleepy corner of Mayfield and Richmond, across the street from the tranquil glow of the CVS sign, you are temporarily released from your troubles.

That's the real charm of Amy Joy. When the sun rises, I'm sure it becomes a regular donut shop, but underneath the night sky, it's a restful, happy place. Now, fortune conspired against me in this area, as my one friend with whom I would share these trips was diagnosed with Celiac disease (gluten = bad), and another friend entered a relationship with a girl who also has Celiac disease, so we started spending our time at less happy, less gluten-y places. Prior to that cruel fate, we would frequent this store.

Now, in my many experiences there, I've found the workers to be nice people. One person in particular, who I won't name to protect her privacy, used to always come sit with us when there weren't any customers and the donuts were baking on their own in the back. She was good company, and some of our conversations with her have a special place amongst my friends. 

So what I'm saying is that if you're looking to get donuts for your friends, family, or co-workers, it doesn't really matter where you go. Donuts are more or less the same wherever. However, if you're looking for something to do late at night, Amy Joy's droll exterior hides a world of charm. As I move on from Cleveland, it will be one of the locations I miss the most."}
{"text":"The older woman that served me couldn't have been ruder, she yelled at me, rolled her eyes and slammed the window for no good reason. Will not be returning, I'll give my money to Dunkin Donuts for the simple fact that none of their employees have ever treated me the way this woman did. If you don't like people, you probably shouldn't work in customer service!"}
{"text":"Just had the coffee....blecch.  Some Dunkin' Donuts knockoffs have just-as-good (if not better) coffee; sorry to say Amy Joy does not. Donuts looked alright.  Next time I'll try one.

The woman behind the counter was really nice, in that sort of mellow, \"I'm takin' my time 'cause I'm happy to be alive\" kinda way.  So yeah, the service was a bit slow.  It didn't really bother me that much."}
{"text":"The donuts are pretty bad, the glazed donuts don't have any glaze on them. I definitely won't be back and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is another throwback place for me. It's been around for at least 35 years. I have such fond memories of being barely tall enough to see the doughnuts when I was a little girl!  I love the doughnuts and the memories."}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad rap.  Maybe not a full on 4 star, but not less than a 3.  I will say the lady behind the counter could learn to mellow out a bit, but she was not too over the top aggressive in getting our order.  The place on the inside is well maintained and clean.  They have a pretty good selection of donuts and specialty items. 

So the donuts themselves.  There is no comparison to DD.  DD is terrible all the way around from a donut perspective.  I will admit the plain glazed is not that good. But the rest of the stuff they had was really good and worth the stop.  Especially their honey dew (cake glazed)."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours with great and friendly customer service. The donuts are always on point, they are more fresh and better tasting than any Dunkin' Donuts or chain donut spot. A great go to spot when having late night munchies."}
{"text":"I give them this many stars because their cake doughnuts are amazing along with the cherry ones but service super slow!! Also don't pull up to the drive through window and not have an idea of what you want..all hell breaks loose and than they become really rude..not sure about the coffee never had it.."}
{"text":"Great donuts horrible coffee.  Heading to Dunkin! Drive thru is great option but if coffee is bad who will drive thru??? Just pulled into Dunkin and the drive thru line is full.  I love Amy Joy as its a neighborhood favorite!  Sad to see them not update there coffee pots!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Possibly the worst experience ever. And face it if you look at my other reviews you will see I love my sweets... But this was bad! I should have known from the lack of customers and lack of items BR I thought perhaps that they had just sold out... 
I explained it was our first visit, asked the lady what she recommended to which she replied \"the glazed by I'm out.\" And never suggested anything else. 
I chose a chocolate long john, my sister chose a vanilla filled and my daughter chose a sprinkles covers one. No lie I took two bites. It was like it was day old and hard on the outside and be inside tasted like crisco and cheap vanilla. I spit out the second bite. It was that nasty.  Chara ate a bye of her vanilla cream and did the same. She even had to wipe her tongue to try and get away from the slimy feel.  I tasted it and am sorry I did. And then Rhyan tried hers and said it was stale too.
Glad it was less than 4 dollars. It was a total waste. Will not try this again."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Amy Joy donuts and I really like them! They're fresh made om premises and I think that's fab. The place is basic, and I get my donuts to go for work. I am not looking for ambiance, I am looking for a place with great donuts. This hits the mark. If you want to grab some coffee or ice cream you can, and the seating is pretty drab, but it's a basic donut joint...with great donuts. The cream filled ones are a fave. Light and fluffy and all that a sinful donut should be!!"}
{"text":"This place would get a better rating if the lady with short hair who works in the afternoon was friendlier. I've been here 4 times week, two times her and two times another employee. And the short haired lady  is extremely rude, short and brash... God forbid you ask a question about a donut. 
Reason why I was here so much this week is because I promised my son a donut each day of the week for something good he did last weekend. After this week is over I am not coming back! 
Such a turn off!!!"}
{"text":"These are the best donuts in the world! I wish Amy Joy was everywhere. My favorite kind is the sour cream & chocolate with sprinkles. Make sure you try them out! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I literally can't think of anything better than an Amy Joy Apple Fritter.  Their products are amazing.  Seriously, stop into Amy Joy Donuts and you'll understand"}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. Lady behind the counter didn't seem like she really cared about the place, because she was just leaning up against the counter when I walked in. I called beforehand to see if they made their apple fritters with real apples and she reassured me that they did. I may have seen 3-5 mini chunks of apple in the entire fritter. Needless to say, I'll be sticking to my Spudnuts and Patterson Farms fritters!!!"}
{"text":"This donut shop is a solid 3.5 in my book, but I'm giving it 4 because the staff are always so helpful and they have a drive thru! The cake donuts tend to stay good for a few days, which is a nice plus.  One been coming here since I was in college in 2004 and although the location has since changed, the quality of the product, 24 hr service, and consistently nice employees has not. Plus, they put out some really great coupons in the local mailers!"}
{"text":"The best service and So amazing! Best donuts on the planet.  Don't walk   RUN!!  Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is a shadow of its former self.  Growing up I remember them having fresh consistently good donuts in many more varieties than they offer now.  I recently went in to get a dozen because I had a groupon to use up.  The donuts are about half the size of other places, contain barely any filling, and were not exactly fresh even though I went in at about 7 am. The coffee was terrible too very generic and watered down tasting. Service was adequate nothing really to complain about there.  I would much rather make the drive out to Patterson's or Biagios next time I need a donut fix.  Sadly even Dunkin' is better than this place now."}
{"text":"I frequent this donut shop because it's on the way to work and I often pick up a dozen for my co workers. The staff here is very nice and attentive but unfortunately the donuts just aren't that good. I don't know if it's just this location or Amy Joy in general."}
{"text":"My Amy Joy experience is just weird.  A colleague at work brings in their apple fritters every few months, and they're great.  

I had to entertain some vendors recently and brought in Amy Joy for breakfast.  The fritters were predictably great, and the glazed croissants were also awesome - buttery and sweet and wonderful.

And even the woman filling my donut order was at first charming in a crazy old donut lady way, but the charm went away quickly, being replaced with a weirdness that bordered on offensive.

I asked (this was toward the end of September) if they had any pumpkin products yet, and she said that they did not.  I mentioned that I lived just around the corner from a Dunkin and that they had them, and I laughed and acknowledged the fact that I had brought up a competitor (and worse yet, a chain).  She joked that I was going to get the smallest apple fritters they had, now, and we exchanged laughs.  Then she just started slamming Dunkin.  I made some comment about how their donuts were mediocre, but that their bagels were very good, and she said, \"I hear their muffins are good, too.\"

I said that they were generally very good, but that once, they accidentally topped the blueberry muffins in kosher salt instead of sugar.

\"Must be some Christian thing\" she said.  Huh?  At this point, I was just ready to get going, so I smiled and nodded.  She continued, \"They're a bunch of Christians over there running that place, you know it?\"

Despite being a Christian, I was not personally offended.  It was more of a Twilight Zone moment than anything.  But I mean, really... I look as WASPy as they come.  What was she thinking?  

Oh well... the donuts were good!"}
{"text":"First, it's Cleveland.   Second, it's a donut shop. I don't think Zagat will need to trek out here anytime soon.  The expectations shouldn't be so high. 
I walk in, as another \"must go\" place when I go to Cleveland. I love these donuts. I love the vanilla creme long johns.  I love that when I walk in at the same time a decade later the same old farts are sitting discussing the same thing as they did for the last 3650 days prior. Smells like a fresh donut shop. Not like a bagel shop or coffee shop.  They are open til 11 at night. Went 3 times when I was in town.  Glazed donuts are great."}
{"text":"Pretty good... although I have to say, some of the filled donuts taste a whole lot like Dunkin Donuts (which is fine, since I like Dunkin Donuts too).  The butter crunch is unique, and has a very soft cake donut covered with a crunchy outer layer.  If you go on their website, there's a coupon for $1 off a dozen donuts.  A dozen donuts from here is about $7.50 (around $6.50 if you have the coupon)."}
{"text":"Lady serving us was rude.  Second time here and they always act like they're doing you a favor by taking your cash and handing you a piece of mediocre friend dough.  Donuts aren't that great.  Dunkin' is much better.  The coffee served here is like office coffee...and it sits on a burner cooking for who knows how long.  Store is dingy and unappealing.  No effort is made here for pretty much anything.  Just a very unhappy staff :("}
{"text":"A coworker of mine used to bring in Amy Joy's every day until we finally made him stop.  He has since switched to Biagio's.  The donuts are just nothing mind blowing but do the trick when it comes to a standard coffee dunking donut.  The people that work there are nice, the place is clean, but the food leaves me wondering how hard is it to mess up a donut.

I still have donut dreams of being at Krispy Kreme and getting a donut right off the line after the glazing.  Does it get any better then that?"}
{"text":"Here over Thanksgiving visiting family. Grew up in the area and always loved Amy Joy Donuts. Stopped on our way out of town... what a mistake.  The woman who took care of us was rude, seemed annoyed we interrupted her conversation with the other person working there. The donuts were stale and tasteless and the coffee was horrible.  Definitely,  not what they used to be.  Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"OK so I don't exactly know what the butter nut donut is (and neither did the girl at the counter lol) but it and the powdered donut I had were pretty good. They were about half the size of donuts you usually get, but tasted fresh. Washed down with a big glass of milk.

The shop, itself, left a lot to be desired. Dirty as hell floor and a too bright, uninviting dining area. Amy Joy's is 24 hours and seemingly the only donut shop in all of Cleveland that is so. The customer service, like the reviews on Yelp state, needs improvement. No one was at the counter when we walked in and when the girl did come out, she was less than friendly. She didn't encourage us to stay, in fact she seemed to be trying to hustle us out as quickly as possible. She had some kind of drama going on in the back, it seemed, possibly with a gentleman I caught a glimpse of. Shrug. She didn't know what donut I was eating and didn't care, she just wanted to take care of us quickly and return to the back. I commented and how the boxes were cute and she kinda rolled her eyes at me. This woman should not be in customer service. Lol."}
{"text":"Good donuts, great service! 

I came here with a big group. A woman came over to Mr. HERO'S while we ate saying she had donuts for 25 cents.  We all went in and bought a bunch! She have us deals on everything. I got a Boston creme. It wasn't exactly fresh but very good. Not greasy like donuts from Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts. There was a guy working at the tables too so they might have Wi-Fi. 

I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"So I just got home from this store. I had a terrible experience there just now. I don't know that woman's name. She wears glasses. Shoulder length hair. Skinny. She took our order. She was not happy at first. When we asked how many more donuts to fill our dozen order. She did not even look at us just angrily faced the box to us. Her inside voice must be count yourself!! Later I showed her the 1 dollar off coupon from Amy joy's website. She had problem redeeming it or maybe she just did not want to give us the discount. She was like you know what I am not going to give you 1 dollar off if you don't tell me how to redeem it. Seriously? You gave that attitude to your customers? Could you just ask for it nicely? Later, she took away my phone to the back office. Finally she came out with a happy face telling me my coupon was expired. Ok she got me back eventually. I don't care about that 1 dollar coupon. But her disgusting attitude will make me no desire to go back there or to let her serve me next time. People like her should not work any more as customer service. By the way, Amy Donuts take off the expired coupons from your website!! That woman definitely ruined my Saturday!!!"}
