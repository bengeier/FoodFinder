{"text":"I really like this place! Great atmosphere, quite spacious and decent music everyone can agree upon. The food was excellent, service ok but not horrible. Definetly not impressed with the gaming, up and down. Eventually lost $20 (im not a big gambler!) So if your looking for great food in a bar setting give them a try!! I would go back there again for sure, probably my new neighborhood bar!!"}
{"text":"Great place to relax for those of us who worked in North Las Vegas.  Pool tables, and great service, plus the fireside couches."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the bartender Gina!!! Ask her about her pet raccoon and hamster! The food here is amazing! Definitely recommend coming here. Ask for Gina! She will take care of you.. Also, TIP YOUR EFFING BARTENDERS! seriously, it's messed up if you don't. Okay that's all."}
{"text":"Went in at 1:00am craving for breakfast. Didn't know what to expect. Went to the bar and took a seat. Seemed like a nice and clean place. Bartender was nice and friendly. Small talk and looked at the menu. I asked about the Morning After hamburger and he said it was delicious. I ordered it along with a coke. People around the bar were young, eating and just hanging out. When I got my burger, it was incredible. The fried egg on my burger was cooked just right. I bit into it and the yoke broke. Oh my God!! It was one of the best burgers I've had in so long, but the French fries just took it over the top. It was an awesome meal. I will be back because the guy behind the bar was telling me about how good their gravy is for their chicken fried steak or the biscuits and gravy. I can't wait."}
{"text":"Lol. Don't waste for time. Stupid waitresses and staff that does not understand the gaming concept. 7 minutes of my life gone."}
{"text":"Absolute Worst service. Bar manager a total douche Played $20 won $80 played it down had 3 beers  Charged me for 2 WTF Losers  Always horrible service and some loser balding manager that obviously got taken to the tool shed with Daddy too many times And the chicks behind the bar aren't much to look at either, just bad lame service. AVOID!!!!! Pathetic Guess my review is not recommended Strange maybe truth hurts Yelp too"}
{"text":"Such an awesome fun filled place the food is amazing and the bartenders are awesome great drink and food specials !!!! Free pool is a plus !!!!!"}
{"text":"Tipped good thinking next time we would actually get some service, turns out the bartenders actually just a dick and didn't acknowledge our group  what so ever. Ill never go there again , worth the drive to go to the grand teton location.  They are good ppl up there with way better service."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I don't know what it was like a few years ago but I thoroughly enjoy coming now.  Fast friendly staff. Amazing food. Great prices."}
{"text":"Best bartenders ever!!!  Chad Amanda Kara dream team Saturday nights !!!!!!  Hell ya. Fun times. Come have a drink with them."}
{"text":"Terrible service . Love when the bartenders are drinking more than you. Not to mention harass you about playing the machines"}
{"text":"Chris the graveyard bartender is great. Place is clean, food is good and machines play a bit ?"}
{"text":"What a great place to hang out after being in the sun all day. I ordered the Ceasar salad and let me say it was the best salad I had so far. My friend ordered the taco salad and let me tell you I am going to order that next time. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"If I could rate them zero stars I would- the bartenders are complete bitches. We were ignored  for about 15 with empty glasses in front of us yet when a large group of they're friends walked in they had drinks within a minute. What a joke. This was the 2nd time we had been in, the first time was just the same but I figured maybe they were having an off night, decided to give them another try. Big mistake. My boyfriend only got good service when he went there without me. Nice huh ? I wanted to leave without paying for our drinks , but couldn't stoop to that level. Will NEVER step foot in this bar again until they fire those bartenders. Which is sad since we live across the street and it would be nice to have a good hangout so close."}
{"text":"Boooo.  I was gambling and only comped two drinks.  Service was slow.  Over all it gets a meh?"}
{"text":"After years of living near this place and commenting how we should try it we came in here for lunch.  Wow what a mistake.  I guess the place was understaffed.  Totally understandable, however that doesn't mean you have to be curt and rude to your customers.   Can't say anything bad about the food, but usually if there's bad service, expect the same from the back of the house as well as there is no accountability here for bad service!  We got up and left.  No reason for bad service.  You are in hospitality, if you don't like your job, quit!"}
{"text":"It's hit or miss here, but mostly hit!  The food is above average, drink select above average, vibe is average, so 4 stars is just about right!"}
{"text":"Met up with GA for some chow and quick chat to catch up.  After meeting up in the immediate area, this was the place settled on to talk and eat.  If memory serves many a year ago, I stopped in here for some beers after working the grave yard shift.  I recalled it being as pleasant an experience as one would expect after watching the sunset and rise again.  Fast forward......With the day already in full swing and other dining plans not working out.  The Lodge at Tenaya  seemed a chill place to meet up.  On a Monday afternoon, it was indeed....chill.  Burgers and beer for me, and attentive hostess....everything was good to go.  This will absolutely be a rally point in in the future."}
{"text":"If the bartenders spent as much time taking care of customers as they spend on the cell phones. I would have probably left more than 1 star.  I've gone through this more than one time with this place. I'm done. Will not ever come back."}
{"text":"Now, I used to come here specifically for drinking but a friend of mine wanted to meet for lunch.   I was training for a spartan race at the time so my diet was fairly strict so I ordered the salmon. When the food arrived I'm not so sure how that was even served to me. Not only was it more than small it had the texture of jerky and was terrible. I ended up just eating the vegetables and sending it back. Now with that being said I will never eat here again.   Onto the service, it was the middle of the day with maybe 5 people in the bar and it took my friend a good 45 minutes to get a refill. Not only did she never acknowledge that the glass was empty she was never around to grab her attention for a refill. On top of all that she forgot to grab the beer the first time we had asked for a refill.   I will still come for drinks but it's nothing to brag about it here."}
{"text":"I love this place! The atmosphere is great and so comfortable. The food is delicious and the bartender named Sabrina was so fun and had a great attitude. Love her! I really enjoy spending time here."}
{"text":"I had my promotion party at the Lodge last night and was very pleased with the level of service from Jill (bartender), Rachel (server), and Ray (general manager). They were helpful, friendly, and attentive! We probably had around 60 to 70 guests there for several hours. It was a perfect night! Thank you to the staff at the Lodge at Tenaya...until next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best wings ever! And now, best service! Every time I come in, I'm greeted with a hello, no matter how busy! Excellent, EXCELLENT customer service. Appears to be under new management, which is a huge step in the right direction...new GM is incredible! All the new bartenders are great!   Why only  stars? I hear the company is hard to work for. Why can't they invest in this wonderful property to reestablish it?  I've heard one too many times from previous employees, and employees/guests at neighboring taverns, that \"nothing ever changes there\". I'm a local, and in the industry. I come in for the wings, the bartenders (now), and it's close to my house. But when I want a crowd, or live music, I go elsewhere. And as a heavy gambler, I'd spend much more, but there are NO incentives or promos...gimme a drawing or a card of the day or SOMETHING, y'all!  I hope this new management is given the opportunity to reestablish this awesome joint. What are you going to do to keep me from going down the street?   But... GREAT wings!"}
{"text":"BEST food and service... awesome place to grab the BEST salmon and absolutey best service EVER!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming here at all hours of the day and night for the past three years.. All the bartenders are super nice. Service can be a little slow sometimes but that's because they treat everybody like family. I love coming here I always feel welcome, it's clean, the bartenders make sure to kick out the weirdos... Just a great place to hang out"}
{"text":"Prices to high!! I used to come here all the time, bartender Lisa is great, but the prices are outrageous, fuck the lodge, never coming back"}
{"text":"Message to the ownership and management. Making customers happy should be your #1 priority. This place is run like our government, poor decision after poor decision, raising prices (like they raise taxes) instead of lowering them to get more people in the door.  When your only focus is only your gaming revenue (and very few machines anyway), you should not be in this business (and that is likely going to take care of itself anyway). You should be happy for your customers when they win so they come back, not slow serve them drinks and be pissed that they won.  Very short sited business plan. Very close to my house and NEVER coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I'll never come here specifically because my car was completely blocked off and I waited 20 minutes to leave when the delivery driver showed up."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, do not ask to substitute a pancake for the biscuit when you order the chicken fried steak. I did, and it seemed to put the waitress into high-speed wobble's. At first she said they couldn't do it, then she said they could but there would be an up charge. I agreed to the up charge and then she asked me if I still wanted the biscuit. I said \"sure\" at which point she said they really couldn't do it because the pancake would have to go under the meat. What??? Apparently this is the first somebody has asked for a substitution.  The chicken fried steak itself was about middle of the road compared to others that I've had. The eggs and the fried potatoes were on par, but I was a little put off by the biscuit and gravy underneath the CFS. I ordered iced tea to drink. The waitress never came back to offer a refill. The layout was the same as the other Lodge location I have been to, whereas the dining area is surrounded by glass looking into the bar area.   It was an OK experience, but with so many other places in the area I don't think I would make a special trip to go back."}
{"text":"Probably the worst experience of 2017.... came in For lunch at 12:30... didn't get food until 1:20...only 4 people in the dining room... bartender was a mess and has no idea of customer service... the only saving grace is the food tasted great..... seriously you need to take this place off your vista schedule.... owner needs to redo the front staff.. they are driving business away... I have spent my last dollar there.... you should too.... with so many choices in Las Vegas... this is not one....."}
{"text":"We've gone here a handful of times recently and Kerry & Kahana are wonderful, always welcoming as soon as we walk in. Tonight, we had the steak quesadilla, tater tot nachos (the aioli was delicious!) & sliders. The food was so good! Will definitely be back for more date nights!"}
{"text":"The food is actually quite good all around for typical bar food. I wouldn't hesitate to order if you are there and happen to get hungry."}
{"text":"We wanted to try somewhere new for breakfast. This was our first time here. The place was fairly empty but beautiful inside. We were greeted by Holly,  the bartender, and pulled up two barstools to play while we ate. She made two awesome Bloody Mary's using Clamato with a bit of spice. Damn respectable. She offered them as talls and of course we had to oblige. For breakfast, the wife ordered steak and eggs; and I ordered chicken fried chicken from Holly's suggestion.  The wife's steak was not good. The meat seemed old and even smelled a little strange. My breakfast was really good with great tasting gravy on the chicken and biscuit. The house potatoes were crispy and well seasoned wit no grease.  Holly apologized for the bad steak and offered something else, but the wife just enjoyed the rest of her breakfast which was all good.  Once done, we asked for the check and was surprised to see that we got charged for everything except the streak and eggs. Holly even charged us $10 for each Bloody Mary. We were surprised because we played the machines while eating and each dropped $100. Seriously? No comps for anything outside of the bad steak?  While we liked Holly and the vibe there, we probably would not return knowing that they don't comp players."}
{"text":"Went to shoot pool and was never offered a drink.  Went up to the bar the bartender in the black hat ask what do you  want very ruid  I told her a wine she said I will get you that but will send over the waitress. The waitress came one time.  We went to gamble was never ask if we wanted a refill. Went back to our seats waited for the waitress for  about 20 minutes she was on her phone the whole time.  The two bartender as well taking pictures only catering to the men.  Very disappointed. Will Never come back in.  To bad because this bar is cute and can do so much better.  :("}
{"text":"I had the $12.99 TALL & CHEESEY BURGER.  1Lb Burger, meat is great tasting, not a big fan of the 3 Texas Toast bread slices on it or the herd fried onions.  I will take a couple buddies here when they visit but I will get just a regular bun.  Went at about 11:30AM, it was dead in there.  Waitress said it picks up at 2:00PM."}
{"text":"Great place, wish more people would catch on. I have yet to get anything bad from the menu. Great atmosphere, kozy surroundings, seperate family dining area."}
{"text":"Our Bartender Karey (may have the spelling wrong) was amazing! This was my first time here and I will definitely be back! Food was great, drink were prompt and great.So happy to have found this place! Thank you all!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the other reviews before going in.  I may have chosen to go somewhere else.  Clearly, good customer services is NOT a priority.  The food was okay but a bit overpriced, the beers were cold but the service was slow.  $25 of play at full tilt didn't warrant a single comp.  When I asked the bartender how much you had to play to receive a comp, she said $30. Since that is higher than ANY other place I have been to in town, it might have been good information to give me.   I know that $25 is not a lot of play but I was never enticed to play more.  The bartender never asked if I was/wanted to be a member of the players club and never told us about any promos etc.   Also, it took about 10 minutes to get our change because the bartender was more concerned with the payout to the GM who was drinking at the bar.  It is unfortunate because this place has a lot of potential and is close to my home but I won't be back.  I am not sure how they stay in business since there were a total of 10 people at the bar from 9-11 PM on a Friday night and it is clear that they are not welcoming new customers."}
{"text":"I love it here. Food is great, bartenders are fun, I feel like I'm at a party in a log cabin! Pool tables, video poker, and fast service on the food we ordered. Such a great gem!!"}
{"text":"The  food was good as always we ordered the tatter tot nachos, wings, country fried chicken, turkey burger, pancakes and a veggie omelet. Everything was delicious except the omelet it was alright. The waitress was nice but kept forgetting things and took a very long time to get to us. Maybe it was just too much going on. I also think the sign that says seat yourself  should be bigger and brighter."}
{"text":"We always go to this location for a relaxed atmosphere to get something to eat and play a few games of pool. Their food is pretty good (recommend their burgers and quesadilla) and the service is usually pretty on point."}
{"text":"Great food. Great beer. Great environment. That asian bartender though....gorgeous and super nice. Everyone there was very friendly and attentive. I've never had a bad time here..even when they were super busy. This has become our chill spot."}
{"text":"This bar is fabulous, the staff is awesome, chad and Kara are the greatest=]. Definitely a place to check out whether you are a local or tourist!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to unwind... such great staff and attentive bartenders... every shift every day... especially Chris, Dan, Tony, and Gina... they re always welcoming and fun... Great place to watch the games"}
{"text":"One thing about this place is consistency!   Consistently Horrible!   Lack of customer service is unbelievable!  Being in the business it's no wonder why that place is empty.  Played machines and still charge you for shots.  I could go to the strip for that and have better atmosphere.  They cater to their friends while leave paying customers ignored.  I used to meet friends there but won't go in there EVER!   The bartenders are weak and not in the least friendly.  Went in for Mon nite football.  The place is like a funeral hm.  Bad atmosphere, empty  and you leave like an intruder.  No thanks.  Go to Grand Teton if u want a good Lodge.  WAY friendlier there and better service."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill.  Their happy hour specials are higher than other bars regular prices.  $5 a beer is a special?  I bought a salad that was not very good. Not very many gaming machines and the place was empty.  Don't waste your time here.  Poor management or owners must have taken this place over."}
{"text":"Thought we would try The Lodge at Tenaya and wanted to use a coupon from the entertainment book which we were promptly informed by the server that they don't accept anymore.  So...okay no problem at that point.  The server brought us lunch menus instead of breakfast then could not rustle up enough breakfast menus for three people.  She then decided to ignore us even though we were clearly ready to order. We got up and left and went somewhere else after about 15 minutes waiting. This is a nice looking place but I hope management looks at their staff for improvement."}
{"text":"Man what happened? My first review was reflective of the attentive staff and great service.  Fast forward to tonight.....my wife and I walk in and sit at the bar.....the big tattooed bearded bartender says he will be with us in just a second. Well about 12minutes later we walk out with my hundy$$$ in my hand! We watched the asian bartender chick circle twice without even looking at us while Mr BuffTatoo is on the other side. All the while I am logged in to gamble only to walk out as Mr and Mrs Invisible ....hello BJ's Brewery. BTW....how dare BJ'S interrupt my rant with prompt service!!"}
{"text":"Cool spot for bar fun, good food & drinks.Lisa Marie rocks the bar on wens. & Fri.great bartender,good times,pool tables,lots of TVs, and a great surrounding on the northwest side of town."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Bartenders on their phone while I waited for 10 minutes. Carpet made the place stinky.  Waitress was nice but didn't help my experience and won't recommend this place to fellow bartenders"}
{"text":"Not as busy as it used to be. Great service, great prices, probably one the the better places for bar food. ALSO JAMESON IS ON TAP"}
{"text":"Horrible service. In the machine $80 and oh we don't have any clean glasses and they want to charge me for a drink while I'm gambling!! All of the sudden?? First drink was free and I tip well. Looks like no take home food from here I would rather go the McDonald's then give this place any more of my money.. Horrible service absolutely"}
{"text":"The food was okay, however the service was very poor.  The waitress acted as if she was doing us a favor for her being there.  Had to ask for ketchup  and mustard  when it should have been brought out with the meal.  Soup with no crackers?  The staff should be trained or replaced."}
