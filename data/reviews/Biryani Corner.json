{"text":"Owner was no respect what you ask for,he'll make whatever he wants to.3 times in a row he gave us chicken biriyani without no meat( some chicken bones with shredded chicken).this place used to be good but i guess owner is not interested into quilty food anymore."}
{"text":"FABULOUS HOLE IN THE WALL! (takeout)  Ok - I've only had the chicken biryani and kabobs - and I don't need to try anything else, it's soooo good!  Always get absolutely stuffed for $6 (sometimes it feels a little light on the chicken, but the overall portion is mammoth), you get a large sized to go container stuffed with some of the most flavorful rice you've ever had.  Oh, and if you want some random Pakistani or Jamaican DVD's (or a random ceremonial drum?) they've got you covered for that too :p  It's a total hole in the wall, you definitely won't be eating in but you can't stop going back. The old man who runs the place is very nice and worth chatting too more than just placing your order :)   Payment Alert: Cash or Debit (extra $.25)"}
{"text":"Fantastic take out food. The older man was very friendly. Made us very delicious food. Everything was amazing, fresh, full of flavour. Just the perfect balance of spices. Will order from him again."}
{"text":"Asked for extra spicy Biryani it's was so plain and no flavour, just boiled rice with 2 chicken piece"}
{"text":"Even after telling owner I was a vegetarian, this disrespectful man proceeded to give me a vegetable biryani with chicken pieces in it. Had to throw the whole dish out. Don't you respect people who don't eat meat?"}
