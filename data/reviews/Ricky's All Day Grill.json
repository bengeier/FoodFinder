{"text":"The only convenient thing was the location, parking was okay. The menu was just average, prices seemed reasonable but had to wait too long to order and be seated and have the plates cleared they weren't busy the service staff were just disorganized. It seemed the only time we had the wait staffs attention was when the were constantly running around with the coffee, I would take one sip out and they topped it up and didn't even ask if I wanted more. Been there done that."}
{"text":"I guess Ricky's is one of those chains that tries to have decent food (and all I am commenting on is breakfast because that is all I have ever come in for - yes, I admit pre-Yelp visits) with a menu that Chef Ramsey would cringe at. As my other half stated: \"A menu this large cannot be fresh. Has to be off the Sysco wagon.\"

We both had BC Eggs Benny and the meal as a whole was ok. And I mean just okay. No attempt at presentation. The chicken tenders and waffles was even less appetizing (my daughter ordered this). I am not going to dissect the meal, but it seemed like it was made with a very low \"give a crap\" factor. I don't think a competitor such as Denny's loses any sleep over what is happening at Ricky's.

The thing that killed me was how the server came to take our drink order and basically shoved forks, knives, and napkins to the middle of the table. I am not sure if this is lazy, but I sure hate someone touching my cutlery like that where I can see it! Why not a roll-up or a proper place setting? As it was my knife had dishwasher-baked-on food. Yuck.

Anyway, wasting a lot of words on a mediocre experience. Dine at your own risk."}
{"text":"New modern restaurant, food was served hot fast and tasted great.   Went there with our three kids, two of which ordered from the kids menu.   

The kids cheese macaroni is a very small portion size and not recommended.  The kids lasagna was a decent size but seemed to lack any meat in it.  Our oldest had the chicken and waffles, order size was more than enough and was delicious.  My wife had the Greek wrap and fries which tasted fine enough but lacked some tzatziki and was wrapped a little loose and made it slightly messy.  I had the mega mushroom omelette which was plenty big enough and paired with the shredded hash browns was perfect.   

Overall nothing here to stop you from coming, but like most restaurants, there are always some little things you wish could have been better!"}
{"text":"First time here......ribs were actually good great flavor and cooked perfectly. We also had the prime rib roast? Not actually sure what that was but it's no way a roasted piece of beef. Looked and tasted like prison meal if you were the worst inmate .....ever! Can't believe it even left the kitchen. The only reason for two stars was the waitress was good and the chocolate chimichanga was amazing"}
{"text":"Have heard things have gone down in the last few months, but didn't find it that bad. Hubby has a side salad with his burger, warning if your allergic to spinach avoid the side salad, I am allergic but hubby is not. I had half rack of ribs and blackened chicken, with side of veggies, and sweet potato fries with the usual dip. Food servings was good, service was good. Its a family restaurant and nothing wrong with it, but our kids a grown and gone and sometimes it's nicer to go to a place that doesn't have kids. However this was hubby's choice so I smiled and let him choose."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food very much, but I have to say (at this particular Ricky's) the service was exceptional as the coffee was served immediately and the continual coffee and water was always there for us. The waitress and service was very attentive and quite pleasant.  High quality staff, learned how to offer professional service with quality.
Thank you"}
{"text":"Sunday's here are always extremely busy. We came in and luckily only had 3 groups in front of us in line. The entire time we were standing there waiting, there was 2-3 empty tables, both clean and dirty, yet there would be four tweens standing around the till. It took about 15 minutes before we were seated. The beginning of the service was slow, but once we ordered our food came very fast. I had a brisket eggs benedict that was delicious. While we were eating, we saw more tables open up that were being filled. By the time we were ready to go, there were 5 empty tables, and about 6-7 groups at the door waiting. Once we were done eating, it took forever to get our bill and pay, so we ended up just going to the till."}
{"text":"greasy food, slow service!
scrambles eggs were raw, sausages were  cold, toast was soaked with butter. never sent food back in my life but had to be done.  the watress voided the order with no problem. other location were much better. 
went across the street to red lobster for lunch."}
{"text":"Every weekend for the last six months I have been in and ordered the same food for takeout. Lately the quality of the food has been slipping a bit and the service even more so. Get the food \"home\" and find it is missing utensils or condiments or something. 

Today, I prepaid after it was ordered specifically asking for utensils and condiments, and gave the waitress a 15% tip. When I got the food the food boxes are thrown in a bag all askew, and when I got the food \"home\", found the condiments and utensils but no toast... 

Then when we phoned to report the missing food, and the generally slipping service the same waitress who took the order (there was no manager available) got all defensive and said we can't all be perfect all the time, and we are so busy (they weren't when I was in), and we should lower our expectations.... So rude! Clearly doesn't belong in the service industry. And if you expect to get the food that you order then maybe your expectations are too high. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Mediocre overpriced breakfast, wasn't anything to brag about. Came here because it's close to home but won't be coming back anytime soon. Definitely a disappointment. Don't bother wasting your time or money."}
{"text":"Typical chain,ok food but horrible service. Waited 15 min after being seated for waitress, only refilled coffee after I was finished meal.
The one in Dearfoot medows is much better."}
{"text":"Good basic comfort food. Nice atmoshere, clean restaurant and friendly staff.  Service is a little slow at time - but all in all a good place to go."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast.  Always order the stuffed shredded hashbrowns with my chorizo beni.  I always order my chorizo beni on special corn bread.  Taste greaaat!"}
{"text":"Treat their staff like crap, any little mistake is treated like a major event right in front of customers, food is constantly messed up, a mistake by kitchen not servers but servers are belittled by it...I will never go here again!  Learn to treat your staff right!"}
{"text":"Poor service and their pasta alfredo's don't have taste but their rib eye steak sandwich is really good."}
{"text":"Not very good this time. Had calamari for a starter, was not cooked very well at all, rubbery, but thank goodness not so bad that it had to be chewed endlessly. Had the homestyle turkey dinner. Very unimpressed. I swear the turkey was packaged, frozen, and reheated in a microwave. But what was inedible was the mashed potatoes :P Blech! They had obviously gone bad. When I pointed this out, we got a total of 10% off our bill, even though both our meals came with these nasty potatoes."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant in own building.  New & spacious with fireplace.  Friendly and courteous staff.  Standard Ricky's menu.  Good service.  Can't go wrong stopping here on your way to or from the South Health Campus.  Coffees and soft drinks were refilled. Lots of booths."}
{"text":"1. We went into the diner and immediately received attitude from the waitress when my grandmother asked for a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Waitress was curt IMMEDIATELY.
2. My grandmother said the coffee tasted old. VERY VERY VERY politely asked for a fresh cup. At this point the waitress, I kid you not, no exaggerations, started SCREAMING and CHASTISING my grandmother for asking for a fresh pot. As my grandmother is a regular there, apparently she asks for this every time. I understand this could be frustrating for a server to always have to get a fresh cup, but we were 1 of 2 tables in the establishment, and really- how hard is it to get a new cup of coffee? I don't care if she asks every time to scream at a customer, and chastise anyone, let alone an 80 year old woman that can barely walk is abhorrent. This shows zero respect or decency.
3. My grandmother very calmly and politely asked the waitress to stop screaming at her. Waitress continues to scream at my grandmother that she's not screaming. She walks away.
4. I walk over to the waitress very calmly and immediately apologize for her if she's frustrated with my grandmother, and explain that my grandmother is always particular about a cup of joe being fresh. I apologize if we offended her but I explained gently that it is not okay to scream at my grandmother. She's old, she's a customer. I was cut off by the waitress and she decided to scream at me in return. I am a very well educated individual, that has worked with intense people and usually spend my days playing mediator. I know how to speak calmly to difficult people. I have been a waitress, a retail cashier, worked in a grocery store for years prior to finishing my masters. I get its tough- this was not warranted in any fashion, and even if asking for new coffee was unreasonable, screaming and chastising anyone is NEVER okay. It's humiliating, its grossly disrespectful, and its downright abusive.
5. We never received an apology. We were over charged for our meal. She came at the end of the meal, did not offer to get me a refill until we were done our meal (would've been nice while eating my meal).
Worst dining experience I have literally had in my entire life. I am beyond furious."}
{"text":"I was here with my family for the thanksgiving dinner and it was amazing. The service was also excellent and I will definitely be back for dinner another day. I highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lovely staff, and the standard Ricky's menu which is always great. We have never had a bad meal in this restaurant, and we have been coming here for years. There was one time we had a small mistake on one of our meals, and it was corrected immediately with a smile.  Highly recommended for a hangover brunch."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here a number of times for all day breakfast after shopping trips to the Sunridge mall.  Since breakfast is my favourite meal of the day, I just get a craving every once in awhile you know?

Each time the service has been pretty standard, not terrible or anything, but good enough not to ruin the visit.  Food has always been acceptable as well, I usually enjoy the Perogy breakfast or the Blackstone Breakie-bowl.  Portion sizes are always filling, which I like since I enjoy getting my monies worth.  

So, if you're having a hankering for breakfast at any time of the day and you're in the area, stop here.  It'll satisfy your tastes!  Better than having mall food at least, right?"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this Ricky's in about a year, but my memories are fairly fond. My friend and I finished classes at MRU around the same time, and frequently we would take the bus to Chinook for a little shopping time, which usually led to us heading over to Ricky's for dinner.

It's not the greatest restaurant with the greatest food, it's just your average place to eat and fill up. As pathetic as it is, the only thing I have ever had here is the turkey club sandwich, and the only reason I eat it is because of the fries: crispy on the outside, soft inside, good portion, and not over salted. The only reason I only have the turkey is because I only eat turkey and chicken breast, and their chicken option is too hot for me to handle (yes, I'm very particular).

The atmosphere here is really good and the service was always consistently pleasant, then again my friend and I were here so frequently the hostess recognized us. We only ever had one mix up with our food, which sucked, but we could deal with it."}
{"text":"Was there for a business lunch meeting.  I ordered their Mexican Tostada Salad that had (among other things), turkey on it (you know, as the main protein for the meal).  I don't think there were even 2 tablespoons of shredded turkey in the whole thing.  But, kale.  Lots and lots and lots of kale.  Including lots of inedible kale stalks.  For $16.99 I expected a lot less filler and a lot more of the protein part.

The food took forever to arrive.  The person I was with ordered an omelet, which showed up first, unceremoniously, and with no indication when mine would arrive (which, fortunately, wasn't long after).  It was dropped off without a word.  Our server DID NOT CHECK ON US ONCE during the entire meal.  She did not ask how everything was when she came to clear the plates.  She brought the bill and the debit machine without asking if we were ready for it - basically as if she were trying to get us out of there.  The restaurant wasn't that busy and there was no call for that.

I can think of many other places where I can get a much better meal and much better service for $17."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I had the Philly steak sandwich. It was good this time.
I cannot believe they charge $.75 Hot Sauce

The menu and the bill holder was dirty and stinky. I told the server about this at this time and she just looked at me like she had no clue what I was talking about. 

I ask to talk a manager but there was no manager on duty at this time"}
{"text":"Wow, it was not to busy here but service was still slow. When I asked for more coffee cream, my coffee got cold while waiting, then I had to wait while they had to make a fresh pot. Food was substandard, rotting fruit in the small fruit cup, burnt French toast. There server did not care about the issues at all, nor the manager that was on. I will never come back to this location!"}
{"text":"Nope.. nope.. no 

This time we went at about 2 pm and it was DEAD.  They sat us in a booth next to the kitchen and it was FREEZING. 

Boyfriend had the club sandwich, i had the calamari salad

Talk about taking ichiban noodles and putting them into a salad, if I would have gotten a bowl of hot water I would have had a free soup. 
The calamari was soaked in the dressing and cold and the cornbread that came along with it was gross and to crumbly. There wasnt much salad, just a couple of leaves here and there and some over/y large yellow peppers.. and way to much sauce

His sandwich was cold, and was cut into 3.. yes 3 pieces, two tiny triangles and then one whole half piece..

Please for the love of food, show your cooks how to cut vegetables and lettuce and use presentation properly.Its sad to see food abused like this. 

Our server took forever to come back and get our plates, even though i could see everything she was doing... which wasn't much.

we probably wont come back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the area service was excellent and food came out in a timely manor"}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience here. We went for Breakfast, and ordered an eggs Benny, and a egg/bacon/toast/hashbrowns usual combo. 
The waitress was nice, very nice attitude, a little slow on the coffee refills, as we waited over 25 mins for our food. 
The food came, and the eggs/toast etc. combo was hideously prepared. Overlooked, gummy, old sausages, crispy sticks of burned bacon, and the hashbrowns were literally hollow inside they were so overdone and dried out, all covered in burned onions and peppers, which were also black. We asked to speak to the manager/owner who took about 15 mins to come to our table, and he grabbed my plate and when I addressed my concerns with him, the only answer I got was \"Yup\" condescendingly. \"These sausages are severely overcooked\" \"Yup\".. As an example. 
He then proceeded to tell me that they had made about 25 batches of hashbrowns so far, and I was the only person who complained, and I was being silly. This \"Owner\" of over 4 Ricky's establishments as he so informed me, is the worst of the worst. 

Never again will I patron this dirty, dive hole of a restaurant."}
{"text":"WORST RESTAURANT EVER? if your looking for a place that has dirty floors, shit food & terrible staff than you've found the right place. Not only did our food arrive late and cold it wasn't even made properly, when we took it back & asked for a refund they accused us of taking cheese off the nachos I had gotten, nachos that also had barely any bacon & no extra onion like I had asked. They then proceeded to charge my mom $13 for 9 pieces of overcooked calamari, and to finish it all off the cheese on my brothers grilled cheese was hard & crusty. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone who thinks it's a nice place to take your family. The best part of the whole experience was having the short bleach blonde haired waitress swear at us & give me the middle finger."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here, the food is consistent. The service is speedy. My coffee is always full and hot. The servers are friendly and I've never openly heard anyone complain about their jobs. These are all fantastic signs of a decent place to work. Chorizo breakfast bowl with the jalepeño hollandaise is hands down the best breakfast I've had there. I will come for dinner and this item is on the all day menu. The price is right for the amount of food you reciev"}
{"text":"This location is one that is a 2.5 bordering on a 3 star place. The service is okay...a little impersonal but polite and efficient. Some of their menu items are quite tasty (breakfast skillets, specials) but others are just ho-hum-blah.  I do like the decor in this location..sort of family restaurant meets cafe. It is well taken care of too and doesn't have the dated old look some other Ricky's locations have.

All in all this place is certainly not a destination, but if you are in the area and are looking for a middle of the road experience, Ricky's will get the job done."}
{"text":"A group of us go to this Ricky's at least once a month for breakfast and it is always a nice morning out. While the service is usually poor, we are willing to put up with it for a nice breakfast at a decent price. I enjoy their menu and look forward to our next trip there for breakfast. I have yet to try any of their desserts, we are usually too full from breakfast to even think about it."}
{"text":"If i could rate this place a zero i would, unprofessional staff, uncaring, substandard food with high prices. Soggy Shrimp, unseasoned food, 
Brought concern over meal to hostess as waitress was unavailable throughout our meal and her comment \"well was the rest of the meal ok\"
Spend your hard earned money elsewhere..."}
{"text":"I checked out this location recently for breakfast and the restaurant is brand new.  The service was very good and the eggs benny were excellent.  I would return here in the future for more breakfasts."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here on a quiet Saturday afternoon (okay it was today), and the interior seems to have been redone since last time we were here. The menu is vast and causes a bit of indecision: the all-day breakfast vs a veggie burger vs pages of other stuff. I order a veggie teriyaki stirfry, and my wife gets a veggie omelette. They both arrive quickly. The coffee is nice. The football game is on in the background. They strangely seated us next to the only other couple in the big room, but their baby was cute so it's even. 

The food was above average. The stir fry was a bit sweet but had lots of vegetables and came with a nice flatbread. The omelette was one of the better ones I've had lately. There was a spice or herb in the omelette that was a pleasant surprise. It might have been lemongrass, but we were just guessing. It was mildly interesting at first, but it got a bit much by the end. 

There was way too much food on each plate, even though we arrived quite hungry. And it was presented beautifully, like they sent us the one they were going to photograph for the menu cover."}
{"text":"it's not very expensive and you get good value for your money. wednesday is kids eat free night and they have a clown! the gods was good and hot. they have deal of the drink day and a wide variety in the menu. the stuffed hash browns and amazing."}
{"text":"Friendly service doesn't make up for a slow kitchen and spacey server.  On a slow night, I am not sure what took so long.  And why was she in such a hurry to clear our plates?!  I mistakingly chose the Moroccan chicken with little Moroccan flavouring and mushy rice.  I think that they should rename this \"favourite\" Maybe Moroccan Mush."}
{"text":"Club sandwich and chicken soup were fantastic !! Beef dip came out excellent !! Steak sandwich cooked to perfection and fantastic service !! Thanks for a great lunch with my family !!"}
{"text":"This seems to be the place that people go whenever the others are full. 
I asked to substitute the hash browns that came with the meal with anything else (one strip of bacon or one sausage) but they said that it was not possible. 
So to maybe save them a few cents, they made sure I would not comeback in the future."}
{"text":"I don't like the seating.  Service is so-so.  Some great breakast dishes

4.5/5 perogie and egg platter
4/5 grand forks breakfast
2/5 stuffed french toast"}
{"text":"Horrible place to go to, the staff are extremely unfriendly...  If you want a happy returning customer, then I highly suggest you do a little more training, or hire better staff. I am am definitely not returning. 

The food there is mediocre, definitely not worth the money or service."}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast you can't go wrong here. We came before ice fishing a few days ago and the service was solid. They took our drink order within minutes and our food was out shortly after we ordered it. Our server was very good and attentive, but the place was empty. 

As for the food, it's a good breakfast. The portions are better than average and everything was cooked well and tasted fine. It's your typical breakfast."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for breakfast and occasionally Friday night special suppers since they opened. 
With the new renovations makes this place new again.  We have seen staff come and go over the years, not once have we ever had bad service or food. The staff are very friendly with smiles on there faces and the food is delicious.  
Today we had a wonderful breakfast of bacon, eggs, hash browns with toast. the eggs done just right with a endless cups of coffee. 
Like come on it's all about the eggs and crispy bacon!!

Parking is plentiful 
Saturday and Sunday are very busy so be there early. If you show up later in the morning be expected to wait for a table. Don't get me wrong the wait is not long, but if your hungry it could be. 
Love this place we will be returning for many years to come.
I'm definitely a Loyal customer"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. The food is pretty good when you finally get it. I would understand if it was busy or something but it was pretty quiet. And I wonder if the staff know you can hear them when sitting in the booth next to the kitchen. I am sorry if you got yelled at by your boss but can I have my cold eggs and waffle now? And to the male server reading the newspapers at the front, your teammates might need a hand. Good bacon though."}
{"text":"This is our neighbourhood Ricky's. We love it. Always room for us, great prime rib. We've had one problem there in the 50 times we've been so we will still give them a 5 star"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on a busy holiday Monday the service and food was fantastic! Had the breakfast special, food came out fast and fresh.. Also came here on a slow Saturday afternoon for lunch and it was consistently good!"}
{"text":"You know I'm going to like this Ricky's because it's in one of my favourite places in the city: The Country Hills Plaza. What is it with me and this plaza eh?!?!? I dunno, I just LOVE it. 

Ricky's is a cute joint to head over to for a meal. Unlike most people, I like going to Ricky's for a late evening snack, rather than for breakfast. I don't love their breakfast & brunch, but I do love their grilled cheese sandwich. I usually head over late at night, at like 8 or so, and enjoy their grilled cheese, fries, and a side of cardiac arrest. 

I ask for the grilled cheese to be prepared on whole wheat bread (it makes it feel a smigen healthier) and I ask for vinegar so I can sprinkle that on my fries along with ketchup. 

SO. GOOD. 

If you're in the mood for some soul food, head over to Ricky's and order the grilled cheese with fries. That break up wont feel so bad, the world wont feel so cold, and the week wont seem so dreadful. I promise."}
{"text":"This is the best Ricky's in the city for breakfast hands down! I've been to many of the others around the city and the breakfast and overall service isn't as good.

I find this location is much less busy then the others which definitely is a bonus because you don't have a long wait and the food comes out fast.  Other locations you are rushing to get seated and rushed to get out for the next ppl waiting. 

I would rather drive across town to this location then to go to the Rickey's in our own neighbourhood for the food quality, portions sizes, and quick service."}
{"text":"Friends & I eat there all the time!!  My favourite has always been their Stuffed French Toast.  No more!!!  I had it at noon on Sunday & should have sent the dish back because it was barely luke warm (the filling is made with cream cheese).  Big mistake!!!  I was up in the night throwing up together with horrendous diarrhrea.  As I write this, my ribs feel like they may have been cracked due to the severe heaving.  P.S. -- I had a light dinner at home, so ....."}
{"text":"The first time I brought my wife and kids here, the food was not great, but at least our server was pleasant and courteous (except slow). Something like 2-1/2 stars for that visit.

But the second (and our last) visit was worse than that: First, when we arrived, there were some people waiting to be seated. Several people who came in after we did were seated before we were. I peered around the corner and the hostess suddenly \"noticed\" me and pretty soon we had seats.

When we got to the table it was not properly set--we only had knives. The waiter did mutter something about it, but the rest of the silverware never came. This pretty much reflected all the service we got from the waiter, as she initially forgot our drinks, then brought them so late after being reminded about them that we were already finished eating! Also, my drink was about 3/4 ice and just a splash of pop in the glass. I would have complained and asked for more, but she made herself so scarce that I realised I'd be lucky to get a refill at any point soon. I asked for ketchup, which never came, so I got up and grabbed it myself from the station. Several employees saw me, but nobody batted an eyelash at this.

She never came by and asked us how our food was. And then we waited and waited ... and waited after we were finished eating, and someone else (who'd walked by our table three times and must have finally taken pity on us) cleared the plates. I knew she wasn't our waiter, but I asked her for our bill anyhow. She responded that she would \"tell the server.\" And our waiter came by a little later, gave us the bill and said we could pay at the front. Then she was gone.

The food itself was edible, but below average. Certainly not worth what we paid.

The thing that irritates me more than anything else about this restaurant is that they are enjoying lots of business right now because the Denny's a block or two away is closed for renovations. Ricky's is the closest family restaurant to us, and they must be aware of this lack of competition as reflected in their disinterested, sloppy, and matter-of-fact customer service and below-average food."}
{"text":"The waitress seemed to exude negative vibes from the moment I arrived with my two daughters. I think she thought I was hitting on her, but I definitely WAS NOT. She arrived at our table in the middle of a conversation I was having with my daughter and when I said something about my daughter's age, she gave a look like she thought I was asking HER her age. A pissy, surprised, annoyed look. Geez, lady, let me have some time with my kids and don't think every word uttered is about you!

Fine, we gave her our orders, and then we waited ... and waited ... and waited ... and ... well, you get it. When the food came, my daughter's waffles had no whipped cream, despite the menu CLEARLY describing whipped cream. So my daughter (who is 7) asked about the whipped cream. The waitress responded as though it was a special request (not politely or respectfully) and the whipped cream *never came anyway*.

Second, I hate the chunks of potato and onion mess they serve at Ricky's, so I asked the waitress for shoestring potatoes instead, since I really like the way Ricky's makes those. She forgot and, when my (cold) potatoes arrived, they were the kind I don't like to eat. She didn't write down our order, and I guess her memory isn't quite what she thinks it is, since she screwed up both orders.

It wasn't just us, by the way: I heard her apologizing to other customers for forgetting things they asked for as well.

So, as a small piece of advice to Ms. Take-Everything-Personally-and-Forget-Everybody's-Order: Maintain a pad of paper. Learn to write if you have to. Stop screwing up our orders, please. And it's NOT all about YOU.

Food was not very good, either: My pancakes were soggy. Eggs overcooked. Bacon, inexplicably, was burnt on the tips and greasy/borderline uncooked in the middle. How is that even possible without laser beams and poison gas???

The presentation of my plate was bad: It looked as though they ran out of large plates, so the (overcooked) eggs were thrown on top of everything. The (unasked-for) potatoes were overflowing the plate and the toast was stacked up ridiculously high. I couldn't even see the sausages and bacon thanks to the layering of food overtop. The first bite is taken with the eye ... and all I saw was a vertical stack on a smallish plate. Wow. I still marvel that I PAID for all this.

After we ate as much as we could, we waited ... and waited ... and ... well, you know, for the bill. Finally, we just went to the front and she came, all flustered and quiet to print out and present the bill. We walked across the parking to lot to the DQ for dessert, because I was damned if I would spend an extra cent in this poor excuse for a restaurant.

I don't want ALL the blame placed on our waitress: She looked very busy and more than a little overwhelmed by the number of people. I, instead, blame the management of this sham for not training staff properly, not staffing it sufficiently, and hiring marginal personalities as the public-facing representatives of your inadequate and underachieving mediocrity. Shame on the lot of you.

You won't see us back again."}
{"text":"The serving staff at this location are so good, and have been there for a very long time.  They are very friendly, and great with kids.

There's always something on the menu for anybody and for this type of restaurant, the food s good.

The only issue we have had is that some days they do get short staffed in the kitchen and the wait times can be way too long.  Yesterday we waited 40 minutes for our food."}
{"text":"We went to brunch at Ricky's, the place was not that busy.  Started by having our waitress tell us she was sick as she handled our silverware and told us she had to go home.  Our next waitress, Kendra, messed up 2 of our four orders and the third plate had a hair on it.  When the hair was found, she just asked what color if was and never did anything or apologized once.  I would give zero stars if possible.  Terrible service, horrible food."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant several times in the last couple of weeks, and have had consistently wonderful service, and great food. The restaurant is clean, and well lit. When I was shown to my table last night, the host made a point of giving the table another wipe-down, just to be sure. Several people asked to make sure I was enjoying my meal, and I was even offered a newspaper or magazine when they saw I was dining alone."}
{"text":"The only issue that we had is that the coke was flat. The waiter came and brought coke from the bar as he said the other one had a problem, the second coke was still flat. This is the second Ricky's that has had this problem, otherwise everything else was fine."}
{"text":"I had the chicken avocado omelet. Avocado on top looked like plastic. Also tasted like plastic. Wife said her food was ok. Our daughter liked the fruit cup we got with one of the meals. The service was really good though."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for breakfast on a fairly quiet Sunday morning.  As there were only about six tables seated and plenty of staff, we were looking forward to a relatively efficient experience.
I ordered the Blackstone breakfast bowl, my wife the Traditional Bennies.  We ended up sending both meals back as they were cold by the time they made it to our table (it's fairly obvious that my meal hadn't been warm for awhile, as the shredded cheese they layer between the eggs and hash browns hadn't melted at all).
Our server offered to microwave the meals for us to warm them up.  They ended up supplying us both with fresh plates in the end, both of which were considerably warmer than the first try.
Not sure we'll go back- we used to frequent a Ricky's in Edmonton where the food and service were consistently excellent, unfortunately we're still trying to find the same from a location in Calgary.  It's frustrating when you're paying roughly $15 for a plate of food and it can't be delivered to your table before it completely cools off."}
{"text":"Would rate zero if I could, despite the restaurant being dead we have to wait to be seated. She decided to try to seat us in the one booth that has a ripped seat, despite the whole place being dead. The food was so horrible we ended up eating jam and bread, lady wouldn't even exchange 3 pancakes for a few pieces of bacon. She demanded that pancake can only be exchanged for toast. I hope the owners read this and either make a change or shut that trash store down. Not coming back. There is a reason Dennys is always busy and Ricky's is dead, not just location."}
{"text":"I love Ricky's, but not this location. I ordered my usual (black stone breakfast bowl) and it came to the table in about 5 minutes. It was obviously cooked and already prepared before I ordered it. The meal wasn't hot and the eggs were weird looking thin flat pieces... Never seen this before. They're supposed to be scrambled..."}
{"text":"There are other Ricky's restaurants that are pretty good I'm told, and I may go there, but I will never return to this particular location.  Here's why:

The hostess should be fired immediately.   She went to clean a table that she had promised to seat us at in short order.  She proceeded to seat a party of three that walked in the door five minutes later.  It would have been a booth, which would have been nice.  So that loses a star.    After we sat, we waited 10 minutes before a server paid any attention to us whatsoever.  When we finally got a chance to order, we then waited another 20 minutes for our food.  These are not exaggerations.  We actually timed these events.  So that loses a star, and that's generous.  I ordered a breakfast with eggs over hard.  I used the word hard three times, because I hate getting runny eggs at a restaurant.  I realize that this is apparently an unusual taste, as an abundance of restaurants mess it up, but it is my taste and it should be respected.   I find that if I emphasize that I want my eggs hard, it often is.  On the other hand, Ricky's has incompetent cooks who do not know how to make a yolk hard.  Seriously, even if these people are 14, they should know how to do that!  I think I had it figured out when I was, oh I dunno, 9, and I can still barely tell the difference between a kitchen and a walk in closet, so yeah.  Less one star for that.  When we finished our meal, parts of which were nearly inedible, (and would have been completely so had we not been starving after enduring our endless wait,) we called the manager over to complain.  She apologized for the bad experience we had, but it felt insincere.  Maybe it's harsh to take a star away for that, but I do.  She asked if I wanted my coffee refilled and I said yes.  Ten minutes later she came back with the coffee and the bill.  Since I just wanted to get out of there, I declined the coffee when she brought it.  Frankly, I wish I could have declined the bill."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Slow, unfriendly and they'd rather lose my business than allow me to get 4 pieces of bacon instead of 2 bacon and 2 sausage even though I offered to pay more. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for supper, we all enjoyed our meals.  Our server(the owner) was funny, friendly and super helpful.  She went out of her way to help us print our tickets for calaway park the next day.  She was a life saver and we will definitely go  back again there are more items we want to try!"}
{"text":"Hours arent the greatest like other restaurants. Im always the only table occupied there .. even on a friday night. i have done dinner and lunch here. I have seen it busy on sundays while driving buy. 
Waitresses are decent , but ive had several drinks spilled and plates dropped..
Only eat here once every few years."}
{"text":"Just landed in Calgary.  Super hangry and here we are to pick up some stuff at shoppers and grab a bite before we hit the trail.

Ordered the soup of the day (minestrone) and California salad.   Minestrone soup was a watery tomato based broth with some veggies and beans.  Salad was fresh and hit the spot.

Super friendly staff and a busy spot on Good Friday."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with family and friends.  The food is typical line cook food, and the coffee is weak.  BUT, the service from Karen our server was awesome. And that is really what makes these breakfast outings awesome. And so she gets Ricky's 4stars."}
{"text":"We needed a nice place to enjoy a meal with old friends we had not seen in awhile. They were staying in Airdrie so location was a factor in our choice. We decided on Ricky's located in a decent enough plaza area, exterior impressed. Having never been to a Ricky's I had no idea what to expect, I had guessed road house food and was hoping for it to be a little bit more upscale than the usual truck stop grill/lounge. The place was a little bit too lit up for me in an orangey tone for evening and we were seated right smack dab in front of the kitchen area. We got to hear several of the cooks' favorite songs sung by... themselves! Menu was too large and overwhelming, breakfast, lunch AND dinner served here. I guess that was another clue that it would not be the best choice for intimate dining. We played it safe by ordering some snacks and got out as fast as we could to go somewhere else for cocktails. I had NO desire to order a drink from here. Not our original plan but you roll with it and we will not return. Not that the snacks were bad but when you go out to eat you would like to have a meal when hungry and not look SO forward to seeing the bill. No complaints on the service but nothing remarkable about it either."}
{"text":"I can't find the one on 16th but it's the one near chillies . Food was good but for the prices they are stingy with portions ...not that I wanted more but it's not.cheap . Service was fast to friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food is great and prices are reasonable. The server was friendly and consistent!!

This place deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times to meet our friends for breakfast on the weeknd. More often than not, we have to wait for a table - as it is one of the go to places in Airdrie - me thinks. 
There are several regular servers I have seen there over the past 2 years, and for the most part, they have the service down to a system that works. Occassionally I will go in and have an odd experience - like this past weekend. We were seated and noone came around - I brought it to the attention of a young server - I asked for coffee for the table and mentioned that I had no cup and that noone had taken our order. He just started pouring the coffee, then poured another, at which point I said - \" Can you say something? \" LOL it was an odd and funny moment.  The server later apologized said he zoned out... It wasnt a big deal  He was young and hey we have all just zoned out like that - it was the exception at this place re service not the rule. 
Basically though - the service here is fast and efficient and the food is consistently good.  The coffee is always quite good and the pace of the place always reminds me of a busy diner.  Be prepared to wait on the weekends in the morning for a table, but I think you will always be satisfied with the value for money and the reliable service."}
{"text":"Not so great.  Not busy at 1pm on a Tues.  One other table plus ours in the upper level.  The atmosphere is nice.  Manager seated us, brought me coffee, did not bring cream for it.  Waited.  Got cream in a later trip.  Order was taken, no mistakes except my meal was cold.  Before it was brought, I wanted a coffee refill; did not have opportunity to ask as server never came by once.  Then she brought the food but there never was a refill and no water on the table either, so without both, its not a pleasant dining experience.  I finally told a different server (French lady, who seemed better) that my food was cold.  She offered to have it redone; I asked to have it reheated.  Mistake.  Wasn't much better the second time around.  Got my refill, but it sure took time.  The French lady checked back to see if my meal was better.  I said 'yes' but it wasn't, but I didn't want to keep on complaining.  Other meal at the table was a burger.  The cheese was picture-perfect but the cheese was flattened and hardened within the burger, so although it looked cute, it would have been better to have melted cheese in the burger instead.  Fries were OK.  Asked for 3rd refill of coffee; got it but had to ask for cream as it never came with the coffee.  The staff are not observant or organized.  A good restaurant would have staff on the ball.  I went to the washroom.  Hot water in the sink taps and a choice of paper towels or blow dryer thingy.  I'd give it a 10/10 for the bathroom.  On the way back, I saw my server standing at the computer on the upper level where we were seated.  She didn't appear to be doing much of anything.  After a wait, I got my coffee but again, had a wait for the check.  You have to pay the server and not a cashier, so its another wait to pay it."}
{"text":"First time at Ricky's, what you can expect here are the regular dishes like, pulled pork, ribs, prime rib sandwich etc. done right. serving au jus with the prime rib was a plus but i inhaled the sandwich. our server was nice. They don't give straw with water unless you ask for them. 
Washrooms were clean, thats a good sign."}
{"text":"We tried Ricky's about a week ago because I really needed a good breakfast, and it's disappointing at other places in town. A rash of bad service or uninspired food pretty much ruins a guy's day, ya know? Thankfully, Ricky's was  a pleasant surprise, enough that we went back again this week. 

Ricky's is a western Canadian restaurant chain, so I've been to other before, with varying degrees of happiness, and Airdrie's seems to be a good one. We've tried a few breakfast items over a two occasions, and so far, so good. My top choice on the menu is the Waffle Big Breakfast, where you get half of a waffle, 3 strips of bacon, 3 sausage links, 3 eggs, and the \"Stuffed Hashbrowns\". Stuffed Hashbrowns are basically the thing I would keep going back for - simply shredded hashrbrowns that have cheese, green onion, and sour cream mixed in to make a rich, delicious, calorie-filled treat. We've also tried the eggs benedict and the breakfast bowls, and both have  been great - the Blackstone Bowl is definitely worth trying if you're trying to decide on what to order. 

The atmosphere at the Airdrie location is great - more of a restaurant and lounge feel than the typical breakfast  place, with staggered high-walled booths so you're not tripping over other people's morning conversations. The staff is very attentive and friendly, and the coffee doesn't really get a chance to run dry, which is exactly what I need in the morning. Meals haven't taken long to get, either, and it's comfortable enough that you don't mind sitting around for one last cup of coffee before you take off after getting the bill. 

If I had to point out one flaw, it was that the waffles I've had on both occasions weren't' served as hot as I'd like them to be - the whipped butter  on top stayed pretty firm without melting ... I could have sent it back, but honestly, the rest of the dish was more than enough food, so I wasn't overly worried if my waffle was a bit cold. Everything else about the plate was great though - hot eggs, crispy bacon, and melty cheese in the hashbrowns.

Overall, I'm very pleased with Ricky's, and I think this will be my new go-to for Airdrie breakfasts."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this Ricky's location for brunch on a Sunday. It was awesome. I've had both good and bad experiences at Ricky's, but this was a definite good experience. The food was awesome and the service was great. Plus the price is good too."}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars if it wasn't for the burnt to a crisp bacon. 

Great service, decent food, family atmosphere. I ordered a large plate including bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes and toast which they graciously accepted my change to hashbrowns. Ill go back, but make sure my order includes soft bacon"}
{"text":"Im giving this place a 5/5 because our waitress was AMAZING!. She was such a joy and very prompt.

The food was also great. I prefer the breakfast over the rest of the menu only because I just love breakfast XD and there stuffed French Toast is to DIE for!!! Yummy!

The place itself is smaller then the usual but looks well kept and clean...

I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This review is for the Deerfoot Meadows location. I'll share this little secret if you promise not to overcrowd my new favourite breakfast spot! Finally, I've found a place to go for breakfast without a massive wait! The service here is quick with good food - I'll probably come every weekend!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot and it is right in our neighborhood!  Every once in awhile, just for variety, we try someplace else, and even though we are pretty happy with breakfast everywhere we go, Ricky's in Riverbend is where we keep coming back to.  We are here for breakfast every weekend, sometimes twice a weekend.  I have had most of the breakfasts on the menu, depending on whether i am dieting or not. haha!  However, my favorite is the chorizo brekkie bowl.  Absolutely delicious if you want a breakfast with some kick!"}
{"text":"They need to hire more service staff!! The breakfast is good here and I have tried a lot of things here but when I come on Sunday mornings there are only two waitresses working and Sundays are one of their busiest mornings so I will no longer come here on the weekends for breakfast. They have one waitress working half of the restaurant and another working the other half. They both ru around very busy and get orders wrong. Drinks take forever to come and refills take even longer because it is not there priority.  You can tell the food comes out quickly because when it comes to the table it is cold. I will be going elsewhere for Sunday morning breakfast now!"}
{"text":"This morning we went to Ricky's for the Canada 150 Pancakes. I wanted to give this experience a 1, however, it received a 2 because of one great outcome. 
The sign originally said you had to get these pancakes as a side to a breakfast but we didn't want to purchase a breakfast. We just wanted to purchase the pancakes to try. We were able to do that which I was very relieved about. There were 3 of us who went and we each got two pancakes so our total bill was $3 each. The pancakes were really big too so after 1 we were full and took the other home. This was the one good experience. 
The picture of the pancakes showed delicious strawberries and whip cream on the pancakes. When the pancakes came there was no strawberries or whip cream and they said no that's just for marketing purposes. We asked if we could add some and they didn't even have any strawberries.. just strawberry purée. Just one scoop of whip cream to be added was $1. 
Why put things in the picture for marketing purposes if it's not included?"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a simple meal from Rickys. Don't go expecting a high class meal because you aren't going to get one. That's one mistake I made once with the seasonal menu ordering 'Crab Cakes'. That's one thing I know- I will never order fish from this restaurant. However the meal I had today- the chicken tender breckie bowl was delicious. 
I was also very impressed because when I was joe able to finish my food, rather than having a styrofoam to go container they had paper so it is much better for the environment. 
The only reason this restaurant received a 4/5 is because they were busy and apparently our waitress had so many tables that we didn't have 1 consistent waitress - we had 4 and it seemed like they weren't communicating. We had our order taken twice and drinks, etc. 
:)"}
{"text":"Ricky's is like Denny's: locations are plentiful and the food is consistent. While not the greatest, it does get the job done. The girls at this location seem particularly friendly, and with the close proximity to my hotel, I've been here a couple time. Their salads are large enough in portion, but their non-traditional dressings might throw a few people off."}
{"text":"Real good, loved it and the cute staff, all the canadian girls must hike alot because they have beautiful legs ;) keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Been to a few Ricky's All Day Grill locations but it just so happened that we went to this one (Deerfoot Meadows) since I signed up on Yelp. Service was fast and friendly from the moment we walked in the door mid morning. Was seated and within minutes we had our water and coffees served. 

I ordered the ABC Benny which has avocado, maple bacon and Canadian cheddar atop perfectly poached eggs and nicely toasted english muffins.  The hollandaise sauce was yummy. It comes with a side of hash browns and sliced tomatoes but I substituted tomatoes for a fruit bowl instead. I love having Eggs Benedict for breakfast and for a Ricky's, it was a pretty delicious one. Refills on coffee and water taken care of by attentive waitress even at a busy time. No complaints and will be back."}
{"text":"Waited awhile at the front for someone to come and service wasn't friendly. Found a couple hairs in the food too, they swapped out what the hair was on, but then we found another. Brought the bill before we finished eating, and didn't receive the water we had asked for until we were almost done. It's new so it's clean and quiet, pretty small too.

Edit: Went back because it's so close to my house, still no better! Service is super slow and not very good. Waited over 45 minutes for our food on Sunday afternoon and didn't get drink refills."}
{"text":"Charged close to $3 per refill on pop?! wtf! The food was okay, but the service was incredibly slow.

Do yourself a favor pick one of the other restaurants in the complex."}
{"text":"We just went to Ricky's All Day Grill on MacLeod Trail in Calgary to treat ourselves after surviving horrific times and OMG it was horrid! We had the GS Bacon Cheddar Angus Burgers and they were tougher than burnt steak and the bacon on them was burnt! Still feeling heavy in my stomach! MacDonalds taste better and is cheaper! Disgusting! I even told the manager on duty and all she did was say she would mention it to the cook, what good does that do us?"}
{"text":"Service was slow, could use another server. Would give a half star if possible. Food could be a little better and was not even offered refill or asked how the food was."}
{"text":"I had the worst steak in my life; it was cold, chewy and greasy. Certainly overpriced, even if the price was $1, it's still overpriced. 
My order took almost 50 minutes to arrive, so they offered a \"generous\" 10 percent discount."}
{"text":"Ate here this am. Family of 4 with 2 kids. We were hardly greeted when we came in. Not one person working there had a smile. We felt like we were bothering them by being there. We ordered our food and it arrived in good timing however the kids meals were below par for portion. Both of my kids were still hungry after finishing their own food. Portion size was comparable to what you would give a 2 year old.  Also our eggs were under cooked and if the server bothered to come around we would have had the chance to tell her. She saw we were done and brought the bill. 
All in all it was decent food but the customer service was garbage."}
{"text":"2018.05.13. was Mother's Day. My boyfriend and I took his mother for mother's breakfast. Our original plan was going to The Cora Breakfast by 9 am. But, when we arrived at the restaurant,  it had a huge line up already. So, we had to change our plan to somewhere else for breakfast. There is breakfast place called Ricky's all day grill, which is located on 130 Ave as well, is right across the street from The Cora Breakfast. Ricky's All Day Grill is the same style restaurant as IHOP and The Core. It mainly serves Breakfast, and it has some locations across Canada. I had been to Ricky once in Surrey Center, BC. before. It had very excellent customer services there. After discussed with each other, we decided to have a try at Ricky's All Day Grill.

We arrived the restaurant quarter after 9 am. Interestingly, Ricky's All Day Grill was not busy at all. We found a table and sat down right the way after we arrived. The server lady put us down to the table right beside the door. When we asked her to sit another table inside the restaurant, she was totally negotiating us. So, we had to sit down the table right beside the door.

After that, she brought us the menu and drinks, we began to take a look at the menu. Then, she came back to take the order for so long.  The items on the menu were the similar stuffs to Ihop and The Cora. Mommy and I have ordered the same thing. Both of us ordered Quick Commute, which includes 1 egg with 2 strips of maple bacon, shredded hashbrowns and the slice of toast. Besides that, mommy had her morning die Pepsi and I ordered an extra Waffle. My boyfriend had Two by Five for his meal, which includes 2 eggs, 2 sausage links, 2 strips of maple bacon, 2 fluffy buttermilk pancakes and French toasts.

After waited about 15 mins long, our food came out of the kitchen finally. All the food were well cooked and tasty. I like the extra waffle more. It was sweet and taste delicious. The hash browns were well done too. We have finished all the food. We did not know what happened, maybe the food was not very clean or we ate too much. After few mins, three of us all felt not good and had to go to the bathroom.

I donot think we will go back to this restaurant for breakfast again."}
{"text":"FYI - For seniors, if you have the old Ricky's Senior Card still, you can get 10% off when you show it to the waiter staff.  Ricky's does not give those senior cards out anymore. 

Just had breakfast there today.  It was quickly served and brought to our table.  I had the Double - Egger Plate.  It was hot and delicious.  Ate 2 eggs, over easy, with brown toast and sausage links.  Instead of hash browns, I had tomato slices instead. 

As usual, the waitress kept coming by to fill our coffee cups.  Love it!!  Great service.  

Have to come back for dinner one day.  I want to try the Caribbean Ribs - apparently, it falls off the bones."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Tremendous food, super fast and friendly service. If you're in the Calgary area I highly recommend this place. We went for breakfast but I'll be going back for more for sure next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Should have known better.....my daughters pancakes were hockey pucks. My wife's 'toast' was soggy. My English muffins on my Benny were not toasted either and the 'hash browns' tasted just like the oil they were fried in three times! 

Save your money and go to ikea across the street."}
{"text":"My favourite Ricky's in Calgary. Always consistent. Liver & onions there are my fave. The owner Laura is wonderful."}
{"text":"I think I come here too much whenever I'm visiting Calgary. LoL!! I'm a big fan of all day breakfast so when I can have breakfast late afternoon I'm happy. Most of the time the service is good (not great.) It is kid friendly. It's also one of the rare places that serves turkey dinner. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times since moving closer to inner city. After having not-so-good service at the 16th Ave location in North Hill Shopping Centre I've decided to make the drive to this Sunridge one instead. I've not come across any terrible service, but mind you I come mid week during lunch hours when it isn't too busy. I've been having a French toast craving and I like the strawberries and whipped cream topping add on. Their kids menu has a great selection and comes with a free kids drink. Food is good enough for me to keep coming back."}
{"text":"When we moved here just over a year ago we had never been to rickys so we went for breakfast and loved it.  Every time we have guests in town we take them here for brunch and always have great service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Dining Area: 4/5
Food Quality: 4/5
Parking: 3/5
Service: 2/5
Value: 3/5

The food is actually decent at Ricky's. The major problem has to do with the inconsistency of service.  Some visits you get a great server who's quick and friendly, sometimes you get the angry lady who wants you to go away so she can go back to watching one of the many TVs.  If they could just get the service staff a little more engaged, this would easily be a 4 or 5 star place for families.  Side note: the parking lot is close by but kind of cramped and always overrun by the patrons of Woody's down the block."}
{"text":"Energetic staff and great milkshakes. One of the last places unafraid to make a real honest to goodness creamy shake.  The all day breakfast is a nice touch, though the \"Supreme Commander\" pizza was a bit bland.  Service is hit and miss depending on who you get."}
{"text":"The food was good and the price was right for what we ordered but the service was so slow! It wasn't very busy at all but we waited a long time for everything from drink orders to our bill. We may try another location next time."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here after our Saturday morning shopping trip. Got off to a rocky start  I ordered eggs bennie soft. When they came they were hard as rock. Server took them back and the next plate the eggs were done the way I had requested. I just wish they wouldn't use a mix for their Hollindase"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, the food and the service! I went to Ricky's with a couple of girlfriends for a brunch, and came out super satisfied. Had ordered their Swiss sandwich along with some sweet potato fries. It tasted on the spot! Aside from that I had one of the best milkshakes I had thus far in life. They probably dumped the whole vanilla ice cream jar with cream in it. Whatever it was, was wholesome and  yes rich as just how the doctor did not recommend it. Too bad I don't live in Calgary anymore, but I will definitely miss their milkshake all the way!!! Definitely check this place out for some quality soul food. 

The staff was really friendly, a huge bonus :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a spot that has great breakfast and let's you peak behind the restaurant curtain, this is the spot for you. The breakfast was fast and delicious. If you're lucky you will get a seat right near what we assumed was the managers office. From here you will get a glimpse inside the lives of restaurant worker. We were so fortunate that we were able hear about staff members trading shifts and not telling her manager. The manager in this case was not a happy camper, there were bears in her tent. Anyway, I'd recommend the pancakes!!"}
{"text":"Stranded in the Burbs' and need a greasy brunch? This place won't let you down. Kid-friendly too, with colouring pages and free toys to buy you some recovery coffee time. I recommend the Chorizo breakfast bowl. Get it with the cubed hash browns and get the three eggs poached or fried on top instead of scrambled. The ranchero hollandaise sauce has an addictive quality you can't leave alone, especially when combined with a little egg yolk. Toast on the side makes for a Lumberjack-level meal - try the rye. Inexpensive hangover cure every time."}
{"text":"I attended a family breakfast at Ricky's yesterday.  My uncle only ever orders a Brekkie-Bowl because he loves them so much.  My spouse and I had never tried one, so we went for it.  Oh Chorizo Brekkie-Bowl, where have you been all of my life?!  This is an incredible concoction and my spouse thought so too.  I had originally ordered the Calabrese Brekkie-Bowl but they were out.  It was a hot meal with some great flavors, spice and fresh vegetables.  I never eat hollandaise sauce, but the topping is actually a ranchero-hollandaise sauce and I thought it was awesome.  Even the brown toast was good and not over buttered.  I may never order any other breakfast item from the Ricky's menu again, as I totally understand what my uncle is talking about.

We had a table of 13 and while the service seemed a tad slow on a few occasions (understandably so), everyone was very friendly and the place was clean.  

Ricky's will see my business more often now because of this breakfast discovery."}
{"text":"Saturday night. Slow but the best salmon teriyaki I've had in a while. Coffee and banana cream pie for dessert. Big rock Honeybrown ale for dinner great company."}
{"text":"I love this place for brunch and it is so great to have something so good right on the door step. The service is good, the staff are friendly (they even know me by name) and the prices are reasonable. This is good for lunch too. My favourite for lunch is the grilled cheese and tomato soup. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best food in airdrie! Searched alot of restaurants before finding this diamond . Dinner is amazing here and if its true comfort homestyle food u want eat here. Staff are friendly too"}
{"text":"A standard breakfast place that serves good food.  Enough variety on the menu without overwelming people with choice.   The proxy to work when I am in town help so I can see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"This Ricky's seemed a little over priced for what I received. My one cup of very average tasting coffee was 3$ plus tax. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffle was cold and hard on one half (likely not fresh). The chicken looked much bigger and appetizing in the picture. All in all I payed about 19$ with tip for a very average, and dissatisfying meal. Your money is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'd been here before, and it has always been acceptable...things seem to have changed. A Groupon deal brought four of us in this past weekend for brunch/lunch on Saturday (intentionally missing the breakfast rush).  Once we were seated, which didn't take long, we were pleasantly offered drinks and menus...everything was great up to here. 

Our server came over as we were perusing the menu. After we inquired about the meal options for the Groupon, we all decided on something and placed the order.  Now we wait. 

We waited, and we waited, and we waited...and it wasn't just us. The restaurant wasn't terribly busy, yet it took nearly an hour for our meals to arrive...and our server only came by once in that time to warm up coffees or refresh other beverages. Apparently, leaning on the bar chatting with the other staff, or eating her own meal was more critical to her success on this day. 

Once our meals finally arrived, food was either dried out front sitting under warming lights, or waffles weren't even warm enough to melt butter.

I'm not sure what the reason was, and was reminded of when the economy was booming and the service industry had difficulty finding qualified people...this is not the case right now.  All I know is that a simple brunch should not take nearly 2 hrs! 

I, for one, will not be back to this location, as there are plenty of other options in Airdrie."}
{"text":"We went to this Ricky's yesterday's for our daughter's 6th birthday and not a single thing was mentioned about there so called birthday club, rip off and the staff completely stuck up especially our server! Thanks Gabriella for nothing."}
{"text":"Go to Ricky's between 12-15 times a year due to our 3 & 6 year old. Decent family restaurant with toys for the kids. We usually split our visits between this location and the one on McLeod (avenida mall).  Of the 4-5 times we have gone to this location, we always have an issue either with the food and/or the service. We will continue to visit Ricky's as it is our kids favorite...but NEVER this location again. Although most of our meals were comped... Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I wish i could give ZERO stars.

I have eaten at Ricky's locations before in Edmonton and enjoyed my meals. My visit to this Ricky's location has turned me off ever eating at a Ricky's again. My boyfriend and I went this afternoon and here's our experience:

We were seated in the nearly empty restaurant and both ordered coffee and a water, we received our waters (almost 10 minutes later) but only I was given coffee. It took an additional 5 minutes to get the server's attention to get my boyfriend his coffee. 

My boyfriend ordered the Perfect Prime Rib Sandwich with onion rings and a caesar salad to start. His caesar salad took 10 minutes to be brought out and the salad dressing tasted like it had been mixed with water AND we were charged $7 for it!!! Our food wasn't delivered for another 20 minutes and when it finally did arrive, things took a turn for the worse. His prime rib sandwich was abysmal. The meat was dry and flavorless, the au jus they provided for dipping tasted like water. The onions on the sandwich were soggy over-cooked. The onion rings were crispy but they had ZERO seasoning. What a joke.

I ordered the Grand Forks Breakfast. How can you screw up breakfast? I didn't know it was possible but they managed to do it. For starters, my MEDIUM poached eggs weren't even cooked. You could visibly see and taste that the egg whites weren't fully cooked. They were clear and slimy and my yolks were the palest I've ever seen! My bacon was tasty and maple-y and I probably would have enjoyed it if it hadn't been COLD. My toast was buttered only in the center of the bread, the hashbrowns were soggy, and my pancakes tasted like some kind of no-name brand instant mix batter. 

The only good thing I have to say about this place is that the coffee was good but when I asked our server if she could bring me a carafe of coffee (I was drinking mine quite fast) she informed me that she didn't have one and then proceeded to bring me THREE full cups. Needless to say by the time I was half way through the second one, it was cold. I didn't even attempt the 3rd cup.

I am not usually a complainer, I made my living as a server for 6 years and I understand that mistakes do happen and sometimes quality slips through the cracks, but this was outrageous. Not one aspect of the meal was up to par and we paid $46 + tip for the WORST meal I have ever eaten in my life. I will not be returning and I strongly encourage anyone reading this to take my advice."}
{"text":"We come here for breakfast fairly often and love it every time. It's no fancy shmancy atmosphere, but that just isn't what Ricky's is. It's a diner joint kinda place. Always clean and well-staffed. Food is always exactly to order. We did have a couple too-dark sausages once, but they sorted it out really quickly for us, so no complaints there. It gets pretty busy weekend mornings, but we think it's worth the 15-20 min wait. Definitely the best breakfast place in Airdrie. We've never been for lunch or dinner, so I can't comment about that. My favourite is the Classic Double Egger. Yum."}
{"text":"A very commonplace chain restaurant with \"Canadian\" type of food.

Nothing to dream about, nothing to be pushed away from. Ordinary.

Service is but the best part of my experience with this location, food quality and portion size being very average. Though - not expensive.

I can't imagine inviting anyone to Ricky's, but won't say \"no\" if invited - it is a very standard a-ok place."}
{"text":"Been to this location on a sunday food is good. Service is good. Portion though is not as generous but for the price...I ordered a calamari n it taste good...the portion is not as...
The serving time was just right. The customer service was great. Its not as busy for a Sunday night so if you want gud fud and fast service...this is your location. They close at 8pm I think on Sundays...
Go check it out..."}
{"text":"An honest opinion: My wife and I were visiting Calgary and wanted to try their burgers.  We got the bacon cheddar and the original deluxe. Both of them were fantastic! They were cooked and prepared well.  I didn't want to ruin it with condiments and so I enjoyed it as is.  I am glad that I did because I was able to taste a slight difference between Canadian and American beef.  As for the service, it was friendly and professional. In the end, we were very happy with our experience!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back here because it's not busy and its close so things should go quick but that never happens. Today was the last time I'll waste my time.  There is not enough people in there for your food to take forever or for the seating to take so long.  The portion sizes of hashbrowns seem to be getting smaller and the foods luke warm when you get it. There is one really good waitress that works there and I feel bad she's stuck at this location"}
