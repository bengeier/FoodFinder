{"text":"Potbelly Sandwich Shop is new to the Charlotte are with this being the newest location.  I am a sandwich lover and when you can pair that with soup, I am even happier.  So, Potbelly was definitely a lunch spot I was looking forward to checking out.

I arrived around12:00 on a weekday, and was greeted by a line.  No worries, any where in Charlotte during lunch pretty much has a line these days.  However, the line seem to move pretty quickly.  Potbelly is a order at the counter shop, first, select your sandwich, at which time it moves through the toaster and then add any toppings, lettuce, tomatoes, etc. and checkout.

I ordered the Turkey Club, but unfortunately they forgot the bacon, one of my favorite parts of the Club. However, the sandwich was great. Toasted to perfection with melted cheese and heated turkey. So good.  The broccoli and cheese soup was good, but a little heavy or thicker than I prefer.
Overall I definitely enjoyed lunch and will be sure to check them out again!"}
