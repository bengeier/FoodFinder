{"text":"This place has great sushi. The veggie stuff has a slight fish taste so not the place for vegetarians. Ask for extra soy sauce if you get take out. Other than that, it's some of the best maki and rolls in Toronto. Very little sitting space though and NEVER go on a jays game night or the wait is horrible!"}
{"text":"My fave sushi place. A little pricey but the serving size is big! Everything I've ordered here has been good. The only con for this resto is the wait to get a seat. Place is small and the wait is long. Worth the money you'll spend though!"}
{"text":"By far the best casual sushi spot, never once had bad sushi here. Its by my place and It's my everyday sushi fix. Asked for the torched salmon sushi, it's not on the menu but the chef will make it for you if your a sweetheart like me lol ! The quality of fish is next level ! Must try !"}
{"text":"Overall experience was good. The place itself is small, but cute, and very intimate. The stuff is very friendly, and always make sure you have enough tea or need anything else. As for the food, the fish is fresh, but they put waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much rice. That was a con of this place. The salad that came with sushi was nice with a good tangy dressing. The miso soup was tasty as well. At one point a little fly/bug flew next to me."}
{"text":"If you go here, do yourself a favor and avoid the chicken. It is rubbery (yes, I said rubbery) and highly disappointing--so much so, that we had our chicken teriyaki returned. Thankfully, and to their credit, the restaurant did not make us pay for it. The sushi rolls and vegetable tempura seem to be safe choices, however. The place itself is small and cozy, just try and ignore all of the flies...."}
{"text":"I like the dynamite rolls as well as the Salmon Sashimi. Kind of expensive. As is everything in this area (an area of no choice).   Sometimes not very cold.   I really liked it at first. Still the best place here I think (near cityplace).  It is kind of hit and miss though.   The staff is nice and the quality, when it is good - is quite good.  It should be great though, when it is 45-50 for 2 people, and for protein-conscious people, even more.   3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Expensive for what you get.  Rolls are kind of too big and overwhelming, this isn't the clean sushi you would get in a nice restaurant but their rolls do look impressive when you order.  I don't really like raw fish so don't eat the sushi, but my family (who are sushi fanatics) think the rice to fish proportion is a bit off and that fish isn't that high of a quality for money you pay.  I love their udon noodles though, it is always steaming hot and tasty."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COST! Mine sushi seems to be a franchise cause they have different locations uptown as well, the one in Richmond Hill is amazing, but this one dt is so bad that everyone should avoid going there. Period.  The food isn't that great for the price they charge, the fish are not fresh and service is extremely slow & bad. We waited 45min for our food to come. Also, the Korean guy waiter was very pushy, after we ordered he kept telling us that the food we ordered is not enough and kept asking if we wanted to order more... like WHAT? Since when did sushi restaurants do this now? And for anyone who wants to dine as a group - don't, they charge you 20% tip without warning you beforehand. I almost feel like we got scammed. All in all just go to another sushi restaurant in the neighbourhood, there're much fresher and better sushi out there at this price."}
{"text":"We  were looking for an early dinner prior to checking out the new Aquarium (which is amazing) and decided that nothing fits with preserving the oceans quite like sushi and sashimi.  Why haven't they invented a font for sarcasm yet!  Anyway the wife and I split a delicious dish of cooked scallops and vegetables and then a \"love boat\" which had over 50 pieces of sushi, sashimi, and I think two different rolls.  It was fresh and flavorful as well as plentiful.  This made it very different than many of the AYCE sushi places that seem to be having a race to the bottom to provide over priced frozen crap.  We were pleasantly surprised for a place sitting in what seems like a tourist trap for folks taking in events at the Dome (I still refuse to call it the R-word).  Add in her Plum wine, my large bottle of Asahi Dry, tax and tip and a very nice dinner for two still came in around $100.  Considering we felt absolutely stuffed in the end that was not too shabby.  There are some complaints about the service, and it seems that there is only one waitress and a part-time waiter to take care of the whole place.  Perhaps the service is better in the cold months when the patio is not open?    If things take a little bit longer getting to you then just try to enjoy them more when they finally arrive."}
{"text":"Two words to rule them all: Shitty. Service. No matter how luxuriously mammoth sized the rolls or how fresh-from-the-ocean the fish, nothing sinks my votes faster than terrible customer service and an expensive bill. (Ikura lovers: there is no salmon roe on the menu, so this is not the place to get your Ikura fix.)   We walked in for dinner, without reservation, and were quickly seated. The restaurant wasn't busy at all, so they get zero points for great service.  My boyfriend, allergic to shellfish, including crab, realized that all of the rolls contained some type of shrimp or processed crab meat. Thankfully, we also noticed the note on the top of our menus that specifically states that substitutions can be made with a charge: we have no problem paying more money, if that means that we can enjoy a sushi meal without worrying about our order. After all, we didn't think we were being demanding, considering that the menu states that substitutions can be requested. Moving along...  We explained the situation to the waitress, who refused to grant us a substitution on our roll order, giving us resistance, saying that we couldn't substitute salmon for crab or shrimp since it was \"too expensive\" a substitution request. We were annoyed, but found ourselves accommodating her, and finally, after much negotiation, we just asked if she could bring us an avocado and salmon roll. Done. Or so we thought.   Our order arrives: there is no salmon in the avocado roll. None to be seen. We asked the waitress why the roll had no salmon in it. Her response? We didn't ask for it! Now, at this point, you could only excuse such a miscommunication if the waitress didn't have a firm grasp of English: this wasn't the case. Upset, we attempt to clarify our order, and, with enough attitude to make us wonder if they would spit in our meal, we finally had our order sent to us. We barely had any appetite left.   We left the restaurant, with the staff barely dignifying us with any acknowledgement.  My verdict: with all the fantastic sushi restaurants in Toronto, this is one location that doesn't merit repeat business. Go to Ematei. Go to Sushi Queen. Go to Guirei. Go to to-ne sushi. Anywhere but here."}
{"text":"In a bit of an unexpected place, but sushi and service was good. Orangeville roll and dynamite roll were very good! However, I'd skip the yakitori. Tip: the buttons in the booths aren't actually connected - they are placebo buttons haha"}
{"text":"Small place, large portion of good food and a little expensive. Nice place to go on a date or with close friends. They accommodate up to four people. They also have some pretty exotic maki which you should ask try."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard getting a seat here, but it's well worth the wait!  There are only a few tables here, and 3 private booths. Try to snag one of those! You get to push a button for service. Yay!  On to the food. The sushi here is very fresh, and as you sushi lovers know, it's hard to get fresh sushi in Toronto. I have to hand it to their signature rolls, many of them (the non-fried ones) are delicious. You MUST try the Apple Cider roll. Its tart, sweet deliciousness will have you coming back here:) Second to that roll would be the Orangeville roll. Quite tasty! Avoid the lobster roll, it's not that exciting. They have consistent, good quality fish and really tasty combinations in their rolls.  Oh, note that the miso is overpriced for what it is. It really isn't that tasty. Also, I don't think they have dessert. But the meal does end with some nice fruit:)  As for service, they're very nice, but the food may take a while to come out. Last time, the wait was quite long, but they offered us their apologies and wooed us with edamame."}
{"text":"Very good sushi; service was a little slow. Beer served without glasses. Really enjoy the lobster roll."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying i would like to give this place 5 stars as I always enjoy the food there. The service is great: very friendly, attentive and accurate. While it was a great place in the winter, it's now a different story in summer, mainly because they don't seem to have any air conditioning. They prop the door open and run a portable AC unit (which of course doesn't work) and thus the place is  hot and full of flies. Not exactly conducive to a positive sushi-eating experience. When we arrived there for lunch last time they said we couldn't sit at a certain table because it was reserved for people \"picking up food\", and we noticed that the general cleanliness had gone downhill. Again, this is all unfortunate since the food is generally really good. I was a regular weekly customer, but I won't be going back until I see that these issues are addressed."}
{"text":"Convenience is a big factor for me and living at City Place this small little sushi joint is just one elevator ride down and 1 block over. The sushi is not by far the cheapest in the city but it is certainly very fresh and it seems like the sushi chefs have a rigorous standard for fresh fish. Case in point, their uni (when in season) is flown in from Japan. For those who don't like raw fish, they have a selection of cooked Korean dishes which aren't bad. So if you're in the area, this is not a bad spot to enjoy some fresh fish."}
{"text":"This place makes amazing sushi, and the staff are equally as great. Have been going here for years. Only drawback is it gets super busy when the Jays are playing across the street."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi, reasonably priced.   The restaurant itself is quite small, but not cramped. They have semi-private booths that make for a more peaceful dinner. I live at CityPlace, so mostly due to convenience, I am a regular customer here."}
{"text":"I come here about once every 3-4 weeks and think it's the best sushi I've had in Toronto. Tremendously generous portions of fish in each roll (usually one tuna roll and a wakame salad fill me up.) The mushroom soup, served in a stone pot with a few beef dumplings, is to die for. Service is always wonderful. I once asked for green tea ice cream and was told they have no freezer. I adore this place and continue to bring friends here. (My only warning being the restaurant is extremely small and suited to groups of 2-4 people, but the patio is nice in the summertime.)"}
{"text":"The best. Atmosphere is amazing food is so fresh u can't stop eating. Great for groups or late night date"}
{"text":"Well usually before I post a review I give the restaurant a few chances ... I've given this 3. 1 Take out (party tray) and 2 dine-ins.  Positives: - Fresh fish - Atmosphere is clean and decently quiet.  Downsides - Rice is much too mushy and soft. Very little or no rice vinegar. Falls apart when picked up and has a overly-sweet taste  - Service is one of the worst, but not THE worst. Expect a 30-45 min wait. The take-out was a 30 minute wait (party tray) and the dine-in was a 45 min wait both times. These were non-Friday weekdays in the evening. To be honest everyone who walked in the door was warned of the wait but hey, you'd think you're more special :)  - Waitresses forget to bring some of the orders and try to bribe you by offering over-salted beans. Usuaully the green beans you boil in salt they just sprinkle excessive table salt on top of them.  - For two people (Dine in) we paid 40$+ on both occaisions. Usually we can find places for 30-40 downtown with much better quality.   The reason the place is usually busy is because of the young adults in the surrounding condos. If the restaurant was located anywhere else they wouldn't be as popular.  TLDR; Try it once, but don't have high hopes"}
{"text":"This is a very small Japanese restaurant.  Not many tables are there if not counting the patio.   It has a lot of roll selection.  The rolls are much bigger than normal, both in diameter and length, and is sufficient to order one and fill the stomach.  The Mi-Ne Special Dinner which you can choose one from chicken or salmon or beef with 4 pieces shrimp tempura, 7 pieces sushi and maki with 12 pieces sashimi and teriyaki is good for 2 people.  Although the sashimi is not thick enough and in small pieces, they are fresh and chill. The tempura is freshly deep fried and the oil used is clean.  It is a decent Japanese restaurant.   There will be another branch open in Markham on Woodbine north of Apple Creek  Prices just increased from May 1, 2014"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in this area. I usually go in for take-out, but my experience inside the restaurant has also been pretty good.   The rolls are large and quality is excellent.   I always order the wakame salad and spicy salmon roll. Yumm-ee!! It does get busy when the Jays are in town, but a must try!   Cheers!  - T"}
{"text":"Mi-Ne a decent sushi restaurant in the Harbourfront area.  It's a small joint, but they have a good menu selection (hot dishes, sushi, sashimi, and rolls) . Fish is fresh and the preparation is good. Prices are a little higher than the norm no surprise this is a touristy area. But it doesn't take too long for the food to come.   They did allow for a substitution for the small sushi set , but were skimpy with the red tuna. I only order red tuna and salmon. (White tuna kinda iffy in the city, no one really carries the real Albacore)  Service was alright but I don't like the fact they talk in code behind peoples back, also notice someone getting a neck massage behind the back curtain?!  Strange."}
{"text":"Great food great service!  I love there love boat!!!!!!  Sometime it take a little time to serve but its worth it"}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi spots.   Haven't had anything on their menu to date which I didn't thoroughly enjoy.   Prices are a very slightly l bit on the higher side for the sushi industry. Probably due to location. But it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and only had good experiences. This is a great option to those who live in Cityplace and want to go somewhere other than a bar. Their booths are very intimate; they're perfect for a date."}
{"text":"Since I practically live on top of this place, I've been here a couple times with my sandals in February(yeah, that's how close it is). I pretty much treat this place as my diners place for when I'm too lazy to cook.  Let's just say that the food and service are pretty inconsistent. On some days, I'd get a pretty decent food and service. Hands up, the rolls on this place is really good. So, if you're scared of eating raw fish but want an amazing 'sushi', then this is the place for you.  Lunch is pretty good. They got some really good and cheap combos (don't expect china town price, but expects lots of gigantic rolls). However, never ever come to this place on weekend nights for dinner. Especially if you don't have any reservation. Because even though they're supposed to close at 10.30PM. They tend to run out of rice by 9PM. As some people here been saying, the service is really really slow. So when you order raw fish, it tastes horrible by the time it's in front of you. The service on this place is hit and miss. On some day, I would be slurping my miso soup and the waitress would bug me to move because they need to sit 3 people (they told me that I could sit anywhere when I came, so lesson learned: pick table that would fit my body like a corset) On some day, they wouldn't bug me at all and let me enjoy my meal.  Ignore the people who say that this place is expensive because it's sushi. Real sushi would cost you at least $60-$100. So yeah, with how big those rolls are and their location, me thinks the price is decent."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, very friendly. The private booths make for a very nice atmosphere. The sushi is the best quality I've ever tasted. The ratio of rice to fish was perfect. The happy boat is a must try for a nice variety of sashimi, nigiri and maki rolls. The only downside is it is definitely a higher price range. But you get what you pay for, and the sushi quality here is top notch."}
{"text":"I like this place. Its across the street from my building and offers a wide array of sushi and sushi like food items. Staff is also friendly although they might come off as anti-social, they still get the job done.  Although its rather small from the inside, the decor gives off a semi traditional feel that makes me comfortable whenever i dine there. The drapes for the booths are also a nice touch, gives you an aura/feeling of some privacy.   Only concern is its pricey but hey everything is expensive when you live in cityplace.  Would def visit again next time i feel like a quick dine for some sushi!"}
{"text":"I have ordered two party size trays from Mi-Ne on seperate occasions over the past couple of months and each time they have been able to deliver quality sushi!  The sushi and maki rolls are fresh and neatly presented.  My guests raved about the sushi platter and gobbled up every bit.  Price range for a large platter is about $60 ~50+ pieces.  Their prices are competitive with other sushi places in the area.  If you give them advance notice on your party tray needs, they will have it ready on time!  I have to try this place out for a meal, it is cozy and always packed."}
{"text":"I often order delivery from this awesome place. Few days ago, I visited the place for takeout and they gave me two free miso soups! :D  It's quite pricey but the signature rolls are huge and made with fresh ingredients.   I just wish they are consistent with the size. I occasionally get some smaller rolls."}
{"text":"OMG our waitress (don't know her name) was the cutest sweetest person ever.  We came after the CN Tower tour super late and then were closing but never pushed us to leave.  Sushi was super fresh and flavorful.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"OMG this place has become really bad. We used to go a lot and after a whole winter me and my boyfriend returned not just finding that they are increasing the price on an already expensive menu, but on top of that, the sashimi dinner my boyfriend ordered was so small and each of the salmon pieces was 1/3 of what we normally get. We felt like we were never going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch based on recommendations from coworkers and I wasn't disappointed. Like a few have said, the place is small and seating is limited. With one or two people in the kitchen and another working the floor, service can took bit longer than one would expect for a quick lunch. Our server wasn't particularly quick, but was very friendly every time she visited.  When I saw bulgogi and kalbi on the menu, I was expecting another sub-par Korean/Japanese restaurant. I've been to a good number of these before and have often been disappointed in the assembly of the food. Good sushi isn't just measured in how big a slab of fish you can throw on rice. You can tell if the kitchen has the skill and attention by how well they cut their fish, how neatly & uniformly their they assemble their nigiri and maki. My lunch (nigiri & maki combo), was very well made with obvious attention paid to the food itself. The nigiri was uniformly made and the fish was properly cut. Visit a low quality venue and you will see the difference - a loosely clumped ball with a chunk of formless fish lazily dumped atop. I opted spicy salmon roll and was particularly pleased. The salmon filling dominates this maki. Usually you see fat coat of rice enveloping a tiny dollop of fish but the opposite was true here. The salmon took it's rightful place as the star of the show. Rice was evenly distributed on all parts of the maki and it was tightly rolled together. Miso soup and salad were nothing to write home about, but the rest of the meal was delicious. My friend ordered a sashimi combo and it curiously came with the \"purple rice\" that I usually see at Korean restaurants. Despite this, he loved his meal.  Price wise, I think things are on par with other sushi joints. I've paid more for less and have paid less for salmonella."}
{"text":"the private booths a quaint lil touch.. good service and good food."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying: I live in Pickering and HATE driving. The mere fact that I actually make the effort to go to Mi-Ne speaks volumes.  I eat at random sushi places all around the GTA: all-you-can eat joints, overpriced spots, sketchy places with mysterious odours...I fear nothing in the pursuit of great sushi.  Mi-Ne definitely tops my list. As others have mentioned - it is on the pricier end, but, dayuuuum, it is worth it. The ingredients are fresh, the chefs are legitimately skilled, and when you pay a lot, you get a lot. The rolls are pretty massive, but not in that disgusting sort of way where it's stuffed with just sticky rice and no salmon/tuna/whatever.  I cannot leave without their New York Lobster Roll -- the sauce it comes with is AMAZING. I could dip my napkin in there and eat it, no problem. My favourite, however, is the Orangeville roll. It's perfect if you're a salmon lover. I also recommend the spicy salmon sashimi (it comes in three little clustered balls and is delicious).  The service is consistently good. I went there on Valentine's Day with my husband, and the place was packed, and even then, we weren't waiting all that long. The servers are courteous, helpful and quick to notice if your drink needs refreshing. My husband drinks about four glasses of water during every meal, so this is an important part of our dinners out, believe me.  If I could afford it, I'd hit up Mi-Ne every time I got a sushi craving (which is about once a week...), so I wish it were a bit cheaper, but at the same time, I'd hate for that to compromise quality, so for now, it's my 'fancy' sushi spot.  The only downside to this place is that it is freakin' tiny and it's always cold during the winter - as in, I have to keep my jacket on when I'm seated in the booth. They need to fix up the insulation or something because it feels like the wind is blowing in right through the windows.  And as a final note: if you're a whiner where it comes to waiting for a table, or if you feel you're too important to make reservations at a sushi place...don't come here. It IS a busy place, and it can be a wait - although it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Really observant staff that were attuned to the whims of my partner and I - this is the second best thing about this restaurant. The food was some of the best sushi and tempura I've ever had and the complimentary dessert oranges were sweet and delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible.. I waited 40 minutes for two rolls and I had to ask where it was. It was sitting there waiting to be served. Also, their Alaska roll did not seem like it had any Salmon. I am not usually a picky eater, but this place is a sad excuse of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay, so I got here at 8 pm - place was empty expect for 1 other table.  Server came to sit us. Told us we can sit in any booth. So we sat down in the middle one and was waiting. The server came to us after 1 min and told us we cannot sit here cause it is now reserved. WTF?!?! She told us to go to the next booth, so we went in the tiny room and it was not even cleaned up with dirty dishes everywhere.  So you telling me you have all these empty booths and I cannot sit in any of them.  Wow great service.   Don't think I will ever come back again.  Food was nothing to rave about and pricing is a little higher than average."}
{"text":"Great sushi, convenient location, great service.  I generally avoid sitting at the restaurant, it's always busy.  I live close and it's my go to sushi restaurant.  Definitely better than a lot of the sushi places on queen.  Their rolls are well made and the fish is always fresh.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the medium sushi platter for take out.  Sashimi was fresh and high quality but the rice was extremely tough, as if it wasn't fully cooked. If the rice was not rock hard I would give 4 stars for this place."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good: ...  Now that that's out of the way, the bad: Starting with the most important part about a sushi restaurant: the sushi. The sashimi was still partially frozen.  The rolls were uninspired and not particularly good. The service was extremely slow. They have these curtained booths to sit down at and I don't know if that had something to do with it or if their service always sucks but it took forever to order. And it wasn't even busy. To top off the clearly-not-fresh sushi and the bad service, this is one of the more expensive sushi places I've been to, even by downtown standards.  Overall this place made me vow to myself to slow down on experimenting with new sushi places in Toronto. There are way better places downtown and for less money."}
{"text":"We did a team lunch here today and I loved the place sans the service. And the service wasn't courteous and friendly. It was just that there was only one a lady waiting on everyone. Great food - I had the bento but tasted some of my colleagues nigiri and it was fantastic. I also liked the little booths they have with curtains - feels very intimate. It is not chic but a great value for lunch.  Heads up - it's tiny and very few tables."}
{"text":"A bit costly for sushi and rolls compared to many I had been to. Maybe its because of its location but still. The dinner plates are huge. Can totally share if your a small eater as it also comes with miso soup and salad.   Food: The a la carte spicy tuna rolls was pretty good. But the rice in it was just ok. Not fluffy enough and not enough vinegar it it. The wasabi is from original squeeze bottle ones rather than the fresh seedy ones that are the best and freshest. I got the Chicken Zen dinner combo that comes with teriyaki chicken, shrimp/veggie tempura, 3 cali rolls and 3 nagiri rolls, miso soup and salad for $21. The soup is just plain miso soup. No tofu or seaweed in it. Their chicken remind me of jidori chicken. It was ok but not great. Rice was ok but again, not as fluffy. Sashimi was also ok. Too much rice though and its not the freshest as its a bit firmer like the rice had been left out a little too long and hardened a bit. The California rolls that came with it also were the least fresh. The tiny fish roe in them were so fishy and possibly old and bad. Given possible doubt it may not be them that (a few hrs later) gave my husband and I diarrhea, it was the last thing we ate, same thing we ate together, and raw. So Ill let you all make that judgment call.   Service was great though. Server was sweet and always made sure my water was filled.   Still pretty pricey to me in my opinion too though."}
{"text":"Worst sushi ever!!!!!!!!!!Worst!!!!!!!!!!we order the sushi platter but the rice is so dry and doesn't even taste like sushi rice!!!!! the sashimi is not fresh at all!!!!!!!and their maki roll  is also terrible!!!!!!!!!! I won't visit this Korean sushi place again!!!!!and they are expensive!!!!!! If yelp allows me to choose 0 star, I will choose 0 for this \"SUSHI\" place !!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Mi-Ne in Markham, and this location downtown is very convenient for us but this is our first time stopping by here (and maybe the last). Service was great, the staff was kind and the sushi was prepared quick. But I wasn't very impressed with the food - the sushi was just OK, I've had much better and the price point was a bit higher than I was expecting.   There are quite a few sushi choices downtown, so I don't think I'd be stopping by here again for my sushi fill. Maki my way which is on King (around 10min walk from here) is a lot better bang for your buck, and also tastes better in my opinion."}
{"text":"Positive: The sushi is very tasty and well presented.   Negative; Dishes are overpriced, and the rolls are too big to eat in one bite. The waitresses wont smile at you because they are worried about getting wrinkles."}
{"text":"Exceptional!!!! Best sushi I've had in a while!!! Service was great. The waiters really took time to get to know us. Hey we have a hookup at the Marriott for next time  and the food... Amazing!!!! Fresh sushi. Rolled to perfection... Ambiance was beautiful... Small place though. But it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and perfect way to introduce the hubby to sushi.  The staff was so friendly with the manager interacting with patrons. The food was amazing."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sushi place in the city. Their rolls are huge and delicious, they have a few amazing unique rolls (for shrimp lovers, I highly recommend trying the Richmond roll...delicious), and their hot dishes are amazing (stone bowls/plates used to keep your food hot for your entire meal, and then some). My personal favorites are the yakitori, spicy bulgogi, age-dashi tofu, seafood udon....well, the list  goes on really.  The only downsides are that there aren't very many tables, so on busy evenings you sometimes have to wait. And they don't have enough staff to deliver their food very far (just to surrounding condo buildings I believe). But it is totally worth checking out, couldn't recommend it more."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Mi-Ne in uptown Richmond Hill. Always been satisfied with their food.    Went to this location. Their AC was weak on a hot summer day. Food came in 40 minutes.   The sashimi was not fresh. You can tell by just looking at the color of the Salmon. Retained too much water from being frozen so once you bite into it, all you taste is this rough texture, water and that old fishy taste.   The miso was so watery, my powdered miso soup at home that I get for a dollar is even better."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Been here twice now and the restaurant is nice. Classic Japanese look and a patio which was great when I went on a cool summer evening. The sushi itself is great and I'd say one of the best in Toronto. They use very fresh fish. But their other dishes are eh. They lack flavour and just a disappointment when comparing to their sushi.   Their prices are also over priced. I would pay their price for the sushi but at $20 for their bento which is more than other sushi restaurants is a stretch.  So overall, sushi worth a try for sure but if you're not into the raw sushi and you like the other stuff, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love this place. I usually go to their richmondhill/ Markham location on woodbine ave. But I live closer to Yonge and eglington now. It's very hard to find good a la carte sushi but Mi Ne does a wonderful job. They have many lunch specials that offer a good variety but also amazing dishes too. I just adore this place they offer everything I'm craving for."}
{"text":"My husband and I checked out this place on a Friday night for dinner. First things first, this is a small spot near cityplace area; not a spot to go to for the atmosphere as this place is very tiny and it smells like sushi! When we first entered i could not stand the amount of deep fried smell that was in the venue however you will get used to it after and won't notice it much. In terms of sushi we tried their signature rolls i.e. Orangeville Roll, Torch Rainbow Dragon Roll, Boston Roll and their standard Spicy Tuna Roll. Heads up the signature rolls are round $13 - $17 however they gave us 9 pieces instead of a standard 6 piece. The rolls were really well presented and they looked amazing! However i noted that all of them tasted similar with very minor differences. The Spicy Tuna Roll was average nothing too exciting. If you are just looking to satisfy your sushi craving this is a good spot to go to!"}
{"text":"Mi-Ne is currently my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto -- amazing, gigantic maki rolls, great soups (spicy miso and huge boiling stone bowls of Udon), and great service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a typical sushi place.  The reason I liked it is because the food taste good with a reasonable price tag.  I ordered the March $20 special for dinner (simple salad, soup, and sushi roll).  The soup was mushrooms (different kinds) soup.  The flavor was okay.  It tasted like miso soup plus the mushrooms.  The sushi roll I got was the A.S. dragon roll with both salmon and avocado wrapping.  I like this sushi roll a lot.  The restaurant is very cute and small.  This place is good for a cute date dinner and something quick.  It is not good for large group gathering."}
{"text":"Good solid sushi - we had the Winter Special which consists of mushroom in soup and gyoza or seafood udon and also your choice of specialty roll for $20. I chose the udon and the spider roll :) was really happy with my dinner and it's just what I needed during cold weather and after a hard day of work. Try Mi-Ne Sushi today! Includes miso soup, side salad, green tea and orange presented in a cute way after the meal!"}
{"text":"Sushi here was amazing! Outstanding customer service. One block away from the Roger Centre! I will certainly go back during my next vacation to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very very oily sushi. The maki were bad too. They were big, a lot of rice, but not a lot of fish :("}
{"text":"A small sushi joint near the Rogers centre/ city place. I've always wanted to try the markham location but on our day off we decided to check out the one downtown. For three girls, we ordered the lover boat special. Came with many different types of maki rolls, nigiri and sashimi. What I love about the rolls here is that the rice portion to the fish portion is like 10% to 90%.It was amazing. Tasted super fresh and was the perfect amount for 3 girls. They also have a huge menu of special rolls and bento boxes.  Prices are a little higher but the quality of the fish is definitely really good.  The only down fall is they don't deliver if you live more in the financial core of downtown!!! Their delivery guy walks to do their delivery.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite because it's close to home. Boy that was a mistake! I just so happen to walk up behind a family with a south Asian decent. They seemed like tourists and wanted to grab a soft drink. The restaurant's owner gave the poor guy a difficult time. I still stood patiently waiting for one of their three staff to acknowledge me and put me in one of their 5 empty tables. Instead I got told to move by one of their wait staff.  I waited patiently until they were done serving the person in front of me. Where they went wrong was they assumed that I was with the family ahead of me. So they ignored me until I spoke up and asked if one of their tables were available. Absolutely vile service here. Can't even remember how the food tastes because of the bad taste in my mouth from their customer service."}
{"text":"My neighborhood sushi joint, it's pretty good but very pricey.  I ordered a healthy to go meal for 2 and it came to 70 bucks.  They had good quality food though, can't beat that when it comes to raw fish and noodles.  The rolls very very healthy in size.  The ingredients were well displayed and fresh.  The restaurant was very small and I didn't eat in but the service seemed fast.  I would return because they had good food, but mostly because it's just at the foot of my condo... Aack, location wins again!!!"}
{"text":"Called Mine on Fri Jan 10 at 7:30pm to order delivery. The lady puts me on hold for 5min twice! Ok I understand you're busy. I only live 5min away by car, she says she can't deliver to me. What kind of a place can't deliver food to anyone that lives 5min away by car? Ok, fine I will come to pick it up then. She says ok, it will take 1 hour. I accept they're busy, fine. So I go there at 8:30pm and she says the food isn't ready. It takes another 20min for her to realize the food was already cooked and waiting in a bag. The lady tried to charge me twice by claiming I didn't pay yet! She is clearly incompetent and should not be working at a busy restaurant. I will NEVER order or eat at this place again! The food was otherwise good and tasty. Shouldn't take me 1hour and 20min for take-out sushi. Try Gonoe sushi at 262 Queens Quay West. Gonoe has delivery and can accurately and quickly take orders."}
{"text":"Delicious. Just pure deliciousness. And freshness.   The maki rolls were between $11-15 dollars each for 8 pieces, and between 4-6 dollars for 3 pieces. Single hand rolls were between 3-5 dollars, depending on the ingredients (no worries, they stuff these babies with your money's worth).   When I got to the restaurant I was famished so I wanted my sushi to come pronto -- I was a little annoyed that it took what felt like 30 minutes to get my single order of a maki roll. Also, I got a bad vibe from the waitresses; they kept rushing my friends and I to pay the bill and leave when the restaurant wasn't even completely filled.   A for the food. C for the service.  I recommend getting takeout. Also, for the salmon lovers, give the Orangeville maki roll a try -- it's seriously amazing."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with a few booths for seating and open tables. I remember decoration being modern with Japanese accents.  Staff was professional and serious.  Located right where the stadium is so on Christmas Eve after watching Disney on ice, we went straight here which was very convenient and cozy on a holiday night. Street parking is available.  We got the sashimi for two and shared it since it was just a pre dinner snack. Pictures are uploaded as well. It came with a bowl of rice and salad. The sake came warm in a pot which was heated, smooth and easy to drink since it was warmer."}
{"text":"More like a 4.5. Great place to eat if you're in the area. Not too great though if you're with a large group. I came here on a Saturday afternoon with my family after a trip to the aquarium and was seated immediately . Service was fantastic and fast. Our waitress poured our tea consistently throughout our lunch meal, and took time to explain each dish we ordered to us. I had the unagi don which was absolutely fantastic, and had plenty of eel. The rolls we ordered were very large and filling. The love boat (I believe it was called) was amazingly presented and had a large variety of sashimi and nigiri. Nothing was outrageously priced either. No complaints from me. Definitely would come here again if I were in area."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places downtown. Owned by friendly Koreans. Service is slow as it gets extremely busy at dinner time. If you live nearby, you can take advantage of their delivery service :))  Food is always fresh. Their rolls are innovative and filled with amazing ingredients but they are enormous!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. After ordering two sushi entrées to-go, I was told it would take 30 minutes to prepare. I was ok with that and took my son for a walk. We came back 30 minutes later and it still wasn't ready. They said it would take another 10 minutes. Well, the clock kept ticking and 15 minutes later  I still had no food. Now I had a cold, hungry baby crying in the stroller and me beyond angry that this is taking so long. I didn't live in the neighborhood and was staying at a hotel nearby. I went inside and asked if it was ready yet and they said no. I demanded to have my order canceled and my credit card refunded. Luckily they obliged.  No one should have to wait 45+ minutes for 2 orders."}
{"text":"I thought it was good.  We had carry out so I can't speak for the service inside the place - but the food was fresh and good.  Be sure to get a combo type meal - otherwise you'll spend $50 on 2 (albeit tasty) rolls.  Note that we were from out of town so I cannot speak on the consistency - but based on what I experienced it was quite good."}
{"text":"Very basic over priced nothing special sushis. First off, I has their miso soup because it came with the beef bulgogi and there was so much msg in it that I was thirsting for water literally all day. Be careful how much to take of that soup, it's also not worth it there's no tofu, seaweed and not even scallions for freshness and taste.  Next we had the sashimi platter, the salmon was decent but I definitely had a lot better. Had the tuna and it wasn't good, the piece didn't melt like butter when put in your mouth. The sashimi was edible but nothing special.  We ordered some rolls salmon roll, snowman roll, golden dragon roll and something else. The rolls weren't seasoned and differentiated enough because they all had the basic avocado, salmon, cucumber and tempura. they think they can just put a bunch of ingredients and make a big thick roll and sprinkle some cool stuff on it like I see in other restaurants. There's no originality to this place and nothing mind blowing about it. Not to mention that the price is pretty darn expensive for something that I really wasn't happy with overall. I got four rolls, sashimi and a beef platter for $120. It's decent, I ate my food but will not be coming back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff. Amazing sushi! I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's pretty small place so it does get quite busy fast.  We did call ahead so our table was ready when we got there. We got one of the private rooms which is pretty nice to have.  The service was quick and super friendly.  The food was quick and tasty.  The rolls themselves were rather large.  So pretty fair considering the prices.  The place was fairly clean except for the two flies that kept on visiting our table.  All in all, I'd probably go back only if I were in the area.  But probably wouldn't make a special trip there to go there."}
{"text":"It advertised as being kid friendly, so I brought the family including my 18 month toddler.  Upon arriving we were informed they don't have a high chair.   Kind of disappointing....we left.  I give them 3 stars because the staff was polite about it, and I have no idea how the food is."}
{"text":"Fave Sushi spot in the whole Toronto, I always eat at random places here and there. I dont usually remember the names of the restaurant UNLESS it was amazing or terrible.  This place makes delish, huge rolls. So many types of rolls, Skydome, Lobster, etc lmao i suck at names but they have tons of options I havent seen at many other restaurants. I uploaded a photo that my friend and I were sharing. I wish i remembered the names because those rolls was amazing. Miso Soup was perfect aswell but I dont think they have spring rolls? Im obsessed with them haha  The location is kindof hidden, towards the Rogers Centre, past the street light going southeast? The restaurant is cute. It pretty busy, summer patio is great, but I think management needs to expand the size of their store because its quite small and there is a bit of waiting involved depending on the time of the day.   Whenever I am near spadina/bremner/union area. Be prepared to see me there LOL"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and the quantities were nuts. A group of 3 of us ordered a combination platter which showed up on a freaking BOAT with all these different types of fish and it was all delicious. If I lived here I would go ham on this place. Only con is that it's a bit small but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Reliable sushi and great gyoza, if a little low on ambiance. Had Chirashi main - very generous portion of fish. Extra star for accommodating service - asked for half bottle of plonk, but was mistakenly served a half glass because server thought that was what I asked for."}
{"text":"A little on the costly side, but def worth the $. My fav is the noodle soup & seaweed salad with fresh avocado every time! Fav sushi place hands down!"}
{"text":"Small place serving pretty typical fare: various sushi rolls, teriyaki dishes, etc. They have some unusual roll choices like beefsteak and mushroom sushi as well as more traditional ones. We tried the lobster roll (good but not outstanding), the beefsteak and mushroom (disappointing and fairly tasteless) and the chicken teriyaki (fine but nothing unusual). Staff were friendly and reasonably prompt, prices also seemed average for the area. Overall seemed acceptable and convenient, but not a place I'd go out of your way for."}
{"text":"This is not my first time here but my first check in. What I love about this place, is the presentation and quality of the food. Whether it is sashimi, one of their many sushi rolls or soups, you cannot go wrong with this location. I can only recommend it to anyone and everyone I have brought here loves the place as much as I do."}
{"text":"Been here three times, and first two times were amazing but the last visit (on July 26, 2014) they were definitely off their game. We always do take out since we live almost right next door and usually have their small sushi and maki party platter (great selection of high quality fish for a decent price) tempura shrimp (not too greasy and perfectly crispy) and spider roll (could do with a bit more soft shell crab in the roll, but still delicious).  The quality of their fish is superb and definitely worth the value.    But on my last visit, it was for lunch, they over did it with the rice and the fish wasn't as fresh as we expected.  The rice for the nigiri was way too much - like what they give you at AYCE restaurants to fill you up.  And some of the fish just tasted off.  We were thoroughly disappointed.  Will give it another try in hopes that it was one of their off days."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out a new sushi place near my downtown apartment, so we decided to check out Mi-Ne Sushi.  This sushi restaurant is a small but cute atmosphere, with friendly staff and yummy Japanese food.  Also, it is located right near the Skydome and ACC (in case you are looking for sushi instead of hot dogs and fries)  Once my friend and I got comfy in a booth, we opened up the menu and it was HUGE!   They had over 20 special sushi rolls with tons of delicious and interesting ingredients, 20 maki and hand roll options and almost 15 sushi combos to choose from.  This selection alone was impressive because it could definitely cater to anyone's sushi tastebuds.  For our dinner, my friend and I split the following rolls (which were all delicious and DID NOT dissapoint):  - Crunch Roll (Sashimi, avocado and crab in a crispy batter) - Dynamite Roll - Kamikaze Roll (Tuna, cucumber, tempura batter in a spicy sauce) - Spicy Salmon Roll - Hamachi Maki  The specialty rolls are HUGE and come with 8-10 pieces per roll, while the classics like spicy salmon roll came with 6 pieces per roll.  The specialty rolls are more expensive, ranging from $10 to $15 but they are HUGE and have so many ingredients in it.  The regular rolls are typical priced betwee $4 and $8.  Top off a meal here with their soothing green tea and you will be in heaven!"}
{"text":"In a word, excellent.  We got home from a 10km walk, if I could review a walk, it would've gotten 0/5 stars.  Seriously don't do it, ever.  Ok, I'm really digressing from my original purpose here.  We were pretty hungry when we got in and decided to order sushi, much to our disappointment we were unable to find a place that delivered to us, and then we came across Mi-Ne Sushi.  The girl who answered the phone was very friendly and helpful when we told her we couldn't find their menu on the website, and when we placed our order she was spot on with respect to estimating the delivery time.  The food itself, was excellent, by far some of the best spicy tuna I've ever had, and the edamame was steamed to perfection.  It had just the right amount of salt and still remained crunchy and hot.  My ONLY complaint, and the reason I'm giving this 4 stars out of 5, is I had to wait an hour for my food and well, I'm impatient.  ;)"}
{"text":"Wanted to get a quick bite to eat prior to the baseball game, so we popped into Mi-Ne.  The place is pretty small with maybe 10 tables.  We were immediately greeted and shown to a table.  The menu is quite long and there is a large variety of sushi items to select from.    We ordered a couple of roles and within no time those were delivered to the table.  The rolls were large and the nice part is that they were mostly filling (ie: very little rice on the outside).  Everything was fresh and just the way it should be.  Both the rolls ordered were very flavorful.  Our server was back several times to check on us and refill water/tea.    Overall, it was a little pricier than some other sushi places, but maybe by 15%.  The ingredients were fresh and the fusion of different items made the rolls really good !  Service was very good too.  I'm definitely coming back when in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for pick up and dining in. Always a positive experience.   As other yelpers have mentioned the sushi does tend to be a bit pricier than other places but the quality is worth it.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is super convenient because it is just downstairs from my condo. The food is always delicious and my husband and I are regular patrons. We always order the Spider Roll Sushi combo and Spicy Chicken Bento. The restaurant is not good for larger groups though so do not bring more than 4 people. We however noticed recent decrease in food quality. My Spider Roll soft shell crab was off and I was offered a replacement with a menu given to me by the waitress. However, after I had chosen, she said I cannot have what I chose and can only have limited things. So what's the point in choosing? Regardless we will return but I just wanted you to know that as a customer, that is not an acceptable answer."}
{"text":"Was very crowded at that time, but we managed to get a table.  The sushis were very well presented and fresh (most important). We had to spend quite a while choosing from such a huge selection of menu.   I would recommend this place as one of the better Japanese restaurant outside Toronto."}
{"text":"Stunning food! Fresh fish, great quality. The detailing in their food is beautiful and you know it is made with love.. I find myself craving their food lol... the servers are very pleasant and the environment is very inviting I personally like their booths."}
{"text":"what a nice little sushi place next to city place.  a very clean and bright atmosphere.  very friendly service.  their selection of specialty maki sushi is enormous with a fresh selection of sashimi.  the prices here are a tad high for a sushi place, but in my opinion, it's well worth it.  i'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Just had MiNe sushi for lunch today but have been here many times before as it is one of my fav sushi places in the city. The quality is always very good (moist, well textured and flavourful) and the prices are reasonable.  I had the lunch combo 6 spicy tuna and 6 spicy salmon w/ miso soup and salad. Total was just over $14 with taxes which is roughly the same or cheaper cost as sushi from the sobeys closeby which is not very good.  I really love the miso soup here as it isn't salty like most places and they add some enoki mushrooms too it.  Definitely recommend checking them out if you are looking for somewhere to eat in the area."}
{"text":"Flies everywhere - sushi rolls sub par - not fresh,  the rice wasn't cooked correctly making a sloppy roll. I wouldn't come back.  Service was fine. But really take a pass on this spot."}
{"text":"Service is kinda slow because I think there was one server who served the whole restaurant. The tobiko salad is very good. Their rolls are mediocre and not that tasty. Its just an OK Japanese restaurant. Nothing to call home about."}
{"text":"After having lived in Japan for a year, I'm constantly searching for delicious sushi.  Mi-Ne provides just that! The rolls are large, fresh, and delicious! I'm a fan of the Orangeville roll. Although pricier than most sushi places around T.O. they do deliver quality sushi. I have eaten in and and taken out and it's delicious either way.  The restaurant itself is extremely small so you are lucky if you get a table! Definitely worth a try for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of sushi. One day, the craving hit; need sushi now. Quickly jumping on Yelp, I locate the closest joint to me: Mi-Ne Sushi. I walk over with a quickened pace, the sushi craving must be satisfied. Walking in, I see several tables and a few private booths. The place is small, cute, and very clean. I am quickly met by the hostess and explain that I am in dire need of seeing their take out menu (which happens to be the same as their sit-in menu). I have a seat and look through a long menu full of what look like seriously delicious things. I finally choose and wait a few minutes for everything to be put together. Before I leave with my super aromatic meal, EVERYONE says 'bye' to me; even the Sushi Chefs (who always wear ties under their getup). To keep this very long story not too much longer, I get home only to find 100% craving satisfaction.   The problem is the craving quickly returns, as it always does for things so delicious. :'(  Fave's off the menu: Miso Soup, Chicken Katsu Dinner, and Spicy Tuna Roll mmmm...... Warning: At the time I am writing this, their site does not reflect their entire menu."}
{"text":"This Sushi restaurant is very conveniently located if you like sushi and live in the City Place condos. The sushi isn't too bad, but beware that they seem to add a light dusting of granulated garlic to all of their sushi. I can never figure out why.    The restaurant is quite small and the staff seem pleasant. The service is pretty quick. They often serve a complimentary Miso soup and salad with your order. Both are pretty standard in taste and presentation.   You can eat-in or take-out from this place, which seems to be pretty standard. The restaurant has a few booths and tables and can likely seat about 20-25 people.   While the prices here are not too high I would say for the quality of the sushi you can certainly find cheaper places around."}
{"text":"Here's the deal... Great (pricy) food but socially challenged waitresses. Difficult to communicate with and VERY slow service! I continue to go back for only one reason BEST sushi I've eaten ."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi in the city. You would think because it's across from the Rogers Center they may not focus on quality since it would be busy regardless due to location, but it will blow your mind. The maki rolls are fresh and without fail delicious. I find any excuse under the sun to go here. Some favourites are shrimp tempura roll, yam tempura roll, spicy salmon, and spicy tuna. The simple maki are my favourite, but their complex rolls are also good. ie the lobster roll (you get an entire lobster roll) and the dynamite roll! It's not as cheap as some places in the city, but the extra money is worth it and for a nice dinner it's better priced than many places. Expect to pay about about $20-$25 per person, more if you're drinking. The service is also wonderful, and the restaurant is small and inviting. One warning: there isn't the best ventilation in the restaurant, so without fail you will smell like tempura when you leave. As long as you don't have anywhere important to go after where that be an issue you're fine! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Great place. Always fresh Sushi. I am a regular and I have never had a bad experience. I love their sashimi the most."}
{"text":"The food was good. Was our first time in Toronto. We were looking for Japanese restaurant. Everything was fresh. My kids loved rolls. I will back for sure.  recommend."}
{"text":"I am so glad that Mi-Ned opened another location here especially since it's so close to where I live. The other location in Richmond Hill (Yonge/Elginmills) was one of my top 5 Sushi Restaurants and now I can enjoy it close to home.  Apparently the owner from that location moved to this downtown one.  It's a very small but a cozy place w/ several booths and open area with pretty comfy chairs.  It's owned by Korean people and they were playing all my fav. tracks of K-pop.  Smallest sushi bar I've been but trust me, their sushi/sashimi are one of the best!  I went with the group of 4 on a Thursday night around at 7pm. It was fully packed but we were sitted after 10 minutes of waiting.   Salad- Fresh, Very good as expected  Spicy Seafood Dinner - Grilled seafood (mussel, shrimp, white fish etc) on a sizzling plate with Korean hot sauce on top served with rice for two: This was an okay dish..I mean I can easily make this at home so it was nice special. The servers gave us extra rice as there are four of us but I probably rather have sashimi platter.  Galbi- Marinated Korean-style rib on sizzling plate: Again, being a Korean, I've had better bbq ones at home..my friend really liked this so we ordered it anyway. He loved it so it's all goood but bit fattening and not well-done for my taste.  Kamikaze Roll- Always good, bit of crunch and fish  Philadelphia Roll- This I liked, the cream cheese block could have been a bit smaller but the stuffings blended very well together.  They serve you a already-cut orange as complimentary dessert for each person.   Think we ended up paying $20/person. Not the cheapest sushi place but quality is definitely there. We sat right by the sushi bar and man all the plates that were being made loooked so good and fresh. Next time, I am definitely getting more sashimi and maki though. :)  Service: Good, friendly, quick  Overall: My new fav, down-the-street sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is a one cute little place! Where \"little\" is a keyword.  Unfortunately, they are really tiny - there is no chance to drop-in except for the dead hours, and I personally had difficulties to get to my seat even though I am relatively small-frame. Those booths are cozy, but really-really small!  Otherwise, service was excellent - polite, useful, fast. Better that at Kokyo, which effectively makes it one of the best in the whole Downtown Toronto. Food quality was exceptional, and the only reason for me not to give this place a five stars rating is that painful lack of space.  Prices are right, portions are huge, menu is elaborate and quality of ingredients and resulting food is an absolute A-grade. The only suggestion to them will be to have an option for a smaller rolls - those huge ones look impressive but take quite a bit of effort to eat them in one piece. :-)  I am definitely a fan of Mi-Ne Sushi and encourage anyone to try them - at least as a take-out location, if there will be no table available when you'll pass by."}
{"text":"The donburi sushi salad bowl is $19 + tax with a \"spicy\" sauce on the side (it's not spicy). I felt it was pricey.   Not too much seating inside. There was a patio but it was empty on a Sat afternoon (hot summer day) even though it's shaded.   It's a great healthy meal for take out & comes with white rice on the side.   I was pleasantly surprised when I brought it home at how many small pieces of fish there were, mainly salmon and tuna. But keep in mind it came to $21 including taxes. Not sure there was THAT much sushi on the salad. You can get AYCE for almost that price   I ate the entire thing including the rice and the sauce and found it to be filling (in a good way).   Would I get take out from there again? Yes because it's convenient.   Would I order the same dish? Yes because it's healthy and a decent portion (& one of the least expensive sashimi type meals there). The price  is why I gave them only 4/5 stars as it didn't taste any more fresh or exceptional than other 4* sushi places & because the sauce was not spicy (but still tasted too just not what I was expecting).  It would be nice if they had a customer loyalty program."}
{"text":"I'm a little sad to give them this rating but they are nowhere near the quality of their Markham location.  I visited here as a group of four on a Saturday around noon and we got the slowest service ever. The best part? We were the only table there! We ordered 3 orders of California rolls, one of their special rolls and a chirashi din and it took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  The food was also not the freshest. The cucumber in the California rolls were so dry. The fish was not very fresh at all either. Strangely they were also preparing a bunch of tempura shrimp while we were there which means they probably wont't be so fresh when someone else orders a dynamite roll or tempura.   I love Mi-Ne in Markham and was so sad that this one was so inconsistent with their other location."}
{"text":"I cannot give an accurate review on the food. I live (according to yelp and google map) 1km away but because I am literally 1 step west of Bathurst I am outside of their delivery. I understand delivery zones and she did give me the option to pick up. I just fail to see lost business due to such a small issue. You've lost the potential of a customer who lives 1km away - I'll just try somewhere else that has a broader delivery zone as I don't feel like carrying my food home with me"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto for a conference. We were looking for a good sushi place and the bartender at the renaissance recommended this place. Unfortunately the power went out right before we got here.   The rest of the experience was fantastic. They let us sit outside and provided edimame, beer, sake, and very very good sushi. I live in DC and used to live in San Francisco and the fish here compares to some of the best I have had.   I'll come here again when I come back to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Authentic Japanese restaurant with fresh sashimi!  Mi-Ne is a great neighbourhood Japanese restaurant with quality food at a decent price.   We have been to the downtown, Markham and Aurora location, I find the quality is pretty constant at each location.   Their specialty rolls starts at $15 for 9 pieces. For a family of 8, we paid $150 for their love boat combo, 2 specialty rolls and 2 yaki udon. We were all pretty satisfied.  The yaki udon is really good, we order it everytime."}
{"text":"Best.Rolls.ever! They have a huge selections of specialty rolls ranging $8-$14! They were surprisingly filling! My date had the spicy chicken dinner and I had the Alaskan roll! Will def come back try all their rolls!"}
{"text":"Great place for just about anything Asian cuisine. Had some sushi and bulgogi and both were wonderful. Our waitress was the only one at the time and she was insanely cheerful!  She alone made this a great place. The great food just put it on top"}
{"text":".I went here because it's close to my home at Spadina and Front. I have said this before sushi places are hit and miss and unfortunately this place was a miss for me. Prices are a little high for what you get and the sashimi just didn't have the fresh or wow factor for. Service was below average and I think the only reason this place stays in business is because of the Rogers Centre. If you are craving sushi or more importantly sashimi, avoid this place."}
{"text":"3.5 star.   Really delicious big signature rolls here and the sashimi dinner was great too.   It was a bit of a sh1t show dining here right before a Jays game, as it's located directly across from the Dome. There were quite a few tables of 905ers pre-drinking (sake) before the baseball game, which caused some disruption with our service, but overall the staff handled everything rather brilliantly. Clap clap.  Small patio (4-5 tables) and equally small (6-8 tables) interior."}
{"text":"I love pretty close to Mi-Ne Sushi but I've never bothered to eat here because the prices seem pretty outrageous. Today, I had some sushi craving and no one to eat with so I dragged myself here to order take-out. I got the Maki Set A which included dynamite roll and california roll with salad and miso soup. The total was a little over $19 after tax.  The miso soup is really good. Even had some enoki mushrooms, a little cold because they leave the takeout soup outside in the container in preparation in case someone orders (not after they order).  I like that they separate the dressing with the salad for the takeout.  The ROLLS are capitalized because they are GIANT. I guess they should be since they are almost $5 a piece, but a bit bland.  The spicy dynamite roll (no extra charge for spicy) has salmon in there--I wasn't expecting that. But the spiciness didn't stand out. The california roll ($1 extra if you want spicy) is good except it was rolled in black sesame--not a huge fan of the sesame.  The service is great and unlike what people said, this isn't another Korean restaurant, but a Japanese restaurant as the servers, the chefs all speak in Japanese to each other.  It's an expensive place and definitely not worth the price, but I'll probably end up having to come back just because it's so ridiculously close."}
{"text":"I love mi-ne very happy to have it here in Toronto as I've always loved it back when I was in Richmond Hill. Their rolls are great and they don't cheap out on ingredients. Fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Went here last night with the wife and a few friends. I had the Mi Ne sushi set which I believe included 13 pieces of sushi and 6 maki as well as salad and a miso soup. The salad was expectedly small and the dressing was a standard sweet Japanese dressing that was delicious. Miso soup was excellent and I could have easily had several bowls. While I enjoy the real deal sushi with wasabi in the nigiri, I thought the chef went a little heavy on the wasabi. The fish seemed of decent quality but I've had better. Overall I was satisfied and for $25 I left full but not stuffed and think I got my money's worth.   I have also been here once in the past and had a bento box for lunch that was well worth it. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been in the area now for about 4 years. I've frequented this place ever since. Love the service. The servers are polite, friendly, available and always get your order right. 19/20 times the service and food is timely, very few exceptions where I've felt I was waiting too long. The sushi itself is of good quality whether you're speaking of sashimi, regular rolls or their specialty rolls. Keep in mind their specialty rolls are large! Also I truly enjoy their mushroom soup and their sake."}
{"text":"MI NE sushi is one of my favorite restaurants uptown in Richmond Hill. It's unfortunate that this particular downtown location doesn't live up to its sister restaurant's reputation, in terms of sushi quality, atmosphere, and service.  The sashimi and rolls are average, and it's not as fresh compared to other restaurants. Seating is quite cramped, there's the occasional fly with the door open, and the washroom is crammed in the back with storage.   What was most displeasing was the service which is extremely slow in the two times I've been here, and so much so that I will never dine here again. They had the nerve to slip in a 20% service charge for a fast casual sushi restaurant, with no mention of this from the waiter. If the service been satisfactory, then I would have had no problem with this, but waiting 45 mins from ordering for a sushi boat is unreasonable. The surcharge really put me over the edge.  The staff pretends as if this is a high end restaurant, but it really falls short and diners should be aware. Avoid the frustration, save your money, and treat yourself at a better a la carte restaurant in the city!"}
{"text":"Moved downtown from Markham, where sushi joints are dime a dozen... Mi-Ne Sushi rivals the best of them in Toronto.   Service is excellent. Quality of the food is great. Outdoor seating during the summer months is a huge plus. Menu is lengthy and have everything you'd expect a Japanese restaurant to have  Shared a Orangeville roll and a set dinner. Only complaint was that tuna sashimi that came with the set dinner were the smallest I've seen. Other than that.. food was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Lots of choices here and their portions are big! Although it is a little pricier than your usual Japanese restaurant, it is reasonable for the quality and quantity! I always recommend coming here to my friends."}
{"text":"Great sushi place with notably polite service. I really enjoyed the sushi pizza, something I wouldn't normally order but devoured here. Would recommend if you're in the area and want something a little better than the typical touristy dumps nearby."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the service and the fresh food.  A very small place so I would recommend getting a reservation.  I didn't drive there so I didn't require parking but this location does not have a parking lot. The Rogers centre is across the street so if you're driving, and it so happens to be an event night, you may end up having to pay an event rate for parking.  Otherwise, everything was great. Nothing really blew my mind which is why I gave it 4 stars -- but I do intend on going sometime again to give it a deeper try."}
{"text":"I cant decide what it was about the sushi...  Well on the good side, they threw us a bonus piece on every plate which was a great gesture but the sushi tasted so bland that I could really enjoy it. There was no hint of a fish smell or taste but it almost tasted like it was flash freezed beyond the point of saving any flavor."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the sushi here was above average. Only 8 pieces of the dynamite roll and I was beyond being full.   However, the service is a different story. After first reading the reviews, Mi-Ne appeared to be a comfortable location that was close to where I worked. Upon arrival, we quickly realized how cramped up the space was. My friends and I had to squeeze sit within the boundaries of the booth, which was not exactly what I expected from this sushi place.   We waited nearly 30 minutes for someone to take our order. When we signaled for them to come, they said that they would be there shortly, and not arrive within 10 minutes. We signaled several of their employees, but they appeared too frazzled to even come and stop by our booth.  Nonetheless, the food quality was still on par. I would have liked to not be starving prior to the arrival of our food."}
{"text":"I've been to Mi-Ne a few times for lunch. It's one of the few sit-down sushi restaurants in the area. It's my go-to place in this area when I have time to sit for lunch. I've ordered a few different dishes, but my favorite so far is the chirashi bowl. It contains thick pieces of salmon, tuna, butterfish, a shrimp, a few pieces of avocado, and just the right amount of rice. It also comes with a cup of miso soup and a salad. Their nigiri sushi isn't overstuffed with rice, but has a good ratio of rice to fish. Service has always been great, even when it's busy."}
{"text":"I  like this place. it's in the area, and i used tof requent it often with my bf when he lived in Toronto. it wasn't the cheapest place, but not super expensive either. maybe $2 more than a cheapo downtown joint.  it's small with both tables and booths, the service is very friendly and quite hospitable. the food is great, i got salmon sashimi (sooo good!), and i've pretty much tried half of their rolls off the menu. good stuff everytime i go and i've had sushi in in japan. i haven't trie dtheir cooked items b/c i'm a sashimi/roll person. but you can't really go wrong with this place if you're in the area, great for a date and then after you can go to The spot next door for dessert if you wanted to (although i wouldn't recc it, b/c their cofee sucks)."}
{"text":"I've given this a couple of l tries while in the area based on reviews but am always disappointed.  There is way too much rice and far too little fish.  I have to cut the rice in half to get it wrangled down to normal size.  The fish itself is cut thin and wasn't particularly fresh.   If you love sushi rice, you've found nirvana.  Otherwise, venture elsewhere."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and attentive. Miso was delicious. The sashimi was good. I found the Maki rolls too large and awkward to eat. Sushi should be about balance and presentation. Maybe I've become a sushi snob but I didn't find that the rice tasted fresh on the night I was there. From other reviews, I thought this would be a be a good pick, maybe I hit it on an off night."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying I hardly ever do reviews unless I have an exceptionally good experience with the business. I came here today for the first time with my girlfriend (despite living right beside Rogers Center) and I was surprised how this place delivered such quality food and awesome customer service. Maybe it's because this place is not located in a mainstream area (like Queen West). Our waitress followed up with us once a while to make sure we were doing okay and the food we ordered lived up to our expectations. Although this place is a bit pricey compared to the usual sushi restaurants you find along Queen Street, they offer generous portions and definitely higher quality production. You can tell by the culinary that the chef actually put the time into making every dish! I will definitely be coming back here when I get sushi cravings, especially when I live 5 minutes away!"}
