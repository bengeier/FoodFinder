{"text":"First time at Kebabstop in Oakville. It is located within an industrial area of Oakville and it is tucked away from the street. By the way, the address listed on Yelp for this place is incorrect: the actual address is 1260 Speers Road.   We ordered the koobideh & joojeh. Both meals were extremely fresh and delicious! The beef kabob was super tender and full of spices and the rice was just pure perfection. Why? The rice was cooked just right and tossed in a little butter, which made the rice very moist and just amazing! The chicken kabob was very delicious as well. Both meals came with two tomatoes each, broiled and yummy! While I highly rate their food, I feel the prices are a bit much. The joojeh was $10 and koobideh $9. They don't come with salads either. Want a better value with just as good food? Try Shahyad Kababsara in Mississauga! However if you want to stay local and eat authentic persian food, Kebabstop is a good option!"}
{"text":"Family owned business for quick persian fix. The rice is impeccable, the Kebab is so juicy, and the Barg; literally melts in your mouth.   Amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. New location is a little smaller but the food is still awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent. I've been eating here for over a decade and the food is exceptional. The owners are really friendly people. You can't go wrong with their food. I've been eating the same dish for the entire time because it's so good I don't even want to try any of their other dishes. They have some tables to eat in and they also do take out. I can't say enough good things about them."}
{"text":"For sure they make the best Persian food in the whole west end. I've been a customer of theirs for many years now and I would strongly suggest their food to everyone!"}
{"text":"Meet up with a friend for dinner based on a recommendation. They serve halal food.  This place operated by a perisan family.  The food is authentic to what you would get back in Iran.  I ordered the kebab dinner, which came with two kebabs, rice and salad all for $11.  It was a hearty meal with the kebabs cooked perfectly.  My salad was limp and my rice was a bit dry.  We closed off the meal with balakava.  Standard fare, nothing special.  The sad part was they serve this great perisan tea but we did not give them enough notice to start brewing the tea as they were closing for the evening.  Check them out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is great. Their wraps are a great alternative to shawarmas.   I just feel that they are slightly bit overpriced (hence the 4 stars)"}
{"text":"Awe always eat here great food, take out specials also amazing for having guest over. Thank you kebab stop"}
{"text":"I have always really liked this place, however, my wife and I went for lunch on the 21st at about 11:30 and were the only ones in the restaurant with the owner working at the counter.  While the food has generally been quite good, the service and the price weren't. This time, the food was alright. Just your standard Persian fare.  We sat in and no water was offered, he seemed like he didn't really want customers in at the time and a request for hot sauce seemed to have been a little too much for him. We certainly won't be going back. I have posted photos of the menu.   Price: 1 order of Vaziri shared between two people $18.05 after tax.   Side note: we were regulars of this place when they had a location at the 4th line / speers intersection and went many times. Something has changed that seems to make this place quite unwelcoming."}
