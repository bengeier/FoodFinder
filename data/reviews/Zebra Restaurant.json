{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with an out of town guest Wednesday night. We had Duck cooked two ways with root vegetables and Brussel sprouts. Our meal was excellent. The duck was cooked perfectly. We also enjoyed a nice bottle of wine. The staff was great."}
{"text":"This is the go-to place to celebrate special events for my husband and I. We have dined here numerous times and each time exceeds our expectations a bit more!   Chef Alexander is very accomidating, I have a gluten allergy and he is willing to make changes to accomidate my allergy for any dish. I love that I can eat here and have no worries about will I be sick tomorrow?!    The menu changes seasonally and there are always daily specials, which I highly reccommend. Several times we have dined at Zebra and the fish special is something that the Chef has caught himself on the coast. We have tried numerous appetizers but I always gravitate toward the mussels with kaffir lime, my husband loves the charcuterie plate. As far as entrees, we have had sea badd, shark, waygu beef, lamb, and scallops, all dishes have been cooked and seasoned to perfection. We never miss a chance to split a creme brulee, and Zebra's is fabulous. The souffle is excellent according to my husband, and don't miss the salted caramel ice cream if it is featured.  The wine list is extensive, the staff is very knowledgeable about pairings. Although I am yet to attend one, Zebra offers a wine tasting on Fridays and seems to be very popular as we have arrived near the end of the tastings.  The service is top notch and not over bearing. Zebra is truley a gem within the Queen City and should not be missed!"}
{"text":"Went here for a pre-valentine's day dinner on Friday the 13th. 4-course menu for $85 per person.   The restaurant crammed as many 2-tops as possible very close to one another violating any possible privacy.   Service was nothing but transactional, think diner style. We felt rushed towards the end. With two dinners, a few glasses of wine, and a 20% tip the bill was north of $270 for a couple, and based on the quality of food (not bad, but nothing to write home about), mediocre service, I don't think this place is worth ever going back to."}
{"text":"Took mom there for dinner yesterday. Great experience. Very good food. And the waiter is super nice. I got the groupon but still ended up paying over 60 but its definitely worth it.   Accidentally ordered the bottled Italian spring water. Thought its free. lol~~~ Why would it be? Love the bottle so asked waiter if I can take it home. Answer is YES. May use it as vase in the future.  We skipped the appetizer but got the mushroom soup. Totally loved it. Like the texture. Creamy but not too much. Light and tasty.  Entree for mom is Main lobster. Very fresh. Food amount is decent.  I had the lamp. Made this decision because quite a few yelper said great thing about this dish. Totally enjoyed it. Very tender.  Melt in my mouth. We took waiter's suggestion and ordered the chocolate souffle. Maybe Im not a souffle person. Not a big fan of it. But the table next to us cleaned the whole thing up. So my opinion may not be that helpful.  Overall, great dinning experience. Will go back if they offer another groupon deal some day."}
{"text":"I went to Zebra with a few foodie friends who are close to a couple of the chefs. We got to sample a variety of wines, appetizers, and desserts, and I have to admit I was impressed with almost everything they put in front of me. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the entree--it was a braised rabbit dish that was tough and overcooked (though the sauce was delectable). On a normal visit I might have sent it back (not something I do at mid-grade restaraunts, but when  you're paying the big bucks...), but given all of the free food and wine we had been consuming I felt I should let it slide.   The atmosphere was great, intimate yet charged with energy. I definitely plan on going back for a normal visit soon."}
{"text":"I went to Zebra for my birthday dinner, something special.  It was a bit hard to find, as its in an office building.  It was like I was trying to find the door to my dentist office.  What's nice is you get extras in-between courses.  We received a warm sun-dried tomato bisque shooter after our bread and before our entree.  We didn't order dessert and they gave us coconut macaroons.  I really like those little touches.  My husband ordered the Duck Two Ways with cognac soaked carrots and fingerling potatoes.  He normally hates everything, he absolutely loved this dish. I ordered the Steak Frites with Pommes Frites cooked in duck fat which I was excited to try, it's been such a craze lately.  I ordered the steak medium and it came out very very rare.  I so wanted to give a higher rating but I expect a well cooked steak at this caliber restaurant. I don't send food back, ever.  I ate two bites and the fries which were delicious and I took the steak home and cooked it thoroughly for my next nights dinner.  Would have been 5 stars perhaps if I ordered anything else but steak."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The service was disappointing at best.  The staff was so overwhelmed we were barely spoken to.  The manager seemed more than impressed with himself, and arrogant.  I do not dine out to be ignored or spoken down to. Even though the meal was outstanding the poor service and rude management will keep me from returning."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Zebra just over a year ago, I wasn't sure I would return. The waiter was just ok; he didn't know where the sea food was sourced,wasn't sure what ingredients were in what components. Then the food other than the truffle soup was just ok.   That changed on Friday when I gave Zebra another shot. I went with my boyfriend and we had a wonderful experience. There were little things here and there that keep me from the 5 stars: I wanted the lobster but they were out and it wasn't until I ordered it that I was informed of this, I would have liked a little more pickled cabbage with my pork bell appetizer, the lights randomly flickered on and off for the first 30 mintues i was there etc. But at the end of the night, i had a great experience, left full of really good food, and had a great time with my boyfriend.   The wine list is extensive for Charlotte. And the suggestions from my waiter were good. I LOVED the pork belly appetizer and also the mushroom truffle soup. I had the lamb entree which was delicous (and I would like to mention that I am VERY picky with lamb so I was hesitant to order it). I was happily surprised to find some goat cheese under the lamb, but I would have been happier if there had been a little more. My boyfriend had the sole which was also good. Again, a little more of the cranberry so that there was enough for a little to accompany each bite would have been nice, but without it, it was still very good.   We didn't have dessert so I can't comment on that, but overall i had a great time and will make sure to return."}
{"text":"I have been to Zebra's many times for breakfast and have always enjoyed the atmosphere and food. I can impress clients and have a great meal to start the day.    Just tonight we decided to eat dinner there (for the first time in 10 years) and I felt compelled to write a review. A couple recent reviews were negative so I was a bit reluctant to try it for dinner, even though I had never had a bad experience for breakfast before.  Our dinner tonight was amazing! I had the NY strip with fries and my wife had the lamb tenderloin. The food was excellent and the service was perfect. Another guest with us had the beef tenderloin and said it was incredible.   For dessert we split 2 of the coffee souffle with carmel sauce and it was the perfect end to a real feast. The dessert was not only tasty, but the presentation was top notch.   I highly recommend Zebra's for an excellent dining experience!"}
{"text":"I pretty surprised at some of the mediocre reviews.  I had a very pleasant dining experience at Zebra.  Yes, it is pretty pricey, but it is a nice place to go to for a special occasion or a romantic date night.  The food was one of the best I've had in Charlotte so far and the service was top notch.  Perhaps the restaurant, like most, has its good and bad moments. Luckily, I dined during a good one."}
{"text":"Excellent service quality local farm food. Always fresh . Very unique menu!! Lots of delicious choices on the menu . It changes regularly. I have come here for lunch as well . Never a disappointment"}
{"text":"My husband took me there for our 26th wedding anniversary.  We started off with one waiter and then changed to another. He wasn't very friendly.b Scallops were cold. Lamb was cold. Very pricey. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Zebra Restaurant & Wine Bar  Well, I've been here 3 times. Here's a brief summary of each visit.  Visit #1   I had been given a Gift Certificate to use (thank goodness because I would have been ultra bummed to spend my own money this time!) and went with a girlfriend for brunch.  First impression: It was cold. It was the dead of winter, ice outside and they sat us, in an empty restaurant, by the glass door. Bad form. Our waiter was a super chatty guy who kept nudging his way into our conversation. At one point I had asked my friend where Purdue is and before she could answer he, who had been sweeping around a table next to ours, chimed in. Strike two. Our breakfast came out and it was ok, not impressive though. The potato cake I got was most likely made the day before and reheated, the bacon was cold and they were out of all but one kind of bread for toast. The eggs were cooked nicely but the grits were too heavy.  Not terrible but also, not great.  Take two (a few days later, actually): I went with my husband for our wedding anniversary lunch. It was nice, quiet but there were customers around and this time we sat in the main dining room where it was nice and warm.  I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Chicken with angel hair pasta and red pepper coulis. Oh. My. Gosh. I practically licked the plate. Seriously, it was that good. The chicken was perfectly cooked, moist, crunchy on the outside.. the pasta had a nice bite and was tossed in a lovely cream sauce and the pepper coulis was fresh and bright. I LOVED it.  I tried my husband's dish, which I can't even remember now.. and it was good, but nothing like mine. For dessert I had creme brulee which was also lovely. By the time we finished eating I had forgotten it was our Anniversary and that I had disliked the breakfast I had there previously.  Third: I went with a friend for dinner and it was just perfect. The room temperature was adequate, the wine was smooth, the filet was at the perfect temperature. It was a great meal.   I think, perhaps, Zebra is a little pricey for it's quality but it's in a rich area so it's to be expected. Don't go unless you can afford to spend some real money. Make a reservation for dinner, for lunch it wouldn't be necessary unless it's the weekend. I don't recommend bringing kids there, but it would be good for groups. In fact, when we were there the first time there was a baby shower in the main room.   I DO recommend this place. It's worth the trip, at least I'm 85% sure it is."}
{"text":"I made a reservation online for Valentine's weekend. I was very much looking forward to the experience as I'd heard good things about the upscale place. I had intended to use a Groupon to pay for part of the meal, as there were no restrictions listed on the Groupon - nor on Zebra's website, or their reservation host website. When we arrived at the restaurant we were greeted with a sign alerting us that they would not be accepting any promotional discounts of any kind - i.e. Groupons. Realizing that we intended to limit our spending on our Valentine date, they escorted us to view the menu, which they told us was special for the weekend. We decided that the set $85 per person menu (without a Groupon) was a bit beyond what we had intended spending that evening, so we left. We called Zebra shortly after to express our displeasure as there were no restrictions listed on the Groupon, and they had made no efforts to let us know this in advance or of the set menu - I had the reservation for a month. We asked for the manager, but were lucky enough to speak to the owner. We explained that perhaps they should put more effort into alerting their patrons in the future (both that they wouldn't accept promotional discounts and that they had a set menu), as we had been anticipating this dinner for some time, and were now rather disappointed. We were quite surprised to hear indifference from the owner. She didn't even apologize. I have nothing to say about their food, or their decor, or anything beyond the coat check, but I think the owner's lack of interest in customer service speaks volumes for the quality of the establishment. There are plenty of other very nice, non-pretentious restaurants in the area, so spend your money elsewhere. I personally will never go back to Zebra, and I'll speak poorly of it every opportunity I get. Perhaps the owner should have given that more thought when she picked up the phone that night."}
{"text":"First, the food was excellent.  However, the experience overall has been negative.  Bought a restaurant.com gift certificate for Zebra.  Gave it to the waiter when we first arrived.  He knew we intended to use it.  Both my date and I ordered the full meal deal that included the salad, meal, and dessert.  Well when it came time to order dessert, we were informed that the meal deal wasn't included in the gift cert. because it \"cannot be combined with any other offers.\"  He waited until after we had ordered the most expensive parts of our meals to tell us.  So we had to pay regular price for everything and cancel the dessert.  Never offered to speak to a manager and never mentioned anything about the meal not being included until after we ordered and ate 2/3 of it.    Instead of making a scene at the restaurant, I elected to email them at a later time. That was 6 months ago.  Still no response.  I have, however, been added to their mailing list.  Nice business you got there."}
{"text":"I had been to Zebra several times on busy dinners and it was great. So I planned a birthday dinner yesterday for my girlfriend. This time, the service and attention to details were terrible.   When we arrived, there was no one up front greeting guests, even though the restaurant was almost empty. It took a while for the host to show up and seat us.   Our waitress was nice but totally inexperienced for this type of restaurant. She was more en par with a typical chain restaurant at best. She kept  apologizing and saying she was new.   Butter was on the table, yet, no bread was offered throughout the meal.   I ordered the lamb tenderloin medium, and it came out rare. The meat had no flavor or creativity.   A guest at another table received a call and proceeded to put it on speaker for 10 minutes. The host or waitress never asked her to take the call out of the dining area.   I will not come back to Zebra."}
{"text":"IMG_2444.JPG Great lunch. Even though it was almost 3:00 they opened the kitchen for us. Seared scallops w brussel sprouts, bacon and mushrooms in a brown butter sauce. HS really good. Across the street from South Park Mall. Go there."}
{"text":"Zebra is a decent place if your up for the spend. 2 - people will set you back around $120 if you have wine.  The food: I had the Lamb and it was great... My wife had a risotto dish which she said was equally delicious. Desert was pretty amazing (chocolate covered chocolate).  The Service: Our waiter was fantastic. Seriously.  The reason I didn't give this place a 5 star rating is because our treatment by the Hostess. I guess we didn't look wealthy enough for her to consider being nice to that night because she was being very condescending with us.   Zebra, if you are reading... Fire that woman and get someone who makes guests feel welcome.  Fortunately though once seated we were treated like royalty and the food was excellent so it was easy enough to forget. Just be prepared to be judged before being seated."}
{"text":"We went to Zebra tonight for dinner; had the lobster bisque, raspberry salad, lobster, angel hair basket, and chocolate souffle. We also had wine. Overall, we were very impressed with the food quality, portion size and service. This restaurant is pricey, our total with tax and tip was near 200.  But the food was delicious; I would definitely return for a special occasion meal."}
{"text":"Attention to detail marks this restaurant. Reservations easily made and we were seated right away. The menu's faire is exactly what you'd expect with a place of this caliber and it has something for everyone. The service staff could not be more attentive and each person was well trained & professional.  I had the exquisite rack of lamb and my wife had the delicate tournados of beef - both perfectly prepared and delicious. The carrot soup \"pallet cleanser\" was to die for. Every bite of our meal was a delight. For desert the expertly made chocolate mousse was the best we'd ever had. The only disappointment was the missing roasted pine nuts in our simple house salad (as listed in the menu). We look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"The wife and I love Zebra -- sure, it isn't the sort of place you'd go every month given the cost, but we've been very pleased with the experience the three times we've gone.   Part of it is that we have an emotional connection -- when we returned from the vacation where we got engaged, Zebra was where we chose to go to celebrate.   I've only had one dish there - the Lamb Diablo - a dish so good I find myself awaking in the night, licking my lips thinking about it.   Zebra will continue to be a favorite -- a once-in-a-while restaurant for when we're feeling in the mood for a special night out."}
{"text":"The service here was just impeccable, and the food absolutely delicious. The atmosphere however was very stuffy and not very comfortable - and overpriced. I understand fine dining, but if I want to pay $44 for a small plate of food, I want the food to completely blow me away. This did not happen. Don't get me wrong, it was very fresh and tasty, it simply was not anything to write home about. The main thing that I loved about the dinner experience here was when my boyfriend chose to order a soup while I did not, and when they brought out his soup they also brought out a very small tomato soup for myself so that I was not sitting there watching him eat. What other restaurant would do that!? Overall it was a nice experience, just not worth the money."}
{"text":"I recently had a special night out with my husband and we decided to have dinner at Zebra.  I have always heard wonderful things about this establishment and was very excited to go.  My expectations were not only met but exceeded.   The servers went above and beyond, and the food was AMAZING!!!!  Every member of the staff knew this night out was a special occasion, and they all wished us a \"Happy Anniversary.\"  Every member of the staff was extremely knowledgeable about the food and wine.  We each had the four course option on the menu and each course was better than the next.  From the scallops of the evening to the sweet breads then the surf and turf basket and the lamb, they have everything, and everything was great.(FYI-When you dine here mke sure to order the \"Truffle Mushroom soup\")  We were also provided assistance with our wine selection, we needed it.  Zebra's wine list is extensive.  My husband could not believe the wine that is available here. Some of the bottles are unavailble anywhere else in Charlotte. The wine list has everything from \"table wine\", $30, to $1500 bottles.   Overall I have never had a more enjoyable evening in Charlotte than at any other restaurant.  This not an Applebees, Be prepared to dine at Zebra.  This type of dining is very rare in Charlotte. As I mentioned before every single server made a point to help us with anything w  e coud have need.  I cannot wait to have another evening out like this.  The best restaurant in South Park."}
{"text":"I went to this place for my friend's birthday. Our waiter, I think his name was Sean, was amazing. He made my friend , the birthday girl, feel like a princess. His service was exquisite.  I had steak, egg and fries. That's not what it's called on the menu (brunch). But essentially, that's what it was and it was amazing. The steak, medium, was like butter.   The place is very pretty with white linen and fine china. I hope to go back sometime."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the best restaurants we have been to in a very long time in the Charlotte area.  We have passed Zebra many times, a friend encouraged us to try it.  So glad we did!!!!!! The staff was excellent, the food \"amazing\" and anyone who knows me, knows I'm a food \"snob\".  After visiting San Fransisco and having the most amazing food everyday ( even from a food truck) I don't want to pay high prices for mediocre food in the Charlotte area anymore!!!!!! The Zebra was worth every penny... Pasta basket-Every piece of sea food in it cooked perfect, the filet, like butter!!! Tips and Risotto - perfect And the soufflé, absolutely perfect!!!!!!!! Can't wait to go back and I definitely will...."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant, but it feels a little dated. You know it's upscale when you walk in because it's a tad gaudy in decor. The food is good. The potion sizes are fitting and the dishes were well presented. It was a little pricey, but eh, upscale. There is a very nice patio that I think would perfect for conversation and cocktails with friends on a warm summer night."}
{"text":"Had a great experience for my moms birthday. There were three of us and one is lactose intolerant. They made sure everything brought out for him (including a free smoked salmon with creme fraiche) was sans the creme fraiche for him not for me and my mom. We each did the table d'hote and were all very impressed with the food and presentation. Some highlights were the foie gras appetizer (wish there was more though) the angel hair basket and the chocolate soufflé. Everything jus went together. The foie gras app was this play on pb&j which sounds crazy but was amazing! The angel hair basket had tarragon mashed potatoes that went so wel with the tenderloin and seafood in the dish. They also put a candle and a happy birthday on the dessert plate for my mom which was a nice thought by them considering we didn't ask for anything birthday, just mentioned it at the beginning of the meal. If you're looking for a great restaurant with some interesting well thought out dishes, this is definitely the place. I will be going back to try more, there was a great selection and we wanted to try more."}
{"text":"Dark, intimate, and classy. It's a great place for date night, to impress a client, or have an upscale business lunch.   The food is very good and well presented. I had trout most recently and it was made flavorfully and I wanted to keep eating for the taste, not because I was still hungry.   The servers and staff are very friendly and professional. It reminded me of what you see in movies in fancy restaurants and I felt special. While I wouldn't categorize this as a trendy place, it definitely is high end and a place that ideally seems to cater to the \"old money\" crowd, yet allures new professionals.  I recommend getting a reservation and treating yourself to a classy night out."}
{"text":"Do not expect any hospitality from Jim Alexander if you are booking a private party here.  I booked the Serengeti room a little over a month in advance and was told by Jim himself that I would have great service and the best food.  It is important to me when I am booking a private party that I have a completely enclosed space so people can hear the speaker and see the presentation.  I paid my $150 deposit, worked out the menu and was ready for my evening.  The day of the event I stopped by the restaurant early to set up the projector and was told I had been moved into a different room that was not enclosed.  I wanted to know why I hadn't been contacted in advance and what had happened since that was not what I agreed to.  The manager, Michael Stauss wasn't sure what happened and went to get the owner, Jim.  Jim finally came out and said I was now in this room and that they would do what they could to make it right for me.  When I told him I still wanted the room I had booked, he stated with anger that I was NOT getting that room.  No explanation.  I told him I was confused on why nobody had contacted and wanted to know what the reason was for getting moved.   He then threw up his hands, said he couldn't deal with me and stormed from the room.  Since my guests were due to arrive in just a few hours, I had no choice but to deal with the current situation although he had completely rattled my nerves and upset me.  I was not pleased by the room situation during the event, it was still loud from the people singing happy birthday in the other room and although I was told people would be routed through the kitchen to get to the the main dining hall, they came through our room instead.  One man walked all the way through the room confused on where to go.  Other than the room situation, Michael did everything he could to make the situation better including sending me home with a bottle of wine and taking some of the extra fees off of my bill.  The staff was nice and professional and the food was very good.  One of my guests said it was the best salmon he ever had.  Still, after the event, I was emotionally drained that I had been treated so rudely by Jim.  Although the food was great, because of my experience with Jim, I would never have another event here.  At the very least, it is the responsibility of the restaurant to uphold their agreement with you."}
{"text":"Not impressed - for the price the food is average.  The ambiance is okay, not exceptional either.  They need to work with the spacing as well - each room feels cramped, like you're sitting on each other.   For the atmosphere I thought we were going to get great food.  If it's expensive I expect excellence.  Instead it was average, nothing I couldn't find in a midlevel restaurant.  They were out of the desert we wanted to order, out of the wine we wanted to order as well. Overall - meh."}
{"text":"Second time here and STILL SOLID FIVE STARS! I promise I won't be as long as my first review here. I'll summarize it all in one word: AMAZING!  My best friends from Knoxville, TN were in town for my 50th birthday (yeah I can't believe it either), and we decided to go to Zebra based upon my recommendation. And yet again, Zebra delivered!  3 of 4 of us got the 4 course tasting menu which really is a great deal given the quality of the restaurant. I brought a very special 2009 Grand Cru Burgundy (hey you only live once) and my buddy Dean wound up buying a 2011 Ridge Lytton Zin blend. We shared some wine with Michael, Zebra's Sommelier, and even played the \"brown bag\" game with him, which we very much enjoyed. And yes, he has a good palate (FYI)!  I'll post some pics of the food we ate. The Lobster Bisque and their signature Foie Gras Mushroom soups are incredible! Also had a few more appetizers as part of the 4 course deal, such as Scallops and an AWESOME Fois Gras Torchon. THAT was one of the best Foie Gras dishes I've ever had! SPECTACULAR! Then for the mains, we ordered their special Zebra \"Basket\" filled with Lobster, Scallops and Filet in a specially made pasta. I had this before and it's most unique. They of course loved it. I opted for the double Tournados of beef, and they were very flavorful and cooked perfectly (medium rare). My buddy Dean had the duck which was outstanding.   Their desserts were works of art, in addition to being delicious. Their pecan chocolate torte was delectable and not too sweet. Almost had a savory component to it. His wife had a chocolate cake with a homemade ice cream with a brittle compote. Also delicious.  The wait staff here is uber professional, friendly, and accomodating. Michael the Sommelier really helped make our evening by taking a few moments of his busy night to engage with us and enjoy our wine game (we brown bag them to keep our palates sharp). He then shared a \"blind glass\" with us, which was fantastic!  Again, I HIGHLY recommend Zebra! It's just as good as Barringtons, just a little different. But you can't go wrong at either place. I still say BOTH are the BEST restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Old world French (in a good way) - sole amandine, swordfish w/ Mornay sauce, tournedos rossini, impeccable service, dressy-a man without a jacket will appear conspicuous. We were at one of the summer Friday afternoon happy hours and thoroughly enjoyed selections from the bar/appetizer menu. But a recent dinner was disappointing - OK, but not great. Appetizers: the fois gras was unacceptable - two thin slivers cooked all the way through; the scallops were tasty, but the accompaniments were tasteless and we couldn't discern what they were (one was a cooked grain of some kind). Entrees: Dover sole and lamb tenderloins OK, but we couldn't get excited about either of them. There may be other entrees that were better choices, as other parties around us seemed to be enjoying their food. Desserts: Excellent."}
{"text":"I travel extensively and globally, entertaining customers and enjoy the opportunity to try some of the best ,and unfortunately some of the most overrated, places in major cities.  Unfortunately, Zebra falls into the category of \"I'm not going there again.\"   The waiter starts off with the special entrees and give us the pitch on the oysters and the scallop appetizers. We socialize a bit and he comes back and four of us place our orders. After a bit, the waiter comes back to inform us our appetizer (oysters) are actually sold out and he's very sorry. We order an Oregon Pinot, Penner Ash, a solid good Shea Vineyard selection which we've tried before.  The menu is a bit over the top. Every dish seems to have something in it to kill the patron. For example the \"Simple Fish\" is a flounder in and wine and butter sauce with some tapenade....blah, blah, blah...the covered with a lobster tail with some cream sauce. I'm like \"what?, that's simple?\" Finally, I asked what's the lightest thing on the menu and was directed to chicken in a hollandaise sauce.   Get REAL folks!. You can't eat this ostentatious crap and 1) expect it to be \"French food\", and 2) expect to continue live to the next day. I was in France less than 6 months ago. The French do not eat this crap. OK, I'll get off my soapbox....the menu was extreme, but there were some salad options as starters.  Personally, I had the Zebra salad which was good and had organic greens, raspberry and citrus fruits. I ended up ordering the simple fish w/o the lobster and w/o the sauce. If the flounder is good, why ruin it? It was ok.   We shared a dessert and coffee afterwards.  Then, we got the check which totaled about $400 for 4 people with 1 bottle of wine. We couldn't figure out how this happened until we realized we either misread, (or our menu was incorrect), the price of the Penner Ash....it was $155 and we thought it was $70.   We called the waiter back and he said he's see what he could do. I googled the wine and the full retail price on the web ranges from 38.99 to 52.99. 400% markup on wine is unheard of! Even if we made a mistake, we were appalled and disappointed at Zebra's pricing and subsequent treatment. Needless to say, we paid and left. (Zebra did offer us 10% off the wine after the waiter phoned the owner.)  The ambiance is good, service is raw for a \"fine french restaurant\" and food average or sub-optimal. Combine this with ridiculous mark-up and my suggestion is find another place to dine. The place won a lot of awards and realizing I'm going against the grain, however, this isn't 21st century good food, good service or even a good menu.    I'm very disappointed with this selection.  (Definitely falls into Yelp's \"splurge\" category without the complete \"experience\")"}
{"text":"Waiter was really goofy.  My wife saw him in an argument with the GM.  Food was equal to the meals we have had at Cheesecake Factory across the street at half the price.  Meal for two was $78 with no wine or drinks.  There are better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"For spending $215 - even with a $40 coupon - I had hoped this review would be better.   The fella and I went for dinner on a Saturday night, and everything started out great. The tables are a little close together, which makes it a smidgen uncomfortable if you're right next to another couple, but we went with it, and it seemed a little more lively than the one other time we went many years ago.  Our service started out awesome, and we got wine, appetizer (scallops, which were great), and the chicken entree (me) and trout special (fella). The trout came with a crab cake, which the fella said was absolutely disgusting... the trout was phenomenal, and he said he wished they'd had a bigger trout and no scallops. My chicken was pretty delicious though.  We ordered the dessert sampler, and when our waiter brought it out, he asked if we could just eat off that plate or if we wanted separate plates. I asked for separate plates, and we waited... and waited... and waited. Finally we just ate off the dessert plate. I don't mind that, but how do you offer plates and then never bring them?  It took another good 20 minutes for our original waiter to finally come by and bring the bill, which surprisingly had an automatic 18% gratuity added. I don't know if that's because we had a coupon or because they do it to everyone, but it left a bad taste in my mouth.  For the money we spent, I'd have much rather spent my night at Lumiere, Del Frisco's, Fig Tree, etc."}
{"text":"Some friends treated us to An Evening in Tuscany 5-course meal for my husband's birthday, and I do mean Treat.  It was our first time even in the restaurant and needless to say it made quite an impression when upon our arrival we were greeted by President/Head Chef Jim Alexander, and a glass of sparkling bubbly.  From then on it was one delight after another, as we experienced our first wine and food pairing event.  From the foie gras soup (heavenly!) paired perfectly with a 2008 Tuscan Merlot, to the fresh pasta, griddled squab and prime sirloin, each with its own wine accompaniment, not to mention the endless warm rolls, we discovered many new wines and many new foods.  Lucky for us we were seated with some very seasoned food & wine experts who do this sort of thing sometimes more than once or twice a week, so they clued us in on how it all works.  I love roasted Sage now, too.  Who knew?!  We had a great new culinary experience, and surely wouldn't mind if anyone wanted to treat us again!"}
{"text":"We went with another couple to Zebra for dinner. We enjoyed our meals (2 catch of the day; 1 trout; 1 Asiago risotto) & the ambiance was nice. We ordered a bottle of wine to have with our meal & it took a while to arrive. We had to check on it twice & it arrived after our entrees. At the end of the night, we received the check & paid via credit card. After we had signed the check & we about the leave, the waiter came back & said he had made a mistake & needed to run the cards again. He brought back a new check & said \"you're good to go\" & walked away from the table, but we weren't sure what that meant. The new bill was $50 more than the one we signed for originally. After calling him back to the table & asking more questions, we learned he had given us the signature receipts for another table to sign. Obviously we wanted to pay for what we ordered, but we just felt the need for a greater explanation than \"you're good to go\" when the new check was $50 more than the one we originally signed."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Zebra a few months ago. I agree with another yelper post that the location could be better, but they've done a great job making the space feel intimate and elegant. And the food is - is - well, it's just delicious! - and beautiful to look at as well. We don't do a lot of fine-dining in town, so I guess I can't compare it to loads of places in Charlotte. But it was one of the best dining experiences we've had anywhere, so kudos Zebra! this will be our go-to place for special occasions, methinks..."}
{"text":"Went for valentine's dinner and as mentioned in other reviews, the tables are very close to one another making it not romantic at all. The waiter was the most rude person I have ever met, he has no business being in the service industry.   First offense: The salads that came out were not the salads we ordered. I didn't want to complain because the salad I had in front of me looked good but my husband's did not so he decided to tell the waiter. The waiter promptly took our plates and gave them to another table across the room. Unfortunately this happened after I had taken a bite of my salad. Thankfully I noticed what had happened and warned the recipient of the used salad before they dug in. When the manager came over to ask about the situation he made no apology and somehow found nothing wrong with giving someone a salad touched by someone else. Then this same situation happened to the table sitting next to us.   Second offense: Upon receiving our main course my husband asked if the waiter could describe the dish (partly because he was worried he would have the same switch-up happen) and the waiter just replied with \"food.\" Looking back on it, this would have been a funny response had I been in a fast food chain and not pay $270 for a below par meal. The food was average and nothing special. I would never ever go back and feel that I was robbed."}
{"text":"The hubby bought an Amazon Local deal for Zebra some time ago and we finally were able to have lunch there yesterday. I was thoroughly impressed!   We started with the Black Truffle-Reggiano Pommes Frites and they were soooo good. We ate every single one of them. The \"mustard dill\" sauce served on the side was awesome and very unique. I ordered the Lobster Roll which was perfection. Nice chunks of meat, light sauce and a warm buttery roll. I've only had lobster rolls served cold, so it was a welcome surprise that it was served warm. The chips served with the sandwich were meh. The hubby ordered the Beef tips with risotto and asparagus. I had a bite and it was pretty good. As we were waiting on our waitress to bring back our check, the chef/owner and a Summer Intern brought out a complimentary Chocolate Souffle' with Vanilla Creme Anglaise hot out of the oven. My day was made!   The service and food were excellent, I cannot wait to return. Perhaps for our anniversary in a few months. :)"}
{"text":"The food I had tasted like old washcloth, but then again, I don't think I've ever enjoyed French restaurants. I had Rainbow Trout Franchaise With Pommery Mash, Haricots Verts And Sauce Vin Blanc, because it was one of the entrees that the server recommended when I asked what was good there. The service was good. Maybe it'd be a better place to visit for dinner."}
{"text":"Wow this is my new go-to place for impressing people with my choice of restaurants.  Yes - it is pricey.  We will get that out of the way up front.  Located near South Park mall, there is plenty of parking in the back of the restaurant.  It has a patio (when I was there it was too cold to partake but it looked nice.)    I took the boyfriend there to thank him in advance for tolerating a Czech Xmas menu prepared by moi.  Our waiter was absolutely the most professional and knowledgeable waiter I have ever had (outside Pink House in Savannah).  Each course from soup to nuts was outstanding.  I thought since it was so fancy-pants that the courses would be small.  No!  I had to take my leftovers home.  It sounds dumb but i don't think i have ever tasted chicken so chicken-y?  You will understand what I mean when you go.    The decor is uber-romantic and the only thing a little not-great was the fact that the acoustics were a little off.  It was VERY loud in there - a couple of obnoxious diners sat two tables away and we could hear every darn word.  But you could probably ask for a more private table.....Sigh this place is worth every penny and I am so in love!  Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"I can't speak enough about how unbelievable our meal was. This is one of Charlotte's ONLY non-chain fine dining options and it did not disappoint.  We did not hold back ordering from this incredible menu. Lobster bisque, muscles with pork belly, foie gras with an apple sauce, baby Maine lobster and muscles in a butter sauce, duck two ways (best duck I've ever had), chocolate lava cake with salted caramel ice cream (best ice cream I've ever had), and the most incredible and decadent vanilla bean souffle there ever was. It was worth every penny. The waiter recommended an excellent Chardonnay to compliment my preference. The butter that accompanied the bread was even amazing.   Perfect for a romantic date night or hosting out of town company. I'm dying to go back!  Edit: I almost forgot! There was a grapefruit juice shot that was given before our meal, again, so gourmet and exquisite. We felt like royalty!"}
{"text":"Heck ya amazing!!!! really really good food and wait staff ubber nice.... great find passing though.... Had a 4 course fix prix, which was literally 4 full course for a small price...."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner last night. There as a guest with my wife, her work holiday dinner. We both had the Truffle Mushroom Foie Gras soup (as recommended). Wow! Delicious, wonderful flavor, perfect temperature. Next I had the Zebra Angel Hair Beef Tenderloin, again as recommended. This dish has the beef, lobster, shrimp, and scallops and each item was super flavorful and cooked perfectly. I highly recommend it. She had the  smoked salmon and was elated with the dish. Awesome meal, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful with all the wood and all the little details. I was shocked that there were only 4 couples in the restaurant though. There was one waiter/sommelier that night and I thought his service was spotty. I could hear him carry on with one table and then be kind of cold with the other. Was he threatened by two women? He was kind of cold to our table and actually forgot to mention that the soufflé took 20 minutes and we should order it before even though he told the other two tables about the soufflé when he took their order. Anyway, the food was excellent and the presentation was also. I felt bad that there was almost no one here and I hope they are full at other times..  There were excellent specials and their deal of 3 courses for $60 was definitely worthwhile. I would go back and perhaps ask for another server(even though this evening he was the only one)."}
{"text":"Gotta say, probably the most creative dishes that you will find in Charlotte and a presentation to match.  I was a bit hesitant at first to even try this place as I just imagined in my head nothing but ultra small gourmet plates.  I was way off base, I ordered a lamb tenderloin dish and was very pleased with portion size and the taste was phenomenal.  I was here with my love and it was indeed a romantic setting.  Service is top notch too and they will do whatever to make sure you are taken care of from the moment you walk in till you are ready to leave.  The only drawback I have was the decor.  Low ceilings, cheap tables and chairs and the location of the seating is too close to other diners.  That was a real bummer for me but overall I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"After a good dinner at Zebra a couple months ago, we were excited to try their brunch. Unfortunately, brunch was a HUGE disappointment and I doubt we'll be making any future visits.   First thing first... Service was awful. Granted, there were only 2 servers tending the entire place, but there were also only 8 or so occupied tables. The place was dead. That should have been our first warning sign.   We asked for some explanations of the menu. Simple things like, \"What fruit comes with the French toast?\" and sent our waiter into a complete tailspin. Once we managed to get our order placed, we waited almost an hour for the food to arrive. While we waited, our water and coffee glasses sat empty. When we finally begged refills from the host as he passed our table after seating someone else, the coffee refill was room temperature.   When the food came, it all got worse. My dish was missing the bacon promised in the description and the potatoes were so undercooked and under seasoned they were inedible. My dad asked for the egg on his burger to be cooked all the way through and stressed NO runny yolk. The minute he cut into it, yolk ran everywhere. He sent it back to the kitchen where someone obviously wiped off the yolk from the bun and burger and slapped on a new, over hard egg. My boyfriend's $19 truffle burger was a disgrace. Flavorless and over cooked. The fries were the only tasty thing on the table.   They get 2-stars instead of just one because my mom enjoyed her French toast.   Seriously, Zebra. If you can't do brunch well, just stay closed. (And, judging from other reviewers, you REALLY cannot do brunch well.) It's a shame you ruined our decent dinner experience. You're loosing customers with this shoddy Sunday service!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Staff has always been friendly and accommodating. I love their salads over lunch time. We had valentines day dinner here and made reservations months in advance, was the best valentines day meal we've ever had! Often super crowded which can make it feel like you're eating family style."}
{"text":"I went to Zebra years ago and was not impressed because of service. My boyfriend surprised me about a month ago with a dinner here for our 3rd anniversary and I was so pleasantly surprised! Zebra changed management about two years ago and I think it was a wonderful decision for them. Zebra is a mix of traditional and modern French cuisine. Service was wonderful - they kept filling our plates with warm bread and butter and it was so hard not to fill up on that! We ordered the green curry mussels (not my favorite - couldn't tell if it was the curry that made it taste funny or if it wasn't fresh), amazing seared scallops, a duck breast that came with wisps of cotton candy , and a \"surf and turf\" special - a 10 oz. filet mignon with a lobster/crab/scallop salad on top. It was one of the best meals I've had in years. Looking forward to the next meal here!"}
{"text":"An exceptional dining experience. Very friendly and well trained staff compliments the exceptional kitchen. Enjoyed the perfectly prepared trout. Excellent wine list. Very cozy interior. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best, most creative menu in Charlotte. Atmosphere is nice, service is excellent. Order the zebra basket or scallops and you won't regret it.   Best overall restaurant in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Zebra as we've been talking about going for awhile.  I would like to give it 3 stars, but I just can't right now.  Maybe after another visit.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and I love white tablecloths.  It's just so nice.  A very nice patio outside which I look forward to going and relaxing on one nice evening.  They had a nice guitar player strumming on the patio.  This is a pricey restaurant and unfortunately we were disappointed in the menu.  My companion noted that this was a very \"country-club\" menu and very limited.  He didn't see anything he really wanted from the dinner menu.  I ordered the trout, but that evening it was unavailable.  So we ended up getting a couple of appetizers which were ok, but nothing special and not as good as some similar items we've had elsewhere.  We basically left after spending $100 on apps and drinks still wanting dinner.  The service was spotty.  We sat ourselves at the bar but even there we were a bit...ignored.  It seems there were some issues with what server was handling what area and were a bit unprepared for people on the patio wanting to eat out there, though why I don't know.  Also, for a beautiful Friday evening at 7-ish they were very empty.  I think this place has a lot of potential, but I think even they know they could use an infusion of a young sophisticates.  I think if they do some intro events (Yelp?! :) and change and or expand their menu, they might do even better."}
{"text":"Do not expect any hospitality from Jim Alexander if you are booking a private party here.  I booked the Serengeti room a little over a month in advance and was told by Jim himself that I would have great service and the best food.  It is important to me when I am booking a private party that I have a completely enclosed space so people can hear the speaker and see the presentation.  I paid my $150 deposit, worked out the menu and was ready for my evening.  The day of the event I stopped by the restaurant early to set up the projector and was told I had been moved into a different room that was not enclosed.  I wanted to know why I hadn't been contacted in advance and what had happened since that was not what I agreed to.  The manager, Michael Stauss wasn't sure what happened and went to get the owner, Jim.  Jim finally came out and said I was now in this room and that they would do what they could to make it right for me.  When I told him I still wanted the room I had booked, he stated with anger that I was NOT getting that room.  No explanation.  I told him I was confused on why nobody had contacted and wanted to know what the reason was for getting moved.   He then threw up his hands, said he couldn't deal with me and stormed from the room.  Since my guests were due to arrive in just a few hours, I had no choice but to deal with the current situation although he had completely rattled my nerves and upset me.  I was not pleased by the room situation during the event, it was still loud from the people singing happy birthday in the other room and although I was told people would be routed through the kitchen to get to the the main dining hall, they came through our room instead.  One man walked all the way through the room confused on where to go.  Other than the room situation, Michael did everything he could to make the situation better including sending me home with a bottle of wine and taking some of the extra fees off of my bill.  The staff was nice and professional and the food was very good.  One of my guests said it was the best salmon he ever had.  Still, after the event, I was emotionally drained that I had been treated so rudely by Jim.  Although the food was great, because of my experience with Jim, I would never have another event here.  At the very least, it is the responsibility of the restaurant to uphold their agreement with you."}
{"text":"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Zebra Restaurant in South Park. I was very pleased with everything that was placed at my table. With a French American contemporary menu I felt that all of the dishes would be approachable to those who don't necessarily enjoy traditional french cuisine. Inventive menu. The chef who is young isn't without experience. I enjoyed hearing about all the different places he has worked and has traveled to. One of my favorite dishes, hands down, from the new seasonal menu would be the Crispy, Slow Cooked Pork Belly with Apricots and Lemon and Thyme Corn Bread and Chestnuts and Pepper Jelly! Whether you'd like to sit inside or out you have two different dining options at Zebra. inside, Inside: I would consider more fine dining. dim lighting and white tablecloths set it off. You also have the option of a more relaxed atmosphere and that is on their newly renovated patio. More relaxed and approachable and sometimes they have live music which I haven't experienced yet, but I believe would make for a beautiful and enjoyable night of dining. ."}
{"text":"Excellent upscale inventive menu!!!   The scallops were great and their fish is just mouthwatering.  Definitely expensive but when your craving really flavorful refined, well made food in a formal atmosphere this will make your happy.  THe service is impeccable but very stiff- not exactly friendly but technically excellent.  I brought my kids at an early seating - it was ok but I did feel a little uncomfortable having kids at such a formal restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while now, and a Living Social coupon finally gave me the excuse to visit.   We walked up to Zebra through a beautiful outdoor area. We debated sitting out there but it felt a little causal for fancy dining. I didn't change out of my work clothes when I got home so I wanted to sit in the classy dining area. If I am going to wear a dress and heels after hours it needs to mean something! We do hope to return to the patio for drinks before the weather gets cold.  We were promptly greeted at the front by the man behind the bar who also happened to be our waiter. He sat us at a small (but spaced well away from the nearby tables) table. I was sorely disappointed when I opened the menu and didn't see the angel hair basket that I have had my eye on since scoping this place out online. The dish was still listed on their online menu.   We started with a complimentary amuse bouche of bell pepper soup. It was creamy and delicious and the smell was phenomenal. Great start to the meal.   After much consideration I decided to order the 14 oz sirloin that was on special. It came topped with a kebab of shrimp and red pepper and served over a bed of fingerling potatoes. The sauce on the steak was spot on and it was more food than I could eat. Unfortunately this was also the major failing point of the night. I ordered my steak medium and it come out rare. I suppose I should have sent it back but I had a little incident where my steak knife made a bid for freedom and I had to wait to get a replacement. By the time I was able to cut into more than the outer edges of the steak my companion had finished his meal and I felt like it was too late to send back. The companion had the duck two ways and both preparations were delicious as were the accompanying brussels sprouts and carrots.   The waiter we had spent the night making jokes and brought us a small dessert after we declined ordering any more food. He wrapped up my leftover steak (which made delicious steak and eggs the next morning) and applied the discount without a problem.   I loved the mix of flavors we sampled during the night and the whole experience was lovely but I have to deduct a star for the cook on the steak. For fine dining in Charlotte Zebra elevated many simple ingredients and had an attention to detail in the service that was impressive. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Not sure what people see is great in this restaurant.  Below average food, difficult to categorize as french, wait staff was undeservedly arrogant ( maybe this contributes to some people thinking its better than it really is), service was painfully slow, steak special was way overdone, but took so long that we didn't want to send back.  Ambiance is stuffy, distractingly quiet, and definitely not french.  Very boring, Nothing interesting.  I cant find anything that stands out from a positive aspect.  5 of us had dinner, only one entrée was good, the rest; very disappointing.  Unfortunately a waste of time for all of us, couldn't wait to leave."}
{"text":"We went to Zebra on Saturday to celebrate my Birthday. Overall the experience was disappointing:  When we arrived the table they reserved for us had been sat in already so we did a little backtracking to the main lobby. The manager (?)  asked if we wanted to be seated right away or sit at the bar and wait for a \"really good seat.\" We decided to wait. At the bar they were out of the Chardonnay I ordered but the wine the manager recommended was good so I didn't have any problems with that.   After 15-20 minutes our seat became available and it was nice so we felt it was worth waiting for. The bread they served was warm and fresh,  and the herbed butter was excellent.  I ordered  the \"Zebra Signature Angel Hair Basket with Beef Tenderloin, Lobster, Shrimp, Scallops, Haricots Verts and Baby Carrots, Veal Glace and Tarragon Beurre Butter.\"  I guess I expected the pasta to be edible, but it really was not. The noodles were hard and they kept breaking all over the plate so I couldn't really get a bite without hard noodle in it. I am sure they were cooked in some fashion to form the basket, but they did not taste good. I am all for presentation unless it detracts from the taste of the meal, which in this case it did. I asked the server if you were suppose to eat the noodles and he said some people do and sort of nervously laughed and walked away.   For a  $44 entree I was also really surprised at the lack of seafood (2  fairly small scallops, 2 small shrimp, and one piece of lobster about the size of half-dollar). If this dish were $25-30 I would have felt it was worth it. My tenderloin had a TON of black pepper on it, so much that I coughed after my first bite and would have sent it back if I were not able to scrape it off.  My steak was cooked perfectly and with less pepper it was good.   Finally, we decided on the soufflé of the day ( keep in mind it takes about 20 min to prepare). Our server told us it was vanilla bean but it tasted a lot like creamsicle, it was ok.    Service: The manager was very friendly and did a great job, but our server wasn't very good. He left drinks unfilled for most of the dinner, and just wasn't very present throughout the meal.   What saved Zebra a bit was the fact that we had a Google deal so it was not quite as expensive as it would have been otherwise, that being said I am not sure I would visit again. I've had much better high-end dining experiences in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Can I have all my meals here? I used to say restaurants could never impress me. This one definitely hit the mark and proved me wrong!  We went here for a friend's birthday on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant wasn't busy when we sat down around 6:30, but it started to pick up after 7:00. Our waitress was very nice and Michael, the \"wine guy,\" is a necessity to this restaurant. They have over 2,000 different kinds of wine!  We chose the Table d'Hote three course option, and no one was disappointed. Note that their appetizers are portioned for one person and aren't meant to be shared.  We were first given a small cucumber dish that is meant to \"awaken your tastebuds,\" and this changes every night. My appetizer was a salad that had pieces of citrus fruit, a raspberry dressing, and an almond confection that reminded me of a brittle. It was VERY good and appropriate for the warm weather outside. We were told that their menu actually changes seasonally.  I stuck with the beef tenderloin as my main dish, and it was perfectly cooked. The potatoes and prosciutto asparagus were very tasty as well. The entree was the perfect size portion as well. For dessert I had the souffle of the day--a chocolate Godiva souffle served with a chocolate sauce. All I can say is oh my gosh! It was so good and not too chocolatey--that's what the sauce was for!  Overall it was a very fantastic experience. The ambiance is perfectly on point, the staff is knowledgeable, and their service is impeccable. If you're like me and you insist a restaurant can never impress you, be prepared for Zebra to blow you away. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It would not be possible for me to be more impressed with a restaurant unless Thomas Keller himself had come out and pronounced he was their secret chef for the day.  Not kidding!    In Charlotte visiting a friend and didn't have great expectations regarding food, but this was beyond anything I could have imagined.  We asked to be seated outside in this cozy courtyard area with every assumption that the service might be slightly slower since nobody else was seated outside.  Wow were we wrong. Our server Eric was absolutely fantastic!  I have to say one of the best servers in my restaurant eating history!!!!  The tourchon of fois is fabulous.  Tomorrow we may go back and just order a few of these and call it a day.  We will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars solely based on the hospitality that we received here.  GNO was such a great time because the staff totally went out of their way for us.  We did the restaurant week stuff.  The food was pretty good.  I tried a bit of everything.  Mushroom soup was delish...it was truffled up but I LOVE truffle! Scallop app was good Dover sole was the best sole I have had...shocking coming from a \"foodie' from Chicago Lamb was also excellent Tenderloin was a bit too salty Salmon was ok  Desserts were just ok. Souffle was MEH.  It wasnt chocolatey enough and then they poured a fruit sauce over it...I wasnt a fan Salted caramel ice cream...was DELISH, but I am an ice cream whore  Like I said, the staff was truly excellent.  Personable and funny, yet elegant.  The bar area was just meh.  I wished they had a larger bar.  They can only fit like 4 people seated at the bar."}
{"text":"So I'm actually like a 3.7 but Yelp is forcing me to round up.  The thing is, when I know I'm walking into a 3-$ sign restaurant, I'm kinda hoping...and, expecting...to be blown away by every aspect of the night. It makes me feel better about dropping serious cheddar.    The decor is a little dated and random. It's my expectation of schmanciness that the decor is made to feel that way as well. Our waiter could have been new - he almost seemed nervous, the way he was bumbling through the menu and specials. We also asked him about a few French words on the menu, and what they meant. He didn't know. Umm okay...guess I'll google it!  My 2 friends, husband and I all did the $52 table d'hote. You do actually need to do the math because it's not all a great deal. The scallops as appetizers were superb.  Between the 4 of us, we got the duck, lamb, and trout entrees. PERFECTLY cooked proteins - entrees were absolutely stars of the show. For dessert we got the pistachio dacquoise. It was good, but not great. A tad dry. Husband said vanilla Creme brûlée was good.  One odd snafu- the wrong entrees were put in front of us...and a few minutes later, they took them away and put them in front of other people. Granted, we hadn't yet touched it, and mistakes happen, but not sure how I feel about that.  I guess it's a good thing we weren't sick or sneezy?  All in all, good food, and entrees worth the high dollar...but you can get a more complete fancy restaurant experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"Order the grand tasting menu just for this chef's highly pleasing version of Thomas Keller's salmon cornet with crème fraîche. You can't go wrong with the hearty truffled mushroom foie gras soup. Pick the tournedos of beef tenderloin over the salmon, which normally would be my favorite. The pistachio dacquoise torte is an ideal end."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Had brunch there today and the menu is very upscale..I had the steak and eggs with carmelized onions and roasted tomatoes...Excellent!! The steak was perfectly seasoned and tender enough to cut with your fork. The fritz...or fries were awesome as well. Our waiter Tyrell was exceptionally accommodating!! I highly recommend this place.."}
{"text":"I was disappointed, not in food or service, but because they changed conditions of an offer. I had a Groupon for $30 for $60, & we went the Sat. before Valentines Day. The Groupon excluded Mon (2/14) but not Sat (2/12). We arrived to discover that they would not honor any promotions. Since we knew we couldn't get in anywhere else, we were stuck. The mgr complained that 25 ppl had not shown up. They probably saw the same sign & left. Seeing that we seemed unhappy, he brought over a \"service mgr\" saying he would give us anything we wanted. He offered drinks, which we already had, then we never saw him again. Bizarre. Why not just honor the $60 & not lose business? We spent over $300 due to a fixed price menu & were unhappy. Stupid. I'll go back just to use the Groupon but never again. The food was good overall, but my fish was overcooked and the salad was more bulk than quality. The service was good but due to the unpleasant surprise I'd rather give my business to one of the large number of other restaurants in Charlotte than drive 20 minutes next time."}
{"text":"Very over rated restaurant. The waiter was a heavy smoker and smelt bad. The prices were very steep and the food was so so. My friend, a vegetarian, could not find anything on the menu.   The wine list is impressive, but they did not have 2 of my selections.   Never again. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Not what it use to be......been to zebra many times over the years, had not been there for several months but decided to hit it again for my 8 wedding anniversary, it was sort of our \"Anniv tradition\" over the past 5 yrs. or so.  Made a 7:30 reservation 2 hrs prior, they asked if it was a special occasion, told them Wedding Aniv, we arrived at 710 ready for wine and apps at the bar...they seemed all flustered that we were early, told them we were MORE than happy to hang at the bar and have wine and apps, there were no other patrons at the bar, just the bartender/waiter/manager person, we'll call him waiter 2. Asked for app menu, we quickly had 2 glasses of wine, a cali pinot, not bad and refreshingly LIGHT, no menu. A chef came out or someone in a chef coat, and proceeded to explain to the bartender and us, that they \"only had one fish and 86 on the lobster.\" No worries, we're easy and we're hanging at the bar, waiting on a menu to order apps, I'm hungry btw. Still no menu, bartender gone, Waiter 1 tells us the table is ready, Ok, we're chillin' in the bar, but we'll go the table if we have to, I'm still hungry. We sit, packed in between two other couples,  there are clearly other tables open but whatever, maybe they have big group on the way, I order a bottle of wine, and FINALLY an appetizer, the antipasto, waiter 1 tells us the specials, several that are fish and all that have lobster in them, OK I'm confused and not sure what \"86 lobster\" means now or where they found the other fish. Wine comes, brought by waiter 2 who is also the bartender. He pours, it's good, cheers wife of 8 years, Waiter 2 suddenly wants our order, tell him we have a antipasto on the way, he tells me that's not how they do it, they need me to order the whole meal at one time, because they are on a schedule and everything comes out at a predetermined time dictated by the chef or kitchen. I said \"sorry I was not aware, we just wanted some antipasto with our wine, btw took forever to get some bread, and twice as long for any butter to arrive, I'm hungry and knocking back vinos. He proceeds to tell me that Waiter 1 is new but should have explained that I have to order my whole meal.  OK fine, so we figure out what we want, 2 salads, 2 entrees....angry waiter 2 talks the order and starts to run off when I stop him and say \"what about your souffle, Don't I need to put that in too\", he gives me the yea, yea, need that too. Meal comes it was good, but I've drained my first bottle of wine, we're getting a taxi anyhow, I have a third of my meal left I want more wine, no waiter 1, no waiter 2........Oh that's because Angry Waiter 2 is over at a 4 top of older ladies BERATING one lady because she did not want any dressing on her salad, no EVOO, no lemon juice, No means NO but he would not have it, he went on for 2 minutes trying to convince this poor lady to have something on her salad. Finally, waiter 1 comes by, I tell him it's a wine emergency, we're both dry and still eating, tell him I want 2 glasses of a big red....he places 2 glasses of  SHORT POURS on the table and takes off  again, I take a sip, it's the light Pinot from when we first got there. OK, meal done, I'm ready to go, the couple next to us is pissed too, they  tried to use a coupon and the deal didn't match what they ate or something, Angry Waiter 2 was lecturing them at this point about proper coupon etiquette. I have a taxi on the way, I'm ready to go, and I have a coupon too, $20 off, this should be fun, oh and my perfectly timed souffle is nowhere to be found.  Souffle arrives 30 min after we finish our meal, and 3 minutes after my cab shows up. We wolf down the lava hot souffle. Angry waiter 2 hands me the bill and tells me \"18% gratuity was included but you can add more.\" I pay the tab, $250+ and we go.....walked right past angry waiter 2 and waiter 1, no one said a word to us as we left.  Their web site won't allow text emails only reservations and their stupid coupons have a wrong number on them."}
{"text":"Friendly staff as I walked into the restaurant. Very romantic patio and indoor seating as well. I got Caesar as appetizer. Then lobster and pork belly for entree...both delicious. Desert trio platter was amazing! Great service, tasty food. This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Crap on your Groupon customers.  Tried to redeem before it expired and was turned away because \"we have 100 people coming in and only 4 servers\". Classy.   Mayberry lives!"}
{"text":"Nice place. The only reason why this place has lost two stars is because since I've relocated to Charlotte, I've noticed that managers will come around and greet the customers...ask how the meal is. When my husband and I dined there, we chose to sit outside and there was a gentleman there sitting with his laptop. All the while I thought he was a patron. By the time I finished my desert and was ready to leave, I noticed that he was speaking with a couple that had just walked in and he was making sure they were comfortable. My husband and I thought that was strange since he never came to check on us. So while my husband got the car, I walked inside the restaurant and asked if he was the manager. \"I'm actually the owner\" (even worse in my opinion). \"Did you enjoy everything\"? I told him I did and I walked off. Not sure why there was a difference with how we were treated vs the other couple but I'm willing to say race played a part. There was no need to make sure this customer was pleased. My waiter however, was top notch. My husband usually brings brokers there for lunch. That will stop. Such is life Zebra."}
{"text":"I gave Zebra another chance, and have been let down again.  Maybe Zebra was once a AAA 4 Diamond Restaurant, but not anymore.  The tables are cheap and uneven uneven, and chairs are kep in a bathroom stall. service is sloppy and lacks knowledge, but still pretentious.  The service staff are basically order takers who lack any attention to detail or the impeccable customer service of Zebra's former reputation. The \"manager\" is  unprofessional and rude it's a miracle if he is still an employee.  A grown man,  working in the service industry,  representing a business was picking his nose in and around the kitchen.  What a disappointing time for a once AAA 4 Diamond Restaurant.   I hope they can turn it around."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with solid food.  Went here because I bought a Groupon.  I got the NY Strip and it was fantastic!  I must admit, I probably would not go back due to the pricing unless I had another Groupon."}
{"text":"To call this a French Restaurant is an insult to France and to some of the other delicious French restaurants found in the U.S.  We were 5 for dinner for a yearly affair which we aren't ready to repeat at Zebra.  a. the Lobster Bisque was the best thing of the dinner and it was good - a bit too heavy for a bisque but that's common it seems so I didn't mind too much.  b. the Simple Fish of the Day was: \"A swordfish with Bouillabaisse sauce, fried oyster, scallops and homemade potato dumplings etc\": over peppery, complex, battling tastes and this concoction has never seen the Bouillabaisse making region of anywhere... It resembled more a Viandox/Knorr Beef Bouillon than a Bouillabaise... sadly, my scallop was undercooked and/or probably a bit tad past the point of fresh but I noticed it too late as the sauce was overwhelming. Spent 2 hours at home being sick.  c. the Dessert - Pistachio Dacquoise Torte, Chocolate Ganache, Passion Fruit Coulis -  humm indiscernable taste between the pistachio and chocolate ganache, as for the Coulis, I think the Pastry Chef needs a refresher on what a coulis is supposed to be - this was a sticky, super syrupy and sugary goo, closer to a reduction that has been reduced too long than a coulis.  d. the wine list was actually lacking as seen from a viewpoint of a fancy French Restaurant - mostly California wines and pricey as for the French selection - average picks unless you don't mind spending over $ 150 a bottle.  Of note for a restaurant that wants to be of this level, it was surprising borderline shocking that there was no Sommelier on duty.  e. Service was good in the beginning but then seemed to vanish as we got closer to closing time - we arrived at 7:45pm and left a bit after 10pm. The manager vanished faster than a solar eclipse about 1/3 of the way through the meal...  Overall: the food was way heavier than it needed to be and lacked true refinement.  Recap:  $ 650 for 4... worth generously $ 350.  To think that their website states in big (bold) letters:  Where world class flavor meets local flair... Where every course amazes... Where excellence is tradition..."}
{"text":"Went here during \"restaurant week\" where their normal prix fix menu ($44) was $30.  They don't really seem to advertise this, you have to kind of know that this is what you want.  At first they didn't even give us a fixed price menu, and then when they did, they didn't mention the $30 promotion.  But, we were able to get it.  Overall the food was pretty great.   The service was also excellent.  To start, the fresh bread was basically neverending, although most of us stopped filling up on it.  Good bread though.  Then we were brought some red pepper bisque served in a small cup as a pre app.  From the menu, I ordered the foie gras black truffle soup, the lamb \"diablo\", and the vanilla bean creme brulee.  The soup was pretty outstanding.  I didn't taste the duck liver too much but it was my first time having truffle, but I'm sure it was a very small amount.  The soup was velvety and very tasty.  The lamb melted in my mouth like butter.  I ordered medium rare and it came out perfectly.  The creme brulee was glazed on top just the right amount and it was a healthy portion.    All in all, this place is probably a tad over my usual budget, but I could definitely go here for special occassions and enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"I've been back twice for their three course meal. I just love the steak! The steak from the angel hair basket isn't as tender or flavorful as this. It's perfectly seasoned with mustard and some other ingredients. It's served with goat cheese mashed potatoes which are also heavenly. Everything goes so well with the sauce. It is truely an amazing dish.  I'm still not so sure about their appitizers and desserts though. I enjoy the taste of fried foie gras but their appitizer is served as is. The souflee is amazing and chocolate tartes are very delicious but over powered my steak. Maybe next time I'll order just the steak, two of them.  I went on a Monday and they had only a handful of tables avaliable. The server told me every Monday and Thursday (I believe) most of the restaurant is booked by companies. I suggest to come on other days.  The meal was only $25! That's a great deal."}
{"text":"You're definitely going to have to fork over some money for this place, but luckily I had a groupon that took the sting off a bit.  And of course it helps that the food was for the most part very good and quite interesting.  My waiter was attentive and very thorough when asked for suggestions.  He almost gave his opinion on every single dish on the menu (maybe a tad much).    I tried the mussels on his suggestion, as well as the scallops because not only do I really like scallops, but they came with a few shavings of truffles, something I've always wanted to try.  The mussels were excellent and generous in size, although my one gripe was that they were $2 more on the bill than they had been listed on the menu.  They were swimming in some yummy sauce and my waiter thankfully kept offering me extra bread to soak it all up.  This was one of the only places that I didn't have to keep asking for bread; the servers would bring me more once they saw I had finished my previous piece.  The scallops were also good; not out of this world, but still tasty and well-cooked.  I wasn't quite overwhelmed by my first black truffle experience.  The flavor was somewhat mild and there were only 2 shavings.  I would've preferred a couple more, along with maybe another scallop (it only came with 2).  I took the waiters suggestion again for my entree and went with the lamb diablo, and I'm very happy I did.  May have been the best lamb I've ever had.  It had a delicious mustard crust and was perfectly tender.  The accompaniments weren't particularly special, but there was plenty of delicious lamb on the plate that I didn't mind.  As for dessert, I couldn't make up my mind, so I decided on the sampler.  It came with a chocolate pecan tart, creme brulee, lemon curd, and almond torte.  I didn't particularly enjoy the torte, but everything else was pretty good, my favorite definitely being the chocolate.    All in all, I had a good experience and a very satisfying meal.  If I win the lottery, I may become a regular, but until then, we'll save this one for super special occasions."}
