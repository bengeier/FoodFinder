{"text":"This is one of the best corned beef sandwiches in the city. The meat is not fatty like some others. The portion is generous and everything is fresh. I love the sandwich from Sam's with chips and a beverage. The cost os reasonable and the location is convenient!"}
{"text":"Sams market has great sandwiches. There is not a lot of fluff to this place. Simple and sweet...but very tasty satisfying sandwiches. I always get the turkey sandwich which is so fresh. It's a great place to grab a quick sandwich on your lunch break or grab a sandwich on the way home from work."}
{"text":"Really cool hidden sandwich shop in the Hill District. The owner is super nice and his ability to take 5 sandwich orders at once without messing any of them up is ridiculous."}
{"text":"If you grew up in black neighborhoods you always had a corner store who makes food and this is what that is but their sandwiches are hands down the best in the city I always come here for a corned beef sandwich and it is so good only place I will go now for corned beef sandwiches if you don't know about this place or never been please go it is well worth it"}
