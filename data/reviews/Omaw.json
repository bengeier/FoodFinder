{"text":"great cocktails, enjoyed the ambiance of the place, service was fine. shrimp and grits tasty (a bit rich for me but i went with a group and we shared many dishes). the dumplings with the truffle was amazing (when truffle is used right, it is a glorius eating experience). i would gladly return for more of dumplings for sure."}
{"text":"Not one to write reviews but couldn't resist the opportunity for therapeutic relief from talking about one of the worst dining experience i've had in some time. It made me soo mad that I actually lost my appetite so I guess I should thank them for helping with the diet. Can't comment on the food as after 45 mins from ordering we only received the corn bread (it was dry so i don't recommend) even though we also ordered the braised ribs and turkey and dumplings at the same time. I can however comment on the service, in an hour we saw our waiter three times. 40 mins went by without the waiter stopping at our table, but the tables beside us received their food, additional drinks etc. Really can't explain why the waiter never came to see us or to explain why the food was taking so long, or to even ask if I wanted another beer or to take away my empty glass. Definitely do not recommend and will never be back."}
{"text":"I had the shredded kale, shrimps and grits, fried chicken, and the spaghetti tapas which were all amazing.  They also carry some great craft beers in bottle."}
{"text":"decided to try OMAW since it's been hitting top lists in toronto.  with high anticipation, OMAW fell short and was full of uninspirational plates.  a very homey touch on food, i felt the food was boring and not innovative in the least.   most items were simple in nature...a bit too simple for the price point and portion size they were offering.   we got 4 dishes to try and 1 dessert.   1. yellowfin tuna - sashimi style tuna with a frozen mint garnish, parsley and other bits that were not memorable. the fish was poorly sliced. 1 large chunk followed by several random diced bits. the mint hid the flavour of the fish.  2. prawns with grits - a cheesey grits with just regular chopped bits of shrimp and broccoli...it tasted like a chunkier broccoli cheddar soup i guess. why broccoli? why put everything in a bowl? it was thrown together in a very unstylist way.  3. turkey and dumplings - another extremely homey style dish with nothing that really sparked interest. very smokey soup which cancelled out the truffle bits. the dumplings were mushy and left me not wanting to finish it.  4. wagyu - the dish i was looking forward to the most. a long thin sashimi slice of beef topped with a plethora of garnishes and cute swirly pancakes. the pancakes were incredibly salty, it did not pair well with the dish at all. very disappointing...all it made me feel was how much i wanted to eat alo's version  more. 5. key lime pie dessert - weirdly enough to me, the best dish of the night.  the dehydrated meringue/coconut bits were yummy, the dish was simple but was well exucuted.   TLDR: not sure what i was expecting i guess. over all the staff was nice and space is lovely. food is so-so."}
{"text":"Surprised to see a few negative reviews here, as we had a lovely experience and definitely plan to return.    Service was attentive and pleasant, as well as knowledgable.    Highlights included the wagyu dish, the mussels on fry bread, and the key lime dessert.  I would return for these alone.  Cocktails were also lovely and balanced, and for the amount we ate and drank, our bill was more than reasonable."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a couple of weeks ago for my friend's birthday.  Tried to make ressies online but the DINR app the resto uses was not the most user friendly.  We walked in and were seated at the bar even though there were open tables.  This turned out to be pretty cool because we were right in front of the chefs throwing beautiful wads of butter into pans as they prepared the meals.   We waited a bit for a server to take our drink order but no one came to us so we had to flag down the host, who then got a server to bring us our drinks.    We ordered the crispy jambalaya, fried chicken, andouille sausage, and beef shortribs.  All dishes were well prepared with the sausage being my favourite.  We also had the chefs describing the dishes to us as they served it.  Pretty neat because our server was MIA.  We had to flag the host again for our second round of drinks which took forever to come.  He probably got lost in the Upside Down with the server.  That round was comped because of the ridiculous time it took to pour out 2 glasses of wine.  All in all, good food, but not so good service.  I still sometimes dream of those beautiful wads of butter."}
{"text":"I am still unsure what type of food this place would be considered as, but that doesn't quite matter cause food was great! Server was friendly and did some really good recommendations. We had the cornbread, aged wagyu, lamb shoulder, turkey dumplings, and there was one more thing but I don't rmb. The aged wagyu was my favourite! Only complain was that there wasn't a lot of lamb in the lamb shoulder pasta. I'd say they do have pretty small portions and they are priced a little high but overall it's still worth a try."}
{"text":"Overall summary:  An Ok but NOT an outstanding meal.  Like others have said, tor the prices charged, the serving sizes of the food were on the small size (yes, we know it's tapas style), and nothing special.  But drink prices (at least the drafts / beer) were reasonable.  And service was good.  We were here with another couple on a Saturday.  Had a reservation, so was assigned one of the two u-shaped booths at the back of the front room (and they added a chair to seat 4 of us).  This was our first time to Omaw, and we were a bit hesitant due to some recent less-than-postive reviews we had read.  Regardless, as it was one of the restaurants on our list to try, we decided to form our own opinions.  There had been comments about service being not very friendly.  We did not experience this at all.  Service was prompt, helpful, and not intrusive.  We did not feel rushed, and all we had to do was look up and someone would quickly approach if we had any questions.  Sadly, the food was just OK.  Standouts were the Fried Jambalaya balls, the beef short rib skewer and the fried squid.  The rest of what we ordered were just OK;  the grits and asparagus were fine, but not memorable;  we found some dishes too saucy:  the aged Wagyu, pork ribs and lamb, covering up the taste of the meat.  The chicken thigh dish (kind of a take on bibimbap) was too sweet.  And the key lime pie totally did not have the tartness of key limes (in fact we had two orders and both were sweet), but the meringue \"cookies\" made for a nice presentation.  With so many great places in Toronto, I'm glad to have tried Omaw, but will not be quick to return."}
{"text":"The unique foods are presented in perfect proportions, and are extremely tasty. Nice ambience, and the staff are friendly and good at their jobs! The chefs are perfect."}
{"text":"One of my new fav spots in the city. Awesome atmosphere, attentive staff including the chefs. We were lucky enough to be seated at the bar to watch the action. Had very engaging conversations with the chefs who were super friendly and interested in how we enjoyed the food. My favourite dish was the wagyu beef, fried chicken (so juicy!!) followed by the mussels. But my husband would say he enjoy the jambalaya which is done in a unique way. Personally the shortrib to me was only ok. But the cooking staff are proud of this dish and highly recommended it so we tried it. The cocktails were yummy! When we come again, I want to try their Tennessee ham and a lot of other things! Great dinner!"}
{"text":"First to the good points:  the atmosphere and the service were good.   Now, to the OK points: the music choices were OK but way too loud. But to the main point:  while the food is creative and tasty, in no way is this a restaurant for dinner.  Each dish/portion is the size of a tapas plate, but priced at a full entree/mains level.  This is precious, self-indulgent food, all about showing off the executive chef's culinary whims and not at all about serving a clientele with any appetite. Perhaps we might not have minded had we been on an expense account, or had drunk so much that we no longer noticed, but we left feeling we had been taken advantage of.  This restaurant is all about the chef, and not about the diner.  We didn't patronize it to be trendy, we went there to eat.  And not at such an expensive price point. And as someone who's lived and eaten all over the US, I sure didn't recognize any of the Southern US cuisines supposedly riffed upon here...."}
{"text":"My wife and I sat at the bar early on a Friday night.  We like sitting at the bar as it's lively and exciting and affords you a front row seat, behind-the-scenes look at a restaurant and who am I kidding? We get our drinks faster is why we like to dine at the bar.  We were witness to highly energetic bartender who I genuinely liked for all his eagerness as he was prepping the staff for the evening. Providing he wasn't too slammed, he'd be available to recommend wine to any diners who needed advice he told the wait staff. One caveat though. Call him the beverage manager. Call him the guy who picks the wine. Just don't call him the sommelier.  Which is fair enough, but his explanation of wines was comprehensive, unfussy, enthusiastic, and way more palatable than anything I have seen from a lot of people who do call themselves a sommelier.  That seems unfair.  Anyway whatever, wine sucks. I'm all about the beer and I liked their taps list.  Simple but effective with a decent variety that seemed to have some thought put into it. I had the Brooklyn Lager, always good, and the excellent Blood Bothers IPA.  They also had some nice bottles on the menu.  Good stuff.  Back to my initial point about sitting at the bar and being a barfly on the wall.  There was one young chef that caught my attention. He worked closest to the bar. I say worked but really he was busting his ass. He seemed to be doing ten times the work of anyone else there while the other chefs ponced about with varying degrees of male bravado as most chefs do. Fair enough. That's how these things go I guess.  But at one point the chef farthest from the bar, one with well-defined triceps and an air of douchery that would make a possum vomit, chastised the younger chef for one thing or another.   Don't get me wrong.    I'm all for offering input.    Constructive criticism is how we all learn and grow.    But this was not that. This was one guy being a condescending jerk to a coworker, and throwing a pan back at him in melodramatic disgust because why not behave like a complete dick in front of customers?  It was uncomfortable and I felt bad for the kid.  I guess it's all part of the yucky bro culture in kitchens that makes me appreciated Grey Gardens all the more.   Anyway the food was decent, The jambalaya wossits were basically dirty rice balls.  Good, but if you fuck up fried rice balls you have a real problem. My wife really enjoyed the mussels on toast.  The ricotta agnolotti was pricey for what it was. But good. I'd give it a B++.  And the kale salad was perfectly dressed, mostly really good, but the puffed rice cereal didn't work for me because it reminded me of puffed rice cereal. I forgot how much I don't like puffed rice cereal.  Not that I'm delusional enough to think that anyone has read this far, but if you have, I'll end on an anecdote:    On the way out we passed Matt Blondin near the entrance who was completely engrossed by his smartphone.    Now don't get me wrong.  He didn't have to.    He was under no obligation.  Maybe he assumed we didn't know who he was.  And I swear it's not just me being needy.  But it would have been nice if he asked how the meal was. Or thanked us for dining there. But he didn't. And that seems like a misstep, to not do something so simple that would have garnered so much good will. I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"I really, really, really wanted to like it. I'm a Chef Matt Blondin fan since Acadia, my all-time favorite Toronto restaurant that closed two years ago (RIP). Acadia was upscale, innovative Southern. This place was a down-market version largely because of service reminiscent of a dive bar.   It's tapas style, and yet they brought all the plates out at the same time. So the grits were crusted jelly by the time we got to them, the jambalaya balls were lukewarm and not exploding with heat, and the \"kentucky fried squid\" was dough-y and bland. I don't even remember the fourth item we had because it wasn't memorable. Oh wait I do-- a piece of corn bread that was too dry. Corn bread. At a southern restaurant. Too dry. Shame.   They have three signature cocktails and the one I tried reminded me of sour, expired pepto bismol with one heavy chunk of ice that prevented me from  drinking it. It's a small detail, fine, and I know you're reading this wondering why this girl is complaining about ice that keeps hitting her poor prissy mouth but restaurants at this level should be all about details. (For excellent cocktails that hit the spot, by the way, try DW Alexander on Church.)  The service was...aggressive. Granted my friend brought her friend when I had reserved only for two and they moved us to a larger table for four without a breath, which was accommodating. But servers didn't smile, make eye contact, or ask us once how the food and drinks were. When I asked to have the ice removed from my drink, I was given a stare-down and then it was deposited on the table afterwards, the server's hand smacked my shoulder. I turned around but she was gone. An accident, I'm sure? Our server cleared our plates before we finished, and only stopped being so aggressive when I asked if there was another party coming shortly (we had only been there 45 mins at that point). She also refused to split the bill in two.   Just disappointed. It's a restaurant, it's about the food and service, and if the food is delivered in a way that doesn't let people enjoy it and the service is dismal, what's the point?"}
{"text":"After an unforgettable foodie experience in the South this past fall, I've been very excited to check this place out and get my grit fix. The 3 of us indulged in the cornbread, ceviche, boudin balls, shrimp and grits, crispy chicken skins, mussels on toast, fried chicken, beef short ribs and the crusted pork. Everything arrived surprisingly fast! We all had our favourites but mine was definitely the mussels on toast - so many different elements that worked magically together. The beef short ribs were very tasty as well, however, the portion size was a little bit smaller than we had imagined. Now, I wanted to love the grits. I really did. But they were a little on the cheesy side and I don't remember tasting any prawns...or grits. Overall, a solid addition to the Ossington strip, beautiful space and awesome service.  As an extra bonus, Omaw will leave you feeling nostalgic from the good ol' nights at LeVack Block. So many memories at this Ossington corner..."}
{"text":"Omaw is a southern style tapas restaurant with inventive dishes and a very nice and intimate ambiance. Would recommend ordering 4-5 dishes for 2 people.    Highlights:  Mussels on Toast ($13):  this was soooo good and my fav dish of the evening. The baguette toast was crispy and loaded with mussels. The chow chow ( relish) on top kind of tasted like caramelized onions and complemented the mussels really well. There was so much flavour with each bite.   Snake River Farms Wagyu ($16): This dish was really creative- similar to a beef carpaccio but also served with mini flapjack pancakes that you put the wagyu on. Although the dish was really tasty, there was so much garnish on the wagyu that it really overpowered the beef and I could barely taste the meat. Still worth a try.   Lowlights:  Fried Chicken Skins ($7): this dish was ok, but I would only recommend ordering for a group of 3-4+ as I got sick of it after a few bites. The taste and texture was similar to deep fried calamari but without the octopus.   Short Ribs ($14): I was expecting traditional bone in short-ribs and was disappointed by this dish. The meat was served on a skewer and tasted bland. Definitely not worth $14.   Fried Chicken ($16): This was a highlight that turned into a lowlight. The chicken was seasoned perfectly, very crispy on the outside and the meat was really juicy and moist. Unfortunately, it was not cooked all the way through and the middle was raw. We told the server and he immediately took it back and advised that they would make it again for us. Although this was a major no no, the staff handled the situation really well and even offered to comp our entire meal ( yes, you read that correctly). This shows me that they really stand behind their quality and service. The chicken the 2nd time around was executed perfectly.   Overall, this restaurant is good to try once or as a late night snack with friends ( drinks are really yummy!). The pricing is a bit steep for what you get and there are many other good restaurants that I would rather go to in that price bracket."}
{"text":"We had a good time at Omaw and will be back.  We were a group of 6 and came this past Friday. Even though we goofed our reservation (we reserved a table for 4, instead of 6), the restaurant accommodated us the best they could with no attitude.  As the place, of course I love it because the space used to be Levack Block and is nostalgic for me.  They've also done a great job of stylishly renovating it to feel cozy/intimate.  We went during prime time and the restaurant was definitely packed, including the bar... so I recommend making a reso.  The food was solid.  Here is a quick-overview:  - Cornbread: good and the spread is tasty - Winter vegetables/roots: really good with a pleasant sauce to accompany - Fried chicken: everyone does a good job of fried chicken now, so this was on par with industry - Pork ribs: these were okay and probably my least favorite dish - Short ribs:  these were amazing! I could have had this as my main meal. Everyone at the table agreed. We ordered a second round and is the reason why I would come back.  Again, I love this place because of its past, the current ambiance, and the good food. We also had lovely service - they were pleasant and attentive.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Love the new menu and newly renovated space. Fits very well on the Ossington strip. My favourites were the toast,the crudo and the butterscotch tart. Definitely recommend giving the new omaw a try."}
{"text":"So good! I was here a couple of weeks ago and I don't remember exactly what I had, but I remember:   Aged waygu - delicious. It was like an orgy in my mouth and everyone was invited. I would love to come back here just to have this again.   Gulf prawns - good but not amazing. I don't really remember it now so I guess that speaks for itself...  Something with pesto and fettuccine - this was good too! I remember thinking this dish was a little too expensive for what it was.   All in all it was a great dining experience. I think the portions should be bigger for the price that they charge but ingredients were great, flavours were well-paired. I would come back."}
{"text":"The food and service was great.  Everything we had was delicious! My favourites were the crispy jambalaya and the shrimp and grits. Southern comfort food elevated. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"came back to this place again on saturday night after a six month hiatus -- and the menu was amazing. absolutely loved the heirloom tomatoes and the kentucky fried squid. the beef short ribs - always a staple for me when i come here and just as good as when i tried it the first time. guy at the bar was killing it (in a good way) with serving our specialty drinks and we kept ordering more. service was attentive and yet not in your face which as also great. we love the ambiance of the place and the old school hip hop in the background. i'll keep going back."}
{"text":"Good food, tapas style. I really enjoyed this place, I just don't agree with the price points for what you receive. There is nothing too exciting on the menu, but it is all well prepared. Id recommend this place for a quick drink and snack at the bar but not a full on meal. Would go back if friends wanted to, but wouldn't be a choice of mine."}
{"text":"Cool little bar/restaurant on the Ossington strip. The back room opens up to a hidden large dining room. I sat on the bar, where you get a front row seat for the food preparation, cooking and plating.   The kitchen team worked very well together and put a high amount of detail and care into each plate. The food was all very fresh and consistent with each order. Sitting on the bar, the line cook responsible for each menu item would check in and see how we were enjoying it. Overall service was excellent and food timing was perfect. Food portions are what is to be expected in a modern younger establishment. However the overall food quality was average. All the food was enjoyable, but nothing blew us away.   There is no parking and Ossington is very busy, so arrive early and expect to circle around the block before finding a space. Or better yet take public transportation.  I had an enjoyable time, however the food was not very memorable and I won't likely return. Shortly after experiencing Omaw, I was wondering what else is new and exciting.   Recommendations - Fried Chicken - Duck and Dumpling - Seared Scallops - Key Lime Pie"}
{"text":"The chicken fried squid is an A+ and the Jambalaya is excellent. Also a great vibe in this place...."}
{"text":"4 of us went for dinner...not sure who does the food ordering, the restaurant literally had run out of more than half the food on the menu (our reservation was for 8pm on a Saturday). Service was so slow, the food came out before our wine...had to ask for cutlery....lol serving 101 guys.....this place ranks low in comparision to other places to eat on Ossington- dont waste your money on this place #sorrynotsorry"}
{"text":"Great vibe, delicious food and excellent service.  Upon waiting to be seated the bartender kindly took our drink order right away and started a conversation. Before we knew it, our table was ready! We shared a 3-4 dishes among 3 people, delicious flavour, excellent presentation and a wide selection. However, the portions were quite small for the price we were paying. Would have loved for them to be a tad bigger. Nonetheless, the food was excellent and we could see everything being made right in front of us.  Also, I went a second time for a group dinner and the food was extremely consistent and just as delicious - making this a reliable dinner spot.   Cocktail selection is also amazing!"}
{"text":"Best food I've had in a long long time. Killer chef. Beef dish was to die for. They use a Japanese grill with Japanese charcoal. Chopped salad is worth going just for that. Going again next week"}
{"text":"Interesting concept but unfortunately too much time is spent on how the dish looks instead of how it tastes. The dishes are small and yet meant to be shared. I recommend about 5 dishes between two people as the portions are so small. The food is good but not memorable. They should add more fresh vegetables to their dishes as their tomato salad is the only fresh item."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical given some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised by the food. My friend had been here before so I guess she knew the right things to get. Everything was interesting unique and delicious. the restaurant was kind enough to accomoddate and any all preferences. I don't eat pork and one of their mayo that the jambalaya was served on, had pork in it, which they accidentally brought out and then came back immediately with a vegetarian version for me. I was just going to wipe it off or something honestly but I was very pleased with their extra effort.   Service was good as well. Prices turned out to be pretty decent for all the food we shared. Definitely go with a few folks and share plates"}
{"text":"You give 5 stars to a restaurant when they fulfill 3 basic criterias; good food, good service and not that heavy on a wallet. Omaw fulfills all those criterias..their beef vagyu is amazing and their Tuesdays fried chicken ($2 a piece) is a great deal..their cocktails are good too especially old fashioned drinks"}
{"text":"Loved the food! The biggest show stoppers for me were the turkey dumplings and the wagyu beef.  Omg... So delicious, so flavourful, everything about both dishes were absolute perfection. They were like flavour explosions! The Kentucky fried squid was very good as well. It had just the right amount of sauce on it, not drenched and not dry.... Just right to give the right flavour and squid cooked perfectly!  We had the beef short rib which was tasty, but the dumplings and wagyu were so exceptional that I can't stop thinking about them! We also got the asparagus but it was too spicy for me (but I am a total spiciness wimp...I always get zero spiciness if I have a choice so I'm not a good judge of spicy stuff.) The key lime pie was beautiful and tasted great too, I loved the meringue pieces, yummy and beautiful! I'm really shocked at the bad reviews, the staff were super friendly and attentive and the food was amazing! Maybe it was just growing pains of just opening? I definitely want to try their Sunday family style next time!"}
{"text":"I attended a work dinner at Omaw on a Thursday night. Drinks was decently priced and mixed well, nothing ground breaking and also does not seem to have South American reference as the restaurant claims. I am a vegetarian and from what I heard when the reservation was made the restaurant claims that it provides vegetarian option. However I was informed in the restaurant that they DO NOT offer alteration/ substitution, they also DO NOT offer a separate vegetarian menu (everything on the menu has some kind of meat in it except their over priced and overly salty corn bread). They do offer 'option' to take the meat off their menu items and they only have 3 things on their menu that you can do that. I ordered the deep fried Jambalaya balls and the Lamb Ragu wiith pasta without the lamb. Both items are overloaded with salt and pasta was over cooked. They did not increase the portion of the pasta even it is without the meat. And when we got the bill we figured that the price for the vegetarian dish is the same as with meat, even they put zero effort into altering the dish and the portion remains as small as in the dish has its meat counter part in it.   I found it hard to believe that it is 2016 and they offer no vegetarian option on their menu, claim that they are a vegetarian friendly restaurant when they are not. And even have the nerve to charge the same price when half of the dish is missing."}
{"text":"Omaw is located on west side of the Ossington street at the corner of Humbert which is between Argyle and Queen W (Ossington Strip).  While you have Bloor, Queen, King, Dundas and College and any other street that runs east and west with so many places to eat and drink, this little village of the Ossington Strip really has changed and become more alive over the past short while.    Not far from the other recognizable Ossington landmarks between Dundas and Queen like Bellwoods Brewery and Bang Bang, Omaw comes across as a more upscale, quieter and classic type of place.  The menu is short and simple but with a variety of choices from a chicken sandwich to veggies options.    Having already ate and just looking to get drinks the place was rather full both for tables and at the bar so rather than just not being able to accommodate, they opened up a back room for us with a large table capable of seating 10 for only 5 of us.  This room is away from the regular bar and was attached to another private room behind us.  This private space would be perfect for a quiet dinner for 10 or so.  While the room didn't have much ventilation, we simply asked if something could be done and shortly after the AC was turned on for us.  It was understandable it wasn't on in the first place being that the room was unoccupied previously.  Just drinks but we also did get a slice of that mango pie.  It was like a key lime and had the consistency but it wasn't tart as that but the crust was incredibly good.  We were appreciative that although we didn't have dinner and just wanted drinks, Omaw was able to accommodate us with an on the spot table for us in the back."}
{"text":"OMAW is a trendy restaurant in Ossington serving southern inspired tapas and great cocktails. If there's room, I would recommend asking to be seated in the backroom. The backroom transport you to another time and place.   We went with a big group so we had the opportunity to sample the menu. The highlight was the fried chicken which was seasoned perfectly, very crispy on the outside and the meat was really juicy and moist. I would highly recommend the fried chicken.  The keylime pie was a piece of art and was delicious. The tartness and sweetness was well-balanced.  Overall, OMAW is an enjoyable evening out. It is a place for good food and drinks with good friends."}
{"text":"Decided to make a last minute pop in Saturday night for dinner once the crazy downpour took place and no patio seemed appealing. As always, reservations are definitely recommended however, we got lucky and there were 2 seats available at the bar.  The restaurant is small, but it has a nice vibe to it -- friendly, good music and cozy.   Started with a glass of the cab, but soon made the switch to the Merlot after the recommend (much better choice). It was busy so the service was a bit slow until all the food we ordered came out at once. It's sharing portions and they recommend 2 dishes per person. We had the fried chicken, which was really juicy and flavorful. The beef ribs were decent. I found that there wasn't a ton of meat on them and then the pork shoulder was also enjoyable.   The menu changes seasonably, I believe but I loved as I sat by the bar, I could watch all the cooking magic happen.   Definitely a great spot for a small bite or drinks. Their cocktail menu was pretty extensive...and no one's complaining about that!"}
{"text":"Quite a good restaurant. Prices are pretty reasonable and portions are good. We only needed 5 tapas to be full and to be honest we could have been fine with 4. Service was excellent. No issues there. Food was good and they tried to put a modern twist on classic southern cooking."}
{"text":"This place was beyond my expectations. The presentation was stunningly beautiful and the food was surprisingly great (not that I was think it'd taste bad.  They are very creative with their food and their  cocktails go well with their dishes. The bartender makes great recommendations to your orders and the food itself evokes tastes unimaginable.   It's like going into a new world and experiencing flavors that you've never could think of. Two things you must get are the Jambalaya and the Fois Gras! The Jambalaya was presented in a very unique way but the balls bursted in your ball. The Fois Gras was so smooth and soft that it just melted in your mouth.   All in all, this place was probably the best dining experience of my life. 10/10 would come again. I would recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place since it's opened and finally had a chance to last Tuesday. We ordered 5 dishes for 2 people plus a beer and a glass of wine. In order of preference:   1) Pork ribs: the meat was very flavorful on its own and does not have to rely on sauce. Not too much kimchi either. Loved it. 2) Wagyu carpaccio: flavors came together well but had to scrape away a bit of the topping at times to taste the beef. 3) Crab salad: tasty, liked the pairing with melon with the creamy crab, and crunchy bread. 4) Jambalaya: cool presentation but did not find it tasty. 5) Fried squid: too much batter, chewy squid, felt like over-priced calamari.  The table can be small and awkward for more than 2 plates at a time. The service was good despite the restaurant being busy, but we both left a little hungry."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend on Thursday and had an amazing time. Service was incredible and they suggested some cocktails which were great!   We had the toast and rutabaga to start and ordered the crudo and mussels to share. Everything looked as good as it tasted! It was great before the reno but even better now. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Brutal. We basically ordered most of the menu between the 4 of us. The cornbread tasted like shrimp, but in a bad way; the pork ribs were so salty I couldn't eat them. The short ribs were salty and tasteless. The shrimp and grits were good, but as a food blogger and recipe developer I can confidently say that those are super easy to make. The dumplings were okay.  The 5 vegetables as a side? They're cold. Wth is the chef thinking? Unless it's a salad, a vegetable side (or any side) should be served hot. Plus, it had a tasteless purée under the stack of vegetables that was listed on the menu as 'fresh cheese' but tasted like nothing. Desserts - key lime pie and a brownie - were good but predictable and not amazing. I'm not sure who would think this food is good. Even the people next to us weren't finishing their plates. Pass."}
{"text":"Delicious drinks. Had several on the menu, and all of them were amazing. The pisco drink went down so smooth, as did the desert rose.  Perfect combination of sweet, really intricate garnish on top, and the right amount of alcohol. Onto the food: the jambalaya balls were out of this world. Delicious flavors and you have no idea what you're in for when you see them on your plate. Fried chicken was too fried and pretty standard. Tasty, essentially what you'd expect, but after the other dishes being fairly unique I would've thought there was something more distinctive about the fried chicken than what I could get somewhere else. The dish needs to be \"omawed\" somehow... changed up, optimized! The soup was delicious. I have a new relationship and respect for squash. Also had the pork dumplings, which were soupy, totally delicious, and fortunately there were only four I think on the plate, but really good.  Maybe the only criticism is the bill was a bit on the steep side, but we got at least four drinks which definitely added to it. Maybe the drink prices can be cut down a bit, but otherwise the food here is amazing, the atmosphere is awesome, particularly if you can get into the front half of the restaurant with the bar, and those jambalaya balls. Oh yesss."}
{"text":"The service here was shockingly bad. We decided to have a seat a the bar. The restaurant was quiet, not even a third  full. There were 11 staff, 7 behind the bar  serving maybe 25 people. We waited for over 15 minutes without anyone acknowledging our presence, never mind taking a drink order. Fed up with being ignored, we finally left and went next door to Odd Seoul, where we were served within 5 minutes by the one bartender working, who was serving a packed bar/restaurant.  In conclusion, the service was inexcusable. I will never go back. In fact, I have never left a review before, ever, on any platform. But oh, Omaw, how you inspire one to broaden horizons."}
{"text":"Go for the grits & prawns, calamari, fried chicken and key lime pie. Solid service, friendly staff and tasty food."}
{"text":"For a table for 2 on a Saturday night, we luckily got a table within 5 mins without a reservation. We sat near the window on some bar stools near the door, which made for great people watching and lovely light, since the restaurant itself it quite dark.   We order a bunch of things and shared. We got the smoked turkey with dumplings which came with a bit of broth, it tasted like an upscale version of what would be made at home. The kentucky fried squid was crispy and well-seasoned. The pork ribs were delicious, it was tender and sticky, the fried onions on top gave it some more texture and the slaw was tangy, cripsy and fresh. The best part of dessert, the key lime pie was so beautiful and almost couldn't eat it. The pie itself had great lime flavour without being overbearing and the white yogurt crisps that surround it look architectural and contrasts against the minimalist black plate.   The meal never felt rushed, we were probably there for more than 2 hours. Even the sun had set but there were candles on the table which gave the table an even more intimate atmosphere. The service was great but yes their prices are not for everyday meals but makes a lovely dinner out."}
{"text":"One of the many, many great bars in the Trinity-Bellwoods area. Like many other places in the vicinity, you'll get small portions of very tastefully prepared food, as well as a great selection of \"upscale\" cocktails.  I've been here multiple times and I've tried pretty much every cocktail on the menu. All of them are pretty good. The bartenders are really nice about suggesting cocktails depending on which kinds of spirits/flavours you enjoy. You can also be adventurous and ask the bartender to make you something they made up.  As for food, you can't go wrong with the fried chicken. No one ever regretted ordering fried chicken (until they step on the scale).  All in all, OMAW is a great place that I consistently recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Definitely get the tasting menu - it's really good and a great portion size too. I recommend sitting in the front room - the vibe is really nice. Went here for my husband's 40th birthday and as foodies, we both loved it!"}
{"text":"Second time having dinner here and it was just as good as the first time. This restaurant/bar has great cocktails and southern inspired tapa-like dishes. It's great for sharing. Ordered my favorite crispy jambalaya. It looks like large black matte marbles, and tastes like creamy spicy rice on the inside with a crunchy exterior. The texture has a nice contrast. Also ordered my favorite southern grits dish, but this time it was updated from last visit. Today, there was a chilled prawn mixture on top of a fried grits patty. Loved the creamy cheesy grits as usual. Next up was the duck and dumpling in a broth. This is shredded duck with something like gnocchi in a soup, very enjoyable if you like duck flavors. Also tried the new pork and coleslaw, and it wasn't what I expected. It came out looking more like a salad than an entree, very creative flavors of thinly sliced smoke pork layered with tangy coleslaw and roasted pine nuts. It reminded me of both Asian and southern influences. The ambiance is soft, chill and romantic. To make the experience even more relaxing, the service is great. The wait staff are very attentive and the chef will chat with you if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a drink with a friend. The drinks were okay. I really appreciated the heavy lavender flavour in the fly by night. The staff are very nice people here--so nice that I will go back to eat."}
{"text":"This place is dope, f the haters. I've always loved Matt Blondins's dishes and this didn't disappoint.  Faves were shrimp grits, heirloom tomatoes, dumplings, wagyu beef, key lime pie."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place so much... I have been wanting to try Chef's food for the longest time and this was the perfect opportunity... but I was really turned off from the moment our server came by. Her attitude was really fake, and she spent a lot of the time flirting with the guy sitting next to us. When she checked on us, it was like she was rhyming the same lines in a very fake voice.. a major turnoff like we were not good enough to be taking up the seats in a newly, highly aclaimed restaurant.  The cocktails were great, no doubt about that - crafty, original and very tasty.  We started with the famous \"shrimp and grits\"... and it was way too heavy, and overpriced for the portion. The texture was okay, but I felt like it tasted like cheesy eggs more than anything.  Sigh.. im so sad having to write this review... but it goes to show that a great chef can have a bad day, and terrible customer service can ruin any night, regardless of who you're with."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Sunday prix fixe dinner for $35. Thought it was a good price for the amount of food you get. We were stuffed by the time the dessert came. The menu included salad, grits, fried chicken, meat pie, collard greens and pineapple dessert. All had diff flavours and very well presented. Fav was probably the fried chicken and dessert. To our surprise we quite enjoyed the grits too. There's also live music on Sunday evenings!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance of this little place. Think intimate and relaxed. The old school hip hop they were playing was great. The vibe was fun for sure but that's where it ended for me. We had an early reservation but by the time we left the place was jammed. Obviously they're doing something right.   I guess I had higher expectations knowing the chef was Matt Blondin. I loved Acadia but felt this menu was a step down from that. I have to say that I'm not really a big fan of the Tapas style that has become so ubiquitous in the city, and with good reason. It's a clever way to get people to spend more. With each dish at around 15 bucks and the waiters suggestion to get three dishes per person... I'm just saying I feel like if I were to order a $45 entree, I'd be expecting something a lot better than most of these so-so tasters. My problem with a lot of tapas menus is that it's hard to get a coherent group of dishes. Most are good standing on their own, but together, it's just a foody mish-mash.  The other non-plus about tapas is all the clutter of dishes on the table. As a result, there was only enough room for small bread dish sized plates to eat from which were paired with large heavy utensils. Every time I tried to rest my giant fork on the edge of my itty bitty plate, it fell onto the table with a clatter. Awkward.   So about the food: We started off with the corn bread and the beef short ribs. The ribs were pretty good. Tender with a crust of coarse cornmeal and served with a light horseradish cream. The corn bread, on the other hand, was very salty and heavy on the baking soda which left an unpleasant aftertaste. I left it rejected on its plate after one bite.   The stone crab carbonara was a beautifully presented dish and my favourite of the plates we ordered. It's a nice creamy fettuccine sprinkled with black walnuts served inside a crab shell nestled on a bed of salt. If there was in fact any crab in this dish, I couldn't tell. But it tasted very good so I'm not complaining. Plus it was so appealing to the eye and that scores big points for me.   We ended with the 5 veg dish which was a little confusing to me as the various vegetables ranged in temperature from ice cold pureed something at the bottom to slightly cooler than room temp cooked cabbage in the middle to luke-warm baby carrots. It was topped with a bit of quinoa which I liked. I found it to be a nice refreshing dish for the end of the meal. The flavour was very good, just would have been better if it was all chilled to the same temp.   Sorry, guys. I feel like I'm complaining a lot for a 3-star review but I call it how I see it. I will probably still go back with a little different game plan. I'd go more for the drinks and the music and maybe order one dish instead of two or three."}
{"text":"We came here at the recommendation of a trusted friend and eagerly anticipated our meal while seated at the bar. I like a bar seat with a sightline into the kitchen and enjoy watch the dishes being prepared. I am a visual person and seeing the finished plates inspires me to ask questions and discover what is in each dish. I love that the menu is limited to under 15 items - a sign that each dish is carefully curated and prepared. Luckily, we sat near one of the owner/investors and he gave us his insider recommendations on how to pair our foods. It was a terrific experience to get inside the mind of the chef and listen to his story on how he selected the menu and the inspiration behind the pairings. Oh and the food... 5 stars! Cocktails were not bad either :)"}
{"text":"Classy place.  A bit too showy, and the hipster crowd was partly annoying, but a good place to have a drink and some food on the Ossington.  Drinks are priced like everywhere in downtown.  Food is priced a bit higher, but the ingredients are amazing, fresh and flavorful, and it can be tasted that the dishes were cooked by a professional chef - just the right amounts and ratios of flavors and textures.  The corn bread comes in a skillet and is very good (as plain cornbreads go!)"}
{"text":"We were in the midst of a pretty epic St. Paddy's day pub/restaurant crawl when we stumbled upon Omaw. We walked in and were immediately seated at a prime spot at the bar. Score!  We decided to try a few things:  Toast (\"Caramelized Ricotta, Mushroom, Fermented Chili\"): Okay, this pretty much knocked our socks off. The generous assortment of the various toppings works so well together, and honestly, I could've eaten about a dozen of these things.  Kentucky Fried Squid (\"Green Tomato, Peanut, Scallion\"): This is also an above-average dish, although it's not mind-blowing. It tastes like a better-than-usual interpretation of fried calamari, but I suppose I was expecting something a little closer to fried chicken based on its name. Still, I ate the hell out of this dish.  Pork Belly (\"Burnt Garlic, Zucchini, Mizuna\"): God bless pork belly. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and the accompanying elements only enhanced the deliciousness of the dish. The problem was, though, that the pork belly had been cut horizontally in three pieces, which meant that one piece was just fat, another was just meat, and only the third piece contained a bit of both. This meant I got the just fat piece and my dining companion got the just meat piece, so that aspect of the dish wasn't great.  The vibe and service at Omaw is pretty great, too. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday with my wife and they only served a prix fixe menu.  The courses consisted of a biscuit with an andouille sausage gravy as the starter, a beef brisket and pork ribs (served with coleslaw and cremed corn) for the main, and a peach cobbler with ice cream for the dessert.  The price was $35 per head.   Not sure how the food tastes on the regular menu is, but the prix fixe was pretty disappointing. The biscuit with gravy had good flavor but the temperature was not hot enough, and the biscuits was a bit chewy.  The main was probably the saddest part of the meal, especially the pork ribs - the flavour was bland, and the meat wasn't even fall off the bone.  The beef brisket, sliced thinly like bacon strips, were very dry.  Both the coleslaw and the corn were average and nothing to write home about.  The dessert perhaps could have bumped this up to 3 stars, but also fell flat - it was just ok.  Maybe my expectations were higher.   The service was also fairly average, there were some basic things that I feel like could have improved as well.  For example, the placement of the cup/glasses should have been on the right hand side for both guests when setting the table (but instead were all on one side, so it was to the left of my wife). The other thing that I had a minor issue with were the size of their plates / bowls used.  For the starter (biscuit with gravy) and the main course (brisket and ribs), all the guests were expected to use a 4 inch diameter plate to eat the food... This is not the easiest when trying to cut up the meat when you are also trying to have the coleslaw and the creamed corn... Couldn't they afford larger plates?  Not to mention that it made all the sauces mix together into a bit of a mess on the plates.  Could have made a difference if the staff offered to replace the plates after the starter.  Pretty 101 stuff.  Aside from that, the waiter was friendly, so no issues there.   All in all, with drinks, tax and tip, this was about $60 per person for a fairly average fare.  You could do better having a Cuban sandwich at La Cubana and finishing with an ice cream cookie sandwich at Bang Bang around the area for a third of the price.   Again, this review is for the prix fixe menu only."}
{"text":"Great food for someone that loves trying lots of plates - the food is adventitious, with lots of flavor. Portions are large and do not lend well to trying several different plates."}
{"text":"I've visited Omaw on a several ocassions (dinner with a friend, for a friend's birthday, and took my parents) and was always pleased with the food and service every time. If you're able to sit at the chef's table, do so, as it's such a treat to watch how all the food is beautifully executed, brought to you and explained by one of the chefs or cooks. The servers and bartender are also fairly good in recommending a good cocktail or wine to pair off what you're feeling for!   I have ate at the restaurant to enjoy eating both a la carte as well as doing the tasting menu with my parents; if you're one who's confused with what to order (as all the choices sound sublime!) I reccomend doing the tasting so you get to try a little bit of everything, and it's a fair price of $65 for an 8 course tasting menu.   If you're not up for the tasting menu and are just looking to share food with a date, things to deffinetly try are the mussels on toast, wagyu, sea bream, turkey and dumpling soup (my absolute favorite!), trout and chicken stuffed with pistachio. Don't forget to save space for the key lime pie."}
{"text":"I am not a huge bread fan but I am still having dreams about their incredible bread.  We had it with the clams and the bread, which I found out was dipped in bone marrow was absolutely incredible.  The Lamb Shank is another great choice for anyone looking for sharing sensations.   Paper plane was the drink of choice!"}
{"text":"I went to Omaw for dinner (party or two) on a Friday night. It was very busy and I would suggest you make a reservation before going... The food was quite good and the service was excellent in my opinion. We ordered the following items:  gulf prawns (anson  mills grits,  pimento cheese,  broccoli) - probably my favourite in the list - very southern, very rich, very delicious  asparagus (american xo, chicken hollandaise, crack/in' ) - this one was interesting, the asparagus was shaved and had a little hint of spiciness to it  beef shortrib (variations of corn, horseradish, sugarcane) - this dish was really good, they came out as four beef cubes on a skewer (wish there were more)  sea bream (green  tomato, melon  vinegar,  black olive, parsley)  - this had a ceviche feel to it, not bad but i've had better in the city  We were told the portions were above average for shareable plates, but I would say they were about average. So that was a bit of let down. The four dishes we ordered were enough to fill us, but we weren't really hungry going in - if that helps at all... :)  I would re-visit Omaw I'm curious about other items they offered that we weren't able to try..."}
{"text":"Had the Sunday set dinner menu today. Everything was great from the service (all staff were friendly, smiley, attentive and efficient), decor, and food was excellent. The food all came really quickly, which we really liked because we're ravenous.  That was good so that you could eat a little bit of this and that all together in a shared fashion. For Southern food, it still felt very healthy and balanced even though it typically is very rich. Half the dishes were vegetable based. The collard greens were flavourful and although the sound of licorice cream did not appeal to me, it paired very well with the bacon and greens.  The meatloaf was the best meatloaf I have had. The entire meal was very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"My experience at OMAW was a little conflicting, a little like their menu. The only way I could think to describe it, is haute-cuisine meets southern classics? Was here for a birthday and went for the tasting menu, which was impressively priced at $65 for 6 or 7 courses. Standouts were definitely the mussels on toast, candied squash with tarragon purée and smoked ricotta, and the turkey and dumpling soup. The mussels were fresh and marinated perfectly, squash was intensely flavourful and perfectly matched with the aromatic purée and rich ricotta, and the soup definitely pulled on some nostalgic diner strings with some extra refinement and balance in the execution.  Other courses included the wagyu done in a carpaccio style, a sous-vide chicken breast with gravy and veggies, and the jambalaya rice balls. In all honesty all of these dishes were good, but may have missed the mark compared to their counterparts. All in, wonderful meal, the service was a little wonky but I'm aware serving a group as large as ours presents its out challenges, and the staff was gracious enough to compensate some of the drinks. I don't know if I'd come back, but I enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Omaw for awhile now, but then I had a baby and any chance of eating out at a nice restaurant went out the door. I came here with four girlfriends to celebrate a friend's birthday and the service was exceptional. I really wanted to try their tasting menu but it requires the whole table to do it, so we ordered a la carte instead. The food was good, although one of my friends didn't really enjoy her trout so they gave her some jambalaya instead, which was nice. The highlight on the menu was the key lime pie though; a must try."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: upscale classic; includes blue velvet bank seating in the back.   Food: incredible fusion cuisine. Although portions are small, I was satisfied. I would say it costs ca. $50/pp to dine. You can tell that a lot of thought has gone into the items offered on their seasonal menu (see attached picture); to note: the mussels on frybread are incredible. On an interesting and impressive not, I found that many of the dishes change in palate as you chew.   Overall: I looking forward to returning; friendly service, upscale dining experience."}
{"text":"Omaw! amazing food! can't come here and not try the 'Wing'. creative share plates and great service, cocktails are pretty awesome too. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price. Everything is super fresh and innovative. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very unique food and good for groups. When you have a group of 8 or more you are required to do a set menu. We did the $50 option and overall the food was pretty good and unique. My favourite plates were the trout tartare and chopped salad. To be quite honest the size portions were pretty small. Having done a few tasting menus, this was the first time I wasn't overly full and I'm not a big eater. So if you have an appetite, you definitely need the $60 tasting menu. The food was good, but not too memorable and is also pretty pricy. It's a place to try once."}
{"text":"3.5/5 - fine and competent, but not special enough to return.  Food - we ordered the wagyu (somewhat bland carpaccio-style served with very tasty pancakes), duck and dumplings (so-so dumplings, in a delicious broth), beef short ribs (moist, flavourful - very good), and the fried chicken (crispy coating, tender, juicy meat and - best of all:  boneless).  Portion size - very very small. Except for the fried chicken, the plates are all the size of small appetizers.  For example, the beef tenderloin compared to four pieces of large sushi.  Service - very friendly and entertainingly sassy, but forgetful. Our server took our drink orders twice and still brought the wrong ones.  She also asked for our food order, three different times.   Atmosphere - the front is a little loud.  But we were in the back on the these great banquettes. The washrooms are stylist and modern.  If you're a group of women (and there were a lot) looking for a night out on Ossington, and having a few drinks, and something to snack on, it's good.   But for a full dinner with hungry guys, skip it."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of the food at Acadia. The standard here is equally high, with added pluses of a nice ambiance -- dark and candlelit with a low din -- and well-crafted wine/beer/drink list.  Easy addition to my relatively short list of Toronto restaurants worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Despite hearing good things from friends/colleagues, I found the food here to be disappointing. The food was neither visually pleasing nor balanced in flavor. I sent back a dish that was supposed to be waygu beef because it was topped in so much sauce you couldn't taste the thinly sliced beef. I was also unhappy with a \"deconstructed\" jambalaya that came in the form of rice balls - the only flavor that came through was that of vinegar and it had none of the authentic flavors of real jamabalaya (e.g. andouile sausage). The final straw was a dish that was titled \"gulf prawns\" - it was meant to be a play on shrimp and grits but the dish appeared an a bowl of mush with only two tiny pieces of shrimp. I was very unhappy about the meal and let my waitress know. She notified the manager who kindly comped our meal. The fact that the service was so nice is the silver lining in it all. I hate to be negative but this was just not what I expected given the ambiance/location/menu."}
{"text":"Cool space. We had the corner table. Went with my aunt, fiancé and friend. All foodies. All very excited. The menu looked intriguing.  Great whiskey selection.   Mussels on toast. Tasty. Wagyu beef was quite salty but on a second visit it was less so. The sea bream dish was cool - looked like underwater alien food. Really liked this - not intensely flavourful but still satisfying. Loved the kale salad. The fried chicken wasn't bad but nothing to write home about.   Overall - worth a visit. I enjoyed it both times. But for some reason I'm just not that impressed. Not a favourite but not bad either. I hear they have a tasting menu now - maybe will try again! Could use a few more cool dishes to try - maybe change up the menu a bit - the chefs are talented here and capable of more"}
{"text":"Meh. Too many places trying to reinvent and reconfigure classics. Flavours were fine, ingredients good, service average, price high. Prediction: will be gone and forgotten in a couple years."}
{"text":"We came with friends and really enjoyed both the food and the space.  The crispy jambalaya was unique and exceptionally delicious (we tried both the vegetarian and non-veg versions and actually preferred the vegetarian).  The standout for me was the shredded kale.  I could live on it and this is from someone who would never choose a salad as a top choice elsewhere. Its expensive, but given the quality of experience and service, its worth it."}
