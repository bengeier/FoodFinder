{"text":"Came for brunch with my family & will definitely be back if we're in town! Nice atmosphere, small ma&pa feel, LOW prices almost couldn't believe it when I saw the menu $5.19 for 3 eggs, 3 sausage, 3 bacon, homefries, & toast! Food was good & was ready in 5-10 minutes for all 3 of us! 6/5 stars"}
{"text":"3.5  Service: Pretty good esp since there was only 1 lady running all tables at the beginning(the restaurant was half full). She was also very nice and checked on me and my company a few times.   Food: I ordered the eggs benedict. I was pretty impressed. It was way better than Cora's! But just note, that you should substitute the potatoes. The potatoes almost ruined it for me. It was mushed up homefries...bleh. The portions are very filling though.   My company ordered scrambled eggs & corn beef..however didn't like the potatoes, but everything else was alright. My company actually liked Cora's better.    Overall: I would probably come here again, if I was in the neighborhood. However, I wouldn't go out of my way just to come here.   *Just note, there VERY LIMITED parking. If anything, you would just have to park on the neighborhood streets behind the restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this diner because it has great food at decent prices. More specifically, I like to order the Chicken Souvlaki with Greek Salad because it is tasty and they do not skimp on the sauce! More specifically, they give you generous portions of feta cheese and homemade white sauce, which makes the meal worth it.  They also have hot and crispy french fries with a delicious gravy sauce that puts other poutineries to shame. I will always be a lifelong customer because the food is delicious and more importantly, it is a family owned restaurant.They are packed during the weekends because it specializes in all-day breakfast, so you may have to wait in line. However, during the weekdays it's nice and quiet so you don't feel compelled to rush through your meal.   The reason why I rated it 4/5 instead of 5 is because of the wait staff. Depending on your server, it can either be pleasant  or snarky (usually from the older waitresses). The washroom needs to be reworked as well.    I'd rather go to Steve's than fast food chains because I've worked at a family business and I've experienced the hardship of competing with big food chains like McDonalds, Harveys, Subway, and etc.   Quick Tips: 1. Arrive early if you want to breakfast/brunch during the weekend, otherwise you'd have to wait 10-15 mins.   2. Go there during the weekdays when it's not so crowded to enjoy a pleasant and quiet dinner.   Conclusion: Show your support by going to this quaint and classy diner!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Steve's.  It has that old-school Cleveland steel mill feel to it.  The food is great, big breakfasts, gyros, and nice sandwiches with free all-you-can-eat home-made soup.  The servers are really nice, and you can get in and out quickly.  Unbelievable prices too, straight from the 60's.  Where else can you eat a big homey meal for $5 including the tip?  Give it a try.  These are the type of businesses we should be supporting."}
{"text":"I usually order just the eggs benedict here (or in my case, the eggs florentine *vegetarian version - substitute meat w/ spinach*... I don't think that its advertised.. but just ask) ...  Their eggs florentine is mega Deliiiiicious , great hollandaise sauce especially...i appreciate the flavorness of it even more after having a really craptastic shitbag one at Wimpy's Diner.  I have tried their fruit waffle.. and it was mediocre though... 4 stars for their eggs florentine.  O btw , pretty decent portion.. you get 2 eggs florentine/benedict and a good hefty side load of 'home-fries' ."}
{"text":"there is literally NOTHING remarkable about this place...and that's what makes it so great. They don't try to do anything fancy, or special, or out of the ordinary.   It's just good food, good service, and excellent prices.   Always my go-to breakfast spot.  Try the Steve's Super--the potato pancakes are great."}
{"text":"Came in saturday during lunch time. Was pretty busy, took awhile to get seated, waited even longer once seated to be even given the menus or water. I get that it was fairly busy but it shouldn't take 5+ min to get a menu. Finally ordered the California eggs Benedict, it was decent, nothing great. Generally  a poor experience and lacking good service."}
{"text":"I visited 2 times in the morning, the breakfast is good. It has big portion and the price includes tea or coffee. Good Deal ( around $9)l!  The place is clean but not fancy. It is good for family.  I will visit it again."}
{"text":"Food is fine. Nothing special. Basic diner food. Slightly overpriced for what it is. Our entire experience was ruined though due to the service. Our server was extremely rude and short with my boyfriends daughter (this was unacceptable) and our food took forever and was cold because he forgot about it.  (I've been there before and other servers were fine.)"}
{"text":"Again, another good Greek Salad north of the city. Truth is, the ingredients are pretty bare minimum - iceberg lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, olives and feta cheese. What really makes this salad worth the trek to Bathurst and Wilson is the creamy salad dressing. The waiters have learned - just give the table their own bottle of salad dressing so you don't have to keep returning to the kitchen for more. If you're in the mood for Greek Salad for dinner, add a chicken skewer for some extra protein. It's open late so a good \"after baseball\" spot."}
{"text":"The food is good but they have been cheaping out on coffee. Back then you could buy a meal and they give you free coffee. I didn't mind that they charge more because things are getting more expensive. Recently only 2 refills per client. I've been a regular for 6 years and I'll have to take my business elsewhere. I spend $50 for 3 people for breakfast and an additional refill before i leave was denied. Taking my business to bagel world where the cups are bigger and no issue with refills. Not to mention how much can one drink?! Must for me is 3 small cups. Sad that the management tries to nickel a dime."}
{"text":"This location at bathurst and wilson is the first and best one. The other location we can disregard as the food was 2 stars less than this one. I only go there for brunch. I went there a few years back when I had my entertainment book coupons. It was the best thing ever and I have been going there since. My usual is smoked salmon benedict  which is affordable for about $10 and it comes with coffee or tea. And a berry smoothie which is about $4. The benedict is delish, go during breakfast hours and you wont be disappointed. The potatoes are so good and egg and hollandaise sauce are just right. The smoked salmon is a decent portion too. Its very filling. The smoothie soo good too the berry one is the best one. I always want to try to greek salad which looks so good but I just can't help but get my usual. i have tried benedicts from other places and it hasn't compared to steve's. I also tried it at le petit dejuner which was ok, the hollandaise sauce was lemony and fries were ok, it was pricey and not as good and filling as steve's. My boyfriend loves this place too his usual is grand slam or the benedict with a berry smoothie."}
{"text":"Steve's greek chicken salad is in my opinion the  best one in town mainly due to his homemade dressing, the freshness of the ingredients and the generous portion. I have also tried the hamburgers which are really made of fresh meat and are excellent. The decor could use some sprucing up to make it les looking  like an old fashion corner restaurant.   Definitely a good choice if you are looking for great food excellent service and don't feel like dressing up or pay a fortune for a good meal in a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Steve's is the neighborhood go-to for breakfast, and for me, it never disappoints.  There can certainly be a line on weekends around brunch time, but never an unreasonably long one. I find the service friendly and sweet.   Depending on the night before, my order varies, but I really love their sausage - they split and grill it for extra flavour, and I like to order mine well done. My friends and I have been known to order a \"side\" of grilled-cheese at Steve's.  Eggs are always perfectly cooked, and boyfriend loves his omelettes."}
{"text":"Great value, good food with  a divey feel. Great potato pancakes and gyro."}
{"text":"A very nice place to enjoy breakfast with friends.  Firstly, they have parking (its limited but they do have it) behind the restaurant.   Secondly, it is quite spacious and can accommodate a lot of people.   The menu is quite large and there is lots to choose from. These place is famous for eggs bene so I went with Eggs Bene with salmon. The eggs were done right and the salmon was not too salty as some of the other restaurants I had it at.   The service was quite fast and good. The food was brought to us in a timely fashion and was warm."}
{"text":"Wanted to find a brunch/breakfast place on the way to the airport and tried this place. The restaurant wasn't busy so we were seated right away  I got the grand slam breakfast (2 eggs, sausages, bacon, and a pancake). I personally like the American breakfast and this met my cravings. The portion for the price is similar to many other breakfast places  Only bad thing about this place was that we had to wait over 25 minutes to get our food AFTER we ordered.. it wasnt even busy so I'm not sure what happened."}
{"text":"Very good food, large menu, and bargain basement prices. Friendly, quick service at noon on a Saturday."}
{"text":"RIP, Steve's.  Its been a staple of this neighbourhood for longer than I can remember.  Sadly, it went downhill, numerous Dinesafe infractions, the service was poor (the servers would take your order but not much else).    Head up the street to Wimpy's at Bathurst and Sheppard - service is always good and the food is superior."}
{"text":"I've been to Steve's a number of times and I feel like I'm consistently just a little underwhelmed by.   I recently went for lunch with both my brother, and our dad. Just walking in, there's nothing particularly engaging or interesting about the restaurant itself, but admittedly, that's not a big deal. We sat down and were quickly greeted by a cheery waiter who politely took our orders.   The menu is fairly big and even though I heavily considered pancakes or a crepe, I ended up going for a simple meal: just two eggs over easy with hash browns and toast.  My dad and brother each ordered a different variation of omelette (they have quite a few options).   Our food came out relatively quickly, albeit without my brothers coffee, and looked pretty appealing. In all honesty, the eggs over easy were cooked PERFECTLY. The whites were solid but soft and the liquid gold yolk just oozed out when I cut into the eggs. On the other hand, I was definitely let down by the home fries. I thought their taste was lacklustre and the texture of most pieces was a bit too mushy for my liking. I wished they were cut smaller and cooked to have a more crisp exterior. The taters still tasted good, but certainly had room for improvement. Near the end of the meal our server must have remembered my brothers coffee and brought it over, but we were practically finished our plates at that point. Other than that, the service was fine.  I wish Yelp would let me give this restaurant a solid 2.5 stars. The eggs were great, but the rest of the dining experience was fairly generic and I was surprised how costly our bill came out to be (luckily pops picked up the cheque). I'd go back again as long as Dad is still buying! :P"}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood place. Friendly. Fast. Cheap. Tasty. Genuine. Good, hardworking staff. Easily gets 5 stars on my breakfast list. If you're real people, you'll love it. Country-clubbers, not the place for you."}
{"text":"Food is okay, inexpensive.    I had the biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs, 2 sausage, 2 bacon, all under 5 USD.  My daughter had the same, but with french toast.    She said the french toast tasted too much of egg.  Her hot chocolate was \"powdery\" and the whipped cream with it left a film in her mouth."}
{"text":"Tried it based on some strong Yelper reviews and it was just really bad. Terrible limp soggy corned beef hash, really weak anemic toasted western sandwich, and just nothing was anywhere near as good as it is served up at any of hundreds of little greasy spoon diners across the city. The kitchen clearly doesn't care any more than the whiny waiter did. I won't ever be back. .James."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast but it's great, inexpensive and close to home. Must try at least once!"}
{"text":"My reviews are written on a dollar for dollar basis.  If you charge hipster prices, you better make me feel like a princess, or ahem, a prince. Steve's is cheap, the food and service is very good.  It's not pretty, it's not amazing, but dollar for dollar, it's great.  Nice breakfast for a budget.  $3.09 on a Saturday for 2 bacon, 2 sausage, toast, hash browns and eggs.  Weekdays are practically free... $.99 for a full meal of food?  What year is this?  I feel like I took a DeLorean here with Marty McFly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty meh-tastic. The only reason why I've eaten here several times is because it's walking distance to my work.  I can't say much for the service because we usually get take out, but the take out area is right near the kitchen, meaning that you're in EVERYONE'S way.   The breakfast is pretty good, giant portions and exactly what you want. The wings are pretty good, too. The hot isn't very spicy, but the wings themselves are a good size. The fish and chips is disappointing, not very crispy with thick, bland fries.   In my opinion, nothing special, but it's sort of the only restaurant of its kind in the area."}
{"text":"Most affordable meal in town. Food always taste good and the service is always kind."}
{"text":"Steve's has been around since long before me. It's a landmark, and a great place to go for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I would really love if they put a bit of $$$ into up keeping the place a bit, the food is good but the washrooms are not pretty. It can get quite busy so I do not recommend you go during those times as the service can be weak and it can feel a bit cafeteria style. The Greek salad and dressing is my favourite around, and they are great for a hangover breakfast lol."}
{"text":"Great little spot! First time there and I ordered some delicious chicken salad which had red onion, cheese, bacon and honey mustard dressing. It was a large and filling salad. I could have definitely made something similar on my own but appreciate a good salad I don't have to prepare myself! My husband got the beef dip, again, very flavourful and a good portion size. Our server wasn't the most friendly and I felt the prices were slightly high for a diner style restaurant. The salad was around 15-16$. I would probably go back again and try one of their burgers or sandwiches."}
{"text":"Let's venture beyond Bloor street for a moment, shall we?... If you ever find yourself in the Bathurst and Wilson area, visit Steve's.   This family restaurant has a huge menu, good prices and decent food. It's nothing fancy, but the food is good and comforting. It's kind of like your own home-cooked meal but you felt like having someone else cook it and serve it to you.   I used to live in North York and I'd eat at Steve's every so often and it's nice to know that there are other options up there besides Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"I will admit that the food is a solid 3 stars- but the price brings it down to a 2 star.   Service a little on the slow side. Coffee was kind of weak and did not have the same effect as a cup of timmies. Needed 2 cups. That mixed with eggs in the morning caused for a little bit of uncomfortable situation on the way to work after. Gross!!.. I know. I did it to myself so no big deal. Its not the restaurants fault. You are not supposed to chug coffee because its nots waking you up and it being kind of cold. Well, maybe they have a role in it  My biggest qualm with this place is that my home fries were cold. I'm a big fan of home fries- and due to it being breakfast - I didn't have time to send back my order and get it re-heated. UGH.  The good news is . The eggs Benedict was done really really well. I was stuffed after!  or maybe that was the coffee. Not sure yet. I think I have a sugar rush!  where's a wash-room?"}
{"text":"This place SUCKED!  potatoes had no flavor at all! would rather have eaten potato flakes than those hash brown sausage pPatty's were gross links I think were turkey sausage not pork they were gross too, only good part the coffee and the service eggs sucked bacon sucked also"}
{"text":"It is like going to eat at grandma's.  Comfort food at a great price. So far everything we had there has been excellent. Staff is friendly and food comes out pretty quick. Expect a working man's restaurant,  no frills."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast ! Love the eggs Benedict. Probably the best in the city. Go early because this place is always packed. Service is pretty good. Coffee is good."}
{"text":"A colleague suggested we come here this morning.  I've never been but I'm always there when it comes to breakfast.  I got the Avocado omelet and it was delicious.  Pieces of avocado, big tomato chunks and pieces of bacon in the egg and I had no complaints with the taste.  The home fries weren't bad but nothing special.  I've been to some places and they always do something to their home fries that make it unique but this place didn't do any of that.  On top of that, you don't get much for the price you pay.  Not that quantity is everything, but again, taste was good but nothing special.  Anyway, the place was clean and the servers were very nice."}
{"text":"Great staff! Breakfast is simple and tastes homemade. The weekday 99c breakfast is a steal. You have to buy a beverage, but that's not too much more expensive.  You'll feel like a local in this great location. Can't say much about the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I am in town for business. Needed a simple but good breakfast place.  This is it.   The service is friendly and excellent. The omelette was perfect as was the coffee. Highly recommend.    And by home standards - Manhatten - this place is a bargain. I think my $6 breakfast would be 12-15 at home."}
{"text":"Great friendly place for an excellent value breakfast with every breakfast option you could want. The food was good and fast. The coffee was not the best but standard for a mom and pop place. It is exactly what you would expect for a neighborhood place."}
{"text":"This restaurant holds a special place in my heart because I spent my childhood years at Bathurst and Wilson, and back when I was a kid this restaurant was a simple \"truck stop\" located just south of where it currently is now. I actually remember the old restaurant and when I was really young (about 10) we would go there and take out their fries in cardboard containers.  Back then it was just a lunch counter, no tables. The food is consistently good, and the portions are amazing.  It is a simple restaurant, nothing fancy in terms of the building. Their french fries are out of this world and their breakfasts (I have had many) are unbelievably good. Parking is a problem as the restaurant sits on an angle, but you can usually find metered parking on the street, or park on Almont Road (just behind the restaurant) if there is room, or take your chances at the strip mall across the street. If you're going on a weekend and you think you want brunch...be prepared to wait.  This place is usually packed (but worth it). Cheers to a diner that reminds me of my childhood.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on Monday around 10:00 am.  I was told to sit anywhere I chose.  Within a minute I was greeted and asked if I knew what i'd like to drink and handed a menu. There were several folks having meals but not packed by all means.  Upon browsing the menu, I feared I had entered a time travel port through the front door of the restaurant.  Most breakfasts were somewhere below $5.  I ordered 3 over easy eggs and 3 strips of bacon which comes with toast and home fries for $3.99.  I added a side of sausage gravy for another $1.30.  The food came out in what seemed like less than 5 minutes.  The gravy was excellent with very good sausage flavor and not just a white sauce of flour flavor.  I'm picky about eggs.  The over easy eggs were done to perfection, runny yolks, no crusty over cooked brown bits on outside of eggs.  Bacon was not overdone, thin, limp.  If you want crispy bacon, maybe ask for that but I enjoyed mine as is.  Home fries were standard, some browned up nice.  Toast was standard as well.  I added a soft drink for $2.25 which was refilled promptly.  I was asked if I wanted anything else which Ideclined after this mountain of food for under $6.00.  After drink, my bill was just over $8.  I couldn't ask for much more for that price point.  I will return for breakfast."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a little all day breakfast. Despite the overall low review (3/5 stars), I found this place to be really good! Good food, good service and it was clean inside. Lots of selection on the menu.  I got the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon (sauce on the side) and my husband got the two sausages breakfast. The portions were good and I loved the potatoes. I also ordered a side of fruit for my baby and I loved how they had a whole bunch of different fruits inside.   Our server was friendly and brought up a high chair for the baby right away. The high chair was clean and had working straps.   Unfortunately, my baby was super cranky but no one gave us a hard time. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"Not a bad option if you're just looking for decent diner food for cheap.   The best thing about Steve's was the service the day we were there. The place was packed but the waitress was constantly at our table refilling our coffee and making sure we had everything we needed.   As for the atmosphere - its a dive diner in Cleveland. Nothing fancy here. Just a dining room full of people and the sound of plates banging around in the kitchen.  The food was ok. Nothing special, just your typical diner breakfast. You can't beat the price though. They have meals starting at $1. I had 3 eggs, 3 strips of Bacon, 3 sausage patties, homefries and toast for $4 something.   If you're looking for a decent meal and want to get in and out ASAP Steve's is a good option. They turn the tables quick here."}
{"text":"It was 3:30 pm Saturday as I searched for that all important first meal of the DAY.  Breakfast sounded great about now so I headed over to Steve's.  There's about 10 parking spots at the back of the restaurant but lots more from the strip plaza across.  I came in and was given a choice to seat anywhere, so I went for the benches.  The menu is standard DINER and All Day Breakfast but unlike Sunset Grill or Cora's, this place is still open after 4 pm.  Entrees, Seafood, Burgers, Salads, Sandwiches, Omelettes, Waffles, etc.  Back Bacon & Eggs(Best in Toronto!)($8.99) was pretty standard fare as it came with 2 Eggs rather than 3 however the Coffee or Tea was included in the price already which is GREAT for me.  Typical Diner service and there was Coffee Refill once the Diner Dash-looking girl was free to do so.  Their claim for BEST Back Bacon & Eggs, I'm not sure where it comes from but I don't have my input for that statement at this time.  They had a NEW menu posted that had Turkey Sausage and Egg that looked pretty good, I'll give it a try next time."}
{"text":"This is my first review ever and it sucks it has to be a bad one but i am appalled of the service and lack of urgency in this establishment. I come here quite regularly. In love with the avocado omelette. Me and my bf decided to come here specifically because they have a patio. We came in and no one was sitting outside so i asked a waiter if we can sit outside he said of course go right ahead. We went outside and most of the chairs had water on them so we found two that were perfect and set up the umbrellas because I'm a bartender so why not do it ourselves. Sat down and for about 10 minutes no one came to greet us. So i came in and notice a woman leaning on a partition in the back facing the patio. So i went up to the same waiter and asked if anyone is working the patio. He said yes sorry someone will be with you now. The woman i saw leaning was the one that came to us and said oh no one has greeted you? Well maybe she should pay attention since we had no menus no drinks on our table. We ordered 2 apple juices and 2 waters. The lady did not came back for another 5-10 minutes. I was beginning to lose my patience with this place. Then a old short grey haired balding man who's a great example of how a waiter should not conduct himself came out to ruin my morning. He asked us what we wanted. I said i already ordered. I don't know what is going on but know one seems to be bringing us anything or even caring that we are out here. He started saying well i don't know what happened with the other waitress and theres nothing i can do i have six tables and I'm doing everything myself. First and for most you never tell your customers how bad of a day your having. They do not care. Im there to get served and eat. Having six tables is not that big of a deal when you have a food runner and a busser. I do that on a slow night. However everyone is different. He was just getting annoyed by the second and wanted to leave us as quickly as he came. So i said id like 2 apple juices and 2 waters and may we order with you since i don't know where that woman is. He said well yes that what I'm here for. Thanks tips! I said i wanted the avocado omelette my boyfriend ordered the gran slam and as he was facing the door instead of having eye contact with your customers i said my omelette comes with coffee or tea right. He proceeds to waive his hands in a \"hurry up\" manner circling them in front of him basically to tell me to hurry up and yelled \"well yea tea or coffee which one is it\" i was appalled. I said tea and looked at my bf n said what is wrong with him? My bf was getting a little uneasy because he knows how i can get with unnecessarily rude people. My question is why is this man in this industry? If your complaining about having 6 tables and its too much for you get a job in an office. If you cant handle customers being upset because the one thing they need waiters to do is wait on them then don't be a waiter. What you should of done when i complained about no one takin care of us is not tell me about his problems. But apologize on behalf of his staff say i will get you whatever you need urgently and get on it. Not completely upset the patrons to the point where me and my bf got up and left to where someone wants our business. Is he not working on his tips? I left because after that i didn't know whether or not my food would be spit on or if i had anything else to say i surely didn't want to say it to this guy because his breaking point was when i asked him for tea. That man needs counseling and anger management classes and not be working in the service industry. Needless to say i will never be coming back there and everyone who is anyone will hear about my wonderful experience especially my friend, a toronto star critic. This needs to be published."}
{"text":"Nothing better in the area than this joint. Greek salad with chicken or usual bacon and eggs. Gotta have those fries crispy"}
{"text":"solid place to grab breakfast or lunch, and really inexpensive. I think breakfast for me and my cousin set us back about 15 dollars...total.  frequent refills of coffee, as I hoped and needed.  the biscuits and gravy (come on, how could I turn that down?) were really good, the home fries were good, the scrambled eggs were alright (a little overdone, but not bad).  pretty basic diner, but sometimes that's all you need."}
{"text":"This place was founded in 1946. I was told that a lot of movers and shakers go there for breakfast, but I have never been there early in the morning. It is certainly a fixture, and the staff knows how to run a restaurant.  This feels like a neighbourhood restaurant, with nice homey offerings, at a good price. The menu is extensive (eat your heart out Gordon Ramsey), and I had their Greek Salad a couple of times. It was fresh, plentiful, and tasty. They did however grate or shred their feta instead of serving it in chunks.  We shared a couple of sandwiches, which were fresh and tasty. What more can you ask from a local restaurant. It has been around this long because it does things right.  We certainly will return when we are in the area."}
{"text":"First of all, it's such a great, family atmosphere. It's an awesome place to go for breakfast! Their coffee and potato pancakes are amazing, and the servers are so sweet."}
{"text":"Quick bite in one of North Yorks oldest diners, however if you're coming here during rush hour, just keep in mind due to its location at Wilson and Bathurst, its a busy intersection. We dropped in here at around 5pm for a quick bite whilst this place was quiet.  Both of us ordered a second round of their special homemade potato skins (each order: 5 pcs)  It was a good size, packed with cheese, and lots of bacon!! definitely a perfect 5!! why else would i order a second one? lol....... after that we had their apple blossom dessert with ice cream which was A-OK!!  Ive been here numerous times, and this place is mainly a breakfast, brunch type-of-joint.   Its served this community because of its affordability, portions, service, and as a result it will always retain its clientele!  good job steve!"}
{"text":"Great little mom and pop diner. Breakfast was inexpensive and fantastic! I live in Orlando, and let me just say they NAILED the biscuits and gravy! Quick service, friendly staff, low prices.  THIS IS one of those homegrown unsung, must-hit spots if you're in the Cleveland area for breakfast."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and had to try it out!  Excellent food!  Exactly what we had hoped for in terms of breakfast!  All this and four of us are for under $30!  Super friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"We stopped here after mass. Great local spot for breakfast. Fast and friendly service - and local!! Not that I needed it but homemade sausage gravy was close to what I had growing up. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"This place is really popular with the locals and many of the reviews attest to that. I don't have any kind of connection to the place, so I just treated it as your average breakfast place.  We had a decent experience--not great, not bad. The food was fine, and the portions weren't as large as some of the other reviews might suggest. My poached eggs tasted of vinegar, which I know some don't appreciate, but I actually do as it shows the chef prepared the eggs from scratch. The bacon was really tasty. Otherwise, not much to note about the meal.  The place lost some points for me for the bathrooms. They were clean, don't get me wrong, but they smelled strongly of disinfectant, a smell that remained with me for a while after I left. The place had recently been renovated and painted and smelled strongly of fumes. Beyond that, the parking in the back is small and hard to navigate.  The staff gets high marks for friendliness and quickness of service, and the prices were fine."}
{"text":"If I could give this a 4 1/2, I would.  The only reason for not receiving a 5 star rating was the weak coffee.  My wife and I arrived around 11:30 for a late brunch and much to our surprise received a seat immediately after arrival.  The wait staff was rushed but still friendly and shortly after our arrival the line up was all the way out the front door.  The banana pancakes were superb.  My wife said they were the best she'd ever had.  I had the grand slam and have to say the bacon and sausage was cooked perfectly.  Crispy but not dried out.  The eggs were great as were the home fries.  It is definitely a family place, screaming kids and crying babies were in no short supply, but it just gave the restaurant an appropriate atmosphere as it is very much a family oriented business.  All in all, a great experience and we will definitely visit again soon."}
{"text":"Steve's serves up some of the best breakfast/brunch in Toronto. Maybe a couple extra bucks in comparison to other breakfast spots, but it is well worth the price. You don't stick around for 70+ years without doing something right. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"How on earth have I never reviewed this place? Our family visit almost daily!  Restaurant has a family atmosphere and has been a staple in the community for years! It has both booth and table seating. Menu has many family favourite, American staples. I will admit though, they don't update their menu often. The 'new items' advertised have been on the menu since...I thought I had written this review (in other words, years!)  Everything they do, they do well! Staff are attentive and prices are reasonable! I generally order ham and eggs when I'm dining at the restaurant and it's quite often more food than I can eat in one sitting (eggs, meat, potatoes, toast and coffee). I've never had a single complaint!  If I'm not dining at the restaurant: I generally have a green salad with a grilled chicken breast. Usually done very well with lots of fresh vegetables.  Only negative aspects to this restaurant is that parking is limited and the washrooms are down a big flight of stairs. However, in the area it is one of the few places that doesn't have a step to get into.  Undoubtably, we will continue to be customers for years to come."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years for breakfast when visiting Toronto. 5-star food with 2-star service which I will round to 4-stars overall. Bathrooms are filthy which doesn't bother me so much but because of this I can't really go with my wife or daughter. I always get the same back bacon and eggs and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"What a gem.  This is a great place. The food is excellent and they have many choices. While the decor is dated, the food is fresh and well prepared. Moreover  while there are many places with good food the staff takes this place to the next level. Everone is friendly and welcoming.  From your first time there you are family and you leave looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"First off, I really wanted to like this place... but unfortunately, despite being a pretty relaxed person in terms of taste, I just can't even see myself going back. First and foremost, our service was inconsistent and frankly, at times rude. Obviously the servers were overwhelmed with the Sunday rush, but all the same they just lacked simple courtesy.  That alone though isn't enough to turn me off a place: despite the fair pricing, the food was pretty unspectacular.. the pancakes were actually-- dare I say it-- bad. I didn't think that was even possible, but I've consistently made better fare at home. My husband's eggs benedict also not very palatable. \ All in all, we unfortunately won't go back. I will say though that for families, it's not a bad option: there's  a lot of food to be had for a reasonable price and as they're accustomed to a very bustling and at times noisy atmosphere, parents nervous about taking out there little ones will be relieved to see that no one will be giving them an awkward eye if their kids get a little noisy."}
{"text":"This simple little spot is one of the places I find myself returning to. It's not particularly fancy, has more of a casual Sunday brunch feel where you might bring a group of friends or family.  The menu has some decent variety, they have the usual breakfast/brunch fare along with some smoothies, wine, seafood, burgers, salads, and wraps. They even offer some more substantial dinners like roast beef, turkey, steak, and lasagna - but no one comes to Steve's for a fancy dinner. You come to Steve's when you want to go out without \"going out\". Or when you're a bit hungover and need breakfast. Or for a drop-by Greek salad - which, by the way, I found out about from another review. Their Greek salad dressing is really good, and it seems like they know this by now because when you order the greek salad they don't put the dressing on it, they just bring the whole bottle of dressing to your table.  So the food is good but a little pricey for what it is. Service is decent although a little on the slow side. But the bathrooms are another matter.  Every single time I've come to Steve's, the bathroom has been dirty and smelly. Which is a problem but not a complete dealbreaker. Until the most recent time I was here, when there was NO TOILET PAPER at all, nothing. And I had to go. Really badly.  So when I got downstairs to the smelly dirty bathroom and realized this, I got nervous. I ran upstairs and tried to find a server but they were busy and I didn't have time to explain and then wait for them to bring toilet paper. So I ran - no, sprinted - out of the restaurant (while my friends looked at me like I was crazy) and down the street looking for the closest bathroom which ended up being the Starbucks at the plaza. Overall, very embarrassing experience.  You'd think they could afford to do a bathroom reno - or at least keep it stocked with toilet paper.  Overall, food is good but pricey, try the greek salad with the dressing, service fine but a bit slow and BATHROOMS NEED IMPROVEMENT lol"}
{"text":"I LOVE Steve's. Between the delicious Greek-style breakfast options, the friendly wait staff and the dirt cheap prices, you really can't go wrong. Definitely a Mom and Pop spot frequented by locals, so if you're looking for a hipster spot with organic ingredients and Croque Madame, this place isn't for you. BUT if you're looking for a delicious local spot for some eggs and bacon at $5 a person, they have you covered! Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"My sister and I spent a month worth of weekends to find a great local diner near her new place. First stop: Steve's! Having nothing to compare it too at the time, I was in love. What the other reviews say are true, Big portions, cheap cost, friendly atmosphere, Everything was definitely edible. Ordered the Broadview Special, Steve's Super, and eggs benedict.   But did this place end up the favorite? Nope! They were beat out by Gabe's. Sorry! I do give major kudos for actually being competition. But elsewhere nearby the corned beef was homemade, the potato pancakes bigger & more herb-y flavorful, and the benedict sauce richer."}
{"text":"Extremely poor customer service. Rude wait staff. Inpatient and short tempered. Half the restaurant is always blocked off. It is supposed to close at 10pm tonight, we got here at 8:45 and the guy told us we have to order quickly and didn't even bring a menu. As we entered he locked the door behind us. I ordered my food as he ran by and 5 minutes later he runs by and tells me I have to have fries because what I want is out. He didn't give me an option and just ran away. I'm leaving no tip and will NEVER be coming back."}
{"text":"Great family friendly local diner! Good breakfast and lunch menu. The food selection and service is fantastic! The omelets are on point. Very flexible with their menu and will accommodate you for your order!   Coffee is of course super important for breakfast and that is a highlight here too! Great place for breakfast and lunch!   Basically it's good food at a great price, nothing fancy here, but exactly what you would expect from a local diner!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. We were visiting Cleveland for the weekend and looked up diners to eat breakfast on Yelp. We found this diner and they don't disappoint.  You have to love a place that knows it's regulars, makes new people feel at home and takes the time to talk to the kids all while dishing up great food.  The food is comfort food that is hot and good. The prices are amazingly low. They set up soup kettles and you serve yourself!! Homemade chicken noodle and beef rose marina were the soups today and they looked great.  We ordered breakfast and we were so full by the end.  The coffee never stops coming.  The staff are friendly and know their business. There is nothing they do wrong here. I encourage anyone who wants a great meal at reasonable prices with a friendly smile to check this place out."}
{"text":"I was here with my Boyfriend we came for lunch at about 12 pm. He ordered fish & chips and I ordered a sandwich  His came out first. I thought mine would be out shortly after. He was finishing his food when new people came and sat down beside us, they ordered. I still had not recieved my sandwich. I then asked the waitress how much longer I should expect to wait. She said she would check. A few minutes passed and I saw her return with our neighbors food. I asked for my food to go. When I finally got it it was mediocre at best. Never again!"}
{"text":"Finally I had a gyro there !   It's been years since I've had a gyro, so I cannot compare it with others. However, The gyro was tasty and consisted of the greek sauce, flat pita bread, freshly cut raw onions, and meat [quite a bit of it, could barely stay in the pita]; with a side of french fries, and all-you-can-eat-soup for $4 - great value.   Even though there wasn't a crowd, the service was a bit slower than I had expected."}
{"text":"I dropped by around 1:00 on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was packed, with the front entrance filled with people waiting for a table. Still, it only took about 10 minutes for my party of 2 to be seated.  The chicken caesar salad and crispy chicken wrap were good, if nothing special. Fries were boring but edible. The mozzarella sticks were excellent, if somewhat pricey (5 sticks for $6). The milkshake wasn't the thick, creamy variety that I was hoping for, but it was fresh and fairly tasty.  The service was unfortunate. Our table had no condiments, and our waitress advised us to share from the table next to us. I overheard our waitress approach the next table (who had summoned her after she disappeared) being very abrupt and unprofessional when she arrived, although I don't remember exactly what she said. Our appetizer and entrées came at the same time, and we didn't see our waitress again until we asked for the bill. And speaking of which, we waited for 20 minutes after we were finished our meal before our waitress re-appeared. Hopefully this service isn't representative of the other wait staff."}
{"text":"This place has been around as long as I can remember.  It moved about 20 years and they expanded their menu.  I had a greek salad and it was pretty good.  I honestly didn't expect the salad to be as fresh and tasty as it was."}
{"text":"This is an alsome mom and pop shop like no other. From the great customer service to the alsome food to even the unbelievable prices you won't be disappointed. Me and my wife like to try different small businesses and this one is a must return. Food service was super fast and extremely forfilling. Our meal was cook perfectly and was just as we asked of it. There's nothing bad to say about this shop other than it is a must go to place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Good food at a nice place. It's an older diner, breakfast all day kind of place. The burger was fantastic, the fries are frozen, not fresh, and the burger comes with soup as well. The soup is not homemade, but it was good. Overall it was a very good lunch. Great service, and it is inexpensive. The coffee was excellent as well. I'd go back any day, it was enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food is more or less OK.  The avocado omelette was not too bad.  The beef hash was OK, but unremarkable.  The Crepe with banana and Nutella was pretty sad looking.  They did not even bother spreading the Nutella inside/outside the crepe, but simply splattered it on top.  It looked like a Jackson Pollock, which I don't care for.  I never thought I could be critical of anything made with Nutella, but this dish proved otherwise.  It's not the food that's the downfall of this place - it's the atmosphere.  The place is pretty bleak.  One third of the restaurant looks permanently closed off.  The servers give you a sour face with every request.  The restrooms are not very clean, and plain uninviting.  The place is simply not well kept."}
{"text":"My ULTIMATE FAVOURITE Breakfast Restaurant!!! I used to go to the Thornbury Location and became a Fan. Best Eggs Bennedict in Town, I wish they would open a Location in Oakville. Always Friendly Service, clean facility and Great Food!!!"}
{"text":"It was decent.. id come here again for breakfast. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was sort of bland, yet light and creamy.. I normally don't put salt and pepper on eggs and benny.. but I had to do it this time but I enjoyed it, either way. The customer service was decent and attentive but not over the top. Reason for 3 stars is because it didnt wow me but I sort of recommend this place if your looking for simple breakfast"}
{"text":"Had a fairly decent meal had eggs Benedict and my girlfriend had bacon and cheese burger. The burger was decent the eggs Benedict was great."}
{"text":"My lady had a delicious, and huge breakfast (which she couldn't finish) and I had a delicious and satisfying California Burger plate (the cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast) which we ordered at 8:30, and were served by 8:42. We loved the food, the service was good, and I'm giving up the 5 star review despite the fact that the biff was whiff, and that we had to hurry, because the kitchen was about to close. It's seems Google offered up bad intelligence, in that we thought that the place would be open until 10. The very kind waitress explained that, Monday 'til Wednesday the spot would be open until 9 only. Thursday - Saturday, they're open 'til 10. Fairly reasonably priced too; $40, including the tip. I think we're gonna be back..."}
{"text":"This has been my favourite place since I was a kid. Their greek salad is the best I've ever had. The service is amazing and everyone is so friendly. Such a great place to have a reasonable and delicious meal with the family!"}
{"text":"There are some places that don't look the greatest from a decor perspective.  But if they cook great food and the people are nice then that's all I really care about when I'm grabbing lunch.  Came for lunch and had some breakfast. Got the Broadview: eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy. Everything was great. Service was friendly, fast, and fabulous.  Biscuits, fresh gravy and sausage was also made fresh and not too salty. The price was right also at under $10 with tip.  check this place out if you are in the Old Brooklyn area of Cleveland."}
