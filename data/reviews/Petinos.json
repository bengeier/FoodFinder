{"text":"Giant portions with great service! Don't forget to ask for their Petinos-style homefries that come with cheesey & hollandaise goodness."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this place. It was kind of overhyped. We were pleasantly surprised. We all took the \"Montérégie\", which consists of 2 eggs, choice of sausage, bacon or ham, fries, baked beans and a pancake. I highly suggest changing the pancake for the waffle. I chose the one with bananas, Nutella, English cream. This waffle was unbelievable! Definitely a very good breakfast place! The service, food and interior decoration were all very good. Only thing, a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast joint, Gaston and his crew are back. Service is exceptional and food is very good. Love the coffee thermos that they have for each table.  This place is clean and fresh. Same location as Chez Cora, but the food is better. Go and you be the judge."}
{"text":"We were at Petinos this morning for breakfast for the 2nd time since we returned from Florida in April.  We used to love this restaurant when it opened and always went there and recommended it to our friends and family.  What a change, it used to be awesome, not now, service awful, the restaurant is dirty, the bathrooms are smelly, guck on the floor and the food always comes cold and if you order breakfast the toast comes when you are 1/4 way finished and when you ask for your toast very well done, it comes hardly toasted at all.  We decided this morning never again, waste of money and fortunately there are other very good breakfast places on the West island.  Too bad, very upsetting because it used to be our favourite place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Good service... But personality wise a little snob'ishhh.
Food is always AAA.
Great place to go with friends n family."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I am a breakfast person.  I also love hip places with ambiance.  I was so  VERY lucky to find Petinos! 

Not only an amazing array of yummy breakfast choices that make it hard to choose just one, it's in this super chic little place that makes you want to stay till lunch!  I search high and low for great spots, especially when I travel for work so I was delighted when I found Petinos on a recent trip to Montreal.  Oohhh how I am still dreaming of my Nutella, banana and strawberry crepe...so moist with some much chocolaty goodness I had a hard time not asking for another one to go for my flight! My friends were nice enough to let me try their breakfast potatoes which were equally as delectable.  Overall the staff was so sweet and attentive, I'm looking forward to my next trip to Montreal and finding my way back to Petinos."}
{"text":"Get the steak breakfast --- and split it between two of you. Perfectly cooked and well priced considering the sheer quantity of food."}
{"text":"Busy place why? Because they do it right. I've been here several times & I will keep coming back. Their breakfast is real good - large portions, good service, reasonable prices, yummy & on the west island. What more do you want!?"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy the food. Had a few pieces of fruit on my plate which were visibly old and brown. It was not a pleasant breakfast."}
{"text":"There is always a huge line there, could be more than an hour wait on Weekends, I can't stand the girl at the front desk but the food... The food is delicious !
Do try their Oreo waffle it's seriously divine, the little potatoes/home fries are amazing, generous portion, big plate, everything is just so good! Try it!"}
{"text":"Delicious! loved their breakfast! 

I love what they did to the place- Its classier and there are no chickens on the wall :)"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Huge menu which is pretty ridiculous. The menu is like a novel. My husband was disappointed with his apple cheddar crepe. Filled with canned apples instead of fresh grated apples. Won't be going back there. We'll stick to our other favorites."}
{"text":"Mon restaurant de déjeuner préféré. Un peu dispendieux mais la cuisson des ufs est parfaite, les patates sont délicieuses, le café est excellent et le personnel est très serviable."}
{"text":"Not at all like the other petinos...the menu is not even the same!!!! Wat a waste of time and a drive!!!"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast! They have a huge selection. Be prepared to wait (15-20 minutes) before you get seated, as this place gets packed! Always busy but you can expect service to be quick. 
Huge portions! I get so full from eating here, that I don't eat anything the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Super Clean with excellent food in a chic environment!
The staff is overly attentive with focus on great food
VERY happy to find this new Gem in Laval...plenty of parking as they share the lot with IGA.
Thank-you Petinos."}
{"text":"In short, avoid this place because the hostess is the worst in the industry... Seriously. 

I waited 45 minutes to finally walk out because of the hostess's unprofessionalism. From all my life in going to multiple restaurants, i have never seen anything like that.  I gently requested a booth next to the table she initially assigned us, however,  she said no its for someone who asked for it before us. I then requested for another one and then she says its for a group of 5 and not 4.  I insisted on having the booth with 5 seats and then she started yelling at me (litterally yelling) for giving her trouble all the time (everytime i go to this place, i end up arguing with her for some reason).  I was humiliated in front of my friends and was put in an uncomfortable situation. The food is great, and its unfortunate to ruin a reputation because of an unpleasant behaviour."}
{"text":"First time coming here and it wont be the last. Best breakfast restaurant I have eaten in. The waffle was to die for, strawberries covered in english cream and nutella what is there not to like? Bacon cooked as requested and everything else on the plate was delicious. In my opinion, the prices were very good. And the service was so warm and welcoming even though the place was packed. We never felt rushed and we were never forgotten. A must try"}
{"text":"Been here for brunch twice, and it's alright. The place is closeby so the location is good as there is also a parking lot. The portion size is ok for the price and a lot of people in the area come here so it can be quite busy during the usual brunch times on the weekend. Place is pretty new so it is also still clean and bright, the staff seem friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great breakfast really enjoyed the waffle with strawberries, English cream and nutella are amazing! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you leave here hungry, clearly you're doing it wrong.  The combination plate at $14.95 was a great deal. Two eggs, a breakfast meat, a cup of baked beans, a waffle loaded with a variety of toppings or pancake (the chocolate chip pancake looked great!) and toast!

I would have liked for the restaurant to have their menu on the website.  As a first time guest, the choices in their phone book sized menu can be overwhelming.  It would have been nice to scope out the choices ahead of time. 

Do be prepared for a wait. The dining area is fairly small and jammed to the gills (word of good food apparently gets around). We had a larger party of five and at about 1:10pm we waited 45 minutes for a table.  Their policy, which I have no objection to, is to not seat parties unless every member is present. It might be a good idea to ask for a menu when you put your name on the wait list.

Waiters were pleasant and efficient, portions are generous and tasty.  The end result is well worth the wait. Great experience."}
{"text":"Went a weekday morning. Service was good. Food was good as well but they overcooked the steak. Everything else was great"}
{"text":"Laval has many great breakfast places to choose from with many people flocking to their usual spot Petinos was definitely worth checking out. There portion sizes are huge and will definitely leave you full. I'm a sucker for eggs benny and often get let down by egg whites that are under cooked but these ones were perfectly cooked and the hollandaise sauce was fantastic definitely worth trying something new and eating over here !"}
{"text":"Amazing Breakfast. This place is always packed. But they have so many staff the wait time is very little. They have an amazing menu to choose from and it will not leave anyone out ! 

I'm vegan and managed to find some menu items for myself. The waffles are amazing and come with free coffee or tea. If you don't want a full meal they have slot of great sides that you can choose from as well. 

We also ordered the crepe stuffed with bacon and eggs. This was a huge plate for $15 and came with potatoes and fresh fruit ! They have great free parking and accept all forms of payment. The food is quick out to the table and the servers always come by to fill up the water and check on you too."}
{"text":"I have been to many breakfast restaurants and this is the best by far.

I was going to turn around because the lineup at the door was pretty big but man am I glad I didn't. We got a place pretty fast and even if the place was packed the service was amazing. From the hostess to the waiters everyone was on point. The lady at the door even remembered my boyfriend's name and said bye by his name when we left.

The menu is huge and got at least 200 choices but I was craving waffles so I didn't spend too much time and the rest of the menu.

I took the house special waffle and it was out of this world. Very big and tasty waffle, loads of apples, creme anglaise and caramel.

I will be going back to try a few more items on the menu.

Great food, amazing staff and awesome atmosphere but if you are going there to have a quiet breakfast think again because it is busy and pretty noisy."}
{"text":"It is your generic brunch place laid out much like a Cora and also very much in demand as it had a long line.

Service: service was great, we were seated and had warm coffee without any undue wait time. The girl serving us did a good job and we never felt as if we were just waiting to be served. So nothing spectacular but service you would expect.

Food: I had a Benedict and my girlfriend had pancakes, and while the food is good it is also served up in quantity so you are definitely getting your money's worth!

Overall: it was a good brunch experience, doesn't have the cool atmosphere of old Montreal, or any really special signature dishes or coffees to write home about, but it does a good job as a west island brunch place to go to on a lazy Sunday morning!"}
{"text":"A new location and has been open less than a month ago. I have to rate it again, as it was over crowded and service was very poor. I would give it another chance just because it recently opened, however the food was very average and there was a big lineup. 

We have ordered a few different dishes as we went there with our friends, and in general we thought the the fries was good overall but as for the eggs and other dishes they were ok. 
Never Never EVER order the tuna sandwich, it felt like they didn't have time to make it, so they just opened a can of cheap Tuna (in Water), and just put it in the sandwich! No seasoning no dressing not even a slice of tomato!!! Nothing at all!!

It is a nice clean place and good for families with kids, however there are no crayons or anything special for kids. 

A useful note: pay attention to your bill... there were few mistakes."}
{"text":"Magique. C'est le meilleur resto déjeuner que j'ai essayé jusqu'à date. Je salive encore en pensant à la gauffre à la crème anglaise et pomme et cannelle que j'avais commandée et que je n'ai malheureusement pas pu terminer tellement elle était grosse. Le service était tout aussi excellent."}
{"text":"Excellent!! My Californian dish was the best!! And the Monteregie selection with banana and Nutella grauffe!! 
I love the customer service , the reception 5* !!"}
{"text":"Portions généreuses, bon goût et service impeccable! Dois-je en rajouter?
Les crêpes sucrées sont délicieuses!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Their waffles and home fries were amazing. We were a party of 8 and all of us loved their food. Their portions are huge! One of us ordered just a cream cheese and bagel - but even that was a huge portion size. 

Just a tip: their beans are not vegetarian."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's always like this but me and my friends went here for the first time and we got plates with waffles that are served with fruits and English creme . Something was really off with the English creme . It had a odd taste. And after we finished our waffles we all felt sick . About an hour later we got home and felt very very sick , me and one of my friends threw up . I wouldn't recommend or go back"}
{"text":"Have been going here for months and the results are always consistent. Great food, great service and a decent price. Have been meaning to take a picture of my plate, but every time that darn plate is laid out in front of me, the excitement takes over and my photo op goes out the window. Try their waffles with strawberry, Nutella and English cream, then you'll understand why I can never get that elusive picture! They are also very family friendly, the staff is accommodating and pay special attention to making sure my 10 month old gets plenty of smiles during our meal as well as being extra careful with his peanut allergy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Everything about it. You have to go to this place if you're in Montreal. Skip poutine and smoked meat and come here."}
{"text":"The first thing I have to say about this place is that the service is amazing. The staff is friendly and there are a lot of employees around. They also speak English,  french and I heard some Greek. 

The decor is modern and it made me think a bit of Allo mon coco, without the music. There's a lot of young families going to this location so the TV are showing a kids cartoons which makes sense.

For the food. My girlfriend had some eggs with a smoked sausage. First thing is forget the eggs which are standard. What made this plate shine was the smoked sausage. The taste was simply incredible. I took a plate called Le Versant (some of their plates are named after golf courses which was ironic since I was coming back from a golf game). The food was good but ordinary. There was nothing differentiating it from the other breakfast places, which is why it's getting 4 stars and not 5."}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. Always busy so be prepared if your group is larger than 2. Favourite breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly service, food arrived quickly.
The coffee tasted watered down, but I'm sure you can ask them to pour you a cup from a new brew.  

Heard many clients around me asking their waitress to make their order quick because their car is at the car wash.  Apparently, there is a car wash just next door - so, while waiting for your car to get washed, why not grab a quick breakfast?  Great idea! 

I ordered a spinach omelet - it tasted bland and dry.  The potatoes had the same texture and consistency of La Belle Province French Fries, with onions,  which were my favourite part of the meal.  The bananas served in my bowl of fruits were fresh.  

The only other comment is that I thought the utensils were the cleanest at any restaurant I have been to! Lol - it was freakishly really shiny!

A good place where the servers are pleasant and if you need a quick bite.  I have yet to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"L'un des meilleurs restaurants pour déjeuner du coin. Ils ont une grande variété de plats et leur crème chantilly est la meilleure. Très bon service aussi! 
Follow @sweet.n.salty for more"}
{"text":"\"Merci beaucoup from the Americans.\" That's what we wrote on our receipt...We went here for breakfast during vacation and the staff was very welcoming and friendly. Our waiter went along with teaching us a bit of French from the menu!  Food portions were decently large. My breakfast included a half waffle with Nutella chocolate, bananas, strawberries, and English cream-- it was delicious."}
{"text":"Most breakfast joints enjoy comparable fare. I mean eggs over easy are the SAME EVERYWHERE. Petinos' aren't any better. Although their home fries are dressed with some sort of spiced rub and chopped onions. Delicious. The waiter exercised a genuine likable personality and the place has a wealth of parking space. What's not to like."}
{"text":"Very very very very good breakfast. Huge quantities. Freshly squeezed OJ made my day. Decor is very nice. Will definitely eat there again. Pricing is fair."}
{"text":"Très bon resto de déjeuner je vais juste là maintenant , par contre il devrait faire leurs restaurant plus grand vue le nombre de client ."}
{"text":"Ohhh petinos where do I even start! Besides their humble staff members and beautiful hostess their food is absolutely the best brunch food. I usually order the Very berry half waffle, with poached eggs, sausages and petino's potatoes. the waffle is so fluffy on the inside smothered with berries , English cream and Nutella. Usually after a big brunch I feel so poopy and all I want to do is sleep but this waffle does my make your stomach stink. Sausages are thick and flavourful! I hate little breakfast sausages so I appreciate the thickness of the sausage when you bite into it. 

Now the petinos potatoes. Oh my gosh. Home fries with hollandaise sauce and cheese. The hollandaise is so light and so delicious. I always end up kicking the plate ! Overall, I loveeeeeeee petinos! I always bring my friends from out of town here and they've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Big portions and delicious brunch food. Every imaginable brunch dish is served on almost every dish. A bit of a lineup in the weekend but totally worth the wait. The service is amazing and the servers are very helpful."}
{"text":"Yummy! Loved my brunch for lunch that I tried last week - and apparently, this isn't the best Petino's!

Came here during my lunch break last week to catch up with friend's and big mistake, I was in a food coma when I got back to work lol

The portions are large and the prices are fair. I had breakfast for lunch, with a regular coffee and a florentine eggs benedict. I loved it. The sauce was lighter in colour and taste than other hollandaise sauces. I also liked that they served the fruits in a cup so as not to mix in with the eggs.

The potatoes were yummy but I think they could have been fresher. Will be going back the next time I'm craving breakfast for lunch in the area!"}
{"text":"Not an allergy friendly restaurant and extremely poor hospitality.  I called in advance to explain the numerous severe allergies of my child and asked if I could bring his own food but they informed me that I could not and that they could always find something for him to eat.  After arriving and explaining the allergies to the waiter, I was told that they could not guarantee anything (even the fruit) and it would be safer not to order anything for my child.  Very unprofessional way of handling allergies and I will definitely not be returning (the only reason I went and took my child in the first place was because we were a large group of people going for an occasion)."}
{"text":"Breakfast type of restaurant.

The good: Food is terrific! Service is usually quite good. Place has a nice clean vintage cozy look. Good portions.

The bad: Very busy and popular, up to the point that people wait in line in the restaurant. Servers \"finish their day\" and count their money on a corner table in the restaurant, in front of everyone (somehow that bothered me). The boss is just that, a boss, with the employees. Can be loud and noisy. Might take a while before you receive your food.

Go for the food, not for the noise and how the bosses treat the employees."}
{"text":"Number one breakfast place in Laval. Better quality better service then all the others."}
{"text":"Now I'm no restaurant expert in Terrebonne, but as local breakfast places go, this one is hard to match! 

Large menu, friendly staff, convenient location, fast service, and friendly owners who are always around."}
{"text":"We visited Petinos during the long-weekend for the first time. From our research, we only found 3 locations of the brunch spot and chose to visit the Laval branch due to the great reviews. It was there that we discovered that they recently opened in the South Shore but ah well, it was worth the drive!

We arrived around 12ish which is usually when the crowds are clearing at breakfast places but there was still quite a line up. It was a Saturday and long weekend, so it was expected I guess. We waited approximately 15-20minutes and were given a super warm welcome by the lady taking the names... It was a pleasure to meet her, she was friendly and full of life! Despite being very busy, they really have excellent service and attention. For the service alone, I would definitely return. Our waiter understood our special meal requests without us even having to explain and immediately knew how to amend our orders to suit us! Very impressive!

My husband and I both ordered from the Monteregie section (it was super difficult to nail it down to one selection as the menu is never ending! We both wanted eggs, potatoes and waffles so it was the perfect combination for us! Every single thing on the plate was mouth-watering and delicious. I would happily go back just to devour a whole plate of home-style potatoes - they were perfect! I found it difficult to finish my plate as even half a waffle is huge - I had the waffle with oreos and Nutella! I was in heaven  This kept me full all day!

Overall, extremely impressed by the quality of the food, the impeccable service and hospitality and the coffee/tea refills throughout! They really know how to spoil their clients. 
Petinos has easily become my favourite breakfast/brunch spot and I cannot wait to try the South-Shore branch to see if it does Laval justice"}
{"text":"Another brunch place! Same story as last time (refer to my review of L'Avenue). Ending a long night shift, I was on the hunt of a good brunch. My friends had already planned to go here so I joined them. We called for a reservation for 10 people and were able to get one for 9am, right before the rush. Around 11am, the place was packed. 

As for the food, I ordered from the Monteregie menu, which includes a half-waffle with toppings of your choice, 2 eggs, potatoes and a choice of meat. Being super hungry, I opted for all the extras possible, so i went for the extra benedict sauce on the potatoes and took all the meats. Needless to say, my portion was enormous. While the first half was enjoyable, the rest of it became a chore (my fault though). Food quality is decent and their waffle is very good even though that was the last thing I ate. 

Service was also very good, with constant refills of coffee. I would come back with a reasonable appetite. Also bonus points for parking spots!"}
{"text":"Petinos means rooster in Greek and that's a good thing since you'll certainly need one if you plan to wake up during the weekends to get to Petinos early enough to avoid the much warranted line-ups outside this breakfast joint. This place is busy... real busy.... and for good reason!

Their website vaguely boasts a variety of 250 choices to choose from and when you'll get around to the menu.... you can see why! They have something for everyone and you can mix it up to get what YOU want.

I went with the \"Le Petinos\" a huge breakfast plate with a variety of meats and eggs. I won't necessarily break it down how everything tasted but overall it was simply exceptional with no disappointments. I particularly loved their home-style potatoes that were simply out of this world good. The other patrons at my table all enjoyed their meals with very well presented grub even though they had a lot of clients at the door. They truly ensure to make sure you don't feel rushed when you're dining there. Did I mention to potatoes? Yeahhhhhh.... but everything else was on spot too... but them taters..... *drool*

The service was really good as well despite how busy it was. It was attentive with plenty of coffee refills. She brought crayons for my daughter. She played with her. Very sweet. The food arrived in a timely fashion (child first! awesome ) along with every needed check-up as we ate away. It was impressive.

Will be back."}

It was impressive.

Laval has some real stiff breakfast competition and Petinos is one of the best place you can choose your most important meal of the day. Heard this place from word of mouth... usually this type of hype doesn't meet expectations... I was glad it did.

Will be back... again and again."}
{"text":"Good food, large portions, huge selection, some GF options, service was up to par.  Coffee could be better, decor is very plain. There is a Starbucks next door for the coffee snubs like my wife. I would return for sure!"}
{"text":"There was this one time where I had breakfast at Petinos three times and four days.

Friendly and cheerful staff, this place is always full and the staff always manages to keep their smile.

Furthermore, the food is great and even better, their serving sizes are very generous.

I'm a local, so I come here quite often. If you are as well or just passing by, definitely take the opportunity to have breakfast here.

You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in the West Island. Large portions, great service, and friendly staff. The place is always completely full, so my wife and I usually go early to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"Quick and efficient service. Food is as expected however, breakfast sausages should be grilled on your grill top not deep fried. Serving below average coffee for a breakfast joint is a shame. Overall worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's a cool place for a big breakfast, the waiters are well informed and can make a recommendation if you are lost as I was. 

However a bit pricy for a couple and might be suitable for a big group who like to share and save."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! However, they messed up our reservation and made us wait 10 to 15 minutes for our table. The lady at the front did not even apologize for this which I found annoying. The place was super packed and the lines are long. So, guys..reserve beforehand and confirm your times :D Get the waffles!
Customer service could have been better!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOD this is the best breakfast i have ever had, and i eat a lot! The owners are incredible, friendly and fast. I dont even know where to start, everything was just perfect. This would be the only reason i would ever move to Montreal/Laval.
I love this place
I had 2 eggs over easy with 2 juicy sausages 2 chocolate chip pancakes and potatoes with cheese and holinadaise creme with a fresh squeezed orange juice with rye toast with a side of beans, you won't get it, it's a Quebecois thing 
Wife had 2 eggs over easy with a side of feta and with potatoes and bacon with a Belgian waffle with assorted berries and fresh creme and nutella side of beans and white toast
Son has the Belgian waffle with bananas and nutella
Great great great great, did i mention this place is GREAT"}
{"text":"We came here semi regularly since it's walking distance from home.   Today however was disappointing.  One strawberry on one plate was dirty, really dirty.  Told our waitress, she walked away with it and no feedback.  We now doubt the cleanliness of all the fruit.

We will not be back anytime soon.  At least when the bill came the plate which had the dirty strawberry was %50 off.  Thanks for that."}
{"text":"Les plats sont énormes et délicieux. Venez donc le ventre vide mais soyez prêts à attendre car l'endroit est très populaire surtout la fin de semaine.

Le menu est gigantesque! Petinos est un maître du déjeuner mais vous pouvez également dîner. Nous avons commandé deux plats similaires de la section Montérégie qui est la section des gaufres, la spécialité de la place. 

J'ai opté pour la moitié gaufre aux fruits avec de la crème anglaise, avec patates, oeufs et viande.  Les patates sont bien épicés et croustillantes, les oeufs bien faits et le bacon croustillant. La reine du plat est définitivement la gaufre, qui est énorme malgré la demi portion. Je l'ai adoré car la crème était succulente et j'étais très surprise de la variété de fruits qui accompagnés la gaufre: pommes, mûres, fraises, bleuets, framboises et melon miel.   

Vous avez le choix de vous assoir sur la terrasse ou à l'intérieur. L'espace est super chargé pour pouvoir accommoder le plus de gens possible donc vous pourriez vous sentir à l'étroit un peu.

Un coup de coeur sur ma liste de déjeuner!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!! My friends and i were amazed by how nice and attentive our server was. I think he was the owner of the place. 

Their plates are big and will fill you up for the rest of the day!

Prices are fine, pretty much like any other breakfast restaurant.

If you go there on the weekend, you will probably have to wait in line to get a table, but it wasn't so long before we got ours. 

I will definetly go back and i totally recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Pleasant decor, friendly service, but disappointing food. 
Dry overcooked spinach omelet made with frozen spinach, not fresh. Side of fresh fruit was tasty and fresh-cut, but garnished with blueberry syrup; not a touch that you'd want if you seek a healthy meal."}
{"text":"Amazing service and staff! I've met with 2 of the three owners (Maria and Jerry, Siblings) and I feel at home every time! They treat their customers like family! And don't even get me started on the food here, it's absolutely delicious and their servings are HUGE! 
IF YOURE IN THE AREA, YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE !"}
{"text":"J'adore. Le menu est très varié et plusieurs plats sont composés d'un peu de tout, ce qui rend le choix facile. Tout est très bon. Le restaurant est toujours très rempli. Vous attendrez aux heures de brunchs la fin de semaine. Le service est rapide et cordiale. Un des meilleurs pour le déjeuner à Laval."}
{"text":"Brunch in Montreal is a whole new ball park. I typically stay away from Brunch spots in Toronto, simply because I believe they charge ridiculous prices for items you could probably make just as good at home. BUT, in Montreal you have to eat brunch. These restaurants are packed on the weekends, as expected given the quality of the food they serve. 

Whenever I get the chance to go to Petinos I always order one of the montegeries. This is simply a breakfast plate that comes with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, a load of house potatoes, your choice of protein, baked beans & your choice of half a waffle. ALL OF THIS FOR AROUND $15.00!! I've heard everything else on the menu is good, which I whole heartedly believe but I can't let go of this dish. 

Now the house potatoes come in abundance of not only portions but flavour. Wow, I don't know how they can get them so crisp & flavourful. The baked beans are amazing. The eggs you choose how you want them & go well with the wonderful, buttery, soft pieces of toast they give you. There are also a variety of spreads for the toast, from caramel to jams to maple syrup. And just when you think you've had too many carbs, take a bite of your protein. 

Now I think the winner of the dish, is the waffles. Not only do you get a filling meal but you get to top it off with a Belgian waffle. They are so fluffy & good, it is crazy. The English cream isn't too sweet & so smooth. So so so good. 

The price is amazing, the food is amazing & the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Coup d'il d'arrivée invitant.  Propreté des lieux avec décors intéressant. Service rapide tant pour une obtenir une table que pour la commande. 

Des policiers sont  mes voisins.  Des habitués ! Ça doit être bon . C'est le cas.  Pommes de terre délicieuses et en grande quantité avec un bacon croustillant. Fruits frais.  ufs, pain brun, + un café qui a du goût. 

Vaut la peine de quitter la 15 pour y déjeuner à 5,95 $.  Il y a maintenant à 8h20 une petite file d'attente.

{"text":"Vraiment bien!!! Everything we had was delicious. Service was excellent. Didn't understand the breakfast baked beans lol!! But oh my. If we're here again we will return!!"}
{"text":"Petinos is me and my friends favourite place to have brunch! The staff are always great and the service is pretty quick once you're sat down.

Their breakfast food is by far one of the best in Montreal, comparing to other chains like Tutti Frutti, Allo mon coco and Chez Cora. I recommend the Montérégie half waffle with strawberries, English cream and Nutella served with eggs, bacon and potatoes on the side. It also comes with toast and coffee. Their hollandaise sauce is delicious and you can also top it off on your potatoes! The portions are also very generous, so take it easy when ordering. The prices are decent, however, take into account all of the extras you decide to add because it adds up. 

The only con would have to be the lineup, especially is you're a group of 5+. Me and my group of friends tend to wait about 20-25mins before getting a table during weekends, but the wait is worth it for the food and the price we pay."}
{"text":"I always go to Allo Mon Coco & Cosmopolitan for breakfast and wanted to try a new place. My friend keeps putting pictures of her amazing breakfasts at Petinos, so decided to try it out myself.
When we arrived, on a Saturday at 10:30am their was a line up, but it didn't take more than 10 minutes before we sat town. The menu has everything, from pancakes, to waffles, crepe, healthy choices like yogurt and fresh fruit, and some amazing combination like eggs and smoke meat. 

I opted for Le Versant which was 2 eggs, pancakes, fresh fruit and chose of meat (bacon, bologna, sausage, ham), potatoes, with a side of warm beans, toast and coffee or tea.

My friend ordered eggs with smoke meat, which was also accompanied with toast, potatoes and coffee or tea. We both also ordered fresh orange juice. Wish you very fresh and delicious

First of all portions are huge, the pancakes were thick and fluffy, really delicious, fruits were fresh and it was topped with some berry jam or marmalade which was something i hadn't seen before. Eggs were perfect, the waiter Nick was very nice and came by several time to see if we needed anything and made sure we everything was to our liking. The service was fast, taste was great, fresh and still hot. My friends smoke meat was really tasty, better than Schwartz or Nickels, thick juicy slices.

I also must add that the hostess at the door was super friendly and nice, she would greet everybody and the kids that were waiting in line to be seated she would offer them something to drink like orange juice or chocolate milk, which I that was going that extra mile. She whished everybody happy holidays when they were leaving. 

A wonderful family, friendly environment. I will definitely be coming back and bringing my whole family next time."}
{"text":"Got a surprise charge of $6 because we decided to share a plate. Waiter never told us there was an extra charge. If we had known about it, we would have each ordered an individual plate. We've never gotten charged because we shared a plate before, isn't the the whole point of sharing a plate paying for a single plate?"}
{"text":"Great menu, great food QUALITY (not just quantity), great price, great customer service. There's really nothing else to say. This place is, hands down, a national treasure."}
{"text":"Horrible experience, our waiter was rude and hostile, there was a hair in my plate and the food was alright nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and served really really fast!! Also, the service is great, the people there are very nice and do their best to accommodate you (we can be picky eaters...:p) The only thing is some of their items are a little overpriced but overall, would recommend!"}
{"text":"PS: Wrote this review whilst i was still digesting this breakfast ! 

Visiting Laval we decided to start our day at this breakfast/diner spot, having to wait 15-20 minute before getting a spot was definately worth the wait

The service is amazing everyone is really nice fast and precise ! The waiter is the type of person ud love to hear and laugh with to start off your day ! 

Monteregie section is where you have to go for your order eggs and waffle ! Make sure you call an ambulance for after your meal ! 

I had a special berry with nutella and eggs and my better half had this oreo storm with eggs ! 

I really recommend the potatoes with cheese and sauce 
Make sure u dont go for dinner that day"}
{"text":"They took us as a last minute reservation for 8; our waiter vanessa was wonderful.  I asked for the biggest cup of coffee and she literally brought me a HUUUGE cup. Best waitress ever. 

She was fast and efficient and super sweet with the baby at the table. 

The food was very good, with a lot of options. The hollandaise sauce was a tad salty but that's the only complaint.
 
Not over priced, big portions and good seating options. 

Plus, when I asked for hot sauce I got more then one option :D"}
{"text":"Really great service and portion sizes. I really liked the food but was not blown away. Would go again definitely but would not say it's a first choice."}
{"text":"Petinos is my favorite breakfast chain. Imagine my surprise when I notice one opened up in St-Jerome! Excellent spot to eat some grub as you make your way up from Montreal and past this growing township.

For someone who hasn't been to a Petinos, let me just say the menu is quite comprehensive... and they have never disappointed! I have had so many thing and they're on the top of the food chain when it comes to breakfast.

We came early so we didn't even get to wait, waitress was on top of her game and service was excellent. I went with a half waffle with nutella and bananas and it was orgasmic. I love their potatoes! Coffee is good, refills on the go with no issues.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Petinos is one of my favorite breakfast chains and I just found out they have a location in St-Laurent. It's a bit smaller than the others I've been to and one of the few things I didn't like about this location is that the booth we opted for which was to seat 4 was a real tight fit. It could have made use of another half foot for comfortable seating. The place is really busy and I'm not a fan of being cramped spaces.

I went with a half-waffle under a nice mountain of goodies with the standard far of eggs, sausage, etc. Breakfast was really good. Pricing was good. Service was surprisingly good, fast coffee refills and we were in and out in an hour. We came a little early to beat the rush and I'm happy we did since the queue when we left was outside the door... in minus -25 Celsius weather.

These peeps are committed."}
{"text":"Question dejeuner en ce qui me concerne Petinos est inbattable. Je recommande le plat demis gauffre avec nutella creme anglaise et fruits avec des oeufs choix bacon saucisse ou jambon et des frites excellent. La qualité de ceux qu'ils offrent font de Petinos ma place de choix pour dejeuner.

Allez y entre 6h-8h Lundi au Vendredi pour benificier des plats a 6-7$ c'est un bon deal!"}
{"text":"The best place for Breakfast after a wild night ! 
They are known for their delicionormous Waffles with fresh fruits English cream and all the good stuff . 

I usually stick to the \"Monteregie\" portion of the menu, where you can get the best of both worlds
(2Eggs +3Meats + Waffle )

I usually pay about 40$+ tip for 2 people. 
This is a Great price for the Quantity !!!! 

Arrive early this joint gets full very quickly on the weekends !"}
{"text":"My favorite is the waffles with Nutella and cream. Not to mention the petino potatoes with hollandaise sauce. Mm mm!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places to est when it comes to breakfast and even for dinner. It is always fresh and tastes so good, if you have a sugar rash it's good for you also. They have pancakes with fruits and a lot of Nutella on it, that's its to die for. Maybe it's to much sugar for in the morning but I have a sweet tooth all day long. The coffee is nice and most of the time there isn't a long wait queue. This place is well known and there are a lot of people in the morning, but you can always make a reservation just in case, but I never waited more than 3-5 minutes for a table. Service is pretty quick and the waiters are nice.

Pros: good food and fresh fruits. Nice if you like your pancakes drowned into Nutella. Bathrooms were clean, tables were dirty less. Menu has a lot of pages, not that expensive. 

Cons: nothing to complain about"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Food is very good. Perfect spot to have breakfast with kids. Generous portions. For breakfast I rate it 5 on 5. Flawless breakfast experience especially with 2 little boys. I'm very surprised there isn't much more reviews, maybe because it's open not long ago. Any bad reviews on this place must come from competition in my opinion or must come from people that don't go out to restaurants often for breakfast."}
{"text":"hands down my favorite spot to eat breakfast.... I have a big appetite and they have one dish that can satisfy it.. it comes with eggs, bacon, meats and half a waffle with custard, nutella and fruit. I love sweet and salty and I love waffles. That being said, trust me half a waffle is plenty, they are huge and so delicious. Anyways as far as prices go, they are competitive with all the other montreal \"fancy\" breakfast places I have been too, but their potatoes are the best and so are their combination plates... I mean when I got to another place and all they have for a waffle combo... is a plane waffle and it costs the same... Ill pass.


Ambiance.. what you would expect from a breakfast joint

Service.. quite good and hasty"}
{"text":"great place, love the aero gauffre, i love the staff, great service will definetely go back! Try the soups are amazing!"}
{"text":"First time here with my family.  Foods awesome!  Omelette, eggs, waffles, breads, crepes, so good be careful to use the direction in yelp, it points you to a newly developed residential area.  If you look in the google map destination, it is showing 1160...instead of 540.  This restaurant is located in a big mall where Walmart is located.  Very good price too!!!  My first 5 star rating!!!"}
{"text":"Being an omellette guy i am very strick on my ratings. I ordered thier charcoal chicken and it was just ok. I asked if the can add some roaemary and i was told no!!! While allo mon coco always does. Taate was very flat. This is why i hate eating out as i make amazing omellettea. Would i go back?? Probably with friends but not for my aelf."}
{"text":"Amazing service.. The best till date that I have had in Montreal.. Food is above expectations as well.. Nutella banana english cream waffles are to die for.. Veggie omelette with fries and fruits was just superb.. Our server was so nice that when she saw we hadn't ordered any meats on the table she told us not to eat beans as they might contain pork.. Loved the whole experience!"}
{"text":"If you wish there were a place in or near West Island, Montréal to have a delicious Saturday morning breakfast when you roll out of bed at 12. This is your spot! 
From all the classic choices to some of the best \"comfort-food style\" breakfast dishes. The best thing is that it won't hurt your wallet too badly. (My wife and I left completely full for just over $30)"}
{"text":"Drove by this new restaurant, so the wife and I decided to try it out.

We went for breakfast, and it was delicious! Eggs and bacon were perfectly cooked, fruit was fresh and the coffee refills were plentiful. Nice friendly service, too.

We'll be going back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Nous étions a Ville Saint-Laurent et cherchions un endroit pour bruncher lorsque une recherche sur Yelp a retourné cet établissement. Quelle merveilleuse découverte. Le décor est sobre le personnel très professionnel. Par contre l endroit est très bruyant et il faut parler fort pour ce faire comprendre de la serveuse..

Les assiettes sont généreuses et le prix raisonnable."}
{"text":"Breakfast at Petino's was awesome. Let's me preface this by saying first and foremost THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE. I could only finish half of my breakfast! 

Seriously my family ate gooooooood here hahaha The staff was so nice, and our food came out quickly. It was perfect because we filled up before our awesome hike at Mount Royal. I love when I stumble upon a little gem in a town I know nothing about."}
{"text":"I go here quite often, the portion are generous, there is a good variety on the menu and the staff is quick enough. Out of the five times I've been the food was always perfectly cooked though I always order breakfast items like crêpes, pancakes and eggs. I would definitely recommend for a casual breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Very yummy breakfast!!! Great place, atmosphere is amazing and they accommodated a group of 6 + one that arrived 15 mins later. Thank you Petinos"}
