{"text":"WOW, what a meal!   The service was absolutely top notch and the ambiance was very intimate and made me feel like I was at home.  We started off with the calamari appetizer which was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.   Four of us had filet mignon for dinner and the meat was as tender as it could have been cooked. Additionally, the asparagus on the side was cooked to perfection, which is something very hard to do. The other member of our party had the spaghetti alla sorrentina. The mozzarella melted very nicely into the pasta and the sauce was divine (very large portion).   For dessert we shared the spumoni. Beautiful presentation and flavor. Moreover, we were given a complimentary ravioli dessert which was wonderful (a word that can be used to describe every aspect of the restaurant).   This is one of our new favorite Vegas restaurants and we will be frequenting on every subsequent trip."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the pleasure of dining here on September 24. Five stars aren't nearly enough to describe our experience. We started with 2 glasses of red wine and a meatball appetizer that was reminiscent of dining at a South Philadelphia Italian restaurant. The meatballs were accompanied by warm bread, which we used to sop up the \"gravy.\"   Osso Bocco is my favorite dish and this was the best I ever had. Veal shanks aren't normally meaty, but these were. The high quality of the veal was immediately recognizable and the portion was generous, as well.   My wife ordered veal picante, which was also good, but we both agreed that the osso bocco was the star of the evening.   When we considered the overall experience, the price was not unreasonable.  The atmosphere was relaxing and conducive to leisurely dining, which is a rarity in Las Vegas. The service was right up there, too. The owner provided us with some nice little extras and made us feel like we were guests in his home. This put an already lovely meal, over the top for us. My wife has decided this is where she wants to celebrate her birthday, in January."}
{"text":"What an amazing place for dinner. The ambience & service is outstanding.  Francesco was our server. We started with a glass of Pinot then a Caesar salad bread & butter. Our filet was cooked perfectly with the au gratin potatoes as well as the asparagus. (Order the  beranasie sauce) before dessert they brought out lime cello to cleanse our palate. Dessert was the table side banana foster, well worth it. This is a great place for a nice dinner or a special occasion."}
{"text":"Two words: MIND BLOWING.  For an off strip restaurant, my dinner party and I were blown away.  Our server was Alessandro and was amazing.  Ask for him!  His knowledge of the menu, service and overall care for us was about as good as it gets.  Super personable, funny, informative and nice.  We all had pasta of various types and really it was fantastic.  Tuna tartare starter was great... but at the end... the cherries jubilee??  That was the star of the show.  We'll be back.  Please try this place out.  Just a short taxi or 15 minute walk from the convention center area if you're in town for an exhibition of some sort."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner. Food was great. I even enjoyed their calamari - and I don't like seafood. I ordered the Filet - and it was cooked perfectly. The manager came over, and the wait staff was very attentive. They even offered us complimentary proseco and dessert. Lovely! Will go back when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"great food and good drinks go in when LULU is there! And u will have a great Time Call this Bartender anytime on phone they will keep you Laughing!"}
{"text":"New for me, but they seemed to give us that \"why are you eating here\" vibe.... Food was just ok and didn't have me thinking i should return... The food was just ok, and really overpriced... But what do you expect from an italian joint on paradise... Buca is not even a quarter mile away... we shared a Cesar salad and calamari and chicken parmesan and... this came to 58 dollars... Normally someone would order this just for one... for that price you can feed a family of 4 at Buca...."}
{"text":"My wife Linda and I ate here in late June.  It was a great meal, great service, and great atmosphere.  And it wasn't the cheapest.  We felt we got what we paid for.  It is nice to have a place we can dress nicely and feel special  and a little decadent.  I get pasta at Italian, so I can't comment on the steaks other than they appeared to be reasonable priced for the type of restaurant this is.  I had the meat ravioli (braise short rib and truffle I believe) and mad yummy sounds with every bite.  Linda had a flavorful red sauce pasta (not sure what now) and also raved. It didn't hurt that they had primed us with a complimentary glass of bubbly when we entered.  That and the wine we had left us happy and sated.  When we met the owner last Tuesday, and raved to him about his establishment, I felt I had to put the same praise online.  Thanks for a great evening."}
{"text":"Such an amazing restaurant! In a city where everything is flashy and centered around the strip, it's a very comforting feeling being here, just a few blocks away. Delicious food, great wine. The staff is very nice and so helpful. Feels like having nice family meal at home. Will always come back here during every Vegas trip."}
{"text":"We had dinner yesterday night after seeing the great reviews on Yelp. The service was great, James did a great job! He was attentive and very professional. I had the Veal Piccata al Limone e Capperi and i was disappointed! My boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon, great quality but needs seasoning. The meal was over priced for the amount of food on the plate. The ambince is lovely and the service was great; in my opinion this steakhouse has average food for high end prices."}
{"text":"Saw their lunch sign, 9.99 lunch buffet, decided to stop. The restaurant was nice inside, but empty. When my server came to take my order I said I was having the buffet, this is when he informed me that it's vegetarian, just veggies. I appreciate him telling me before I made the mistake. I feel this is deceptive advertising, had the sign said vegetarian buffet I wouldn't have gone in. So I proceeded to order an Italian chicken dish which was so short of good. Tough, sauce w no zing, nothing I'd ever go back for. I have a bistro on the corner in my neighborhood 50x's better food and 1/3 the price, think ill stick to that."}
{"text":"Superb service from the entire staff.  I felt like a queen in all her glory.  The brought complimentary bruschetta,  and mini dessert. Very nice touch.    I had the lobster ravioli,  it was perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious,  and savory.  They also have a vast Wine list to choose from."}
{"text":"Arrived a bit rumpled from a long day of driving, but were welcomed as graciously as if we'd been wearing tiaras. Our server, Mauro, was very attentive and kind, and sensitive to our gluten issues. The petit filet was superb, as were the truffled mashed potatoes, and everything else that came our way. Even the gentleman who kept our water glasses filled and fresh was very nice and on his toes. We were delighted with our whole experience."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch because they had a patio and would allow the dogs to join us on the porch. Bryan the server was the highlight as his service and disposition were excellent. The pepperoni pizza my son ordered was $17 and under cooked. My daughter had the meatballs and they were okay, but nothing to really stand out. My wife got a Cesar salad and it was very bland and small. The Mellon and prosciutto appetizer was $18 and only had 5 pieces! Given all that Vegas culinary has to offer I would skip this one."}
{"text":"Rare is the opportunity to visit a place like Vegas and stumble across a brand new restaurant. We found ourselves in that position at Toscano. We walked in on just its second night of business.   It was the Presidents' Day weekend, so Vegas was jam packed. Yet this stunning spot was largely empty. At first we didn't understand why, and we continued to be perplexed as excellent food was delivered by a highly solicitous service staff. We learned later that the restaurant was just getting started.  As for the food - maybe the best calamari I ever had, served with delicious marinara sauce; excellent fresh shellfish--some of it in a pleasing cioppino and the rest in a linguine dish; solid escargot (some French dishes, too!); terrific ravioli in lobster sauce; and elegant truffle mashed potatoes.  The dining rooms are magnificent. Dark wood and leaded glass. We were told this used to be a Ruth's Chris Steak House, so the new proprietors walked into a nearly turn-key space.            Toscano is in a highly competitive environment in a tough town. We wish them well and hope they have a long run. If you go, you will, too."}
{"text":"The service Aldo provided was superb and gave  excellent recommendations. The food was well made, nicely presented and very timely delivered. My group and I were highly impressed. We would highly recommend eating at this establishment."}
{"text":"Good Italian restaurant.  Expensive, but the quality is very good.  The breads were warmed. Calamari Fritti was so good that we were unable to stop and almost regretted it because the portion was generous and affected our ability to fully consume subsequent dishes. Linguini with lobster tail was so flavorful. Filet Mignon was a perfect medium rare and great with the BÃ©arnaise sauce. Potato au Gratin was baked crispy outside and juicy inside. And Tiramisu was the bomb!  Solid place to enjoy traditional-ish Italian steakhouse."}
{"text":"We went there for the lunch special. I'm not sure why yelp said it was closed? We are outside on the patio, under the umbrella, very nice.  I got the salmon and my boyfriend got the veal Coleta. They gave us a bottle of wine for $30 which was delicious as was the food! Our Italian  server was nice and very fast! We had a great experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm so sad this place closed down ... They had the most amazing steaks and caprese salad. The owners were very nice Gorgia and Francisco. It was a hidden gem of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A GEM in the Desert!!!! .....DELICIOUS!!  ....We had a party of 7. Everyone raved about their dish. My veal piccata was wonderful with just the perfect amount of lemon. My husband had the Osso Bucco  which fell off the bone... Another had the Lobster Pasta , they loved it!  You get the picture...everything was wonderful from the bruschetta to the desserts!!! Service was great, our waiter very friendly and helpful with our wines and choices...Very Friendly owners came to make sure everything was good, very friendly atmosphere. FIVE STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a 22 ounce steak while my wife had the pasta. The food and atmosphere are both excellent. This is not a cheap restaurant- everything is alla carte so you pay for salad,  or whatever else you want with your steak. The wine list is good but be prepared to spend 12-15 for a glass of vino. Overall enjoyed it but will limit my visits due to the cost and other Italion restaurants that are available and not quite as expensive. However, the food and atmosphere are both very good. Pasta is home made"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great wine list, awesome Caesars salad and lasagna!  Really good authentic Italian food and music in a prior Ruth Chris location."}
{"text":"I've been totally on the fence about writing a review for Toscano. Had a groupon for $50, but still ended up paying additional $60 out of pocket...for 2 people! And neither of us had steak. Husband reported his lobster ravioli to be flavorful. My duck was two very small breasts...and what I would swear were INSTANT mashed potatoes. As some others have reported, I found everything, from the soup to the sauces, lacking in seasoning. We waited 30 minutes for the finale: creme brulee. I think they made it from scratch; but at least they made it (I've been to so many places in Vegas where it is on the menu, but they never have it!). I kind of felt like they could have comp'ed the cappuccinos we had while we were waiting so long.  Service was good and the decor was upscale. My biggest peeve of the night: the chairs were TOO HIGH for the table we were at. I felt like a buzzard,  hunched over my meal.  No other huge complaints. Just didn't feel the food was special enough--at those prices--to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and the service is absolutely top notch! This a great, and quiet little gem. We arrived right at 6 pm, and were immediately seated. They have a great range of Italian dishes, as well as a robust selection of steaks. Our waiter even brought us a complimentary dessert sample with a sip of a tasty night cap. Give this place a try, it's reasonably priced and you will really enjoy both the food, service and ambience."}
{"text":"Maybe we caught them on a bad night but we were 1 of 4 tables in the place on a Thursday evening.  The food was average at best and it seemed like something I could have done better at home.  We ordered the veal, osso buco, and some pasta.  The price was way too high compared to the quality of the food.  I felt bad for the waiter because the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm hooked!!! I use YELP a lot. However, OPEN TABLE sent me a NEW restaurant open thing. So, me & my woman went to check it out. I was back the next day!!! Enough said! Lol people check this place out. I know it's a rule of thumb to wait about 6-months before going into a fairly new place...so the can get the kinks out. Just go I think you'll love it. ENTERTAINMENT for sure"}
{"text":"I am a foodie and love to compare food, steakhouses in particular. I must say that this place ranks with some of the best filet mignon I have had in my life. The service was great atmosphere was nice and everything we ordered was good. Will def be back"}
{"text":"Was amazing last year me and my girlfriend had the absolutely best time but it's closed and is a Brazilian steakhouse but still has same sign and outdoor menus from toscano I even had a confirmed reservation for toscano be warned"}
{"text":"This place is amazing party of 6 amazing service, every meal was delicious, had to save room for desert made by a side cart. Live music, live lobster, no wait for this 12,000 sq foot restaurant."}
{"text":"Five of us had dinner here on a Thursday night.  It was not busy at all, just a few other tables filled around us.  The restaurant is actually pretty large with several sections.  We weren't sure if we'd have two more joining us, so they accommodated us by putting the five of us at a table for eight, which I thought was nice.  Our server was AWESOME.  He was friendly and attentive throughout the meal and chatted with us like a friend.  We really appreciated him!  The other staff were also friendly and professional, we were checked on and taken care of by multiple other people, too.  I, and one of our friends, ordered the Pappardelle Zafferano e Gamberi, which was shrimp with pappardelle pasta in a wonderfully flavorful and creamy saffron sauce.  Saffron is so delicate, but tasty and it went really nicely with the shrimp.  That was enough to fill me up.  My husband had the lasagna and he must have hated it because he made it disappear in about 5 minutes flat. Another friend had the Tortellini Ripieni con Brasato and Black Truffle, she is so cute and thought that short rib would be a barbecue flavor! She loved her dish as well, but since she started with onion soup, she shared the pasta with everyone... well, except me because I was already too full!  Her husband had a filet mignon and it was a beautiful steak - he added the asparagus, but I thought it was a little pricey at $9 for the 3 spears served. But, every piece of food that we ate was delicious.  Some had drinks, I just had iced tea and literally, the iced tea was the ONLY negative of the visit because it didn't taste very good - like it was out of a machine.  We topped off dinner with shared creme brulees.  YUM  Other than that, this was a wonderful meal and a wonderful experience and, oh, did I mention that we got 20% off for checking in on yelp?  Seriously, for five it was under $200, so I thought it was a pretty good deal for the quality of food and service.  I highly recommend Toscano Italian Steakhouse.  They have a great selection of food that will make your taste-buds happy."}
{"text":"Went there last night (Sat.) @ 8 pm. There was no host and waited about 10 min. & left. The place was really slow which was odd for a traditional date night."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by the food. We had the chef tasting of pasta fagioli, Ceasar salad, fettuccine alfredo, and lemon butter sole & spumoni. Everything lacked flavor and the pasta was under cooked. The best part of the meal was the spumoni. I can't say enough about the service though. The waiter was friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Great food! Exceptional service thank you tommy. Definitely a great dining experience. Will be a regular here. Vegas hidden gem."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant in November 2015, sign on door said \"closed due to non patent of rent\""}
{"text":"What a dining experience! From the valet to the last bite of dessert this place was top notch.  The service was absolutely amazing, the decor warm and cozy, and the food was delectable, flavorful, perfect in every way.   Toscano is located in The Park at 3900 plaza, next to the old Firefly where the former Ruth Chris/Kelly's Steakhouse were. I think Toscano is going to fare much better than its predecessors though.   Appetizer - tuna tartare. This was awesome. Fresh and delicious served beside perfectly seasoned crispy crostini.  Salad - Caprese salad. This was a large salad, so my boyfriend and I were able to share it. This just knocked my socks off. I have never had such a delicious caprese salad in my life. As I write this review I want to jump into my car and drive over there for some more! Four large slices of tomato topped with delicious, buttery mozzarella, shaved strips of basil, and served with kalamata olives. The amount of oil and seasonings was perfect. Hands down - BEST CAPRESE EVER.  Main course - surf and turf. My boyfriend and I decided to share this since the tuna tartare and caprese were large enough portions. I don't eat meat, but he said the steak was phenomenal. The lobster was served with drawn butter, absolutely perfect.  It came baked, and though I usually prefer mine steamed it didn't make any difference last night!   Dessert - we opted for the traditional tiramisu. I loved how it was served in a martini glass - definitely added to the presentation. And of course - it was to die for!  We ended up dining pretty late - in fact we were the last ones there. The servers and staff never let on that we were keeping them. They were absolutely great about everything.  I'd definitely recommend this place for a nice night out. I'd even go there with my friends for a nice glass of wine, to share a dish, and split a dessert.  If I could give this place 10 stars I would! It is a quiet, family owned restaurant, and the values of hard work and dedication show in their food, presentation, and service. Definitely go check them out."}
{"text":"This used to be the old Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, so the interior appointments were elegant.  I understand the business only recently opened, but it was Saturday night in Vegas and the town was packed , but at 8 pm the place was nearly empty.  We ordered the kale salad with lemon vinegrette, excellent, and a fois gras appetizer, tender, rich and delicious.  The main course was a chicken parm, well-prepared, but did not have much in the way of Italian marinara flavor. It was more like a pan fried piece of chicken with melted cheese.  ($26).  Everything here is a la carte, so it didn't even come with a side dish of pasta. Service was very good , but my overall impression of the restaurant was \"overpriced\" and \"good,\" but not excellent under Las Vegas standards."}
{"text":"I came to Toscano to see a show and I decided to have dinner first.  My table was waiting with a name tag on it when I was shown into the restaurant.  I ordered from the menu rather than getting their special Valentine's Day menu.  I was quickly brought an iced tea and some bread and butter.  In a short time, the calamari I ordered for an appetizer was brought.  It was lightly breaded and fried briefly.  It was served with a marinara sauce that was tasty but it was not spicy as the menu indicated.  For the main course, I got pappardelle in saffron sauce with shrimp.  It was good although I thought the shrimp were a bit chewy.  The saffron sauce was quite good.  Before ordering a dessert, my server brought me a complimentary tiramisu.  Perhaps it was because of my dinner and show reservations because everyone in the side room where I ate were going to the show, too, and they all got the tiramisu.  Service was very good.  The server addressed me by name throughout the evening and he was around to check to see how everything was during the meal.  The Gary Colombo Showroom is right off the dining room and they plan on having ongoing shows of various kinds with dinner available before/after the performances."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The service was great. Our waiter was extremely attentive and caring. He suggested the lobster linguini and it was amazing, the sauce was amazing, it was great. It definitely wasn't an item on their menu, but I get the impression that when people are hesitant and don't know what they want he'll jump in and suggest a dish that the chef cab customize for the group, (which was our case). Love the ambiance and the service there."}
{"text":"Please don't pass this place by. A few blocks off the strip but a few blocks closer to perfection. Went there for our 31st anniversary and it couldn't have been better. Went last year to Ramsays Steak and they sucked. Great service, great food. Good wine list that doesn't break the bank. Go check out the menu. Everything we had and I mean everything was perfect. Rib Eye was so flavorful and filling. Caesar Salad was wonderful. If you get the chance ask to be in Slater's section.Todd will make your Banana's foster and we even had Prosciutto sliced directly at the table as an appetizer which was a first for me. Go give them a try. Great service that is worth every penny. Less expensive than most of the steak houses on the strip."}
{"text":"Too bad 6 stars arent available. We decided on Toscano for our 44th anniversary. Greatest anniversary dinner ever! The food was outstanding, the atmosphere was exactly what you want in an Italian Vegas steak house. Very upscale but intimate. The icing on the cake was our service from Kodi. We mentioned our anniversary in passing and he took it to the top! Brought little complimentary extras to the table during evening making the experience unforgetable. Found our new place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Toscano's is a gem of a restaurant! The food, drinks and dessert were all top-notch, as was the service. The place itself is done very tastefully, with a chill ambiance and a classy atmosphere.   I ordered the Toscanini Ripieni, which was creamy and delicious. The gimlet was smooth and satisfying, and the creme broulee was some of the best I've ever had.   Bryan, our server, was perfectly attentive. He made good recommendations and made us feel right at home. He even offered a sample of their specialty dessert, on the house.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely make it a point to come eat here again! I was extremely satisfied with my dinner at Toscano's."}
{"text":"Hidden secret= no wait times! This newly reopened , new ownership= a new experience! I've been back a few times now! The steaks are top notch! The duck was so amazingly flavorful, accompanied by truffled mashed potatoes! The cioppino was packed with fresh seafood! The caprese sad has the freshest mozzarella and olive oil that I can imagine.  The only disappointment is the bread has been changed! Since I don't go out for bread, I'm happy to not feel compelled to eat it all!!!!"}
{"text":"food is fair at best..so bland with little taste. Boring sauces with little flavor. The quality of the ingredients are very good. The service and atmosphere are tops .  Hire a new chef!! I won't return. A restaurant for the 65 and over crowd. Live bar music for the 70 and over crowd. So many better options to choose from."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant with impeccable service.   I ordered the calamari based on the reviews.  It was good, but nothing special.  I agree with some other reviewers that it was under seasoned.  The lobster ravioli was very tasty.  The sauce was delicious.  The bananas foster did not disappoint.  It was the definite highlight of the meal.    I would not go out of my way to go to this restaurant while in Vegas, but I had a wonderful dining experience here."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding!  We came for a late lunch on saturday and the hostess remembered us from the previous weekend when we came on Sunday the previous week and were told the weren't open for lunch on Sunday.  They were all so friendly and the calamari was great!  We were even brought complimentary bruschetta with mozzarella and prosciutto. They make you feel like s cherished guest!"}
{"text":"Excellent! I've been the Golden Steer many times this place is right up there.  Great steaks! Big portions-great taste-excellent Malbec & service.  They treated us like kings!  Nice ambience and no crowds. Check it out before the Firefly bunch tires of health inspection raids."}
{"text":"Had the ciopinno and risotto. Very nice flavor! It is run by Romans who were very friendly and accommodating. The price was reasonable. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"We received great service and exceptional food. The location is convinetly located by the strip. Live music,  family friendly staff.   I ordered chicken parmigiana and French fries. Both items were proportioned very well and perfect for the price."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and ordered  1. Calamari Fritti, 11 - Lightly breaded and fried calamari served with a spicy marinara sauce 2. Guazzetto Cozze e Vongole, 16 - Fresh clams and mussel sautÃ©ed in a light tomato garlic sauce with crostini 2. Pappardelle Zafferano e Gamberi, 22  - Large fettuccine pasta in creamy saffron sauce with shrimp 3. Risotto alla Pescatora, 22 - Clams, Mussels, Shrimp and Calamari for $36.89 (Used a Groupon valued at $60 for $30)  - Next to Del Frisco. I think this used to be Chris Ruth's.  - Excellent service from beginning to end. Commendable.  - Kenny, our server, was very entertaining and friendly. One of the most memorable servers we've ever had. Never had to ask for more water, napkins, taking pictures. anything. Courteous and respectful.  - Calamari was crispy and flavorful.  - The tomato garlic sauce was so good we used the remaining on the bread!  - The fettuccine pasta was exquisite. Loved the texture of the pasta. Master chef status.  - Lots of silverware! A bit excessive.  - Brusheta with tomato on the house. Compliments of the chef. Great!  - After we ate, we sat at their lounge and enjoyed the live singing. They served us armaretto and dessert ravioli, on the house, with extra refills. Very romantic and relaxing.  - Hidden gem. Best Italian in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I could hear the servers in their service station all huddled together cussing loud enough for me to hear. Not very classy. Needless to say the food was good, but you can get great meals anywhere in this city. Service is what sets it apart. Not a fan"}
{"text":"prepare to be impressed! i enjoyed the vegetable lunch buffet today which was superb! my mate had the chicken piccata which was accompanied with asparagus spears and mashed potatoes - a basket of warm bread was provided as well. the vino is a bit pricey, but was top of the line and would not deter my return. the ambiance and service remind of bygone days in vegas. give them a try - you will be back!"}
