{"text":"We tried a lot of things for the very first time at Crust simply Italian in Chandler, mozzarella encarozza, if you don't know, are like the best mozzarella cheese sticks that have ever been made on the face of the earth they are the size of a piece of bread and it's served with some killer marinara sauce. The bruschetta board is really good, apple and figs, lots of different cheeses strawberries so delicious. And of course we got a couple of 20 inch round New York thin crust pizzas,DELISH!  When we came back later on we got basically one of every dessert, their butter cake is so good, we went downstairs to the speakeasy (dress code, no shorts...we were fine) called The Ostridge, great atmosphere lots of cool mugshot  pictures and really excellent wait staff. Good drink prices no need to go anywhere else had a great time will be back next year."}
{"text":"Yelp says open tell midnight. Walked in and made eye contact with two servers. Sat down at the bar and waited five minutes for one of the servers we initially made eye contact with to come up and tell us you are closed at 10:00. Might want to change your hours if you don't want people to think you're open, and you might not want your guest to watch your servers discuss and point at us from a corner deciding which one is going to have to talk to us."}
{"text":"The look was nice but the part-owner I met was the absolute rudest person I've met in a long time. His condescending persona seems more suited to snottsdale than chandler.  Based on his mannerisms I'm not sure if it's a taste of the \"Crust\" experience or an unfortunate interaction with a tasteless person. I wouldn't recommend it. I think they are preying on the tourist and San Tan Brewery overflow. San Tan Brewery is always worth the wait."}
{"text":"We have been here three times now and the service has been excellent! We are just waiting for the food to be consistent. Our first visit we ordered the Little Nicky pizza and added sausage, it was so delicious there was the perfect amount of all the toppings, we loved so much we boxes it togo. Second visit was not as enjoyable, skinny pesto pizza was too thin to pick up and CRUST was burnt. Third visit tried garlic knots to start and half of them were burnt so bad no one ate them, so we went back to we loved, the Little Nicky, unfortunately it was awful, there was barley any cheese or flavor to the pie and it was under cooked :( we will give it one more try!"}
{"text":"Went to crust last night with one of my girlfriends to kick off my bday week. We were seated immediately and brought menus and water. Waitress told us $5 wine until 6 and 1/2 off bottles. Yay! We ordered a bottle and ordered garlic knots which were free because we signed up for their text specials. Waitress was great, attentive and patient since we had a hard time deciding what to order. We decided on the Greek salad(which was served over a pizza crust bowl) and the original rustica pizza. Meal was great as well as the wine. Manager/owner made a point if asking how our meal was. Great atmosphere and staff!! Will be going back! They are opening up a Speak Easy downstairs which we got a tour of. VERY cool! Going to be a great place to hang out downtown! Opening October 1st, bring your friends!  Nice addition to DC!"}
{"text":"Stoped in for a light dinner and sat in the bar area. Great food and even better service by the bartender Jessica!!  She was amazing at suggestions for us and just a straight forward person with a awesome personality.   My recommendation ..... sit in the bar area and make sure Jessica is working. :)"}
{"text":"Worst service, rude, completely messed up entire order and didn't do anything to try and fix it. We just stayed hungry for the night"}
{"text":"Love the look and feel of the place inside. It is a great addition to Downtown Chandler area. Went on a Saturday night so it was pretty packed, one thing that I did notice was that it was really load in there. I could barely hear the person across the table without them practically  shouting. This of course could change when the weather is nice and the patio and bar top doors are open. I have no issue with the loudness just want to warn other people if they were expecting a quite romantic Italian place.  Getting to the food.  We both ordered the pizza which was exelent. I had Crust pizza a while back and was super excited that one was coming to the SE Valley. It did live up to my high expectations. Will be back soon probably to check out the awesome happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"We went on a Monday for happy hour. Happy hour was 3p to 6p. Drink specials were $3 beer, $5 wine and half off mixed drinks on menu. I had pumpkin beer which was good esp at that price. We both ordered off happy hour menu which is a select group of items for $5. We had mozzarella encorrozza and the original rustics. Both were large portion sizes and we had leftover pizza. The rustics was good. Wait staff was attentive and ambiance was good. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Crust Restaurants since the opening over 10 years ago.  Since Crust Chandler opened, it is by far one of our favorite places to go eat and drink.  I recently got the Goodness Greenness salad and it was delicious.  It was so fresh and very lite.  It had roasted Brussels sprouts and big chunks of sweet potatoes and chicken.  It is my new favorite salad!  The service is always exceptional and the staff is so friendly and food comes out hot and fast!  Downstairs is the Ostrich bar which has craft cocktails and such a cool atmosphere!  I truly love Crust and highly recommend coming here for amazing, traditional Italian food."}
{"text":"I would have given this place almost 5 stars except the music is too loud. I can understand it on Friday and Saturday night, but not on a Tuesday.  If you want to have a conversation with someone go out to the patio which isn't quite so loud. I had eggplant parmesan that came with pasta and a roll. I really liked the presentation. The sauce was great. It had just a tiny bite. The eggplant parm was a bit different than what I am used to and a welcome change. The roll was just a touch on the dry side but still tasty. The service was excellent. Our server was Tatiana who was attentive and friendly. I recommend this place. Great deals during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Food alone is great.  This rating is based on service alone. The pizza is great, comes out hot, fresh, and is sooo good.  I have been to crust twice... both in September... the first time, was during their (I think) soft opening during lunch and the waitress was distracted or just not too attentive, but I kind of chalked this up to new place, new process, training, etc. plus it was end of lunch rush, etc... The next time we went, was during their \"official grand opening\" for dinner and the waiter we had was not good... just not interested.  For example, he took my wife's drink (iced tea) away and without asking to refill, etc.  I advised the waiter shes wasn't done and requested her refill, and by my interpretation of his expression, he appeared bothered by that request.  Overall we felt rushed, like a number, and we would've stayed for dessert, but the waiter never asked or offered us a choice.  We paid the bill and ate dessert somewhere else.  I might go back...maybe service will be better?"}
{"text":"Delious food! Loved the stuffed mushrooms and Stromboli!  Servers were very attentive and fast. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, I'm in a pizza rut but it's a damn good rut! I order the NY style pizza with pepperoni n mushrooms every Friday after work. 4x so far since they opened! Always ready when told it would be, always warm, tasty and perfect pizza gooey! The staff has always been friendly and quick to ask how may I help you! Anxious to try the new Ostrich bar in the basement! This is s great addition to the downtown Chandler food and entertainment district!"}
{"text":"Service is horribly slow, there was four tables and been waiting for an appetizer for 45 minutes. Can only imagine how long to get my food. Oh wait, my food came before my appetizer. Anyway, this is the first review I have ever written as I'm pretty easy going and like to give the benefit of the doubt. I will not be returning to this place as there are way to many other better options. Worst 90 bucks ever spent for a dinner for 4....... Good Luck"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!  We were seated quickly and contact with Richard our waiter. Place was fairly busy for a  Friday evening.  Texted for free garlic knots!  Pretty good. Wife and I had the rustic pizza $5 with the Cesar salad. Daughter had linguine and three huge meatballs!  She loved it brought leftovers home.  The pizza was good had the NY and the rustic.  NY was the best!  The Rustic was good just a little to much sauce for the dough to hold up. The Cesar was excellent!  Did not skimp on the dressing and loved the crostini!  Looking forward to going back and trying more items."}
{"text":"Great food.  Staff was attentive and very helpful.  The garlic knots are delicious.  They kept 1/2 our pizza warm while we ate.  Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Four of us ate lunch here today, big disappointment. It's been about a year since we last ate here, but we were in the mood for pizza. The pizza dough was like eating cardboard, tough, too crunchy - I would rate the pizza a '1' on a scale of 10.  The Ambiance is OK, the waiter was nice, it's the only reason I gave this experience two stars. We will not return, too many other choices in the area."}
{"text":"Glad to have a GREAT pizza place in DT Chandler!  The food was delicious top off with outstanding service.  Our waiter was attentive to our needs and made great food suggestions.  Can't wait for cooler weather so we can ride our bikes and enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a birthday with family. Food was great and the service was outstanding! We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a date night and it was great. We sat at the bar and had great service! Teddy was our bartender and very friendly. The food was great, the drinks were delicious and the environment was inviting. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Another great addition to the downtown Chandler restaurant scene.   The décor, service, and  food were all wonderful.  They have only been open two weeks and appear to be on their way to being one of the top destinations in DC. Enjoyed a mista salad and two different types of pizza, one veggie, one more traditional.   Our servers were informative, personable, and above all attentive.   If you like a good wood fired pizza, you are going to love this place."}
{"text":"Dined for dinner with a group of almost 20 people. The owner, managers and wait staff did an amazing job  at accomodating and serving the group! Amazing appetizers and canoli's for dessert!  Thank you to the the owners and staff for a fun evening out!"}
{"text":"Warm greeting when we walked in it was slow so they said we can sit anywhere my high maintenance fiance requested the biggest booth in the restaurant ofcourse and they still said yes even though there's only two of us:)  Not just our waitress but the other employees we ran into were extremely friendly and helpful and they told us some of the hot spots to go to after we had dinner here  I ordered the the Manhattan and the Little John Pizza and my fiance had some skinny margarita nonsense and the chicken pesto Pizza all the items were very orgasmic  And the service was even better they never said no they just made it happen :-)"}
{"text":"The service here is TERRIBLE!  There is never anyone at the door to greet or seat you so you stand there awkwardly.  The service is SUPER slow.  They also over-charge the heck out of everything.  They charged me $20 for a LUNCH SALAD!!!!!!!  And when I asked the manager about it to correct it, they took $2.50 off.  My server was clueless and didn't know a single question we asked her.  Their catering also sucks - they showed up 2 hours late with half the amount of food they were supposed to have.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Although we made reservations they didn't have a table ready for about 15 minutes. Then they moved us. 20 minutes later after asking a hostess a waiter finally appeared. 20 minutes after ordering drinks and apps we had to ask for a manager because we haven't even received waters yet. The waiter was very nice! But nothing else was even remotely acceptable. I've been in the industry for 14 years. I'm very patient. I'll never come back. They brought out half the pizza and then 15 minutes later we got the rest of the pizza. Weird. The Mac and cheese was hot but dry. Didn't think you could mess up Mac and cheese. The pizza wasn't curable with regular knives, too hard and chewy. So disappointed. Sad."}
{"text":"Went there on Halloween day for lunch.  We sat at the bar.  The bartender was nice but so overwhelmed... even though the place was practically empty.  There were five couples seated at the bar and he managed to get every order incorrect.  Service took forever.  Probably waited 15 minutes just to order a drink.  Again it was not busy at all.  Now for the food.  We had a pizza and a caprese salad.  The caprese salad was awful.  It was on a bed of iceberg lettuce and really lacked any flavor whatsoever.  The pizza, on the other hand, was wonderful and that's why I give Crust 3 starts.  Only for the pizza.  Since this was my first visit, I will be back and hopefully the service and the other food items are better than this visit."}
{"text":"This place is the worst! I would not recommend anyone to come here. We came on a Friday night around 7 o'clock. We were told it would be about a 20 minute wait. After almost an hour of waiting a Manager came up to tell us how \"transparent\" he would be and that we could expect a table around 11:00 PM. The entire patio was open except for one table. We were told that due to fire code we could not pull tables together. Then a table opened up inside that we were told we could sit at got bumped for a reservation. Finally after an 1:15 minutes we were sat outside. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and took good care of us. Unfortunately the same Manager that told us we could get a table at 11:00 PM came out to chat. I asked if he could do anything to help rectify the situation. He told me he would send his GM out. She came out and this is where the night went really south. I have never come across a more condescending, rude employee in my life. She had zero compassion and talked down to us the entire time. We expressed that we would not be back due to our experience and she did not care. Due to her lack of compassion and condescending tone we will never be back again and I would recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"Well they are open til 10pm on weeknights but kitchen closes at 9pm so fair warning!  The boss just chased us out.  Last time I was here it was okay.  The Ostrich downstairs was fun but expensive. Good luck if you come on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Fast service and heaters on the patio!! Ordered the calamari as an appetizer, which was good. Selected the Little Nicki pizza and added sausage, the 20 inch for two people. 8 LARGE slices. They only bring half the pizza out because its so big they know they will have to box the rest. VERY good!! The table next to us ordered the garlic knots, may have to try those next time, they also looked amazing. And they also got the sangria that came out in a caraf with two glasses, there may be a deal there, not sure!! Reasonably priced for the amount of food you get!! Will be back to try the pasta or calzone next!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Appetizers were good recommend the bruschetta. pastas cooked excellent. Chicken francese  was sent back not as good as expected. Deserts were above average and extremely tasty. Service was great also."}
{"text":"Service was great, the pizza was amazing!! The Uncle Louie was delicious and would recommend it! Butter cake is a must."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!  Love that we have a nice spot for a little date night or just a girls night! The pizza is delicious!  The Garlic knots are huge! And the desserts are yummmy!  Makes me go back for more!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my food. We ordered the original pizza along with the eggplant parmesan. The pizza was literally bread and sauce with little chunks of cheese. The eggplant was also very saucy. The marinara sauce that we had with our calamari was just liquid. It was terrible. On top of this the service was not good. They were not busy and the server took forever. I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"First time in the Chandler area in about 20 years. Very impressed with what they have done with the downtown area. Stumbled onto the Crust while we were wondering through the shops downtown ,sure glad we did. Was able to get in on a Saturday night with no wait. The wait staff here is excellent they go out of their way to make sure you are going to have a good time. Our brand of whiskey was not available at the bar, so  our waiter Shaun went out of his way to go downstairs and order it from the Speakeasy. The pizza reminded us of those that we were served in Rome it was  excellent. The Pappadel Bolenese had a good veal flavor and was something that I would  certainly order again. Overall our experience was excellent."}
{"text":"There are a lot of restaurants in downtown chandler to choose from, but Crust is a great choice! Luckily we got there early enough to beat the crowd because I can tell it gets busy. First let me tell you about the service. What a fun server we had. We sat near the bar and I wish I could remember his name but he was awesome! Answered all of our questions, made suggestions and jokes. Since it was our first time there the manager insisted in buying us desert. Unexpected and much appreciated. The food was   Quite tasty! We opted for pizza and tiramisu and enjoyed every bite.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The happy hour here is very good! I would not recommend the bruschetta it was diced tomatoes with Parmesan and nothing special at all. I really like the pizza. The cocktails are some of the best I've had and for that happy hour price can't beat it! We had several, the margarita, Moscow mile, and the rye whiskey one (can't remember the name). The house wine is also pretty delicious. Recommend the restaurant especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Dined there on a weeknight last week. My biggest pet peeve in a restaurant is poor timing for serving food. So, wouldn't you know it... My dinner came 2 bites into my salad. To me, there is absolutely no excuse for this. I wanted to send it back but felt it was safer in front of me just getting cold. Take my advice on this one, order 1 thing at a time. Last time I was there, I ordered the bruschetta and it looked great but just didn't compare to others I've had. I'll probably give them another try... Someday"}
{"text":"One of the first reviews I read here got it right: \"Terrible service and mediocre food combined for an overpriced experience!\" Actually, it was worse than that. The food made me feel queasy for hours. Here's a few service particulars: Waiter did not ask if we wanted water. Waiter was so busy when he brought out the calamari appetizer he put down two plates in front of my dinner guest instead of giving us each one. Their marinara sauce was overpowered by cayenne pepper, so everything they make is \"fra diavalo\" whether you like it that spicy or not. What's funny is the numerous waiters and waitresses they have running around...like a 1:1 ratio with customers but it doesn't help because none of them know what they're doing! Someone should tell the kindly grandmotherly woman running this place that she needs to hire real management to get this joke under control. Kind of sad, actually."}
{"text":"The best words I can come up with to describe are meal were \"average\" at best.  We split the fried cheese app and I felt like that came pre made and was just re heated with some sauce on top. I had a single slice pizza (which is nice that you can order ) but again nothing special here.  My husband had the chicken parm and it was over fried and bland.  Services was fine. Just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"My review is solely based on my initial experience and not the food. I didn't eat at this location. I stayed at the Crown Plaza and they are located next to the hotel. I decided to give them a try after looking at Yelp for choices. I walked in and was greeted in a fashion that I was not welcome. I asked for a to go menu and the guy handed me one and didn't say anything else. He went to a table with his laptop and 2 other guys walked in that he knew and  he jumped up like the place was on fire to greet them and talk with them. Bear in mind they walked in a couple of minutes after I did and I was still looking at the menu. A couple of more minutes go by and the clock is still ticking, no help, but the waitress went to the table the one guy (owner or mgr) was sitting at with the 2 guys and offered them drinks, food etc.,,,clock still ticking, after 9 1/2 minutes she comes to me and ask if she can help me with anything. NO THANK YOU! At this moment I was just gathering as much information I could to write my review hoping they would get on their game.   Additional cons: It was dark in the place and I had to use my phone to see the menu. Didn't offer me a drink, Was not friendly.   I decided to go across the street to La Stalla and it was a 180. La Stalla worked great for me but Crust didn't.   Your choice!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with the bar staff.  Not friendly whatsoever.  Came in with a few girlfriends for a birthday and you would have thought the bartender would have chatted with us or at least asked if we were out for an occasion.  They seemed more annoyed with us than anything even though they were not busy."}
{"text":"No value for what you spend.  You don't get what you get at other comparable restaurants.  Salad isn't included with your $17 dinner plate.  There is at least a $4 charge for something that comes with the meal @ every other Italian place I eat.  The food is good but they nickel & dime for everything.  Expecting some bread with your meal ?  DONT.  You get a dinner roll that is school cafeteria quality.  Sometimes it's warm.  Sometimes it's not.  No consistency."}
{"text":"Unique and delicious salads, great outside ambiance, and the BEST staff in Chandler! They always welcome my 2 Chihuahuas and I and give us the most hospitable service possible. After dinner, go downstairs to Ostrich for a cozy and romantic night cap in a Midwest \"sexy cavernous\" feel environment. My home away from home."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great atmosphere! And outstanding service! We sat at the bar and enjoyed dinner and cocktails. Brice was our bartender and he was super helpful as it was our first time.. will definitely return.  The girl who brought out our food, Kenzi, was super sweet as well! All over a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch because of a text offering free garlic knots for national garlic day. I mentioned the text offer and they were well aware of the offer but wouldn't honor without my phone, which I left in the car.  The waitress acted as if she would honor it and took my food order only to come back and state the manager said \"no\".  What a joke, they lost my business for life over terrible customer service. Go to Venezia's much better pizza and service!"}
{"text":"We are SO happy Crust came to DC! They just opened this week and appear to already be operating like a well-oiled machine. Food, service and atmosphere were outstanding! We all enjoyed watching the \"pizza man\" twirl and stretch the dough. This place is going to give La Stalla some stiff competition for business and if they keep it going, they will have many more loyal Crustomers :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Crust twice now and both times have been happy.  Their beer selection is good but not great.  They could certainly use a little more variety but they do offer several local selections.    As for the food I've only had two items.  The garlic knots which are good and the ever so amazing arugula and prosciutto pizza to which I add a side of burrata cheese.  Yes this pie is sublime.  Perhaps the best pizza I've had in a decade or so.  While pizza is such an individual preference this pie has a lot going for it that should make most happy.  First the ingredients are top notch.  The arugula is fresh and wonderful.  The prosciutto is not cooked with the pie leaving the flavor and texture intact.  The crust is firm, yeasty with just the right amount of salt.  The sauce is excellent and does not overwhelm the pie nor inject too much acid int the equation.  Yes my fellow Yelpers.... you must give this thing a try as it is a work of culinary art.    As for the location, parking is always a bit of a challenge.  Just dirt lot it and take a hike otherwise you will drive around like a jackass.  Note the back road behind Santan Brewery and this place is under construction making things even harder. if you know your way around.  The patio is pretty well set up and there is open air dining all around the place.  Great location for good weather dining.  Service is good but not great.  Our first experience was pretty slow despite it being relatively empty.  The second on the patio was better.  Looking forward to returning regardless and after a bit of tuning see this place as a 5 star contender."}
{"text":"I was quite interested in eating here, however was throughly disappointed. The appetizer that we got, which was the fried mozzarella, was quite good, and the calamari was mediocre, but it was downhill from there. I enquired about the Sicilian style pizza and was told it was just a breadier crust. I decided on getting then original pizza Sicilian style, which was described as having tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and evoo. Assuming that it was essentially a margherita pizza, which typically has little to no sauce, I was quite taken aback when I was served a sauce laden pizza. Trying to keep an open mind however, I tried it, but it was not very good. All I could fast was the pizza sauce and the burnt dough on the bottom of the crust. I could only eat one slice, as it was not good at all. Then my mother ordered the eggplant rollatini, which is typically just the stuffed eggplant. However she was essentially served an eggplant calzone, which is not at all what she wanted. My dad got the meatball sliders, which he had had before and loved, but they changed the meatball seasoning and he did not like it. So all three of us were displeased with our meals, and when the waitress came over and asked how things are, my non-confrontational mother responded \"the quality is good.\" While a true statement, I opened my mouth to add how we were displeased with our meals, but she walked away to box our food to go. I decided to take the food and planned on giving it to a homeless person on the street, as it was quite a bit of food, but when she came back I expressed our discontent. She asked if I wanted the manager and I said sure, but when the manager came she handled it quite poorly. We expressed our concerns and what we did not like; the main issue being the misleading menu. She took out a pad of paper and wrote down notes and walked away. Then came a man who said that the restaurant was \"certainly unorthodox\" and that he was responsible for the menu, so that it was his fault. He did not apologize for anything, and asked if we wanted some cannoli, which we did not. When he kindly declined, and started to ask to maybe try the butter cake that they had offered earlier, or to see what else could be done, he walked away and we were given the check. It was very poor customer service, as working in the food industry myself, this was not the way to handle dissatisfied customers. Both my mother and my meals were barely eaten, so it was not like we ate it and then complained. I also have felt nauseous since dinner and have a poor taste in my mouth. I do not recommend this restaurant at all, and only gave it one star due to the mozzarella appetizer, and due to the fact that I cannot give this restaurant 0 stars. It was not worth the price, was not good at all, the menu was misleading, and the customer service at the manager level was pathetic. Don't waste your money nor your time. On the bright side, I don't have an appetite after being there, so I don't have to worry about over eating tonight.   IMG_3186.JPG"}
{"text":"I tried this place expecting authentic Italian food but it was TERRIBLE. I'm a big fan of downtown chandler so I give all the new places a chance... but I will NEVER return.  It was loud,  service was terrible,  food was nothing special. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced. And do not get chicken.  Had to send it back.  Manager came out and told us they have been having issues with heir supplier and are trying to change suppliers.  Alfredo sauce is also very sweet which was a little unusual to me. Honestly Olive Garden is better and about a third of the price.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"Well, don't know about previous reviews, but service, food, and hospitality was A++++ for our group of 20+.  Meatball sliders, pizza, and cold beers - fast, tasty, and we never were waiting on anything.  Thanks Brandon for the tour downstairs - you are a passionate purveyor of good times, good food, and a true ambassador of Chandler."}
{"text":"Crust is my favorite Italian restaurant. I love their penne à la vodka and the Little Nicky pizza. I recently tried the garlic alfredo tortellini it had the perfect amount of sauce and it was delicious. The pasta dishes come with a roll that is light and fluffy similar to a croissant but not a croissant. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. Crust has a daily lunch special (except for weekends) The atmosphere is casual but not too casual. We have celebrated graduations and birthdays here. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews but ---   Hands down one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had at what's supposed to be a nice area in Chandler.  I'm staying at the Crown Plaza Resort and placed my order which was suppose to be delivered in 15 minutes. I waited an hour and called back.  Was told it was sitting there and he would \"bring it right up\". I asked him if it would be cold sitting there for 45 minutes and was told he'd \"warm it up\".  I waited another 25 minutes and called back to talk to manager. Jason apparently was the manager on and was very rude and short and pretty much hung up after I told him I wanted to cancel my order due to poor service. He never even apologized or asked to make it up.  Horrible service.   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great pizzas, good sangrias and the bar staff was really nice! The outside patio is nice but it's small, I wouldn't recommend it for a large group but it's a great happy hour spot!"}
{"text":"GREAT pizza. Probably the best I've had in a while. Beer selection isn't great, but what they have is good quality. Lots of wine and liquor selections."}
{"text":"You must experience Crust! Always a friendly greeting when you arrive, and prompt service. We often eat at the bar, and all of the bartenders are attentive and friendly, we especially enjoy aryan and Tatiana. Food is really fresh and flavorful, good potions, and priced right- and the Rustica pizza (individual) is huge and piled high with ingredients, easily shared with a top notch salad......sand then we go downstairs to the lounge...woo hoo!"}
{"text":"This place is SO GOOD. Delicious food, the garlic knots were incredible and the mozzarella encorroza was amazing. Also the employees were all super friendly! Would definitely recommend and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Lunch today was wonderful and not our 1st time at Crust but it was our 1st time getting the 20\" pizza and whoa...that's a pizza!! Took 1/2 home, which made another meal for dinner and a slice leftover for the morning...cold morning pizza = food of the Gods! We've been to Crust several times and consistency among food quality and staff is 100%!! Brian at the bar today was awesome as was, Javier (Mgr) and Heath too...all were so friendly and accommodating. Also, Tammy who works behind the scenes is very cool and she's very talented with her culinary experience. Cheers to Crust for keeping it a solid slice of yummy!!"}
{"text":"Maybe dinner time is better, with fresher ingredients but for lunch, salad served on past few occasions I dined here was terribly wilted and drenched in dressing to mask the un-freshness. I have been here on a couple of occasions and the pizza has been decent, when served whole, but lunch time slices are pretty pitiful. Overall, edible in a pinch, but would not go out of my way to dine here other than for the convenience of a lunch-time place near my office."}
{"text":"This place is just overall, AWESOME! Christina was our bartender tonight, and we were immediately,  wowed by her great and inviting demeanor! What a great first impression of your staff, as a whole! We ordered the Mediterranean Chicken and it  was one of the best entrées I've had since I moved here from New Jersey. This was our first time here and I plan on making it somewhere I frequent! Awesome job, Crust!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!   we had stromboli rollotini.  Could have shared one,  so big,  and so delicious"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Crust since they opened. I have always had a good experience from the food to the wait staff. Primarily we come for Happy Hour and enjoy the Rustica's, Calamari and the meatball sliders. They are all fabulous choices.  I have had the Kale salad as well and thought it was pretty tasty, did need extra dressing but perhaps that is just me. I have also enjoyed their current special on Sunday and Monday during Football season a Pizza to go for $10.00. Great value to take home and serve to family and friends. the atmosphere at Crust is also great, nice airy feel to the outside along with tables to sit out when the weather is cooler.  I have no complaints."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for dinner for the first time the place was very busy! My son and I ordered the garlic knots definitely recommend having them!!!  Since it was our first time here we asked our server Lisa what she recommended and she gave great recommendations on cocktails and dinner!! Both managers came over to our table and asked how our food and service was!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great.  Service very slow.  Food just ok.  If this place wants to make it DC they need to step it up a few notches.  They made a huge improvement since our first visit with decreasing the noise volume in the place.  Now they need to have better service and food"}
{"text":"If I could I could give 0 stars I would. So we show up around 5:30pm on a Monday. Place is pretty empty. Ordered drink which took about 30 mins to get. Ice was already melted in my drink. Ordered apps and meals. We did not get out food until 7:30. We waited a hour and a half for food @ a empty upscale pizza shop. BTW my pizza was cold. And there is some manager guy walking around looking busy but what a joke. Also I ordered a Calzone which was not a Calzone. Crust Chandler Simply Italian is a joke of a place and anyone that waste there money obviously does not care about the food they put in there mouth or any kind of service. What a rip off. Just remember every time someone has a bad experience they tell 10 people. I was with 4 people. That's 50 people in day. I think the major issue is the customer base has no clue what good Italian is. It sad that so many people accept this."}
{"text":"I love the food and the atmosphere here. Favorite pizza is the God Mother pizza. Add extra bacon to really make it delish. The 20\" is huge. Usually order it with intentions for leftovers. Downside is the service. Last couple times the staff has been super slow and it wasn't even packed. Other than that it's a favorite for me."}
{"text":"Wow!!! This place is a charmer. Cute atmosphere and friendly - great service. My husband had linguine with white wine  clam sauce  and I had Gluten Free Ravioli with Marinara Bouginese and both deserve aces!!!  I was not always gluten free so know what good pasta tastes like, after all I married an Italian. Being Gluten free makes eating good pasta challenging. This one wins 5 stars!! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So happy Chandler has a wood fired pizza place. The place it modern and trendy.  Drink prices are great with $5 wine until 6 pm and 1/2 price bottles of wine all day and night on Mondays. We had the garlic knots which were delicious! The Greek salad came out in a dough bowl which was a nice touch. The original rustic was good but could use big leafs of basil rather then a few tiny pieces. We were very happy with the service and will definitely be back, especially to check out the speakeasy down stairs."}
{"text":"One of the top 3 meals I've had in my 19 years in Arizona, and far and beyond the BEST Italian meals I've had anywhere. Chicken - Perfect. Pasta - Perfect. Sauce - Beyond Perfect. Service - Again, beyond. The elegant yet casual atmosphere is perfect for a date night, or for a family get-together. This was the first of hopefully many visits on my end. Management was humble and extremely appreciative. I now have a new go-to place in Downtown Chandler. AAAAA+++++"}
{"text":"I'm giving the three stars for the food! It is really good I think people who are rating the food as \"average\" are just so bitter about the staff experience. I liked the food. We came in 9 min before it opened (at 1:51) and the lady was rude and ignored us then said were not open. If I was a host I would have let them sit and offered waters for the mean time. We left to San tan across the street. They had such a good lunch deal and I was craving pizza so we came back. It was happy hour and lunch. The place was extremely quiet and almost awkward. You can tell the staff doesn't like working there. But we ordered the 5$ mozzarella and it was super good! Then got our slices of pizza and really good too. But service was mediocre and the bartender had a little attitude with our questions. I think the place needs to vamp itself up and turn the music a little louder to create a better environment and then the staff needs to be more friendly. So hopefully the owner reads this because this place has a lot of potential"}
{"text":"This is more a review to ownership to an experience that completely baffled me. Came here for dinner with 4 before a show. I recommended the space as I had experienced my best friend's rehearsal dinner at Crust a few months back with great praise.   Dinner was good. The pizza and pasta were tasteful and well portioned. Service was adequate and the experience was nice.... until...  When the bill came I inquired about a beer that was mispoured or was misrepresented incorrectly to ensure it was taken off the bill. It was stated (and I quote) \"oh, we do not do that here\". It was then suggested I speak to a manager and his response was (and I quote) we are pushing back on industry standards and have decided not to take items off of checks. We are supposed to investigate to see if it's a server's fault or if it's the customers inadequate knowledge of what is good.\"   Speechless. And as someone in the industry.... from an ownership standpoint. I left thinking. WOW. Someone may think what was said to me. But never could I imagine it would actually be vocalized to me like that.   And after having a 5 minute conversation with that manager... he stuck to his guns. And we did to ours. Good luck staying in business with that kind of attitude."}
{"text":"I went here for a friends bday and was very excited to try this place! Our service was unbelievably slow but figured, hey we have a big group it's okay! Unfortunately, the service didn't improve while we were there, which included my friend getting the wrong beer and waiting 20 minutes for ranch. That's all forgivable, but what really tainted my opinion was the pizza! I ordered the Chicken Pesto pizza.. What a mistake! The entire bottom of the crust was BURNT and the pizza was DRY! Even the chicken was over done. We had to put ranch on the pizza to make it bearable to eat. I consider pizza a treat and was very disappointed this was my treat. Very disappointing, especially for the price."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the look of the place and the staff is extremely nice and there for you. The pasta dishes we received were way off the mark. I was attempting to figure out what was weird about the dough . I tasted my son's cheese pizza sause, it was very bland and the dough wasn't fully cooked.  It was either missing an ingredient or someone not following the recipe.  We had muscles for an appetizer and they didn't seem fresh. Overall a very disappointed time because the food has to be awesome for that amount of money we spent. No mediocre food joint is going to survive at this location."}
{"text":"A mix of good things and bad things.  We had the \"Medium Crust\" Sicilian Style pizza.  It was huge, but the crust was very thick and oddly very light and fluffy.  Overall the taste was good, especially the sauce.  They put it on a little thin and next time I would order extra.  I did not like the Caprese salad which I found to be very bland, ever after adding additional balsamic vinegar.  The cookie ice cream thing was good except that the bottom cookie was a little burnt.  The restaurant is very dimly lit and we had to use our phone flashlights to read the menus.  I would not be opposed to going again, but it will not be my first pick."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite pizza places in Arizona. Whenever I am in Chandler we order from this place."}
{"text":"\"Simply Italian\" and \"Pizza Rustica\" are some terms you will hear when coming to Crust. Rustica is a term used for the leftover dough scraps from bread that are pieced together to form the pizza dough. The odd shaped pizza is then topped with simple ingredients. I've been to this location (downtown Chandler) twice. The first time I got their side of meatballs and the Arugula and Prosciutto Rustica. The pizza was good and the service wasn't bad. But the second time I had both excellent service and the pasta was outstanding. I ordered the rigatoni sausage and enjoyed every bite. My server was Jiana and she was top notch. I was very impressed with how welcoming and attentive she was. Both times I was here for lunch so I haven't experienced what the dinner crowd is like. They sell a marinara sauce that you can take home that benefits Kurt Warner's foundation. They also have a some good happy hour specials."}
{"text":"We visited Crust for the first time with a group of friends to celebrate my wife's birthday. I wanted to love Crust for so many reasons and unfortunately I left feeling very disappointed. Service was slow, drinks took forever, gluten free bruschetta was bland, my pizza was raw, and my wife's meal was forgotten about. On a positive note, they comped her pizza and our server was very sweet. Hopefully Crust can pull it together, clearly there is a lack of leadership here."}
{"text":"I did have a higher review in the past for Crust, but after dining last week and asking for ranch dressing with my fried zucchini and I was given TWO tiny cups and charged .50 for each without the server advising me of this charge, I have lowered my review. Never before have I been charged for a side of dressing. That seems very sneaky"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food.. We will be back for sure!! Monday's you can get half of bottles of wine :)"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed by this place. We went last night (Saturday) and didn't have a great experience. The atmosphere was nice, but it was way too loud. They have a concrete ceiling with almost no sound proofing, so it became louder and louder as the night went on. The restaurant didn't staff appropriately, so the service was average (to say the least). We had a few good meals, but the Penne Ala Vodka was undercooked and bland, a the Panchetta Tortalinni was just poorly done. The sauce was thick, but not rich, and generally average. If a place like that executes well, it would be well worth the money, but unfortunately, they just haven't figured it out yet. I won't be going again until the reviews here get much better."}
{"text":"Party of 4 on an early Saturday night.   We love the choices downtown Chandler and decided to try the Crust as a new option but found it average at best.  We shared an appetizer that was good and each had pasta.  Large portions but quality of food no better then a franchise restaurant.  It was dissapointing they do not make any of their pasta fresh.  I loved the décor of the restaurant and they had outside dining with misters for hotter nights.   Noise level pretty high which was fine unless it was a first date or romantic dinner.   The restaurant was not full yet the tables especiall the 4 tops in the middle were really crammed together practically touching.   Our server was pretty attentive but meal service was slow.  They are in such a great location that it was a shame the quality of the food was just average as there are just too many other places to go that we will not try the Crust again."}
{"text":"We ordered a rustica NY pizza, side Caesar salad and the lemon chicken plate.   On the pizza, the crust and cheese had very little flavor and the sauce was bitter. It could be that they make the sauce with heirloom tomatoes, which he doesn't prefer.   The Caesar salad was good but there's a lot of sauce and cheese so you may want to get it on the side if you're a calorie/fat watcher.  The lemon chicken was good, but not great. I would give it a 3/5. My husband gave his a 1/5, this the 2/5 overall.    Our server was friendly and helpful. Side note- they have a very flavorful iced tea that is both fruity and floral. If your a fan of these types of tea, you might want to give it a try."}
{"text":"I'm in Paradise, my fave Pizza of all time in Chandler, made in on Opening Day, got my Margarita Pizza, They know Pizza inside out ."}
{"text":"So, I was excited to try this place since so many people like it. It's really cool inside with a mid century/industrial feel. The lights above the tables are super low and annoying since they came right at eye level. Place was loud so it's hard to talk to people at your table and see them with those damn lights. I was really really hoping this would be good Italian food but it just wasn't, especially for the price. One of us got the fettucini alfredo and it  was gooey with overcooked pasta. My tortellini pesto was so RIDICULOUS! It had so much damn sauce that I could barely see th pasta. It was literally swimming in it. I'm not hard to please but I couldn't even finish it. I'm not sure why they thought that was okay. When I told the server about it she just asked if I wanted it boxed up. I would have preferred a refund but she wasn't having it. Such a waste of money. You might get better Italian food from a frozen dinner."}
{"text":"YUUUMMMMMM!!! My husband and I went here tonight.  We sat outside, the evening was very nice.  We shared a meal.   The crust salad, greens and spinich, tomatoes, cucumber and black olive.  With a light tastey vinigrett.  We then had the liquini with clam sauce, white sauce.  Not too much wine, not too much garlic, not too many clams or too few clams, perfectly well balanced and delicouse."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times with my daughter and it's always nice  but today was exceptional! I believe our servers name was Noland and the gentleman who sat us was Sean. They were both AMAZING! Sean opened the door for us (I was carrying my baby) and sat us took our drink orders right away. Noland was kid friendly and his customer service was exceptional! I asked for a fun kid friendly drink they had regular lemonade which I guess I seemed less than excited about, he made us strawberry lemonade and my daughter LOVED it  he also made great recommendations on apps, food, and desert. All were amazing! Thank you for making our mommy daughter dinner date awesome we will be back for sure xoxo"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good service was horrible there's a lot of us here though it took forever to get our bill straightened out. The waiter was absent a lot... drinks were very slow in coming all night..."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurants. We ordered pizza , salad and a sandwich. After over 45 minutes of patiently waiting and no comment from server in what the delay was, we asked the manger about our food. He said he was too busy to help us. He said he would be with us in 10-15 minutes. If we didn't want to wait, we were more than welcome to leave. Who treats customers like that? I told the server we were leaving and left cash for the drinks. She just shrugged her shoulders and said \"do what you have to\". I don't think I gave been treated so poorly as a paying customer in my life. The management is an embarrassment and service, all around was horrendous. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Edit after returning in November - our second trip to Crust was much better than the first. Our waiter was great and very helpful (although a little absent toward the end of our meal), and this time we tried the Little John pizza. Definitely more my style pizza with the cheese (although not sure if I'd consider what we got as \"extra\"), and the toppings were really great. Next time though, I think we will try the same kind of pizza on the thicker crust, just because it is a lot of toppings and the thin crust doesn't always hold it well (which we knew beforehand thanks to the waiter). Great wine selection as before. Appreciate the manager contacting us to make things right.   First review - I was underwhelmed by this place. Got the Uncle Louie individual pizza and heart healthy rollatini. The pizza was okay, when you actually got all of the ingredients in a bite. Most of it was just crust and sauce, cheese was not spread out to my preferred liking (I realize that's how mozzarella is and how some people like it, just not for me). There wasn't much flavor to it either, and the crust was crispy on the edges but soggy in the center. The rollatini was similar with the dough, soggy on the bottom. Taste wasn't anything impressive.  They had a good drink selection, which I liked, and out waiter was great, when he actually came around; I had to go find him a few times.  I'd skip it unless it's for their happy hour drinks, hopefully their appetizers are better than their pizza..."}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  Table for ten Saturday nite (Dec 16) and was looking forward to the Bolognese sauce with my pasta.  I dined at Crust last spring and it was the best!!  Silky smooth and had obviously been simmered for hours!  This time?  Just a lot of big chunks of meat/hamburger in a regular sauce.  Did recipes change?  Change of cooks?  Tasted like 10 minute spaghetti...brown the ground beef, add pasta sauce, simmer until hot and pour over pasta.  On the positive side, the service was better than 5 stars.  Attentive and very polite!  I will most definitely return because I've tasted how good it can be and hoping they get back to that fabulous Bolognese!"}
{"text":"Came here a month ago with some friends. The food was good and so was the service. It was a busy night and we had our little one who was some what misbehaving but the waiters and staff were cool. Will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Have been here multiple times!! Love it each time, great food, great atmosphere and good service! Come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Good menu, though an it limited.  Location is open, a bit small and loud so plan for a family night but not a first date.  A good casual Italian location that chandler needed."}
{"text":"Good food, atmosphere, and friendly staff.  Good to have this place within walking distance from home!"}
{"text":"I wanted a wine cream garlic sauce and they were more than happy to make that accommodation for me. It was amazing. Michael my server was very attentive, Tammy the chef has culinary skills and did an amazing job at the sauce on my shrimp scampi. Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Going the extra mile for my wife's Bday and covering dessert. Along with great food at an affordable price. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I had written a previous review that wasn't quite so favorable. The amazing team there more than made it right, and I've been back numerous times since and have received excellent service, fabulous food and great atmosphere. I highly recommend Crust!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place with a nice outside bar on a Saturday afternoon. Crust........you have been chosen.  Loved the witty bar staff from the second we sat down. Pizza was outstanding. My wife said she was only going to have one piece, and she ended up eating about 1/2 of it. Guess what, I'm still hungry. Meatball sliders.....THE BOMB, she 1/2 of those too. Im not a big marinara sauce guy, it gives me heartburn........but this was the best sauce I've ever had....Kudos Kurt Warner.   We liked this place.....alot. We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Update: after this review, Kristina wrote me a private message via Yelp, \"bahaha!!!\" Her manager asked for a screenshot, which I sent. Never heard back from him. Professional.  -------------  Awful, awful food...what's worse, is the service. Thanks Kristina! Bless her heart, but man is she a b*tch. Stay away at all cost!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I have been to Crust multiple times. (Scottsdale and Chandler) Service is always awesome! Never, ever, had a bad experience. Managers and/or owner always stop by to check on us. The food is ALWAYS delicious. How stylist, never had a bad meal. Consistency is key! And we have even had managers bring by food we didn't order so we could try it. (Kitchen mistakes) tonight we ordered just a caprese salad and cheese NY style pizza. So friggin good. AND HALF ORICE BOTTLES OF WINE (Mondays). Yes, you read that correctly... The manager tonight was Nick and he gave us a chilled or room temp option for our red wine, which was awesome because I'm a weirdo and like my red wine chilled. There are a couple of really ridiculous reviews on here.. As with any Yelp account, make sure you read what the customers write and the reasoning for giving less than stellar reviews. Don't pass this place up! And if there's a problem, let someone know so they can fix it! Problem solved!"}
{"text":"This is the worst dining experience I've had in a while.  First was the sour wine, which I sent back, politely asking the server what she thought.  I had already detected a slight attitude from her (which would carry through our whole experience), but was offended when she took the glass of wine back to the bar where I could hear her telling the two other ladies behind the bar that I thought the wine was \"off\" and then they all laughed.  Not once did any of them smell or taste the wine.  She came back and defensively said that the bartender had \"just opened that bottle\" and I was offered a replacement glass of a different brand.  Well yeah, you just opened the bottle and it is spoiled, right?  Whatever, I ordered a different brand.  That one was also vinegary, but I sucked it up and drank it.  My friend was watching the bartender and saw her take the glass of wine that I had sipped from and returned and pour it back into a mini-carafe, presumably to be served to another unsuspecting customer, along with the rest of the spoiled bottle being served to other unsuspecting customers.  I powered through the second glass of vinegar, I mean wine, while we were waiting for our bruschetta.  On our Bruschetta plate we ordered Classic, Goat Cheese & Roasted Garlic, Artichoke & Mushroom, and Apple & Fig:  None were that great, due to lackluster bread.  This is not what i consider a good use of my limited carb intake.  Classic - not much flavor and the tomatoes were so cold (refrigerated) to be off putting.  Goat Cheese & Garlic - one of the best of the four.  Still not that exciting due to the boring bread.  Artichoke & Mushroom - again, the toppings were too cold.  The artichoke was stringy and tough.  Apple & Fig - the other tie for best of the four, but still not good enough to go back.  There is better elsewhere.  I then ordered To Go for my boyfriend and I (I know, why?? - so that I didn't have to cook when I got home).  The To Go took a long time, even though they weren't that busy.  The entrees came out first and the appetizer (free Garlic Knots that I got through their SMS program) came out about 5-10 minutes later.  We finished our wine and left.  My review of the To Go:  Stromboli - once again, the bread wasn't very good.  Tasteless and chewy.  The fillings did little to save the lack of bread quality.  Bummer.  Mac & Cheese - I ordered the Mac & Cheese with Jalapeños and Bacon on my friend's recommendation, but apparently our server wasn't listening and I just got straight Mac & Cheese.  No flavor.  Not a bit.  Just pasta and cream.  Meh.  Garlic Knots - oh yeah, those garlic knots that held up the entire order.  Every one of them was burnt on at least one side.  And I didn't taste any garlic.  Just bland burnt bread.  Yea.  I can not recommend Crust in Chandler.  Even if I had ordered other choices that had made up for the lack of quality and flavor in the food (not to mention the horrible wine), the service had a feeling of being forced and full of attitude.  I saw forced, fake smiles on most of the servers' and bartenders' faces.  I don't know if their other locations are better, but Chandler is a fail."}
{"text":"Hell yes! Gotta wait by the door to be seated, you wont be served if you just walk in and sit down. Service was a little weird, our waiter seemed new or something but did a good job overall. The pizza was delicious, and quite big for the price. Great for the money! Atmosphere is nice -lights are dim, giving it an almost candlelight ambiance. As for pizzas being \"Phallic\" as other reviewers have said, how do you expect to have a perfectly conical SINGLE SLICE of dough? It doesn't work that way. Get your heads outta the gutter and enjoy the delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza cold all toppings fell of and salad came with a breadstick bowl. Not a good take out place"}
{"text":"From start to finish, every bite was delicious and my only qualm is that I didn't have enough room for dessert! Next time for sure; )  All in all my overall experience was good. Love the atmosphere with a beautiful view of the historic San Marcos courtyard. Was not the most impressed with the customer service but our waiter was pleasant. I believe you should make sparkling eye contact with everyone in the room accompanied by a grateful you are here smile but what do I know! Will be back for the food!!: )"}
{"text":"OBSESSED with the Eggplant Rollatini!   After trying this place out shortly after it opened, I have been back several times. Truth be told I haven't tried anything but the Eggplant Rollatini, but it's so good it doesn't matter.   I've tried both the spinach dip and the crispy mozzarella for appetizers. The spinach dip was a great although it had a little too much cheese for my liking (I recognize that's not a problem to anyone else.) The crispy is absolutely delicious!   Back to the Eggplant Rollatini. SO GOOD. Order it \"appetizer style\" and they cut it before cooking it so it comes out extra crispy and delicious. I love this dish so much I've been guilty of ordering one to eat for dinner and one to take home.   They also have a solid cocktail list. I loved my Moscow Mule.   My only complaint about this place is that they tried to cram WAY too many tables into a teeny tiny little space. Every time I've been in there I've been bumped into several times, had my purse knocked off my chair, and had my foot stepped on. It doesn't bother me much, as I'm young and am used to being bumped into at bars and clubs, but I have seen other customers complain about it before. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  HUGE portions (we have enough in boxes for several more meals). $5 before 5 wine (even on a Saturday).  Nice spot for a very casual Saturday lunch.  TVs showcasing the Olympics.  We will put this on our family eat out rotation."}
{"text":"Came here to quickly grab a slice for myself and my daughter. Sat at the outside bar for a bit, noticed the poor bartender was running his ass off so I went inside to find a host/ess. Nope. This poor kid was working the ENTIRE place by himself. Meaning taking guests on patio, bar and interior tables. THIS KID ROCKS. Give this kid a raise ! (I know managers read yelp) The interior is rustic and typical downtown chandler. The pizza for this Jersey girl was just \"eh\". A little on the doughy side, could have been cooked more. Sauce had flavor and cheese was fresh. I wish that I had more time to really look over the menu. Pizza was good enough to make me want to discover more items on their menu.  Let's hope when I return there are more people working"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has 3.5 stars.  The food is very good, the service is excellent.  Excellent lunch specials.  The Sicilian Pizza was so good.  Not too thick, it was like biting into a pastry.  The Mozzarella en Carozza is one of the best I've ever had.   2nd to only 1 other restaurant.  The Red Sangria is delicious.  They have a great outdoor patio and the location you cannot beat...downtown Chander.  So fun!"}
{"text":"I am happy that Crust has opened a location in Chandler.  The Downtown Chandler scene just keeps getting better and better and Crust is just another reason why.  The restaurant is cute and inviting with an eclectic decor theme and the patio is nice for cool days/nights.  The staff is very friendly and help with suggestions.  The food is very good although they really love to use lots of garlic (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, you just have to like Garlic).  I've eaten here twice now and both times I have enjoyed my meals.  The portions are large and can definitely be shared or brought home.  The chicken Parm is tasty and one of the larger dishes.  I've also had the linguine with Clams and that was very tasty as well.  Drink selection is good and definitely try to Cucumber Collins.  It is delicious!"}
{"text":"Took the family out to dinner tonight (Christmas). We we greeted and seated right away. Our waitress was great. Offered us drinks and was quick to return then asked for our appetizer order. We enjoyed the bruschetta board. All flavors were great especially the sweet potato one. (They were all pretty awesome.)  I was impressed with service.  At one point we moved ourselves to another table since we were right in front of the door. With patrons coming and going it was COLD!  Our hostess nodded and smiled as we jumped tables. :)  our check game quickly and leftovers packed up tight. Kudos to our server!   The view to the patio was nice and relaxing. It was all decked out for the holiday. Really pretty.   My husband loved his sweet potato gnocchi. He ate it all up!  My son order the Little John Pizza and as others have said, it definitely had an odd shape. We thought it was a mistake or a joke, but nope, it was definitely shaped like a body part. My son said it was good but the crust got soggy in the middle. He ate all of his except for a small piece, so I guess he liked it.   I wasn't in love with mine. I ordered the chicken Marsala. So much food and a ton of pasta. It just didn't have enough flavor for me and it was a bit too oily for my palate.   Noise level was ok at the time we were there and it was getting full by 6 pm.  Good for families and all ages. I liked that aspect very much.   I loved the bar set up and could see myself dropping in for a drink and bruschetta board at the bar, but probably wouldn't eat a full on meal."}
{"text":"Had such a good dinner with my friend here on Saturday! The bartenders were super nice and very attentive. (Teddy and Nate) Their service was great! The food was pretty good! But their white sangria was amazing!!! Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the server was very friendly and personable. We shared some salads and their wonderful Rustica styled personal pizzas. The sausage had a nice little zesty kick to it. Me and my 2 friends had a wonderful time on their patio."}
{"text":"Crust  restaurant in Chandler is awesome   Aaron is an excellent server and the food is excellent. We had tortellini ala Pamona and The God Mother Pizza, both outstanding"}
{"text":"Awesome, casual restaurant with great prices! I have been to crest in Chandler probably a dozen times. I have never ordered anything I regret it! The food is awesome the Rustica Pizza is to die for! Wine $5 per glass every day until 5! If you haven't been make it a priority!"}
{"text":"Nasty food.  I had the tortellini alla panna It should not have onions and peas. Nasty.  And the prosciutto was in chunks.  My spouse's penne pasta was tough.  Olive Garden is better."}
{"text":"Good location, The garage door patio bar Will be nice once the weather cools off.  Place was quite warm.  Meat and cheese board was, three pieces of bread not quite enough. Sicilian pizza was thick and cooked in timely manner unfortunately it was oversauced.  Not quite sure if her return."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, try the pesto pasta with the Italian sausage. Kids menu is a bit limited, we ended up ordering a small pizza for the kid and taking home left overs."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Crust and we can't wait to go back!  Great patio and atmosphere with awesome service and drool worthy food.  Definitely recommend the Calamari and any one of the Rustica pizzas."}
{"text":"The wife and I dropped in on this place for happy hour on a Saturday evening.  The ambiance and patio are incredible and make this place worth a stop on it's own.  We had a few glasses of wine which were reasonably priced and a bruschetta appetizer which was good, not great.   I'd consider going back for sure but there is also a lot of competition on this stretch in Chandler.  Definitely worth dropping in for a glass of wine at sunset."}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food combined for an overpriced experience!   My husband, daughter, and myself entered the door and stood around confused for a minute waiting for someone to greet us and looking for a hostess stand before we finally seated ourselves. Over the next five minutes we sat at the table without menus and drinks only to have three different people pass us and ask \"have you been helped?\" and when we said no they said okay and left and didn't help us. I had to specifically request menus to get them. Eventually someone volunteered herself \"Well I guess I can take you\" with a shrug and our order was placed. We got artichoke dip and a Hawaiian Sicilian pizza. The dip came with blackened burnt crostinis (I very much wondered how these got past any type of inspection and onto our plate) and stale chips. I was hungry enough to eat the chips and dip to sate my appetite as I waited for what I hoped would be a delicious pizza. One part of my expectation was correct: I certainly got to wait.. and wait and wait!  Our drinks were empty,  our appetizer plates were neatly stacked and waiting to be taken away, and we just waited, waitress nowhere to be seen. Eventually she made a reappearance when she brought our pizza. I had to specifically ask her to refill our waters which she did, dropped off, and ran away so quickly I had zero chance to ask for napkins or anything else.  Our pizza was undercooked and the toppings were ice cold as if they had been taken out of the fridge, chopped and placed on top after the pizza went through the oven. It was quite perplexing. I would've loved the chance to tell our waitress and to have our pizza more cooked but she of course had made another mysterious disappearance. After 15 minutes of waiting with empty glasses, stacked plates (yet again), and our credit card on the edge of the table someone finally acknowledged our existence and offered us a box. I told him our pizza had arrived cold, our server hadn't been back, and begged him to check us out. No apology was offered, just a confused \"oh\" when he tried to walk away and get a box and I said \"No please, take the credit card with you, we are done.\"  Our pizza was taken off the bill but we were still given the pleasure of paying for our dip and drinks. Had the entire bill been comped with an apology I would consider returning here. As is, we will take our business elsewhere and put \"Crust\" on the \"not worth it\" list. There are plenty of other restaurants in Chandler/Gilbert with exponentially better service, food, and prices."}
{"text":"This place needs a work over and upgrade of food and service. It's great location is not enough. Good happy hour prices on drinks and food. Dinner entrees and service is another story. I would like to see this restaurant become a better Italian restaurant and improve the dishes they already have. Service is a little bit surly. Especially the bartenders."}
{"text":"Just a wonderful Sunday afternoon meal! We were greeted warmly by most all the staff upon entering - service by Ian was perfect down to recommending wine & dishes. We had the artichoke w/burrata cheese which was excellent- spinach & tuscan salads fresh & well dressed, & penne vodka pasta & steak sandwich - wines were good especially for the $5 price.  We've eaten most everywhere else in that part of town & will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I went into crust last night during the Christmas tree lighting for the first time. Packed when I walked in , no room at the bar or anything. I was immediately greeted by the hostesses. There was a wait but they accommodated me as soon as they could. I was even lucky to get a patio table.  Kudos to the hostesses and manager that helped clean our table faster so my grandma could sit down.  I'll definitely be returning to Crust!"}
{"text":"This last time was a bit of a let down. The tortellini was way over cooked and the pesto sauce had no flavor at all..."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly people. I love the gluten free pizza . I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"While it can be hit or miss I have had far more good experiences here than poor. Great beer selection and a wide range of Italian options. Check it out"}
{"text":"This is a hard review for me because I used to love going to Crust for lunch every week or so, but the quality has gone down so far that I won't be back for a long time.  My concerns started about a year and a half ago when they began to make the lunch pizza slices in the morning, freeze them, and then heat them up when ordered.  Perhaps they did that prior, but the taste was declining so much that one day I asked the bartender about it and was told about the freezing process, so I stopped wasting my money on slices for lunch.  Since then I've still gone back for other lunch items but it can be very hit or miss... there is just no consistency from one day to the next.  The only item worth ordering is the regular NY style pizza, which is still great.  The same goes for the service, one day it's amazing and the next day it's just horrible.  My last visit was for a business lunch, and the service was decent, but 2 of the 4 dishes (including my chicken parm) were inedible.  Seriously, I have never had a worse piece of chicken in my life; I can't even explain it.  It was like cutting through crunchy plastic, and to make matters worse the breadcrumbs were mostly burnt and the entire dish smelled funny, like what a petting zoo smells like.  I truly hope they improve the quality back to what I remember, but honestly most of the time when a business starts going downhill and cutting corners on the quality of food, it doesn't recover.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Hello, My friend ordered Mac and Cheese for dinner Saturday night and it was runny and tasted like Kraft Mac and Cheese.    I have had several experiences where the food has not been good which I am surprised because when the restaurant first opened the Pizza was great and not burned and the service was much better."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! I got taken out here finally and super happy I got to go! The services was really good and they have a great happy hour and the food was delicious! If you order a lot of veggies the crust will get soggy, our fault! Try this place out if you're in chandler! Awesome decor as well ugh so in love"}
{"text":"I had the strawberry salad , it come in a pizza dough bowl. Really nice. Wide selection of music play, staff are friendly and helpful. The is a bar located downstairs I'll have to come back to see that."}
{"text":"Had dinner before a concert   Service was slow and inattentive. Pizza was mediocre. Pasta was very good. Ordering a few beers from the bar seemed to take forever. One person ordered a kolsh and it didn't taste right. Told the server we didn't want it. The bill cake and we asked if he took off the beer which was completely full. He said that's not the policy. Requested a manager who said the most interesting thing. He actually told us that at crust, they push back on industry standard and don't give the customer everything they want. Interesting concept. I have a voice as well and have a standard. Dint really patronize places that don't make the customer number one."}
{"text":"I hated the pizza, but the lasagna is AMAZING.  WOW, they make great red sauce.  I enjoyed the garlic knots, too.  The meat balls and sausage are really good too.  I like the atmosphere and we had great service."}
{"text":"We went for lunch after they had only been open for a week.  Nice decor, friendly staff, good menu.  Service was a little spotty.  Had a party of 6 and we all ordered either wine or beer.  It took forever to get our drinks.  I saw them sitting on the bar for a good while before we finally asked someone (who wasn't our server) to go get them.  The greek salad was small for the price and compared to salads I order at other Italian/pizza places.  White pizza was really good.  We ordered it with the addition of tomatoes and pesto drizzle.  The pesto drizzle made it a little too oily for my taste, but it was really good.  Looking forward to trying it out again."}
{"text":"Stopped down on their second day open. Courteous, accommodating staff greeted us promptly before grabbing a seat. Watching the pizza chef and bartender was a treat - both took a lot of pride in their craft. Meatball sliders were amazing with lots of flavor. Pizza crust was delicate with a crispy crust that ends with a chewy tear of the teeth combining for a rustic synergy of goodness. Pasta was a delightful bite of al dente coupled with well seasoned shrimp. Great addition to DC Chandler!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time this past Tuesday 8/18/15. Had never been to the other locations. First of all, the decor is very aesthetically pleasing (it's beautiful inside) or waitress Alexis was super attentive and informative. We had the little Jon 20 inch thin crust pizza  (there was only 2 of us) they gave us half the pizza and kept the other half warm in the back (amazing!) We also split the spinach salad, the raspberry vinegarette(sp?) Was amazing,  I usually hate the sweet dressing, but this was so wonderfully balanced I loved it. Great addition to downtown!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate! The food was really amazing! Like I said earlier we had my bachelorette party downstairs here and everything was really great! So we thought we would come back on a beautiful Thursday afternoon! The bar was kind of dead. The service was absolutely awful! Bow and Nathan were the bartenders my girlfriend and I sat there for a very long time without acknowledgement, asked if we want to drink, asked if we wanted a menu, no acknowledgement whatsoever! I stayed meeting with another friend they're the same day and the service was just ridiculous! They were more interested in talking to management at the end of the bar then taking care of their customers. Super disappointing. management should have been the first to inform their employees to take care of their customers unfortunately that was not the case!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere inside!  The brick oven pizza is fabulous.  Great happy hour with $5 wine and must try the meatball sliders. Can't wait to go back and try some entrees. Great addition to Downtown Chandler."}
{"text":"Signed up for text alert deals.  We received one today for BOGO lunch sandwiches or entrees. We arrived but nobody greeted us when we entered. We waited a moment then seated ourselves.  Took more than a few minutes to get greeted and then more for drinks.   I had the penne vodka and he had the steak sandwich. Good but not great.   I may come back again for a 2nd shot but not sure......"}
{"text":"Went here for Father's Day and loved the food. The bruschetta is awesome and several different kinds to select from. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I was in town, visiting my new grand niece. My friend and I decided to walk around downtown Chandler and stumbled across this restaurant. It was poppin'! The ambiance was great. There were lots of people. And, you could eat inside or people watch and eat outside. Even though the atmosphere was great; we had we had NO idea if the food was any good.   Then, the appetizer showed up. OMG!!! Their food is AMAZING. You MUST try their Spicy Garlic Knots. They are to die for! It's on the menu as an appetizer, but they are big enough and filling enough to be a meal. I also had the Italian Chopped Salad. It was very fresh. The portion size was so big that I was able to eat the other half for lunch, the next day. Lastly, their cocktails are great and they have happy hour! Go! You won't be sorry. And, I will not hesitate to go back the next time I am in town.  Bravo Crust!!"}
{"text":"Very delicious with enormous portions. We started with the bruschetta board (8 large pieces if your choosing). Both husband and I did choose our own pasta. Both were tasty, but we didnt have a way to take and reheat leftovers which would be at least 2 days of lunches each. Go hungry or split a pasta dish. We also enjoyed sitting out on the patio with our toddler."}
{"text":"I have had pizza all over the  Phoenix and especially the East Valley. I think this place has one of the best pizzas around.  I have been here many times. The service is sometimes hit and miss.  Commonly, I will go to the bar to have drinks and dinner. I have never been disappointed by the food."}
{"text":"I tried this place while staying at the Crowne Plaza. My husband was away so it was just my infant and I. I was told that there was a 20 minute wait however there were many tables available. I gave my name and went next door to wait. I was called in about 20 minutes. I waited another 10 to see my server, she was pleasant. I ordered a pizza and a glass of Chianti. The pizza took a very long time but it was very tasty. The sauce and the cheese were nice and fresh. I would give this place another try. Hopefully the next time I wouldn't have to wait forever and a day for 1 pizza"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!!. In Chandler for business. Walked the 'main drag'. Went with the restaurant that actually had folks in it. Not a bad theory. Glad we did. From start to finish, everything was outstanding. Tastes were fresh, lively, spicy, layered with authentic Italian senses. Great complimenting wine list. If you are in town it's a must amongst the many possibles. Appetisers were on point. Salads were delicious and big. We (2 of us) had Veal Parmesan. Scampi Diavolo and the Lasagna. We finished every bit. Delicious. Good tasting desserts. Of course Italian not complete without espresso and Sambuca. Prices fair. Service outstanding. One comment to the restaurant. Add a non alcoholic beer, for those who want to join in, and still feel apart of the fun!!!! Thanks."}
{"text":"Crust is my happy place for Happy Hour.  At the end of downtown Chandler, it is busy but not crazy.  The perfect place to enjoy delicious flat crust pizza and a glass of wine with great prices.  The front of Crust is all windows so can watch all the activity going on outside.  But, the inside is warm and cozy and the staff is always knowledge and nice.  My favorite pizza is the Original Rustica.  It is simple and the crust never gets soggy.  They also have a great wine list.  If you want to keep the night going, head downstairs to the Ostrich.  It sits underneath Crust.  The Ostrich has a great ambiance and feels like a Speakeasy."}
{"text":"Crust is our go to spot anytime we are in downtown Chandler. The rustica pizzas are a must! Cold drinks and great service too! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We went to dinner on a Sunday night. After we were sat, we waited 10 minutes for someone to come greet us and take our order. After we ordered, we sat for 25 minutes waiting for our dinner. The waiter came back and said there was a mistake with our meal and it would be out shortly. The service was horrible. No one came to fill our drinks, clear are plates or offer us anything while we waited.  Very disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"Ordered tortellini Alla panna via GrubHub... Definitely didn't get any tortellini... Dish was pretty good but I would've ordered something else had I known I wouldn't get tortellini to be honest."}
{"text":"Wow what a wonderful atmosphere for a date night. We got a traditional pizza half the supreme and half the jack. It was a mouthful, we didn't finish the pizza and we split it amongst 4 people. Also the cannolis are fabulous."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place given the perfect location. I should have known not to bother since this place was completely empty and San tan brewery had a line out the door! We walked in on a Sunday at 4 pm. Again, no one in the restaurant dinning . We were greeted by a waiter that told us to go ahead and sit wherever . Ok. I grabbed a menu and we sat down. Was eventually greeted by a server who took our order and got us our water . We both ordered a pizza . No plates were ever offered or given , refills non existent, she didn't wake up and attempt any sort of service until it was time for the check . Yeah thanks! Pizza was cold and tasteless ,service and atmosphere was on par with the food. Too bad because the location is amazing, and I love to support local businesses."}
{"text":"The food was ok, a little overpriced. service was good. They advertise happy hour come to find out it wasn't the day we were there. If I could make a suggestion it would be to advertise the specials for the day it is.... why would I care about the specials for next week..?  Also the place is pretty crowded. Maybe a few less tables inside. If you go you'll see what I'm talking about. I'll probably pick another place next time."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  I could've eaten the the garlic knots just by itself.  I ordered the 20 inch pizza for my wife and i. The pizza was really good and we ended up taking a lot home.  Highly recvomend."}
{"text":"Our family came in here on a wed. Night for dinner. First time of course and we will def. be coming back. The wine we had,Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio was Delish. Smooth and tasty. The apps, bruschetta 4 styles were very great and the chicken parm ,rustic pesto chicken pizza and macn cheese were all very good. The service was excellent as well. Loved this place. The only thing I would change is its a bit dark and the fans above make it a bit chilly."}
{"text":"This place has the most outstanding gluten-free crust I have ever had! I had them cook me  pizza well done.  It came out so crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.   It's like eating a French baguette. I'm in heaven!"}
{"text":"Kristina did message me and apologize and stated that she was not the manager on duty that night and will look into the issue more."}
{"text":"The short version:  The Food: YUM The Service: Needs help  I've been here twice in the past couple months and both times it was... Well... Definitely less than perfect.  The first time was for a friend's birthday dinner. She made a reservation weeks in advance because she knew it would be a large group - around 20 people. She arrived on the night of her birthday only to be told that they \"lost her reservation\" due to some kind of technical issue? And there was nowhere to seat her large party. So they pulled together a bunch of tables downstairs in the attached \"speak-easy\", The Ostrich, and we attempted to celebrate her birthday in the pitch dark, yelling at each other over the loud music.  I was back again last week for a dinner outing with friends. I had signed up for their loyalty program/text club earlier that day since their website advertised signing up would earn me a free order of garlic knots. After signing up, I did promptly receive a text confirming the free order. After arriving and ordering our drinks, I showed the text to our server to claim them. The server abruptly stated that they don't offer them/honor that anymore. I asked how that could be as I just saw the ad about it on their website AND received the confirming text that very same day... He then repeated that they don't do it. No apology and also no explanation as to why- very weird. I was kind of annoyed so I asked him if he could ask a manager about it... He did and then after reviewing the text on my phone again (almost acting as if I was lying?), they said they could honor it. ? Very weird.   I ordered the vodka penne dish and they brought me some other rigatoni dish with sausage. After I alerted a runner that it wasn't what I ordered, they took the first dish away. I sat watching everyone else eat their food and eventually about halfway through their meal, I finally got the pasta I ordered. I also had a margarita as my first drink and ordered another before we got our food... Maybe 30 minutes later I finally got the second drink when everyone was done eating (I honestly thought the server had forgotten about the second drink by that time). But it wasn't even a margarita... It was a Moscow mule. By that time, I was just kinda over it and was going to let it go. My husband was frustrated and complained about the drink for me. They brought over a margarita for me as everyone was getting their checks. :| Honestly, I was pretty shocked that no manager ever came to our table after such a crappy experience and not even a small discount taken off our check. I didn't ask for one but it would have been a nice gesture since the meal was a complete disaster.  If you don't mind having crappy dinner service experiences, the food is great. The normal garlic knots as well as the spicy garlic knots are phenomenal. I love the vodka penne dish they have and others I dined with enjoyed their pizzas, seafood and a couple other pasta dishes."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for quite a while now. My husband and I went there for lunch yesterday. The decoration and atmosphere is really nice, more on the modern side. They have a chandelier made out of KitchenAid attachments, it is actually super cool! My husband wanted something refreshing so he decided to get the Peroni beer, to our surprise it was $6 for a pint. Even in our restaurant, the beers are cheaper! For that price I'd rather go to Santan Brewery for a beer. However, the wine by the glass are $5 until 5pm, I got the Chardonnay and it was quite nice. We decided to share a 20in pizza, the Uncle Louie. The crust of the pizza was very good, the pizza itself had lots of taste.  Overall it was a nice experience, however spending $50 for lunch for 2 is quite expensive.  Go there for the pizza, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Okay the food is good. The service is slow. Just don't be in hurry! The chairs are hard and not the most comfortable. Be okay to come back just will not be in a hurry! Gift card we're told cannot be tipped out on; interesting!"}
{"text":"Updating my review.    After my last visit the management team reached out to offer apologies and asked for another chance.  I know all kitchens have off nights so I figured I'd give it another go for happy hour.    Happy hour is pretty good.  You have a few different apps and pizzas discounted, $3 beers, and $5 wines.  I tried the meatball sliders which were a winner.  The sauce they're served with was really good.  It had a kick to it from the abundance of red pepper flakes in it but that's not a bad thing.  It gave it a ton of flavor.  Paired with the Konig Ludwig on tap, it was a nice start.  I also ordered an Uncle Louie pizza at the recommendation of management.  I have to confirm that I still don't love the pizza.  Both times I've been I've had the Rustica size.  I'll give the Sicilian a try at some point but I'm out after that if it's no good.  The sauce is too watery for pizza and the crust just doesn't do it for me.  The toppings were good and overall it gets the job done if you're a small group looking for a quick and inexpensive meal.   If you read my reviews you'll see I'm a sucker for a good happy hour and I like this addition to downtown Chandler so I'll round it up to 4 stars.  I hope they keep focusing on the kitchen to give the food the attention it needs to make this a long lasting staple of the area."}
{"text":"Met up with my date for the evening at San Tan Brewing Co down the street. It was quite busy inside, and very loud. Being that this was our second date, we both wanted a quieter atmosphere where we could talk and enjoy each others company. She had mentioned to me that Crust had just opened a few weeks ago, and that she had heard good things. Perfect, lets give it a try!  Initial impression was good. Nice decor, good atmosphere, very quiet (although it wasn't busy for a Monday evening at 7) and friendly staff to greet us. We had the White Bean Tuscsn Salad served in a bread crust bowl to start. It was dressed well (not too soggy) and tasted great. All salads can be served as half/whole, whole being enough for 2-3 to share, and the portion was more than adequate. We had a hard time deciding on what pizza to select. All of them sounded good, but in the end we decided to stay traditional and get a Sicilian grandma style pie. Now, I am born and raised in NJ, so I am ALWAYS skeptical of pizza joints outside of the tri-state area. We were chatting with our server Alexis, when I told her about this. She was happy to inform me that the owners are from NY and NJ, a team. When the pizza came it, it was perfect. WAY to large for 2 people, we both took home left-overs. A well seasoned sauce, that was very basic but tasted terrific. Good quality cheese and high quality pepperoni.   Overall I give Crust 4 stars. I will be coming back to try the other items on the menu or perhaps get a pie to go. Salad for 2, large pizza and 1 glass wine and 1 cocktail was approx 50. Not too bad for the amount of food and quality of the drinks."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for the first time on a Sunday night. We were a party of 6 and ordered the $40 family meal (serves 3-4 only on Sundays) and ordered a 20\" pizza thinking the family meal would not have been enough. They serve half of the pizza first and serve the second half later so it doesn't get cold. This is the first place I've been to that do this. The Gaelic knots and the pasta with the lemon garlic sauce were good. The pasta with the red vodka sauce was not too popular at the table. The pizza was pretty good there too. We had way too much leftover at the end. The 20\" pizza was bigger than we thought it would have been."}
{"text":"The food has always been really good here and the drinks are also great! A great place to come for some happy hour. Have to try their garlic knots, they're delicious! Service has been great, although I have seen it under staffed once, for the most part it's usually really good."}
{"text":"Ambience is excellent as was the service. We went for the pizza and had a choice of an individual or a 20 inch. They served half the pizza to start as it was so large and kept the rest warming in the kitchen. The half we got was enuf for us, it was tasty. We left the other half in the kitchen. We ordered the pizza crisp and it came out soggy. Anyway they should offer a smaller pizza option. Would visit again for starters and a drink"}
{"text":"Great food and service! The gluten free pesto ravioli and the bruschetta board were amazing! The pizza is huge and delicious! Love the red sangria, the pitcher is easily enough for 4! Have been there a few times and service has always been exceptional  great place for a family dinner or for happy hour with friends"}
{"text":"Found the restaurant too crowded with chairs and tables, and this was at 5:45 pm, and there were maybe fifteen to twenty guests inside, plus the employees.  I can only imagine how bad it might get during dinner hours!  There were empty tables all around Mom and me, yet the vacant chairs were touching the backs of our chairs.  It was ridiculous!  Mom didn't want to sit at the bar, of course...  We ordered the calamari ($5 during happy hour) for Mom, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=WZndowOfSJdq663X06CHdw&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA and the Moscow mule for me ($6 during hh; originally $12). https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=aNYyRedzzItzHnaYS2F2zg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Mom already knew I wanted to stay away from the calamari, but she offered the plate for me to try anyway, so I asked her if she thought it was good.  She said it's OK.  I asked her if it's worth my getting itchy all over, and she said no.  So there you have it.  It looked very tempting, but she said it wasn't worth my suffering afterwards.  The mule, made with \"premium Russian vodka,\" lime, mint, and \"premium ginger beer,\" was delightful and refreshing!  However, I didn't even finish half of it.  We'd just left the massage clinic, so I didn't want to get too buzzed and go overboard on the vodka consumption, especially if I was going to have a strong reaction to it later (I didn't).    We also ordered two rusticas- The Original (one of two choices on the happy hour menu for $5 each; the other was The NY), made with mozzarella, tomato, basil, and EVOO, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=s_x8n44YXlKoTGFH6NnLQQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA and Little Nicky, a \"4 cheese white pizza, spinach, tomatoes,\" but we subbed artichokes for the tomatoes. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8hYVAFCZAdFgX73SoKiExg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  Menu stated $8.50, but we were charged $9.   Possibly an extra charge for the artichokes, but this wasn't noted on the receipt- just that the Little Nicky was $9.  I found the tomato sauce on the Original to be too sweet for my taste, but the tomatoes were seasoned nicely.  Mom found them to be overcooked.  The mozzarella was delicious, though, and I liked the crust.  The Little Nicky's was definitely a lot tastier (Mmmm!!), our fave for all of these years since the original Scottsdale location opened in 2007!  Mom enjoyed the thickness of the dough here better than the thinner crusts we used to get in Scottsdale.  I didn't care for the thicker dough, since more dough meant less crispiness, but it was so tasty, I was willing to forgive.  In our state of hunger, we also ordered two small salads- The Spinach for Mom, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=G19I2cIBu1sgvg5GI6dwkg&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA and a Caesar for me. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2gqneKF5eYgP0kyh_9Ng2Q&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA  I really enjoyed my salad, and its generous shavings of parmesan, but I won't be ordering it again, because I itched after.  I'm assuming there may have been anchovies in the Caesar dressing?  If not, then the seasoned bread might have had cornmeal in it...  We actually tried to cancel the salads since Mom didn't want hers anymore after having the calamari and two slices of the pizzas on her plate, but when our server Brian went into the kitchen to cancel them, he returned with the salads on hand.  (I ordered the salads about five minutes after the pizza orders were placed.)  No worries.    I'm glad we were able to check out the Chandler location, and to enjoy the view of the water fountain through one of the windows, but we won't be returning here anymore.  (I might go by myself, during early HH, when there aren't a lot of people.)  It was too small and overcrowded with furniture!  We'll just try to visit the Scottsdale location more often-- we stopped going there a few years ago."}
{"text":"I was stoked to eat here before a night out as I have been to the other locations and have loved it! Well, the food was still what I know and remember, but the service was awful. There was a group of about 10 of us and we came in pretty late. The place was pretty empty and we were there for two hours! Everything was extremely slow and it took them 45 minutes to get us our checks, and even then they weren't right. They didn't even send a manager over to apologize for the bad experience. Needless to say, I will continue to return to the other locations to get my pizza fix, but don't think I will find myself here again."}
{"text":"I love the location. I am all about supporting local business. If you open up in downtown Chandler I will always give your restaurant a shot. I love the ambience of this place. It's darker and more quaint. I appreciate that. The servers are very friendly. All we got was a Sicilian style pizza with pepperoni, sausage and onions. It wasn't flavorless, but it also just didn't really taste like something I was excited to take a second bite of if I wasn't starving. Mind you I only got the Sicilian so I can't speak for the weird shaped regular style pizza. Maybe I'm not a big fan of Sicilian. I am not sure. All I know is that for how expensive it was I wasn't really impressed. None of the ingredients really stood to me which is a problem. I can see them sticking around because of the great location, but I don't see myself coming back with all the good pizza options we have in AZ."}
{"text":"This place was kind of a train wreck. Our server honestly seemed to be on drugs. He never completed his sentences, talked really fast, and acted confused and lost. We were at the restaurant for far too long due to the long periods of time that passed between sightings of him. I could get over the server being high if the food was good, but it wasn't. My wife got $17 clam linguini that tasted like plain pasta with clam flavored water on it. I got pizza that was completely average. Wouldn't recommend the place at all and probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the location, ambience, and the patio is wonderful and dog friendly! Food is good and wine pours are generous.  Servers are friendly."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times, salad, pizza and slider app.  The food is bland, missing some essential seasonings.  Sliders were very skimpy lots off bread hard to find the meat"}
{"text":"We waited half an hour after ordering with no sign of food coming to us, the only time our server came by was to drop a carafe of ice tea on our table, I guess so he wouldn't have to come back. Another table sent back  their entire table of food.  Slowness might be forgiven if they were busy, but it was 3 p.m. On a Sunday, and we were the only people seated inside, and there were only two tables seated outside. Not going back."}
{"text":"We came in about 1pm and only a few sitting at the bar.  Stood there for 5 minutes before someone came around the corner to seat us.  I guess we needed to order ice with our ice water cause there was none.  Shortage, I guess.  The ice tea was cloudy and had a very bad odor....sent it back!  The bruschetta tomatoes were clear and mushy....tasted like it had been previously made days ago and sat in the fridge uncovered!  GROSS!   The Stromboli had good flavor but very limited in quantity of ingredients inside.  Had to remind waitress to take off the tea from the bill.  She was very nice but not at the top of her game.  No worries I will not return.  Too many great restaurants to go try(this is not one on them)!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING.Their pizza is so authentic to old world pizza . I'm a native New Yorker and feel that Crust stands right up there with my favorite pizza joints I've found since moving to AZ 17 years ago. Ciao"}
{"text":"Ive heard people who are active online daters say that \"no one ever puts a bad photo of themself on the internet\".  So when you see a terrible pic of someone, it is what it is, a terrible pic....of THEM. Such is the case with Crust's 3.5 star reviews. That's not an unflattering photo, er I mean review, they weren't the victum of crazies or hostile hard to please reviewers, that's reality. They have 3.5 stars for good reason and 3.5 is generous. This place is terrible. Aside from the kitchen being very slow, the food stinks. We had the chicken kale salad, it was decent, but a tiny ball of goat cheese the size of a large marble isn't what I would call a salad \"with goat cheese\". The eggplant rolitni was ok, but the dough was undercooked so I can't say whether or not it could have been better. The pizzas were dreadful. The spinach, tomato and \"fresh mozzarella\" pizza was watery and soggy, presumably from the wetness of the tomato and spinach. Terrible. If this was fresh mozzarella it was very cheap quality. I've had fresh mozzarella slices on pizza many times and when cooked it never takes on a slick shiny surface. It looked like circles of white colored kraft singles and tasted like it too. The second  pizza had pesto ricotta, bacon and fresh mozzarella, the flavors were heavy and it was greasy, again the ingredients didn't taste like good quality. The crust on both pizzas was extremely thin, crunchy and browned to the point of being close to burned. This place needs to spend less time trying to ne clever by making pizzas shaped like a bicycle seat (what??) and just make a better pizza, period. Additionally, in my 45 years on earth I have NEVER seen a restaurant package up leftover pizza by putting the sluces on a flimsy paper plate and then putting the plate in a paper bag. I couldnt understand why the takeout was leaking everywhere (yes watery soggy pizza leaks) until I looked in the bag. Shocking. So that's it, no need ro give Crust another try. Plenry of delicious pizza options in town, there's just no reason to suffer at rhe hands of this place. 1 star is for the darling waitress, she was great and it wasn't her fault that this place was a train wreck. As I sit here at home writing this my stomach actually feels nauseated. Spare yourself and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I should of known when I saw the Kurt Warner marinara sauce that it was gonna be nasty.... I was right and we shared two of the \"guest favorites\" and they were nasty so I can just imagine what the other entrees tasted like. The people next to us had pizza which looked like maybe it was tasty but from the two items we chose its probably mediocre at best..."}
{"text":"One of the best hidden gems in downtown Chandler! The pizza is delicious and the single order is big enough to feed two. The garlic knots are to die for and the pizzas always come out exactly as ordered. The service is quick and the wait staff is always very friendly.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch yesterday at Crust. Great addition to the downtown area in Chandler. Yummy lunch specials, great attentive service and great decor too. Super excited to try dinner here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The interior has a low key but welcoming environment in a large open space.there were three very large (ten or more) parties while we were there. And yet service didn't miss a best with us, sometimes you get lost in a crowd but not here. Our server Darius was great, friendly, attentive and quick. There is a large bar, pizza oven and the outside patio has signs saying it is dog friendly. (It was too hot this day for anyone to be sitting on the patio.) The menu consists of pizza, salads, pasta and entrees. Not a huge menu, but enough choices for everyone and you can also build your own pasta dish if you don't like one of their menu selections. We both had pasta and really enjoyed it - the tortellini and the linguine with clam sauce. The fried zucchini appetizer was very good, and the salad portion was just right, not too small, not too big. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because we didn't taste the pizza and any place named Crust should be judged on its pizza. Also the pasta prices were two or three dollars higher than what I felt they should be. Restaurants are getting more expensive I've noticed, it just means I would come back here but not as frequently if the prices were slightly more in line with my expectations. Dinner for two with no cocktails was $64 before tip. We had two cannolis for dessert, but they are mini. So if you're hungry choose something else."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and daughter. Sat outside. Great atmosphere. The food was good. We tried the original pizza, but can't wait to go back  and try their pasta that looked amazing. The service was phenomenal. Managers constantly checked up on us to make sure all was well. Waiters that weren't even assigned to our table walked up to us to talk. They were all so nice. The sangria is a must have and the outdoor seating we chose was a great choice. I definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Sicilian pizza was great...until it cooled off. This went from one of the best pizzas I have ever had to chuckie cheese. Eat quickly. Also, pro tip go to the ostrich below or only eat with skinny people. There is not much room."}
{"text":"Three stars because our server was awesome. Started with the cheese plate which was excellent. The kitchen has got some issues and management doesn't understand service. We ordered a whole wheat pizza, a gentleman came down 20 minutes later to try to sell us on the white pizza they made in error but we weren't interested. Pizza finally shows and its mediocre at best. Table of 7 and the other half of it never got eaten. The crust was soggy and it literally tasted like someone didn't know what they were doing. BTW we were charged for the pizza, well done management!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Jennifer Paige - It's Just A Little Crush)  I see ya cookin' me a pizza It doesn't take a scientist To understand what's going on BoBites  If you see something at the bar Let's not over analyze Don't go too deep with it BoBites So let's eat what we'll eat Don't make a fuss and let's get crazy over food and drinks  Here's what I'll do We'll order booze Because we have a date at The Ostrich  It's just we're at the Crust (Crust) We like to eat every time we meet It's just (aah) some little thing (Crust) Cause everything I eat depends on this review Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la    Crust is a local pizzeria with 3 different locations throughout the valley.  Tonight I attended this local eatery at the Chandler location; funny cause I live down the street from the Scottsdale location.    I really like the look of the restaurant minus the pillars which as my friend pointed out; not very Feng Shui.  However, the place was popping with a full bar and large dining room.  We started out with a couple of drinks and the Bruschetta board a 4 for 10 meal; Classic Tomato, Goat Cheese & Roasted Garlic, Italian Antipasto, & Apple & Figs.  All was well but my favorite bite of the night was definitely the Italian Antipasto with Candied Lemon!  Great salty bite with a refreshing sour caramelized taste from the lemons giving this bruschetta some pop and definitely some love to my palates! For our pizza we went for a basic pepperoni pizza.  It was large for sure since they only served half of it first and then half later!  It's a thin crust east coast style pizza; cooked in fire oven.  The sauce was okay, but the thin and crispy crust and doughy ends really made this pizza a good eats.    Afterwards, as the night starts to begin you'll notice the crowd starting to dissipate.  That's cause every ones heading downstairs to The Ostrich; a basement cocktail lounge right outside the building.  With historical and haunting significant; this place definitely has an alluring feel and must go for all patrons just to experience! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Unbearably slow service. I won't return.  Food was fine, but there's lots of fine food around; waiting 25 minutes to pay your bill, or 15 minutes to get your water refilled is not a model for a successful restaurant. There seemed to be only one waiter in the entire restaurant for lunch. There was another maybe manager, who was more content to sit down with her laptop and walk around than see how the customers were doing."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot!  We ordered the garlic knots- highly recommend them!  Great service and amazing food"}
{"text":"Well I've been to the Crust about 15 times. When they first opened the food was Great!! Now the prices have gone up and the quality of the food has gone down. On January 19,2018 my husband and I had lunch. We waited a long time for our food and when our pizza finally came out it was raw and disgusting. This had never happened before. We were never asked if our food was ok and I had to go and alert our absent server of the issue. We were not offered a refund and I ended up asking for a manager. The lady that finally came to the table asked if we wanted our food replaced. We had already been there more than an hour and my husband had to be at a meeting so we said no we need to go. It was very upsetting, between the wait, the lack of attention and the raw pizza, we were DONE and swore we would never go back."}
{"text":"I came to Crust looking for an enjoyable lunch but was sadly disappointed with the lack of service they have. Very disappointed in the overall service of the restaurant, will not be coming back again. We sat down at the bar for 10 minutes and did not get greeted. So we sat ourselves to the patio tables, and waited to get served on. Had to ask someone for menus and who ever we asked for menus from the person made us feel in the wrong for moving tables. We got our drinks ordered and he forgot to take 1 of the 3 orders.. Just doesn't seem to be happy to serve us.. But the food was great and that's where the 3 stars are coming from."}
{"text":"Was excited to try location closer to us. Went in on non busy weeknight last week. Server was very quiet, couldn't hear her and not much of a people person. Put in an order for pasta for my hungry daughter with oil and garlic and she brought out plain spaghetti and told me oil and cheese are on the table. 20 mins later I asked if her meatballs were coming out. Oh I forgot to put them in. No apology or here let me grab them at no charge. So we just forgot about them. Had to ask me what beer my husband ordered again cause he was in bathroom and she forgot. Never came around to ask if he wanted another drink but manager finally did. First and second half of pizza came out almost cold. Couldn't guess why on that. Only two tables of two and one table of 8 at the time. Leftover pizza thrown on paper plates and in a brown paper bag with nothing covering them. Will not return would rather drive extra distance to Scottsdale or just go to Pomo downtown Gilbert!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, but never again after our last experience this Saturday evening.   The first time we visited this place it was late afternoon in early December 2016. We were still able to order off the lunch menu and got happy hour drink prices. Our group of 4 ordered a variety of pizzas and sandwiches with beer, wine and drinks. The combination of less expensive lunch prices and happy hour drink specials reduced the bill sufficiently to satisfy us for the just okay food. I would rate the lunch experience 3 stars.  This Saturday our same group of 4 arrived for an early dinner. We requested to sit inside because the wind was gusting up to 45 miles an hour outside. Once we were sat, we discovered that they had their fans blowing on high, so it was as if we were sitting in the wind. It took a while to get someone's attention (not our server, who was MIA most of the meal) and they finally turned down the fans. None of us liked our entrees. One entrée was sent back because the fish was severely overcooked and chicken marsala was ordered in its place. The marsala was in a sauce thickened with corn starch - seriously?? Is this a cheap Chinese restaurant? My NY Clam Sauce was too thin and the pasta was undercooked and served in a big clump. Neither of our dinning companions cared for their dishes either. I would rate the dinner experience 1 star.  This is not real Italian food - not even close. The food just isn't any good and it's WAY overpriced for what you get. You can tell that there is no love or care that goes in to the preparation of the food. That whole attitude spreads through the entire experience and leaves a bad taste in your mouth, especially once you pay the outrageous bill."}
{"text":"We are good customers of Crust in Scottsdale and love the place.  We happened to be in Chandler and saw this Crust.  It was dusk and the sun had gone down and it was in mid to late 60's.  Freezing inside the restaurant as all doors and windows were wide open and ceiling fans on high. Ordered a couple of the personal type pizzas.  Not hot and not good! Not as described on the menu either. Two personal pizza's, and  drinks were in and out for over $ 50.00.  Staff spend most of their time standing around chatting with each other.  Please send your staff to Scottsdale for training and serve your food hot,"}
{"text":"We loved the food and had fantastic service. I had tortellini, husband had sausage and penne, sister had eggplant parmigiana and all three fantastic. Garlic knots and spinach/artichoke dip for appetizer were also so yummy. Friends had pizzas and loved them. Portions are huge so go ahead and share with someone. We were there in time for happy hour too.  The only downside is the noise level is way too much. There were 8 people at our table but could only talk to person sitting next to us."}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here on Thursday evening. We arrived at 8pm as I had just flown into the area, and we asked if they still had time to serve us, to which the host replied yes, that the kitchen closes at 9 but they let guests stay however long to finish their meals.. Well, we were reminded of the closing time about 6 times in a pretty rude manner throughout our meal (we tried to order as quickly as possible). We were rushed and felt anxiety the whole time. Then when we were done we sat there waiting for our check for a while. When the server brought us our check she was wearing a backpack all set to leave! The food was decent but this service we felt was very unwelcoming. There are many other restaurants in the area but we chose this thinking it looked delicious. Others were there eating and we even double checked to make sure the time was ok. Definitely wasn't ok."}
{"text":"I went to Crust on a Saturday night with a large group and everyone's meal was delicious.  Negatives would include a very very loud atmosphere, with music and customer sounds that made it impossible to carry on a conversation without yelling and lip-reading.  I did ask the manager to turn the music down a tad during the time we were there, and she obliged willingly, although conversation was still mostly impossible. The place was very busy, packed with people and with a couple of birthday parties going on.  Our waitperson was excellent but the servers failed us.  Two of the 14 meals at the table didn't arrive for many many MANY minutes after the rest of us were served.  Being polite, I waited to start eating until everyone was served, therefore my otherwise delicious braised beef was cold by the time I got to it.  The two late dinners also arrived cold, meaning they had been sitting somewhere unattended before anyone noticed that they needed to be delivered.  A complaint was given to the very attentive manager and she made it right, taking the late meals off the bill and providing the entire table with a platter of desserts.  The food was excellent and we were taken care of in the long run.  Would not mind trying it again if the opportunity arises, maybe on a less busy weekday."}
{"text":"I have never been so underwhelmed on a first visit to a restaurant. The garlic knots were horribly average, the grilled artichoke and Burrata was more like an artiJOKE, and the individual pizza is in a phalic shape and honestly Dominos tastes better than this place. Will not be returning unless it's for drinks if San Tan Brewery is too busy."}
{"text":"I went w a date to the bar & we had drinks & a dessert...I had the SMOKED BANANA...& a merlot. Both were awesome! WoW! Great atmosphere as well! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great wine selection. Pizza was awesome. Gluten free ravioli was amazing. Hostess was blah but the server made up for it. Manager was very accommodating. He kept our takeout food warm while we had a nightcap at their underground bar. The bar was like stepping into another zip code. Felt like you were in San Fran. Down to the smell!  Pretty awesome we have a place this cool in DTC"}
{"text":"We have eaten here 5 times, 2 lunches and 3 dinners. The food is inconsistent but I do appreciate the gluten free options, when they are actually available. Sometimes they are sold out. The spinach dip is really melted cheese with a couple of spinach pieces and 1 artichoke heart - skip this dish. My biggest disappointment is with the management and serving staff. We were sitting at the bar eating lunch and not even 5 feet away a male and female manager were having a meeting and discussing all of their challenges. One of which was about a specific server and is performance issues except for when he is medicated! Really? Highly inappropriate. The overall serving experience is lacking. Basic serving skills not displayed here. It has a lot of potential but the more I go the less I like it. Think I'm done here for a while."}
{"text":"Location and ambiance are great. Food was also pretty good.  Service was good and we didn't have a long wait. Would go back."}
{"text":"The biggest issue I had while dining here was the atmosphere. Extremely loud and crowded. You could barely have a conversation or walk to the bathroom. The prices were a little pricey for Italian food especially when you take into consideration that dinner salads weren't included. That being said, the food was tasty and service was pretty good. All and all decent experience, it would have been much better if it wasn't for the environment."}
{"text":"I give totally honest reviews based on my experience and I had a great one at Crust. My husband and I went out to dinner and it was our first time here. I wasn't sure what to expect based on some of the reviews I read but I was super happy we tried them out.  It was a Thursday evening and it looked pretty packed in there. We were given a table immediately and couldn't wait to try the spicy garlic knots that we read about! We also ordered the bruschetta.  The server we had was wonderful ( forgot his name, late 20's early 30's possibly, dark hair and complexion) anyway, he was very attentive and pleasant.  The appetizers were amazing! The garlic knots were to die for! They were pretty large and definitely worth the price.   For dinner, we ordered the veal rollatini,and the frutta di mare arabiatta. I loved the food! It was very tasty in my opinion and the portipns were decent.  My only complaint would be that they brought the entrees out only about halfway through starting our entrees, that felt a little rushed.   At one point, the manager came out ( forgot his name also but he totally looked like Seth Mcfarland) he checked on our table,,asked how everything was etc and then asked if we would be having drinks at the Ostrich afterwards. He said he would personally escort us downstairs when we were finished with dinner. I was very impressed with their customer service. We cannot wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Great Service and Pizza! I was in a hurry on Saturday night and the food came out quick and was delicious!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely. Sitting at a table on the sidewalk near downtown Chandler on a balmy spring evening is always a good thing. However....  We ordered drinks. My husband's beer was fine, but my wine had gone off a bit. The sweet and attentive waiter brought a glass of a different wine, but it wasn't much better. When the dinner came, my husband liked his Stromboli but my pappardelle was mediocre. The pasta was overcooked and actually clumped together-- possibly cooked an hour or so before I ordered it. The sauce was okay but not great. This is not an inexpensive restaurant. If you're looking for a fine Italian dining experience, I cannot recommend Crust."}
{"text":"Tried Crust in downtown Chandler (for the 2nd time) and we were thrilled with our meal and service.  We went with another family so there was a wide range of food ordered from pasta, to salads, to meat and cheese boards to pizza and it was all delicious!  The portions are huge so we have lunch for tomorrow. Anytime that happens, I see value in the fact that you're really getting two meals for the price of one.  The ambiance was fun and lively and our service couldn't have been better. I have to say our favorite part was the dessert board that included tiramisu and cannolis that we're to die for!"}
{"text":"We went to Crust a few weeks ago to celebrate a friends birthday and had an absolutely miserable experience. It was Friday night around 7 o'clock and we were told it would be around 20 min for a table on the patio or an hour for a table inside. Wasn't a big deal as we were still waiting for others to join so we went to the bar to have a drink.  We checked in a few times and were assured a table would be ready soon. After an hour of waiting one of the managers told us that they had some new reservations and there would not be a table available in the foreseeable future and could be 11 o'clock until we were seated.  We decided to finish our drinks and head elsewhere. We signed out and were then told there were seats on the patio. This same manager then came out to chat, we asked if he could turn our tables heaters on and he let us know they couldn't turn the heaters on because they were broken, and we couldn't pull other tables together because it was a fire code violation. We let him know that we were unhappy with the experience and he said he would send his GM out.  She then came out and it really went downhill. I have never encountered someone so condescending in the service industry as this GM. She was extremely rude and more interested in arguing whether we waited an hour or an hour and fifteen minutes then doing anything productive to fix the situation. When we told her we were going to leave and not be back due to our experience she smiled and sarcastically told us \"thank you, have a good night\".  Hopefully they are able to provide some training to fix the poor management at this restaurant. It was a relatively small issue that could not have been handled any worse and led to a miserable experience."}
{"text":"Opening day and excellent experience. Food was delicious and service was attentive and friendly. We had garlic knots, antipasto salad, pizzas, lasagna and warm butter cake for dessert. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Argh... first impressions...  Walked in the door around 8pm on a S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y... NIGHT... and let me tell ya, it was hella loud son.  Like, The Metro nightclub in Riverside, three decades ago loud.  Like you have to yell at a girl to ask her to dance loud.  However, the iced tea was wonderfully tropical, and I should know, just coming from the tropics.  I ordered the eggplant parm, because I love it, and can usually tell if a place is going to be good by how it turns out.  Fact: Carlo & Emilies has a great eggplant parm.  Even Buca has a pretty good eggplant parm... but not these guys.  It also came with fettuccine and red sauce, topped with a croissant.  Yeaaaah, like my mom used to make... from a canned sauce.  Granted, I should walk away with a lesson learned, but I'll return to try the pizza... next time with earplugs."}
{"text":"Crust served its guests expired food. You can find this out this factual info on the Maricopa esd website. I already posted the link but Crust paid to take the review down. So I will continue on a weekly basis to post the failing health inspections until they find it to expensive to do so and just leave the 1 review I leave."}
{"text":"Just went to Crust for the second time terrible as usual do not recommend this. This is a minus one star"}
{"text":"Id give this place 4 stars for atmosphere and probably 2 stars for the food if im being honest. For a place called Crust you would think they would have bomb pizza. They do not.   Ironically the entire group agreed the one thing off was THE CRUST. Tasted like bicuit dough or something. Also comes out shaped like a Penis at happy hour, which is a little weird."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst ran establishment in the valley!  The police were called on my wife and I as a result of refusing to pay for something we did not receive.  Their process is to bring half of the pizza 1st followed by the 2nd half as soon as the 1st half is consumed.  The only problem with this process, which in theory is good, is you need to ensure the 2nd half is ready as soon as the 1st half is done.  In our case that was not the situation.  We ordered a regular cheese pizza with 2 side salads.  The salads arrived ~10 minutes before the 1st half of the pizza arrived. which is fine.  We finished the 1st half of the pizza and waited ~15 minutes, only after asking the waiter for our 2nd half, to be delivered.  At this point both my wife and i stated we are no longer hungry so we don't want the 2nd half.  The waiter stated they would just box it up to go - which i informed them that we do not want it and will not be paying for it.  That is when the manager, which I think is the manager, came over and ask what the concern was.  After explaining the situation he stated that is too bad but we're obligated to pay for the whole pizza even though we didn't eat it.  After debating with this individual and stressing the point that I'm not paying for something I did no receive, they threatened to call the police, which they did.  I stated i would pay for the drinks, salad and 1/2 of pizza I received but nothing more.  At this point a 2nd manager arrived and spoke to my wife and I and stressed we're responsible for the total purchase regardless of the way we received it and that they would press charges for not paying the full amount if we vacated the premises.  I informed them that we would wait for the police and they could settle the matter as they see fit.  As the police arrived the establishment changed their stance and only charged me for the items I consumed.  The way this situation was handled and the embarrassment both my wife and I endured is unacceptable!  This establishment needs to train their employees on how to effectively handle discrepancies to create a win-win situation.  I've never been more humility and embarrassed in my life and to have the police called on my wife and I is unspeakable.  CRUST you should be ashamed of yourself and the individuals involved should be reprimanded for their actions.  I highly recommend anybody thinking about eating at this establishment should rethink their choice!  In response to the owners comments below: This is a complete lie and you are obviously miss informed.  I never banged my fist on the table!  I was not intoxicated or remotely close to being intoxicated.  This comes down to nothing more then having incompetent employees and poor service.  Who in their right mind would want a 2nd half of a pizza 15 minutes after finishing the 1st half.  When the issue was raised the only response we received was \"well what do you want me to do\".  Which at that point I stated I would only pay for the items I consumed (2 beers, 2 salads and a half of pizza).  At which point he stated No you will pay for the whole pizza or I will call the cops.  That is exactly how it happened and not all this other added activity that you claim occurred.  That is just your way of trying to validate that your staff was in the right.  It is sad that you think this is the right way to address this issue.  I could also understand that things happen but it's all in the way you address and handle the situation.  The establishment was not full, there were plenty of staff so to have a miss in performance to this degree is unacceptable but if that is ok with you as the owner - that is your business.  I would also challenge your statement around intoxication.  If that was what your team thought why did you turn the police away when they arrived - it was obvious at that point your team was wrong!  After reading through numerous google reviews it is clear I'm not the only person that has had a problem with your leadership team!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just enjoyed a delicious lunch at Crust Simply Italian in downtown Chandler  ! The atmosphere was simple yet relaxing . The food was outstanding , and the service excellent !! My husband had the Burretta cheese and grilled artichoke appetizer and the Filet Sliders as his entree , there was 3 per order and they didn't skimp on the Filets ! He even brought one home !! I had the Fried Calamari with a delicious spicy sauce appetizer and the Pizza Rustica , a thin crust pizza with the most fantastic red sauce, marinaded tomatoes, fresh Mozzarella and Fresh Basil !!  They don't skimp on portions except for the Canoli that my husband had , it was ONE TINY CANOLI  but he said it was very good !  All in all we will be returning to this excellent restaurant often !!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour.  Good prices on beer, wine and well drinks, and a fair selection of $5 appetizers.  The meatball sliders were delicious.  The tiramisu was tasty, but do yourself a favor and avoid the coffee.  I initially asked for cappuccino, and was brought weak, black coffee.  When I asked where the foam was that one would find on a typical cappuccino, I was told that the server had \"pushed the button for cappuccino\" (don't EVER say that to an Italian), but \"apparently the machine was not working\".  When I said that I would just have regular coffee, I was brought - you guessed it - weak, black coffee, apparently made by the same machine, which makes (supposedly), espresso, Americano, and cappuccino.  They were gracious enough to not charge me for the coffee, although I did drink it just to cut the sweetness of the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Went for a work HH and ordered a glass of $wine and the calamari. It wasn't super crispy and was a little below average but I didn't want to say anything since our table was a large group. I checked my credit card and was charged twice. $13 and then $15...Will call and dispute later today."}
{"text":"The pizza and service is fabulous. They have great portions and flavor and a vast drink menu. Today was a busy day for them and the floor manager (Travis) went above and beyond for service, as well as the staff. Thank you for the great experience, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Mike was amazing. He was attentive to our party of 9 and on top of everything! Per Mike's suggestion, I had the rigatoni - it was spicy and delicious. We were a bit boisterous (we were celebrating a birthday) and they weren't judgmental or berating. In fact, they brought us dessert! I'll definitely come back here if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here for a while and finally pulled the trigger.  We were not disappointed.  We ordered the cheese dip, which comes with different breads, amazing!  Also, the \"individual\" pizzas are fairly good sized.  Cleverly shaped like large pizza slices.  They have a few custom combinations which were fantastic."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Crust a few days ago we usually have good service here but ,on this night it took about an hour and a half to get our pizza by the time we got it it was cold so I talk to a manager about just getting our money back and she refused to give us our money back and said I would just go put your order in again so we said OK about 20 minutes going by my friend decided just to order her and her kids a pizza too so now I'm waiting 45 minutes and I went and asked where the pizza is and she said it's coming don't worry about it so then five minutes later it came and we were still waiting for my friend pizza so we walked up there with the kids three little kids and we asked her where the other pizza was because now my pizza getting called and she said don't worry about it already took care of you and started rambling on a few words and I said OK maybe you could be a little polite about it and she started yelling to me that she is a Mexican and she's allowed to be rude because that's what Mexicans are she said well I'm not prejudiced and I am Hispanic also told her and that I am no way is rude she was to us my friends little girl was so scared she started crying and the other two just stood there frozen I talk to the other manager and he said he would take care of it as we were sitting there still waiting for her pizza for 10 or 15 more minutes he never went and talk to her or did anything about it I just can't believe it so disappointed in this place!! Here's a couple of pictures of her so if you guys see her BEWARE she is not a nice person !"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful surprise! We had carpaccio and it was a highlight! Next, we had a salad which was delicious, light, and tasty. Finally, we shared lemon chicken and it was just enough. I was impressed with our waiter who gave us informed suggestions, was there and gone, and didn't hurry us out! I would definitely try this place again!"}
{"text":"Crust Chandler is really cute. Huge banquet in the back which appears to seat 8+ & 1/8 wine barrels used as sconses. The focal point in the rear is the pizza oven. Running along the south wall is the bar.  The menu is the same as the other Crust locations. I was here with S, part of the AOB crew. He got an invite from his PR friend to enjoy some tasty treats. Crust put out a small buffet on a 6 top towards the back. There was salad, penne & marinara, huge bacon wrapped shrimp, stuffed shroom caps, fried mozz, chicken skewers, garlic knots, and 1 pizza I didn't get to try. No biggie really but isn't this place named \"Crust\"? So I wrongly assumed that they would focus on promoting their PIZZA. I mean I don't think they're known for their chicken skewers or stuffed mushroom caps but maybe... It seemed like a buffet that a mid 20's, just graduated college type would put out at a party. Don't get me wrong. Everything I tasted was good but it was VERY pedestrian.  The servers were very polite and on their game. I met the partners behind Crust, Mike & Mitch, both nice guys. We got a tour & mini history lesson on the property which was neat. The cool deal-e-o will be when The Ostrich opens in the basement. It's going to be a speakeasy type lounge. Uber cool. I would like to get on a soapbox for just a second. As I said the food was set out buffet style on a 6 top table. You grab a plate, fill it with goodies and go back to your table. Well, there were 3 women who never got the memo. They stood AT the buffet table and chowed. Seriously? Dumbasses! Even S went up for more food & to see if they would get the hint but they just backed away from the food long enough for S to put some on his plate & then moved right back up to the table. And they say ignorance is bliss!  Ok, that's not part of my rating. Just needed to get that out there. Groovy ambiance, great service, pedestrian food, no pizza. 3 Stars"}
{"text":"Fantastic environment! Loved the food. Loved the drinks. Loved the service. If you want a fun upbeat time come here."}
{"text":"hanging out in chandler for the jazz festival decided to stop and grab lunch. Food was AMAZING.  ordered fettuccine carbonarra with shrimp. Michael our server was on point"}
{"text":"It was just OK. Expected more. When we arrived, the bartender seemed nice enough, asking if we were going to eat or drink. We said both and ordered calamari immediately... had drinks and waited and waited and waited for our appetizer. It took over half an hour for fried calamari. If it had been busy, we would have understood, but the place was dead - a \"ghost town\" as the bartender kept saying. In fact, he complained the whole time we were there. Complained it was too slow and then complained when it got busy. The bar started filling up and he said to his manager, \"I knew it. I called it. I said at 9:45 this would happen!\" At one point, he seemed to almost lose his mind when he had to answer the phone. All of this dramatic conversation in front of customers made us uneasy. The worst was seeing what appeared to be THREE managers standing around talking while the bartender struggled to keep up. Never once did they ask us, or any other customers, if they could help us... despite having our empty glasses pushed in front of us signaling we were ready for another. The only time a manager stepped up was to remind his bartender to tell everyone last call 10:25. Get everyone out as close to 10:30 as possible. Again, another awkward thing for a customer to overhear. So bottom line is the calamari was average, the bruschetta was good, but Crust definitely lacks customer service. Fix that and they'll have a good thing going."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful meal at Crust. Our waiter, Michael, was one of the best servers we've had in a very long time. Attentive, friendly, efficient. We never waited for anything. We had a the bruschetta appetizer- delicious. Ordered a large pizza that was phenomenal and I had the tortellini with peas and prosciutto. Amazing. Monday is 1/2 bottled wine night- enjoyed a delicious and inexpensive Chianti. We have never been disappointed with either the food or service, but tonight was especially good. Would highly recommend Crust for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and atmosphere. Had the chicken franchese and a rustica which was amazing. Will definitely be back! Went down below to The Ostrich after dinner which was really cool as well."}
{"text":"Very poor experience.  Food very bland and service was extremely slow.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was very good, the server Mike was excellent! Will definitely come back to enjoy some pasta and try the pizza too."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and it was even better than my first visit! We tried the bruschetta which was perfect for two people. We asked the bartender to pair our app with some drinks and he did a great job with the Sorry, Not Sorry and a glass of Moscato. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special if you enjoy pizza also they have an amazing chicken parmigiana and most at my table wishes they had gotten that. I wasn't disappointed and would get again. The patio is awesome with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The bar opens open very nicely to the whole place. Great place to relax enjoy the area and have a nice beverage."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried Crust for the first time on a whim.  Came in for a late lunch/early dinner so the place was not very busy.  Sat at the bar and were served by John.  John was super friendly and helped us with the happy hour and enter menu.  We had a couple specialty cocktails and mixed bruschetta to start.  The apple and fig as well as the roasted garlic were nothing short of amazing. We also had personal pizzas, which ended up being quite large.  I had the Uncle Lois, mostly meat and Parmesan and she had the godmother , a pesto/bacon.  Both were very good and although we could not Finnish all the pizza I am pretty sure it will make amazing leftovers.  We loved the food, the staff was great and the ambiance was cool/modern.  Had a great time and will be back for sure.  Highly recommend if you are in the area looking for good Italian cuisine."}
{"text":"The service was awkward, the flavors were off, and the execution on the food was embarrassing for a professional kitchen. Phallic shaped pizzas with way too many toppings to even bake properly, let alone look appetizing."}
{"text":"Don't read any nasty reviews about this place.   It's absolutely amazing and worth the try.  I definitely recommend the garlic knots and the meatball sliders.  The staff was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"What can I say? I suppose I would give them another try. My girlfriends and I went the night of the Tumbleweed tree lighting and Christmas parade. It was very busy. No it was super busy so the service was a bit slower and the pizza was just ok. Several of my friends frequently dine at Crust so it must be better on a \"regular\" night. It's in a great location and I love the patio! Yeah, I will give them another shot and see how it goes."}
{"text":"I'm really excited about this place! The food was excellent and loved the happy hour!! The mozzarella app was the bomb.com was like mozzarella sticks on crack... Yurm!! And the pizza was very good my friend describes it as phallic as for the shape... Can't disagree! I would've preferred more mozzarella throughout but I love me some cheese! The sauce was sweet and very unique and original. I had the margarita and I loved that it was so simple without all the processed crap and was just tequila, fresh lime juice and agave however it was very light on the tequila... Boo step it up on the booze... Keep your customers happy can't wait to try the Calamari... Looked amazing. Also I can't wait to sit outside and open up those windows, the noise seems to bounce around in there and got very loud. Waitress was a sweetheart and manager checked in often great job staff!! We'll be back often!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza. Great lunch and happy hour prices. Wonderfully friendly staff. Mike, was a pleasure! Try the cannolli  ( if you join the text promotion,  the 1st one's free ). Tuesday-Saturday, the Ostrich downstairs is and old speakeasy,  decorated as such."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch.  For some reason the roll up door by the bar was wide open.  It was 45 degrees outside.  Really???  Who does that?  As I've come to realize the heat in this place doesn't work well to begin with.  It works even worse when you roll up window on a day when it's 45 degrees outside.  Inside temperature never got above 68 degrees during the time we were there (I kept checking the thermostat on the wall).  I'm still satisfied with the food but I'm beginning to think there are no adults managing the store as this isn't the first time I've mentioned the cold temperatures in the restaurant yet the problem persists (exacerbated of course by rolling up the window by the bar on a 45 degree day)."}
