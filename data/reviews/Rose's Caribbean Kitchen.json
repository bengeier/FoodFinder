{"text":"My go to place for Jerk Chicken in brampton. Best price and food is good. Nice staff also. Often order a kerk or oxtial combo and theyll allow you to buy a piece of fried chicken on the side if you want"}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the plaza so it's pretty easy to miss, but you should definitely make an effort to find it. It's in the southwestern corner of the plaza. 

I ordered jerk chicken, curried goat, and some roti on the side for takeout a few days ago. The service was super friendly and so sweet. They actually talk to you as if you're a human being. Imagine that! If the food weren't exceptionally good (which it is), I would probably keep coming just for the great service. It's annoying to put up with \"miserable\" service as Brittany puts it in her review.

The food was delicious. My jerk chicken was juicy, meaty and tender. The rice and peas were so flavourful. My dining companion really enjoyed the goat as well. This is probably going to become my regular Caribbean takeout joint."}
{"text":"First time trying this place order the lrg jerk chicken meal. The chicken was okay not to spicy which I prefer when I get Jerk, and could taste the clove spice a little to much. They were out of veg so they gave me a coleslaw. The coleslaw was definitely the best I have had from a Jamaican place. The rice and pea had a little too much coconut flavour and I asked for extra ox tail gravy over it and it was not so much extra. I think the place is average for Brampton Jerk places and compares the same to most I have been to around here. The price is good. I probably won't return for the Jerk Chicken because I like the hot one which I can't find too often around here, but may go back to try the roti.. I will let you know how that is."}
{"text":"Tried this place on recommendation from a buddy at the pub, on new years eve we were talking about some good places to eat nearby and he suggested Rose's

I just quickly popped in tonight and got a large jerk chicken dinner to go.  

All around a pretty solid meal, chicken was yummy (especially the drumstick, wow) and the curry chicken sauce on top of the rice was nice, should have only asked for more

Out of steamed veg so I got coleslaw instead which was pretty decent.  Girl who served me was friendly although a bit confused maybe , they seemed to be out of a lot of stuff

I would return!"}
{"text":"Roses is situated in small complex in Brampton near giggling tomatoes. It's pretty hidden and easy to drive by. There's is a sweet old lady that is happy to serve you (unlike most jamaican restaurant they usually look miserable).

I usually don't go to Rose's but my mom said they had better prices then the jamaican restaurant I usually go to. I was in the mood for fried fish but I'm not eating carbs so I wanted a side steamed vegetables. I paid 13 dollars and some change for a large container of steamed cabbage, broccoli, and peppers with fried snapped topped with pickled onions. I was pleasantly surprised with the portion size as the place I usually go charges 15 dollars for half the size. 

I've also tried their chicken soup and it was delicious. I would pass on the oxtail as I found it kind of bland. A lot of jamaican restaurant serve milder versions of food to accommodate the western palate. I end up pouring hot sauce all over my food. Overall the portion sizes, price and customer service are worth the money and I will be back."}
{"text":"Best value-food made fresh and always offer me extra oxtail sauce on my rice with my jerk, and their cakes are made in house. Highly recommend the rum cake if they have it available."}
