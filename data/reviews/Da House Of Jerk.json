{"text":"I came here and ordered a large jerk chicken with salad & coleslaw, and a small jerk chicken with rice and peas. It came to $20 with tax, without drink or tip or anything.

my salad and jerk ended up being an entire large container filled with coleslaw and the same amount of jerk as my boyfriends small. When I brought the container back to tell the lady she forgot my salad, she told me that they didnt serve salad, only coleslaw. 

Then why would you take my order for salad & coleslaw (I said them seperately so she knew I wanted two different items) without telling me? I wouldn't have been so mad, but i would have ordered a small and saved myself money!

The food is nothing really special. Standard tasting. The coleslaw was pretty bland as well.

The place was HOT as hell as well."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy the jerk chicken at all, there was no spice of flavour toot just overall bland. Also the \"coleslaw\" I received was a small mixed green salad far from coleslaw. The only thing I enjoyed was the rice and peas with gravy other than that it was not good. Our waitress was very nice though and provided decent service."}
{"text":"The food is good and I like the way it's decorated inside but some of the order takers and waitresses that works there have no customer service skills to save their life. The way they speak with you as if you are a bother and they can't bother with helping you or even answering your questions. 

If you don't mind getting mediocre perhaps rude service with a stinky attitude, then enjoy the food and that's  all.

I agree with the other reviewer about the Oxtail. I've ordered it quite a few times now and I always get more bone that meat. I even asked my boyfriend what parts of the ox are they getting this from because I've had oxtail from a lot of restaurants and this is the boniest I've had.  The only reason I like it is because it has really good flavor. They have recently raised the price on this so you are now paying more for less. 

If you have nowhere else to go then sure go here but this should be down on the list.

You don't get what you pay for!!!! You'll see."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time coming here. Got take out and it's the worst tasting jerk chicken meal I've ever had. And for the amount they charge you may as well save your money and go somewhere else. They won't be seeing a dime from me again!"}
{"text":"We used this space to host our child's dedication party early this year. The guests loved the food. Although some (including my family and I ) thought the jerk chicken was salty. 

The food was generally good. I would rate it about a 3.5 or 4. 

But this rating is based more on the use of the space. We would rate organization a 1. The space was not ready as was promised by start time. In fact it was still in a mess from the party the night before. When we got there, we had to wait for one person to do all the cleaning - that included mopping and reorganizing the furniture. The balloon decoration I was promised was not even kept. 

The worst part of it all was that 90% of our guests arrived while the cleanup and setup was still taking place. 

The rating should be a 1 but for the sake of the food, I give it a 3."}
{"text":"This place is you're typical jerk place that never has half the menu available. I asked for jerk pork - \"we not have that\". Can I have a pattie - \"we not have that\". 

The jerk chicken is mediocre, Mr. jerk still has the best jerk pork. And takes the cake for the best spot for jerk food.

This place maybe a front for something else because there is no way this place can afford the rent for that big of a place for jerk food only. 

I live in Rexdale so I'm a comfort food type of guy because of the area I'm from...I love food that tastes great and is priced reasonable, being located on the border of Rexdale this place was not able to establish this. For the reasons above I'm not going to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Decent lunch specials. Love the curry goat. Great value. Just the right size for a lunch size meal."}
{"text":"Poor service, actually kind of rude. Jerk chicken is not that good. Better off going to Tropical Joe's and Albion mall"}
{"text":"Da House of Jerk is a great restaurant offering most of the usual Jamaican dishes.
The prices are reasonable compared to other places but the soups they make are AMAZING. The selection usually changes each day, although the chef loves to cook Fish Tea. One taste and you'll know why.
This is now a daily order for myself and others at my work.
If you love Jamaican soup, try this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They know what they are doing. If you're familiar with Jamaican spots the running joke is 9 times out of 10 they will be out of what you want but this place is more like 5 times out of 10 but they're nice about it. Always satisfies me unlike some places that are stinggggyyy. 
Been here on more than one occasion and it's pretty consistent. 


Bill was around $30 for the meal in the photo"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable Caribbean restaurant by Woodbine Casino. Jerk Chicken was full of flavor and rice was excellent also.
The have a nice setup with a bar and dance floor on the right side of the restaurant. My go to when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"First time going here and it was amazing. I had ordered the fried chicken dinner with oxtail gravy, rice and coleslaw and it was so satisfying. Portion was great and waiting for the food to come did not take long at all! I recommended this place to all my friends and they love it! Although a bit far from where I live...It is definitely worth the trip"}
{"text":"I just came from this place and I ordered a fried chicken and rice Platter. I was very pleased with how they prepared the chicken and the rice was very good. The chicken fell right off the bone and the sauce they use is very sweet which makes the chicken taste even better. I give them five stars for reception and food preparation. I'd recommend this place to many of my friends and this is going to be my go to spot for a taste of jamaican cuisine."}
{"text":"Surprisingly has the best Ackee and Saltfish I've ever had.
The fried dumplings can use some work, but the Ackee and Saltfish was delicious. The fried plaintains were a good side, that worked well with my boiled bananas and boiled dumplings.

5 stars for this place."}
{"text":"I have NO IDEA what the other reviewer was thinking but I can assure you they have never eaten jerk prior to eating here. This would be the LAST jerk place in town I would goto for lunch and I will tell you why. 

on my first trip the service was super slow, took literally 10minutes for my order to be put out. But wait time for me doesnt really matter lets discuss about the food.  I had the Jerk Chicken + Oxtail combo came up to $14.20 tax in; no drink. (extremely pricey for what its worth! I can get the same combo else where in town for $13 with a drink!) The coleslaw is so generic it doesnt even look home made looks like something you would buy in bulk at nofrills and tastes just as such. The chicken were the small chinsy pieces with more bone than meat. The Ox-Tail was no surprise that it was just all bone with little meat on it. (its a joke compared to top dog paces like Gem's or Portland Jerk) The rice and peas were definitely not fresh and from my 2 minute drive back to my office it was already soggy and had little taste to it. All in all I would NEVER eat here again I believe Tara Y's review is way more accurate and I have uploaded pictures so you can judge for yourself."}
