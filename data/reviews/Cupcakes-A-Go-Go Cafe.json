{"text":"The concept is actually pretty neat. I just don't really like the cupcakes that much. If you are a cupcake fan at any level, this place can be heaven. Maybe with a little time the selection will improve, but at a single moment there are only so many varieties. There were some creative ones but they were still semi-standard. Ex: add alcohol. I think they also have specials day to day which is a huge plus, but unfortunately I can't eat cupcakes every day.

I personally would have liked to see a chocolate cupcake that looked like chocolate was a central component to the integrity of the cake. But heck that might be what separates cake from brownies. 

The cupcakes are worth ordering and when I went there were indeed an impressive number of cupcakes. Because this is a new place, I am sure they will appreciate regulars. You might also want to check to see if they will do custom cupcakes/cupcake orders, because that certainly could be a possibility."}
{"text":"Never disappoints, always wows! I highly recommend the champagne cake pop :)"}
{"text":"We weren't really sure what the hype was about. We we're looking forward to it based on the reviews, but what we found were cupcakes that looked like my mom made 30 years ago from a .99 cent Betty Crocker mix. They didn't taste better either. Since when are they supposed to be cold too? The case, general storefront and bathroom were all dirty. To top it off the $3 per cupcake was the \"icing on the cake\". Speaking of the cake, it was dry. Nothing felt, looked or tasted special. Presentation is half the battle, right? The customer service was good, hence the two stars and not one."}
{"text":"The frosting is cream cheese.  I hate cream cheese. No where on their display does it say cream cheese frosting.  It's suppose to be buttercream!!!"}
{"text":"I wished I have found this place earlier! Being a Friday my friend and I decided to go to Cupcakes-A-Go-Go Cafe to try out some of their stuff after hearing some nice comments from another friend. We were not disappointed! So far I have tried their macarons (vanilla, chocolate, mango, raspberry and salted bourbon caramel) and cupcakes (chocolate espresso truffle, red velvet with pomegranate, oreo, french vanilla strawberry and tiramisu). 

I really like the vanilla macarons (you can taste the vanilla beans in them!) and their mango macarons (the mango is so rich, which kept me wondering if there were real mangoes in the fillings). Their cupcakes are super good and very different from what I'd had so far. The frosting blends in with the cupcakes that it feels so natural to have the frosting with the cake. I have never finished the entire frosting on my cupcakes prior to this, either because they are too sweet or too much. So this is really awesome for me.

Their cupcakes are not the cheapest, you can get cheaper ones downtown Madison. But I will be back again for more of my favorites, and try a couple of others that I didn't get to today, such as their black forest cupcakes!! Btw, their cupcakes are buy 12 get 1 free, you don't have to get all 12 at one go, it's cumulative, either use their mobile app, or a punch card to keep records. And there are special offers for checking in as well! This is a Friday afternoon well-spent =)"}
{"text":"I haven't been TO this cafe, but I had a cupcake from here and it was delicious! It was just white with vanilla frosting and sprinkles, but it was so perfect looking and tasted exactly like your fondest memories of childhood Birthday cakes. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great cupcakes here!  Absolutely amazing owners who listen to their customers and their feedback.  They are always looking and try new creative ideas too!  I'm a health nut and these are the perfect portion size to help the cravings subside.  I plan on coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at this cute little cafe, the first time I was there from all the cupcakes I had I really loved their black forest cupcakes so why not to try some other flavors once again. I got a champagne one (I tried it before) , a turtle one with nuts on top and of course some black forest ones. I had to say they were all really good, very moist and the frosting of the champagne one was right on point, the turtle was new for me and usually that word is associated to very sweet because of the caramel but this was not the case, which I really liked, I could taste the caramel tones but it was not overpowering and the nuts were nice and crunchy. For the black forest, all I have to say is that if you love chocolate and cherries, this is a sin made in heaven ;) I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Visited about a week ago. I was needing a sugar fix and the store is near where I do my errands. Store is smaller than I expected, might need a few cosmetic upgrades (just a fresh coat of paint since the walls were chipped noticeably from chairs and tables). 
The cupcakes I bought were very very yummy. I crave more all the time. Anytime I'm on the west side I have to coach myself to not stop in and buy every cupcake in their case. 
They are a little pricey,  however I hope this means they are able to profit. So many cupcakeries have been unable to stay afloat in a competitive market these days. You cannot get the quality of cupcakes they make in a store! I absolutely love baking and  wish I was as good as the bakers at Cupcakes a go-go! 
I'll be stopping back by again soon."}
{"text":"When I called the morning of - admittedly late notice - to request delivery of a dozen cupcakes for a friend's birthday, I was told they would do it, but because they wanted the business and could \"squeeze it in\". I gave them multiple \"outs\", but they insisted it was OK, although the rest of the conversation was hurried and unpleasant. I gave them all the information they requested, and was told the delivery would take place during a time window. Great. Not delightful as far as business interactions go, but certainly fine so far. Plus online reviews raved about their cupcakes, so I was willing to accept some mediocre service if the end product was good.

During the window of delivery, I get a call saying that they don't know how to get in the building and the \"info\" booth line is too long for them to wait in.

Now, a few things: 1) I told them I was an out of towner that morning, 2) I told them it was a surprise and that they would be delivering to my friend's workplace.

I was asked if I could call my friend (no, I could not, she was in a meeting) or if I knew any of her coworkers (no, I would have had them help out if I knew any of them-also, did I mention I'm an out of stater? Yes, yes I did). Then the employee got silent, and then outwardly and vocally frustrated. With me, his customer. 

10 minutes later, he called back (at my request, mind you) to say it was easy and everything was delivered. All he had to do was wait in line.

Here's the thing: if you knew you couldn't do this, then DO NOT overextend yourself. I offered them multiple \"outs\" and alternatives not only when I first called but also when I was called -during 9-5 work hours, mind you - to fix a delivery situation a local businessman put himself into willingly.

It was a stressful situation for me, and I felt - at multiple points in the day - that I was an annoyance to them, a hindrance to their normal daily business. 

I certainly hope the cupcakes were as delicious as reviews said, although I'm not sure they will be tasty enough to ever wash this bitter taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's a cozy little shop; very clean with friendly employees. So far I've tried the hummingbird, peanut butter and mint chocolate cookie cupcakes. They're all very good but I recommend the mint chocolate cookie one most. 

My friend bought a few macaroons. I'd say they were alright but I've had better. So if you decide to go, definitely go for the cupcakes."}
{"text":"The chocolate chip cookie dough cupcake made my day. Very friendly staff, nice local shop!
I love sweets and I love scratch baking. I could taste the butter and vanilla in the cake, the frosting was perfectly (not overly) sweet. 
I spend my calories and money carefully, and I found these cupcakes to be a wonderful indulgence."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but that wasn't the case. Cake was dense and heavy but my main complaint was the frosting. I ordered their basic chocolate cupcake, pumpkin, cherry vanilla and triple chocolate ... They all had the same tasting frosting which tasted like cream cheese, heavy cream cheese, needless to say not a fan. You would think out of all those cupcakes there would be a tasty one in the bunch. I hope they can take some advice and change it up a little with light fluffy cake and light creamy and sweet frosting."}
{"text":"Wade and Laura are great.  They did the cupcakes for our wedding and 5 months later still know our names.  The cupcakes are really good, the folks the run the place are really nice and they do a really great job making you feel welcome.  What else do you want in your cupcake joint?"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to have a red velvet cuppie from Cupcakes a Go-Go just once. It was a year ago and it has haunted me since. Being from so far away (Hawaii) from their location (Madison, WI), it's difficult to simply stop by and get a cuppie fix. So I have searched every cupcakery in Hawaii to find a cuppie that can match the heaven that I tasted with CAGG. 

Nothing even comes close. And this distresses me. Because I might have to jump on a plane to taste that red velvet cupcake -- with its delicious undertones and velvety texture -- ever again. 

You cannot go wrong with a cuppie from CAGG. They are hands down the best cupcakery."}
{"text":"The cupcakes are very delicious, and pleasing to look at. The staff is very firendly
Cupcakes are the PERFECT size.....not like some of the giant ones you find elsewhere. The homemade POP TARTS are to die for, as are the pumpkin cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"So many positive things. 
Number one: GLUTEN FREE cupcakes! They are so amazing. Best gluten free cupcakes I have ever had. Especially the flourless chocolate one. OOOOO. I am glad I don't live too close (it's a few miles) otherwise I would be getting obese.
Number two: Amazing number of choices of flavors (even for gluten free ones!) and they are all good!
Number three: Great service. And the owner (at least I think he was the owner) is the nicest guy who really cares about customer service and really listens. 
Number four: This goes back to the gluten free thing, but they are working on expanding their gluten free repertoire! YAY

All around a really great business :)"}
{"text":"Excellent selection and kind, patient service.   Patiently waiting til we could figure out which ones to get."}
{"text":"I agree with a previous reviewer, the cupcakes were ok, but nothing special.  The combinations were interesting, actual cake flavor was good but the frosting was lacking.  A couple of the cupcakes had cream cheese frosting, which I normally don't mind, but wouldn't expect on a cupcake unless I was ordering a carrot cupcake.  

I was also a bit put off by the price.  They are charging the same price as cupcake shops in larger cities, that typically offer larger cupcakes with much better visual presentation (both the cupcake & carryout box)."}
{"text":"Best cupcakes in town! Love them. Great customer service."}
{"text":"A must-try bakery on Madison's west side. Located in the same strip mall off of Mineral Point as Joey's Seafood Grill and Rosati's, this stylish and cute bakery is one of my very favorites. 

They have special offerings all the time, including bars, pumpkin cinnamon rolls, macaroons, and cake pops, but their cupcakes are what I come in for. Moist, flavorful, and just the right amount of frosting, unlike Gigi's. The black forest cupcake is my mainstay, which has actual whipped cream frosting and a quality cherry filling. I'd recommend  the red velvet as well, which has a touch of pomegranate flavor. Plus they have booze-inspired flavors like the Irish Trifecta, the White Russian, and champagne-can't go wrong here.

I've had them make custom Hunger Games cupcakes for a friend's birthday, and even the regular lemon flavor was a knock-out. I'll be working with them again."}
{"text":"Just YUMMY!  Our favorites are the mint chocolate and red velvet. Easy location.  Good hours."}
{"text":"For the past month, I have been here four times already.
Being a student in Chicago, I have been exposed to great cupcake-ries like Sprinkles and Magnolia. I do have to say, this place is quite good.
The amount of frosting is just right, and the cake is super moist.

So far, I tried the Red velvet with pomegranate, Creme Brûlée, Tiramisu, Chocolate Espresso-truffle, and S'mores cupcakes. My brother LOVES the Creme Brûlée cupcake, so I make sure to get at least one when I go.

If I do have to point out one small criticism, the cake of the Red velvet with pomegranate can be a little soggy, but all in all, the touch of fruity pomegranate is great with the cupcake.

DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"The cupcakes I've had from Cupcakes-A-Go-Go were... fine.  I wasn't amazed at how delicious they were - the cake was pretty good (especially the chocolate), but the frosting was nothing to write home about.  There wasn't enough frosting and the frosting that was there wasn't anything special.  I didn't enjoy the champagne cupcake - the flavor just wasn't what I was hoping for and I didn't finish it.  Overall, my impression was that the cupcakes were just \"okay.\""}
{"text":"We used Cupcakes-A-Go-Go for our wedding. The cupcakes were exceptionally delicious and beautiful, and CAGG was a pleasure to work with. Delivery and setup was right on time, the cupcakes looked perfect, and our guests devoured them with gusto. We found the cupcakes to be of exceptional value, especially when compared to other bakers in the Madison area. I cannot recommend Cupcakes-A-Go-Go highly enough! Thinking about cupcakes for your wedding? Don't hesitate. Book with Cupcakes-A-Go-Go now."}
{"text":"Love your minicakes!...you are NOT afraid of bold flavors and that's what we want! Such a nice and helpful young person at the counter. Also, Lemon Bars."}
{"text":"I used this bakery for my wedding. I was planning my wedding from out of town so I was unable to come in person for a consultation. Their communication was fabulous. They were very open to my ideas and produced exactly what I asked for. Their prices were very reasonable. Thanks a bunch!"}
{"text":"I have gotten cupcakes from here since we moved to town in 2011.  I love their variety and the fact that they don't put 4 inches of frosting on top.  We also try and support local businesses as much as possible.  

I have always picked up my cupcakes in store and decided to try delivery for a business meeting for work.  We had our executive team in Madison from Chicago and they were really looking forward to having a Chocolate Bacon Maple Whiskey cupcake.  I placed the order online and called to follow up and pay with a credit card over the phone and to make sure they could be delivered between 9:30 and 10:30 a.m. like I specified on the online delivery form.  They said that it was no problem!

  By 1:00 (at the conclusion of our meeting that started at 11, hence the delivery time notice) there will still no sign of cupcakes.  I called and they said that the were very busy today (which I understand, it being so close to Valentine's Day) and that they should be there within the next 5-10 minutes.  Just before 3:00 they were finally delivered, almost 5 hours after they said we would have them.  While we were very excited that they had come and we could enjoy them, we were very disappointed that the sole purpose of us ordering them (for our meeting with the executive team from Chicago) for our event today had passed and the executive team had left to head back to Chicago.  

I find it upsetting that a place that delivers for a variety of holidays and events cannot deliver on time, or even close to on time - regardless if it's a holiday or not.  I can't imagine if it was a birthday party or something really special and they show up 5 hours late after everyone has left.  

We will continue to buy cupcakes from Cupcakes A Go Go in store, but I will never order delivery from them.  Unfortunately this event has left everyone in our office feeling the same way - unreliable delivery service.  

Very disappointed with our experience today, but at least the cupcakes were still good."}
{"text":"I am like a total cupcake connoisseur lol....after reading raving reviews, I decided to check it out. I got the red velvet and an turtle. I have to admit it was nothing special. Maybe I came in on a bad day but it tasted like it was days old not fresh. My bff had a couple of champagne cupcakes and it was ok...idk for the price you would think it would be better....maybe I will try again but idk"}
{"text":"Cupcakes-A-Go-Go are by far the best in Madison.  There are a variety of creative flavors so something for everyone.  They also don't overdo it on the frosting like a lot of fancy cupcake places.  My personal favorite is the Tiramisu, but also really like the Peanut Butter Cup, Oreo and Creme Brulee.  Their breakfast goods are also great.  I've had the homemade pop-tarts and French Toast muffin and loved both."}
{"text":"I just bought and finished eating a banana pudding cupcake and I just had to jump on here and insta-5 star them. 

This may have been the best cupcake I've ever had, oh my god. It hit me excellently on smell, texture, and taste. Just amazing!"}
{"text":"I am so glad this place is closed. Their food cart came to my work one time and I got the sloppiest looking cupcakes I've ever seen. I've made much better ones from a box! They tasted like notebook paper. A total waste of money"}
{"text":"So... we walked in, unknowingly, 30 minutes before they opened and the guy at the counter told us, we apologized, but he was so nice he turned on the lights and let us get some cupcakes!
It was great because we had to get to work, and we had just come from a very dissappointing food experience.

He bantered with us the whole time and was really enjoyable to talk to. The atmosphere is cute there, and you can tell the cupcakes are hand made to be gormet and appreciated.

We got macaroons, perfect texture and delish! Also, we got cupcakes that look and smell amazing as well, tasty! This made our day. Thanks cupcake dude. :3"}
{"text":"I just came back here again since I'm in town, and I gotta say, this place is great. We came in late, they still had plenty of cupcakes and flavors left. The cashier was super friendly and told us about some freshly frosted cupcakes behind the counter. 

The cupcakes themselves are super moist, there's not too much frosting or too little. I'll stop in whenever I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Great service. Called in to see if they had any other gluten-free cupcakes besides the flour-less chocolate base. When I explained it was for a graduation a week away- I was told that they had a gluten-free cookbook and a week was enough time to experiment and develop a GF Carrotcake cupcake (my original request).I'm looking forward to seeing how they turn out."}
{"text":"Very convenient hours, super friendly too! Perfect for a last minute desert for a dinner party I was heading too.  Everyone loved them."}
{"text":"First thing I love about Cupcakes-A-Go-Go?? They are open until EIGHT on the weekends. This is perfect for all those late night cupcake cravings.  Well, maybe eight is only late if you are the mother of three small children. So yes...let me rephrase...this is perfect for all those mid-evening cupcake cravings!

We stopped by Cupcakes-A-Go-Go last Saturday night about about 7:40 and they had a plethora of available flavors. To me this is good AND bad.  Good, because it means that there is more for me to choose from. Bad because it means they are clearly not the type of shop that makes all their cupcakes fresh in the morning and keep them out until they sell out.  It makes me wonder, on the average, how long they DO sit out - are most made the day of? Just wondering...

As for the cupcakes themselves, well, I will review each one individually because I feel like they were all pretty different.  Here is the order I tried them. (For the record, I did not eat these all myself, I did share...a little.) ;)

1. Mint Oreo: This was the first one I tried, and I was very impressed. The cake was moist and dense with excellent flavor. The frosting was their \"traditional\" cream cheese based frosting (which I know only from reading other Yelp reviews) and it fit the cupcake well. It was also thick and dense and complimented the cake perfectly. This one was great. :)

2. Lemon Meringue: I was expecting a nice zesty lemon cupcake. I was disappointed. The cake was a bit dry and the flavor just so-so. The meringue frosting tasted fine. I was pretty underwhelmed.

3. Peanut Butter Cookie Dough: I was SO excited for this cupcake. I was SO let down. The cake was very, very dry.  The chunk of cookie dough in the middle was hard. The frosting was the cream cheese based frosting again, which just didn't fit with the rest of it. It did not feel like a cohesive dessert.  None of worked together. It was not good. Bummer.

4. Black Forest: First of all - this cupcake looked incredible. It was like the picture-perfect cupcake with it's chocolate cake, white whipped frosting, and a cherry on top. And, I'm happy to report that it tasted even better than it looked!! The cake was just right - sweet, moist, melted in my mouth.  The cherries were tasty and didn't feel like they came from a can. The whipped topping was just like grandma makes - not super sweet and made of fresh whipping cream. The entire thing my my trip to Cupcakes-A-Go-Go worth it.  THIS is what I hoped all my cupcakes would be.

I also purchased a Strawberries and Cream cupcake and a German Chocolate cupcake, but I was far too generous and gave those to my in-laws. What was I thinking?!  

Part of me wants to give this place 3 stars - because only half of the cupcakes I tried were awesome - one was the opposite of awesome.  However, I think I will go with 4.  Really good, but could use some improvements.  I have now am halfway to a free cupcake (Buy 12 get one free - which is great because you don't have to buy all 12 at one time!), so I will definitely be back to try some more. Hopefully the next ones will wow me and force me to add that last star!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Their cupcakes are top-notch and the staff is always friendly. I have gotten a few custom orders from them for my birthday and graduation, and they did an amazing job. Admittedly, they did totally miss one of my orders and it was not ready when I went to pick it up, but they had it ready for me within the same day and gave it to me for free because of this. Incredible customer service and incredibly talented bakers!"}
{"text":"I helped my son move to Madison in August from Pittsburgh, and I wanted to send him something for his October birthday. I found Cupcakes-A-Go-Go online, and ordered from their website. They called back for my credit card info and to know when I actually wanted them delivered. They couldn't have been nicer, and though I had read online that they no longer delivered on Saturdays, they told me that they could do exactly that with no problem. My son was so surprised, and told me they were phenomenal AND beautiful to look at.

Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Delicious cupcakes. I particularly like the pumpkin"}
{"text":"Definitely delicious!  I have been told to try this place out over and over.  Then it happened!  I checked in on Yelp and noticed Cupcakes A Go Go came up.  What could that mean????  Of course!  I was finally in the neighborhood to try it out.

I am obsessed with banana bread.  I tried their banana cupcake...yum!  It was a whole lot of banana. The custard in the middle was perfect.  The cake was fluffy without being too dense.  The crumble on top was the perfect compliment to the soft cake.  All sorts of delish!

They also have doggie cupcakes.  I think my dog also gave the place a 5-star rating.

I purchased an Oreo cupcake and two peanut butter cupcakes.  I shared the love for these but I can tell you they were well received.  

The counter person was so friendly and informative.  My purchase was quick and easy.  They have to go containers that hold the cupcakes nicely.  No tip overs on the way home!"}
{"text":"Oh man. Laura's cupcakes are unbelievably great! Moist, sweet but not too sweet, with really innovative and delicious flavor combinations. I wish she was in Chicago though ... on second thought, best she's *not* in Chicago otherwise I'd be there every week!"}
{"text":"Guys. GUYS.

They have a crème brûlée cupcake. Do I need to say more than that?

Edit: Apparently, I DO need to say more than that. I honestly thought the words 'crème brûlée' and 'cupcake' would be enough to entice any Yelpers who may read this review. (Isn't \"crème brûlée\" French for \"I love you and want you to be happy\"?) Anyway, the crème filled the center of the vanilla cupcake and pooled over the top, and was perfectly burnt and crispy. The heavier cake was perfect--and necessary, really, otherwise I imagine the crème would just fall out the bottom of the cupcake, which would be a tragedy (if you couldn't catch the cupcake bits with your face)."}
{"text":"Cute little bakery with very interesting cupcake flavors.  They usually have a free sample out and the counter staff is always very helpful.  The cupcakes themselves are tasty, if a bit small, and always very moist.  Good amount of frosting, not too much and not too sugary."}
{"text":"Their cupcakes have been at many events I have attended. Moist, not too sweet frosting with well balanced flavor combinations. i like the bite size ones cause its just the right amount and lets you try multiple flavors. I have yet to have the chance to go to there shop."}
{"text":"We have been going to CCAGG since we moved to Madison two plus years ago. They are my wife's FAVORITE sweet place ever. 

The owners are just about the nicest store owners I have ever met. Always a smile. Always fresh cupcakes. Always something new. 

We are now moving to California. This is the one place we will miss. I even inquired about shipping cupcakes to California. Next I will try to convince them to open another branch in Orange County. Start packing Laura. We will convince your hubby yet. 

Please try their sweets. Awesome. Tell them Chaz sent you."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something about these cupcakes and the heart and SOUL that goes into them! First of all, I have never met more passionate and hard working people in my life - Laura and Wade - you are amazing! But way beyond that, and coming from someone who is not even a \"sweet\" person, I CRAVE these incredible cupcakes! I see a Facebook picture and I speed there the make sure I get what they are serving because I don't want to miss out. E-V-E-R! There is no comparison. None. Local. Hard workers. THE BEST. Period. If you don't stop by this beautiful establishment, you are simply missing out. :o)))"}
{"text":"I wrote a previous review of Cupcakes-A-Go-Go that was a bit harsh and this is my make up review.   Though my first impression of the store was not what I had hoped, I can say that the cupcakes were very good and reasonably priced and the service was good.
I recently found out that they use local ingredients whenever possible which is always a plus in my book.  
I had both the cheesecake and the cupcakes and they were both very good.
There isn't a lot of room to sit down so it is best to order to go but there are tables and chairs for about 10 people or so.
I am looking forward to seeing this business grow and become a really great go-to bakery in the area which we all know we desperately need."}
{"text":"Hands down best champagne cupcake I have ever had! The other cupcakes I've sampled are good, but not as good as the champagne, which is rolled in crystal sugar and has cream cheese frosting. If I were rating only the one flavor they would get 5 stars. Alas, the black forest and others are 4 star cupcakes. :)

Their store is cute and has a retro vibe to it. The owners are very nice and will answer any questions you have."}
{"text":"This is, easily, the best cupcake shop in Madison!  Why is it so good?  Their cupcakes are creative, artistic, tasty and unique, and, importantly, they have a perfectly proportioned, reasonable amount of frosting.   These cupcakes will not leave you feeling like you just ate four pounds of sugar and a little cake.  The frosting (and other toppings) complement the cake in flavor and texture, leaving a cupcake that you can enjoy from the first to the last bite."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite dessert stop in Madison. The cupcakes and flavor options are great. The frosting to cupcake ratio, in my opinion, is on point. 

The only reason I dock it a star is because info think they're a little $$$. If they would offer more specials (beside the student discount), that would put them over 5 stars!

The store itself is a little small, but very nicely decorated. The staff is super nice! I definitely recommend stopping in and trying some delicious cupcakes!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to the shop on a week day in the morning to discuss having a wedding cake done with them and to set up a tasting. They handed me a brochure and told me to look things up online. They told me to fill out their online form, which I did when I got home. I met Wade at the store and he said they were available on my wedding date. BUT I have not heard back from them! I received an email receipt for my online form request saying they'd get back to me in 48 hours... It's been exactly 2 weeks and ivd heard nothing. Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"I used to buy cupcakes once a week 
So I ordered my husband superhero cake in July 
I took my cake on Sunday . It's so disappointed 
The cake is very bad 
It's not fresh at all , look like put refrigerator a while 
Inside side is very hard , even hard to cut and taste weird , Outside superman decorations is wet 

I called them next day to complaint about our cake and asked them when they made this cake , they told me that they made on Friday . And apology to me 
They are going to send me gift card 

A month later , I still did not get any thing from them 

Gift card is simple thing for me , just don't understand  why they treat customers like this 

Give me bad cake and break the things they promise me 


I will not get in this store any more"}
{"text":"We went here with our 2 kids. The young man behind the counter was super friendly and helpful!  He even gave us a free cupcake that was messed up while decorating.  We each had a different cupcake. And they were all really good and moist. I had the peanut butter one that was stuffed with a peanut butter cup yum yum!  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"it all started a year ago, when i arbitrarily ordered a dozen cupcakes online for my sister's bday from Providence and her then-boyfriend proposed that same week.  as she bridezilla'ed all over Madtown in the ensuing months, i casually and manipulatively suggested the two of them consider cupcakes for their wedding instead of a traditional wedding cake.  4 months later--after a friendly, professional, and honest consultation w/Wade who remained helpful and available throughout the process--we're sitting on her kitchen floor amongst strewn cupcake wrappers, soaking in our own filth, painfully closing out a destructive but unlamented 2-day tasting binge where these guys came out on top.  

her wedding day: memorable for 200 Midwesterners in various stages of inebriation toasting the happy couple w/cupcakes in hand, winning flavors clearly creme brulee and peanut butter overdrive~"}
{"text":"Best cupcakes ever. The seasonal pumpkin cupcake is yumm !! Ever since I tried these, I stopped taking or liking cupcakes from anywhere else :) 
these are even better than the famous sprinkles in Chicago along with the advantage of not standing in queue for an hour.. That's a bonus !"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I was mistaken about the prices, the cupcakes are actually in the $2-3 range. Laura, the manager, contacted me after seeing my review, and offered to send me a gift card to try some non-cake items that they offer (french macaroons, etc). Gotta appreciate owners who care about the customers, I'll happily add a star for that!"}
{"text":"I'm a baker myself and I have high standards for cakes, so I thought I'd check it out myself after finding out that it's voted as Madison's BEST bakery. I was disappointed with the place, nothing much going on including the display case with only few cupcakes to choose from. My family ordered three different flavors so I got to taste each. Good thing the cupcakes live up to their reputation. They're dense but moist with sufficient frosting that's not overpowering with sweetness. I was looking forward to trying out the macarons but there was only one kind left, so I didn't bother. Service is good though."}
{"text":"Just not impressed at all. I've tried this place four times and have been incredibly disappointed each time. The cake is very dry and lacking in flavor (at least the chocolate and vanilla were not good). The strawberry whipped filling was really yummy (hence the 2 stars). The price is way too high for smaller-than-average \"gourmet\" cupcakes. I'm not sure \"gourmet\" is the right word for these. Won't be trying a fifth time..."}

{"text":"Don't blink or you'll drive right past it. Tucked into a strip mall off Mineral Point Rd, Cupcakes-A-Go-Go is much smaller than I anticipated. The shop is quaint with simply one bakery case, and even the cupcakes were closer to your average, homemade size, unlike the excessively monstrous cupcakes you'd expect of a bakery. The concept of get in, get your cupcake, and get out, worked for me. But of course if you feel inclined to stay, there is a bit of seating and the workers are hospitable. 

As this was my first time in, I asked the man working the counter for their most popular flavors and he shared that the Chocolate Espresso, Banana Pudding (his favorite), and Oreo were their best-sellers. Though I'm usually a chocoholic, the Banana Pudding cupcake was speaking to me. I pulled out my 50% off a cupcake deal on the Yelp app and left the shop.

The frosting of the Banana Pudding cupcake was my favorite part. It was certainly more like whipped cream rather than a heavy sugary frosting and I appreciated the lightness. The cake itself, however, was disappointingly cold, dry and boring. While the batter was marked by banana veins, the flavor and texture were lacking in uniqueness. I was pleasantly surprised by the banana pudding core, which served to moisten and flavor up the dull cake. Though I expected more from Cupcakes-A-Go-Go's execution, the filling and frosting were the only high notes. 

I'm glad to have finally made it to the shop, but the lack of freshness has shown that I can try out their other flavors from the closer locales of grocery stores they sell at for the same quality. And while I was disappointed with this first cupcake, I will most likely give another flavor a shot."}
{"text":"I agree that these are hands down the best cupcakes in Madison! I especially love the apple crisp cupcake with the cream cheese frosting. I ordered a birthday cake there (chocolate with a sea salt caramel filling topped with chocolate) and after having a bite was in heaven! My guests proclaimed it the best cake ever and everyone wanted some to take home which I reluctantly let them:)  Their shop is gorgeous and inviting and the customer service is so personal that I visit more than I should. The flavor combinations are creative and you can tell that everything is made from scratch in house. Don't pass up the pumpkin cinnamon rolls- they are addicting!!!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to write the review! We came to buy their cupcakes five minutes before the store was closed. Was so close! 
I was with my hubby, my Japanese friend and my Wisconsin friend from Marshfield who's been visiting Madison for few times but had no idea about this place. I told her that the champagne cupcake was recommended by a number of yelpers, so she had that. My hubby got a creme brûlée, and so did my Japanese friend. I got the banana cupcake and the tiramisu one. Hubby loved his. I didn't get to try it but he said: oh this is good. The amount of sweetness is just right! And I was glad to hear that.
My friend who is a big fan of cupcakes said she likes her champagne cupcake,but her favorite one was the banana. As I can't have anything with alcohol, I didn't try the champagne but I loved both the tiramisu and banana equally. They both are equally delish. We'll def. come back for more! Thank you for making our Saturday night as sweet as your tiramisu cupcake!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not yet reviewed this place.  I was buying cupcakes from them when I had to travel to Sun Prairie to do so.  The cupcakes are always fresh and moist, the best in town.  Maybe it is because I am more of a cake than frosting person, but I do not need frosting piled 6 inches high.  I am much happier to have a quality cupcake with some good frosting and Cupcakes A Go-Go never disappoints.  Two of my favorites are Chocolate Caramel Sea Salt and the Creme Brulee.  They always have seasonal flavors too.  Besides the yummy cupcakes, Wade and Laura are two of the nicest business owners I have ever known.  Whenever I stop in they come out from the kitchen to say hello.  If you ever are disappointed or have a bad experience they are right there to make it right.  You could not find two nicer people!  I realize as I am writing this it has been way too long since I have stopped in, need to put that on my to do list for this weekend.  Try them, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The guys at Cupcakes a go go really came through for me today!  It was my daughters birthday and us being out of state makes it difficult to pull off those little surprises.  Unfortunately I called late but they made it happen and got 12 beautiful cupcakes delivered ON her birthday!   She was thrilled and really appreciated what thy had put together.  Thanks Cupcakes-a-go-go!"}
