{"text":"It's a decent neighborhood bar. Staff are friendly and know your name after being there twice. The menu is limited, but the food is well prepared. They're installing new draft machines, it's been bottles only for a week, but the staff are very attentive so you won't go thirsty. It's super hard to find, the sign is just \"db\", you'll see the four table patio more easily. Yelp's map is kind of misleading, it's actually on the east side of 36th, just north of the all day breakfast joint in the strip mall."}
{"text":"myself and my bestie went here a couple months back. IT WAS DELICIOUS. The Food was served on really nice plates in nice presentation. We both enjoyed the food it was flavorfull and unique to this location. The owner was also really nice! Thanks Guys !"}
{"text":"Surprise! It looks like another potentially good bar in this location closed down. The food was good, and the service was hit and miss.  The thing is managers and owners seemed to wanna be more patrons then run the place. Hopefully the next place may last."}
