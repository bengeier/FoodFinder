{"text":"Great quality food that is hand made. I travel extensively all over north American and rank this with the top."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the deli foods yet, but we did stop by one evening for ice cream.  The selection of ice cream was limited to basically vanilla or chocolate.  I would like to see a much larger selection of ice cream type treats especially since we're in the middle of summer.  I'll update my review once I've tried the deli items.  Thanks."}
{"text":"I did not eat anything here (yet) so keep that in mind.  I visited because I saw an ad in the local paper. I wanted something homemade to eat and I definitely wanted to support a new, family owned business.  I was disappointed and ended up leaving without buying anything.  First, the layout (to me) is off. They could make better use of the space.  I identified baked goods in the front case, but their presentation was not appealing. To my right I discovered the deli case which was about 60% full...which gave me a feeling of old, random. I looked more closely at the meats hoping for high end brands (e.g. boars head) but didn't recognize anything. The prepared cutlets and salads were heavily wrapped in Saran Wrap...it was like peering in someone's refrigerator at their leftovers.   I turned my attention to the sandwich board and saw prices starting at about $8 for a sub...then looking back at the case of random meats, I contemplated buying a loaf of bread and taking it home to make toast.  There was a sign listing breakfast sandwiches, and I thought...perfect! I asked the young girl if they were still making the sandwiches and she stood frozen, mouth open, unable or unwilling to speak. Her eyes were the size of quarters. Just as I was beginning to worry that there was something very wrong with this young lady, the friendly older woman came over to assist me. Well, actually to pick up/remove the breakfast sandwich sign and tell me \"no\", they are not making those sandwiches.  There was one couple in the store while I was there. Yet there was this air of frantic busyness. Maybe the back is staffed with people filling loads of catering or takeout orders.  All in all, a bizarre and somewhat uncomfortable experience. I will give it one more shot, but like the other reviewer wrote...what is their core competency? What are they trying to be? It was all so disoriented and unfocused. A little of this, a little of that."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and will continue coming back. If you're looking for fast food dollar menu prices this place may not be for you. I just ate a sandwich called the Newburian which is a BLT with fried egg. It was delicious and I would highly recommend it. I wish there were more of these types of places. I would definitely recommend stopping in if you're hungry."}
