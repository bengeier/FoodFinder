{"text":"Perfect little Italian eatery. Comfortable for a casual dinner, a romantic date, as well as a drink at the bar to watch \"the game\" on tv. Warm and cozy in the cold months with a great patio when the warm weather arrives. Love their bread and oil. You can't go wrong with the menu, but the calzones are one of their most popular items. And the lemon ice cream dessert is a dream conclusion to any meal."}
{"text":"A great and authentic Italian restaurant on 185th. Service is welcoming, courteous, and accommodating. Their patio looks awesome also. Props to their rooftop garden"}
{"text":"Extremely slow. Took over one hour for us to get our food , and the restaurant was basically empty. We were a group of 4 , and 3 of us ordered salads . One ordered a small pizza. I don't think it is that hard to make some salads and a small pizza. Very disappointed. They only accept cash as payment, they don't do separate checks. You can go to the counter and pay one by one. Very inconvenient and frustrating. The waitress had to recalculate our individual bills 3 times. The food was great."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  One waitress is nice and cute as hell.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and very good prices.. Place smells great! FYI they only take cash. Very good wine as well."}
{"text":"A truly fantastic Italian restaurant. 

Everything here is delicious! Eggplant fries, pasta, pizza, calzones, desserts, whatever. Nice casual atmosphere, great service, reasonable priced, yummy yummy food! I will drive across town for a meal here. 

Go to the ATM beforehand, because it's cash only."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Lots of sauces to choose from. Cash only. Nice wooded decor with an open kitchen. Nice back patio too!"}
{"text":"carb heaven, please widen the door so i can officially be rolled out....

Scotti's is always consistently down to earth, cozy, no fuss Italian food. So if you like that kind of thing (a warm fuzzy feeling brought on by copious amounts of pasta, cream sauce and chianti) for sure check it out.

If Bucca di Beppe originated by ripping off a place - it was probably Scotti's. It has that kind of feel, but with out the requisite \"flair\". Thank god. Homemade bread - hot, fresh with dipping sauce. They dont even mind that I untop the parmesean cheese shaker and mix with the oil & vinegar (try it!). But the gluttony doesn't stop there....first add wine: nice little wine list with some good inexpensive basics. Come on, get a chianti!! Then you must pick your pasta... the man had the lobster stuffed ravioli which came out tricolored, very cool and very yum, especially with the alfredo. 
Me, linguine with the red pepper pesto (oh god is it good) with a side of alfredo. You can never have enough cheese. Repeat, there is never enough cheese!! 

They give you a huge portion, and believe me, take the leftovers home. I put the fork down shortly before they had to unhinge the door,. Stuffed and happy, like a ricotta shell..... and an hour later at home? Well, lets say there was a fork fight to the finish :)"}
{"text":"My family loves Scotti!!!!
 The staff is very nice and the owner always ask if we need anything. The food is GREAT and  priced right. The bread that they have is AWESOME!! I LOVE that place. The only thing I would say negative is that they only accept cash, and the decor is a little outdated. But I have been to beautiful restaurants inside and either the people are nasty, the food overpriced, or  the food doesnt taste good, I have never had any of those problems at Scotti. Its WORTH THE DRIVE, all the way from the westside. My daughter LOVES coming here, and everyone is friendly. After my daughter therapy tonight we are going there for dinner. Keep up the good work!!!

{"text":"Our party of 8 \"fish fry gang\" all had a great meal last night! 2 of us had the scallop fettuccine,  which was great! Scallops were tender and considering the cost of scallops, dish was reasonably priced. Hubby had the Sunday dinner..a little taste of everything..great meatballs! Fish, salmon was great .bread with oil and Italian seasoning ...perfect...only complaints were fries were burnt and it was so uncomfortably HOT in there! Had to be 85 degrees  and had to take most of my pasta home to enjoy it in a cool environment!  Also..it is VERY LOUD when there is a full house..so if u are looking for a quiet romantic restaurant..this is not the place to go..I will be back for pizza and Pinot on the patio!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and fantastic service. I make it a point to eat here when I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Scotti's is a staple of the Euclid/Colinwood/VASJ community and the two words that describe it best to me are pizza and patio. Scotti's has some of the tastiest pizza and calzones around, and that is just a fact, Google it. Every Monday is half price pizza night, dine-in only, thank me lster. It also has a large outdoor patio in the back with beautiful flowers that just make the wine more delicious in the summer somehow. 

In addition to the patio and pizza, Scotti's has a solid wine list, a bunch of scrumptious apps, a diverse selection of salads and some of my favorite Italian classics that are also available thru carryout. My wife swears by their chicken parm, and the tri-color cheese ravioli is my number one ravioli ever. The spinach salad with warm pepperoni dressing and the zucchini fries would be my recommendations for top salad and appetizer respectively. 

The only knocks on Scotti's are the parking lot and being cash only. The parking lot is tight and can be difficult to navigate but I usually park across the street or near the bank and walk over with no problem. So just park at the bank after hitting the ATM and you have no worries!

What else is there to say? The food is consistently awesome, the prices are fair, and the owner, Scott, and his staff run this place like a well oiled machine. Just make sure you bring cash and a healthy appetite and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Outside of not taking credit cards, this is an OK local Italian place. Stuffed peppers were just ok and bruschetta was a bit more like tomatoes on lightly toasted bread.  The ambiance is quite nice."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. Prices are a little high but not outrageous. Portions aren't all that large but aren't extremely small or anything either. Just don't expect the greatest-tasting food or portions to make up for it if you are just hungry. 

Management: 

How about some lettuce with the salads, please?
Better care with the meatballs too."}
{"text":"Best bread anywhere. Homemade. Best calzone. Large is $8.95. Excellant pasta. Includes salad $9-10. Small neighborhood place. Extremely reasonable prices in food and booze. Most call drinks $4. Been going here for years and always excellant. Nice patio. Cash only. Closes 9:30pm."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch today(Saturday) for a pizza with the grandson. We arrive slightly before they opened at 4:00 and we were warmly welcomed to come in ! Our complimentary warm bread and oil arrived and was delicious. Shortly after our pizza arrived hot and yummy ! We asked if we could have some fresh basil on top and sure enough they had it ! We were given a Sundae for the grandson at the close  of our meal from the owner that surprised and delighted ! We will definitely make this part of our weekend more often. Thank you to our server and the owner Scott !!"}
{"text":"Was seated on the patio. Place was half full. Waited 20 minutes and not one server stopped by our table to even take our drink order or ask if anyone had even helped us yet. Walked out after waiting 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Went for lunch....... AMAZING!!! Warm bread with dipping oil! YUM. Veal parmesan was awesome...."}
{"text":"Great whole in the wall place.

I don't live in the area, but I will go out of my way to eat at Scotti's again and again."}
{"text":"I first went to this place about 10 years ago, and it has been my favorite Italian place to eat at since.  Not only is the food absolutely delicious, it is fairly priced for the amount of food you get. 

When you first get there, you get bread and an oil/vinegar mix.  It is amazing.  It is hard not to fill up on it!

I have gotten numerous dishes here, but my favorites are the veal parmesan or angel hair pasta in basil pesto sauce with mushrooms.  But I have had other dishes that were fantastic as well.  This is a great date night place, or just a place to go with family or friends.

The servers are super nice, and it's a casual place, so no need to dress up!"}
{"text":"First time visitor ... leaving a concert at Euclid Beach Park and opened up Yelp to find a place to eat and Scotti's had stellar reviews. I was not disappointed. The Veal Parmesan with rigatoni pasta & basil sauce was delicious."}
{"text":"A solid Italian dining experience...

THE UP-SIDE:
Pretty damn decent Italian food.  The atmosphere inside is average, but the outside back patio is quiet, private, and really quite nice.  The staff is always, always friendly.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
This isn't \"upscale\" dining.

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Go here to eat good Italian food while you sit on the back patio."}
{"text":"Walk into Scotti's and you're looking at some of the top calzone and pizza in one of the most friendly, pleasant settings in Northeast Ohio. From eggplant parmigiana to chicken marsala, a caprese salad or pesto gnocchi, you won't go wrong with anything on this menu. (Seriously: close your eyes and make a pick. You won't be disappointed!)

Scotti himself makes you feel like a welcomed member of the family, and the food could have been prepared by someone's Italian grandma (if she were a gourmet, that is). 

I read in another review that the \"downside\" to Scotti's is that it's not \"upscale,\" but I guess I'm over the fluff dining scene. I want all the quality food -- nix the price-tag excess (pricey light fixtures, snooty people)! -- in a clean, relaxing environment. A place like Scotti's enables me to really enjoy my food AND my company without having to worry about an uppity scene. It's still neat and classy with my food-enjoying experience at its core."}
{"text":"We have been eating at Scotti's since it opened! The food is consistently awesome, the staff is great, and the owner takes the time to walk around and see how his guests are doing! If I could give this establishment 10 out of five, I would do so! 
Monday is half-price pizza night! Still love  Scotti's!"}
{"text":"A really great place to enjoy solid Italian cooking. Parking in the lot can be difficult if it's very busy. The veal dishes were really top notch and the draft selection features some local breweries such as Great Lakes and Portside, but they also have Newcastle English ale on tap."}
{"text":"Scotty's is our favorite restaurant. We've been going there since it opened however many years ago. They never fail to provide good friendly, efficient service and really delicious food. They have a patio out back for the good weather and a clean well run dining room. You can see the kitchen and even better smell all the wonderful smells. Worth the drive from wherever you live. Well lit safe parking and easy access from anywhere. A hidden gem on 185th st."}
{"text":"Calzones = Amazinggg!!! That's the only thing we have ordered.  We want to try more. Also they only accept cash."}
{"text":"I've probably been here a dozen times in the past few years, and I've never left disappointed.

The food is fantastic, especially over lunchtime. They always start you off with bread and dipping oil. The thing I love about their dipping oil is the pink peppercorns they serve it with.  I recommend any calzone.  If you are not like me and have the discipline to stop eating, a large calzone could feed you twice. Another tasty option is their portabella mushroom salad that comes with their delicious house dressing, a creamy vinagrette. 

The price is reasonable for what you get. The service is okay... The atmosphere is nice, but nothing special (unless it's a nice summer day and you can sit on their patio). But it's the food that keeps me coming back.

One drawback - the oven that cooks the pizzas and calzones is near the dining area. This means your clothes end up smelling like the tasty goodness they serve up.  This may be just me, but I like to eat my food, not wear it."}
{"text":"The food is great, the back patio is lovely. A quiet oasis in the city. A classic in the neighborhood with old-world charm, authentic recipes, good beers, and warm folk.  As we rediscover the classic values and bring them into the present, thisbis a wonderful place to kick back, relax, relate, and reconnect."}
{"text":"Really great Italian food.  Everything I've had there is great.  Cold Peroni on draft makes it even better.

Only complaint is that their bread is loaded with fennel seed, and I'm merely \"meh\" about that.  My wife isn't a big fan of it, but she really loves warm bread, so it's always disappointing to her that she can't enjoy the bread.  If you like fennel seed, the bread's amazing.  Warm and soft and delicious.

The lasagna is to die for.  Service is always very good or great."}
{"text":"I'm slightly biased on this review because I know the owner & he is truly a great guy.  If you're looking for a quaint little place to eat some good Italian food - this is the spot.  The pizza is good, the beer is cold (& cheap) & the service is top of the line.   Also, if you're into disc-golf, be sure to mention this to Scotty as the leagues are played at Sims park up the street & everyone eats at Scotty's afterwards."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine here for lunch or dinner. The calzones are a work of art. Never skimpy on the filling. Excellent prices. Nice wine list, attentive service. Enjoy this local landmark. Remember that it is cash only."}
{"text":"This is more of a check-in. Ordered several pizzas for a group to carry out. Busy location with a small parking lot and tough street parking. Seems to be well staffed and popular. Pizza was great and the dining area made me wish to return. Looks popular with the locals, which is always a good sign. May have been here before and forgot about it, but do give yourself time to park."}
{"text":"Got to dine today at one of my favorite Italian eateries tonight.  Everything on the menu is good, but my favorite is still their pesto pasta."}
{"text":"Great patio great food great service
Had the zucchini fries,coconut shrimp, scallop fettuccine and the Sunday dinner 
All was great ....we will return"}
{"text":"This place has a long history.  The service is good and food is good.  Just wish there was a better option for parking.  The neighborhood is not very safe."}
{"text":"I love the place especially in the summer when he has the back Terrace all decked out in flowers. Make sure to try the tapenade sandwich!   Always has fresh-baked foccaccia bread with delicious olive oil and vinegar :-)"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. Iv been there twice now. Chicken marsala the first time chicken parmigiana the next and wow soooooo good!! Someone I was with got there pizza they said was awesome. The bread and oil they serve before the meal is soooo good. It's hard not to fill up on that. You get a house salad with meals also which was great! Try the patio if it's nice!"}
{"text":"Solid, neighborhood (cash only) Italian fare. 

I used to live in Euclid and used to frequent Scotti's and I'm happy to report that it's still a nice little Italian restaurant featuring pizzas, pastas, calzones, and very traditional Italian fare. They provide fresh baked focaccia bread with every meal and I think I could eat my weight in it. 

I was able to veganize a side salad and a calzone. They took off the cheese for me without a fuss and I built myself a pretty tasty calzone. I washed it all down with a glass of local white wine and left a happy camper.

Definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a good Italian meal. And for the love of God, please pick a restaurant like this over the Olive Garden. Your tummy will thank you for it. I promise."}
{"text":"Best Pizza around in Northeast Ohio.  Quality ingredients, great staff and a variety of classic Italian dishes.  I lived in a lot of places around the country and it is hard to find the quality of pizza in the Cleveland area and Scotti's is on the the top of that list.  I have tried almost every item there and I never had a bad choice."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat that was dog friendly. I think they may have changed their \"Pooch on the Patio\" policy, but they welcomed us right away. Friendly server, great neighborhood atmosphere. Among 4 people, we got 2 calzones (the small is a good meal if you've ordered an app or salad), a sub, and some cheese stuffed thing my wife got. Excellent house salad that is not your typical handful of iceberg. House balsamic was a little spicy, and more of a creamy dressing than I like, but it was good. I would return in  a second, and try anything on the menu. Maybe a different dressing, though. Be aware of the cash only sign on the door (also, restrooms are for patrons only)."}
{"text":"Food is great and at a fair price. Cash only. 

Great pesto cream. Excellent dinner salad. Been coming here for years."}
{"text":"This place is one of Cleveland's best kept secrets!  I love their calzones and salads.  The dressings are homemade and they serve this killer homemade fiocca bread ( to die for).  Drinks are cheap. $4.50 for an Absolute mixed.  Nice menu and reasonably priced.   Everybody is always pleasant---Love Ya Scotti\"s!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a halfway point between downtown and Mayfield Hts., and here it is! Just in time to take advantage of the beautiful outside patio, filled with pots of flowers and a nice, casual ambiance.

This place is great for a casual meal. All the prices are reasonable, and you can choose between pizza, calzones, and plenty of Italian dinner options. I'm a calzone fan, so I had to try the one with mozzarella, basil, tomatoes, and prosciutto. I'm not sure how I feel about the prosciutto in a calzone, but other than that, it was delicious! Very bread-y and melt-in-your-mouth good. I also had a side of the cavatelli pasta, which was alright, but I'm not a huge fan of the sauce. It's pretty average, and not as sweet as I like. Nothing wrong with it though!

Everyone seemed satisfied with their food, and the service was really good. They even brought us some OFF when the bugs started biting. Check it out, and definitely get here before summer ends!"}
{"text":"There are A LOT of Italian restaurants in Cleveland. Little Italy is chock full of excellent restaurants (I'm a fan of Anthony's and Mia Bella myself), but those are more upscale. If you are looking for a solid yet delicious Italian meal, Scotti's is one of the best. I have tried nearly everything on the menu, and it is all wonderful. Best of all, the prices (for food of this quality) are exceedingly reasonable.

Three things of note:

1) They do not take credit cards, so stop at a bank machine (or raid your mattress) before you go.

2) Parking, when it's busy, is a challenge. There is a post office across the street with parking spaces which is available, and it's a hell of a lot easier to park there than at the restaurant.

3) If the weather is decent, go sit on the patio. Not only is it a gorgeous space, you will have absolutely no idea you're in the middle of a busy industrial city or a neighborhood. I can't rate the patio highly enough."}
{"text":"Best Calzone in Cleveland! 
Classic italian-american at reasonable prices.
I regularly eat in and take out, mostly the pizzas and calzones.  Pasta dinners and apps are pretty dang good, and they have a nice dinner salad.

Cash only, but there is a Key Bank and Huntington about a block away."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Scotti's for over a year, mostly take out at lunch time as I work nearby.   Always, fresh, always delicious with consistent excellent service.   Fantastic bread, prices are reasonable with really great food.   The staff are welcoming and warm each time I enter the restaurant.    Now I want Scotti's for lunch today."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I visited this restaurant 3 years ago for the first time & the food was great! Years later, I return and a the same results. The calzone that I ordered was simply amazing, not mention the complimentary appetizer of bread and dipping oil. The service is also great, whenever I needed something I never had to ask because she was all over it. The environment is quiet, pleasant, and clean. If you're ever in the area stop by and check it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Found this wonderful, small place while living on the east side for a couple years. Now that I am back on the west side, I still drive out there every couple of months because the food is excellent! The service is a little iffy at times.

I never had a bad meal here. From the homemade dipping bread, starter salad, pizza, pasta and seafood dishes, everything is amazing. The food always tastes so fresh and the atmosphere is laid back, but warm. 

Eating inside the restaurant can leave you smelling like the place, which normally I would hate. However, there are always fresh bouquets of Peruvian lilies on every table and usually a bigger bouquet at the hostess stand by the front door. The patio is a great place to dine in the summer. There is a high fence all around, lights and plenty of flowers and greenery. It feels like you aren't really in Cleveland.

Love, love, love Scottis!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for quick Italian In the neighborhood and this place had great write ups. Be forewarned before you proceed... Cash only

Love a place with an adjacent Parking lot but surprised the inside held maybe 7 booths, 4 tables and bar seating. Cheap drafts $2.75 for bud light. 

It was a New Year's Eve night so choice of restaurants were limited. Had the mom and pop atmosphere with friendly servers to boot.lots of take out orders going on at the same time which may explain why service was a little slow.

Started off with fresh focaccia bread with a an olive oil/balsamic dip which they already have made for you. Bread was warm and soft almost like muffin density and was the best focaccia I've ever had.

Main entree was chicken Parmesan dinner for $12.75 comes with side salad and bread. The salad had true green leafs ( not cheap iceberg) walnuts,black olives, tomatoes and cucumber. House dressing was a balsamic vinegrette quite tasty. For the chicken Parmesan came with one piece of chicken which had a nice crispy crust and tender white meat just the way I like it. The sauce was a little sweet for my liking but nice and thick to complement each bite

Not sure this place lives up to the star rating which led me here. But prices are decent"}
