Makes you NOT want to return and kinda turns you off"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Montreal.  The service is great and the food is excellent.  We came for a greasy spoon breakfast and it delivered.  The creton and the beans are the stars of the breakfast plate, I love that their beans are not swimming in sugar.  We had a nice friendly chat with our server, I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This was my first meal in Montreal after a 10 hour red eye plane ride. You'd think everything would taste so good being all wanderlust and all. I was told this is the place to go for traditional québécois fair. I got excited going in and being transported to a vintage looking diner with the long counter and few tabletops. Loved that!

And then... The tourtière which is kind of like an american pot pie without the creamy sauce was just bland and boring. Meatballs and gravy lacked any spunk I was hoping for. There were boiled something vegetable looking - All flavors lost. Shepard's pie? I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper and the bffs just couldn't revive the dish. The only saving grace was the baked beans which helped give all of the above a lil umph. 

The place definitely has potential because I've tried all of these again from frozen food and markets at $3.99 per pie that was better."}
{"text":"Beans beans good for your heart the more you eat . we all know how the song goes. And this little institution in the heart of Montreal sure reminds us why the baked bean is so amazingly good. The joint has been around since the 1930s and still gets rave reviews and a steady crowd lining up for traditional Quebec nosh. The articles and photos on the wall are testament to its popularity, and the beans are pretty dam tasty. If you are not a beanie, meat pie, meatball and pig's feet fagout, shepperds pie and pea soup all compete for second - (they will put hairs on your chest). And for the real lumberjacks, follow up with quebec sugar pie, 'pouding chômeur or blanc mange. Yeah!"}
{"text":"I got the Traditional Quebec Plate to get a sampler of different foods from the area and it was a nice sampling. Enjoyed the meat pie slice; it's crust was nice and flaky which I love. The gravy from the meatballs went well with the slice of toast and also complemented the mashed potatoes it came with. I got tea and the poor man's pudding for dessert. I drink my tea black, and found the bitterness from the tea complemented the really sweet poor man's pudding. I added the cream to my poor man's pudding as a nice touch. I also got a slice of sugar pie because why not when in Canada :)

The owner was super friendly and he taught me a bit about Quebec history and the area while I ate which was nice. He also recommended some stuff to do and see since it came up I was just visiting for a few days. Good guy! If you don't want to deal with crowds, because based on what he said it's pretty busy during the day, go for dinner! It's a short walk from Mont-Royal metro station and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"HMMMM I would give this 3.5

PROs

-Authentic Quebec cool old.
- Good menu, good prices
-Nice staff

Food

- The toast was extremely greasy and burnt-ish, not in a great way.
-potatoes were good.
-Good bacon/sausage/egg
-the beans were uber fatty and needed syrup

I would go back but I wish this was that little bit better."}
{"text":"One fine day we were walking on Mont-Royal and noticed this diner. Being breakfast people, we walked in to check out the place where the owner told us to come in for the best breakfast in town.

Turns out said owner had a lot of nerve calling this food; it looks like something that needs to be chucked. Smells like yesterday's garbage. Service, on top of bad food, was horrible and non-existent. I would have given it to a homeless person, but why hurt a homeless person.

In closing, if you are looking for a strong case of indigestion, bad atmosphere and just bad food, then go visit them ... Dog food probably tastes better!"}
{"text":"I agree wholeheartedly with David M.'s review: when it comes down to it, the reason to come here is for the beans, which are unparalleled.  Lose sight of the beans, yeah, it can be mediocre; focus on the beans and it approaches 5*****! 

You will see other customers pouring maple syrup onto their beans.  I don't think they need that, but if you wanna try it, go crazy!

I would only come here for breakfast, which is absolutely fine and comes with a side of beans.  I always get some extra to go.  The owner who is usually behind the counter is very friendly and accommodating.

I NEVER miss this place when I got to Montreal (except once, when I couldn't find it: I'm not sure why, it's very close to the Mount Royal subway stop.)"}
{"text":"Yoann B. a demandé à nos hôtes un brunch typiquement montréalais pour le dimanche matin lors de notre séjour sur Montréal. C'est sans trop réfléchir qu'ils nous ont emmené à la binerie !

L'établissement n'est pas très grand, nous sommes quatre et nous nous installons au comptoir. A peine installé on nous propose café ou thé qui nous serons servis à volonté.

Quelle bonne surprise ce fut, leur spécialité les fèves au lard furent une tuerie sans nom. Les ufs sont cuisinés comme vous le souhaitez, ici c'est vous le roi.
Ce fut avec une grande peine que j'ai fini mon assiette mais ce fut bien bon. 
Un peu gras pour mon estomac malade moins de 48h après mais rien de très dérangeant. 


Nous nous en sommes sortis avec une addition plus que raisonnable pour ce que nous avons manger ! 
Une adresse que je vous recommande vivement si vous passez dans le coin. Et pourquoi pas enchainé sur la visite du Mont royal comme nous (j'avoue que la j'ai un peu souffert par contre)  !"}
{"text":"This is another Montréal institution, renowned for its \"fèves aux lard\" or baked beans for non francophones, located in the heart of the plateau. After living nearby for so many years, my husband and I finally decided to stop in for lunch & brunch (we couldn't decide what we were in the mood for, so we had both!). Given its history in the area, I had high expectations, which unfortunately weren't fully met. 

For starters, the place definitely does have all the charm of an old-school Quebec breakfast diner. It was nice to sit at the counter and soak in the scenery. We ordered a breakfast (two eggs and a crepe) as well the Quebec full plate (with pea soup, tourtiere and dessert). I significantly preferred the breakfast over the plate. However, when I asked for syrup, I was a little shocked to hear it did not come with real maple syrup, and I had to pay an extra $1.75 for the real stuff. Not sure how you can build your business around being a legit Quebec diner, and yet offer table syrup - big disappointment. 

The staff was efficient and well within the realm of what you'd expect - slightly too nosy for my taste, but it's a local diner so to be expected. 

I honestly don't think I need to come back here, unless I'm really in the mood for a diner style breakfast with over priced syrup. 

It's also worth noting that they have strange hours on wkds, where they close between 3pm and 5pm."}
{"text":"So much goodness in this tiny hole in the wall. What's not to love from the traditional Quebec breakfast. If you like cretons, meat pie, crispy bacon, baked beans and friendly service, this place is for you! 

Before you go, you should know there's a big bar seating area and a few 2-ppl tables, so I would think twice before heading there with a group."}
{"text":"This one i have to give props to my Rough Guides Montreal.  Just four tables and a long counter in this hole in the wall diner, which prides itself on on traditional Quebecois cuisine served here since 1938.  The feves au lard is the house specialty which is a simple yet rich baked beans dish.  I had the pleasure of talking with the owner Phil who was a wealth of knowledge as to where i should eat next.  To finish off my trip to La Benerie, i had pouding au chomeur, which translates to unemployed bread pudding.  Yummy.  I would say a must stop if you really want the full Montreal experience."}
{"text":"This place exists since 1938, and in spite of being born here, I had never eaten there! I knew it existed, and recommended it to a European tourist looking for \"traditional Québécois cuisine\" (she thought we only had poutine and pouding chômeur). And then, I thought, why not go together? It was a very fun experience. But first, you have to know that the English equivalent for \"binerie\" is \"greasy spoon\". Since it's the name of restaurant, it's really in that mindset that you need to enter the place, if you want to appreciate it for what it is!
Looking at the menu, it was pretty much what I would have at my grandmother's place. Good old, hearty comfort food. It's probably better in the winter time, but as long as it's not a super hot summer day, then why not? I had the \"assiette québécoise\" - kind of a sampler plate. I would recommend it to those who go for the first or only time. But you might miss out on other things -- like the most Québécois plate (in my opinion), the pâté chinois. The food is good, honest, and super filling. I wish I could try their pouding chômeur, but they were out!
I really liked the ambiance, but you need to know what to expect. It is a bit cramped and Everybody sits side by side at the bar (although we got the three spots by the front window; it was nice). This means it is not a good place for group. The service is super friendly, and they were patient even if we had a  hard time making up our mind before ordering. It seems really popular, with the place being still full at 12:45pm for lunch, and many people just drop in for take-out food. The music is also a good sampling of Québec culture (Beau Dommage, Félix Leclerc, etc.). I really want to go back sometime to try other plates.
Now, I can confidently recommend this place to tourists who want a taste of Québec, and having tried it myself, I know it is not a tourist trap; that's how it tastes at home!"}
{"text":"My doctor told me a few years ago that I needed to watch my blood pressure. It was a wake up call, and since then I've had to change my diet significantly: less processed foods, less sugar, more fruits and veggies, exercising more, etc. So instead of treating myself EVERY meal, I spread the indulgence out accordingly. Today was one of those days to indulge, and thanks to Yelp we discovered this place and we are glad we did!

La Binerie, I would imagine, is a trip back in time, on the Quebecois time machine. Comfort food that families ate to build up for the harsh winters; food that bearded lumberjacks ate to fuel up for long physical work days. The place itself is a small countertop dinerette, where the lovely staff welcome you in from the cold. The pictures and decorations that adorn the faded walls look like they've been there for longer than I've been alive, and along with the French music and smell of beans and pork traveling from the kitchen, it oozes of old world charm. 

It was on the earlier side of a Sunday afternoon, so we went with the breakfast options. I had the two-eggs breakfast which included sausage, bacon, ham, toast, potatoes, and feves au lard (beans with lard--their specialty). Everything was amazing: full of flavor, cooked just right, buttery porky fat goodness. In other words, indulgence. 

On top of that, the price was just right, roughly around $12 with coffee, tax, and tip. I definitely plan on making this a monthly thing, especially with this winter season coming up. Need to build some insulation in my body!!!!"}
{"text":"De passage à Montreal, il fallait faire un stop par la binerie pour un petit dejeuner. Le plateau oeufs-bacon-saucisse-pommes rissolée est plutôt banal mais les fèves au lard sont tout bonnement magique. On y retournera pour tester les autres spécialités telles que la tourte. A ne pas rater!
Tes bon service aussi. Un endroit très accueillant et chaleureux."}
{"text":"La Binerie is another institution in the Plateau-Mont-Royal area. Specializing in baked beans and bean soup, La Binerie is a popular and old-school diner offering hearty fare, generous portions, and classic Quebec comfort food. 

The decor is diner-style with seating mainly for one or two people and diner style seating with a view of the baked bean station and menu.  

Most diner order baked beans and breakfast fare like pancakes and eggs, but La Binerie also serves meat loaf, meat pies, sandwiches and more.  Order as a combination and you'll receive complimentary bean (pea) soup, mashed potatoes, and dessert.  Our order:

Traditional Poutine - $10.95.  Classic style. Nicely fried fries.  Squeaky cheese curds.  Could use more gravy. 

Meat Pie Meal - $14.95.  The bean soup is brown (don't think it's pea soup) and fairly standard fare. The meat pie and mashed potatoes are very filling but otherwise unmemorable. 

Overall, La Binerie was nice to stop by for the history and the Poutine but it isn't quite the flavor spot of other Plateau-Mont-Royal institutions like Schwartz's.  

La Binerie accepts credit cards and is very friendly."}

{"text":"Good breakfast - I should come back for a lunch/dinner as well! 
I've been meaning to come here for quite some time, but they were closed on Mondays, etc...  But today I made it! I had quite a build up of expectations - word to the wise - always minimize your expectations, this type of place is usually over-hyped. Yet, I had a good meal - and the menu is classic Quebecois, so it's truely a nice experience. Unlike what a few reviews claim - the owner / staff were really nice even though my French is so so. When I asked (in French) what was the 'boudin noir' the guy answered 'blood sausage' and kindly offered me an English menu. I declined politely - because I knew that I wanted that! It came with eggs (I asked for scrambled), potatoes fried with onion (good), two pieces of toast (not burned as some reviews here claim), and their famous beans in lard (OK). The blood sausage was great. The coffee - meh. This was one heavy breakfast! I had it at 10 o'clock and basically skipped lunch (well I had a smoothie in the late afternoon, but that kept me going all day!). It's not a good place for groups of more than three because of the seating arrangements, but the place does have lots of character! I liked the food and the atmosphere a lot.  I can't wait to try some more!"}
{"text":"a few things, to set this review page back on the right course.

there's a reason this place is so famous.  the beans are without question the best quebec-style baked beans available in a restaurant.  the specials are very special (the chicken pie is excellent and thursdays for the rôti de porc were, at a certain stage in my life, glorious).  the english breakfasts, though no longer cheap like in the old days, will set you right after a night of reveling.  people complain about the toasts and the tourtière and that: they're fools who ought to eat elsewhere.  sure, the bread is grilled and dressed with lard; sure, everything on the menu contains pig in some way; sure, you have to order a special to get a vegetable onto the plate.  it is what it is, like a joint in southie or queens.

so, to close by way of a summary and to outline a few pointers for folks who're visiting for the first time:

- always check the specials, all specials include soup and dessert in the price (in french, it's called a menu or a forfait: the  more  you  know), the pouding chômeur is a syropy cake, best is the blanc mange 
- never order the tourtière, unless there's a special of tourtière lac saint jean, which is made with game meat, usually deer
- if ordering the english breakfast and you don't want the lard toasts, i.e. if you're crazy, say 'les toasts avec du beurre, s'il vous plait' (lay toasts ah-vec burr, seal voo play).
- it's one of the only restos in montreal also serving dark maple syrop (in quebec, there's a grading system, and this would be 'foncé' or grade D), it's a really old school flavor, much like molasses, the oldsters love it and it's a shame that it's dying out, give it a shot
- critically, no matter what you order, always, always, order the beans.  i generally do not love this comestible, but this place does something so special with them that it's very difficult not to fall under their spell.  every other diner of this genre has closed, this one persists on the strength of the beans.  if you eat on a weekday morning, you'll see old time québécois men just eating beans and toast, with tea or maybe coffee.
- you'll notice that many a patron saturates her or his beans with maple syrop, this is something that people do, and if there's an afterlife, they will be called to account for it, no question.  needless to say, it's an utterly appalling habit calling to mind the worst excesses of the french revolution, these beans deserve a more noble end, a fork and mouth, that is all."}
{"text":"Not open when advertised. Online and door signs stated open until 9pm and we arrived at 7pm.  No signs on the door to explain why. Made a special trip just to go there based on recommendations and had to find somewhere else to eat. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"La Binerie actually refers to the Musical Fruit in French.
The Beanery's namesake speciality is Baked Beans. 2.5'd
However we're here for other Quebecois Traditional Fare.

Tourtière        Pouding Noir         Soupe aux Pois
(Meat Pie)     (Black Pudding)     (Pea Soup)

First off, I simply loved the PEA SOUP. It's perfect on a chilly day.
As much as I wanted to like traditional Grandmother-style dishes...
The Tourtière's dry crumbling grey ground meat was not doing it.

Pouding Noir was Fried Black Pudding, no more no less.
Same can be said for the Homestyle side Veg/Potato Mash.
It's as old-school age-old homestyle food as you can get.
It came with Apple Pie Filling. A good way to end the Meal."}
{"text":"THERE IS NOTHING BETTER THAN LA BINERIE! I still dream about the breakfast I had here. Every item on the menu is the best version of that bfast item you could ever find anywhere. Maybe the food tasted better because of the unassuming environment, but so what! The old-fashioned diner makes it feel like you've gone back in time, and the owner/chef (a one person operation when I was there!!!) shows an old video of the diner during its first years, with the same chef/owner. Creating this feeling of nostalgia, the food feels even more special now that you know the same chef was making all the same classic dishes for his guests decades ago.

We came for the baked beans - as they are a staple of Montreal - and was so pleased with the ones here. I hadn't had better. The toast was also a stand out, buttered and charred to perfection, I would do anything to replicate it. The bacon was fantastic as was the spinach omelette. We also ordered a slice of shephard's pie because he makes them fresh daily, and that was also great! Could've skipped it considered we'd ordered so much, but happy we didn't."}
{"text":"Si vous voulez goûter à la cuisine traditionnelle québécoise ou tout simplement si vous voulez voir de vos propres yeux la Binerie Mont-Royal qui était au centre du roman Le Matou d'Yves Beauchemin, ce petit restaurant est pour vous. Situé à quelques pas du métro Mont-Royal, ce petit restaurant compte quelques tables, mais les clients mangent principalement au comptoir. Aussi, personne n'ira vous porter votre assiette à votre table. 

Comme plat principal, vous avez le choix entre des fèves au lard, de la soupe aux pois, de pâté chinois, de la tourtière ou du ragoût de pattes. Au dessert, entre le pouding chômeur et la tarte au sucre. J'ai personnellement choisi le pâté chinois, qui mélangé plutôt qu'en étage, correspond bien à la tradition populaire. Aussi, ce restaurant fait le pari de l'authenticité et n'interprète pas, comme d'autres chefs le font très bien à Montréal, le patrimoine culinaire québécois. AUssi, comme cette institution montréalaise a été fondée en 1938, c'est en quelque sorte un musée vivant que cette binerie et personne ne se plaindra qu'il soit traditionnel."}
{"text":"La Binerie Mont Royal is a classic down home Quebec diner. Open since 1938, it gives a very quaint, old fashioned Quebec impression.  On the walls under the title \"Notre passé - Notre histoire\" are snaps of Quebec through the ages.

The house specialty is beans (fèves au lard) that accompany any of the fried breakfast combos. Maple syrup should be applied generously to the beans.

Also worth a mention is the homemade meat pie. \"This goes well with ketchup\" said the patron. 

Good service and accommodating in both French and English."}

{"text":"If you want to try all the speciality of Canada come here since it has them all. They have the Quebec plate which has the meat ball and pie with  the spit pea soup. The smoke ham with beacon I also like. We were there for lunch, but they are also good for breakfast."}
{"text":"The food was disappointing - burnt toast, cold eggs-- the service was subpar, and the server was rude. I asked for milk and she said that the creamer \"milker\" was milk. Yeah, okay. I don't do creamer. I wanted milk and was going to pay for it. Also, she was not happy when I asked her if she spoke English. Her response was \"Well, what choice are you giving me?\"  sourpuss face included. I keep forgetting that in Montreal you don't ask that, you just speak English. My French is mediocre, and when I try to use it, Montrealers always tell me to \"say it in English\", so you just can't win. I don't think I'll speak fluent French overnight, but I also won't stop coming to Montreal because I just love it.  What I can do though, is not give my business to rude people. There are  plenty of gracious Francophones who understand  they live in a cosmopolitan city that attracts people from all over the world --  and are welcoming to those who did not grow up speaking Proust's tongue."}
{"text":"I come to La Binerie....EVERY time I am in Montreal and recommend it to everyone I hear is travelling there. I have had breakfast lunch and dinner there and I love EVERYTHING they serve. For breakfast, if you have never had or even if you have..get the Blood Pudding Sausage with your breakfast. Yeah...I Know, I Know...but trust me...DELICIOUS. If you have never been there for dinner...get the FULL Quebecois Dinner and finish it off with their Pouding Chomeur...It is QUINTESSENTIAL Quebec.......BUT...the STAR of La Binerie are the BAKED BEANS of course! These aren't B&M or Bush's. These beans are a dish called Feves au Lard and these are meatier, crisper and more savoury so that you can sink your teeth into them. My twenty-something daughter was with me one night and was never turned on by the typical, sugary baked beans but these beans made her see how baked beans were served to our forefathers for generations all over Quebec and New England and she ate ALL of them and commented on them for the rest of our trip to Canada.

La Binerie has every great greasy spoon and diner that you've ever been in condensed down into one long, narrow storefront on Avenue Mont-Royal in my favorite neighborhood, Le Plateau and 1 1/2 blocks from the Mont Royal Metro Station.

The People? The Service?....SUPERB! The owner Philippe can be your Dutch Uncle or in his case \"Mon Oncle\" while you are in Montreal. He is a fountain of local knowledge and recommendations and his wife Jocelyne is a delight and can cook EVERYTHING that your Memere used to make to all you Franco-Americans from New England Mill Towns.

For ME....La Binerie is the BEATING HEART of Le Plateau."}
{"text":"This place is not just an incredible eatery, but also holds a spot in Québécois pop culture history as the setting of Yves Beauchemin's novel Le Matou. 

This charming joint has been around for over 30 years, making a name for itself (just as the name suggests) with Montreal's finest baked beans. Now, if you've ever been to a cabane á sucre, you'll know that traditional bine are cooked for hours in a deep casserole, using some kind of magical grease. Not sure what wizardry this place used to perfect their art, but they definitely tick off both of the previously discussed requirements. 

As for the rest of the food, you pretty much can't go wrong. Traditional Québecois, stick to your ribs fare that always leaves you satisfied. From early breakfast to late lunch, you're pretty much guaranteed to leave with a smile. 

People go on about Montreal smoked meat and bagels, but you haven't truly indulged in the city until you grab une bonne bine."}

Sinon, qu'est-ce qu'on y mange ? Des \"bines\" et non pas des haricots ou des flageolets.
Ici, la spécialité est donc une préparation de fèves au lard. C'est excellent, on en redemanderait. C'est sans compter sur les énormes assiettes servies.
La mienne était composée de boudin noir, d'oeuf (préparé de la façon qui nous plait), de pommes de terre rôties et de pain grillé.

La Binerie does worth a visit... not for the food but for it's history as it was opened at 1938 almost 75 years ago .... and the set up and the menu still remain the same.

Tourtiere ($8.95) is definitely not my kind of comfort food as I found it a little dry, really dry.... 

Boudin Noir with Pea Soup ($10.95) Pea soup though is really comforting.. The black pudding has this gluey texture but I love the apple sauce that comes with it... 

Great place for breakfast/bunch as they serves all day breakfast at a reasonable price..."}
{"text":"La Binerie is a local treasure which should have hundreds of reviews like Schwartz' or La Banquise, not a handful. This is a sparsely furnished lunch counter, but warm and welcoming. Come for breakfast ($1.50 surcharge after 11 am, because why?) or for lunch (before they close at 2 pm) and enjoy bountiful traditional food.

The pea soup is one of the best renditions I've ever had. The pudding chomeur (on the full menus, or ala carte) was sweet and comforting as a warm spoonful of maple syrup. Meat pie and the blood sausage on my breakfast plate were excellent. I wasn't particularly excited about the signature beans with lard, which tasted like canned baked beans with added fat to me, sorry.

While you're here, be sure to peruse the clippings on the wall as well as the poster for Le Matou, a prize-winning 1984 film featuring this establishment (according to the blurb in the menu, it's a fictional tale of a boy who wants to own a restaurant which looks like this one(."}
