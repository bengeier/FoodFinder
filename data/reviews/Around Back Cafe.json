{"text":"Ate there this evening for the first time.  I have to give it a very mixed review.

Server was great but stretched between patio and dining room so she only stopped back at our table once.  The hostess almost catatonic and disappeared for what seemed like a long time leaving us wait on the patio. Draft beer was flat with no head at all. 

Food--menu looked good and sandwiches seemed tasty.  French fries were cold and greasy.  It seemed like they were cooked in advance they tried to warm them up.  

I'll try it again and hope that today was a fluke. I really want to root for local restaurants but my first visit gave me less hope that this will ever prove to be a viable local alternative."}
{"text":"As much as I like the shrimp here, the service is horrible. Called in a pick up order. Jaime couldn't understand a no cheese due to food allergy. Then our shrimp dinner came without cocktail sauce."}
{"text":"Been there about 40 times now! Gets better every time. Try the coconut chicken salad - awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad writing this as this was one of my favorite places to eat for years!!! Unfortunately we have been back here twice over the last year and each time our meals were pitiful compared to what it used to be and way overpriced for what we received. Not to mention they charge the same price for a kids drink as an adults drink and when questioned about it since my child didn't even get a refill we were told \"yeah that's just what they charge\" So disheartened by this whole turn of events and quality and level of service provided here. Our waitress had the worst attitude. I got a fried breaded fish sandwich which had more water run out of it then was running down the Allegheny River which was just disgusting. My fries were not thoroughly cooked and while ordered a large order of sloppy fries and they were tiny compared to before and the cheese wasn't melted because the fries weren't hot neither was the gravy. Everyone else in our party of 7 had issues with some part of the meal/service and had to ask for things to be fixed. I could go on but what's the point. Doing my best to leave positive reviews where they are owed and shy away from the negative but this just sucked..."}
{"text":"Well as usual spent time figured out what we wanted just to be told oh we're out of that yet again. And of course told hostess should of td you sorry.. Well if hostess were not on phones congregating.. Wait! Maybe if they put a note in their phone they would remember. So decided on breadsticks that said nacho cheese and honey mustard dip. They came and not only still cold in middle but hair through one. AND just cheese. So before realizing temp and hair we said where is honey mustard? That is OR we are told.. Our response did we black out when you asked us which one we would like and when will you be changing and to or? At least that got charge for honey mustard taken off... Shame really because when this place opened it was SPECTACULAR. Now hit or miss and seems most food froZen and reheated."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday morning with my Mom and sister.  It wasn't particularly crowded when we arrived, although within about half an hour, the place was full.  I guess the many nearby churches were letting out by then.

I ordered the Hawaiian chicken wrap and was impressed by its flavor and value.  For less than $7, I got a wrap that was so large, it served as 2 meals.  I suppose it didn't hurt that my Mom ordered an appetizer tray that was also huge and I ate off of that before my wrap finally arrived.  I'm not sure what the delay was, but it was loooong!  Several parties that arrived after us were served  before we were, and none of us ordered anything that seems as if it should have taken that long to prepare.  Besides the aforementioned appetizer tray and wrap, my sister ordered the Italian hoagie.  We proceeded to wait at least 45 minutes for our food- possibly as long as an hour.  Although the service was friendly and drinks were refilled as we waited (and waited) for our orders, I just can't justify a rating higher than 3 stars for this experience.  If we had been offered an explanation, maybe I would have given Around Back 4 stars.  On that day, had the wait been reasonable, I would have given it 5 stars.  I imagine most people who visit don't have to wait as long as we did, so it seems like it would be a safe bet for a tasty meal at a good price!"}
{"text":"It is a couple years past my former review (see below) and my son wanted to try this place again (sigh). We were going to have 7 in our party so I called right after they opened for the day and requested a table for 7 at 6pm. I was informed they don't take reservations and I should have someone here 20 minutes early to sign in. 

I arrived a little before 20 minutes before and was informed it would be a long wait. They put my name on the list and I notice a card on the hostess stand that said 9 @ 6 pm.  I asked and that wasn't me. Evidently \"some\" people can reserve a time. 
At 6pm came in this large group of people that walked right to their table.

This doesn't bode well for the evening.

Alas, we waited an hour and never did get seated. 
This my previous review will stand in perpetuity because I don't think I'm going back.



(2014) review-----------


French onion soup? Don't bother - broth with onions thrown in (not cooked in) and
Pizza cheese on top. Stuffed rigatoni with meat sauce is good and Italian wrap acceptable. I have eaten dinner here twice (both non-memorable) and lunch (today) once. We have friends that love this place. For us - eh .... Would be three stars except for the whack job that called that tasteless bowl soup, and tried to get me to eat it.
Service was ok except that they never did ask me if everything was alright like they did the other tables. Did she already know? from 2014:

{"text":"Anyone that has given this place a positive review is either delusional, hasn't ever been to a decent restaurant, or works here. The service is absolutely horrendous. Servers are inattentive and openly rude. The menu is all cheap fried crap, and anything that's a vegetable comes out looking like they shipped it from mars. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"This place gets four stars because it's one of the best places in the area. However, if this restaurant were located closer to Pittsburgh I would give it a three. 

For New Kensington this place is really good. They have an affordable lunch menu. This is typically where my colleagues and I go for lunch if we want to eat out. They have fast and friendly service which is convenient. 

Their Friday special of a cod sandwich with lobster bisque is really good. I also really enjoy their chicken parm sandwich. Their salads are huge.

To be honest I have never been disappointed here, I'm just not calling up my friends raving about this place."}
{"text":"Went to watch a hockey game nothing great about the place but drinks are cheap enough bartender was fairly attentive and some of the best fried provolone I have had in a long time good local bar but not great for sports.   Small tv no HD"}
{"text":"I went there with my wife and another couple who had good reviews on it. The atmosphere was nice. Some update can probably be done but decorated very nice. We got the cheese sticks which were home made and amazing! Wanted to try everything. I also got their wings. Buffalo Ranch was a nice taste. Wings were very good. Had some left over and still great the next day. Out of all of us we had a fish, burger, wrap and pot roast. All of the portions were great for the price. I had the pot roast and gravy and it was delish. Fries were hot and not that they were under the heat lamp. Wendy our waitress was on the ball and helped us the whole time. Also had fried icecream and cheesecake. Both were very very good. I will look forward to go back for more! This is a place worth going to!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this place on our way back from a long day in the city and I was pleasantly surprised with it.  It really is around back of a small strip mall but it has a little patio area out front and a normal bar/restaurant inside.  We got the fried zucchini, stuffed mushrooms, and loaded potato skins.  I had never  had fried zucchini before and it came out in long spirals, breaded and friend, pretty good.  The stuffed mushrooms were decent, but my favorite was the potato skins.  They actually put broccoli on top which seemed weird to us at first but ended up tasting great.

This is one of your typical hole in the wall, bar food bars, so don't expect anything fancy but you get attentive service and it's one of those places where everyone knows everyone.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Worst gyro ever!  Very little meat and lettuce, no cucumber sauce, next to no tomatoes or onions.  I asked the server if there was a new cook because the gyros used to be MUCH better.  She went back to ask the manager for an answer to my question.  A good manager would come out and speak wih me directly and offer to resolve my complaint somehow.  This manager did not.  The server came back to our table and said, \"He said everythings' s the same.\"  That was it!  I asked if she could discount my dinner and was told \"no.\"  Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, service is always great and reataraunt is always a top choice. Daily lunch specials are totally worth it and prices aren't bad any other one either."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for fish sandwich!  The onion rings are the bomb!!!  Great place for fried, bar food."}
