{"text":"My parents bought me to this place, and it's our new go to dim sum place in Markham and Richmond Hill. The dim sums are very fresh, well made and tasty. They were running a promo and all dim sums were $1.99 flat from Monday to Friday 9 am to 3 pm. The dim sum menu is in both Chinese and English. The staff were quick and friendly. This place is a bit of an unknown, so we never have to wait for a table.  I honestly cannot recommend another restaurant with dim sum of this quality, and cheap as well. Definitely check this place out for your next dim sum outing!"}
{"text":"We come here with the family quite often for dim sum and dinner. The food is really good, and for large parties it's a good value. Almost every dish we have tried has been tasty, even our family who came from HK commented on how good the food was. It's getting busier than in years past, and sometimes there's a bit of a wait. There is some confusion with the name of the restaurant, as there are two restaurants in this plaza with the same name; this one has a blue sign outside. Make sure to try it!"}

Another new Cantonese Chinese Restaurant!

This used to be Best Cook Restaurant, and now Mongkok Chinese Cuisine with new signal, new paint and new carpeting! 

Near empty restaurant, I have to drag my dinner mate's and push him into the restaurant if not I know he is going to pop in Keung's  Restaurant next door. 

The menu here at Mongkok is really simple. Selections of Cantonese dishes, seafood specialities and some Szeuchuan  dishes.

Salty Baked Chicken ($10.99)
- Free ranch chicken resulted in really lean meat.  A healthy choice but is on the dry side 
- chicken was well flavoured 

Mushroom with Vegetables ($8.50)
- Big huge mushrooms!  Huge portions and great value 

Free Chinese soup and dessert to round up our meal! 

Waiter was friendly but still need training. 

BYOB with no corkage fees,  10%off Grand Opening Specials..... I will be back!"}
