{"text":"Quality has gone downhill lately and this winery no longer has a boutique \"feel\".  Not sure what has happened...maybe just the inevitable shakeout of the over-crowded market.  Not going back, sorry!  Sonja Demetrios"}
{"text":"What a nice barn and tasting room.  The Vineyards surround it so you can sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine. We went there specifically for the Dortmunder but they didn't have any. Descent wines, friendly staff, beautiful views."}
{"text":"Windows are filthy. Looks like they haven't been cleaned in years and mop the floor.   Haven't been in a year or so.  Nice that the parking lot has black top.  Riesling was ok."}
{"text":"Very quaint place.  The wines were tasty and the pizza we had was nice.  It is somewhere you can go to relax have a glass of wine and a small bite to eat.  Everyone is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Thanks be to Jehovah!  Delicious, complex, well balanced wine!  

Favorites:
Dornfelder - es ist k√∂stlich!  Translation:  it is delicious!  This German grape is dry but not overly harsh, makes a wine with a gorgeous color and a long, satisfying finish.  

Gewurztraminer - sooooo good!  Amazing golden color and perfect consistency.  I would drink this everyday for the rest of my life if I could.

They also have a delicious Cab, Chardonnay, Cab Franc and Riesling and fruit wines (word of mouth only, fruit wines aren't my thing so I didn't taste any but I smelled them and they smell like heaven).

If you're looking for a winery that seems hell bent on producing quality wines with exceptional flavors, head to Vermilion Valley right away.  They are definitely the BEST winery in all of W. Ohio!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, friendly staff my wife and I had a good time. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great location!  Plenty of outdoor and indoor seating.  The people that work here are amazing and very friendly.  They have a great tasting - 6 tastings for $5.  It was great to try the different types of wines.  They also have some great snacks and appetizers that pair up nicely with the wines."}
{"text":"As newbies to the area, we were looking for a place that we can get to know and enjoy.   We went on a Saturday night when there was a couple performing folk music, which was great.  We enjoyed a bottle of wine outside on the patio while listening to music.   We shared a cheese and meat plate, which was very nice, and also a pizza, which we didn't really like.   Doesn't matter, as there are other food choices.  The atmosphere is great, and we enjoyed the wine."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! My wife and I enjoyed an evening on the patio listening to a folk duet performance. We shared a bottle of dry red and the cheese and meat platter. We loved the whole experience"}
{"text":"This was right on the way from our drive to Cuyahoga National Park, so we decided to stop by. We went when it was still pretty chilly outside, so there wasn't any foliage and the outdoors looked bleak and gray. However, the inside of the building was nice, clean, and quaint.

We tried the flight of 6 for $5 which was such a good deal! Our favorites were the Dornfelder and Traminette. We ended up getting a glass of the Dornfelder for $6 and a meat & cheese platter. The platter was okay. It was just a variety of deli meats, cubed cheese, a few crackers, and olives. It left something to be desired, and I don't think it was worth $8 for the quality of ingredients. However, we ended up loving the Dornfelder so much that we purchased a bottle of it!

The live music and atmosphere was great, especially as it got darker and more people came in. I'd be willing to come here again if I was in the area, perhaps during a warmer season so I could sit outdoors."}
{"text":"Awesome place for Your Wedding and Reception...  Have done a few here, they have an awesome Staff, who go out of their way to make your day Special. Their wines are top notch...."}
