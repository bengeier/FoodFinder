{"text":"Got the wrong order twice, took almost an hour to get it right.  Probably just bad luck"}
{"text":"Had the all American breakfast. It was good. Order came with a free coffee. The gentleman that took my order was very accommodating and took the time to show me where are the coffee items where since it was my first time there. I would return. 
Order was prompt."}
{"text":"Not a fan. Had 2 companies come in complaining to managers about needing to pay their bills while I was their to eat. Was very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Hit and miss...Usually, miss.

My husband and I have eaten here several times and I think today is our last. The food ALWAYS takes forever, and today they served two tables before us when they ordered after! Our paninis were overcooked and the soup was cold. I tried a different sandwich than usual, the Italian, and was disappointed. The sauce didn't really mesh well with the rest of the sandwich and the meat tasted more like hot dog. The Bandito is normally pretty good, when it is on the correct bread...My husband had it today and for some reason, they put it on the ciabatta instead of the focaccia today. Not so good.

Another negative, the tables are always dirty!

There are better places to go for soups, salads and sandwiches."}
{"text":"We came in for a quick lunch on a Thursday. There were a few people but it wasn't very crowded. They had a unique menu of sandwiches, soups, Panini's and salads. I decided to get the combo, with a half-sandwich and salad. I got the gobbler for my half-sandwich which consisted of turkey, sun-dried tomato mayo, feta and artichoke hearts. My salad was the spinach salad which was spinach, apples, feta and walnuts with an apple-cider vinaigrette. They were both very good, they portions were really large and I couldn't finish my meal. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. The only thing I would have done was put less mayo on my sandwich, but it did have really good flavor. The bread tasted fresh and they put a lot of meat and cheese on the sandwich. The dressing was really good and light. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and will definitely be back to try some more of their sandwiches. My meal came out to be around 8 dollars."}
{"text":"I love their combos! The seafood bisque is a must-try and their paninis are always oh-so-good! And we always order extra pickles cause one is never enough. Wayyy better than Panera Bread."}
{"text":"I love the pick-a-dilly yo or whatever its called combo. You get a choice of half a sandwich or panini, salad, or soup. It about $6 or so.

I love the sausalito bandito panini. It has turkey, pepper jack cheese, sundried tomatoes, and roasted red peppers. My fave! I haven't tried any of the others because well, I really like this one. Their sandwiches and subs, don't sound too appetizing to me.

I usually get the twiced baked potato soup, which I find very delish. Its really thick somewhat cheesy. I've been wanting to try the seafood bisque but its always sold out when I go! =(

It comes with a spicy pickle (ha!) which I very much look forward to getting. It has spices on it, I think there are even corriander seeds on it too. It compliments the meal very well.

Service here is usually quick. Staff is friendly. No complaints there. Although Panera Bread has better quality food, I still like Spicy Pickle because their combo is a little more affordable. Whereas Panera Bread, you have to pay additional for the signature sandwiches and salads."}
{"text":"Fresh yummy sandwiches! I stopped by for the first time today on my lunch break and the cashier was really friendly and sweet guy. I got the tuna spinach wrap and it tasted magical! The place is so clean!"}
{"text":"Great lunch, decent prices and an overall fantastic place!  They have great cuts of meat that are full of flavor, great tasting bread and awesome vegetables. What more could you want in a sandwich? The wife and I frequent this place for a late breakfast/early lunch and we could not be more pleased. The \"Wiseguy\" rules, so hard."}
{"text":"Garbage. Wish I could give zero stars, I probably could've made the same sandwich at home for about 50 cents. Trash ingredients, trash portions, and a terrible taste. The only good thing is the Miss Vickies chips. Pssssh garbage; go out of business already so we can get a place where we can get some quality food instead of this overpriced garbage."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  I'm always on the lookout for a great sandwich and Spicy Pickle failed miserably.

Dismal food quality and quantity.  Incredibly overpriced!  Nearly $13 for a sandwich and a bowl of soup.  No drinks or chips in that price.

It's a fairly new place near my office and I decided to check it out.  I got a pannini sandwich that had almost no meat on it at all..  It came with a side of orange slices that appeared on the verge of rotting.  I also ordered a large bowl of chicken noodle soup.  It should just be called noodle soup.  There was less than one tablespoon of chicken, a few small bits of carrot and just a bunch or waaaay over cooked noodles.  So over cooked that you cannot tell they are noodles when you eat them,.  Just pure mush.

I'll never go back.  Silly me!  It's my fault.  This is what happens when I decided not to go to Capriotti's.  I'll even take Subway over this over-priced rip off."}
{"text":"Well... I kinda feel bad about giving it 3 stars since I got a groupon deal anyway but anyways...
Ordered lobster bisque - it was great. I could probably just eat that with a good slice of bread and that would be enough for lunch.

Bandido something pannini - gosh... go easy on that mayo. It's not a bad pannini but it is overloaded with mayo. Hopefully someone in a corporate office is reading yelp.

Greek salad - meh... it's a salad... and it has feta cheese in it so I guess it's enough to be called greek.

Bottom line: if I'm in the area during lunch I might think about going there although there are other options available close by."}
{"text":"I've never ate here before and decided to try it. Once I tried a South Side Panini , I knew I would love this place. The food there is great . I recommend this restaurant! 10/10"}
{"text":"A bit pricey for the quality--cheap deli meat. At least the sandwiches are a creative mix of flavors. Pasta salad was yummy. Wish there had been more of it. Girl at the counter looked pissed the whole time I was in there.  Not friendly or helpful. Guy who made the sandwich was super fast."}
{"text":"I love here!!
They use to have lobster soup.
It was amazing 
I wish they make again this soup"}
{"text":"We were driving by (for the 50th time) and finally decided to pull in and look at the menu.  There has been a banner hanging outside that reads, \"$5.00 after 5:00 p.m.\"  We like that!

We had just come from the movies which means I had eaten most of a large popcorn and so wasn't really hungry. We decided to split a sandwich and chose the \"Wise Guy\".  This had Capocolla, mortadella, hard salami, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, roasted red peppers, pepperoncini peppers, provolone and basil mayo on wheat bread.  Wow!!!!  It was delicious.  

About a week later we were still talking about this sandwich and so decided to visit again.  This time (I think it was a Monday) we each got our own sandwich and were also treated to a cookie alongside it.  It is a special thing they do on Mondays.  Again the sandwich was delicious.  In fact, I could eat it right now.  I haven't tried anything else yet, but will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What thoughts do the name Spicy Pickle conjure in your hungry little head? Picture this; rockin' panninis, homemade pasta salad, fresh salads, and happy workers--all with a giant pickle on the side!

Overall, Spicy Pickle was a nice experience for a new chain restaurant. I went in during rush lunch hour on a Tuesday and placed a to-go order that took a little longer than expected, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. Meh, it may be a little pricey, but it was worth it!

Plus, the Spicy Pickle sign just makes me happy! Who loves giant pickels?! I DO! :)"}
{"text":"I went to a Spicy Pickle in Arizona and loved it, so I was really excited when I discovered there was one here.  Talked it up to the husband, finally convinced him to go.....and what a disappointment it was.  Portions were a lot smaller than I remember, and it didn't taste great.  Definitely not worth what we paid.  Quiznos/Subway quality at Panera prices?  No thanks."}
{"text":"So coincidentally, I decided to give this place another try after I wrote this review, and I can't say that I will be back. I am changing my review from 3 stars to 1 just because of the ridiculousness that was my sandwich. I asked for no cheese, add avocado. Simple right? Apparently not because about 80 percent of the time I have asked for avocado (and it costs an extra 75 cents mind you) I haven't received it. You think I would just learn and stop asking for it, but I tried again. This time they gave me cheese and no avocado. Apparently this is the hardest thing this place has to do because they can NEVER get it right. And this time they actually added something I specifically said not to. So eff you Spicy Pickle. I am breaking up with you.   5/1/11

----------------------------------------------------------

Working in an office is sort of like searching through yelp. Your coworkers bring in lunch from random lunch places you didn't know existed, and then you file them away in your bookmark section of your brain to try later and review. Spicy Pickle is one of those places I had no idea existed. I moved to this area of town almost two years ago and I am still finding new places to try. Its like a food expedition every time I go out. I had seen one of my coworkers bring in Spicy Pickle about four times before I decided to try it late last year. I have been here at least seven or eight times by now, but lately I just have not been that impressed.

When I first came to spicy pickle I was excited about another sandwich place to try. You see, I love sandwiches. You give me two pieces of bread with any combination of dressings, mayos, and veggies in between them and I am one happy girl. I don't know if the excitement got to me or what but for at least a month after I found this place I was in here every week at least. Its right down the street from my work as well so that made it super convenient. I have only had the Bastille sandwich, but of course I customize it to my tastes. I skip the cheese, sub sun dried tomato mayo for basil mayo, and add avocado. It was pretty tasty. But then I don't know what happened. Maybe I ate it so much I got sick of it, or maybe I just realized it was only a sub par sandwich, but I fell out of love with Spicy Pickle. Every time my husband wants to come here now I make a face. Maybe its because they added on a side with every sandwich as well as raising their prices. I'd rather have no side and less expensive sandwiches, thanks. 

BUT! There is one thing I continue to love about Spicy Pickle, and you guessed it. Its the pickles. They are so spicy and crunchy and I love that. I have a hard time finding a spicy pickle at the store that I like. Maybe I need to learn to make my own. But anyways. It has been a few months now since I have been here and I haven't had a craving to return. Perhaps one day I will. But for now I will continue to think about their pickles and wish I could just buy them by the jarful."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, great pizza, great variety, I've been here twice with a group of over 8 each time, most of us order something completely different and everyone always loves the food. The restaurant is nice looking and clean and they have a huge outside dining area as well. With several vegetarian options, friendly staff and delicious food, this gets highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here probably two weeks after their grand opening and it was still a bit empty but that just meant the food was going to be quick! I did the pick 2 deal which was about $8. I tried some spicy turkey sandwich which wasn't that spicy even when the cashier warned me about it. I also tried the seafood/crab soup and that was a winner especially with the sandwich to dip in it. The pickle spear was delicious, wish it was bigger. Overall it's a good sandwich place to eat at if you like options, open spaces, and an okay price. 
My four stars goes to the service mainly because the workers came by not once but twice to see if everything was alright. Maybe that's because we were the only family in there but still."}
{"text":"i love this place.  to be honest, i've only had one sandwich...the sausilto bandito.  it's great.  i always try to order something new, but i always crave this one.  

they also serve pizza and salads as well."}
{"text":"I think this place is a great lunch spot!

I have been twice and both times got the combo. The crab bisque is awesome, panini's and salads are both really good.  I will stopping by every time I have to stop at Lowe's"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place.  I've been here four times now and two times have had bad food experiences.  The first time I ordered a chicken wrap and the chicken was the WORST chicken ever.  I think it's the cheap Tyson or Hormel chicken that you get in the freezer section that I wouldn't even feed to my dog.  I ended up unwrapping the wrap and getting all the fillings except for the chicken.

I decided to give it another go.  Got the Bandido and the bread wasn't cooked all the way through.  I tried and tried to keep eating, but just couldn't stand the mushiness from the bread.  I kept examining it to make sure it was the bread because the flavors were very good, but ended up tossing more than half the sandwich :(

The other two times I did not have a bad experience and the staff is polite, that's why I gave it three stars.  I'm not sure I will try it again because I really would like a great lunch for $8.00+ dollars."}
{"text":"Poor, poor, poor!!

I ordered the Med sandwich.  I opted out of the red wine vinegrette and instead requested for the spicy ranch sauce.  I also ordered a side of cole slaw.

1. I opened the cole slaw and immediatly noticed that it wasn't a mayo based cole slaw.  Alright no problem.  Mayo based is my favorite, but i enjoy vinegar based slaw as well.  First bite, no flavor.  2nd bite, no flavor.  I see some kind of liquid has been added, but it wasn't vinegar.  I'm not sure what it was but it was absolutely flavorless.  Didn't finish it!  Plain shredded cabbage is not coleslaw!!

2. My sandwich.  I opened it up, and found no spicy ranch sauce, and no red wine vinegrette.  It was a completely dry sandwich.  Dissapointing to say the least.  I goto the fridge, and get my bottle of creamy parmesan ranch and ate the entire sandwich.  It was good despite the bread being a bit on the dry side.

3. The first 2 complaints wouldn't have been enough for me to leave this negative feedback.  It's this third complaint that was the icing on the cake.  When i bit into my sandwich, i bit down into something a bit hard.  Not enough to crack teeth, but enough to let you know, something isn't right.  i spit it out, and it was a chunk of lettuce core.  How cheap and/or lazy do you have to be, to not spend 10 seconds to core your lettuce before shredding it?!  Really!!"}
{"text":"I've only visited this place once and so far so good. I do plan on going back and trying other sandwiches :)"}
{"text":"As the other reviewers stated, this place is pricey, and doesn't necessarily match the quality you pay for, although it is palatable, cost aside.  Portions are decent, and wait time was long.

I ordered a South Side, which is roast beef and cheddar on focaccia.  The bread was shipped in, possibly a day or so old, not fresh and certainly not baked on site.  Roast beef was standard deli cut (probably from a deli) and not on site, as well the cheddar.

The place was moderately crowded for lunch, but the wait was terribly long, so long that a manager decided to stop by and ask how long I was waiting.  New help in the kitchen?  Perhaps.

Bring the prices more in line with what the place is trying to sell, and I'll return.  This isn't a gourmet deli."}
{"text":"Lets see... Where to begin?? The staff was extremely unfriendly.! I ordered the Gobbler and cheese and broccoli soup. My Gobbler bread was stale and hard, no tomatoe mayo, no feta cheese, only 1 artichoke scarcely spread on my sandwich. It was the driest, grossest sandwich ever! The soup was super bland and gross!! It was the WORST meal for $10! What a waste!! Never ever go here! I hope this place shuts down again and stays out of business!! Gross!!"}
{"text":"Better than Subway if you're looking for a quick bite for lunch. Also they keep the place nice and clean. Try the Bandido Pannini, it's my favorite."}
{"text":"I wanted to love you Spicy Pickle, but it was your pickle I liked best. I had the Bandito panini with Peppered turkey, pepperjack, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, chipotle mayo. I took the sandwich to go and by the time I got to eat, it was pretty soggy. The blend of flavors didn't save it. I'll have to give it a second chance and dine in, maybe try a specialty sandwich instead."}
{"text":"The food and service is great HOWEVER For the meal that is provided its way over priced. You're already paying over 8$ a sandwich but for the build your own combo its the exact same price but they charge you for avocado charge you for bacon,not as an extra but as a main part of the sandwich in general. They offer pasta salad potato salad orange slices with a spicy pickle as a side. But by orange slices they mean 3 and they don't offer any sort of dill pickle for kids."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot for lunch with a wide selection of sandwiches and soups. Food is made fresh to order. Generous outdoor seating area for those nice days. Nice to be able to get a free combo when you check in on Yelp."}
{"text":"I was always told they are SOOO good so when I was down there working in the area I took my lunch break there and it was  good but I still thought a little $ for what the quality of food was?? But seemed like a popular place the business people from the area go ?"}
{"text":"Favorite spot for a quick sandwich.  Salads are fresh and healthy and sandwiches are the perfect comfort food.  Husband and I go twice a month.

9 times out of 10 the employees are friendly and quick to help.  Once in a blue moon, the teenagers are a tiny bit cranky but that has never affected my meal! 

Must try- spinach salad and Gobbler sandwich."}
{"text":"Though I'm not a sandwich eater, I come to this place for the soups and of course the spicy pickles.  Every soup that I have tried here is nothing short of amazing.  My fave is the SW chicken chili, absolutely wonderful.  The pickles...  My oh my....  If I could make these myself I would be in heaven.  I'm addicted to them.  They are the best ever.  

This place is super convenient to where I work, so I come here 1-2 times a month, my only complaint are the prices...  Not really a complaint but there are cheaper places, but then again, they don't have the pickles, lol."}
{"text":"Amazing paninis & soups! Best pickles!!
Customer service is great- quick service, always smiling.
LOVE this place!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice thanks to Groupon...and it may be awhile until I return. The first time Groupon decided to work on its site when I wanted to pull up my Groupon on my phone so I couldn't use it and had already ordered so ended up paying full price. Not a happy camper.

 It has good food and a nice seating area, but it is a little overpriced for such small portions. The paninis are on a big piece of bread but have the smallest amount of contents! The soup was good but not anything I would make a special visit here for. The Greek salad was also good but lacked on toppings. Everything is very fresh, which they charge you for, but you don't get much of it. My pizza crust was literally BLACK from being burned so bad. Sadly I did take out on my that visit and did not realize it until I got home. Needless to say I threw half of my $10 mini pizza away. 

For being a \"fast service\" place their prices were very high and both times I went in the only other people there were employees, sitting at the tables eating. No wonder they put a Groupon out, business must be slow!"}
{"text":"I feel compelled to write a negative review of this place after giving it a second try since it's constantly listed as a recommended lunch place in my \"nearby\" search. To say the quality of the food here is \"mediocre\" is an overstatement. A compliment in fact. Because frankly the food is barely edible. What's worse, one of my pet peeves is when a food establishment calls its food one thing when it's not actually the case. I believe that's called lying. Or at the very least, false advertising. Like when a restaurant claims their orange juice is fresh squeezed when it is actually from a bottle (you know who you are, Eat), or in the case of this terrible place, calling frozen chicken that's been microwaved as grilled. I mean come on. In what world is that the same thing? You can't just get fresh chicken and grill it if you're gonna call it grilled? Such a disappointment when I've paid $10 for my sandwich and taken it to go only to unwrap it and realize it is NOT AT ALL what I expected. Not to mention it tastes bad and is totally unhealthy! Anyway. Never going back here and I hope they read this and revise their descriptions to reflect the truth about the shitty ingredients they offer."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure what to expect after reading the other reviews on here...wasn't super impressed with the service. Nobody said anything when I walked in, but got a few stares from employees...placed my order (corn and green chili bisque and 1/2 of a Bandido panini). 
Bisque was deeeeelicious! Huge fan! Panini looked a little bit like it had just been defrosted, flavor was ok, nothing to rave about. The pickle was, indeed, spicy! Crisp and tasty. 
Total was just over $8, not including a drink. 
There were only a few other people in the restaurant, whereas the Firehouse Subs place a few stores down was jam packed.
Seems to be family run, they're more concerned with each other than the customer, and being polite doesn't seem to be important (in person or on the phone)."}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot to write about this place, except that it is a great deli. I'm relieved to get a sandwhich, soup and salad from a place that is not 'fast food'.
I stop here for lunch when I'm in the Henderson area. The prices are steep, but you're paying for quality and that yummy spicy pickle."}
{"text":"I like the Groupon deal for Spicy Pickle better than I like most of the food at Spicy Pickle. What can I say? I like a value. But I'm a soup and salad master, so I come back for that alone.

Staff is usually very friendly. I bonded with Miranda particularly because it's rare to find another Miranda in Vegas. Sirius XM's The Blend will fill your ears as you order a signature panini or sandwich...or do what my man does and spend 5 minutes contemplating ingredients and creating your own. The selection of meats, sauces, and cheeses they have aren't fully represented in their signature recommendations. There's a lot more in the kitchen than meets the eye.

I've enjoyed the Yard Bird the most. The Brooklyn secures second place. Whoever made my Bandido put two handfuls too many of red peppers on it. Not my style. Atkins diet beware! My sandwiches are often way too bready. Plus, you get a slice of bread with your soup. Too much bread at times.

The Spinach Salad is a great contrast if you want the potato soup without a carb overload. The apple, walnut, bleu cheese, and vinaigrette cuts through the creamy soup and has you going back for one and then the other alternately.

Trust me on the potato soup. That's about all I can guarantee."}
{"text":"Was in the area when they were actually open, but can't say I'll be rushing back. This place used to be one of my favorite sandwich places, but how the mighty have fallen. Had to wait 15 minutes for my sandwich when I was the first person in the place. Ordered the Santa Cruz, no tomato. I usually do no lettuce, but it was listed as romaine, which I like, so I left it on. When it arrived, what do you know, it's iceberg (which I detest) and shredded to boot, so it's hard to pick off. When I mentioned it to the guy who served me, he said \"it is romaine\". Not even close, sorry. No worries, I don't like to waste food, so I picked it off. Unfortunately, the sandwich was pretty much flavorless, which you wouldn't expect since it has corn relish, avocado (spread) and Chipotle mayo. The thick bread soaked it all up :( The macaroni salad was also flavorless and undercooked. What a shame. Won't be making any effort to come back. I'll stick to Zupas or Capriottis."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places. I am a huge fan of their vegetarian sandwich (The Garden). It just has an amazing texture from the mozzarella cheese. And the vinaigrette they use. I also like their flatbread pizza. Also, their signature spicy pickles are really really good. 

I will honestly say that it is a long trip fr my house. But when I in in the neighborhood of Henderson, I like dropping by.  

There is plenty of space, and very clean. They also offer catering!"}
{"text":"Food look like it was old. After looking at the pickle started looking at the rest. The sandwich was good, but that shriveled up pickle had me wondering about the rest inside."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was surprised. I've been told in the past that this place was expensive...but you get a lot of food. I ordered the Adobe panini. It came with a pretty big sandwich (bread is thick), pasta salad or salad, and a pickle. All that for $7.99...seems ok to me. Btw, if you sign up for their newsletter, you receive a coupon for a free meal during your birthday month."}
{"text":"Guilt-free guilty pleasure. Great for those days when you want to eat something delicious without feeling greasy after. I had one of their panini's and and loved it. I wish they stayed open a little later."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sandwich places in Henderson.  Only issue is that it is a bit pricey.  But, personally, it is worth it compared to Quiznos and Subway.  However, it is cheaper than Panini Bread.
I can't remember the name of the sandwich that I usually order (never good with names), it has corn, slicked turkey, and sundried tomatoes on a pressed panini.  I think the bread makes this sandwich tastes so good.  Because it is only like 5 minutes from my house, I normally stop by weekly...."}
{"text":"Very seldom will I ever go any place and order anything without some sort of meat in it.  When at the SP I am drawn to the De Luca gourmet panini with all of it's non animal flesh glory.

SP is cool and on my last visit an extremely affable gentleman recommended his version of a bbq chicken pizza.  His enthusiasm for his special pizza caused me stray from my normal vegi sandwich order.  It was a damn good pizza."}
{"text":"Its like Panera, but without the focus on healthy choices or flavor. Everything on the menu sounds decent, but nothing has any flavor. As others pointed out, the peppered turkey has no pepper accent whatsoever.

Tried the pick two combo- half a sando, half a salad, and a spicy pickle for about $8. GOBBLER sandwich (peppered turkey, feta, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato mayo) had little to no feta nor artichoke hearts, as I could not detect them at all in the sandwich that I consumed. The PARISIAN salad (grilled chicken, bleu cheese, EVOO mayo, avocado, bacon, red onion) sounded tasty, if remarkably unParisian- but it was presented thrown together with minimal toppings, and sided with a huge heap of guacamole, which went with neither dish on the plate? Guess they know their food has no flavor, and that must be their attempt to fix it?

Service was polite, plate was delivered to my table after ordering, but I was never checked on to ask about the discrepancies with my dishes. Manager/owner appeared to be chatting with friends at the front counter for the duration of my visit, wish she had been more involved in the service- maybe the dishes would have come out correctly.

They do have a Yelp check-in offer for free drink/chips upgrade with your order."}
{"text":"Spicy Pickle delivered sandwiches to the office for a training and after having heard about them, I was impressed.   The Panini's were good, I had the Adobe and it was excellent except a bit heavy on the corn.   The other sandwiches seemed to go over well with the crowd.   For a \"boxed lunch\" type delivery these guys did a good job - shame the name is pretty horrible."}
{"text":"Lame name.  Not so lame sandwiches.  

I like it spicy.  Interpret that as you wish, but when it comes down to it -- it takes a lot more than spicy pickles to impress me - say gigantic and decadent choco chip cookies. Don't let the gimmicky name fool you, however, these are some serious sandwiches at Spicy Pickle, a franchise with only one location in the Valley in Chandler.  I found the quality of food and scope of sandwiches offered to be comparable to Dilly's Deli. 

I had a lunch earlier this week catered from this place, and since they catered half-sized portions I was able to try two: the Santa Cruz sub and wiseguy sub.

I found the wiseguy (with italian meats and cheeses) sub to be pretty tasty, but I prefer my subs to not swim in oil and vinegar.  The Santa Cruz sub was pretty good though (and my favorite of the two) - with its ingredients of Mesquite turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, corn relish, cheddar and chipotle mayo.

The highlight of the lunch were these large thick discs that looked and tasted like chocolate chip cookies.  Crispy on the edges and moist and soft in the middle.  Seriously, one of the better cookies I have had in a long time.

BTW, the pickles are sprinkled with some kind of chili powder and are ok, perhaps they're awesome -- I don't know, I'm not a big pickle fan."}
{"text":"My sisters and I voted, 7.5 out of 10. Decent sandwiches, very clean and good customer service."}
{"text":"Seafood Bisque!! Do it!!
the Groupon as rad, but it sold me on the place. It's like less pretentious, but similarly prices Panara. I get something different every time and have liked each item."}
{"text":"Where's the meat??

Why did I just pay $20 for two sandwiches I can make at home. Beach hut deli, I'm sorry for leaving you.. Will you please take me back?! 

Someone tell the cashier that it doesn't hurt to smile."}
{"text":"We ordered the 1/2 pizza and tuna salad combo. Nothing special. The pickles were very spicy and the most memorable. Not rushing to go back."}
{"text":"Love the food from here. Wish the hours were longer and the food prices a little cheaper. But, the soup and sandwiches I have had from here are divine. The DeLuca is awesome. It opens at 7:30am and I think closes at 6pm. The staff is generally nice and they bring the food out to you. They do have seating inside and outside."}
{"text":"While the sandwiches appear large, they are overstuffed with lettuce and very little meat. The Panini bread was ok. I opted for the pasta salad for my side which seemed very dry. The pickle on the side, however, was delish. 

The service was excellent, quick and friendly. The restaurant was very clean but the claustrophobic, cattle-shoot feel to their entrance and crowded ordering counter was a put off.

All-in-all it was okay, not fantastic for the price.  Two Paninis and two drinks for $21 including tax."}
{"text":"If you can appreciate a good sandwich..this is the place to go! This was my first time going there and I had the sausilito bandido..soo good! Subway can suck it!"}
{"text":"Fast service great salad! The atmosphere is trendy and this is a great choice for lunch. I had the Chicken Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Fresh sandwiches. Fast service. And Happy Hour from 3-5:30pm is a great deal- buy one get one half off. 

I have had the panini and turkey sandwich. Pasta salad and coleslaw...fresh."}
{"text":"Very delicious and fresh food! I get the Greek salad almost everyday. The people are friendly and they recently started offering a rewards program. Stay away weekdays at noon. VERY SLOW to get your food during this time. Other than that two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for lunch on a weekend. It's a sandwich and salad spot where you order at the counter, self service drinks, and they will bring your food to the table. It took about 5 minutes for them to prepare the food. 

We both ordered the roast beef sandwich. It was quite large, plenty of meat, decent veggies, and served on focaccia bread. The bread was a bit much, but overall the sandwich tasted good and was filling. I was only able to eat half of the sandwich- maybe next time I'll try the half sandwich and salad.

The service was exceptional. We were checked on three times during our meal and they brought to go containers to the table. 

Overall, this is a better alternative to the traditional sandwich shops (subway, Quiznos, etc). A sandwich and drink will cost you ~$10."}
{"text":"I always get the Santa Cruz for lunch. It is always great. The side of coleslaw not good but the macaroni salad is bomb. Beware it does take a while for them to make it though..."}
{"text":"I first visited this Spicy Pickle location shortly after they opened, and experienced a VERY long wait time (10 minutes) for a simple panini that wasn't nearly toasted enough and a side of pasta salad. Assuming that this was merely because the staff was new and there was a big lunch rush there, I figured it would be worth another chance. Based on my second experience, I don't think I will be giving them a third chance.

The dining area only had a few patrons, and there was no line when I got to the counter. I ordered a combo with a half Basque panini and a green chili corn bisque soup (about $8) and stepped aside to wait for my order. FIFTEEN minutes later, after several other orders were brought to tables or given to other take-out patrons, the employee who was expediting food asked me, \"Are you Lisa?\" No, I'm not Lisa. He shuffled through a few tickets (where he obviously didn't find mine), asked me what I had ordered, and then asked the gal making sandwiches where my order was. She said gruffly, \"I don't have anything for Amy.\" Great. Instead of apologizing for making me wait needlessly, they slapped together a sandwich that was 50% apple, 25% mustard, 24% spinach and 1% ham and then put it on the panini press for about 10 seconds. I will say the soup was delicious, but all they had to do was ladle that into a cup. I not only waited while nearly every other patron dining in and taking out received their orders before me but I was then rewarded by receiving a half-assed sandwich assembled by ambivalent staff. The ratio of ingredients made for a very weird flavor. A mustard-coated granny smith apple sandwich is not what I ordered.

Lunch rush sandwich places are a dime a dozen, and I am lucky to have quite a few options close to my office. It's great to have something a little more special than the Subway across the street, but with so many dining choices, customer service is key. I'm disappointed that the inordinately long wait times and poor customer service I experienced when they opened weren't just growing pains."}
{"text":"Literally the only place I enjoy paninis. Theirs are soft and warm with a nice crust. I typically order the adobe, bastille or bandido but have tried many more. Great lunch spot (I have unfortunately not tried breakfast yet)."}
{"text":"This place is okay at best, and definitely over priced.  I ordered the \"gobbler\" which was supposed to have turkey (had about 1.5 pieces of lunch meat) and artichoke hearts (saying I had a total of 1 heart is being generous).  I had gotten it to go or else I would have definitely had them make a new one.  I won't return, it's definitely not worth the price...."}
{"text":"I think I kind of hated this place. Maybe hate's too strong a word. My sandwich was blah. The flavors were bland and the texture was wet and overly soggy for a panini. I got the Sausalito and I tried the Seafood Chowder and Bastille from my girlfriend's plate. I think the prices are reasonable there is potential for a good sandwich, but I just didn't experience it this time. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is usually good but just waited over twenty five minutes for a sandwich to go. Should have gone to subway."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of lunch stops with good salads and sandwiches. Spicy Pickle is a welcome addition to this list. I've yet to try the pizetti (though it looks good) but the salads and sandwiches I've had have all been delicious. The spinach salad has apples, walnuts, and bleu cheese with an apple cider vinaigrette. Very tasty, though there was a bit too much vinnaigrette at my last visit.  There are several sandwich selections to choose from, but I think the best is to build your own from their list of ingredients.  There are deffinitely enough toppings to make a sandwich to your liking, and I highly recommend choosing the sundried tomato mayo as your spread! Several cheeses to choose from as well, with my favorite being the smoked mozerella. 
As if that wasn't good enough, I learned that Monday's are free cookie day! .Heaven. The chocolate chip cookie is soft - a little crunchy on the outside yet doughy in the middle. Perfect :)"}
{"text":"Overpriced for quality of sandwich. I got the yard bird. Sandwich was bland, bread was not fresh; almost stale which made the whole sandwich taste worse than it probably would have with fresh bread. The kids flatbread cheese pizza was decent. My 5yr old daughter said it was good. I won't be back."}
{"text":"As a recent transplant to this area I have found myself staring at the sign for the Spicy Pickle every time I turn from Eastern to St Rose Parkway.  I have no idea why it has taken over three months to make my first visit, but it will certainly not take three months for my next.

The seating area is clean and contemporary.  The menu is cool and quasi-healthy.  The ingredients tasted fresh on each of my wife and my sandwich and salad.

The staff was courteous and kind.  I will be back."}
{"text":"The pickle that comes with food here is about the only thing worth writing about. Otherwise, everything is just kind of boring and not worth the trip. There are so many other good places to get a sandwich or salad that are far superior. Skip this place and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"We love this place.  They have quite a few pescatarian options for us so this is a good place for a quick bite to eat.  Much better than your typical Subway fare.  We used to go to their Eastern location a lot.  Unfortunately they closed that location down.  This place is a little bit aways from us but their offerings before made it a must have after a day at the Outlets stores.  The cashier was very helpful and courteous.  Found out that they offer breakfast items now.  We normally order the Pick 2 menu offering but we ordered their regular sandwich items and we were surprised how big their serving was.  We could have shared the sandwich it was that big.  We will definitely be back for another lunch for sure.  Maybe we can even try their breakfasts one day!"}
{"text":"We were not in the mood for cooking at home so we decided to forgo the typical Subway night and decided on Spicy Pickle.  I am glad we did.  We used to go there more often when we lived closer but we made our trek to their establishment.   Some sandwich shop really don't give alot of choices for pescatarians but Spicy Pickle has a few more choices.  They have what they call the Dilly-o meal which is half a sandwich and a side salad or soup.  This allows you to try two things at the same time.  I ordered the Sinker (tuna sandwich) and a cup of their double baked potato soup.   My partner ordered the Garden State (portabello and other veggies) and a side of tuna salad.  I love the way they prepare the tuna.  It is somewhat tinged with spice.  Their breads are fresh and not the typical torpedo or sliced bread but ciabattas and paninis.  We enjoyed our meal as always.  I wish they get more customers because I never see it packed.  This eating establishment is a nice alternative to other sandwich shops for sure."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunches.
Soups sandwiches aren't that bad.
Sit outside, oh yeah.


Ah not really a haiku but it pretty much sums up the whole Spicy Pickle experience. I'd like to add that their sandwiches are spicy cause it tastes like they use a lot of ground black pepper.  Reasonable priced and always busy when I go."}
{"text":"We bought a couple of Groupons and decided to try out Spicy Pickle after the Yelpified Office Hours the other day.

We split a med sandwich and Sonoma pizzetti.

The sandwich had roasted chicken, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, kalamata olives, cucumbers, pepperoncini peppers and feta, drizzled with Greek dressing. It was okay but not as good as I was hoping. It came with a pickle that was only spicy pickle. I was hoping for a more distinct pickle given the name of the joint but whatever.

The pizzetti had grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, fresh rosemary, mozzarella and tomato sauce. The sauce was a little sweeter than I like and the chicken was flavorless. However, the crust was really good. It was perfectly thin and crispy.

Overall, I'd give Spicy Pickle a 2.5. I'm rounding up as I really liked the pizzetti crust. We'll be back at least once more as I've got one more Groupon."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and very good customer service!! the girl was very friendly and very patient!! I was a new customer and took a while to look over menu. I loved my chicken salad wrap and other sandwiches were great!!"}
{"text":"This review is looooong over due.
My last 2 trips to vegas I ate every single meal in this establishment! I cannot stay away.  I love me a guuuud sammich and honestly for me, this place hits the G Spot. Salsalito Bandito with Avo? Whoa! Nirvana. I've been trying to tackle the entire menu, working from left to right.  Gonna skip the salads, and eventually get to the pizzas.  The soups are great, the bread fresh and flavorful. The design your own sandwich is fun too. Last time there I got a double roast beef with horseradish mayo, horseradish slaw, onions, tomato, and blue cheese. I call it the Steak House. lol If only they had onions carmelized in balsamic.  My sandwich would be complete and ready to be put on the menu. :)"}
{"text":"Soup?  What soup?  OK, it's 115 in Henderson today, but you could at least have a Gazpacho or a Chilled Cucumber soup.  No soups today, just sandwiches and salads.  My husband had the Italian panini and I had the Englishman (roast beef) on a roll.  My husband's was OK, though he was upset that the ice tea machine was dispensing water rather than tea.  My sandwich had more horseradish than beef.  The beef that was there was subpar.  Both of us had hardly enough meat to see, much less taste.  If you want a sandwich where you can see the meat, go to Smith's deli.  Why weren't we there ourselves?  Because sometimes it takes a hour for them to make a sandwich (they are not too organized).  Maybe I'll try this place again in the fall when the so-we-have-been-told delicious soups are on display."}
{"text":"Ooo a pickle that is spicy. Food was okay, but not really worth the price if you ask me!"}
{"text":"I went here with some co-workers and I was not impressed. This place serves expensive sandwiches that are not better than Jason's Deli. Don't get me wrong I am not a huge fan of Jason's Deli but if you want a pretty good sandwich go there.

I would have rated this place a 3 but the price dropped it to a 2."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I was working in Henderson but now it's too out of the way and not really worth it. We came here three night ago and they had changed their menu. They've removed their Englishman off the menu which was our favorite sandwich but offered to make it anyway. This sandwich is like a slaw-be-jo (roast beef, Russian dressing, coleslaw) from Capriottis but on their ciabatta bread. This was by far the best bite we had that night. 

I ordered some sort of Italian sandwich with mortadella and salami but something about it made it bland and  strange tasting. The peppercinis are nice but their roasted red peppers were mushy and gross. We ordered a kid's pizzetti which is just a pizza on thin flat bread. This was nothing special. 

When I used to frequent this place, I'd order the Greek salad with salami but it's close to $9 and way too easy to make at home. I guess if you want to spend a lot of money for a little food, go to the Spicy Pickle and order an Englishman and Greek salad but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"second visit at spicy pickle... but the first time i had a sandwich and soup. i don't remember which one I ordered but was delighted with the flavors. Spicy Pickle is kinda like panera bread. this time i ordered a zappa pizza. it came with 6 small squared slices the sauce was white that tasted like a cheesy alfredo sauce topped with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes on thin crunchy crust.  it was a different kind of pizza not like grimaldi's or pizza hut. i tasted home-made and was lighter because the crust was so thin. definitely a place to go for lunch!"}
{"text":"Whenever I say Spicy Pickle my stomach starts growling!

I've been chowing down their food since they opened.  I can't deny its the chicken chili bowl that makes me come back. One night they didn't' have it and I was so upset.  LOL I wish I had the recipe and make it myself.  *I think i'm hungry again*  = 0)  This is honestly what brings me back.

The paninis are my favorite.  I think their better than the regular sandwiches.  I think Ive tried most of them and had no complaints.

The Bronx is my favorite:  Corned beef, swiss, coleslaw and thousand island dressing

My 2nd is the Bandido (Roasted turkey, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, pepperjack and chipotle mayo)

Just recently I finally tried the caesar salad with chicken.  Man! They gave a lot.  I did do the 1/2 salad and small soup combo and thought it was a lot.  Or did I get lucky? hehehehe The salad dressing was yum and there were bits of artichoke in there.  

Now I want to try the other salads.  The pizza aren't my favorite here I have to admit.

Lunch gets busy here because of the hospital close by.  Staff is friendly and usually you don't' wait to long for your food."}
{"text":"This review is a bit overdue, but I think it is important to express my hesitance for visiting this location. I ordered two half sandwiches, a drink, a cup of soup, and a bowl of soup. I tipped a few bucks at the register before receiving my order. They asked if I wanted my receipt and I said no. When I received my order, I got two cups of soup instead of a bowl and a cup. I told the waiter I needed a bowl rather than the cup, because I received the wrong size. He then looked at the receipt they keep and told me that's not what I paid for. I am annoyed because it was miscommunication and my tip was more than enough for the difference of what I supposedly didn't pay. If I knew my order was wrong, I would have corrected it. Hah, I know I'm complaining, but it just made me annoyed that they didn't consider my tip. I know what ordered regardless if it was rung in wrong. Additionally, my signed receipt they kept only had the total price and not breakdown. What you need to know about the food is that it's pretty good, like Panera. The side pickles are very tasty. I miss the pickles, but boycott my treatment."}
{"text":"Very good little spot for lunch! Husband and I walk past here a lot while exercising & decided to give it a try. He had the Northend with pasta salad and I had the Basque panini with pasta salad. Really good portion sizes, I had to take some home. Very clean & cute inside and awesome service (:"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If I lived in the Vegas/Henderson area I'd become one of their regulars. Looks like there was one in San Diego but it closed. Definitely will go back to Spicy Pickle when I'm in Vegas next!"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time for dinner when I attended school at UOFP right across the parking lot. A little overpriced but a good little place for soup and panini's. My favorites were the Adobe panini, roma panini, Corn and green chili bisque (especially good with the Adobe panini to dip), and the broccolli cheese soup. Their potato salad is pretty good as well. Another negative besides the prices is that service is slow. However, I can say that the food it very tasty, the atmosphere is cute and quaint, and the pickles are indeed spicy   :O"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a panini and a seafood bisque. Place is nice inside and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"After making idiot faces through the window at the employees of Spicy Pickle, employees who were most likely tired after a long day of training, my husband and I were invited to lunch the next day- a training activity for the staff. Only friends and family were invited. We felt very special- either to be considered part of the Spicy Pickle family, or maybe because we made such ridiculous fools of ourselves at the window that they thought we might be \"special\" in the other meaning. Perhaps.
Either way, free lunch.

It's not as though I could give a stinky review to anything given to me for free- I might feel bad- but this was just what the doctor ordered. 

Not for the weak at heart.

It's not just a clever name. Their pickles are actually spicy. They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder. A nice kick follows a good bite.

I ordered the Dilly something or other. It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup. I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini. Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test. Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose.
I could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white. I just have REALLY light skin. Never worked.

Al had the Aztec pizzeti. Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza. This looked like it fit the bill. Very think and crispy crust. A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that. She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup.

Mickey had the Gobbler with a side salad. When she bit into the panini she made a face that I think should remain in the bedroom. Enough said.

Bryan had the salad and enjoyed it immensely. It didn't look like much, but I might have to return when they open tomorrow and try it out for myself. The croutons did look very appetizing.

One of the attentive staff members made the rounds with a tray of mini chocolate chip cookies. Fantastic. Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Mama like.

All in all, I'll be back. Probably tomorrow. And maybe the day after...

AMENDMENT:
OK, so I did go back the next day... and today (which is the following day). Yesterday I had the tuna salad, which was delish. Theur tuna is a little kicked up, as it's made with chipotle mayo (but really not too much) and spoicy pickle relish. Tasty. It was served over a bed of greens with a lemon olive oil dressing.
Today I had the med sub. It was ok- nothing out of the ballpark. I got it with the spoinach salad, which was also delish. 

Down to 4.5, but alas no halfs...

Stick with the paninis and the salads. Maybe the soups too. I have yet to try the pizzetti... stay tuned."}
{"text":"Decent place to stop by for lunch outside of the strip. It was raining cats and dogs yesterday so their Make It 2 Combo of a half sandwich and bowl of soup was the perfect item to order! The broccoli and cheddar soup was creamy with the right ratio of broccoli to cheese. The Brookyln is a standard pastrami with coleslaw sandwich that is a local version of the Langer's #19 in Los Angeles. Portion size is perfect to fight hunger yet not cause and food coma. Success!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE NAME!

I HATE pickles.  Like H A T E pickles.  We eat at Firehouse Subs next to this location on a regular basis.  Everyone always comments on how does a place stay in business that just sells pickles.  Even our pickle fans found it odd but were intrigued.  

The other day there happened to be no parking except the spot closest to the Spicy Pickle front door.  We said what the heck and went in.  Holy crap!!!  Panini's!!!  One of my favorites.  I had the Italian and WOW!!  One of the best sandwiches I have had.  Both people with me got something different and both of them were equally impressed. 

How this place is called the Spicy Pickle instead of the Perfect Panini is lost on me.  Hoping they can stay in business despite the bad name.  The pickle on the side was given two thumbs up by the people eating with me, but mine went in the trash, where evil cucumbers belong."}
{"text":"Our flight arrived in Las Vegas around 9:30, but we were hungry for lunch (and lunch means sandwich) so we stopped here. Food was ok - I think I had a roast beef sandwich. The meat wasn't of exceptional quality, but it was just fine. Potato salad was good too. 

I liked being served on real plates with real cutlery. Just makes for a nice experience. 

Better than most \"fast food\" sandwich places."}
{"text":"Tried out this place yesterday for a carry-out dinner on my way home.  I rank it middle of the pack.  It definitely feels more satisfying, healthy, and pricey than your typical fast food burger joint, but not as creative or filling as something like Capriotti's.  

Between two of us we had the Bastille panini, large greek salad, and large chicken chili.  We thought all were quite flavorful, good combinations of ingredients.  The Bastille contains portabello, roasted red peppers, onions, tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts, and mozzarella.  Good stuff, and a good sized sandwich (filling, but not too much, don't expect leftovers).  The Greek salad and soup were tasty, but both were quite small for \"large\" sizes.  The soup was maybe 8 oz, one cup, which is actually pretty small as far as I'm concerned, especially for nearly $5.  

So, kudos to Spicy Pickle for quality, tasty, fast food, but for the price portions on some things are on the small side.  The service when I was there was incredibly friendly, and - opposed to other comments - my pickle was actually quite spicy."}
{"text":"I stop in here for lunch a few times a month. The ingredients are always fresh and they'll make the sandwich any way you want it.

Last week, a co worker and I ate outside and she ordered one of the sandwiches off the chalkboard menu. She didn't love it. But then the manager came over and apologized and said it came to his attention that her sandwich had made wrong. He brought her a new one immediately and she loved that one (the first one was missing cheese or something, I don't perfectly recall). What proactive service!

I won't be going back to Subway or PofS any time when there's a Spicy Pickle around!"}
{"text":"I've never been here without a groupon so I can't really comment on any price related matters.

My wife and I have a couple sandwiches we like, with the yard bird being out current favorite.  It has bacon, cheese, and apple on a turkey sandwich. Since they seem to love to do groupons we have been here five or six times recently and their quality is consistant.

The macaroni salad is a little dry, but the pickles are indeed spicy.

Probably not a must visit, but I'll be keeping an eye out for more coups and will return with those."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. 30 minutes after ordering and still no food. Employees are nice but how do you screw up a sandwich and make it take over 30 minutes   Lack of a manger maybe?  Never coming back. And the whole restaurant is waiting like me. A joke."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Spicy Pickle since their old location! Hands down the best soup in town! The seafood bisque is to die for! I tried a cup of the Southwestern bisque if I remember the name correctly.  And it was so delicious too! 

I also had half a flat bread pizza, and the presentation was so nice! As well as being very, very tasty.  (See the picture I uploaded.) The flavors are complex and the food is filling without having you feel \"weighed down.\" This is one of the reasons I dislike eating fast food like McDonald's which tends to make me feel tired and bloated afterward.

I was so full I did not eat for the rest of the night and took a slice home which was half of my breakfast the next day.  I am always conscientious of eating healthy avoiding all but complex carbs on a typical day so I asked a lot of questions from the guy who helped me about what he recommended etc. 

I am really picky about what I eat since I used to manage a family-owned \"Best of Las Vegas\" restaurant with my mother. And I am telling you this place is so delicious.

Like I referenced before, the guy was so helpful and patient.  Answering at least 5 minutes worth of my questions before my settling on my order.  He was so helpful in fact with his recommendations that I tipped him two dollars.

The decor inside is really pretty and bright.  The tables are modern and very clean.  There is even a cute statue of a cute cat.

Spicy Pickle is a local treasure! A must try...! Check out the seafood bisque! You will love it!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, 25 minutes for 1 sandwich, they forgot? No pickle with my sandwich, it's in the name. Over priced, bland, don't go here."}
{"text":"Nice, convenient place to go for sandwiches, paninis, soups and salads. My mom and I went here for dinner around 5:30 one evening and the place was empty. After looking over the menu at the counter, my mom ordered the Santorini Pizzetti (An individual 11\"  really thin/cracker crust pizza, also referred to as Neopolitan-style, covered in a thin layer of tomato sauce, mozzarella, feta, oregano, green peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, and kalamata olives, and then drizzled with extra virgin olive oil. I ordered the Garden State sandwich, which comprised of Portobello mushrooms (grilled I assume), tomatoes, red onions, roasted red peppers, spinach, and fresh mozzarella, drizzled with honey-balsamic vinaigrette, and layered between a ciabatta roll. I also ordered a small cup of Redrock Seafood Bisque, which came with a side of bread. 

After ordering and paying, we sat down at a booth and waited a few minutes before our food arrived. Immediately after tasting the soup, my mom said it was not hot enough, so I asked the cashier if she could tell the cooks to make the soup hotter, which she apologized for and took back. While waiting for the soup, my mom and I began eating our food. My mom enjoyed her Pizzetti, and I thought my sandwich was delicious. The veggies and mozzarella inside my sandwich tasted fresh, and every ingredient worked together, resulting in a healthy and mild-flavored sandwich. The ciabatta itself was perfect- the right amount of soft, the right amount of chewy, and the right amount of crusty crust. The complimentary pickle was okay, nothing extraordinary. 

After a few minutes of eating our food, the server came back with the soup and warned us that it was hot. Good thing she warned us because the soup was very hot, but oh so delicious. Creamy soup with chunks of seafood. Perfect on its own or with bread. For $3.29, it's a good deal. Overall, we enjoyed our food. I will be back."}
{"text":"May 2 2016:  this spicy pickle location is now closed for business.  it was open last week .. but apparently, they have closed the business."}
{"text":"This place is all in all okay. Let's not be over done about it, the sandwiches are small, tasty; but small nonetheless..... And the prices need to take a step down. What is it with these places sometimes? The longer they are in business and the more popular they get, the smaller and more pricey the food gets?!?! I only come here for a sandwich when I have a groupon. For this area, I'll take Beach Hut Deli, firehouse subs, or San francisco sourdough eatery over spicy pickle any day. An if it's the healthy your looking for, go down the street to eastern/ione and grab up some panera bread. Just keeping it real..... BOOM!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my the Gobbler Panini but it could have had more flavor. I requested Dijon mustard and sun dried tomatoes which were left off even though it was included on the order receipt. The spicy pickle was a nice addition. Their salad dressings are lite and tasty. I think I'll order again but will make sure they add more seasonings."}
{"text":"If you love panera bread you'll love the spicy pickle, it's healthy and refreshing . 
I had 1/2 1/2 combo and got the  Santa Cruz sandwich and loaded baked potato soup. OH MY GOODNESS DELICIOUS . 
The atmosphere was lovely , everyone was friendly and it seemed as if the workers kept it that way. The soup was creamy and matched well with the sandwich . 

Also don't forget to check in on yelp! You get free chips and a drink .

And of course it comes with a spicy pickle ;)"}

I think everyone working there used to be a door greeter at wal-mart they were so slow. even the guy at the cash register seemed like he was looking for a picture on the screen instead of the words.. overall i can just go across the way to panera bread if all else fails... oh but the spicy pickle itself. yeah it was delicious"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot!  If you're in the mood for a soup and sandwich, I always order the pick two with a wise guy and twice baked potato soup.  Just the right amount of grub to hit the spot.  Careful on your timing though... the lunch rush can get crazy."}
{"text":"**Update**  This Spicy Pickle is no more.   I went by today and the lights were out with a sign on the door saying they've closed.  Too bad it wasn't a McDonalds  :(



Yes the pickle is spicy and crunchy, I usually end up eating it.

I can't say the panini's are that great, I've had a couple that fell a little flat.  More like a quickly par-grilled sandwich than anything.  I've tried a couple of the sandwiches and they were fairly tasty - good bread, fresh meats & veggies, made well, decent flavor.

I do love the Forest salad - Spinach, Mushrooms, Grilled Onions, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Hazelnuts.  The Greek is good too, both were quite fresh & flavorful.  I've had a couple of the soups, ok, a little salty, but I find that all too often.

Fresh ingredients, clean, friendly service overall.  Not the greatest quick soup/salad/sammies ever for the price, but I've enjoyed it enough to try a few different sandwiches along with a salad which I've always enjoyed there."}
{"text":"Always down to trying new places. Having said that.... not impressed with the pickle!
Food was below standard... I ordered the chicken pizza with sun-dried tomatoes and fresh rosemary. First of all, no rosemary, secondly it came out wet! My crust was a soggy mess....
Definitely not worth the price, or my time for a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Excellent tuba sandwich. Great coleslaw. The \"pizza\" was good considering my husband thought it was going to be a sandwich. It was also good considering it was not the pizza we were used to. Good much alternative and much better than subway or those other chain sandwich places. Service was great and establishment was clean. Can't ask for much more ;-). Try the spicy pickle. Delish."}
{"text":"Eh... the food was good but not something I'd crave?  I had a chicken/swiss panini that evidently came with corn on it?

EDIT: (actually it was the Adobe Panini: \"Mesquite turkey, fresh mozzarella, green peppers, corn relish and chipotle mayo\".  I got called out that there wasn't anything on the menu I said I ate, got it a little wrong but the review remains the same regardless. Here you go Bob M.)

Slightly surprised on it but, can't complain... it was good but nothing great.

They have subs and soups too - I'd go there again if friends were already going but def not somewhere I'd really mention when trying to think of somewhere to eat."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!! Just finished my lunch and I could drive back for more! Perfect amount of food, great price, fun atmosphere, and DELICIOUS food! I have a weird obsession with pickles so you can imagine my excitement when I found this place! The spicy pickle was the perfect ending."}
{"text":"We had Spicy Pickle in Colorado and was very disappointed. But, we do like the one in Henderson. We do a build your own with roasted chicken, mayo, mustard, lettuce, cucumbers and that works for us. We also like the Wise Guys and the Bronx. The cookies are pretty good too. They are baked fresh in their store. I can't say much about the soup because its 100+ degrees in the summer, so I haven't tried it. 
The pick-a-dilly-yo is a good lunch special. Half Sand. w soup or salad. I've had the Caesar salad and its so-so.

Spicy Pickle is a franchise, so their menu's are the same but the sandwiches will vary in taste depending on their  demographics and where they get their vegetables from. The desserts are also different depending on their owner.   

They also do catering. Not sure on pricing...go check their website."}
{"text":"I really like this place for lunch.  Great salads, I've had the ceasar and the greek.  YUM.  I've had a couple of their sammies... turkey and bacon with avocado and other goodies.  Love their bread.  And yes, the pickle is definitely spicy - but really good!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for some time.  Got a coupon, so the wife and I had lunch there today.  I had a half sandwich (The Englishman) and soup (Loaded Baked Potato) and she had a half sandwich (The Southside) and soup (Broccoli Cheese).  Great tasting all around, but I was unimpressed with the quantity of meat on the sandwiches. I would go middle of the road and give two and half stars, but I just won't go to three, so I rounded down."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I wish there were more options for side choices. I don't always like paying $1.00 for a bag of chips. If you want something a little different give Spicy Pickle a try. Portions are appropriate site, in other words not huge."}
{"text":"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo
( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.  
On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if you're craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."}
{"text":"I made my 2nd trip back to Spicy Pickle. I was sure pleased! 

This time I tried the \"Brooklyn\" which had Turkey Pastrami, Swiss, Coleslaw, and Thousand Island dressing on rye. It was a panini. It also came with a side of macaroni salad.

The sandwich as very tasty. The Coleslaw was crunchy and fresh. The Thousand Island dressing added a nice touch and they weren't shy on it which I liked since I like extra dressing on anything.

The macaroni salad was unlike any other I ever had. It maybe had an Italian dressing on it? I'm not sure but it was fresh and tasty. There were crunchy fresh pieces of celery and onion in it. 

I had my own drink so the meal cost $7.56. I was yet again very pleased and will for sure be back! I think I will try their flat bread pizza next!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food here is not only amazing, but also very affordable. I was impressed by the quality and flavor of the food here the first time I went. Plus, every time I come back to order something new, I am impressed again! 

I love their panini and regular sandwiches; both are equally delicious. And to go with your tasty meal, you also get, don't act too surprised, a pickle! Now, this isn't just any sandwich pickle, it is their very own pickle and it is quite good. One of my favorites! To top it off, they often have $5 meals after 5pm - a good deal!

I used to go here all the time when I lived in Chandler and now sadly go less frequently because I live downtown. I hope they open a location in downtown soon!!"}
{"text":"I love spicy. 
I love pickles. 
So, when I drove by the name totally caught my eye. I had to drop in. And to my surprise, it's a soup, salad, sammich, panini, pizza spot. I, literally, died and went to heaven =)

The first time I went there, I had their Bastille panini which is portobello, red peppers, onions, tomatoes, alfalfa, and mozzarella...talk about refreshing!!! My picky mom had a bite and loved it, too..
Since then I've samps'd most, if not all, their paninis; some subs; couple salads...and I love them ALL!!!!!
I have yet to try their pizzas =( I know, I suck!

Thankfully, it's close to my house so, I'm sure I'll samps 'em sooner over later..."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and soups are delicious! The kids that work there are very nice and customer service oriented. It makes me happy to see a business that hires teenagers in this economy since I know that working around child labor laws are difficult and it is so easy to hire undocumented workers in this area. When this place opened up my friends and I went here for like a week straight but then I looked on their site and found how many calories are in these sandwiches. That was a shocker but it truly is delicious!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice. Quality of food is not the best and I feel like both times I've visited I felt like I didn't get my money's worth with the quality of food. This place is located by my work so I'd hope this might be my go-to place for lunch.

I got the Spinach salad which has spinach, fresh apples, walnuts, bleu cheese, and apple cider vinaigrette. Chicken weren't even strips. They were really really tiny cubes as if they bought it at Fresh and Easy. I mean the whole salad didn't feel fresh. It felt very store bought. 

The good thing is is that they have a check-in offer, but even that they didn't know about. The service is very friendly and nice, but I swear it doesn't balance with the quality of their food.

Tried it once it was ok. Tried twice, still ok. Third time...probably won't be a third time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a long time. You would never guess this is a national franchise. Don't let the name fool you as the pickle isn't that spicy. They also have Cholula sauce and a great pasta salad."}
{"text":"I used to go here all the time, went back recently and they have upgraded their presentation of how they serve your food if you eat in.  The sandwiches are still just as good.  I always get their half sandwich and half salad.  The pizzitis are good tasting, you just don't get a lot for your money if you are hungry.  Great spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area and was hungry so I used the Android Yelp App to search for Sandwich joints in the area.  Found this one and decided to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did.

I ordered the Wise Guys Sub (Capocolla, Mortadella, Hard Salami, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Roasted Red Peppers, Pepperoncini Peppers, Provolone, and Basil Mayo) on Ciabatta Bread $6.99, a bag of Jalapeno Chips $.80, and a Bottle of Water $1.99.

The food came out within a few minutes.  The size of the Sandwich was just right....not too big and not too small.  I eagerly took a bite and was impressed with the flavor that the Roasted Red Peppers brought to the Sandwich.  I've had a lot of Italian Sandwiches and have never had one with Roasted Red Peppers.....additionally, the Basil Mayo added another element to the Sub which made it very good.  The proportion of Meat and toppings was very good.

The only complaint is that with all of that wet stuff in the Sandwich, the ingredients were sliding off the Bread and it took some work to keep it all together.  I didn't dock them any stars for that....it's more of a preference thing.

Of course the Sandwich came with a Spicy Pickle.....which I didn't think was too Spicy at all.....nice flavor though.  Would have enjoyed a really Spicy Pickle.....was hoping for one.

Will I return?  I live on the other side of town and rarely come to Egypt....but next time I'm near the area, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Where's the flavor?? Tasteless. The prices do not match the portions of food given. Decided to give this place a shot after driving by it everyday but will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went for the first time the other day and the girl who greeted and rang me up was very friendly and helpful. I had the Yardbird panini with a couple changes and loved it. I can't wait to try other things so I can bump it to a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"We've been driving past this place ever since moving and it was time to finally stop in and find out what a place called \"Spicy Pickle\" actually serves.

Turns out it's subs, paninis, salads and little pizza-esque creations and the verdict is this is some tasty stuff. The italian panini was great. Very flavorful and a decent sized portion.

It's good to have one more place close to home that I know I'll be happy with. Looking forward to trying out some of the other menu options."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out after reading some of the reviews.

Cute Concept, Lots of Panini's, subs, salads, soups and Pizzetti to choose from Plus a huge \"build your own\" list of ingredients for your sandwich.
I didn't see the cookies everyones been talking about??

They have a wonderful patio area with covered umbrella tables and a water feature (See pics)

I ordered a panini and a small salad, my guest had a sub.(see pics)
And I mean really look at the pics! 

I Only wish it had tasted as good as it looked.  

My panini called for Swiss cheese, but unfortunately it was that processed imitation rubbery chalky kind ,my guests sub said cheddar but arrived with processed American. 
Very disappointed in that, my panini would have been 10 times better with REAL SWISS Cheese. Both sandwiches were a little bland, and the focaccia on the panini had and overpowering flavor.

The salad was delicious though, I was glad. Fresh crisp apple , generous blue cheese crumbles and just the right amount of dressing.(see pics)

I think they should have had a condiment counter, with the individual packages or something. I would have like to been able to grab some mustard and thousand island without having to go ask at the counter.

To me this was just an average sandwich place, it just didn't do it for me.

**2.5 stars"}
{"text":"this place was just OK. i had a coupon for a free entree for my birthday since I am a member of their pickle club and they were super nice about letting me use it. They were pretty busy and I had quite a bit of a wait, i didn't mind because I was headed home but if I was on my lunch hour it would have been frustrating...

The Aspen wrap was good, but for about 8.00 it was like other Yelpers mentioned pretty skimpy on the meat...

The workers were nice and when they ran out of soup before they finished a man's order I saw the manager make it right..

hopefully these are just opening kinks..."}
{"text":"Maybe I just ordered the wrong things or they were having an off day. I ordered the make your own with corn beef, swiss and mustard on ciabatta. I had a 2 for 1 flyer so I got a sandwich for the hubby  to go and mine to stay. I also got a large drink because they used to have great fresh brewed tea. I was so disappointed when I went to the beverage bar and it was gone and has been replaced with a multi tea dispenser thats cartridge based. I took a seat and waited a while as it seemed they only had one cook even though it was prime lunch time on a Friday. 

The girl who brought me my sandwich didn't say a word even when I said thank you. My sandwich, the bread was awesome I have to say, but it was like 2 slices of corn beef and a thin sliver of swiss.  Their ad says our sandwiches are \"180 degrees from lunch meat on bread\" so what I got I wasn't really expecting. It was OK, but the beef was cold which I wasn't expecting or I would have had veggies added to it.

Overall it was just OK, I don't think I'll be rushing back...what is ironic is they had a sign that said \"they love us on Yelp\"..I guess I am just the oddball.."}
{"text":"So we went back after the Groupon for this place and I was officially turned into a \"not so big fan\" of this place.   We waited over 1 hour for our food and after that it was pretty close to not consumable.   We only ate it because we were there so long! 

Won't be going back....ever."}
{"text":"Great variety. Not just a sandwich place.  Plan on $10 a person. We all enjoyed our lunch."}
{"text":"Had the Sausalito Bandido panini since the girl at the counter suggested it. Sausalito turkey, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, pepperjack and chipotle mayo.  Not bad..  Has a nice kick to it as well, but a little to heavy for me.  Easy on the mayo next time, yah?  

Verdict: Reminds me of Earls of Sandwich inside Planet Hollywood except they have pizza and panini.  Would love to come back and try everything else.  Has potential. 3.5 out of 5"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to 4 stars based on the customer service I saw yesterday.

I was watching an employee (he wasn't wearing a nametag unfortunately) be VERY VERY patient with an elderly couple.  He would describe all the sandwiches in great detail.  The couple wasn't sure they wanted cheese on one of the sandwiches, he offered to have the sandwich made with cheese on only one half.

Later when he delivered my food he noticed me fiddling around on my HTC EVO 4G.  He mentioned that they do groupons frequently, and that I should look into it for next time.  Very friendly, and I appreciate the suggestion that I save myself some money.

After my first review I tried the bronx panini.  Unfortunately, that sandwich had some pretty generic Vons coleslaw on it.  I wasn't impressed.  I'll stick with the bandido.

I still say this place is overpriced, but it is more filling than what it appears."}
{"text":"I had driven by this spot many times and after the advice of my mother I needed to eat less red meat... I knew this would be the fix. I looked over the menu and went with the Adobe Panini  - Roasted turkey, fresh mozzarella, green peppers, corn relish and chipotle mayo... Plus a small bowl of the Corn & Green Chile Bisque I am a huge fan of corn it was a must try... I rate the experience as followed.

Adobe Panini - B+
Corn Green Chile Bisque - A
The Pickle - A+
Staff - A

I had seen some bad reviews not sure why... I really enjoyed my lunch I ate three extra pickles I am a huge pickle fan they were really good. I will be back for sure to enjoy another great meal ."}
{"text":"I used to go to Spicy Pickle on Eastern and St.Rose. My favorites were Red Rock Seafood soup and whole wheat bread and spinach salad. Spinach was always fresh and dressing was tasty and not greasy. 
 
Now
1) I came two last times - no Red Rock soup.
2) And no more that nice real whole wheat bread. They have changed the recipe for some sweet and soft substitution, totally uneatable. 

I'm giving 4 stars for all good memories I have and I hope next time I come they will have red rock seafood soup and BREAD!"}
{"text":"Food is ok but it's a little pricey for wraps/sandwiches. It also takes awhile for your food to come out, so if you're in a hurry or on lunch break this is not the place."}
{"text":"This is the worst service ever i have been waiting  45 mins for a jalf of sandwich and salad but the food was good"}
{"text":"Spicy Pickle is easy and cheap (sandwiches are currently only $5 after 5 p.m.).

 A few things bug me about this place though:
- They close early. 8 p.m.? Really? 
- If you go after the lunch rush they will be out of the soups you desperately want and need.
- If you go after the lunch rush on Mondays they will be out of free cookies they promise with any sandwich.

Good things:
- Pickles are yummy.
- The basil mayo is yummy.
- The kiddos who work there are very nice.

MEH things:
- The sandwiches are ok. Not amazing. Ok. Still better than Subway, Quiznos, etc.
- BF thought the panini crust was too hard.

I will try it again. It is a nice departure from the usual fast food."}
{"text":"I went back and it was much better. The woman just made me the completely wrong thing last time.  This time the sandwich was good just what I wanted. My only issues are I hate the bread. The texture is too cake like not what I want on a roll and the pasta salad I hate. The Cole slaw is the better choice."}
{"text":"I like to order for pick up, it's faster! I love their bandido panini!! Not too spicy and I love turkey with sundried tomatoes!"}
{"text":"Pretty good lunch spot. Their signature spicy tuna salad is a healthy choice but wonder why it's not spicy at all. It comes with a tasteless oil that doesn't do anything for the salad. Definitely get a soup or sandwich to go along with it or you'll be hungry. They also offer flat bread like pizzas, sandwiches, paninis and soups. I like the seafood bisque which I found out recently was only offered at their Las Vegas locations. They also have the sweet green tea I like :)
Great alternative to fast food lunch trap."}
{"text":"have eaten here several times, sandwichs are good, salads are good, the pizza thingies are great, service is prompt and friendly, overall experience was very good. one of our regular stops"}
{"text":"I'm going to give an \"okay\" rating to Spicy Pickle. I would like to give a 4 star rating, but there is one thing holding me back - the price. I realize the food is very fresh and the sandwiches are quite different from other sandwich chains, but still... I think their pricing may be due to the fact they also make the personal pizzas, and they do paninis as well. I can imagine that's kind of costly to a place that is this small. 

I have had Spicy Pickle before I went to this new one in Vegas which is located off of Warm Springs. They opened a Spicy Pickle in Reno when I lived there many moons ago. I remember going a few times and thinking it was pretty good.

On my visit I had the Santa Cruz sandwich ($7.95). And all sandwiches come with a selection of a side: fruit or macaroni salad, or you can upgrade to an actual salad as well, but its costs extra. I opted for the macaroni salad, because I've had it in the past and it is actually very good. It never comes out slimy or gross, but is actually light and tasty, considering it's macaroni. My Santa Cruz was very well put together. The lettuce was crisp, the bread had a nice feel to it, and the other toppings/meat were plentiful, yet not over-bearing. I hate it when I get a sandwich that is busting at the seams, just not my thing. My meal also came with spicy pickle (how appropriate...)

Comparable to... Capprioti's in my opinion, but SP has a lot more selection. The prices are comparable, but SP has a completely different vision from Cap's. You might also compare it to Quizno's, but then again SP is much higher-ranking than Quiznos taste-wise and freshness wise. 

There's a lot of selection here. That's their strong point. If you're looking for something different that you've never had before in the sandwich world, SP would be for you. 

Spicy Pickle, if you were priced just a *bit* lower I would frequent more often."}
{"text":"***Checkin and they give you a small drink and chips for free! ***

Small place that is clean and comfortable.  
I ordered the half chicken salad sandwich and seafood bisque. 
The sandwich was ok.  The chicken salad seemed like it was missing something, but still had a nice crunch. The wheat roll was just ok.  I can't figure out if it was stale or what I disliked about it, but I ended up just eating the chicken salad out of it. 
Now the bisque was amazing!  I ate every drop. 
I also enjoyed the spicy pickle. 
This place was ok, but since it is not super close, I probably would not drive outta my way to return."}
{"text":"I guess when you call in an order for pickup, the quality is not the same as eating there.

We ordered from this location on Thursday 8/14/14 and the sandwiches were pretty good as well as the sides, cole slaw & potato salad.

Today Friday 8/15/14 we decided to order from here again, pickup as well and this time the sides were VERY disappointing.  We got two cole slaws and the containers they put the to go stuff in is not very big to begin with, but one container was only about half full and the other one was even less then half only about a quarter.  REALLY???  

They charge a fairly decent price but when paying $6 to $8, you expect to receive the value for the money paid. 

Consistency is NOT something this place has.  We ordered two Piadina's both exactly the same and one had more substance to it then then other.  One had two pretty good halves, the other only had one full half and one which was half bread with a little substance. Again not a good value for the price being paid.  Both halves should have been equal and the sides cups should be full.  I guess the food is not being checked by anyone before it is given out, it is just made by whomever is in the kitchen that day and given out with no quality control checking.

Not sure if we will give this place a third try on calling in an order for pickup.  I think face to face inside so you can discuss this with the manager is a better chance of getting equal quality for equal cost."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE spicy pickle! Sandwiches are great (always make sure to get them HOT!) Pickles are awesome too! 

Food is consistent and really good. Good variety, and you can easily make your own sandwich with a ton of choices. Good breads, meats, cheeses, toppings, sauces. Overall a really good sandwich!"}
{"text":"I always drive past here wondering if its good. So i yelped it. Great reviews, but i still kept driving past. So today I finally decided to bite the bullet and damm was it good.

I ordered the adobe panini! It was good. There is so many choices. I was confused. Next time I'm gonna build my own.

I have to visit again soon. Maybe monday. They gave me a coupon for buy one get one pizzeti and i wanna try it."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Like the half sandwich half salad combo. Greek salad is fresh, love their new cuban sandwich. Pickle is spicy, service is great. Normally only eat there for lunch."}
{"text":"I recently got another to-go order.  The sandwich was once again delicious, with high quality fresh ingredients, and they did include a spicy pickle this time!  I like the extra kick the spiciness of the pickle provides.  Bumped up a star as a result."}
{"text":"I'm another one of those \"I went to Spicy Pickle because I bought the Groupon\" people. I've been reading not so great things about the place, so my expectation bar was set fairly low. That worked well because I was not disappointed by the food. I was not blown away either.

I went with the half sandwich + soup combo. I let one of my friends use up the remainder of my Groupon. On a recommendation from another friend, I chose the Yard Bird and paired it up with the Seafood Bisque. I quite enjoyed the bisque. It wasn't too salty and was pretty flavorful. The sandwich was decent. It started off slightly blah, but then half way through, I reached the section that had all of the cubes of apple and the piece of bacon. That part of the sandwich was delicious and ended the meal on a high note. As for the pickle, it wasn't in-your-face spicy, but I consider that a good thing.

Overall, I give Spicy Pickle an A-OK. The food was good enough that I wouldn't mind returning for another lunch with friends."}
{"text":"We each ordered a  1/2 Bastille Panini (portabella mushroom, roasted red peppers, provolone, red onions, tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts and sundried tomato mayo) plus a cup of Redrock seafood bisque.  I would return for the bisque, but the MSRP of the Panini seemed high."}
{"text":"Food was bland and cold. Flavors didn't go well together. Way over priced for the quality of food.  If you're thinking about trying it, go to panera bread instead."}
{"text":"I like the food.  It's quick, they have good salad and half sandwich options.  When I am out running errands this is a nice go-to place to swing into to grab a quick bite to-go without having to eat heavy fried food.   Have I had better, yes.  Does it matter, not really.  I don't have to wait in a long line (hello Panera) and that makes me happy."}
{"text":"Came here two Sundays ago with my hubs, brother and brother's girlfriend. 

Cashier was nice/service was fine (no complaints) but my brother's girlfriend and I both ordered the spinach salad and neither one of us liked it. The biggest issue was that the dressing had NO flavor. If it weren't for the blue cheese (which I don't normally like or eat but NEEDED to with this salad) it would have been terrible. There would have been no flavor. 

My brother really likes this place however and eats here fairly frequently for lunch during the work week. He's had plenty of sandwiches/wraps that he likes. My husband and I aren't from the area so I can't personally comment on their other menu items but I would steer clear of the spinach salad."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. Both because I had a Groupon. The first time I came I got a sandwich, which was good, but not great. There was some thing in it that I didn't like. I couldn't figure it out. But the people were very helpful.

I came back today to use my second Groupon and ordered the Napa w/out bacon. I was so happy when my order came out and the man asked and checked my pizza to make sure there was no bacon. Not too long ago I was at a different sandwich place in the district, ordered no bacon and they put bacon in it. So I really appreciated that. When I went back to work, my supervisor and I tried the pizza. It was really good. I'm not usually a fan of flat bread pizza, but this was really good. There was chicken, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella and spicy ranch sauce. The sauce was not at all spicy to me, but we really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Damn. I thought I had reviewed SP already.  Could be that it's 6 am on a sunday and I haven't gone to sleep yet.  Kids, gotta love em'. Or put them up for adoption.  

Where to begin, where to begin...

First:   Name -   SPICY PICKLE -  A W E S O M E  S A U C E.

All you ass hats that don't like the name, don't fucking eat here.  Hey, I'm not a pickle fan either, but that doesn't stop me deep throating their sammiches. (insert gay joke here).  They could'a called the place \"Red Hot Fermented Cucumber\".  Yeah, that's nice...

FYI,  They also have a table that resembles a pickle;  not just shaped like pickle, but RESEMBLES a god damn, translucent green Mother effin' pickle. Gigity.    

Second:    Food    -    The first time I ate here, I had a turkey samich with some corn on it and some mildly spicey salsa.  It didn't create the euphoric mexican high I had hoped for, but I remember thinking \"damn that is one freshly made sammy\"  Fresh...  F - R - E - S - H.   No, none of that \"Subway, eat fresh\" crapola, I mean fresh like they may have a veggie garden in the back and or a little chicken coop on the roof.  The bad larry did manage to give my tummy a workout later, if you catch my drift, but I'd still eat here again (and again (and again)), it's not like it was Chipotle's carnitas burrito...

I've also thad the pleasure of masticating their italian sammy;  chalk full o' meaty, cheesy goodness.   mmmmm, meat and cheese, on warm, grilled bread.. Wait, didn't I I read someone elses SP review about the bread being too hard to chew? WTF is that about?  I here-by offer my services as  \"step in chewer\" to any sally who can't handle the SP's pannini bread.   

Conclusion:  - This place is bitchen.  The service has always been excellent, and the food has consistently been the same, delish,satisfying fair that keeps a fat, white mo-fo like me comming back for more, and the restaurant itself is a pleasure to eat in.   

STEEEEEEEVE."}
{"text":"Friendly setting and a fun name.  Very confortablr, music was a touch loud but seriously only very very slightly loud so not a big deal.
Own space with some booth seating, nice service with friendly staff brining out the modern plate to your table.
I had the Paran salad- tasteful and crisp salad with fresh tasting avocado.  The Lemon olive oil vinegarette could have been slightly more lemon and vinegar but was still good.
Cheddar broccoli soup was also very good.
My wife had the Roman panini- cheese was sweet and tomatoes were a nice ripeness.  
All in all a great sandwich shop- and being about 100 yards from a corporate big name shop (starts with an S) my choice is very easy and clear- Spicy Pickle hands down every time!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was sorely disappointed with the food here because I used to frequent Spicy Pickle all the time when there was a location on St. Rose and Eastern.  I always get the Lobster Bisque and the Bandito Panini, which I got again on this day for lunch.  The soup was lukewarm and my sandwich was flavorless.  Needless to say, there are way too many other sandwich places for me to return. :("}
{"text":"Mediocre food served very slowly.  30 minutes for a salad when you're only at 20% of capacity?  For a place that \"caters\" to the people in the nearby corporate park?"}
{"text":"I go to Spicy pickle alot considering it's right next door to my job. Lately, the service is getting slower, portions smaller, and price higher.  Today I got a club pannini, and broccoli cheddar soup.  It took 20 minutes and my entire party got their food first, and two other to go orders and two other dine in patrons who oredered after me.  I paid 12.19 for my combo which turns out she charged for a whole sandwich and a soup not the lunch combo. Soup I paid 4 bucks for is a tiny portion and tastes terrible; like campbells cream of chicken with frozen broccoli bits. No cheddar. Sandwich is fine. When I asked the manager about the soup he tells me, yeah I know soup is expensive to make.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's not bad and it's not greeeeat... but it's a pretty OK choice for lunch if you work around the area.

The place has soups, wraps, sandwiches and panini's and a nice variety of choices of each.  Their pasta salad and potato salad is pretty bleh.  I usually get a Panini or flatbread, and I would rate them mediocre.  Their food is not jam packed with flavor.  Good thing they include a pickle with their meals, that's normally my favorite part!

The thing I really do like about the place is the relaxed atmosphere.  Its clean and cool and they bring the food straight to your table.  I find it a nice a quiet getaway for my lunch hour.
Don't forget to check in for chips and a drink - it makes lunch a sweeter deal!"}
{"text":"Jumping on the \"been here cause I had a Groupon\" wagon :)  

Finally got to try this place out since we were in the area.  Atmosphere is real nice.  Clean and I liked the colors inside.  I was actually expecting much less for the inside of this place.  The workers were real  nice and service was quick.

I got the Bandido panini - mostly because I liked the name of the sandwich and couldn't decide what else to get.  It was pretty good!  Lots of turkey, nicely toasted with that little crunch.  Loved the roasted red peppers and sundried tomatoes in it and pepper jack cheese gives its a kick!  For an dollar extra, I got some pasta salad on the side.  I thought that was sort of bland and could use some extra flavor.  Nothing really too fancy there!

My husband got the Wise Guy because he has a love for Italian sandwiches.  It was pretty mediocre.  \"Better than a Subway sandwich\" was what I thought when i bit into it.  There was way too much bread so the meat got a little lost (insert \"thats what she said\" here).  I did appreciate that they included quality Italian meats like capicola in it... but the entire time he was wishing that he got a panini instead :)

This place is a solid three.  If I'm ever in the area again, I would probably try it again."}
{"text":"My fiance and I tried Spicy Pickle for lunch today.  I had the corn and green chili bisque, as well as a wrap with turkey, honey mustard, spinach, and apples (!) inside.  The wrap sounded interesting on paper, and I thought it might be one of those kind of happy surprises where a bunch of random ingredients work together.  It wasn't.  The honey mustard clashed with the apples and had a weird aftertaste.  The soup was bland and cold.  My fiance got a panini with roasted red peppers on it, which was over-toasted and bland.  The food took a long time to come out, and the service was just so-so.  I wasn't thoroughly sicked out by this place - it was partially my fault for trying something so risky - but I'm still not very motivated to return."}
{"text":"Definitely just an average sandwich joint.  One thing I didn't understand is why they didn't have soup.  They have the typical pick 2 combo you might find at Panera or Cafe Zupas, except you are picking between a sandwich, panini, and flat bread pizza....so essentially you are getting 1/2 sandwich 1/2 sandwich.

The side of potato salad was very generic and heavy on the mustard.  I got the tuna salad sandwich which was just ok.  It is adequate if you are in the area and need a quick bite that won't cost you 1,000 calories, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"I really like the Spicy Pickle! Although the pickle that comes with your meal isn't THAT spicy! :P
My friend and I hit this up after an intense yoga class, and even after being starved all day then taking yoga class we still couldn't finnish our half sandwich with a soup combo! The seafood bisque is yummy so is the Chili.
I hope this place sticks around. The service was kind and fast. No complaints there either. Great place to stop for your lunch hour!"}
{"text":"A make your own sandwich place with a hefty list of options. I was lazy and picked the Italian panini (but changed out the mayo for balsalmic vinegar) and the fiance created his own concoction. They let you pick up to 3 meats for the same price which is pretty sweet if you love variety (you get 3 oz of meat on each sandwich regardless of whether you pick 1, 2, or 3 meats). 

I was happy with my panini , but my fiance's came out semi crispy on top but with cold meat and cheese in the middle. He blames the grill being turned up too high, but I have no clue. Sounds nit-picky, but for a $7 panini you want it to be right ! The pizetti's looked freaking awesome, so I look forward to trying one next time.  Also of note - no baked chips options (they really should have some!), and this place is crazy kid friendly. I'm talking there were 15 patrons under the age of 3 while we were dining on a Saturday. I definitely know to avoid this place on Tuesday evenings - kids eat free!"}
{"text":"Was drawn in by the name/sign...it was good.  I had the Sicilian pizzeti, but had to ask for a spicy pickle on the side (they should just offer it).  The pickle was great - I don't know why they don't sell them by the jar at the counter - they would make $$$.  The wait for the pizzetti was longer than I thought it would be, but great thin crust - overall very good lunch choice.

Nice place, pleasant, small HD TV with some sports on; clean and a nice patio as well.

I'll go back to try salads, etc. for sure.  Defnitiely need to get more of those pickles - they are great!"}
{"text":"Good quality food, some unique choices, great pickels and the cookies are awesome.

Not a great value, they are quite expensive and the sides - extremely small."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and had the same experience both times. I ordered two different thing and the people I was with were generous enough to let me try their food. 

Service is fine. Nothing extraordinary. 

The food isn't good. I have seen almost every sandwich offered on the menu and the bread is huge and the meat is disappearing! The meat is not good. It tastes like the cheap kind you get in the refrigerated section pre-sliced. You own a restaurant the least you could do is slice your own!  The cheese is flavorless. I'm not sure they could slice the tomato any thinner. Nothing about any sandwich is good or worth going back for. I also had a flat pizza. Not good. It was dry and flavorless! I found myself wanting some red pepper just to have some flavor. I won't go back here unless there is nothing else. It isn't good."}
{"text":"Spicy Pickle is a nice quiet place to grab a quick lunch. For the most part, I consider them to be like Panera or any of the other bistro like sandwich eateries on a fast food scale. I came here with my friend on her lunch break and was out with an ample amount of time left. 

The counter service was pleasant and our food came out quickly. The meal itself was filling, but was not too much to make us sluggish. My Wise Guy came with capicola, mortadella, hard salami, provolone cheese, EVOO basil mayo, roasted red peppers, pepperoncini peppers, red onions, lettuce and tomato served on Ciabatta. The bread was thick and chewy without being tough. I like that they do not slather the sandwich in mayo either. I was debating on leaving it out, but was worried it would be too dry. My decision to let it be did not end with regrets and I am grateful for it. Add a dollar for a side salad and it becomes a nice meal. I am not a fan of their vinaigrette. It is more oil based and had no flavor. Next time I will request something else. 

Overall, I would come back again. It is just hard to not go a little further up the street to my favorite brunch place."}
{"text":"was recommended this place from a co-worker.  I could not eat the chicken wrap, it was disgusting.  there were lots of pieces of fat and i just couldn't eat it and had to throw it away.  Don't like putting bad reviews, but don't like buying lunch and having to throw it away either."}
{"text":"Can we talk about the customer service?! Mmmm, this place is where it is at. Fresh ingredients, tasty sandwiches and appetizing wraps. 

I got the wise guy sandwich with macaroni salad and their infamous spicy pickle. To my surprise the spicy pickle itself was delicious, crunchy with a kick at the end and the salad was to die for! The ingredients inside of the wise guy were good but the bread was tough and scratched the roof of my mouth. It made it difficult to enjoy the sandwich but I couldn't complain after receiving a filling amount of food for only $8.50 which is a good buy of you're not looking to add on any extras. I still prefer Jimmy Johns or Port of Subs though."}
{"text":"Hell. Yes.

If you're not adventurous you can build your own sandwich from any of the fixins they've got, but there's good food to be had in their menu. All kinds of delicious gourmet sandwiches. Great bread, unique condiments, and a signature spicy pickle. (Which is both spicy and a damn good pickle.)

The service is consistently friendly and reasonably fast. A little slower than a Subway or its ilk, but the sandwiches are made with love, are more complex, and panini(s?) of course require time on the panini press.

Also: THE COOKIES. Huge, soft cookies with a beautiful crumb. Nom nom.

The only downer--and the missing star--has been the gradual reduction in meat content. Multi-meat sandwiches are still looking tasty, but the single-meat jobs are starting to look a little thin."}
{"text":"Ok for a sandwich place. I'd go back, but I wouldn't say I'd ever crave this place. Good enough for a sandwich. It got mad busy around 1215 & they were a little slow cranking out the food. They have nutrition facts online which helps if you are trying to eat healthier."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good lunch spot, but nothing spectacularly insane.

There's not much to say except I've been here once, had a really great chicken caesar.  My husband liked the pepperoni pizza.  It's nice to get a small lunch pizza from a place like this instead of getting a whole pie, although BJ's is just down the street which is a little better.  However this one seemed healthier.  Also, they have great fresh brewed iced tea.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here but it is so close to my house that it is worth going to."}
{"text":"Went here with one of my sisters yesterday, her treat. We went in around 4ish and the girl behind the counter was on the phone. She didn't even acknowledge us. She just stood there talking for a good 5-7 minutes then said, \"Oh, sorry. Can I take your order.\" Ugh. I think she was talking to another customer on the phone, but somebody else should have ran POS at that point.

 I got the Spinach Salad (large - $6.29) and my sister got the El Rancho Salad (Large - $6.99) We each got a fountain drink because I saw they have a soda water tab, which is always cheaper than Pelligrino. 

I'm not sure what a small looks like, but I can't imagine it would be any large than a cup. The large salad is not filling whatsoever, which is why I suspect it's served with a sourdough roll. My salad was topped with blue cheese and apples and some sort of vinagrette. Sadly, it was very bland, because there wasn't much cheese and the dressing tasted like straight canola. My sister said her salad was okay, but that it was too small, especially for the $18 she spent for our meal. 

I found it odd that most of the lights were turned off, so it was pretty dark inside. I can understand if they keep most of the lights off when no customers are in there, but when there's 3 to 4 tables filled, the lights should all be on. It made it feel cold, especially because it was already getting darker outside. 

I'd like to try their harvest special, but I'm not going out of my way to go eat there. Their prices are too steep for what you receive. So yeah, meh, I've experienced better. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Spicy Pickle is a semi-regular lunch stop for me.  It's close to the office, and until last week, I could snag covered parking.  No more, now all the formerly open spots are \"reserved\".  Drat.  I've only had one thing here, the \"Classico Pizzetti\", which is a complicated way of saying \"pepperoni pizza\".  It's very thin and very fresh, and suits my appetite just right.  The crust is great and there's something about the seasoning in the sauce that hits the spot for me.  Someday I'll get adventurous and order something else from the menu."}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars for being clean, having a friendly cashier/expeditor, and the eponymous \"spicy pickle\" being very tasty.

Other than that, it needs some serious work especially if it wants to compete for lunch business from the nearby business parks. I decided to check the place out for lunch recently and ordered the chicken Caesar salad in a spinach wrap to-go at 12:45pm - simple, easy, quick. There were about 10 people in front of me waiting for their orders if you include both the line and the people waiting for food, with a smattering of guests seated at the tables enjoying lunch. So, I was slightly shocked when I looked down at my watch and noted that 15 minutes had passed since I had ordered - and still no wrap. All told it took 18 minutes from payment to sandwich in hand, a near travesty for those of us who need to get back to work at lunchtime.  There were two cooks in the kitchen and they maybe turned out a combined 12 orders in the 18 minutes I was there. This is a counter-service lunch place, the kitchen should not be crawling along at a glacial pace while the manager pokes away at the POS with a clipboard (partially ignoring some customers waiting to order by the way).

As for the Chicken Caesar Wrap, well it was not like any other Caesar that I have ever had! First off, they used feta instead of Parmesan (even though the menu says Parmesan) - a completely different flavor and texture that was off-putting. Next, I had hoped for a homemade Caesar dressing but whatever dressing they used tasted closer to soy sauce than to Caesar. I would have settled for something out of a squeeze bottle. Finally, the chicken was \"meh\" - your average quick service sandwich strips so nothing redeemable there. Trying to hard to \"spice\" up what should be a straight-forward sandwich left it unrecognizable as what was advertised.

Overall, this outlet needs to up their game. Its in a competitive lunch area surrounded by business parks and should be able to make a killing. However, if the kitchen can't keep up, the management is checked out, and the food is mediocre then its going to have a hard time. Normally, I like to give places at least 2 chances, but I honestly don't think that I have the time! If it took almost 20 minutes to get a cold wrap when it was not busy, I definitely couldn't fit it in my lunch break if the place was slammed!"}
{"text":"Came here just at random! I wasn't a big fan of anything.. The atmosphere or the food.. I got the 3 cheese sandwich and it was lacking some flavor.. My boyfriend got some limited edition buffalo sandwich which also wasn't all it was made out to be.. We also were limited on what could be ordered since they were out of certain soups and don't serve breakfast paninis after a certain time. Basically it's a downgraded version of zupas but pricier! Not an expensive place- but for what we paid we could've have a better meal, more options and a side of bread and chocolate covered strawberry .."}
{"text":"Well I got a coupon I'm the mail 2 sandwiches for $10.  They didn't honor that so the tone was set.  Now if the sandwiches were fantastic no big deal.  Unfortunately they were marginal at best   I can safely cross the spicy pickle off of my list at this point.  if you want a good sandwich at a similar price go to Panera bread. Beats this place hands down."}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop in Vegas!  Seriously my favorite place to get a sandwich.  The cole slaw and sundried tomato mayo are awesome.  I always order a \"build your own\" panini style (hot) on their ciabatta bread, delicious!  I also love their pickles, so much so that I order a side of them every time and they are indeed spicy.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love there thin crust pizza... They would win me more if they advertised good albacore tuna. The one they use is disgusting"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and use their catering services for work. The food is always great and the service is exceptional. I love the yard-bird and the macaroni salad is the best.."}
{"text":"I made the worst mistake coming here for the first time one day during lunch time at work. I happened to run into it while looking for a 7-11 which happens to be next door. I tried it and decided on the Bandido Panini because the ingredients sounded yummy. The menu stated peppered turkey, pepperjack, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, and chipotle mayo.Ok well that sounds good right? I was totally wrong because this panini that I ordered to go was a huge disappointment in a bag just waiting to explode in my face! They state the Panini is built on Fresh Baked Rosemary Focaccia. Well I don't know about that because it taste like flavorless cardboard. This crap was not cheap either, the combo which is a small Panini, small side and soda set me back like $11 and some change.

I am sad to report this is a 1 star trash dump of a rating. I wasted my taste buds and money on a bad decision. I learned my lesson.

The photo I took you can see is prior to taking a bite. This bland and flavorless Panini should have been posed in the casket it belongs down in trash land."}
{"text":"Had the Southside Sandwich with a caesar salad - to go.  I thought they were both good.  The sandwich had a good portion of me and lot's of flavor.  I would definitely eat from here again."}
{"text":"Service was very attentive and nice. Their build your own pizza did not have a list of items to choose from so it was difficult to order. Pizza came out nice, not as crispy as I had hoped but very tasty."}
{"text":"Spicy Pickle is very conveniently located across the street from my work.... so I have found myself here a few times when I am in a lunch rush!

The food is good, although I find it to be a lil over priced for what you get.  I usually order a wrap of some sort, whether it is on their menu or a create my own selection. 

There is plenty of seating inside, they also offer outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"It's pretty bad when you come to a sandwich place called the spicy pickle, get a sandwich, a pickle, and potato salad on your plate, and the potato salad (which tasted like it came from a grocery store) was the best thing on the plate. It is fast and clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Bandido panini & green chili corn chowder were delicious!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop was not what I was expecting. Although it was a quality sandwich with a great taste, the price was too much. The portions were so small for a sandwich so expensive. The great taste is overruled by the ridiculous price of a sandwich."}
{"text":"My fella purchased the Groupon for this place, so off we went. 

I wanted to like Spicy Pickle, but I was really unimpressed. I ordered the half panini and soup combo. For my panini I got the Bastille and Red Rock Seafood chowder for the soup. The soup was just ok, a little on the sweet side which was a tad unappealing. The panini was absolutely flavorless. Really disappointing. My fella got the Sausalito Bandido panini and he was very disappointed as well. The vegetables were not fresh and everything in my sandwich was soggy. I only had a few bites of my sandwich before I gave up entirely and threw it away. 

After dinner, my fella recommended we get a palate cleanser (aka dessert) to get the lackluster flavors off our tongues.

I have no incentive to come back here."}
{"text":"For the price you can' beat the panini's and the soup that they have.  I just wish they were open later on the weekends so I could satisfy my craving more often."}
