{"text":"I would have never even thought of going here until my dad brought me for brunch one Sunday. There was no lineup (it wasn't even buy inside), and the food was served quickly. The staff was quite friendly and attentive. My dad ordered his favourite - the red velvet pancakes, and I opted for the huevos rancheros corn tortilla gluten-free option. The food was very tasty, fresh, and healthy. Nothing was greasy.

I love restaurants that clearly point out food allergies, just to make it easier for us."}
{"text":"First time there. Pretty nice interior, cool mirrors in the washrooms. Okay food not good not bad and some dishes are definitely better than others. Generally overpriced for what you get.  
Nice patio but the prices (especially beer) will keep the people away which is too bad.  
Not gonna lie, I will probably give it another try."}
{"text":"We came for Sunday brunch after reading about Tilted Grill's 'Red Velvet Pancakes'. They were incredible and the Fairfax High was great too!  Def. worth a visit."}
{"text":"Above average casual fare, like burgers, and alternatives like quinoa salad. Great thick fries, and a nice patio in the afternoon sun, good evening vibe too.  Wide selection of premium liquors, all listed on the menu so you don't have to stare awkwardly at the back of the bar, pretending you can read all the labels."}
{"text":"Recently went here for brunch with a rather large group of people.  It was great that they could accommodate the large reservation and the staff seemed to handle our group pretty well.  There were a couple of errors with food (forgetting bacon & sausage for example), but nothing too major to throw off the mood of the group.

Apparently the famous dish here is the red velvet pancakes, which I only got to taste a bite of due to being gluten intolerant.  The small bite I had was pretty tasty and they are well presented - those who got the pancakes really seemed to enjoy them - like having candy for breakfast!

I ordered the regular breakfast with no toast and it was sufficient enough to fill me.  When I first looked at their menu I thought they had gluten free options, but actually all they do is highlight that your meal is gluten free if you don't get toast or the tortilla in the breakfast tortilla.  Thanks for the head's up I guess.  Good to know I'll pay the same for less food then other people.  If you love your caffeine, the coffee does flow pretty freely and they fill up the cup lots.  I got the urge and enjoyed a mimosa with my meal which was very nice.  A couple other people got Caesars and they spoke highly of them.

Overall a good enough experience.  I hope to stop by again, possibly later in the day to try out more of their drink options."}
{"text":"If you went inside this space when it was BLVD, you'll still recognize the layout but little else. What was once a darker room is now lightened up quite a bit. I'll be interested to see what the patio looks like when it is done. 

We went on a Tuesday at lunch and were one of only 5-6 tables. The server was very friendly but she put my client off when she (client) asked \"Do you know if there is vinegar in the Asian dressing?\" to which the server answered \"I don't know\". That really should have been followed by \"but I'll go find out\". Otherwise though, she was very good. 

I had the short-rib burger. It was good, not over the top, but good. What was FANTASTIC were the fries. They may well be in my top 3 favourite fries in Calgary. My dining companion had the turkey burger which she said was good but nothing too special. 

I'd probably go back -  there are a few other things on the menu I'd like to try.  I hope that they'll make a go of it at Tilted Grill. I've certainly been hearing great things about brunch."}
{"text":"Shared a $32 steak dinner with my husband late one evening. It came with yam fries and \"seasonal vegetables\". Everything was oversalted and the yam fries tasted like tempura... not a fan. It's a shame that the steak was oversalted because it was cooked perfectly and it was nice and soft. Oh, and our crantinis were watered down. Nice ambience... oversalty, overpriced food. Everything on the plate tasted the same. Also, the \"seasonal vegetables\" portion was pretty sad.... had a hard time finding them amongst the huge pile of yam fries."}
{"text":"mmmmm Tilted Grill is quite the delicious meat and cheese-filled experience. I believe I may be full for days ...

This restaurant mixes an inviting decor with Asian/Mexican inspired street food (there's a sentence I never thought I'd say).

Everything on the menu is filled with kitsch, and in a totally good way. There are little baked, hand-glazed candied-banana-filled donuts inspired by a roadside dessert truck in Korea; a Mexican Mole Chicken that's as a take on \"Mexico's National Food\";  a Mac & Bacon & Cheese that will make you wish the calories didn't count; a smoked Salmon Vodka Caesar (seriously) and a fun kids menu with a grilled cheese proudly advertised as sans crust.

Stuff comes on a stick, in a little pot and in otherwise bit-sized handfuls that are fun and easy to eat and enjoy like the street food that inspired it. 

Veggies beware, there isn't a lot on this menu if you live in the vegetarian or vegan house (but maybe come for a glass of Red Velvet wine?). Also, they do not take debit (although there is a machine) so bring cash or credit only please.

The menu is anything if not interesting and if you like cheese, meat, and spice, give the Tilted Grill a try.

{"text":"I booked a rather large brunch there for a Sunday back in January.   We booked for 25 to 30 and ended up with about 22 people showing up.  Considering the size of group I was very impressed with the service.  It was prompt.  The food came quickly and tasted delicious!  I had the red velvet pancakes!  That's what attracted me to the place.  I loved them... loved them!  I know some that were with us stated that they were on the sweet side, but that's how I love my pancakes!  These were red velvet pancakes(tasting similar to the cake) with a cream cheese icing and candied pecans.  Pure maple syrup came on the side, but I did not need to use a drop of it as the pancakes were perfect as were.  So good!  I will definitely go back and maybe even take the kids as they had children's portions.  

The seating are was great.  We were able to socialize amongst two large groups of us.  I enjoyed the entire setting."}
{"text":"There a few things that I really like about breakfast.

#1 That it is served after noon
#2 It's delicious
#3 It's a great price

Tilted grill has hit all three and to add a bonus to my list, FANTASTIC SERVICE and a FANTASTIC PATIO!

The day I was there they had a great special. A Mexican style scramble wrap with bacon, cheese and homemade pi-co de gallo. Served with hash browns and toast. All for $10.

This left me with enough money to split an order of Red Velvet Pancakes!
OMG!! There is a reason that Tilted Grill was the first place winner in the 'Mission Pancake Showdown'

These pancakes are like eating the most delicious cupcake. Even Crave doesn't do it this well!

The pancakes are red velvet topped with icing, cream cheese dollops, in house candied pecans, and lightly dusted with powdered sugar. Of course a side of syrup completes the look.
3 stacked pancakes, all for $7... ridiculous!

I finished off my meal with a mimosa. Fresh squeezed OJ with a splash of bubbled. Unbelievable!

So my verdict... 5 stars based on the pancakes alone. If you don't try these you are totally missing out."}
{"text":"Oh @TiltedGrill, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this place definitely met my extremely low expectations. I have heard nothing but less than great things about this place and decided to give it a try on Sunday with a bunch of twitter pals.

Word of note to the entire restaurant industry: When 10 people from twitter make a reservation, treat us properly because you can guarantee all 10 of us will tell the world how our experience went!!

I didn't order any food, so I can't comment on that, all I can say is the service s.u.c.k.e.d!!!
We were the only table inside for Sunday brunch, so I can understand the server is busy... NOT. She was totally MIA. 

First of all, she forgot my coffee, only brought 9, then she forgot my water, then I had to ask twice for a refill. And since I was only there for the coffee, why wouldn't she pay attention and fill me up?! I don't mind a few mistakes here and there, but at least be present so I can grab your attention and ask for a coffee or water. She was just MIA. Completely nowhere in sight. 

Second, my girlfriend has some diet restrictions, which actually aren't that tough to accommodate, and they literally just said \"we can't get you anything\", so my one buddy didn't eat. They didn't even bother asking her what she COULD have to see if they could help her out. 

Third, one of our friends showed up late, after we'd all ordered food. The server did not come around for another 20 minutes until our food arrived at the table, and just then gave our new guest a menu/drink to look at. She never came back to take her order until we were done eating. So needless to say, she didn't bother ordering any food since we'd all finished our meals. 

Unfortunately, groups of 8 or more get the auto gratuity on the bill, so we had no choice but to tip decent, but I can assure you it wasn't worth my money and I won't be back to try the food.

Sorry Tilted Grill, you failed!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. In some ways I do, it all depends on the day and time, but the many downsides really ruin it for this business. 

Initially, Tilted Grill dared to be different, playing a little more estoeric music, and trying to inject a bit of sophistication into 4th st, having interesting things playing on their TV screens, snowboarding, skiing, and other moving wallpaper. 

Alas, they changed. Wether it is a reflection of the typical bar goer, or a reflection of management having no idea what they are and what they stand for, Tilted Grill reverted back to the previous business model of the former tenants, 'BLVD.' Which, ends up being another 'me-too' bar catering to the lowest common denominator of pounding top 40 'music', 'DJ's' eye watering beer prices, and trendy young clients wearing fast clothes spending their fast money before it burns a hole in their pocket.

Melrose, in miniature, you could say.

Going from the odd posey car dotted around the place on many evenings in warmer times, fast cars too.

As night follows day, the 'BLVD' crowd returned to Tilted Grill as if nothing ever happened. 

If you didn't like BLVD, you won't like Tilted Grill. I have no idea if its the same management, but it's almost as if all they did was change the sign.

TG, has a personality problem. In the day and earlier on in the week, it can be very civilised, not too crazy, not too loud, one can have a cup of coffee or a beer and food with mates or biz pals, and not have to use megaphones or queue to actually get in.

Saying that, on several occasions I have been there with friends unwinding after a day at work, it wasn't dead by any means,  at the point of 10pm, even before it was a Friday, the music was unceremoniously changed from classic stuff, to hip hop, rap, and top 40. Volume knob turned up. Lights dimmed. 

Well, goodbye conversation, hello overspill from Melrose.

Hey can you make it any more obvious?

 Ah. I guess it's time for the folks who have been there already for 2-3hrs spending good money, are persona- non-grata now, as the management is too busy chasing after the money of the jersey shore kids walking by. Talk about feeling as if one has 'outstayed your welcome'.

Why don't you open your windows and blast the thuds outside to tempt them in, and have a muscled gorilla check peoples ids in a queue outside? Yeah, that's original.

Does it work? I'm not sure it always does for them. Sometimes I walk past at 10 or 10:30 pm and they have closed already, sometimes there's folks filling up the beer garden outside. My guess is it will get worse as it summer comes along.

When it does work I guess one can't blame the owners if it fills the place. This place really had potential to do something different. If they were forced to default to 'me-too' because of a lack of customers then that really speaks volumes for the drinking demographic in Calgary.

I will keep going early on in the week, but only now and again, even though it's closer to me, and the staff are really nice, Armadillo bar a block or two south, and Rose and Crown 2mins away north, are way cheaper. 

Paying $8.50 for okay beer is rather steep.

I fear with 'The Tilted Kilt' opening up opposite (come back Bob The Fish, all is forgiven) my immediate local choices will decent into tackiness. If you don't know, Tilted Kilt is a US chain of bars, akin to Hooters with tartan, only the girls serving the beers are showing even more boob, and midriff. 

Sigh. A sexualised, tacky theme bar, with more TV's. Have we really come to this Calgary?

Anyway, the day Tilted Grill starts charging to get in, even though it's my 'local'? That's the day they lose my business forever."}
{"text":"Next time you want to head into Tilted Grill for a drink, head over the wood. There you'll meet Tristan-waiting and ready to make you a cocktail with one of the many alcohols from his might tower of booze in the middle of the bar.

He'll also tell you that the Dojo salad is a pretty darn tasty side to get with your meal. Whatever dressing that sits atop that salad is DELISH! Can I bottle some of that and take it home with me? Now, I'LL tell you that it goes really well with the turkey wrap. Get that too. It's full and saucy and the turkey is cut into nice little squares. How the heck did it come wrapped so neatly? Right to the tasty end, that wrap did not fall apart and my hands only got a little bit covered with sauce right after.

One of these days I really will partake in the patio. It's huge and I love the fireplaces! I'm just a wee bit of a wuss to be sitting out there on a less than hot day, fireplace or no fireplace.

Oh, also... donut satay! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Famoso pizzeria was closed due to a broken water main, so my bf and I decided to check out Tilted Grill on 4th St. 
The outside is still under construction, but a big banner over the entrance told us to come on in, and we did...to a very lavishly decored, completely empty pub. 
They must've dropped a bundle on the design, which was tasteful but now have to gouge the customer with the menu prices. 
The waiter told us they specialize in \"comfort food\" and \"street vendor faves\", like mexican tacos, burgers, etc....Well, I've had mexican tacos, guys, and didn't pay $17 for them!! 
We were tempted to walk out but were hungry so we ordered the Cali burger and short-rib burger. Even though we were the only ones there, it took about 30-45 minutes to serve us. The burgers were big & thick, and yes, the cranberries on the Cali burger were a nice touch, and the apple slaw on the short-rib was tasty, but really, not impressed enough to go back anytime soon. 
Final word: Over-priced street food, with expensive decor"}
{"text":"Eff-ing nomtastic!

Yes that's right, I used two made-up words to get your attention. I came here this past Sunday for Father's Day brunch. I had made reservations the day before, though the restaurant wasn't busy at 11 upon arrival.

We were greeted by a cute and friendly hostess who showed us to our table where my Grandpa had arrived shortly before us. Our server was prompt in arriving to take our drink order. I began with the Chinook Caesar. Smoked salmon infused vodka sounds a little fishy you say? I disagree, it's not fishy at all. The smokiness comes through nicely and doesn't overpower the flavour of the cocktail. I put this caesar in a very close second to the Bakon Vodka caesars we had at the Toronto Open Party. The Chinook Caesar is a must try!

For my meal I went with the red velvet pancakes and a side of sausages. The sausages were your standard breakfast sausages, nothing spectacular there. The pancakes however! If heaven existed, it would be made of these pancakes. I missed the part on the menu that said they came with cream cheese icing as my mind was completely blown when I bit into what I thought was just plain old whipped cream. The candied pecans were a great addition, providing a little crunch to the fluffy, soft cakes. I am ruined for life now as I will have to demand red velvet pancakes wherever I go for brunch and I feel that I will be sadly disappointed to find them missing from the menu at all places.

Our server was great. I didn't catch her name though (she had an Australian accent). She kept the coffee refills coming for those that were drinking it and got all the answers to my dad's \"what's gluten-free on the menu\" question. The only thing she forgot was the ketchup for my brother's potatoes. No biggie.

Upon leaving, the hostess thanked us for coming in and chatted us up quickly to get our thoughts on the meal. Great customer service.

Tilted Grill is a place you need to check out."}
