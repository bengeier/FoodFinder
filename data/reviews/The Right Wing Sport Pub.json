{"text":"Fairly typical sports bar. Food was decent quality though more expensive than it should be. Low rating due to atrocious service during our lunch. Little caring shown, huge wait time for food and they never checked with one of our number if she wanted anything else when her soup choice was not in."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with lots of HD screens, extremely friendly staff and good pub fare. Their wings are really good, but the burgers are better."}
{"text":"Wings very tasty...
Lots of tv's....
Staff look great and are super friendly!!!"}
{"text":"I have come back a few times in past year and this place has just gone downhill.  It will fold soon.  I give this place a 3 instead of 4 because of the terrible service we get from the staff there.  They just seem miserable.  The wings are one of my favorites.    Love the option of wing sizes as I like them smaller."}
{"text":"Used to love that place until the bartender got her 3rd and fourth nipple removed. Lost a star for me."}
{"text":"Best wings in town! It's always fresh, well it takes a long time when you order but that's why and it's totally worth it. Try Baton Rouge, Bistro size! 
Staff are really polite and friendly. To me it's one of the most underrated wing bars in GTA."}
{"text":"Prices for apps are half price on Sunday which was nice... Chicken tenders were really nice sauced with Buffalo... Service was great and beer was nice and moderately priced. Nachos were not very good due to the paper being stuck on the bottom layer of chips. Bonus was the free ping pong and pool. Would come back to watch a game."}
{"text":"The good, tonnes of TVs, but that's what you expect at a sports bar.

The bad, the food and the prices. It is too expensive for the quality of food that we got. We had about 5 people eating and no one was happy with their order (once they got the actual meal they ordered). Won't be going back."}
{"text":"They have a lot of wing options and a choice between two sizes of wings.  I started going with jumbo recently (bigger ones).  There are a lot of good sauces.  Build your own burger is awesome as is the build your own salad, which i def suggest to make your salad into a wrap.  

Drinks are expensive but thats the area.  Monday night's wing special is def worth going to."}
{"text":"We've been frequent customers of St.Louis and the Bistro for years so we were very excited when we saw a new wing place opening up within walking distances from our home. Unfortunately after trying the wings, I'd still rather go to St.Louis.

This place has way too many choices... three kinds of fries and about a zillion permutations and combinations of wings? To me this is all a sign of \"no culinary vision\". I'm sure somewhere within all of those choices might be a choice that I like but I'd rather just go to St. Louis where they keep it simple and delicious. Who wants to think this hard about wings.

Unfortunately this is a \"cursed\" location for restaurants... I suspect the Right Wing will follow in the tradition."}
{"text":"Fair prices, good atmosphere... my first time here I misplaced our pitcher of beer and it ended up on the floor... the manager (Dave) ended up refilling our pitcher at no cost to us. I recommend this place to anyone I know.!

One grateful patron,
SH"}
{"text":"Ate here for a quick bite with a friend last night before heading to Absolute Comedy Club. Waitress was friendly and quick. Along we a pitcher of Keiths we ordered a quesadilla and clubhouse sandwich. 

The quesadilla was pretty good, got it without chicken, can't complain for the price. The clubhouse was good and bacon was fresh, but it was served on a burger bun that it didn't like. The fries with chipotle mayo is quite yummy. 

There are lots of TVs. I got distracted watching Leafs/Bruins, Raptors/Celtics and some march madness. 

Go with friends, you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"I loved the build your own burger.  I had a chicken burger which was very well seasoned and moist, one of the better ones I've had in a restaurant.   The person I was with had the wings and really enjoyed them.

The only negative for us was that our waitress had a lot of trouble answering our  questions about the menu."}
{"text":"Poor quality wings, very underwhelming and staff that expect tips for not bringing water during the duration of my meal, in spite of me ordering the spiciest wings on their menu. It was funny watching her head to a nearby table and chat with her friends. There's another place in the area that I shall not name that is a ten-fold better. It starts with a d and rhymes with puffs."}
{"text":"Ok so my brother and I are looking for a place to eat near our house so we decide to venture out into the streets and pass this place thinking that it's new and has a bunch of people inside. So we figure that we will try this place out cause the menu looks pretty good with create your own burgers, wraps, and salads with over 50 wing flavors.

So our server comes and ask us what we want within  one minute of giving us the menu. So my brother orders a chicken wrap and I got the create your own burger(turkey burger). We actually got the food within 15 mins which is pretty good. But then the food came and it was just awful. My brothers chicken wrap had only one chicken finger in it with tons of iceberg lettuce and the smallest amount of cheese which was more like left over cheese from the nachos that the last order didn't finish. So I get my turkey burger hoping that it's going to be good but instead I got a burnt bun with a oven roaster burger that hit the grill just for char marks. First of all the onion on the burger was the outer tuff skinned part that your suppose to throw out, then I only got three hot pickled rings on it when I clearly want more. The burger comes with fries but these fries sucked like big time!!! No flavour  and were not fully cooked!!! 

So the whole meal just sucked but the wings looked amazing but we got stuck with the crap!!! 
So afterwards we had to go to Mac's milk to grab ample amounts of Doritos to make up for the worst meal if had this spring/summer"}
{"text":"If I could give less than a star, I would. Came here once, wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Hands down, the WORST place I've ever eaten at in Toronto. Staff are very rude and the food isn't anywhere near worth the price. I ordered hot Buffalo wings and requested them extra crispy. What I got I instead  was 7 tiny and soggy wings that weren't hot or flavourful at all. I mistakenly ordered them for takeout and when I tried to explain to the manager that I didn't get what I paid for, he told me my judgment was off and that his wings were perfect. He didn't allow me to return my full order for a refund or even an exchange. I spent $25 dollars on two pounds of wings that definitely weren't satisfying or fulfilling in any way; lesson learned."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy yet a strong entry into the every growing chicken wing mecca of Toronto. Great variety of flavors/sauces as mentioned in previous posts. All our choices we're done perfectly - buffalo, honey garlic, Cajun & baton rouge. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Second and last time going. First time around it was an alright experience; tasty wings (about 20 different flavors to choose from), reasonably priced pitchers and a plethora of TVs lining the walls. Tonight was a different story: the service was so slow - although still admittedly friendly - I will never go again out of principle. Spent around 45 minutes waiting for the dessert and bill. They appear to be understaffed, so unless you're going at a time when you know it's going to be dead plan on being there for a while."}
{"text":"Nice place 
I would go there again but not with my wife
U have all the old guys trying to pick up younger woman
But nice food friendly service"}
{"text":"The Right Wing sports bar is a recent addition to the many restaurants and bars at Yonge and Eglinton. This wing's place is just a few blocks north of Eglinton on Yonge (previously Agostino's) and boasts lots of seating plus flat screens for sports enthusiasts.
We love wings so figured we'd give this place a try. All I can say is YUM, they have at least 40 flavors of wings....everything from regular bbq to zesty ginger to madras masala. I opted for baton rouge, recommended by the bartender. It's a rating of 3 chillies, and had a sweet kick to it - SO GOOD! 
The prices are reasonable, 1 lb for $9.99 or 2 lbs for $19.99 - keep in mind fries/sides are not included though they come with a couple couple carrot and celery sticks and free dipping sauce (5 flavors). Sides are a variety of fries around $4.75 to $8. We opted for their regular fries which were nice and crunchy. It's a good size basket of fries enough for 2-3 ppl.
The menu also has a good variety of burgers and wraps. Seems like a good place, service was friendly and helpful though a bit slow,  (had to remind the waitress about my fries BUT they didn't end up charging us for the fries! major points for that!) considering it was their first day open, I'd say that's expected. 
It seems like a family run place and a sports bar atmosphere with hockey players framed on the wall, and flat screens (20 of them) playing various sports channels - I'd definitely go back for the wings and also to try their burgers. 
(drinks disclaimer: I don't drink, so there's nothing I can tell you about their bar - sorry!) 

around  $15 per person - the sides are big enough to split though. 

must try: baton rouge wings and curly fries! plus Mondays half-price wings! so there!"}
{"text":"It's Monday night and it's half-price wings. Well, I thought I would take advantage of that. I couldn't believe how tiny the wings were. Pretty much all bone. Not worth it. And to think that if I would've payed full price for them how much more disappointed I would've been. I'm avoiding this place"}
{"text":"Not the best pub to visit. The food was good -- I had the honey sriracha wings -- but the service was slow and arguably the worst I've had in this city. My friend and I were seated without menus for at least ten minutes before anyone came to take our order. The food and drinks came at a good time, but we never received our appetizer. Our server did not return for at least 50 minutes after the food drop off. They continued to serve the tables around us multiple times but never once came back, not even to ask if we wanted more drinks - which we certainly did. We tried to get their attention without being obnoxious but nothing ever came from it. Finally - finally! - after waiting with our empty plates for about ~30 min, the server returned. We ordered one last drink and asked for the bill. The bill came, after another wait, and we were overcharged on almost everything. Won't be returning. I wish I had a better experience because it looks like the people being served are having fun."}
{"text":"I had to post an update to this review, in regards to the offensive, rude, and disrespectful comment posted by, of all people, the MANAGER of The Right Wing Sports Bar.  

Your comment illustrates why your restaurant will never see my business again.  Most people in your position would be looking to see what could be done to improve a customer's view of your establishment, that would be proper customer service.  Instead, you chose to tell me you were happy that I would not be coming back to your location, and called me a liar.  

I do hope that more people avoid this place, after reading your acerbic comment."}
{"text":"I would probably give this place a three, but I've upped my rating by 1 star because they have a sauce called 'The Exorcist' that it the hottest freaking sauce I've ever had! I mean, give you a nosebleed kind of hot! For those of you who don't know how insane I am with the heat, just TRY to eat these wings. I freaking double dog dare you with a Preparation H wipe on top!!! I managed to get through 9 jumbo non breaded wings doused in this stuff and the rush was out of this world. It kept on creeping and I was about to do some sort of aerobic exercise to try and distract my mind and my mouth from all the craziness that was going on.

Aside from this freakshow item, they have build our own salads or build your own burgers. Lots of good pubby food and TV's galore. It's a great spot to come with a group of friends to watch the game. Monday night is 1/2 price wing night, too!

Service is usually efficient and on the ball. They have to be with so many food modifiers. I've been here many times and will come back again and again for wings as the jumbo ones are among the best I've had anywhere in the city-- even without 'The Exorcist'."}
{"text":"uuugggg, Weak. 
The nachos were terrible. 
Expensive, pathetically few chips, awful toppings...we didn't order a salad! this is a sports bar, for goodness sake! what's with the ton of raw lettuce on the nachos? and the cheese...non existent. I'm not sure the cook has ever had nachos...

service...oh my. i thought she was from SoCal with her valley girl accent. sweet, but completely clueless and ditzy about the menu

Completely overpriced. won't be back, sorry"}
{"text":"The Right Wing is a surprisingly OK spot.  Its floors are generally covered in spilled drinks and urine (if you're downstairs), but the staff is dependable and the wings are actually quite good.  There's a range of wing styles and flavours.  Overpriced for what it serves, but that's most places these days."}
{"text":"VERY good wings.

We sat on the small patio and really enjoyed the wings. Get the jumbo size, they're juicy and cooked perfectly. I got my usual Suicide on the side, and it was quite spicy. Service was friendly.

The only issue I had with this place is that there were some men there that I think were regulars, smoking not 2 feet away and having super loud conversations over our heads the entire time we were there. It was incredibly annoying. 

I'd be back, but I think we'll take a seat inside."}
{"text":"Pros:

Great chicken wings - had the exorcist wings and they were scorchingly hot but also had a good flavour and texture
Value - Went on a Friday night which had wings and fries with celery for $11, great price for the amount of food

Cons:
Beer - they only serve beer made by InBev or MolsonCoors, they used to serve Amsterdam craft but since only sell fake craft beer like Creemore or Mill St
Atmosphere - generic sports bar atmosphere, nothing special and not my scene

I prefer Duff's but when in Midtown be I'll gladly return for more wings, maybe only suicide next time"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!! Everything about this place is terrible. I came for dinner with my husband on a Sunday. We waited at the front for 5 minutes before our presence was acknowledge by a drunken waitress who was sitting at the bar. We were told to grab a seat anywhere, the restaurant itself is not very big. We waited another 5 minutes before a waitress came to drop menus off without even saying hello. We proceeded to order 3 pounds of wings and a salad that had \"fresh berries\" on it. When the food arrived the salad had frozen solid strawberries and 2 pounds of wings were cold. The server never came back after dropping the food off to follow up with us. The kitchen is completely open and viewable to the guests. We could see a few men going in and out of the kitchen who clearly did not work there (looked like they had not showered in a few days).  Save your money and your time. I would highly recommend avoiding this place at all costs.  I would give this place zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"Ordered from just eats .. delivery was prompt .. however the wings did not have enough sauce and we're really small .. they had the nerve to charge me a tip for subpar food"}
{"text":"Great wings, great service - they even have a loyalty program! This place has become the new favorite for wings amongst my friends :)"}
{"text":"Very tasty food.  Have ordered several times for Work meals.  
Only gripe is small small amount of fries that come with your burger.   
Other than that very taste and fast service. 
Great place to watch UFC also"}
{"text":"I always end up at The Right Wing when I'm in the mood for some wings and beer, and I'm never disappointed with the service and food.  Standard pub fare is served, alongside a hefty menu of wing flavours and plenty of beer choices.  Great Midtown spot and seems like a great place to watch sporting events with your friends."}
{"text":"Randomly picked this restaurant while walking on Yonge street. I tried my first bison burger and was very impressed! It is one of the best burger I had in a while. I would of never expected that from this joint.
I also tried some of their salads and was as impressed. The service is nice and has a nice patio in the summer.
The only reason why I would put a four star is that the chairs and tables are not very stable. The outdoor tables were quite small and got pretty uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Fantastic wings. 4 stars for some quality wings and entertainment. This place can be a great local watering hole. There are some solid drink deals and tons of TV screens throughout. Best part is the dart boards,  pool tables, foosball table, and ping pong table. Great to bring some friends and enjoy some friendly competition with some buddies. Service was friendly, wings took some time to come out. Happy with my first visit. *Take advantage of half price wings on Monday."}
{"text":"The right wing, has some of the best wings in town! - Can't go wrong, and fair prices, half price wing mondays!"}
{"text":"Ok,  here is the scoop on this Wing Place.
It is owner Operated,and seems to have some of the best wings I've ever tasted.....
I prefer the Island Heat, but have tried just about all of the flavors.  When I ge there with my friends, we tend to order the sampler platter of wings.
I'm also a BIG fan of their \"Build Your Own Salad\" UMMMMMMMM.
Anyways, the food is great, and I don't think there is a seat in the place where you CAN'T see the TV's from.
Oh, I think I forgot to mention the great staff.
One of the things I like most about this place is that if your not happy, they will do what ever it takes to fix it!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

I am not sure why everyone is hating on this place!

After a grueling 13 hour shift all I want is beer fried food and a friendly face and this place delivered! The first time I came here I didn't check Yelp to see what everyone had to say until after my meal arrived, so I was actually surprised by the reviews and low ratings. The food here is good for pub food and I have never encountered any issues with the staff, in fact they are usually pretty chatty and sweet.

The wings are pretty good (I usually get the lemon peppercorn) and they are half price Mondays after 5pm. The small outdoor patio usually has a few spots open, even on a Friday night.

The build your own burger and salad menus are great and the skate lace fries rock (ask for dill garlic dipping sauce instead of the thousand island crap it comes with)."}
{"text":"Decided to walk in here to grab a quick bite and expected something on par with St. Louis given the humble sports decor. I ordered the 3rd degree hot flavour based on the server's recommendation and I was pleasantly surprised to find the wings here are pretty solid. You can get them double dusted with a wide selection of sauces and dry rubs. Everyone I was with ate wings so we didn't try anything else, but we all enjoyed them. I'm pretty sure these are the best wings in the Yonge and Eglinton area and are well worth your time if your looking for a tasty meal."}
{"text":"WOW, went here a couple of weekend's ago and this place knew how to get it right. A few friends of mine were heading downtown for some drinks where we were forced to get off at Eglinton due to a subway closure. We then started walking north for a pub but didn't see anything but kept walking anyways.. it was a good 10 - 15 min walk North when we came across this little hidden gem. We thought wings and beer.. GREAT combo.

Being Saturday night they had a special going on for 2 lbs of wings for $19.99. I didn't feel like that manny so i just ordered a single. I was amazed at the options this place had. You are able to custom your own burger, salad, and WINGS.. when I ordered my wings I was given then choice JUMBO or CRISPY!! Where else have you ever been given that choice.. well I certainly have never which is why I was taken back by the whole thing. I also ordered the freckles.. which are deep fried pickles and they were cooked to perfection. I have been to places where the breading comes off after one bite and you are left with just the pickle, but not this place, they know what they are doing. My friend ordered himself a poutine and the portion was a great size. I also tried some and enjoyed the flavour of the gravy. He too had the option or curly fries, sweet potato fries or regular. He went with regular.. This place is all about giving the customers CHOICE and I enjoy that!! 

This night ended up being a fortunate accident and I will be back for sure since it is only a short 15 min subway ride from my place.."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience with booking a staff party, I called over a month in advance to book the party room in the basement for a group of twelve of us. They told me no problem and I was all booked from 7:15pm-12am. My reservation was for November 26th, I got a voice-mail on November 24th saying that they are just confirming my reservation and they will have us set up in the back, with lots of tvs and it should be great. I found this odd as I had booked the basement. I called back the next day, when I got the chance and wasn't at work. Turns out they \"booked someone before we booked and the downstairs is not available\" first of all, how do you double book a party room, you either have someone written down for that day or you don't, and if you do you tell me when I call that the room is not available instead of saying no problem. Second, I'm pretty sure no one booked before me, I'm sure a party called after me that was bigger than my party and they wanted to make more money so they went ahead and booked them in for the basement and threw us upstairs, because they knew with two days notice I wouldn't be able to find anywhere else to accommodate a group of 12. I am still extremely pissed off about this, it is terrible customer service and it should not have happened and we should have had some sort of compensation for it happening. What did we get?? A free platter of apps...joy. On top of all of this, they forgot to make one of my coworkers meals completely, needless to say we went straight to the owner and made sure they compt the meal. Which is one of the things I am happy about. Another thing that irritated me is the waitress was doing great and then near the end she didn't come and check on us for at least an hour, she never filled our pitchers of waters back up, let all our drinks get empty didn't bother to ask if we wanted another round ( we were drinking alcohol) and one if my biggest pet peeves is for my glass to be empty and me not even get an offer. One of my coworkers who left a bit early actually had to go up and pay because the waitress to long to come back. 
It is very unfortunate that this all happened not to just a small group but a large group because the food is good here, service on the other hand, terrible. Even other times I have gone the waitresses are not very attentive. On tip of ALL of this, they canceled my reservation for an 18 year Olds birthday party!! They aren't even legal, not like they were making lots of money from alcohol. They need to smarten up with there customer service, because they would have made alot more money off of us because we would have stayed much longer if we had our own party room. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"I like the wings here a lot! The servers are nice and prompt. My only negative is the inconsistency in sauce. Some days spicy some not so saucy. I don't like that... I do like the fries, either blade or curly :) sauces are Connie Smyth and Honey of a Hattrick. Lots of tvs and there's pool and darts downstairs."}
{"text":"When we lived at young and eglinton My fiancé and I used this place as our local watering hole after exceptionally long days at work where we felt the need for self indulgence. We still visit back every once in a while for the wings. 
We only go here for the wings as the selection available is huge and interesting. We both choose different styles each time we go and have rarely been dissapointed. 
The choice of fires are great and the dipping sauces are tasty too.  
The decor is a little nasty but it's a sports bar and not a restaurant so you have to take it for what it is really.
Overall I'd say this place was a reasonable, simple place to have some reasonable simple food. if you're a sports fan wanting to watch a game and have some snacks definitely give this place a try."}
