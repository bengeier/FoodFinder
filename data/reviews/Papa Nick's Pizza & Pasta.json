{"text":"The pizza is fantastic. The ingredients are always fresh. I have never had a bad experience. Plus, they have a wide range of delivery! Great news for this west parker. 5stars, every time"}
{"text":"I was looking for pizza on Clifton and came across Papa's. So I walked inside and decide to get a slice, Being from New York I didn't think I was gonna like their slice. Boy was I wrong, besides the great and friendly service that slice was delicious! It's nice going to a place and they treat you with respect even if they don't know who you are, that says a lot! So whenever I'm in Cleveland I'm going to stop at Papas!"}
{"text":"The bread sticks were awesome. The pizza was good, but had a bit too much sauce. My friend liked the buffalo chicken wrap."}
{"text":"I'll just say it- this spot is as close to L&B Spumoni Gardens (Brooklyn, NY) as I've been able to find.  And it's close to my apartment.  And they deliver FAST.  I love the place; I usually get a Half Sheet.  I have, however; gotten some of their pasta dishes which are FABULOUS!!!  I've called in an order to pick up on my way home and they were quick then as well.  This place is great- I don't know what more to say!"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice, first time in the summer of 2004 with some out of town friends. It was all around good. We all enjoyed our meals. And here is the reason for the low rating. My boyfriend and I went back, with the same out of town friend, Nov 2008 and the quality of the food had dropped to below standards. The service was fair and that is being kind. the appetizer was cold and flavorless. The pizza we had was barely cooked and I'm still suffering for it 3 hours later. If you enjoy sucking down a vast amount of pepto-bismol you will love this establishment. If not skip this place at all cost. I would head to Pizza Hut before going back to Papa Nick's."}
{"text":"Great food! The prices are right, service and ownership are always nice and welcoming. If you try Papa Nicks go for a calzone. They are huge and the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza! Ordered delivery, topped with sausage,pepperoni,& onions, with an order of teriyaki wingettes.  Taking into consideration the delivery of the food, the temperature could have been better.  However, the wings for my taste could be more petite; they're good thou."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza over the phone for pick up, I had just moved to lakewood and was told this is the spot to grab a good pie. When I went to pick it up all the workers were just sitting around talking or smoke outside. I asked to pick up my order and they had no clue what I was looking to pick up. They had to scurry around to find the lady who took the order only to find out shit missplaced the order and it was never even made. Mistakes happen but I will not order from them again."}
{"text":"Excellent service and quality food. Try the rigatoni with meat sauce. Also a dinner salad with creamy Italian!"}
{"text":"What happened to this joint?   Sub-par pizza.. Very pricey... And thin as paper.  No way anymore!!!"}
{"text":"I have had one positive experience here , and one extremely bad.  The first came when I ordered a large pizza with pep and cheese on it.  It was perfect, delicious, crisp and butter crust.  Everything you would want in a pizza.  So this outcome warrented another order.  However, this is when the shit hit the fan. The buzzer rings and I tell the delivery man I am on my way down.  It was mere moments before I got down there and the guy had a look on his face as if I decided to take a shower and shave before coming down. Seriously, it was maybe 90 seconds before I got down there.  The pizza was on the ground and the guy had a horrible atitude about him. (Now, this is partly my fault, I should of inspected the pizza before I let him leave, but I guess i just didn't think i needed to..) Anyways, I pay the guy and take the zaza upstairs. Everything had slid off the pizza.  The cheese was over the crust, and there was nothing left on the pizza itself.  When the delivery guy set the pizza down, he set it down violently and at an angle.  This lead to one of the worst pizza experiences I have ever had.  I am still unsure if I will ever order from here again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we've been disappointed the last 2 times we've gone. Originally, heard about this place on New Day Cleveland in 2016. Our first few times, the pizzas were yeasty and tasty. Not so much lately. The latest pizzas we've ordered were almost \"cracker like\" thin, and tasteless, crusty dough. Don't know if there has been a change of ownership or chefs which may explain the difference. I have not tried the deep dish style but don't know if I will return to try it. Disappointed because I prefer to patronize independent restaurants instead of the big chain ones."}
{"text":"We grabbed a pizza to bring home from Papa Nick's.
We put in our order and then walked over to Big Fun.
Our pizza was ready for us when we were ready 
and the people working were pretty nice.
We ordered a pepperoni pizza with mushrooms,
some wings and a salad.
The salad was good, it was a nice companion with the pizza.
The pizza was also good, everything was up to standards.
Big floppy greasy pieces of pizza,
nice and cheesy, a good balance of pepperoni and mushrooms.
The sauce and crust are standard, nothing remarkable."}
{"text":"Love their sausage! Sausage pizza, sausage sandwich or sausage on pasta. It is the best tasting sausage around. Love Papa Nick's freshness and quality. Just about everything is home made: sauce, meatballs, chicken and veal, soups...the list goes on and on. It's a gem of a place."}
{"text":"I'd rather have store bought pizza from a box than eat this crap. My wife and I like to try different pizza shops so we tried Papa Nick's. Over priced and really bland, absolutely no taste. OMG , put some seasoning in your sauce. The crust tastes like card board. Save your money and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in the Cleveland area in my opinion. Love the crust on their pizza and the sauce is soooooo tasty. Love this pizza. Only wish they would build a larger dining area."}
{"text":"I have been in the area for 6 years and the pizzas were usually hit or miss. Sometimes they are too greasy and the cheese slides right off the slice and the sauce is watered down.

Instead of getting a pepperoni and banana pepper medium pizza , I just got it without the pepperoni and I notice there are new employee's. The sauce taste incredibly better, wasn't as greasy (maybe due to holding the pepperoni) and it wasn't watered down at all.

Was the best tasting pizza I ate from there in awhile."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what grossed me out more: the pasty, tasteless red sauce or the pasty, tasteless middle aged couple humping at the table next to me.  

I really love that this place has been here for some 30 years, but boy oh boy could the food be better.  At least the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Love it! 

Seriously. 

Small. Cozy. Unpretentious. Good, stable Italian cooking. Get the cheese ravioli or any of their pizzas. All are delicious. Nix stix are the highlight of any evening. Nix stix are freaking delicious, buttery, garlicky breadsticks served alongside a deep saucer of marinara. Seriously good eats. 

There are high-top tables near the front windows which make sitting their in primetime hours a perfect spot to observe a the busy-ness of Clifton Ave after work let's out. Its also quite cozy after the sun droops below the horizon. 

Not much more to say now. Stop in anytime and you'll probably have a nice time."}
{"text":"I do not want to consider myself a Pizza connoisseur but I LOVE PIZZA! When I had moved to Lakewood a friend of mine got me a gift certificate as a welcome to Lakewood present.  

I decided to order it in one night when I wanted to stay in and was told if I ever got it I had to get the Nix Sticks.  So I got an order of those and then just a small pepperoni pizza. When I got it delivered the box by Nix Sticks came in was bigger than my pizza so I was interested to see what my friend had got me into. 

The first bite was heavenly!  They are not your normal bread stick but more of a pizza crust stick.  They are some of the best bread sticks I have ever had!! 

Then I moved onto a piece of the pizza.  It was just eh to me.  I didn't really enjoy the sauce on the pizza and they barely put any pepperoni on it (unlike this picture I am staring at below while I right this?).  I can't decide if the sauce was tasteless or bad but I didn't want to eat any more of it.   I had one small slice, wasn't thrilled and went back to the Nix Sticks."}
{"text":"I had heard from multiple Lakewood residents that Lakewood was the best pizza around, but the dough was barely cooked.  ick!  (the sauce was decent, though)."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Papa Nick's.   I had lunch with a girlfriend who grew up in the neighborhood and thought that I would enjoy this place.  I must say, I did enjoy my lunch.   The place is small & cozy.  We were warmly greeted upon entering and chose a window seat.   We both ordered pasta meals which comes with salad and homemade italian bread w/butter.   I ordered the rigatoni with mushroom sauce ($7.00) and italian sausage (+$1.50).  The house salad consisted of lettuce, slightly spicy whole pepper, pepperoni and lots of fresh mozzarella cheese.  I opted for the house dressing, which was tangy and very flavorful.   The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce, mushrooms and sausage, paired perfectly.  The serving was more than ample, I boxed more than 1/2 to take home (probably ate more bread than I should have:-).   All in all, this was a great meal and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Every time my friend comes in from Florida this is always her first stop. It's an awesome little pizza parlor where you can still sit and enjoy a delicious pizza and antipasto.  We ordered a deluxe pizza and it was loaded with pepperoni and sausage, fresh mushrooms and onion. They offered a nice selection of domestic beers and wines. Nice place to have a relaxing bite to eat and catch up.....I love this place"}
{"text":"I have tried a few of their sandwiches.  They are really good and plenty of fillings.  My only complaint on them is the heavy handed salt content.  Really salty.  Delivery is quick and food is always hot.  Just need to lighten up on the salt and then I'd give it a 5."}
{"text":"I don't like writing bad reviews but unfortunately I can't say anything great. The food was okay. The atmosphere was okay. Everything was okay.  

What hurts me most though is that they have such a good start. 
For example; the Mac and cheese I ordered smelled amazing! It had those nice toasted little crumbs on top and the cheese itself was decent but it just wasn't complete. It lacked some sort of kick or extra excitement in the flavor. Even if they just added like a hint of buffalo sauce and some fresh celery for example, make it somewhat a buffalo Mac and cheese, that would elevate it to a whole new level. Or maybe even just different seasoning. 
The buffalo chicken sandwich had a great start too but it just seemed like some things didn't fit in it or it was missing something. 
It's a shame too, this place has great potential. Great location, potentially good atmosphere, loyal locals. So close, but not quite..."}
{"text":"This is a good option for delivery pizza with a savory sauce and chewy crust. 

Normally we're Angelo's Pizza people, but you get sick of eating the same take-out pizza all the time, right? Plus, while I enjoy Angelo's, it's rare that I like bakery-style, deep dish pie like that with sweet sauce. Also, the past few times we've been the last stop on their delivery route. And you know what that means? Luke-warm, congealed cheese pizza. Yuck. I know they're trying to save time, but I want hot pizza. 

Papa Nick's helps us with hot delivery pizza because we're so close. Is it the most amazing pizza I've ever had? No. But it's a better delivery option for us, as stated above. 

One thing I'm not a huge fan of though is how much more expensive Papa Nick's is compared to Angelo's. I believe there is a delivery fee, as well."}
{"text":"Weekday lunch at Papa Nick's.  The dining room is small, but it wasn't at all crowded.  The pepperoni and mushroom pizza was pretty good and the 8 slices (medium, I think) was plenty enough for two hungry diners.  Good sauce and a generous layer of pepperoni to boot.  I am by no means a pizza aficionado, but the pizza was better than the major national chains, so that's at least one threshold passed in my book.

The really great thing was that I made it there, had a leisurely lunch, and got back to downtown in about an hour thanks to the quick service.  Downsides?  I'm not crazy about getting Coke in a can when I'm eating out."}
{"text":"First thing first...They Deliver!!! Ordered pizza here for the first time last night and was semi-impressed. I was super excited that they delivered, cause I didn't want chain pizza and wanted to try something new.  We ordered a large sausage, onion, green pepper pizza and came to our door piping hot! The pizza was kinda on the thin side. Only downfall was it was kinda burnt on the bottom. Definitely will give it another try!"}
{"text":"I dont usually review pizza places ( or italian places for that matter).  To me pizza is a vessel to cram as much filler in my body either before or after drinking.  I have gotten here about 5 times now and I have to say I really like it as far as pizza goes!  You can tell the sauce has been cooked for a while and all the flavors have been condenced.  Cheese is super good too.  The crust is a tad thicker than I like.  Having lived in NYC I know what pizza should be...nice and thin.  This is a mix between thin NY style and that thick,  bullcrap cassserole style Chicago calls pizza.  They always have coupons in the All Around Town book and Entertainment book too.  I will be trying more stuff soon enough.  I havnt tried delivery I just pick it up.  I see yelpers complain about delivery time when they could of just got off their asses and went and picked it up.  Its like waiting in a line for coffe and doughnuts in the morning when the line is a mile long and inside the store is empty.  But thats 'Murica for ya.  This place also sells beer and has dope lunch specials for what I see on the flyers.  So, throw on your track suit, pinky ring and come get yer Deigo on!"}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a small pizza if I bought a large. Would not recommend Papa Nicks Pizza. The other items on the menu may be good, but I will never know, based on the pizza. Crust was marginal, and the pizza price was as much as Angelo's in Lakewood, save your money and go Angelo's or elsewhere and get a pizza pie!"}
{"text":"I love papa nicks! Great staff and service and great pizza! If you haven't tried it you should!"}
{"text":"We only ate here because my parents had frequented this shop when they were first married. I'm extremely disappointed we didn't keep driving a little further to Melt! Their pizza is just ok. If you live close and want something to eat, I would check it out, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here though. I wouldn't ever go out of my way to eat here again, but if I had to eat here I wouldn't be too upset either. It was just ok. 

Our waitress was very friendly, they have an interesting pop selection, the place was pretty clean. The bathroom is in a slightly creepy basement."}
{"text":"the pizza was OK but not as good as many other pizza places in Cleveland. The dining room is very small and parking is in the back of the shopping strip, or on Clifton Blvd. The mens room downstairs smelled like stale urine and a mildly unpleasant odor could be detected in the restaurant as well. I wouldn't recommend it unless all other pizza places are closed or you are starving and can't wait to drive somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is not good at all. One server for a jam packed place! 
They give huge portions too so you get what you pay for. 
Two recommendation, when its 80 degrees outside turn on the air! It was a heat fill tiny space with lots of bodies! Ease up on the sauce on the dishes and pizza."}
{"text":"Soggy pizza!  I think my picture is on here of that soupy Za they handed to me.  Had to re-bake the Za in my own oven when I got home and it still fell thru the oven grates!  I've seen better pizza in hotel hallways the next morning."}
{"text":"If you want a quick but delicious lunch this is definitely the place! The macaroni salad is AMAZING! I had the chicken Caesar wrap and it was pressed so it was warm and wonderful. I will definitely be returning and you should definitely stop in. They are so welcoming!

Update: I tried the pizza! Holy crap it is OUTSTANDING! You can tell great care and love  goes into each of his pizzas! Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll definitely make a stop here, and you should definitely make your way to lunch or dinner here sometime soon!"}
{"text":"What happened? I always loved the pizza here! Just had a pizza that was little better then cardboard with catsup on it. Seriously, Papa Johns ic better then this crap. Don't know what happened but it sure sucks now."}
{"text":"I am moving back closer to Lakewood and I will be a few blocks from Papa Nick's. I had a few friends that worked here growing up and always enjoyed the pizza. It is nothing spectacular and definitely not as bad as the reviewers on here make it out to be. My family would come here occassionally and nobody really complained. It is a great option for a little neighborhood place to eat."}
{"text":"This pizza place had a very great feel to it. I liked how friendly our waiter was. Pizza was good. I will return."}
{"text":"Had some not so great meals here over the years since my initial review, but today's meal reinforced my rating. I was usually in this hood after midnight and the de facto food option was always Gepetto's(Nick's being closed to night owls). They have since demolished Gepetto's and Nick's again rules the Clifton roost(conspiracy?). 
Today me and the pooch ventured out for Arby's and I thought, you know what I bet Nick's makes a cheesesteak of some sort. They do, and it's pretty good. Came with au jus and fries for the price some shitty Arby's would have cost me. Just had to wait ten minutes. Also got a half sheet plain for my veggie wife. While the area is basically a potholed, torn down buildings warzone presently, by the time of the summer Clifton Arts Fest, I see a very attractive area coming to life. And Nick's will hold it down like they have for decades."}
{"text":"I would have to say that as a new customer this Pizza was pretty good. I had gone on a trip to NYC last week and ate pizza the whole time I was there. Came back home and my fiancé wanted some pizza. So me with the craving of thin crust, I came across Papa Nicks. It was awesome. But I would've just gave it a little more toast crisp to the crust and maaaan. A-1. But yeah, This was a great pizza."}
