{"text":"This place is amazing.  Great coffee and tea, wonderful light lunch (fresh healthy soups and whole wheat non enriched baguettes).  Owners are so pleasant and helpful.  Try it - you won't be disappointed !  If you are expecting bitter \"Starbuck's like\" coffee- then just go to Starbuck's but if you appreciate better coffee and other pastries, then you will love it here!"}
{"text":"Lovely café, it feels like home for the French girl that I am :) People, try some amazing French products, the French culture doesn't stop at baguettes and croissants ;)   (And awesome staff too :) )"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Angelina's hot chocolate as I have visited the salon in Paris twice and loved it.  It is more like sipping chocolate and very filling. Similar to the one at moroc chocolat but twice the amount.  The owner is very knowledgeable of her products and will help pick the perfect gift! They have chocolates, baked goods and tea straight from France. Their butter cookies are really as good as it gets in Toronto.  I thought the waiter and the waitress outfits were very Parisian and cute"}
{"text":"First visit to Douce France.   Usually I go to other pastry/coffee shops in the area and I'll continue to go to other pastry shops in the area. My friend and I were the only ones there on a weekday afternoon.   GOOD THINGS: Lots of variety of interesting pastries not readily available elsewhere. clean. washrooms above average compared to nearby ones). chocolates we had were good.  NOT SO GOOD:  It's not clear what kind of shop this is when you enter! Can you get coffee here? Is this a chocolatier? Is this a coffee shop?  It felt hard to have a conversation as felt we were in someone's kitchen. Not a relaxing coffee date. A bit pricey in this store. (you pay for the pretentiousness of the place and you'll be made to feel it's worth it). No cakes and normal pastries. Mostly cookies. Menu not clear. Five page menu but can't figure it out.   They push the French aspect a little too much. Overdone, I'm sorry.  It's quite pretentious actually. Perhaps because only the two of us.  This is Toronto, we like a bit more toned down!! Some will like this, I'm sure. We didn't. I can tell many others i met that the same story gets told over and over to visits which is the following:  Same script for every customer (\"bonjour\" upon entering the store, and \"bonjour\" again if you don't answer anything back,  \"drink our hot chocolate which they wait in line 1 hours in Paris\"). Pushy to buy products.  \"This is a prestigious store\". If you don't hear the word prestigious at least once when you are in here, I'd be shocked.  They'll tell you this is just as good as in Paris and that is just as good as in Paris and so on and so on. They'll tell you the music you are listening too is French.  Too scripted and forced for my own liking.  It's OK store, but they need to really get down to what people in this area want! Great opportunity to be successful because they offer a different product.  It has alot of potential and I'll be back in the summer to try again. I think it would be helpful to really get the store brand clear.  Potential is there. need to get to the heart of the customers.  Tone down the \"prestige\" !!!"}
{"text":"++ butter cookies from Brittany are delicious.  ++ you can find goods from France (I'm French) that is impossible to find anywhere else in Toronto ++ good chocolate -- staff is a bit overwhelming and uptight, talking to you in French the second you enter without knowing if you speak it or not. Usually I like when it's done in a simply manner (like at Crepe a gogo downtown) but in this case it's a bit staged and too much. Also I find the owner to be really pushy for you to buy stuff saying that it's the best of the best of the best bla bla bla -- their croissants and pains au chocolat brought frozen from France simply suck and are way overpriced"}
{"text":"Love this place. Everything was so delicious and decadent. We had some canelés and the famous Hot chocolate. They service was great friendly and helpful. Nice quiet place to chat with a friend or for a meeting but also had a constant stream of people in and out so you know it's a popular place. We had some allergy concerns and the staff were very helpful showing us the information sheets for each pastry so we could be sure there would be no problems."}
{"text":"Everything here is extremely expensive but very worth it. The lady that owns the store couldn't be more knowledgable about all the products in her store. Even if your budget doesn't include indulging on expensive treats straight from France, the store does have small candies and small packs of delicious biscuits that very affordable and worth every penny."}
{"text":"Douce France is one of my favourite places in the neighbourhood.   The staff are so friendly, making recommendations and telling you details about all the products they have to offer. Of course, the Angelina's hot chocolate is to die for and the other sweets are also delicious.  It can get a bit cramped if there are a lot of people sitting down, but being busy is a good sign!   It's a bit pricey, but given that most of the products are imported, that makes sense."}
{"text":"When I came here I immediately felt like I was in France. The people who work here are so hospitable , welcoming n friendly. They even greet you in French at the door . They have an assortment of sweets direct from France. I only had their creme brûlée so far. Can't wait to come back to try more stuff. Bonus; washrooms are very clean ."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this cafe! Great ambiance, great owners, great coffee and baked products! And to top it all it's all imported from Paris. Try it out if you are at Yonge and Eg..."}
{"text":"Absolument génial! I'm so glad I found this place recently; it's definitely my favourite café in Toronto now. You'd swear you were stepping across the ocean to France. There's beautiful french music in the background, an incredible selection of genuine french treats, and absolutely lovely staff who always greet you with a 'bonjour'. :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live the neighborhood and this is our first time here. We should have come here much sooner.   The staff are all from France and extremely friendly.   You MUST try the hot chocolate (apparently people wait in line for an hour in Paris for this). You have never had hot chocolate like this.   They play great French music and have a lot of great packages of pastry to buy for home as well.   Enjoy   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I'm going to miss this place when I move away... First off... The Angelina's hot chocolate was divine... I actually felt sleepy afterwards and wished I could have been at home lazing in front of my TV but alas it's only served there. It's pricey at $10 but worth it in my opinion!  I've tried most of their imported baked goods and despite my initial skepticism about being flown in from so far away and the thoughts of compromised tastes/freshness I was pleasantly surprised by the delicate flavours... I've taken these items as gifts as well as for myself and no complaints at a all except for the wish that I could ACTUALLY live in Paris!  I do wish they had some savoury items and a bakery in the back lol but I don't think those are realistic concepts..."}
{"text":"I visited Douce France last Saturday. It is a small place with few seating and some chairs on the patio. I tried 3 pieces of sweets and a coffee. The coffee is ordinary nothing special but I liked their desert. They are fresh, flaky and not very sweet which is to my liking (like Canadian deserts are loaded with sugar).  They have only few of each kind, once finished they replenish. So you have to wait till the new small batch is baked if you want to taste a specific kind. The place is little crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"I bought a galette des rois there a few days ago.  It was excellent.  I look forward to going back to try other treats."}
{"text":"Douce France is a nice French place. Their decoration is beautiful. They have comfortable seats and tables. Their service is very pleasant. Their bathroom is very clean. I have good time there. Their chocolate is very popular, but I am not impressed with so much. It is pricey, so you have some expectation that taste and quality must be good... but I feel betrayed. However, the service and atmosphere are good, so I am giving Douce France three stars."}
{"text":"So lucky to have this wonderful place in my neighbourhood! I love how they greet all the customers in French, \"Bonjour, ça va bien?\" They have a beautiful selection of teas that come in generous pots. We had the velouté soups green and tomato with a side of their delicious bread. The crust on the loaf is perfection. We saw another customer having what looked like the best hot chocolate in the world: hot milk, cream and a small pitcher of pure melted chocolate. You mix your own to your liking. Mmm. They can do groups for all day tea platters. I want to try that next time."}
{"text":"Every time I step into this shop, I feel like I'm in Paris. Delightful baked goods and macrons, croissants, and treats. Everything is shipped from France and baked in-house. A large selection of fine chocolates and petit fours!  There are a few tables if you want to stay for a coffee. The shop is a short walk from Eglinton Station -  easier than flying to Europe!  Bon apetit! :D"}
{"text":"Run by an enterprising Francophone lady who I think deserves kudos for her efforts. Definitely better than chocolates at Godiva or Other generic brands, but perhaps on par with Leonidas. But definitely has an extensive selection of items. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"I'm so glad to see this place is successful, so I don't have to feel bad about avoiding it. When they opened up, they were trying so hard. My husband and I had a coffee there and it was an awkward, weird experience. A poor costumed (French?) teenager had to serve us the coffee and bring us a bottle of water. It seemed forced and cringe-inducing. They have excellent products though, and I wish them the best."}
{"text":"I visited Douce France three weeks ago and I return to visit again on Christmas Eve for my afternoon tea with two friends. We all loved everything we tried there. I got more surprises than last visit. I bought their glazed chestnut this time. For sure will go back visiting again and again..."}
{"text":"Such a lovely place! The food is delicious & imported directly from France. Try the hot chocolate - you won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"This is one of those gems in the neighborhood. If you want delicious French treats sold by a knowledgeable (but unpretentious) staff this is it.   I got the French macarons on a few occassions and they are probably some of the best I've had in Toronto. They have that chew you want, not hollow or brittle and not too sweet (a problem with a lot of the ones sold here... just taste like sugar!). These are imported straight from Paris so it's the real deal.   Also the butter palmers are heavenly. the perfect pairing with tea. I also quite like their croissants (both butter and chocolate). I haven't tried the chocolates but I always see people getting them when I come in.  They definitely prefer cash when you are only buying a few things so come prepared!"}
{"text":"A great place for a cafe au lait. I shared the creme brûlée on my visit, it was delicious and creamy. I bought two packages of madeleines, all great tasting however they were pricey at $14 per package. The patio is a bit cramped, 4 tables with 2 chairs to each. Although, there's plenty of seating room inside. Worth the visit, especially if you're a lover of anything French!"}
{"text":"This is such a nice little shop. I live down the street and decided to come in when my roommate informed me that he had just stopped in to bring some desserts for a dinner party. He said that the woman who works there will always greet you in French and that everyone is super friendly!   I lived in France for two years and jumped at the chance to enjoy a Toronto-French patisserie of sorts. The chocolates were really good, although I felt a bit expensive. Nonetheless, it's a fun place to stop in and treat yourself to some chocolates and sweets."}
{"text":"Lovely, quaint cafe. The pastries are made in France and baked fresh inside. And when I say fresh, I mean fresh. We stayed for over an hour and saw many batches of the delicious apple turnovers (pommes aux chaussons) come and go... a few by me, of course. The staff were very friendly and accommodated a rather large party, delivering superb service.  Some people have mentioned the pastries are oily. The apple turnovers are very buttery, much more so than the stuff we usually get served in Toronto. Many Canadian pâtisseries do not use 100% butter and finding European style butter is also rare. So, those may be richer than you're used to. The croissants however did not come across as 'too buttery' to me. Of the croissant type items fir sale, the apple is the richest.  I like Ve the wide assortment of jams, olives, and all around delicious French items for sale. A great place to come to buy a hostess gift or grab a king cake for a celebration."}
{"text":"Nice place to go if you are craving some Angelina hot chocolate.  When we were in Paris my husband LOVED Angelina's hot chocolate.  I've been trying to find a place that sells the mix but it is near impossible.  Going to Cafe Douce is the next best thing if you want relive the experience.  Other than that, everything else is just okay.  The store has a variety of baked goods which they say is from France.  I think the batter/mix is pre made and then they just bake it at their store.  I tried their pain au chocolate and their baguette.  It was just okay and a bit overpriced.  They also have lots of different foods for gifts (olives, cookies, jams, etc)."}
{"text":"I love chocolates, patisserie and sweets.  This is the place to go. My kids loves the Angelina chocolate drink, my husband loves the cafe' cream, Madeline. I love the chocolates, tarts, marzipan balls. I like the idea that they offer soup, baguette and croissants. Yes, its a bit pricey but the food are authentically and delightfully delicious, made to perfection, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I had been following this place on yelp for a few months and was so excited to try it on my trip to Toronto. I'm so glad I did because this place is a gem! My group dined in for a light brunch. I had the Notre Dame for two people it was 2 servings of tea,  the best blue cheese, homemade  crackers, a candied clementine and chocolates. It was like a symphony of flavors in your mouth! I especially love the candid clementine. My Friends ordered some of the pastries. They were also amazing! Like everything else in the store that is imported from France I bought a bottle of the framboise syrup that is which by the way is like no other syrup you will try! The macrons were so much better than I have ever had! I was told that they will start selling cheese soon. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The cookies are consistently amazing and the service is great. Very authentic. The next best thing to living in Paris. I really need to try the hot chocolate! Has those nice little touches that you won't find anywhere else. Pricey yes, but totally worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great friendly service and a wide variety of products but I've had much better in the city. I was greatly disappointed to learn that the majority of their products are imported and not made in store. I would rather support shops creating from scratch."}
{"text":"You know what? We love this place for it's truly authentic croissants and pastries.   You know why? Because they actually make the bakery items in France and then bake/prepare them here.   You know what else? Ask for extra foam on your cappuccino for a truly European experience.  Not to mention, French-style outdoor seating patio? Don't mind if I do!  We'll be back. Over and over.  Love it."}
{"text":"Oui oui if you're gonna splurge on pastries, teas and hot cocoa then this is place.  All of their pastries are raw shipped from France and freshly baked daily in house.  We've been a few times and I love almost everything I've tried.  They serve sandwiches and soups as well. Where the lost star is coming from is the lack of choice in that area. There's Brie on a croissant or Brie on a baguette or ham on a baguette.  However the pastries, the petite fours, macarons, French flan are to die for.  For end of school year presents they had these cute little boxes of chocolates for the teachers, all within a very reasonable price. Especially if you're getting multiples.  Yes we will go back and back!"}
{"text":"Recently stopped by here to taste their famous \"Angelina's Hot Chocolate\", same one from Paris as stated by the owner. The hot chocolate was very good and tasty!! Different, but good different! It was rich but not too sweet, just the right amount. Had some biscuits, croissants and macarons that were also satisfying. Definitely going back! If you haven't yet, go try the hot chocolate cause it's worth it!"}
{"text":"My sister-in-law was recently in Paris and highly recommended the Angelina's hot chocolate that is available in Toronto's Yonge and Eglinton district at Douce France (along with a zillion other rare French treats in-store). Today we stopped, sat at one of the pretty tables and shared the hot chocolate, following the instructions of the lovely Parisian shopkeeper. You pour the beverage into your teacup, add the fresh whipped cream with a spoon (no stirring), then drink up until you get a creamy moustache. Fun! It's thick and chocolatey but not too sweet, hot but not scorching, and very, very special. A nice change from everyday Tim Horton's or hockey arena hot chocolate. Everyone should try this treat at least once, and help keep this nice little local business ... in business."}
{"text":"What a great dessert place - a solid 3.5 star. The server told us everything they serve is from France. That wasn't a requirement but it was a good visit overall with small misses.  Food: 3/5, the Flan Parisienne (custard pie) was the best thing there. I should've stopped there because that would've guaranteed 4 star at least but I also tried the syrup which really was italian soda but super watered down and the chocolate-almond croissant that was just not good. I know my pastries and it shouldn't be that greasy that - it seemed a little stale to me.  Nevertheless, I will return to try others and get the flan again.  Service: 4/5, super nice lady and the server was great too.  They took time to explain things and it was just great overall.  Ambience: 3/5, a little tight seating and some bugs around; perhaps because of all the sweets.  They may want to close the doors.  Price: 3/5, around $12+ per person which is not too bad for higher end dessert joint."}
{"text":"I always drop by to get a almond croissant. The texture is very good and the sweetness is not overwhelming. You are definitely paying for top quality snacks from France. Their lentil soup is also very good. My favourite shop for desserts and sweets!"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful French pastries and other products.  It is a place to go for a nice fine croissant or pain au chocolat.  However, to sit down and have coffee, it is a small place that is crammed with many products and baked goods.  The service is very friendly, and very...French.  I love going there to buy baked goods and desserts, but not necessarily to sit down and have a coffee."}
{"text":"This shop is lovely! They have delicious croissants and they have recently started selling baguettes! This is a great place to go for a taste of France.  If you ever need to buy chocolates or would like to impress someone when going to dinner I would recommend stopping here!"}
{"text":"Please run to this cute little shop!  Oh my, all the chocolate goodness is here!  And not that crappy chocolate - the owner's brother (who lives in France) makes the chocolates and imports it to her.   The front counter has beautiful macarons, truffles, chocolates..pastries...just about everything to make your heart stop.  And they have Angelina's hot chocolate.  Anyone who has been to Angelina's in Paris knows the decadence of this hot chocolate.  It puts all others to SHAME.  You will feel disgusted trying any others after having this.  This is quite rich so one pot is enough for 3 people.  The smooth velvet chocolate is just simply amazing on so many levels  They do have a small menu - soups, pastries, etc.  There is a combo meal - soup/cheese plate/bread.  A great small meal if you are not too hungry.  Their tea selection is really good and you can really taste the different flavours - they come through so well.    There are many great items to buy here besides the items in the front counter - cookies, jams, sauces.  They all look delicious.   This is a little cafe, so maybe about 20 seats or so....it looks like the inside of a house - a little fireplace, the front area, the shelves, bookcases....such a great place to catch up with friends or just to hang out by yourself"}
{"text":"This is becoming a wonderful weekend ritual: an exceptional cup of Americano and an authentically soft,buttery croissant while I read my books/magazine. Christel, the owner, is warm and welcoming and I love practicing my battered French! She is a patient and gracious hostess. The patio is extremely cramped so be aware if you sit outside.  Inside is a myriad of French, bakery products. Some baked in house from French ingredients, others imported from France.  Do come in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very nice and beautiful Café, delicious French products from the best French artisans and a very helpful and professional shopkeeper! A place to go to enjoy the creamy and hot chocolate Angelina and different selections of French biscuits and sweets such as Canelés de Bordeaux, Palets bretons, biscuits roses de Reims, Calissons d'Aix, etc."}
{"text":"Perfect way to spend a Saturday afternoon. We had the famous Angelina hot chocolate, cafe creme and french treats (fresh and flown in from France)  such as the macaroons and marzipan. The owner is more han happy to share with you how she personally ensures you have a taste and feel of the real France."}
{"text":"French food culture has a certain flair about itself. It's big on flavours and everything must be just so. That culture has stayed true in this lovely shop.   When you walk in you're met with a perfect display of imported French goodies. The Croissants, Tarts, Macarons and other pastries are as good as it gets. All imported from France no less, and the chocolates are some of the best I've tasted. There's also a number of seats and a patio with for you to enjoy a nice sandwich or soup; perhaps a cappuccino or latte? You can't really go wrong with anything here, when it's all made with such care.  This shop really is a little slice of Paris! Just remember to pick up some olives and cookies for the ride home ;)"}
{"text":"Cute Lil French shop selling chocolates, cookies, and sweets imported from France. I tried a variety of their biscuits. The spelt flour chocolate chip one was particularly tasty. Everything looks very pleasant and fancy. It is French after all. Cookies are not the soft chewy kind. Rather they are dense, with slight crunch and a solid bite."}
{"text":"We seem to drop into this sweet little bakery/cafe every time we are in the area.  The quiche is wonderful and the baguette perfectly fluffy and chewy. Every time though, we get caramels from the back of the shop - either in the twisty clear wrappers or the pale blue foil wrappers. Exquisite bundles of happiness.  The chocolate from the showcase is also excellent. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"The few sweets that I tried (lemon tart, caramel candy, fruits bread and truffle) it was really tasty, all fresh and well prepared. They seems to use all the best ingredients for everything they make. The lady was really kind and helpful with us, but a little too pushy, asking us to try different things while we didn't want to. But two things got me a little down with this place: 1- I understand the quality of the products but I think it's a little over priced, too expensive. 2- After choosing the sweets and sitting on the table, it took so much time for them to bring us what we choose to eat. We almost gave up and left.  Would I recommend? Hmmmm, yes. It will be a good place to buy maybe a gift for someone that really appreciate sweets. But not for an usual place to go sit and talk."}
{"text":"The stuff that dreams are made of are contained in Angelina's hot chocolate. Her Choco almond croissants and assortments of other pastries are heavenly as well. Run by a delightful French woman who greets you in French as you walk in, the products are specially flown in from France. You pay a premium for sure, but it's worth it! This is one of the business that make Yonge and Eglinton one of my favourite neighbourhoods in Toronto. So much charm, so much character! A little taste of France in Toronto - this is the real deal folks."}
{"text":"There are some delicious sweets in there for sure, but:  - everything is definitely overpriced. I understand everything is imported from France, because the owner keeps repeating it anytime you look interested in something (she's so overwhelming), but after I paid for my pain au chocolat, I wish I hadn't.. - Staff always look awkward in their suits or in the way they interact with us - some of them (including the owner) talk to you in English, after you just answered them in French... wow. - The concept is nice but they are trying TOO hard.  I come here to get a few things to get a few things I like, because I know them and even though it's pricey, I feel it's okay especially when I feel homesick. So they do get the few people from the French community like me who suck it up and pay the extra. But if they are looking for a wider clientele, they should really try another strategy. The average Canadian that doesn't know about French pastries might feel uncomfortable spending that much on something he doesn't know."}
{"text":"This bakery cafe definitely gets an ooh la la! Simply the best croissants in the city. So what if they're not made locally? They're made in France with French flour and butter. You can't get better than that! Baked fresh every day, so delicious! Their coffee is excellent  and their hot chocolate Angelina is to die for. Also tried their Parisian sandwich made with a real demi-baguette, ham, and brie; simple and good. Inside the cafe you feel transported to France because of the decor and because the staff speaks French. So many goodies to try! I will have to come back. Merci!!"}
{"text":"I first went into the store a few months ago, but forgot to write a review.  I'm a fan of European pastries!  I've been to Paris and have eaten the real deal too.  :P  Upon entering, I wasn't impressed because the food was pre-packaged and not made fresh, but the service was impeccably professional by both the owner and guy dressed in a black and white waiter outfit.  I got a nice little tour from the owner of the different French regional dessert tables.  I initially popped in while walking by just to look, but I couldn't refuse.  I ordered the combo with the big bowl of Angelina hot chocolate served with whipped cream and raspberries and it was 10/10!!!!  She was correct when she warned me that the big mug of hot chocolate would be too big so after awhile I was too full to enjoy the rest and forced it down.  It came with a couple of cookies and macaroon.  My favourite was the Fossier brand Champagne biscuit!  I also detest macaroons, but she assured me it's not sweet like how they're normally made in Canada, which was correct.  The prices are okay, but I do feel they're slightly more considering they're not made on the premises, but I guess it offsets the shipping.  My only disappointment was that after I ordered, I asked takeout everything, but was told that her license only allows Angelina to be enjoyed dining in.  It was okay I guess.  I was walking home in the rain, but was dry in my rain boots, but would have preferred to enjoy it in front of my t.v.  I returned about a month later to buy a box of the Fossier brand Champagne biscuits!  :)  I will return for Angelina with friends!  :)"}
{"text":"I came across this cafe on my way to look for a study spot. While it was unfortunate that their place wasn't conducive for long-term studying, I came back to check them out. I tried the chocolate and almond croissant (as per the staff's recommendation) and while they looked kind of squished, they were very good. I imagined they would have tasted better if I had toasted them a bit before eating. I also had the Parisian Flan, which to me had the taste of creme brulee but slightly more set in texture? It was also very good and the size is good to share between two or three (as a dessert). Like some of the other reviews have mentioned, this shop is a bit pricy for an everyday thing but a splurge every once in a while would be ok :D"}
{"text":"Other reviewers are right that this place is very expensive, especially for the packaged goods, but they are unique and imported so you get what you pay for.  The pastries are a little expensive but not too bad. The croissant was mediocre - I've had a lot better in Toronto. However the Kouign-Amann was to die for. I'd go back just for this. The canelés had a great flavor but were too spongy and dry for me to give them full stars.  I give this a four because I'll likely return and there are some winners here. Plus I love the friendly staff, French music playing inside, and unique finds here. I haven't seen another place like this."}
{"text":"This place is my cheat day ritual. I go here and treat myself to the amazing hot chocolate. It's like nothing you've ever tried before. I get intensive cravings in winter months, there were even instances that I took the subway and came here just to have my favourite drink in the world."}
{"text":"Didn't know the store is so close to my place and finally went to there for pastries take out. Love the different flavor croissants I purchased. Basically if you get 6 pastries it's tax free.  The next day I ate some of them and they were still super delicious.  Will go back soon :P"}
{"text":"Ever want to try and see what the French gets to enjoy every hour and every day?  Douce France goes out annually to France and brings back only the best to share with us frozen Canadians.  They're actually there now till the end of February sourcing their 2018 items to let us try and nibble.  A small little quaint and rustic cafe just north of the busy intersection of Yonge & Eg.  It looks more like a retail store but you can definitely sit among the shelves to enjoy a piece of Paris.  The staff here is lead by a lovely lady who has the most wonderful crisp French Parisienne accent.  She was very thoughtful to explain all the different treats that I've never heard of ... including the Soleil (yeah how could I resist.. blueberry or raspberry gelee and wrapped in marzipan).    Here you can find many wonderful things that could be amazing host gifts or just a day to indulge in all the best butter and sugar confections.  This also include the very famous and well known Angelina Hot Chocolate.  As you go further back, youll find a few more savoury options including sauces and preserved vegetables.  Just be aware on a few things... it's not cheap and barely affordable.  A simple bag of candies can easily set you back $18 (My Soleils did!).  That being said, you can find some gems here that are not only wonderful but wallet friendly.  Kouignamann were here too and I would have loved to try the Brittany treat but ... I decided on the Soleils and Canele.  Canele - One of my favourite baked treats from France.  This is simple ingredients transformed into something absolutely wonderful.  They're baked in bronze casts that allows the sugar to create a wonderful dark caramelized crust that is crispy and gives a nice crunch when biting into it.  The flavour should be a rich vanilla and rum scent throughout and saturating the eggy airy custard inside.  The texture would be like a super fresh steamed Vietnamese rice cake...  a bouncy and lovely chew to it.  The ones from Douce France are not quite there... the flavour profile and colour are all there.  It's just the wrong texture.  It was soft and doughy throughout the exterior and interior.  That being said, the price was very favourable...  Only $1.10 for a medium sized one.  For the best Canele, try Blackbird or Roselle... both sell out consistently for good reason.  4/5  Is it for an every day trip.. probably not.  I would even say that it's not even weekly.  It can put a serious dent into your wallet but what a joy to find the occasional gem that gives you a bit of taste of France."}
{"text":"An interesting place... everything comes from France and tastes pretty good, although i would still prefer them to make breads and croissants fresh themselves, rather than cooking frozen ones... it always tastes a litttle bit different. If around i may go again, but not on my list of places i want to go even if they are far from home."}
{"text":"I recall reading about Douce France a while ago, not necessarily for their croissants, but for their chocolates.  But within that article I recalled that Douce France made croissants too.  So while I was running errands in the area, I made the hubby go in and pick up some croissants to try.  These croissants were amazing!  Light and flakey and full of buttery goodness!  I'm pretty sure that it partly had to do with them being fresh from the oven as well.    I wish that I lived closer so I could eat these croissants whenever I wanted.  But I'm sure my pants love that I live that far away."}
{"text":"A visit to Douce France is like a trip to a pastry shop/cafe in Paris without the attitude.  Here everything is import from France fresh every week. To name a few:  Compagnie Coloniale  the oldest French tea brand established in 1848 -  http://www.compagnie-coloniale.com/en/index.html  Voisin Chocolate -  http://www.chocolat-voisin.com/chocolats/  (Gluten Free)  Madeleines - Made by Mireille Faucher from Bearn http://www.coeurdebearn.com/deguster-restaurants-et-produits/produits-du-terroir-et-accueil-a/Biscuiterie-Mireille-Faucher  Gingerbread from The House of Mulot & Petitjean in Dijon http://www.mulotpetitjean.fr/flashsite_en/  And of course Angelina's hot chocolate ($8.90) http://www.angelina-paris.fr/en/ without the line up and crowd!  We ended up sharing a pot of hot tea with blend from Compagnie Coloniale - Boudoir® (Assam, Darjeeling and Ceylon with a note of bergamot) while enjoying our order of Madeleines and Caneles de Bordeaux. (Even the Caneles is the real deal!)  The owner here is just so sweet and accommodating!   I will be back for my Angelina's hot chocolate, soon! Until my next trip to Paris!"}
{"text":"We went by for some brunch on a Sunday and had the pre set snack for $25. It came with a croissant cut in half, 2 chocolates, 2 halves of a candied orange, 4 small savoury cookies, 4 small sweet cookies and 3 small cubes of cheese along with blueberry jam.  I had a tea and my wife had a coffee. It was really good and the place is quite nice and comfortable.  To go: some flan and 3 Florentines   The final bill was $56.27 and after tip $64.71  I would go back again. If you can get past the price, the quality and service is excellent. Everything is actually imported from France so if that is important to you, this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to get fresh macaroons! A little pricey...but worth it due to the authenticity and quality. Definitely recommend this shop and will be visiting again to sit and try the pastries and coffee!"}
