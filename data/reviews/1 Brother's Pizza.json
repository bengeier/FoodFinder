{"text":"Amazing Lunch Specials! I got 2 slices of pizza and a drink for around 5 bucks. I've gone here for quite some time and the food never disappoints!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero star rating, I would. Horrible service from this place with sub standard quality food. The owner Gary is a joke so it's no wonder that the rest of his staff has no understanding of guest service. Don't waste your money here!!! Several other options are available nearby with far superior service and food quality."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. Should have gone someplace else. Order a XL pepperoni pizza. The bottom of the crust was really tough and the whole pizza was really bland. Even my kids did not like it. Threw half the pizza out, just could eat it and did not want it as leftovers. Made myself something else afterwards just to get the taste out of my mouth.

Also, don't expect the pizza, wings or breadsticks in the pictures from their website. They took those from the papa johns website. They can't even take there own pictures."}
{"text":"This place was great! Nice atmosphere, clean, good people! In the lunch special deal can't be beak right around $6 for two slices of pizza and a drink! All fresh ingredients good bread and sauce. Check it out it's cool."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place! Pizza was great and we weren't waiting forever. Customer service was excellent as well! Everything was very clean overall great gIt's a great place to eat dinner with the kids!"}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE!!! Don't waste your time or money!!! Their prices are reasonable, so that's no reason to go! The food wasn't bad, it's all about the experience!!!

My family and I ordered a pizza and waters! We are the ONLY ones in the place. There are 2 guys behind the counter. We sit down and my daughter is looking around for parmasean cheese. All the containers she finds and MAYBE 1/4 full. We get our food. There are 4 of us and the pizza is cut into 6 slices....hhhmmm mathematically that doesn't work out!!!:-( We go to add some parmesean cheese to a slice and the cheese dumps onto our food. The cap was not screwed down.

The entire time we are there, we are the only ones. Towards the end, we see a couple come in to place an order. The guy who looks like the owner, is scratching his ear while taking the order. EEWWWW!!!!!! 

Never once do the 2 guys behind the counter ever bother to provide any customer service and check on our food or our dining experience. 

I used to own a pizzeria and customer was KING. Here, we were just a group that gave this guy something to do and appeared to have little or no value to him. 

The only reason for the 1 star is because the place is not too shabby inside. The pizza was not bad either... tastier than Sardellas...although their customer service ROCKS by comparison!!!"}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this location for over a year and I will never give them my business again after tonight. I ordered for delivery, which I do every time. 30 minutes later, the establishment calls to verify my address before the delivery driver heads out. Another 30 minutes later, and the delivery driver calls me to tell me he is lost. Do we not provide GPS to the drivers? I give him directions and we hang up. 30 MINUTES LATER I have to call the driver and ask what the deal is? He is now lost again-this time 15 minutes further away than where he was the first call! How does this even happen!? To top it off, the driver got very aggravated  with me on the phone because he can't do his job. I ask him to take the order back that has now been sitting in his car for over an hour and call the restaurant back. I ask for a refund, which the man on the phone says he can not do until he has the receipt from the driver. He promises to call me back once the driver returns with the receipt. 90 MINUTES LATER I still don't have a phone call back from the restaurant-so I call them. \"Sorry, we got busy\" was the only reason they had for not processing my refund or giving me a call. I have asked the owner by the name of Gary to call me back. We will see if this happens. Never have I had a restaurant or any type of establishment get upset with me for wanting to give them my business!! Looks like we will be looking for a new Friday night family pizza place!"}
{"text":"The wings are delicious. If you can get past the douche bag workers there, the food is delicious. And on Cardinal games, they aren't busy... so it works perfect."}
{"text":"We went in one night for dinner.  We got the large pizza and wings special with four sodas.  The staff were kind.  In fact (I believe the owner) said, \"you know it would be cheaper for you to get a pitcher of soda versus four individuals.\"  I thought that was great they told us that.  The pizza came out with the wings I would say 15-20 minutes.  We were asked if we needed anything.  The pizza was hot and had good flavor.  The chicken wings though were AMAZING.  Some of the best we've had in a long time.  Would like to see more of a variety of specials....We've been back twice since our first visit."}
{"text":"Just love this place. The staff is just sweet as can be. Lily is the best !!! We drive from Ahwatukee to get their pizza."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza!!! It is so yummy!! The only reason I gave it four stars is because delivery takes forever so we always pick it up."}
{"text":"I have loved this place ever since it opened! The staff is so incredibly friendly and nice. The owners are the absolute best!!!! Their food is really good and they have the greatest prices."}
{"text":"The pizza and service sucks here The cheese has no flaver and the pizza sauce reminds me somthing that you get out of a can and the crust was tough and reminded me of store bought..... The staff were unhelpfull and rude. The crzyiest thing was when were were going to take our left over pizza home the took our left overs and put them in a fricking paper bag yea a bag not a pizza box. I could only laugh and ask them \"wow  you trying to save money on not using pizza boxes??? AS we walked out the bag was sucking up the grease i just left it by there door. I was so pist don't go there frozen pizza is better."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but will come again when I'm in the area.  The service was super friendly, and pretty quick (though it was a little after the normal lunch rush time).  Wings were tasty.  I didn't have the pizza, but the table next to me did and I overheard them commenting approvingly.  Sure smelled great (maybe I should have traded a couple wings for a slice)."}
{"text":"We moved nearby and revived a coupon in the mail so figured we'd give it a try.

The coupon CLEARLY says 2-XL cheese pizza w/ one topping for $22.00. (Sooo.. $11.00/pizza). There is also an additional coupon that says 1 XL cheese pizza,$9.00 .. additional toppings $2.00. Ok.. so for those of us good at math- a cheese with 1 topping still equals $11.00.. follow?;)

We order for delivery ( coupon does not have restrictions)... I ask the price and she says \" about 29$..\" (they have a $3.00 delivery fee)...ok.. nothing is \"about\" when I'm handing you a credit card. She goes back and forth for five minutes arguing that toppings cost $2.00. I keep politely explaining the coupon. Finally she says ..\"ok about $26.00.\"

About?! Ok I'm hungry- being the food.

Great! We order both pizzas thin crust.

Pizza arrives and the bill is $30.00. We tip the driver - not his fault.

Call the restaurant and get told AGAIN that toppings are $2.00. The girl (same girl I ordered from) quoted me a price ., then up charged to the price she wanted!!! No no no. 

I said I'd be happy to take a picture of the coupon. Argue argue.. they finally reduce the credit card charge but there's confusion bc we left tip. Really annoying. 

Also- pizzas came pan style, not thin. Really thick , dense crust. Not super yum. Not a lot of flavor in the crust. Less than average pizza. 

I'd be ok with the quality of their food ($22 for 2 XL is great for feeding a bunch of people!) but to have a  staff member just charge whatever she felt like after she told me they'd honor their own coupon is crazy. 

Disappointing. I'll post the coupon image."}
{"text":"Place has been here for years, tried for the first time today.   The place was empty at lunch time (not a good sign).  Lady who took my order rang me up wrong. Guy gave me plain cheese slice instead of pepperoni and when lady brought me my food, i had to ask where my drink was. 
Pizza was fine for what i paid, a simple slice for lunch.  Wings were tiny, spicy but tasty. 
Inexpensive food, poor service."}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza for pick up. They gave us OLD pizza. Must have been sitting for at least an hour. Awful terrible pizza!!! Called to complain. They could care less. Last time I get pizza from them.

They should be embarrassed!"}
{"text":"Good NY style Sicilian Pizza, the wings are very small, but the price reflects that, I've been going here since it opened, it's a different experience, food & service when the older gentlemen is not working, he may be the owner, think I'll make sure he's working before we go again in the evening. 
That large antipasto salad is really good for the price of 6.00, we split it & still bring some home."}
{"text":"I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would. Ordered their dinner special, was told it would be 45 minutes. 1.5 hours later we still had no pizza. Called and spoke to their manager, Alex, who couldn't give us a time when it would be delivered. When asked if they could call the driver, hung up on. Called back, was then told another 15 minutes. Asked to have it all cancelled because almost 2 hours for pizza (1 cheese xl pizza and 25 wings), being hung up on, laughed at and lied to,  is out of this world. So, they don't relay it to the driver and he shows up to our house and we tell him he can leave, we already said we didn't want it. The driver says to us \"I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE\". We call back to of course file a complaint and we get the runaround and laughed at. I cannot fathom why a business like this is even still around. The owner, Gary, doesn't give a sh*t about how his employees treat customers."}
{"text":"This is my go-to pizza.  I feel like Norm when I walk in the door, they know my name!  Never once had a bad pie, this little shop is the only restaurant in my speed dial.  The sauce is my favorite part...something in it stands out...extra basil?  It's addictive.

The only sad part is in my recent attempts to cut way back on carbs, I'm crying a little inside over not having a weekly pizza.  It's less frequent but I love this place still.  If there was any place to improve, it's the size of the wings.  At times they can be scrawny.

Lately, they have honored my request to use smaller dough to make me a pizza- ultra-thin crust.  Helps cut back some of those carbs because a gluten-free pizza is just out of the question- that ain't even pizza...but I digress.

Not too long ago, I noticed and even tried the delivery.  Right up to par there too.  These are good people, folks."}
{"text":"Disagree with some of the other reviews. I have had very good pizzas with fresh ingredients and great crust.   Wings are the best in the area - not all fatty like the other chain pizza places on the corner such as Barros and Papa Johns. 

Greek salad was large, fresh and good."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly had lunch here today. The calzones were awesome. The crust was amazing. My sister and I were very pleasantly surprised at how delicious these were. My only complaint was there was slightly too much ricotta cheese in one place in the calzone. Otherwise it was fast and delicious. Would definitely return"}
{"text":"I had a good takeout experience with this outfit. Good coupon, good pizza & good wings !   $22 ......decent value."}
