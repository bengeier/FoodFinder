{"text":"If you're in the area and only have 4 bucks I would recommend it. As a far as the sandwiches go they are a solid meh. They are quick and  cheap but otherwise nothing to write home about. I eat them because I'm in the area.  If you're looking for good banh mii I would recommend visiting places in Chinatown or banh mii boys."}
{"text":"I eat Viet food at least once a week and have eaten many, many banh mi (Vietnamese subs) all over Toronto. I can name about 100 places that make better banh mi than this place.   Besides the miserable look on the faces of everyone working in the place, I have never seen such little food put into a sandwich before. The bread tasted stale and there was two small pieces of actual BBQ Pork in the whole sandwich. I even took a picture of this sorry sandwich to show people how terrible it was.  If you want good banh mi, head to one of the Viet places in Chinatown. Avoid this sorry place at all costs. Miserable people and disgusting food deserves zero stars from me."}
{"text":"I was going to a workshop and needed to get a quick bite and noticed this place. Banh mi usually equates to good cheap eats. Yes, it's more expensive than other banh mi places $4 instead of $3. But viet subs are undervalued as a whole compared to $10 not so fresh fast food meals. I was a bit worried about the quality of the sandwich because it was so quiet when I walked in. Very used to the bustle of other banh mi places in busier areas where tons are made at a time. Anyway, the sandwich was good! The baguette was long and narrow compare to wider bread at popular banh mi places. Tasted like all the other assorted banh mi s I've had."}
{"text":"Good banh mi, I like their long and narrow bagette. I hate the big kind, it's so hard to bite and food spill out everywhere. This place is very small. Parking is hard to find in this area. 4 stars because their banh mi is more expensive than other places but still a lot cheaper than subway and tastier. Give this place a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Looking for the best food you'll find for under $3 after tax?  This place is definitely worth a try. Its not ground breaking stuff, but its good food at good prices and there really isn't much else in the Dufferin & College area when looking for a quick bite to eat on the go.  The bbq pork banh mi is better than the assorted bahn mi, and personally I hold off on the coriander when ordering. I believe they also offer chicken breast or beef sandwiches at higher prices, but I've yet to try them as I'm big on pork.  The place is also stocked with tons of take home instant soups and chinese grocery items that have a long shelf life, so don't be afraid to browse while your sandwich is being made as you'll probably come across something cool worth buying."}
{"text":"$3.99 for a 6inch at Subway? Nah...I can get a better sub at Le's sandwich for $2.50  I have always loved Vietnamese subs; the fresh bun, the use of corriander, assorted meat, and the yummy pickled vegetables. soooo good.  FOOD Apparently this is the best sub place in Toronto according to my friend. I dont' know about the best. It was alright and I would definitely go there again.  It just wasn't KaBAM WoW! Same ingredients as a typical viet restaurant.  COST It was a bit more than the sandwiches in Spadina. Le's cost was $2.50 whereas Spadina (from the last time I've been there...which was probably a year ago) is $2.25. So there is a slight premium. but only so slight."}
{"text":"Big cheap fresh sandwich. Bread is a little too dry. Meats are so tasty but doesn't look well refrigerated so make sure u eat that sandwich right away leaving it out might give u the runs -.-"}
{"text":"Starving? 3 bucks on ya? Go here. Of course, anything is good when your starving.   Its not fantastic; I got a rotisserie chicken sandwich, which didn't taste anything like rotisserie chicken. Than there were a couple carrots on it served on a French stick.   It's also convenient if you live close by, and you need some instant noodles,   Moreover, it's good for a quick bite to eat."}
