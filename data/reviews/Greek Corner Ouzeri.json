{"text":"I used to live a block away from this place.  It is so good. It is actually two restaurants. \"Greek Corner\" is a casual, quick service, basic greek food place. And \"Ouzeri\" is the sit down restaurant next door.  They share a kitchen but have completely different atmospheres and menus.  \"Ouzeri\"   The only reason that I have not been back is because my husband hates it.   Not because of the food, but because some old man harassed me in the parking lot.  The food was perfect and the restaurant itself is not responsible for the dirtbags in the communal parking lot.   The service was great. Our server was a girl, probably sixteen or seventeen. Very friendly and kind.  The decor was really pretty. Everything was white with blue.  The back corner had some little couches to sit on if you just want to get drinks with friends.  They also do late night entertainment with greek music and things.  My husband got the Garides Saganak (shrimp, capers, feta, in a tomato sauce). I got the Oktapodi (grilled octopus).  Both dishes were very reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.  The octopus was not overcooked but perfectly chewy and very flavorful. They also brought us some incredible house made bread and we ordered the dip sampler with hummus, skordalia (potato dip),  and taramosalata (creamy caviar dip).  This came with pita.  My husband liked the hummus and I loved the caviar dip.  It was savory and briney.  Everything here was great.  I'm sure I will be back.  We probably would have made this a regular place if my husband wasn't so ticked off by the dirtbag in the parking lot. The food was delicious. The service was excellent. Prices were fair. Decor was beautiful.  \"Greek Corner\"  Despite being five feet away from Ouzeri, my husband does not harbor the same grudge here.  We ate here pretty regularly when we lived close by.  He would usually get the gyro and I would get hummus.  Both were delicious.  Service was friendly and quick.  The hummus would usually last me a few days (get extra pita).  They have a cold case with desserts.  I've gotten the baklava a few times--excellent."}
{"text":"This place is not good!!! Their portions are very small, and they frequently run out of items that are on the menu, particularly their desserts. Also, their prices are very high for what you get, especially the octopus, which was pretty ridiculous. The interior of the restaurant is very small and uninviting, and it is attached to the fast food gyro place next door, which is really kind of weird even though they probably have the same owner. You're much better off just getting a gyro next door than you are eating here, because their gyros are actually really good, and the prices are much more reasonable."}
{"text":"Get the saganaki and don't forget to \"Opa!\" There's no wrong order but I personally love the dolmades, Greek meatballs, psiti and baklava.  Update: new owners, lots of menu changes that I'm pretty sad about. Especially disappointed in the new version of baklava... it was limp, not flaky or crisp and tasted like fake honey. I love Greek food so I'm not giving up on this place. Hopefully they will improve with experience."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for her 20th Birthday and I was feeling very nostalgic for my Greek heritage.  This quaint little restaurant was perfect!   We loved the atmosphere,  the live music with Dimitri,  and the greatest waiter ever, Richie.  We ordered an array of appetizers which included Tzatziki Sauce, Calamari,  Grilled Octopus,  and Saganaki.  Everything tasted perfectly Greek.   We can't wait to go back even though we live 2 1/2 hours away!! You'll see us soon at The Greek Ouzeri!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant! I love coming here to either get a quick gyro or a wonderful dinner with my friends. The food is so amazing and the staff is friendly. I recommend getting a bunch of plates to share... especially the saganaki (Opa!), dolmades and greek meatballs.  The one thing this place has to improve on is its music. It makes sense that there is greek music in a greek restaurant, but it's almost always unreasonably loud... especially when there is a live band."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of five on recommendation of one in our party and her knowledge of my love of greek food. At first I looked it up on line and actually got the take out next doors menu. I went in thinking ok run of the mill same old same old choices. Very much surprised when we got the menu.   We ordered 5 appetizers, a bottle of wine, and 5 entrees and the bill was just at $100.00. I was just in a greek place in San jose California last week and spent double this for 4 without a bottle of wine and only 2 appetizers.  Food is very good, first time in a year I was able to get grilled octopus, last time was in Greece. This was very flavorful, a bit tougher than in Greece but I'm sure this was frozen and on the greek islands its fresh off boat daily. Still very good. Lamb chop special good, calamari dish very tender and flavorful. Souvlaki tender and tasty, as well as shrimp.  I saw other tables with authentic Greek beers, fully stocked bar.   Live music a bit loud but very nice, service is impeccable. Decor very nice. Give this place a try and don't be put off by location in strip mall."}
{"text":"My husband and I were invited to come here by a greek friend of ours on a Saturday night. The food good. We had ordered all types of appetizers and a huge platter of rice and assorted meats as we had a big group. It was fun to take part in the greek dancing and listening to the live music. My only complaint was that the music was just too loud. It's a somewhat small space and my ears were ringing by the time we left. I would've preferred it more if we could have had dinner prior to the music starting and THEN enjoy the music and dancing."}
{"text":"Husband and I came for a celebration of our anniversary. The menu has pretty much all the Greek dishes you would want to taste. We started with the grilled octopus seasoned with lemon, dill and capers served over raw red onions. It was grilled to perfection and seasoned well. Enough for two people. My husband ordered the pork gyro which came with tzatziki dip, tomatoes and pita bread with raw red onions. It would have been nice if they would have  included a side Greek salad. I ordered the fresh whole  tripoura fish which was grilled. The fish was basted with Greek herbs and spices lemon juice and it was delicious. Our waitress Lisa, was very friendly and helpful in our menu choices. Lisa was gracious and treated us to a delicious baklava warmed up and drizzled with chocolate sauce for celebrating our anniversary. We finished it off with Greek coffee and galactoboureko. On Fridays and first Saturday of the month they have live Greek music. Not this night though. All in all, I would recommend this place again and we will have to come back to enjoy the live  Greek music. OPA!"}
