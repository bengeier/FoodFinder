{"text":"I've been coming to Govinda's for about 13 years now - in my opinion it is one of Toronto's best kept secrets for really delicious Indian food! 

The portions are beyond generous - I've never once come away hungry when eating there. I would never in my life call their food bland like some other review mentioned. No they don't use garlic and onions, but they use hing (a spice that has the same sort of savory taste profile as onions and garlic), and plenty of other spices and curries, so the food is extremely flavorful and tasty!  And the staff is always very warm and welcoming. If you go there enough for them to recognize you, it gets really lovely as they get so happy to see you back, and you feel like it's really \"your place\". And you absolutely cannot beat the price.

In the past few years they have renovated the dining room, and it's absolutely stunning inside now! The dramatic vaulted ceilings create a real sense of grandeur, and the authentic and large, beautiful Hindu statuary and tapestries are as gorgeous as they are fascinating to get up close and really take a good look at. Most of the time there is gentle Indian music playing, though sometimes it may not be - either way, the natural light that comes in from the skylights is lovely during the day, and at night the low lighting makes for a really intimate and relaxing feel.

Yes, this restaurant is inside the Hare Krishna temple, but it's in a completely separate section of the building, and it's never something that comes up if you're there to eat. In fact, I think it's a really cool element - how often do you get to visit a real temple AND get an flipping awesome meal on the cheap? If you have no interest in the temple part, then you simply stick to the restaurant room. But if you like to catch a bit of culture, you're free to pop into the temple-space and look around before or after your meal, and if you have any questions one of the staff there is always happy to answer them.

I couldn't find anything to complain about if I tried. Like I said, I've been going there for 13 years. I found the place when I was in university, fell in love, and have been going back - dare I say, religiously - ever since!"}
{"text":"This place offer very simple basic dishes. Do not expect the flavour to be bombastic or comparable to regular restaurants. If you have eaten too much seasoned and marinated food and wants a break, this is a place to be. It's mostly quiet and serene place from your usual husselling and bustling dining experience. For $2 you get a big glass of mango juice."}
{"text":"Love this place. Very tasty vegetarian, top quality and inexpensive. Too bad hours are limited."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Friendly staff and calming atmosphere.  I recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I got two words for this wonderful Restaurant \"Divine Dining\"!"}
{"text":"the friendly service is what I really liked!! the people who work there were very friendly and welcoming
as a vegetarian who loves indian food, I was in heaven... I'm thinking of going vegan soon though and I noticed that although everything was delicious and made with lots of veggies, many things had either ghee or paneer (I think) which is cheese 
anyway, my favourite were the kafta (?) balls!  which tasted like balls of cheesy chickpea goodness, sooo good, and the dhal, which is like a thick lentil soup! AND ALL FOR 8 BUCKS if you're a poor student like me that's the best news youve heard all day 
highly recommend! 
oh and the decor and music is really nice too :)"}
{"text":"I've lived in this neighbourhood my whole life and love this spot. The price is great for the wonderful quality of veggie buffet and it's a non-profit. The staff, who are all volunteers, are always lovely and attentive. If you're cool with a small spread of delicious food, huge portions, good prices and lovely people then this is a great spot. If you're looking for a vast menu with tons of options and have a more limited diet, perhaps not for you.  We love it!"}
{"text":"Govinda's is the vegetarian restaurant in the Hare Krishna temple. The food is Indian but they don't use garlic or onions, so it's a bit bland. The price is actually a donation. The last time I went there it was $7. The volunteer working there pushed the food around on the plate with his fingers a bit, which I didn't like so much. Every so often there is a jingling sort of chant that comes over the PA system. It's an interesting experience, but the food isn't that great and the atmosphere a bit weird."}
{"text":"We did not know about this place until it popped up on Groupon and we decided to go since the food price was insanely cheap. We got a deal for 4 people for around $30 total (their regular price is $10 per person which is sill very cheap).
This place is located inside an Indian temple. It is extremely peaceful there. We went on a Monday evening and there were only two people other than us sitting there.
The server was a nice gentleman who told us that all the food is made by temple volunteers. There is no set menu - it changes on a daily basis. He explained the food options to us: everything was vegan except for a paneer dish that was vegetarian. 
The food was lovely! I would buy it even if the price was higher. We got to try all the options they had that day (a salad to start, lentil soup, vegetarian \"meat\" balls in tomato sauce, basmati rice, deep fried vegetables and many other delicious dishes). The place felt cozy and staff was welcoming. I should have taken a photo of the food when I was there but you have no patience when you are starving...
I am surprised that I had not heard about this place until now! We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Very simple basic dishes, mediocre taste and very limited selection. Bought $10 for 2 from Groupon. Pretty cheap but you definitely get what your pay for. 

It's actually located in a temple so depending on how comfortable you are eating there it could feel like a totally amazing experience or just uncomfortable. 

In the summer it's incredibly hot as there is no aircondition.

It's also a non for profit organization and everyone is a volunteer there."}
{"text":"Simply best Indian vegetarian restaurant in Toronto with elegant ambience and meditative atmosphere. I love to go there often.
Food is really yummy starting you with soup and salad, then main course and ending with Dessert.
It's worth your every penny, time and taste buds and I guess the best value for money you will ever find in Toronto."}
{"text":"Located inside the temple. The dining area itself is in a large hall, with food being served from one of the corners.

For $10, you get a soup and salad, a plate of food, and a dessert.

The options vary day-to-day, sort of like a canteen. You basically get what they felt like making that day, so things may be different everytime.

It's quite a lot of food for what you're paying for, since you get the full 3-courses.
I don't know about the taste since I don't visit too many indian places, but I found it pretty tasty although there's no meat. Has various sauces and spices in everything.

This probably isn't really a restaurant but part of the temple operations for the people that spend their days there, so don't be surprised with how it works. I don't expect it to operate like a commercial restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here on  Groupon, but their prices are soooooo cheap you don't need to wait for that special deal.
It's a non for profit located in a temple. It has a very quite atmosphere that you'd expect temples to have.
The buffet is served to you as many times as you wish and they have a variety of desserts (chickpea flour cookies!!!) and drinks (tamarind juice is an interesting choice but very strong in taste).
I'd definitely come here again esp when I feel like saving money and eating a good Indian food."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant, which is inside the ISKCON temple of Toronto after our son's Convocation ceremony on 8th June 2016 in the evening, along with the Dharamshi family. We took a $10 vege buffet, which was really good, starting with Salad, then the main course and we took a dessert of Dates and dry fruit crushed round piece very tasty, included in buffet. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"It's like if you took Chipotle, made it Indian and added unlimited refills of everything and threw in bonus soup, salad, and desert. They're probably making nothing in terms of profit because the food quality is so high and so delicious. Interior looks like an Indian temple. 10/10 and two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Look for deals on Wagjag or Groupon they always have deals for this place. We got 2 lunch buffets for $10. That's $5 for a buffet. It was in a cool building i think it use to be a church. There wasn't a big selection but worth what we paid. Not sure if i would pay full price for this place. The food was decent, only a couple dishes did we love."}
{"text":"Went there on a groupon deal ($10 for 2 people for lunch or dinner buffet). You get a bowl of soup and a small plate of salad and two times at the buffet (someone puts the food for you on a plate to monitor portion control) and one dessert (non Indian). 

I found the food to be incredibly salty and very bland - very little variety. The place is in some sort of church, and the actual restaurant is in a room with really high ceilings but it was dark and a little dingy. The people were nice, but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend it. The experience was a bit weird for me."}
{"text":"Bought $10 for 2 from Groupon. Pretty cheap. You get for what your pay for. Keep in mind it's non for profit organization. A temple. 

If it's a hot day, then don't even bother going in there. There is no AC or FAN. You will sweat like a pig in there. 
Servers are volunteers and they are amazing. Food not so much. It's blant. I recommend stay away from this place...however I recommend helping the organization."}
{"text":"Nothing impressive. Mediocre food. Usually Iskcon restaurants are very good. This one didn't meet expectations. Just because this restaurant is in the temple, it can't be reviewed as great food. They could do better. The people serving were nice and the place itself was spacious and clean."}
{"text":"Went again yesterday...originally found it during Doors Open and was very pleased and surprised with the ambiance, food, service and quantity.  I purchased a groupon....took my nephew who is super picky.  Loved the salad, soup and cold mango juice.  Then, had a huge serving of vegan Indian food.  Delish!  They were very attentive and even said we could go back for more...but we were unable to finish.  Then, desert.  We had the vegan option of a date/nut/coconut ball...have purchased these separately at other places for 3 - 4 $.  We will be going back regularly."}
{"text":"Food was cheap but not great. The meal starts with soup and salad, and then unlimited amounts of some of the foods at the hot table. One dessert is also included.

Found the process a bit confusing and the servers seemed equally as confused."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience. I loved the service, and the concept behind it. The food however, was okay. I've had better. As a naturalized Canadian of Indian background (I've grown up here for the majority of my life), I appreciate that the food wasn't too spicy as most Indian food is. However, the lack of salt made it bland. We had rice, dal, vegetables, spinach with potatoes, a paneer stuffed empanada thing, roti, and onion pakoras. Salad and a cupcake rounded the meal. The menu changes daily. I didn't think much of the food and was glad I went with a groupon. Even after just a small sample of everything, I wasn't able to have seconds, which made me skeptical of how the food was prepared. The service, on the other hand, was absolutely outstanding. The servers were both really sweet. My only complaint about the ambiance was that the music was a tad loud, and subsequently, I couldn't hear when I tried to have a conversation."}
{"text":"This was a unique experience. I've never gotten lunch from inside of a Hare Krishna Temple before, safe to say. 

Dim lighting, nicely made-up tables, soft Indian music. Kind of a funky atmosphere. I liked it.

Got the dish to go, $10 all in, pretty generous amount, lots of variety, nice taste, pretty fresh. Really enjoyed the date balls for dessert. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian by any means, but I still respect the food and the ethos behind it.

All in all, I enjoyed it. Will be back for sure, maybe I'll try eating in next time and soak up more of the atmosphere. 

I don't know how they make any money though, it wasn't very busy and it's pretty cheap and there is no alcohol obviously to help pad the bottom line.

Hope they make it, I'd like to come regularly!"}
{"text":"I went here with a groupon but it was cheap anyway.
the food was mediocre..nothing fancy... finally a place that served not only main course, but also salad and dessert."}
