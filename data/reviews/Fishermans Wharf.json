{"text":"I LOVE seafood and was really looking forward to try this place out for summerlicious. I was super duper excited and even picked out what I was going to order beforehand. 

Appetizer- lobster bisque- it was alright, not really flavourful, just as Nicole mention below the lobster bisque was full of small cracked shells and I kept having to spit it out. 

Main - lobster linguine - omg was SO disappointed! The linguine had absolutely NO TASTE to it at all despite the waiter adding peppers and cheese to it. I had to put in some tobasco to make it some what edible  lobster tail itself was alright, nothing too special about it but I wouldn't order it again. 

Dessert- creme brûlée - the best plate of the night yet it's still not THAT great. Or should I rephrase it and say the only acceptable fish of the night. tasted just like any other creme brûlée you get from other restaurants except this one is super sweet. I only had half of it and couldn't take it anymore. 

The service was alright, they never came and asked how the meal was. There was only ONE waiter for the whole restaurant but luckily when I was there the place was somewhat quiet so he could still manage it. Food came out very fast almost as if it was pre-made. With the price for summerlicious ($35) it is totally NOT worth it, I rather pay a bit more and go to canoe for a way better dinner. I got fooled by the menu, it looked really good because I love seafood as mentioned earlier so I decided to give it a try. I didn't Yelp the place before deciding to go, if I have yelped it I probably would not have went because of all the negatives reviews there. SO if you are reading this and trying to decide whether to give it a try...I strongly suggest NO! Just use the money and go somewhere more worth it."}
{"text":"We came from out of town to support Winterlicious 2016 and we are leaving this city with a bad taste in our mouth, literally. We are so disappointed about this restaurant and the lack of quality they put into their food and experience. 

I ordered a Caesar salad which had old lettuce going bad and stale croutons. A steak which was sent back three times. The first cut through, it was much too rare for my medium rare taste (and I do like steak quite pink just not red) so I sent it back. A couple of minutes later, they gave the same steak back with darker grill marks on the bottom and I cut through it again (this time it was the quarter of the steak) and it was the same rareness. I showed the server who kindly asked and he took it back again. The third time it came out, it was completely burnt on the bottom of the steak. I had hopes that the restaurant would not charge us this upsetting meal but the server said the chef/owner would not budge on discounting. The two servers also offered us alcohol on the house, which is totally against the liquor laws! I really hope this restaurant gets shut down soon because they aren't able to make enough money due to lack of customers. The chef/owner needs a wake up call."}
{"text":"What a great place to go to for a seafood dinner. The place is very clean and the waitress was very professional! We will return next time we visit Toronto.."}
{"text":"I organized an outing for a group at work for Summerlicious. I've been dying to go here for awhile now and it wasn't bad. I read some reviews before we went and I honestly expected the worst. I was pleasantly surprised with the food and not shocked at all by the lacklustre service.
We found the appetizers to be more on the generous side. My companions said that the Boston Clam Chowder was really good, my Kiwi Mussels were large in size but a little plain on the flavour, and well, the salad was just a plain old salad. Out of all the appetizers, we found it funny that the people who ordered the salad had to wait at least another 5 minutes to get it after everyone else had been served.
Everyone at our table ordered the Jambalaya which was packed with flavour and spice. It was surprisingly good.
Last but not least, dessert. The creme brulee was delicious, the panna cotta was alright, it reminded me a bit of rice pudding for some reason, and then the last person who ordered fruit and ice cream was served his ice cream sans fruit. He was not impressed. 
While we were getting our dessert, we had asked for our bill so that we could get out of there in a timely fashion. One of the diners had tried to get his bill previously so he could get to a meeting and that took 15 minutes to come. 
We had to wait 10 minutes for our bill and then when we needed to use the machine and the waiter said that he'd be right back...well, we didn't see him again. We ended ended up going to the front to pay because we simply couldn't wait any longer.
Coles notes: decent food but don't expect to hurry out of there. If you're in a hurry it might be best to ask for your bill when you're starting your appetizer"}
{"text":"Well apparently, I had a different experience than some other people here. I brought my parents who were visiting from out of town and we all had the Summerlicious menu.  We sampled the shrimp cocktail and caesar salad and both were exactly as promised. Firm lettuce, meaty shrimp. Tasty. Next the entrées. We had all three. The steak was basic, but well prepared with good sides. The salmon was good as well.  The lobster linguini was great and the lobster tail on top was delicious. I didn't find it too salty, which is usually my main complaint, so light on the salt isn't a problem for me. A little parm cheese and it was perfect!  My only complaint is that they were out of creme brûlée. A Saturday night in the middle of Summerlicious and you're out of one of your featured items at 7pm. Too bad, because that's the only thing stopping me from giving this a 5 star rating. The service was also great. Really nice group of people working there."}
{"text":"People who gave this place more than one star are either those who work here or are paid to write falsified reviews. I've been living in Toronto for 10 years and this restaurant has been my WORST EXPERIENCE by far. Seriously, I don't get how this place is still running. 

First, I would like to confirm that every review above is accurate. I only wish I read yelp before coming here. Our family came here for winterlicious to celebrate my mom's birthday. Let me summarize how everything went to shit.

Service: Extremely slow and inattentive. It took them minimum 10 min to ask for drinks and another 20 to take our order. Our drinks were clearly empty and they stayed that way throughout the entire meal. I should also add that we have never been \"waited\" besides when food came out for the 3 hours we were there. Our main came out 1 1/2 hour later and to top it all off, my dish finally showed up when the rest of the party was already done. I complained to the manager and guess what his response was. He put his hand on my shoulder, said \"sorry bud\" and just bolted... I didn't have any expectations at this point, but seriously? Sorry bud and shoulder rub? 

We couldn't be more happy to leave after sub-par desserts. When we asked for the bill 3 times and finally got it after 15min, ready to pay, we overheard from the table behind us yelling \"DON'T YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE MACHINE?!!!\" They asked for the bill when we got the dessert and they were even more pissed than us. 

Food: Ok. For me, if food is at least half-decent, I tend to be forgiving and generous on shit service. Here? Worst seafood restaurant I ever tasted. My \"tiger\" shrimps (that came out 30min late) came out wayy overcooked and bland, and rice made me gag. The sole was disappointing with no texture or flavour at all. The steak was the best part - rare somehow came out as medium well. Not even worth $10 imo, but $35? Please run as far away as you can.

Warning: don't order lobster bisque unless you want to choke on the shells and leave early on ambulance. 

PLEASE save your time and money and avoid this place!!! I created yelp account just now solely to save another poor soul. The worst part was that \"sorry\" - I'll never forget that. It was such a memorable experience in a way I never expected."}
{"text":"My mother and I visited because this was the closest place to our hotel, but I'm glad we did! We had crab cakes and bruschetta for apps and both were delicious (and both were half price because it was before 6pm and we had also ordered drinks). We each had a steak as well; both were cooked right and the sauce & butter were delicious. Our server was incredibly kind and went back to find answers to questions when we had them. She checked in on us often and paid special attention to my mother, which I truly appreciated. I felt the value for what we received was really good for Toronto (and I travel here often, both for work and personal reasons). We'll definitely come here again when we're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I really really REALLY wanted to like this place. Came here for summerlicious because of the appealing menu - I had lobster bisque, lobster tail linguine and the crème brulee (sounds good, right?). 
However, the actual food- Not so appealing.
Every single spoon I took of the lobster bisque had some shell in it, so I kept having to spit it out. A few shells here and there, I could probably deal with- it happens, it could've been a mistake. But for there to be THAT MANY? Did they just grind up a lobster, shell and all, then just dump it into the soup and hope we don't notice?? From there my expectations for the rest of the meal just went straight downhill.
The entrée was not too bad.. it was just normal alfredo linguine with a lobster tail on top. Not much to complain about.. but then again it is a $35 meal, so I was hoping it would be way better.
The crème brulee was probably the best part of the meal, although the bottom of it was a little too thick.
Contrary to the other yelp reviews, the service was not too bad. They were pretty attentive. I'll give it 2 stars just because of the service. 

Overall, save your money and go somewhere else, unless you like eating lobster shells."}
{"text":"I tried this place since it was around the corner from my old office and featured on Ritual.
I ordered the chicken and avocado sandwich for lunch. It took almost 30 mins for them to make it when the restaurant was empty. Portion size was good, but chicken was too pink for my liking and the fries were overcooked and so oily. The bread was fresh as was the avocado but that wasn't enough to save the meal. Before the Ritual discount from me signing up it's CAD 15.00 for that. Yikes."}
{"text":"I made a mistake and came here without checking yelp. Don't make my mistake. Don't come here. The service it's truly terrible. We sat at the table for ten minutes and no one came. No one appeared to be coming so we flagged down a waiter who clearly didn't think we were in his section. He apologized and said he would rush out food order. I had to wait over 25 minutes between my soup and my main. 

Everyone else's comments are accurate food is over priced. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was creamy and had lots of lobster. Weird I never had any shellfish like the other reviews said they had. Enjoyed my fish sole. Huge portion. My creme Brule and I tried my friends pan cotta was delicious. Great service and cozy atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Went with a group for winterlicious. The menu was pretty basic. The food was ok. Nothing spectacular or impressive.  (1 star)  The atmosphere seemed to attract dates. There were several couples who looked like they were on a first or second date... but where this place really leaves an impression is with their service.  It was nonexistent.  They were very pleasant and addressed our concerns but that was only when they showed up. For the majority of our meal they were absent. It took 20 minutes for them to take our order then at least 20 min for our soup then another 30 min for our main course. We were there for over two hours! It was terrible. Waitstaff changed halfway through with the second server not knowing our order which led to confusion when we finally received the check.  Overall,  I would not recommend this place.  There are plenty of other places with better food and service.   The other star is for location.  Very easy to get to by ttc or car."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check this place out since it moved to the new location on Church St. near my over.  The decor outside made it look like a nice, casual seafood place.  

I came here with a friend after work one day, and when we walked in, we were surprised at how much fancier it looked inside than from what it appeared on the outside.  The service was very friendly, the food was just okay, but none of it was enough to justify the prices.  

My friend and I both ordered the fish and chips because it was the cheapest thing on the menu (still $18/19 and it wasn't even halibut).  If you prefer the greasy beer battered fish, don't come here.  They use the more breaded version.  Pretty sure it was frozen as well.  

While it was an okay experience, I'm not sure if I would come back here for a \"casual\" dinner.  If they lowered their prices a bit, perhaps."}
{"text":"Save your money. Eat somewhere else. ANYwhere else. Food quality is horrid, portions are not even close to what menu suggests or what staff indicate. Prices are ridiculous. Shrimp was dry and overlooked, halibut tasted like freezer fish, diver scallops where more like small bay scallops. Kitchen door left open facing Church Street beside front entrance, creating cold draft through restaurant, I had to eat with my winter coat on. Don't waste your time or hard-earned money on this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service! The lobster bisque was amazing! We had Kim as our server and she was GREAT! She had awesome wine recommendations! Would come back again only if Kim was working! 5/5"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this establishment. They advertise some fish I've never heard of & chips for $16. Went in to ask if they had Halibut. They said yes. I asked if it was same price as the featured dish. She said add $9. You mean $25 for halibut fish & chips. She said yes. I asked again in case she didn't understand me. Yup $16 & $9=$25 for halibut fish and chips. Now I know why the place is always empty."}
{"text":"Really shady place. I wouldn't come here again.

I'm surprised this place is still standing and has any patrons at all. The exterior of the building suggests a hipster-esque food joint, but the interior and food prices scream the opposite. The furniture is kitschy and outdated. The service was hardly present. 

I had the fish and chips and it was very untraditional, and I did not appreciate that. The fish was breaded (breadcrumbs I think?) and the fries were overly seasoned. Not a great fish and chips meal at all. The prices were also too high considering the quality of the meal and experience. 

Take my word for it and don't come here- there are hundreds of better seafood options in the city."}
