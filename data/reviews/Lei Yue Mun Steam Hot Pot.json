{"text":"By far the worst Asian cuisine restaurant I've ever stepped into. Portion size was ridiculously small and the wait time between each food was excruciatingly long. My husband and I ordered 1 seafood platter which contained 4 shrimps, 6 mussels, 2 larger mussels, 2 abalone 2 clams came with veggies and we ordered udon on the sides and shrimp wontons.... The bill was 120$ never ever going back. I wouldn't be surprised if it closes in the next6 months"}
{"text":"We (me and 3 friends) came to this new restaurant trying out its steam hot pot food just yesterday. Actually one of my friends had heard about this place and so we wanted to see what is steam hot pot. It sounds to me that it's quite healthy to have everything steamed instead of pan fried with so much oil... We ordered a seafood platter for 4 people with a selection of pumpkin congee. The congee was put at the bottom level of the steam pot and all the seafood items were cooked on the top level of the pot. It's quite interesting watching the server put the food one by one on the steam hot pot and the food came out quite fresh and yummy.  Overall we found there's lot of fun having this kind of dining experience..."}
{"text":"Fresh, clean food and great service. Pretty environment and delicious soup at the end."}
{"text":"Lots of nice seafood. Food was fresh and delicious. They have a seafood inspired gourmet cooking experience going on and lots to choose from. A must try for the seafood lover."}
{"text":"This is a place for lazy peeps who prefer to have their food cooked for them, unlike hot pot where you gotta do all the hard work ;)  Came here for an early mother's day dinner and she really enjoyed this place. Food was fresh, service was decent and the staff were always very attentive.   Step one. Choose a soup or congee base. And yes there's a cost to this. We picked the pumpkin and pork congee. This cooks while the steaming happens and with all the fresh seafood juice that fell into the congee, this was really delicious at the end of the meal.   Step 2. We picked the seafood platter for 6. It comes with udon and veggies and was the perfect portions. The waitress who was serving us had a timer going, was always checking in on our food making sure it's not over cooked. This platter came with clams, fish, calamari, fish, and lobster. Very decent variety, quality, and overall the cost was good.   Based on previous experience at other places, I don't think steaming meat is good. But to each their own.   My parents liked it so much that they want to bring their friends asap. :)"}
{"text":"Seafood platter was fresh and delicious. Took our godmother visiting from out of town who loved this new idea of steamed seafood and getting to drink the soup after from the delicious drippings and condensation! No added oil or MSG, just fresh seafood and vegetables. Staff serve and prep each dish of selected seafood on the steamer for you and set the timer, so you eat the seafood at the perfected time for texture and flavour. Owners and staff are also quite friendly."}
{"text":"You can order two people seafood set dinner for 3 people, but waiter will try to sell per head count. Be careful They add the tips at the bill without telling you , also they charge $6 for a can of pop, definitely not go back ."}
{"text":"Fresh food, good service. Price is reasonable. We were able to download an app called Youpinhui(similar to groupon) and get the steam hotpot even cheaper. With $29.99 per person, we got to try mussels, clams, lobster, shrimps, 5 veggie, squid, oyster, etc... Highly recommend chicken soup on the bottom. Will def come back again."}
{"text":"Is it just me or is it getting hot in here? Not just hot....STEAMY. Oh baby.   Have I aroused some interest (wink)? Steaming is the sexy new trend from Asia for cooking your food  (not that there wasn't steamed food before, but not quite like this). You gather around a special steamer that sits on top of broth or congee ingredients (with no water). Servers steam the food for you with a timer for precision. The condensation from the steam drips back into the soup/congee ingredients, infusing the base with all types of seafood and veggie flavour. Now if that isn't sexy, I don't know what is.   Yes, this method of eating is not the cheapest. With a group of six, the combo set was $210, and an additional $30 for the herbal duck broth base. But the combo includes a boatload of small clams, oysters, abalone, shrimp, big clams, whole fish, squid, a tower of fresh veggies, noodles, and with a group of 4+, one lobster. I mean, the lobster isn't the biggest but...wait, am I seriously complaining about free lobster? NO. Just to buy those ingredients yourself (not counting preparation hassle) would be a hefty sum.   And you're not just paying for the abundant and fresh ingredients. You're paying for the service, which is exceptional. It wasn't busy, but we were serviced by 3-4 people. They were all professional and friendly, chatting with my grandparents and grabbing us whatever we needed right away. Things were cooked in a pace that matched our eating.   Steamed food can be plain but it also means you don't lose any of the freshness in the seafood or natural sweetness in the veggies. If you want something more, they've got soy sauce, house-made chili sauces, roasted garlic, and all kinds of condiments. The flavour of the broth afterwards, with the seafood infused steam water, is absolutely incredible.  Winter isn't just coming, it's here. So why not give steam hot pot a try? Bring an appetite and an open mind. The pot has never been hotter and the room has never been steamier.   (98/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Came here on a evening with a friend spent a total of $160 tax and tip included.    Was excited to try the place but left very disappointed and still very hungry.   Would definitely NOT RETURN.   This new concept of steaming is only worth trying ONCE.   Food was extremely bland as expected the food is cooked on a metal steam grate below the grate is the broth you have selected.  The steam is suppose to infuse whatever you maybe cooking with flavor from the broth you have chosen.  Which I found did next to nothing to give any taste at all.     There is soy sauce on the table accompanied with condiments in a separate basket they bring to you.   Had no idea how it worked as nothing was explained to me.  (most likely because I was not fluent in cantonese) Wasn't sure if I was suppose to cook the food and what not.  In the end it turns out they cook the food for you.  As each item had different cook times the staff would come cook the food and set a timer.     I got the $70 seafood platter for 2.     It came with 4 individually skewered shrimps, about 12 clams in shell, 2 oyster on shell, 2 cherry stone clams, 2 small abalone on shell, 6 pieces of squid that curls up when cooked, 1 tiny fish (pretty fishy in taste).   I personally think its not worth $70.   I figure there cost is max $15 to $20.    Got the large beef which was not bad. The chicken comes deboned.   There are 10 tables, 5 on each side.  Each table seats 6 people with 1 pot.  Come here if you like bland food or cannot consume salt/sodium.   Staff here were friendly and courteous.   I can not say the same which I assume are the owners husband and wife.  Both were unfriendly, unpleasant.   The wife stood behind me looking as I was paying the bill the look on her face looked as if I didn't have enough money to pay.     As I got up and left she came and counted the money on the table.  No thank you, no good bye nothing was said as I left.   I doubt this place will last a year.  Many restaurants in the exact same unit came and went many times over the years."}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh food. Clean. Large dining area. Excellent service. Decor of a high school girl dorm room.  With a price tag above $65 per person. I'd expect more positives than negatives.   I'd like to warn not to fall into the trap of ordering the seafood combo. Yet with the quality of the food product... Give it a shot.   Cooking is done by the wait staff. Expect a dining time of more than an hour.   One trick pony of an experience. No need for a redo.   3/5 fresh ingredients, friendly staff. Expensive and novelty."}
{"text":"Not a small price tag but you definitely get what you paid for.  This one gives you the best value out of its competitors of the same genre.  The seafood is fresh.  Service is friendly.  Place is clean, which is hard to keep up given the high volume of steam coming out of the food.  If you are into  tasting freshness and the original  taste of food, then definitely go for it.  You don't see the yucky,  murky water or back drips under your pot as in traditional hot pot places.  It uses a pressurized steaming technology,  so you can make  soup or congee with the same pot without affecting your food tastes, and with have freshly distilled water each time.  Minor complaints: the bass fillets could use more thorough descaling, the ladies' bathroom smelled like cigarette smoke, and the abalones didn't need to be overcooked.  It is still a relatively new place.  So given more time,  they will  have honed even better skills at controlling the cooking time for different types of seafood.  Bonus: you come out feeling like you have had a facial!"}
{"text":"2 Star for food (dim sum) + 1 Star for Service  Lei Yue Mun Steam Hot Pot is not a place to come alone during dinner time. Minimum order is the Seafood Platter for 2 at $70 or a plate of beef for $22.99 and the soup base is starting from $12.99.   From 8 am to 5 pm, they do have dim sum offering. Not a bad option as the $6.99 for 6 items were doable as a single diner. But I would suggest just have dim sum at a regular dim sum restaurant.   Dim Sum after ordered was steamed at the steamer at the table. At least they were freshly steamed. Don't order Egg York Lava Custard Bun as the filling was like a solid lump. Timing is really off. The other items were OK.  +1 Star for the nice waitress that serves me.  If you want to eat healthy, steaming maybe the way to go without being oily. But I can steam all my food at home..."}
{"text":"Was in the area last night so went to the supermarket to grab some groceries and was late so decided to check out the restaurants in the plaza.  Never had steamed hotpot so decided to give it a try.  I had my doubts but was quite surprised how good it was.  Had the seafood combo with the ribs and winter melon base.  Since there were 3 adults and 4 kids, on top of the combo we ordered more shrimps, clams, beef, veggies, and dim sum for the kids.  The seafood was so fresh and sweet the kids were fighting for them and they managed to finish all of the dim sum as well.  I made my own dipping sauce but only used a little bit for the beef as the seafood was so sweet there was no need.  We had to order more of everything the second time around as it was so good and the kids ate more than we expected.  We ate so much I was in a food coma and forgot about the base.  When I tried the base and WOW! a very nice way to end dinner, the soup was so sweet and tasty.  We could only drink a little bit of the base as we were extremely full but took the rest home.  I guess because we ordered so much the owner gave us 20% off and the dim sum platter for free.  We also got a VIP card for 20% off future visits so I will definitely be going back even though I live in Etobicoke.  Even though I was full I didn't feel gluttoned, the food was so healthy I just didn't feel guilty like I would after a buffet meal.  Got to know the owners and they were a great couple, really friendly and took care of us. Too bad the location is far away from where I am but will be dropping in every time I`m in the area"}
