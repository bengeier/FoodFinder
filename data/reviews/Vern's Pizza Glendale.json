{"text":"If you're thinking about pizza tonight, and want it piled high with meat, this is the right place.  Every pizza has SO MUCH MEAT, and in case that's not enough for you, they have ones that have EVEN MORE MEAT.   These are the most delicious on your way home from a night on 17th ave, or delivery for you and your friends.   They are a bit pricey but you will be stuffed... with meat. Buy a whole pizza, share it with your pal, enjoy your meat sweats.    I think I used the word 'meat' way too much in this review :S"}
{"text":"This reminds me of the eastcoast, lots of cheese, lots of pepperoni. This pizza is more expensive than your economy junk, but it's worth the premium. So far it's the best pizza I've found in Calgary."}
{"text":"Okay, everyone loves a good slice of pizza, and Vern's makes a pretty darn good piece of pizza.  The only problem with that delicious slice of pie is the fact that you're paying $4 for a tiny little sliver.  I'm not joking.  One piece of pizza came to $3.95 and, even though it had loads of toppings, didn't fill me up.  If I'm paying that much for ONE slice, I expect it to be one damn big piece of pizza.  Nope, not at Vern's.  I'll admit that they really do load the toppings on at this place.  I don't even know what kind of pizza I had, but it has tons of ham, pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers, and pineapple.  What kind of pizza would you call that?  Deluxe?  Sure.  To make it worth your while, I would recommend buying a whole pizza, which they do sell.  They have everything they make listed on their menu, which is actually on a flat screen TV.  This makes the words a little tiny, but it's kind of neat.  The whole pizzas are also quite pricey, but at least you know you'll be full after eating more than one pizza.  So, to recap, lots of yummy delicious toppings, but waaay to expensive for the size of slice you get.  Why buy one piece of pizza for $4 from here when you can get a whole pepperoni pizza from Little Caesar's for only a dollar more?"}
