{"text":"Just tried this place the other day for lunch. The food is awesome. Service is pretty good however, my coworkers complained their service was not so good yesterday."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Bert's several times since it's opening and I can say I haven't found a dish I haven't liked yet. Here are my top 3 favorites:

The Shrimp and Grits were fabulous. I'm a bacon fiend and it has a lot of crumbled bacon on the top.  My friend, who is not quite as a fanatic about bacon as I am, said it was a little too much bacon. So if you are not a huge bacon lover, request light on the bacon (don't leave it off though; it adds a nice flavor).

The meatloaf is also one of my favorites. Very moist but you need to like a little kick in your food though because this one has a bite. 

Fried Chicken and Waffle finishes out my 3 favorites.  I've never had chicken and waffles until Bert's.  Actually never thought the two would work together but was amazed ant how it complements each other.  The maple drizzle really brings the two different taste together.

My favorite sides: Jalapeno Blue Cheese Slaw (another one with a kick) and sweet potato chips."}
{"text":"I had received a mailer w/some good coupons so I decided, \"eh, what the heck, I have a coupon.\"  I called ahead to make sure they weren't closing soon since it was almost 9pm.  The dining room was empty (it was a Wednesday night) and there were a few people at the bar.  It was really clean and the waitress immediately told us they were only serving off the bar menu and handed me a very limited bar menu.  Not much to choose from but I was really hungry and it was getting late so we decided to stay and get some wings and a beer battered fish sandwich w/chipotle mayo and some kind of coleslaw, not your average slaw.  They had a great selection of wing sauces.  We chose the honey hot and garlic parmesean.  Wings were good, not great like Wing Kings, but good and large, unlike the small/med wings everywhere else. We wanted to order more but the server said they ran out, we had \"ordered the last batch\"...and they ran out of sweet tea also! The running out of stuff was kinda weird but oh well.  The beer battered fish was sooooo good! My mouth is watering right now!  The batter was light and crispy with a good flavor and the fish was flaky and very fresh tasting.  The coleslaw was a little unusual, not bad, just different and the chipotle mayo was a little too spicy for my taste buds.  I really enjoyed the food and look forward to eating off of the dinner menu.  I will definitely be back! I definitely recommend if you are in the area and are looking for good food and a laid back causual atomosphere. Oh yes!  Did I mention the value?  Wednesdays are $0.35 wings!  Yes, do the math! That was a really inexpensive dinner for 4! And the fountain drinks and sweet tea w/unlimited refills are only $.99 each!  Oh yeah and I didn't even use the coupons! :)"}
{"text":"Bert's just opened in the shopping center that houses the SC DMV.  The restaurant itself consists of a large open dining room with a bar area (with high tables and bar stools along the bar) with a sports theme.

I was seated quickly in the dining room area and perused the single sheet menu.  Think American with a twist.  Items on the menu included cajun meatloaf, chicken and waffles, and stuffed burgers.  Of particular note, was the option of fresh sweet potato chips as a side option.

I chose an appetizer of chips and guacamole ($4.95) and a lunch order of salmon tacos ($8.25 for two) with a side of the sweet potato chips.  Suprisingly, they let me order the lunch order during the dinner hour.  

The chips and guac came out within five minutes of ordering.  The guac was pretty smooth with some chunks of pepper scattered throughout.  The chips were good, but were not served warm.  Bummer.  My tacos came out not more than 10 minutes after the chips.  There were two flour tortillas chock full of salmon with a pineapple blue-cheese slaw and chipotle sauce.  The tacos were killer. I'd get them again in a heartbeat.  The chips I got on the side were still warm and were drizzled with a maple cream cheese sauce.  The sauce provided a nice sweet compliment to the sweet potato taste.

Service was great and my waiter was really friendly.  I'll be back!"}
