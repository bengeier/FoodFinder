{"text":"I've been going to diamonds for about 15 years. The food and prices are amazing. But if you are looking for a \"pretty\" restaurant, Diamonds won't fit the bill. I'd rather have amazing food and so-so decor personally.   The portions are very generous, go for lunch and you will have enough for dinner too!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place for years and have never had a bad meal. I could care less about how a place looks. You can't eat ambiance. This food is the closest I have come to the food I have eaten in Tai Wan.  The two months I spent there taught me to eat with my mouth and not with my eyes, nose or mind. That is where a cultured pallet comes from."}
{"text":"Superb.   The food was on-spot, delivered in a timely fashion, and were dressed up quite nicely.  Whenever I go, Chinese people are always lined up, excited, and leave delighted. One woman I spoke to says that once a year, she comes up from Tucson to enjoy the food, saying it's one of the best, reasonably-priced, authentic Chinese places in Arizona   i have been attending for years and always look forward to my visits, to where the waitress/proprietor now has my order already taken down, before I even sit, saving a few minutes time and showing the great customer service."}
{"text":"This is a hard to write review for me. My first visit of this restaurant was in 1999, and I have to say that it has seen better days.  Nothing has changed since 1999, the food was still good, the price is still decent, the decoration, plates and silverware remain unchanged/ renewed either. Oops, one thing did change, it went from a joint family restaurant to one family restaurant. With the slow down business, it's a husband and wife team for the entire place now. So, be prepared for the slowness and the lack of friendly services.    I missed the weekly fresh seafood they used to have. Now they get fresh things about once a month if you are lucky.  I was once very loyal to this place and visit at least weekly if not more. But three bad experiences helped with this review and I will think twice before step in there ever again.  I ordered a rock fish once, and careful as I always am, I double checked the price with them and asked how much does the fish usually weight. We were charged double for the estimate they gave me when we got our bill. She told me it's $13.99 per lb and 3 lbs per fish. We were charged $19.99 per lb and 4.5 lbs for the fish. Though the fish was surely not big enough to fill two of us up, at least they corrected the price with a straight face. (And still charged for 4.5 lbs...) I felt cheated, especially being such a loyal customer for such a long time. The sign is even up on the wall, were they hoping to not have customer check their bills?  How long do you have to wait for a simple won ton soup?! That you ordered to go in advance?! On a one table dine-in slow night?? One hour!!! At least that's how long I waited. And I asked several times, I just kept on got brushed off with almost, almost. Eventually, she stopped responding to me and just walked away. Of all things, won ton soup!!!! It usually take no more than 10 min anywhere else! I was furious for the long wait and the neglect!  The last bad experience I had was when the husband and the wife (chef and the waitress) decided to have an open argument in the restaurant. Though we weren't the only table there, but it was uncomfortable for everyone there. Also, though I am not allergic to fresh shell fish, I am allergic to even pre frozen ones. That's just say the fresh shellfish we ordered that night (I saw them fish it out of the tank!!!) gave me terrible allergy reaction...  I don't know... I have to say I lost faith at this place now... But I surely do miss it's glorious past..."}
{"text":"Have to give only three stars, if the place wasn't so dirty, old, out-dated to put it in a nicer way. The menu scared me since it was sticky and dirty......a little spray vinegar, water, and some soap would do wonders. Surprise....surprise the food was excellent!. All the signs on the walls and filthy windows aside....it was good Chinese food. Would buy it again...to go.   What's with all the empty gross looking tanks as you walk in, we almost turned around and ran. What a shame, they could do a much better business if they cleaned it up, and put some table covers over the old tables, and took down all the old card board signs off the walls."}
{"text":"The food at this place is yummy, it is authentic.  If you think otherwise,  you likely enjoy places like Panda Express or Pei Wei... bleh!  The service at this place isn't the best, in fact it is awful!  That's why my fiancee and I always take the food to go.  We ordered dinner from there last night and the waitress was amazingly nice, she even had a hard time accepting the tip...NUTS!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place is in business. Fried rice tasted fishy and the pork was totally dried out. Sweet sour chicken had no vegetables. My understanding is that this dish has peppers, pineapple, etc.  Crystal shrimp was shrimp tossed in an over abundance of clumpy mayo with a few plain untoasted walnuts on top. Worst Chinese food ever, in a dark corner of a bad neighborhood and the restaurant is not fixed up nice at all. Stay away."}
{"text":"Super nice attentive lady. Food was decent and tasty. Large portions. We were the only one there on a Friday afternoon. So it was nice and quiet.   Felt like an authentic space.  You'll understand once you are inside."}
{"text":"Food was good, have to give them that. Only if you don't mind the sloooooooow service, 2-hr for lunch there is not exactly where I want to spend my power lunch. Be sure to check and double check you bill for overcharging, not sure if ours was just an honest mistake or they tried to pull a fast one. My mom did warned us about their way of billing is some what similar to some law firms, I thought she was patronize.  I don't have the time nor extra unwanted cash in my wallet, so I will not be back. Dine there at your own risk."}
{"text":"I SO want to give this place 5 stars because the food is just so good.  Excellent and flavorful recipes -- really!  Some of the best Chinese food we've ever had, ever.  Anywhere.  But the 2 stars is for the filthy appearance of the place, and the worst-ever service you'll ever experience.  You may get your food delivered to the table in 15 minutes, or it might be an hour (yes, this is common here!) and your dishes will always, always be delivered to your table in no particular order, so different members of your party will not be served at the same time, not by a long shot.  The owner (and only apparent server) knows us now that she's learned our daughter-in-law speaks Chinese, and has softened her attitude to us.  But the many times we've been here prior to that, she was rude and rather sullen.  We witnessed an embarrassing shouting match one night between her and a customer.  They yelled at each other loud and long in Chinese and was very uncomfortable for the entire restaurant to have to listen to.  I guess the dirtiness and grunginess of the floors and the bathroom is the final reason we won't be coming back.  They've been written up by the health inspectors many, many times for major infractions; these have been published in the newspaper restaurant inspection column.  Not sure how they've managed to stay open.  I guess people overlook the dirt because the food tastes so good.  I'm not sure I want to see in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"What a strange experience this was.  I've been driving past this place for years and never stopped to try it despite the fact that the parking lot is PACKED in the evenings.  Today I thought I'd give it a  try.  Much has already been said about the appearance of this place and I'd have to agree.  It's in need of a good cleaning...WITH A HIGH POWERED PRESSURE WASHER...but the food was excellent and the prices were great.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Lots of food and the price was great.  Enjoyed the House Special: Hotplate chicken beef and pork."}
{"text":"We lasted about 5 minutes in this place. One family walked out as we were getting there. They had been waiting an hour for their food. To start, the menus were dirty, there was a strange odor, and the tables and glasses didn't look so clean. Then the waitress came over, with a dirty, wet shirt, and she looked like we just said, \"This is a stick up\" when we asked if we could order drinks. She took our order, put our soup bowls on the table and left the room. The bowls she had put down had little bits of dirt caked on the inside. That was all it took. We made our apologies and left. Btw-Did I mention that after we left the place, it was completely empty. (Cue the whistling theme song to The Good, The Bad and The Ugly)"}
{"text":"As a native Asian, I have high tolerant towards to dirty/nasty Chinese restaurant. But man, this place is by far the most extreme I have ever seen in the State of Arizona! This place runs by Chinese mainland Mandarins. Some elder friends had a birthday party here so we had no choice but dine at this place.  Services are horrible, we had 2 tables 2X guests. The waitress pretty much treat us and herself invisible. We had to look for the cleaning cart and clean our own plates (put away bones). The plates, chairs, table, floor, the whole place is DIRTY and STICKY! Silverware has a filthy layer on top. Lots of the spoons still have sauce on it, which been dried up. At some point, they turned off the AC to save electricity... WTF?!  Food-wise, LOTS of MSG, more than any other places. We had to drink lots of water after dinning here. Food is cheap but you get what you paid for. They deep fried the duck and stream fish, which is unbelievable. The only reason deep fried the food is because they are too old/not fresh enough to present. We can taste the nastiness of the oil on every dishes. We are very curious, HOW can this restaurant survive for many years?"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! It's truly a whole in the wall, and not the most cleanly looking of places. BUT OMG! The food is to die for.   Probably some of the best Chinese food I have ever had, I love bringing my family here and eating family style. You really can't go wrong with anything you order. One of my favorites is the Dancing Mushroom dish. YUM!   Service is a bit impolite, but everything is fresh and I don't mind it because it's part of the culture of the place. Love it here!"}
{"text":"The first time I visited Diamond was thirty years ago. I been eating here from time to time for past thirty years.  They have two menu; one is Americanized version of Chinese food. IE. Sweet and sour pork, ...orange beef.... Mongolian beef...etc  The other menu;  ( a sheet of pink paper with Chinese writing). Food in this menu is intended for Ethnic Chinese or Ethnic Asian. They offer the most authentic Southern Chinese food in town. Hefty portion very Delicious  and super low price. Food on this menu ... absolutely 5 star.  Decor is mediocre at best. but acceptable.  Cleanliness . Among the worst. However, If Diamond was to compare only with other Chinese restaurants. Then its not so bad.   This place have potential to be TOP authentic Chinese restaurant  if they are willing to spend more that a nickle for decors and do some clean up."}
{"text":"I really used to love going to this place, even if it's not the cleanest, the waitress is crabby, and the service is crap, but the food was delicious! But now, even the food is mediocre, the quality has gone down the drain. Having to wait 40 minutes for your food when the restaurant is empty, aaaand not even be good is just not groovy, Such a shame, I used to be a regular. Good thing my boyfriend and I have found a new Chinese joint."}
{"text":"Beef with broccoli, steamed rice, and egg roll. Sooo good!! best I've had in Phoenix!!! Restaurant is not the nicest on the inside but their food is very fresh!!  As many other people have said, calling before you get there saves lots of tome!! Ate here two days in a row and sesame chicken and green beans with chicken are awesome also!! Great amount of food for price also!!!"}
{"text":"What a crap hole.  I stopped here twice to give it a try, both times nobody came out to help me I even sat around for a bit last time.  No thanks, never again"}
{"text":"This is such a tough call. The food is really, really good. The actual restaurant itself is below par. That said, here ya go ---  Stopped in for a quick dinner with the family. The first thing that we notice is that the place is fairly rundown. The second thing we notice is that the AC does not work very well. It was really hot in the place.   We decided what the heck, we are already here, let's eat. We ordered pot stickers, hot and sour soup, garlic chicken, chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, and mu shu pork. I have to say that I was quite surprised. The food was delicious! The pot stickers were crisp and fresh. The sweet and sour was darn good as well. Light batter. Not overly sweet.  Couple of additional thoughts - We had the kids with us so it was pretty standard fare; however, the menu actually has some interesting looking items on it. Lastly, I think the food is worth it, but I think I would go for take out next time.   N*joy"}
{"text":"Yes, the food at this place is okay, with killer prices, however, if you are okay with the filth and rancor of this place, even for takeout, then you must like to drink the water in Mexico, and pick up gum off the ground to chew on.  I watched the owner scoop a fish out of the tank, then chase it around on the floor when it jumped out of the bussing tray. Needless to say, noone cleaned up the fish scales, or mopped, or anything so pedestrian-gotta keep it authentic, right?  And the food, while good, is not great. One time our duck in brown sauce and spicy chicken ended up as damn near the same dish-both had the same veggies, and the same gloopy brown sauce. The only difference was the poultry, and I know my food well enough to know the dishes should have been very different. Due to the awesome cheapnes of the place, I didn't mind throwing out most of the meals.  Other meals with friends have been decent, but not a good as Gourmet House of Hong Kong-which has its own brand of dive, but at least there I never had to fight a cockroach for my meal...  Based on my experiences, and the wonderful bridge of connection that is Yelp, I will not be dragging myself back to this place anytime soon. I always see a lot of asian families here, and they seem to enjoy it very much, which is usually indicative of a great spot. Not this time, I pass. They can have my share of the roach w/ vermicelli..."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall yes so don't expect Panda Express. MSG??What small hole in the wall Chinese, Thai, or Vietnamese restaurant does NOT use MSG?? (and there is no scientific proof msg is bad for you!) But ask waitress (owner's wife) to cut msg if that suits you better. Delicious authentic food if you order from the Chinese menu. And don't expect friendly smiling service. The best mom and pop Chinese restaurants are rude but you go there for the food. Can't stand dirty floors, chipped plates, cloudy spoons either? You won't survive in Bangkok, Hanoi, or Hong Kong if you're looking for cheap, tasty food that all the locals go to. Might as well just eat at those clean, expensive restaurants only American tourists go. But if the atmosphere doesn't suit you, order to go and eat in the comfort of your home. I think this restaurant's food is tasty and delicious and worth the wait and adventure!"}
{"text":"My uncle has raved about this place over the years. He moved from Phoenix years ago but has insisted we go. Well, I wish I could have a meal do over and erase this food experience from my memory bank. My cousins came into town and as a favor to him we all went. It was the worst food and customer service ever. There was one table occupied and we were the second one. It smelt horrible as we entered, like old fish. It was very dirty and run down. Service was slow, food came out before the soup. Food was bland and tasteless. It was like the lady who took our order was the only one there, she took our order and disappeared. We wondered if she was back there trying to cook it too. When the bill came, some of the prices didn't match what was on the menu. Overall, just a real low quality experience!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent (ordered the chinese broccoli with beef, beef chow fun, clams in black bean sauce, duck, and the walnut shrimp). The food came out pretty slow though but overall the food was great."}
{"text":"BEST WHOLE ROASTED PORK EVER!!! I hosted a party and asked if they do lechon since we are partly Filipino. And they did not disappoint!!! It's so worth it!!"}
{"text":"To give one star to a restaurant with five star food tells you a bit about the cleanliness of the place.  This is without a doubt the BEST Chinese food on Phoenix; also, the filthiest restaurant I have ever been in.  How the health dept. doesn't shut them down is a wonder.  Tables and utensils are sticky from dirt and roaches abound.  Walls grimy; the whole place needs a steam cleaning.  My son and I (both owned restaurants for over 30 years) will not step foot in here again which is really a shame since the food is so good.  Impossible to talk with owners as they barely speak English.  If you must go, close your eyes!  Place has been near empty both time we went, sign is unlit, service not so great .....But the food is fantastic.  If it sounds like I have mixed emotions here, I do!!!  If they would just clean ths would be five stars in my book."}
{"text":"If you want traditional Chinese fare at a very reasonable price, then Diamond's is your place. They have fresh whole lobster, crab and fish cooked in a ginger/onion or black bean sauce. It's ridiculously awesome.   We also ordered Mongolian Beef, Shrimp and Snow Peas, Salt and Pepper Prawns and Chicken Fried Rice. Everything was tasty and the bill was unbelievably cheap. Such a great find!"}
{"text":"If I could give  zero stars, this is a place that would get it.  I can get passed environment and overall decor (absolutely...old) if there is good service and food. Unfortunately the service was terrible. There were three tables of people and there must have only been one cook. We gave our order and waited. The waitress didn't come around for at least 25 minutes. We never received tea as we asked. Food crawled slowly to the other tables as time drained. At 40 minutes we finally decided to go, only paying as the waitress said the food would only be alone minute. We asked for it to be bagged, then waited another 15 minutes....just terrible...."}
{"text":"absolutely the best authentic Chinese food around, and we've had Chinese food all over the country and Europe. yes, it isn't the Ritz, but they have cleaned up their act quite a bit. yes, service may be slow at times but it is worth the wait if you like good food. we actually drive to phoenix from Tucson just to eat there. I can now taste their 'stir fried flounder'....."}
{"text":"There is a God in Phoenix and (s)he is Chinese. For the last 6 years I've been on a quest for decent Chinese food in Phoenix and come up consistently empty-handed. Diamonds answered my prayers.  Everything I've ever ordered (I get take out about once a week and try to mix it up with safe faves and new diversions), has been fantastic.  Diamonds is the real deal for Chinese in Phoenix, as substantiated by the fact that every time I'm in there there's  a very healthy multi-cultural   mix of Asians, Latinos and Euros.  When you walk in and you see the bubbling tanks of fresh fish & crustaceans plus a room full of Chinese diners -- you know the place is good.   The two key indicators of good Chinese IMHO are the fried rice and the lo mein.  No BS here and no fakery. No nasty dried out yellow/orange sazon goya rice with frozen peas and no Barilla scorched in oil masquerading as lo mein.  Diamonds fried rice (all kinds) is the best I've had in 30 years and all of their dishes are custom cooked to order and sered brilliantly hot. From soups to apps to main dishes, everything is fresh and delicous.  The one downside (which is why I gave only 4 stars) is that when I'm craving Diamonds, I'm worse than a crack-whore jonesin a fix. I need it  NOW.  And as they prepare each meal to order the wait can sometimes be laborious.  They also have a stock answer of \"20 minutes\" for any order and I've placed my orders in advance and sometimes waited up to 45 minutes for the take-out to be ready.  In their defense that has been when I've gone in to pick up my take out and the place got packed and I think they prioritize those in the location over take-out orders sometimes... which stands to reason when you have a hungry table of people waiting, I guess.  The lady who works the counter is always nice while I'm waiting, offers me a seat and a glass of water, so I cant be too pissed at 'em.  Face it -- we're not in NY, San Fransisco or any town with a real Chinatown, so when it comes to getting your authentic fix for Chinese in Phoenix, Diamonds is worth the wait every time!"}
{"text":"This restaurant does indeed have a problem with general cleanliness.  However, the food was really good and so I'd probably still go back.  My friend and I spent about $10 each for one of the family dinners...and let me tell you, it was an enormous amount of food!  It even included a whole lobster, which was really tasty.  You will see most of the seafood chillin in the tanks when you first walk in, so you know it's at least freshly killed.  However, like the other reviewers I can't give this more than 2 stars since the place is so filthy.  In all seriousness, the service was friendly but I had to keep kicking a cockroach away with my foot during dinner.  Honestly, these guys could dominate the local market for traditional chinese dining if they'd just clean up a little and spend more than five dollars on the interior decor.  All the handwritten signs all over the walls advertising prices on fresh \"geo ducks\" and shrimp, along with the harsh fluorescent lighting, are just over-the-top carelessness."}
{"text":"Well this place is not a palace but it's got great food and has allot of locals that go there. It's one of the few places I've ever seen that have a large Asian patronage that fill the place up, To me this is a very good sign as I know that the food authentic and not very overly westernized. The food is awesome and very large portions and the eggrolls are to die for. The menu has a few exotic items and there are non-menu items that are offered and if you can read Chinese there are menu posters that have more intersting dishes for the more brave. As for fresh seafood some you can't get any fresher as there tanks in the reception area filled with crabs, lobsters, fish, and large prawns. The cons. of the place is that it's not one of the cleanest places I have eaten at and service can be slow and awkward due to the wade staff having a slight language barrier. The water is not very tasty as it's tap and so is the ice, So I would suggest if you come here and you should, don't be in a hurry and be exact on your orders and you'll have a great meal. Also have a open mind and a empty tummy too ;-)"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and ordered take out a few times since my initial visit and review. The food is always very good and authentic. Lobster is the cheapest in town and the ginger/scallion sauce is so good. Slobber it all over your rice. Other favorites include clam in spicy sauce, salt and pepper shrimp, beef and chinese broccoli. I don't think I've had a dish that was bad.   Yes, the place can be dirty and/or smelly but the food is the most authentic Chinese I've had in Phoenix and definitely worth a try. It'll put all your Americanized chinese places to shame."}
{"text":"Menu says Crap Puffs...that should have been my first clue.  Egg flour soup looked like snot.  Lemon chkn = grilled chkn pieces with goo!  There were three of us and two of us were served together.  When we finally decided that they had completely forgotten one meal and got up to leave (as we all shared the two meals and were finished eating) they brought the third meal!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food at a rediculous low price. I found this restaurant on Yelp while searching for Chinese Seafood on Yelp.  Some fellow Yelper said the lobster was good, so I decided to check it out.  I just finished hiking in Sedona and felt hungry for some authentic Chinese food.  I had to drive more than eighty miles to reach this place.  I was a little out of my mind at that time.  I was glad the quality did not let me down. When I first walked in the restaurant, there were no customer so I was a bit skeptical.  I read the menu and it was quite authentic so gave it a shot.  I had ordered  Chinese broccoli in Oyster sauce 6.5 Fried tofu 5.95 Lamb in scallion 6.95 Steamed Live big mouth Bass 15 x 1.75 = 26.75 Rice was compliment, a lot of authentic Cantonese restaurant charged for rice. They were all very tasty.  The food come in a slow paced.  I thought the owner was the only chef working in the kitchen and his wife was the only waitress working in the front. The decor was simple and outdated.  You should not look for good decor or friendly service at restaurant of this low price.  Service was not top notched but not mean nor rude.  I had a conversation with her after my meal, she was reasonable friendly and suggest places for me to go in Phoenix.  While I was into the middle of me meal, other customers came in.  I wished this business would be in good health in the years to come."}
{"text":"An update here.  On Saturday, I ordered some take out and a whole 25-30 pound roasted suckling pig for a pig-out dinner with my children and my grandchildren -- just seven of us.  The pig was great, but we all wished the skin could have been crispier.  Some parts were crispy, but some parts were chewy.  I think this is because of the difficulty in roasting a whole pig in an oven as opposed to over a fire (spit roasting style).  But their prices for a whole roasted suckling pig is the best you will find in town --- $150 for my size, $170 for the next bigger size, etc. etc.  And the taste is pretty darn good.  The take out I ordered was good again, but I asked that the roast duck I ordered not have the sauce poured on it.  But unfortunately it did.  The owner who does the cooking is pretty good as a chef, IMO, but his customer service skills are the pits.  And he is pretty rude too.  I told him about \"no duck sauce\" and he yelled and said yeah, yeah, yeah --- but unfortunately, his ability to comprehend and follow instructions leaves much to be desired.  I will go back because I love the menu, the taste, and the prices.  But again his customer service really sucks big time."}
{"text":"Such a great find in central Phoenix. This little hidden gem is a small run down place, but the food is authentic and awesome! Never judge a book by its cover. As soon as we walked in I knew it was going to be great. Huge portions, great prices, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"FRIED SALT AND PEPPER LOBSTER! LITERALLY THE BEST DISH I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!! ONLY $15  Diamonds is as Authentic as it gets with great food, poor service and hidden Asian menu that you have to ask for.   If your looking for good or speedy service look elsewhere. But for amazing and cheap authentic Chinese/ Vietnamese dishes you found your spot (just be pre-paired to wait 15-30 min for food)  My fav dish is deep fried lobster for the beautiful price of $15 (ask for salt and pepper lobster) that is fresh from tank and cooked when ordered. It is the best dish with an amazing taste!  Best dishes: salt pepper lobster ginger crab steamed fish duck pork with skin  if you get Asian menu look on back for combination's you can get  claims lobster steamed fish pork rice   all for $35"}
{"text":"This, my friends, is THE place to get some very authentic Chinese food.   The servings are HUGE for what you're paying...shucks, they are huge no matter which way you look at it so be careful not to order too much food unless you want leftovers. Who doesn't like leftover Chinese food anyway?  My recommendations are the Sweet and Sour chicken, the Egg Foo Yung and the chow mein. You will not be disappointed.  You'll also find the soups on the back of the menu at an average of 4 bucks or so. You will be pleasantly surprised when you get the bowl...it can feed at least 6 people. She will bring small bowls out and serve it for you right at the table. Give the hot and sour soup a try.  As for the service, it depends on how you look at it. Don't be afraid to get up and refill your own water. Shoot, the waitress is the only one that's there, give her a break already. She must own the joint with her husband because there is always this little kid in the corner playing on his laptop. So, get your own water and your own take home containers if you want. She doesn't have a problem with it.  Yes, the place is a little worn but you don't go there to look at pretty stuff. It's not dirty, just broke down. You'd be broke down too if you practically gave away your food in abundance to your customers. Who has money for new furniture if you take care of your customers bellies.  The lobster, crab and fish are fresh and cheap. Try finding lobster somewhere else in the valley for 10 bucks a pound, I dare ya.   So, head on out, just don't go on a Wednesday, that's their day off. They are open 11AM to 11PM every other day though. You can call in your order and pick it up if you don't want to look at the place.  Oh yeah, and if you ever go in there and it smells horrid, it's not the place, it's a popular dish that some customers order called \"Salty Fish\". It stinks to all heck! If that plate comes out I usually pack up my food, giggle and finish my meal at home. I don't mind one bit, that's just the way it is.  Oh and the waitress does speak good English, however, you wont find many Caucasians frequenting this place. That means the food is pretty authentic!"}
{"text":"Okay, the service and appearance of the restaurant isn't the best but the Chinese food here is my favorite. Don't let the poor exterior, unfriendly server, and long wait time prevent you from trying the delicious food! Their roast duck is unique and yummy. I recommend taking out because their service is truly terrible."}
{"text":"A delicious hidden gem of a Chinese restaurant that I've been going to for near 30 years. The chicken and beef dishes are amazing, as are the fried rice and noodle dishes. When you have time to sit, talk, sip tea and wait for some really good Chinese food this is your place to head to."}
{"text":"Taste: The food tastes good for the most part. Roast duck is second to none and so is their lobster. That said, everything else tastes mediocre. This is where the 1 star came in.  Where they lose it all is on sanitation/aesthetics/service. This place is filthy and when I say filthy i mean FILTHY. There are roaches, there are incredibly sticky tables, there are unclean restrooms, there are unchanged vents in the restrooms, the smell from the restroom, the lack of soap in the restroom, lack of paper towels in the restroom. When you walk into the restaurant, you can feel shit inside your nostrils immediately and you know you are walking into a polluted greenhouse. It is hot as hell and I am positive there are significant contaminants in the air. The vents in the restrooms and in the restaurant are so incredibly old that you can see the layers upon layers (from years upon years, and I have actually been here for years to see this progression) of dust growing on each other.  The service is horrendous. You will get an unhappy waitress take your order. Then you will get your food 30+ minutes later. Then you wont see them until you get the check.  I have been here +20 times in the last 7 years because my parents like it. I would never come here on my own and neither should you lest you be coerced."}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely amazing, great place for family, friends or just to hang out. Right across from the strip and they have great serves."}
{"text":"My first visit to this restaurant! We did take out: lobster with ginger and onion, half a roast duck, stir fried green beans with pork! SO, SO good! Will be going back to try the crab, steamed whole fish and steamed live shrimp, which the owner told me today is only in season 3 months out of the year! (April to June) I didn't give them 5 stars only because we didn't eat in and can't evaluate the service (although the owner started off cool, she warmed quickly and was very pleasant and welcoming by the time our order was ready to take home)."}
{"text":"Very Slow service, be prepared to wait for at least 25-30mins for your food.It's a family run business, the husband cooks in the kitchen. The wife is the only waitress. That explains it all.  The price for seafood is awesome , and pretty Authentic Chinese cooking. Warning, this restaurant looks run down, and kinda dirty. Suggest to call and order ahead, or do take out."}
{"text":"Have been there a couple times now. The food is awesome and authentic!   Service: Food takes quite a while to come out, even when the restaurant is almost empty, but it is apparent that they take care in preparing it. The waitress there wasn't very pleasant either time I dined there. She rolled her eyes at me when I ordered something from the traditional menu. I would have ordered out, but they don't have a website to look at a menu on, and they don't have paper menus that you can take with you. I forgot to take pictures of the menu the first time (but I did the second time, and will post them - you're welcome). I wish I had taken out (see next paragraph).   Ambiance: The place is dirty and plain. My friends and I were harassed by a brave cockroach the second time I went there. Will be taking out from now on. It is cool that they have live seafood tanks, so you can see how fresh the food is.   Food: Amazing and authentic. You can taste the care that they put into their sauces, and they know how to cook meat properly. Portions are generous! What I've had: -Mooshu Beef: Best I've ever had.  -Crab Rangoons: Meh. They definitely skimp on the filling; there's barely any, but an order comes with many won tons.  -Mongolian Beef: Awesome.  -Shark Fin Soup: Very good, but many Americans won't be used to the glass noodles. Also be aware that it is $3 per person, but they wouldn't allow me to get it just for myself (why restrict a soup like that? Idk. ) -Brisket Clay Pot (traditional): very little actual brisket meat. Mostly tendon and fat. The cabbage was awesome though, and great flavor.  -Egg Flower Soup: very good and traditional, and they don't add that yellow food coloring crap.  -Garlic Chicken: They definitely don't skimp on the garlic. It's great! -Crystal Shrimp: Really Really Good.   Prices: Very good. Everything on the menu is priced fairly, except for the shark fin soup (only because, as aforementioned, everyone at the table has to order it, even if only one person wants it, for $3 each for a small cup).   Will post the English menu now."}
{"text":"Diamonds has awesome traditional cantonese food that I cannot find anywhere else locally.  Great portions, cheap price, amazing flavors!  For years I couldnt figure out what the special flavor in the lo mein was..simply awesome!  Finally took my \"asian chef\" pal and realized it was an extremely hot wok that they were cooking in, giving a smoky flavor to my \"fried\" noodles...go figure!   Now that bad...this place is not for the faint of heart...it smells and is old and has the occasional cock roach you'll see...but its very real chinese food so its all good!    Just dont look at the geoduck in the fish tanks...if youve been there, you know what I mean - LOL!  If you have not been there...google geoduck, again - LOL!  I love this place..."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic as usual. Sometimes the service is a little slow but it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place a 4 instead of 5 stars is that the ambience (very important to me) is severely lacking and for the brief funky smell that emanated from the kitchen at one point when they opened the kitchen door to bring food out to another table. I honestly thought I was going to have to leave the restaurant. However, they were bringing out DELICIOUS looking lobster, crab, and some whole fish. Smell went away after about a minute and I have no idea what in the world it could possibly have been coming from.   We ordered Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao chicken and a vegetarian mushroom dish. All were SUUUPER tasty! and very inexpensive.  Lobster is $10 a pound. Not sure how much the crab is but will probably try lobster next time I go. Definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"I love the run down family ran hole in the walls; they usually make some of the best food around, while Diamond's isn't the best around, its certainly solid authentic style Chinese cooking. Look around, you'll probably be the only non-ethnic diner in the place which is a very good sign. On our visit the place was busy with Chinese and Asian customers, Id say they are far more discerning than most and the harshest critics if it's horrible.   They do offer the American style dishes I strongly recommend that you not even look at that menu. So first things first, ask for the Chinese/Vietnamese menu, this is where Diamond's really shines. On the back page of the menu you'll find full family style meals complete and affordable. We ended up ordering the #3 which was a huge selection of varied dishes. Dry Fried Rice Noodle with Beef, Half Roast Duck, Half Crispy Chicken, Lobster with Ginger and Onion, Whole Steamed Fish, Subgun Tofu and Chinese Broccoli with Beef, all for under $54! I felt like we were at some sort of celebration as each dish emerged from the kitchen. All the dishes were well prepared and tasty. They steamed fish as well as the lobster came right out of the tanks in the front of the restaurant, talk about fresh!  I only have a couple of gripes. I love soda pop pairings with Chinese food, the carbonation cuts through some of the oilier flavors and leave you ready to eat more. While Diamonds does serve pop, they serve it from a warm can which then poured over ice waters down the sought after carbonation. My other problem is their use of oil on some dishes. The steamed fish was cooked perfectly but then they cover it in this oily sauce that lacked flavor and simply did not add to the dish what-so-ever. If you order the fish, ask for them to not use oil in the sauce.   With so many different real deal Chinese dishes to chose from, why even both with sweet and sour pork?"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years for the great food. The problem is you will be in for a wait as there is only one cook but for us personally don't mind it cause the food is worth the wait. The prices also reflect the wait because a family of 5 can eat for around $40 which I think is really cheap. By the way the inside got a face lift with a couple of pool tables and an arcade game also a new bar but I didn't try any of there drinks so I can't review on that aspect. House lo mein and stir fry flounder are our favorite dishes oh and the orange chicken is just on point. 4 stars are for the wait"}
{"text":"Minus 1 star for atmosphere: this is your stereotypical dimly lit, slightly grubby, sticky tabled Chinese restaurant in trends of atmosphere.  Minus 1 star for service: the waitress here will argue with customers and won't change the bill if a dish comes out under cooked...  plus 3 stars for flavor: I can't get over how awesome the roast duck is.  The sauce is something to be admired and devoured.  its amazing over rice.  The fish here is also quite delicious.  prices are good and seafood is cheap.  Only complaint is that the white rice can be pretty dry and coarse."}
{"text":"When you go here, don't expect good service, ambiance, and cleanliness. But, do expect great tasting food. And you cannot beat the price also, it's considerably cheap for what you're getting. It's worth the trip just for the food. That's all I care about this place."}
{"text":"This place is a bit scary.  (And since it is a Chinese restaurant, that means a little more than scary).  It's dark, (even though its been remodeled at least once since it has changed owners a few times).  It serves mostly Cantonese based cuisine although most of the waitstaff tend to speak Mandarin.  I'm actually Chinese and notice these things.  There is some live seafood.  I usually go here for lunch when we have a crowd.  It is inexpesive and fairly quick to get in and out.  A bit heavier on the salt and sauces than I would like though.  I tend to go to my old standbys Great Wall or my newer loves Nee House or South China knowadays."}
{"text":"You know the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld? I like to keep that in mind when I do my Yelp reviews because, while the rating system is a simple one to five stars, you really aren't reviewing all restaurants on the same variables.   Diamond's needs to be rated amongst authentic discount Chinese food restaurants. I give it four stars with the understanding that Diamond's is not:  - romantic - a place to meet my girlfriend's parents for the first time - charming  Is it authentic? Maybe. How would I know? I can say that it's a value where you get a lot of good for an inexpensive price. The decor isn't impressive but they don't claim it is. Specials are written on florescent poster board lining the restaurant.   Service is slow and inconsistent though -- so less a star. But I stand firm that, if you like Chinese food and you are hungry, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Here is the breakdown... cheap authentic Chinese food. Be sure to order off the Chinese menu and not the American menu. One menu contains sweet and sour pork/chicken/beef. That's the menu for all the Americans that have never really know what the difference between Chinese food and Panda Express.  Here's is what YOU ARE NOT going to get... fast service, atmosphere and whatever you expect from a restaurant. But like I said, you get cheap authentic Chinese food.  Recommended dishs include Whole Steamed Fish, Roast Pork, Stir Fry Crab/Lobster, Steamed Flounder, Sea Cucumber, Black Sauce Clams, Beef Claypot, etc.  If you can't understand the concept above, go eat at Panda Express or PF Chang and enjoy your Sweet and Sour Chicken."}
{"text":"When ever our family is missing New York we always end up at Diamonds.  Think Mott & Bayard in China town nyc and your transported.     Anything you order will be authentic flavorful and value packed."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of  1 because they're the only remaining OG Chinese restaurant left in Phoenix.  The other two, Lucky + China Doll are long gone.  Diamond is a pretty typical Chinese restaurant from the 70's.  Red/yellow decor throughout with food served on ghetto hard plastic plates with Chinese floral designs.    In terms of food, you'd think after 30 some years of practice they'd be able to master at least the basics.  Nope! It is as bad as when I was a kid.  I guess you can say they're consistent.  A few years ago they were busted for illegally roasting massive quantity of ducks out back and shut down for a couple of months. So you can chuck sanitation right out the window.  The only reason why I come back every so often is because it brings back fond memories of dining with my grandmother."}
{"text":"Our friends wanted to try Diamond's, we wanted to eat Mexican. Wish we'd been pushier! Diamond's was just plain bad. The restaurant was dirty. The carpets, the bathrooms-- yuck. We waited 10 minutes at the table for water and menus. The food was ok, but the service and cleanliness were such that I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. Ordered the beef chow fun.  It was very good. but .....  they serve it with a dish that was badly chipped.  Look at the picture.  I also ordered the egg plant with pork hot pot.  It was serve on a plate and not in a hot pot.  It was greasy and terrible."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was little and the food is always great. Although their service is kind of crappy, the food definitely makes up for it. They have been switching owners a few time for the past couple of years and it seems like their services is going down every time I go there. Services are so bad that if I wanted a plate or more napkins and even a cup of water I have to go get it myself. The people that works there always seem to be forgetful too. I would order Dr. Pepper and I have to literally beg them each time I see the same worker for my drink. I have to flag them down to get any service. The three stars are only for the food. I would give them a five star only for the food. The food is getting more expensive every time I go over there. For a group of 3 pdopld, last year, was only about 30-40 dollars with about 6 different plates now it's about 60-70."}
{"text":"If you're looking for traditional southern Chinese food, go no further. Make sure that you get the \"Chinese menu\" it has Chinese, English & Vietnamese and is printed on pink paper. If you get the other one, ask for the pink one, unless you want lemon chicken and Mongolian beef. All the dishes are very reasonable and authentic. Great comfort food, and great prices. If you go with a group, go ahead and grab one of the set menus - a good selection at a great price. My favorites: Chinese Crispy Roasted Pork, Bittermellon w/ Beef, Subgum anything, especially the chow fun, Roasted Duck, and a nice selection of fresh sea foods. you can't get anything fresher than after ordering, the chef goes and \"catches' your meal out of the several tanks housing, lobsters, crabs, prawns, tilapia. This is not for the faint at heart, service is near the bottom of their priorities as is the decor and bathroom maintenance, but the food is perfect. If you have any doubts about the authenticity of this place - go on a Sunday night around 7pm and try to get a table. It's packed with families having their weekly get together."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is small, old school, kind of run down and a hole in the wall restaurant  but has the best authentic Chinese food ever! They have a live fish and lobster tank where you can pick your kill and they will deep fry or cook the whole thing for you. It is crispy, fresh and amazing. I've tried the lobster, fried flounder, walnut shrimp, ong choy, hot and sour soup, mongolian beef, salt and pepper pork chops and etc. I haven't had anything I didn't love. It's best to go with a group of people so you can share your big dishes family style. On top of that, the prices are amazing, and portions are big!"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. It took 10 minutes for a waiter to come and greet us with menus. We ordered and waited a whole 40 minutes. Another party sat down after us and ordered after us and they got their food before my table. We walked out. Never will come back to this place"}
{"text":"Thank God we live in America. I can't imagine that this could be the standard in another country.  I have been to next-door Los Compadres hundreds of times, but never ventured into Diamonds. It's a weird Chinese looking building, but as many times as I've driven by, I'd never gone in. Until recently.  My brother and I resolved to finally check it out. We parked in back and made our way toward the front door. There was water streaming across the driveway into the gutter, and white bits of something were strewn throughout. I didn't think much of it at the time.  When we opened the door, we were instantly greeted with the sight, sound and smell of 5 huge aquariums, all holding seafood that presumably was going to be eaten soon. I got the distinct impression that the floor hadn't been swept in three or four months.  After we made our order and sat waiting for our take out, I noticed a large brown spot on the front of the counter. Hmmm... And then it moved. Oh my god. This is the largest cockroach i have ever seen in my life. It must have been five inches long. I was mortified such that I could not find my voice. And then a second one appeared, and then a third. OMG. I finally got the manager's attention and pointed to it. She quickly moved to the front of the counter, and cupping her hand, caught it, and then scurried back to the kitchen with it.  I was going to be sick. I ran toward the bathroom, and found myself splashing through a big puddle all the way to the toilet. UGH. The toilet was already full from someone before me. So I flushed. And then came the most wrong sound you've ever heard come from a water pipe as and what was in the toilet started rising to the top. I fled and grabbed my brother by the arm.  As I squished my way back along the walkway toward the driveway, I realized what was streaming across the parking lot and into the gutter. It was raw sewage littered with bits of wet toilet paper.  Someone needs to shut this place down."}
{"text":"I ordered Steamed Fish (Sea Bass), Roast Pork with Crispy Skin, and Snow Peas Leaves, easily enough food for 3 to 4 people, the total for which came to less than $40.  This is certainly a worthwhile place to go for some authentic Chinese food at very reasonable prices.  All the food I ordered was good, especially the Steamed Fish, which was prepared exactly the way it should be. I also enjoyed the Snow Pea Leaves, which was very tasty, something new for me, and a nice alternative to Chinese Broccoli. The Roast Pork was tender, however it was not quite as flavorful, hot, and crispy as I would have liked.  I did not award four stars due to the fact that the service has been very slow both times I have been to this restaurant. Presentation was also lacking somewhat."}
{"text":"The place is uninspiring and easy to miss but the food is amazing. Ask for the Chinese menu because they have two menus which are very different. I have been eating here for about 10 years. There is no better Chinese food in Arizona and the southwest. Not the place for health nuts but if you like Chinese food you will love this place. Prices are very good."}
{"text":"The food here was very standard, nothing special or notable on the menu. Servings are large for the price but it takes horrendously long for anything to come out. We had the pork lo mein and found it hearty but bland. Friends have said the same of other options.   TL; DR - mediocre food for super low price after a long wait."}
{"text":"While my visit, to pick up take out was kind of drunken blur, the amazing food I ate from Diamond's after a few hours of harder than intended  drinking were JUST what the doctor ordered. My buddy did all the ordering, so all of it was a surprise, when I sat down to eat.  Quite possibly the best Hot-and-Sour soup I've had IN MY LIFE, and all of the everything else that was ordered, was smack yo' mama good. The fried rice, and lo-mein were divine (especially cuz it was a big diet cheat for me) and the EGG FOO YUNG = EGG FOO YUM. I've had much more bad Egg Foo Yung than I have had good Egg Foo Yung.. to the point that I never think to order it, cuz it usually SUCKS, but SO NOT THE CASE at Diamond's! The lady at the register = super cute, and I kinda like the \"stab joint\" classic chinese restaurant looks of this place.. no windows! YES! :D Five stars... the food seriously speaks for itself."}
{"text":"If you are ever in the area near phoenix, you gotta stop by here! if you crave Yummy yummy authentic Chinese food then this is the place for you. The fried lobster is delicious with just the right seasoning! you get to choose your kill and they cook it fresh for you :) The pineapple fried rice and steamed fish was tasty as well.   The place looks a little run down and old but the food never disappoints. Expect service to be a little slow like most Asian restaurants. The food also comes out pretty slow.   This place is great for big parties and family dining. I recommend if your in the area since there isn't much Asian restaurants around."}
{"text":"I used to go here in the late 80s when I worked nearby. Once upon a time, this was a cleaner, classier and busier restaurant than it is today. Last week I was in the area and decided to give it a try.  To be truthful, it looks dreary inside, but the restaurant was vacant except for me till almost the end of my meal. The waitress didn't seem very welcoming when I first walked in, but I decided to smile and after that she was nice enough to work with. Aside from the lack of ambience, the food was outstanding. I ordered shrimp with mixed vegetables, it came with steamed rice.  There was plenty of shrimp and plenty of vegetables.  In fact it was a great deal. With tax and tip, I was out the door at $9. I'll definitely go back. Tasty, very generous portions and very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Not even sure where to begin.  BAD.  VERY BAD.  Most of the meats were a gray color, the hot and sour soup was mustard yellow somehow...and we waited FOREVER for bad food.  After we'd waited thirty minutes, the waitress came out and said they did not have any more of the entree we ordered.  That took you 30 minutes to figure out?  And let us not forget the decor!  Wait, that's mean...there was NO decor so no need to comment on that!  NEVER, EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Oh my god, please don't make me eat here ever again.   When I first moved into the neighborhood I made it a choice to check out the local restaurants. Overall, I was very pleased with the half a dozen restaurants that occupy 7th Ave between Indian School and Camelback. Then, I tried Diamond's.   Where to begin? Okay, so you walk in and the first thing you may notice is: filth. Now, I'm no fancy pants, and I love some dive joints, but this is just too far. Dirt and stains on \"cleaned\" tables, multiple open fish tanks that stink up the whole place, trash on the floor, questionable odors galore, dirty silverware. Oh.My.God.   I try to be brave. I order some food - sweet & sour something or another. The sauce? It's goo. Like thick, gooey goo. I am so grossed out by whatever I am eating and the filth surrounding me that I find myself unable to eat. Again, I have eaten in my share of one-star restaurants, but none have been this bad.   It's odd, because I've heard so many good things about this place. I honestly don't know what is going on because there is no way this could be the same place people are raving about. I know the prices are good, but hey - eating out of a dumpster is free, so why not just go there? I don't know, maybe I'm a snob. Maybe I went there on an \"off\" day. Maybe it deserves a second shot to be sure, but honestly, there is no way I could ever set foot in this place again.   I ended up paying the check and running across the street to America's Taco Shop for a few margaritas to try to wash away the memories."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I went by this place many times it seemed like it was closed. I finally stopped by, There was still no one there, I went in anyways just to check it out. I was the only one in there and ordered the sesame chicken. The food was delicious and the proportions were enormous for $4.50! Apparently the people who are writing bad reviews on this restaurant are full of it! I highly recommend this place, the quality of food is great and the  prices are great!"}
{"text":"It's a nice hole in the wall restaurant and we ordered the family style package and added shark fin soup. I loooooved the steamed fish. The soup was okay, the lobster was good, the clams was good, but I didn't like the roasted pork at all. It was fatty and tough to eat, and it was the last dish to arrive.   I ordered hot tea to drink but they only have oolong, and the tea wasn't hot, just slightly warm.   The server wasn't terrible, but wasn't very friendly either. Maybe a family of the owner. She said thank you as we were leaving but i think she really tried to avoid any opportunity to converse with us. There may have been a language barrier there."}
{"text":"Love it!  The place is not your usual Chinese restaurant with soft lights and lot's of decorative ornaments;  it's rather bleak,  with loud fish tanks, but the good news is that the tanks are full of fresh seafood! Making for the most wonderful tasting dishes.  We enjoyed all we ordered. We had the Hot and Sour soup, which was loaded with yummy noodles and pieces of chicken and shrimp.  Then we shared the sampler platter which was very good.  The sweet and sour chicken was perfect and all the sauces were yummy.  Prices are reasonable and portions very large. We had lots left over,  and took home \"doggy bags\". We definitely will return for the awesome food. Don't expect \"fast food\" or fancy trimmings,  but do try the place if you like authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"$35 buy you black beans clams, steam fish topped with shredded ginger, ginger & onion lobster, and no charge on rice!  You might find this type of deal in New York, Cali or Chicago, rarely in Arizona.       I felt I grew up with this restaurant.   My family has been coming here for years.  It has been so many years that I have back.   I was really impressed with the consistency of the dishes.  Everything still tasted delicious.  If you want authentic Chinese food, do not order from the regular menu; ask for the Chinese one with English translation.  You will not be disappointed!   The clay pot beef tendon/stew (the gravy goes well with other dishes if you don't like the meat) and pea seedling/Dou Miao with garlic sauce are a must try.  *** Note*** Go here knowing that you'll get good and affordable food, but find the service and ambiance lacking."}
{"text":"I was searching for an authentic chinese food restaurent instead of all the other buffets and fast food chinese restaurants that are a dime a dozen when I found reviews on Diamond's Chinese Restaurant.  For the most part the reviews were accurate. I have to say that the food was amazing!  I do agree with some of the prior critics that the ambience is not so great, and there is a not so pleasing smell when you walk in. But I can't emphasize enough that the food was absolutely delicious and to top it off they give very very generous portions. I was not aware of this and my husband and I ordered entirely too much food. We literally walked out with 3 to go plates! I would definately dine again here and I would  recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Chinese food and does not care about ambience."}
{"text":"This place is what I remember it 20 years ago.. different owners now.but great food. The prices, can't be beat. Whole roasted duck was delicious. 14 Dollars???  Wow.lobster was what I remember as a kid..   the place is not clean, but off you have ever been in Hk or China??? ... Pretty close..will be bk when I a ever back over there"}
{"text":"This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant.  I am not rating it on its pnash - it has none.  This is a restaurant and food as you would find it in China.  I love the food and have had many of the dishes.  This stuff is great.  Be warned, there are people that have difficulty getting over some of the textures, decor and presentation, but I love this stuff.  Amazing and exotic."}
{"text":"You have to order off the authentic menu... and you have to ask for it.  Salt/pepper shrimp is the best we've ever had.       It's definitely a dive.  I've never seen filth, but it's certainly not clean either.   Don't go on a holiday; they can't handle crowds.  We usually go for early dinner on a Sunday- and there are only a few people and the food is THE BEST.  Great vegetable dishes, too!"}
{"text":"Finger licking good with great Scallion Ginger Lobster at $16.95.  They also have live seafood in the tank at decent prices.  It is a huge improvement than last time so we will be back.  This place rivals many elite seafood giants of LA Chinese enclaves."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by stating a few facts.  #1 My boyfriend and his family are Chinese, and they were dining with me.  #2 The aforementioned Chinese people in my party ordered everything for us in the spirit of authentic Chinese cuisine.  #3 I put on a happy face and ate as much rice as I could to fill up.  :)  I like to start any decent meal with a good hand-washing, especially when eating with my Chinese in-laws when they're in town from China.  I went into the bathroom at Diamond's, and I almost hurled.  I am a mortician and around putrid smells every day of my life, so for the smell of a bathroom to turn my stomach is reeeally saying something.  I felt obligated to stay and eat.  I left the bathroom and used antibacterial hand sanitizer instead.  :(  So the food began to appear.  We ordered a big pot of oolong tea to accompany our meal.  We were warned that it, along with the glasses of water on our table, was tap water.  The steamed white rice was fine and dandy, and I ate most of it.  We got dungeness crab, served chopped up but still in the shell and smothered in a brown gravy sauce that was none-too-tasty and killed the delicious crab taste.  We also had lobster that was similarly served chopped into pieced and smothered in sauce, with the meat still inside.  This method of serving made it difficult to handle the food without getting your hands dirty, including serving it to yourself from the lazy susan.  We also had cod with all the bones in it and the eyeballs still in its head, completely intact.  I did not even taste it, as I've had some bad experiences with fish bones.  The rest of the table ate the whole thing, including the fish brain and eyeballs and cheeks.  *shudder*  Just a matter of personal preference, but I can't do that.    All in all, I would never go back.  Ever.  And I'd advise anyone with a weak stomach or a strong sense of smell to avoid this place at all costs.  Again, this is simply my preference and opinion.  But I like to taste my food, not just the seasoned gravy thrown onto it.  And the smell... oh good heavens!  Check please!"}
{"text":"If you want good authentic Chinese food at very reasonable prices, look no further.  Is this place shiny and fancy?  No, but I've been to many a hole in the wall where they serve terrific food.  This place is no exception.  I don't know if I've had a bad dish here.  The selection is large if you know what to order.  Many items are not on the American menu.  The live seafood is awesome and it is cooked to perfection however way you please.  We have also ordered a whole roasted sucking pig here on several occasions for the holidays."}
{"text":"First time eating at Diamond's Chinese Restaurant, we were very not impressed by the inside of the restaurant. We were the only table in the restaurant, might be because it was Saturday downtown on Memorial weekend. We ordered the only two stir fried noodle dishes on the Chinese version menu. By the way, they also have a Vietnamese version and American version menu. The flavor of the two dishes we ordered was great, the portion was gigantic. One of the best fried noodle dishes in Phoenix, I am a big fan of noodle."}
{"text":"Delish! Stopped in for dinner one night. The building is old and can be hard to miss, but there's plenty of parking once you find it.  We had the Chinese broccoli with beef, which was a little salty but excellent. I love the flavor on the beef and the crisp green broccoli. The lobster was wonderful, with a lot of nice ginger flavor and a thick, tasty sauce. My favorite was the salt and pepper shrimp. Lots of fresh green and white onions, with extremely spicy little peppers that gave the entire dish a great kick. The accompanying rice didn't seem fresh, but the portion was big.  The restaurant is old, dirty, and smelly, so don't go in expecting a ton of ambiance. Our server was really nice, packed up our leftovers, and waved to us as we were leaving. If you want authentic, tasty Chinese, stop in, but beware that this place isn't for everyone."}
{"text":"THIS WAS THE BEST CHINESE I EVER HAD HANDS DOWN. Incredible food.  But they have closed down..... I'm so saddened to see wonderful local businesses close such as this."}
