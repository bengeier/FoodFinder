{"text":"This location changed ownership in 2010 and has really gone downhill. The quality of food and service is down while the price is up. The Northwest location is a much better choice."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business? 
My friend wanted to go here for her birthday, since she is able to eat there even with a peanut allergy. 

Our server was totally disinterested in doing his job. From neglecting to take one of our orders, to taking 45 minutes to bring the drinks, everything about our server was terrible. The restaurant was not busy, he was not stressed, he just did not care. 

On top of all that, the cheesecake wasn't even good!"}
{"text":"Big comfortable booths, dim lighting, a cozy atmosphere, and a large menu is what you'll find at the Cheescake Café. I've had lunch here with friends many times and I keep coming back. This time around, I ordered the California Chicken Burger (a firegrilled chicken breast topped with smoked bacon, smoked Gouda cheese, fresh guacamole, radish sprouts, spinach leaves, and tomato) and it was awesome - one of the best burgers I've had. The service was also good. There's no doubt that I'll be back another day."}
{"text":"The food is incredibly overpriced, on par with Earls and Cactus Club pricing with far less quality. The waitress brought me the wrong type of pasta after I specifically requested a different type, and even had a conversation about it with her while ordering. Although it didn't take long for it to be fixed, I would expect that at the prices they are charging we would atleast receive a free desert. The table behind us received a free desert after experiencing a similar situation but we were never offered this. The food was less than mediocre and was not worth the $20 price tag. We ordered the Oreo cheesecake which wasn't even all cheesecake because it was three quarters sheet cake which was filled with a bit of cheesecake. In addition, all of the doors in the women's bathroom were broken and didn't lock. The prices are insane for the poor quality of the food and the even worse quality of the atmosphere. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Hade a BBQ burger and iced tea. The tea was .... Well.... Cold. Just canned iced tea, it tasted like. The burger was dry and bland. Also had the clam chowder. It was watery and tasteless. Cheesecake cafe is good during weekday lunch when they are not busy. It is a good place for families who don't want to cook and are hungry. The only saving grace are the 13 little takeout cookies for $2. I am sure the cheesecake is good, but I don't eat sweets like that too much."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!  This had to be one of the worst meals I have ever had and grossly overpriced at that.  A small piece of very dry, tasteless salmon (was supposed to be curry marinated, but I could not taste any curry, some rice that was inedible and 6 spears of steamed asparagras that arrived cold for $19.50.  Not even any ambiance that would justify the price.  After the horrible meal, I was afraid to try the cheesecake.

I'm guessing that the 5 star reviews posted here were written by the owner."}
{"text":"There is a reasonable selection of desserts.  We tried three of them.  Presentation is fair.  Service was fine.  The flavour was decent, though there was nothing that stood out as more than decent.  The restaurant was busy, which is good for them.  We don't have plans to return as there was nothing there in terms of food or atmosphere that would motivate us to return to this restaurant in particular."}
{"text":"This place used to be great in the 90's. The salads used to be fresh and tasty, with what tasted like home made dressing.  Now the Salads are no better than the pre packaged ones you buy at Safeway. The server was very inattentive. The child's meal was substandard to a McDonald's Happy Meal at twice the price. The cheesecake was OK, nothing fabulous."}
{"text":"We get great service here.  The food is OK.  They changed the menu so much and took out a lot of stuff that we liked.  Their salads are pretty plain and boring.  They don't have much for appetizers.  

Their cheesecakes and cakes are dry yet expensive and the cut is smaller.  They waited for me to complain about the size of my cake and said \"ya I thought it was a small piece\".  I don't even get them anymore as I can make it better at home with my box mix.  It is what you are named after....hello?

We get their burgers and fish'n'chips.  Their beer is expensive.  They need to do something as they are getting lower and lower on our list of places to go."}
{"text":"I love the cheesecake Cafe. The food here is Soo good especially there amazing cheesecake. They have the best cheesecake in  Calgary wouldn't wanna go anywhere else. The people are really friendly that work there"}
{"text":"I only come in here for cheesecake, so I can't make a judgment on their food menu as I haven't tried any of it. I absolutely love cheesecake, and I love their Turtle cheesecake. So rich and chocolatey, and they actually give you a pretty generous sized slice. I've always had really friendly servers, and upon reading some other reviews, it appears I've been pretty lucky in that department. It's a big dining room, and when it's very busy, you may go a while without seeing your server. One time, our server had a 13 top sit down right after she took our order, so it took longer than usual to get our coffees and cheesecake. She was sweet and apologetic, but we weren't in a hurry and having worked in the industry, I get how tough it can be with large groups. No big deal! One thing they should work on though is discussing work matters privately. When we were waiting for a table, a server and the manager got into a very heated argument in front of the hostess stand. That was pretty awkward! Otherwise, a good place when your sweet tooth needs to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Alright, review number 2.... One thing that was noticeable right off the bat was it was warmer in the restaurant. 

Our server was very kind and attentive but slightly forgetful.. we knew she was busy so it was forgivable. 

Boyfriends mom had the steak sandwich, he had the jambalaya and i had the mushroom pasta. 

A steak sandwich is a steak sandwich, its hard to mess up. The steak was cooked perfectly but came with a MOUND of onions on it that were barely cooked all the way through and were overly salty. Otherwise she was satisfied with her meal. 

My mushroom pasta was great. I played it safe after our last experience and went with something I know probably comes out of a bag. 

Now, his jambalaya.. it was basically mushy rice and red sauce. Not good Cheesecake.. not good. Jambalaya's are supposed to be spicy and vibrant and colourful. This one barely had any veggies or meat or seafood, it wasn't spicy in the least and the rice was way overcooked. Boyfriend loves spicy and was disappointed.. although he struggled to stomach it he somehow did. 

Again the experience was an overall OK.. but the kitchen obviously needs to taste their food before sending it out."}
{"text":"Expensive food with terrible service food was awful and old I have no idea how this place is still in business!"}
{"text":"Went to the Cheesecake on 36st N.E. last night and had a great time. Since it was Wednesday the place was less than half full at 6:30pm and the five of us were seated right away.

Our server was absolutely wonderful and very friendly. It could be because she was only serving around two other table s at the time but , hey, who would complain.

I had the lazy shepherds pie ( I'm still a sucker for shep pie). I did'nt know what the \"lazy\" meant, but apparently the meat is on one side of the plate and the potatoes on the other. It was like chopped beef ( not the usual ground beef you get in most pies) so more or less it was meat and potatoes not a traditional shepherds pie. it was very very tasty though. Mmmm goodness and I would certainly order that again.

My wife had the spinach cheese stuffed chicken and  potatoes, our friends had linguine and some chirzo pasta thing. They all raved about it and were defiantly satisfied with their choice.

Of course they all saved room for CHEESECAKE and it all went over very well. Had to take half of it home of course.

This time around it was one of our better experiances at the Cheesecake cafe. We have had some issues with the service a few times in the past, but this time they did everything right."}
{"text":"Only go here for Cheesecake. The food is really mediocre reheated type nonsense that isnt really \"cooked\" per say. 

Their cheesecake is downright amazing though. Good dessert place, bad restaurant."}
{"text":"Here's the thing: they have those nice free cookies. So they get a star for that.
On the downside, everything else about this place is absolutely terrible


Last time I was there I had the grumpiest waitress on the planet serve us. She didn't even talk to us after our orders were made: I asked for a refill on my drink and she fiercely grabbed my drink, brought back a new one and slammed the glass down on the table with the night of Thor's hammer.

The glass was filthy by the way

My eggs Benedict was freezing cold and the hashbrowns were super greasy

Bad"}
{"text":"Its been awhile since I have been here last and dont know if I will be back again. Bigger plates, Bigger Price, less food.  Dont know what happened in the past few months but the waiter\"s service was about the highlight for this visit.  Might keep this place for a coffee and dessert night out."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning at about 11 am. When we first arrived, we weren't sure what to expect as there were only about 3 other tables and an empty restaurant usually isn't a good restaurant. The food was quite good, however, and our server was awesome. I had a couple of cups of coffee, and it is a rich high-quality coffee which really makes the meal much better. I also ordered a side of hollandaise and a side of hot sauce, and wasn't charged for either (that is rare these days). We were also given some complimentary mini bannana bread muffins while we waited for the food - NICE TOUCH!!! I had \"Joe's Special,\" which is ground beef, onions, spinach, cheese, and cheese all mixed together. It was good but i'm not sure I would get it again (I would prefer another meat in there instead of the ground beef). It was still quite good though. The rye toast that came with it was outstanding, i wonder if they make that in-house. The portions are also HUGE, I actually left food on my plate which is rare for me as I'm a big eater. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"To be honest... I was expecting a lot of different types of tees in the place. Prices pretty high. We ordered tee and cheese cake. Cakes are great, but tea was cold."}

Would like to go back for the food one day."}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Cafe: AKA, the Celebration Night Ruiner.

My sister invited her friends and I to celebrate an occasion here with her son. It was a Friday night at about 6pm and the place was packed, but the wait for a table wasn't long. 

That was the only wait that wasn't long. After we ordered drinks from the waitress, she would disappear and come back every 45 minutes or so. The only thing that kept us complaining about that, was that no one wanted to spoil the night for my sister by pointing it out. Our drinks came to the table lukewarm after sitting on a counter for the better part of an hour and half an hour after we ordered food. When the waitress set them down and asked us what else we would like, my nephew muttered loudly enough for everyone to hear that he would like some food. She replied that it would be another 20 minutes and then practically ran away from our table. When I looked over occasionally to see where she was, she was either hiding in a booth or flapping her gums away with staff.

Over an hour later and two and a half hours after we had been seated, our cold and congealed food finally arrived. It had been ready for ages, but had been sitting under heat lamps while waiting for the waitress. Not the kind of state you expect your deep fried food to be in. It was so unappetizing that we sent it back. It showed up on the bill anyway. Despite all this, my sister wanted to leave the waitress a tip. A tip for what? I talked her out of it.

We left hungry and contemplating Denny's. I went home and consoled myself with leftover mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"a traditional western restaurant. food is cook right, staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This place used to be very good, but has slid since recently. It's not terrible, but lacks anything special. The service was not all that great as after our food was served we had to hunt down the server to get salad dressing as our salad came with none. Our pasta was no better than some of the microwave pasta's I've had for lunch. So nothing really wrong here. Just paid $50 for a lunch I could have put together myself at safeway for about $10 or less."}
{"text":"This is the perfect bistro to have brunch. They have a good menu, and their French Onion Soup is my favorite from among other places. They sell a good variety of cheesecakes too. But what I dont like from this place is that it's old and looks like it hasn't been renovated for years,  orders take too long to arrive, probably bc they have a few servers- eben at peak hours. Still recommending this place though."}
{"text":"Worst service and food. 20 min to get drinks. Forgot our waters. Forgot to bring out 2 of our orders. No cutlery. No ketchup. Asked for peanut butter, never came. Asked for more coffee, never came. I'm lactose and the hash browns had cheese, I expressed that I'm lactose, no offer to fix the problem. One order was a Sante Fe wrap. Says guac was in it, didn't come in the wrap, that was expressed, no discount or offer to fix the problem. I guess going to a place called the Cheese Cake Cafe we should of stuck to cheese cake.. Which I can't have. Wouldn't recommend this place. Expensive and terrible food/service."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Cafe

Calgary's version of Cheesecake factory.  

I just want to tell you I gave them a 3 because they took the battered mushroom off their menu and re-vamped it to this new type of stuffed mushrooms that has a cream cheese mixture, changed the mushrooms and added this avocado puree sauce.  YUCKY  I was sooooooooo sad but then in the end the server advised me you can still order the old style, you just have to tell them ................ thank god, next time I'm ordering the old school style. 

Myla and I started off with deep fried pickles and corn dogs Tapas.  Pricing good and food was great as well. The corn dogs were made in a home made batter and vienna sausages were used,  A nice salt and sweet batter mix. I don't like pickles but Myla said they were great. 

For lunch Myla had a Steak Salad?!?!?!  sorry I can't remember the name but the portion was large. It came with steak, boiled eggs, tomatoes, lettuce, friend onions and that's all I can tell from the picture I took.  She didn't complain and it she ate most of it so I'm guessing it's good. 

I had a mushroom cheddar soup loaf -- yummy, lots of cheese and the sour dough bread made everything yummy. I also had the stuffed mushrooms.  I ate 2 out of the 4.  I was NOT happy with the re-vamped menu :( 

For dessert- I love their COOKIES  1.99 for 13pcs  and then asked for some bernard callebaut chocolate and dip the cookies. So good.  We got the special: red velevet cheesecake/cake and the lemon rasberry cheesecake. SO gooooooooooooooood. 

Overall happy except for the mushrooms!!"}
{"text":"The ambience was nice, very quiet. Servers were pleasant though they forgot to give us cutleries- which was a strange cause its the first thing thats given. The food was decent though I didnt find anything special when it comes to taste."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the famlily Wednesday night.  We had a good time, all the meals were tasty, wait staff was great!  Hadn't been here in years, a very clean, family friendly restaurant.  We'll like start to frequent it, prices were reasonable and food was very good.  Not your typical big box restaurant!"}
{"text":"I long ago swore off Cheesecake Cafe...  expensive food and poor execution.   I was a little iffy when Hubs wanted to try their YYC Hot Chocolate fest entry (Raspberry cheesecake) but it was his pick and we went.   I felt like I had to order something so I ordered tuscan flatbread and him chicken strips to give the food another chance too. 

The hot chocolate was boring but not an issue per say but the food and service made me angry for even agreeing to come back here. 

My tuscan flatbread was SWEET.  I love sugar but it almost gagged me like someone used sugar instead of salt.     My husband's chicken strips were a tiny bit of dried out chicken,  a sugery yellow watery liquid (dip?) and a plate of fries.    He couldn't eat the sauce and the chicken was pretty terrible on it's own.    The fries were ok... but didn't make it a $13 dish. 

As for service we were basically an annoyance to our server.  Maybe because we didn't order a lot and she was more interested in the other tables that would have had bigger bills to tip on?    We also had the pleasure of having additional entertainment which was 3 other staff members complaining about customers as they did additional tasks 2 feet away from us for maybe 30 minutes.   Customers shouldn't hear about this stuff..  period.  Much less have their whole dining experience be about that.   Honestly I felt invisible to the staff here. 

On a positive note.... it's better than last time!  Back before chips and pins at the table,  my server doctored my tip line and gave herself a 40% tip when it was closed out on my credit card. Management handled that well though... and the money was returned to me.  This \"improvement\" is still not saying much for the restaurant and I'm not surprise the franchise dissolved a few years back,"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with mediocre service. Although a lot of people enjoy it. They have many choices of cheesecake for those who love deserts. They are rich and not bad. A good place for a family get together or a mellow party."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary for 3 reasons:

1. The free cookies when you arrive - while you're waiting for a table, they have these little bite sized chocolate chip cookies that are to die for...seriously, they're so small and delicious...mmmmmm!

2. Their menu - they have pretty much anything you could ever want. Salads, pizzas, asian food, pasta, sandwiches, etc etc etc...I love it here. I get something different everytime I go and I'm never dissapointed. And some of their portions are really big so definitely get some of the wrapped up so you still have some room for #3

3. The cheesecake - as their name implies, they have cheesecake. Lots of flavours and it's all delicious :)

Great date restaurant too - and the booths are super comfy!"}
{"text":"I've only ever had dessert here but we wanted to try something new. Was very pleasantly surprised by the food. It was absolutely delicious. Their soup was great. Tried French onion and broccoli cheddar. Had a sandwich which was excellent! Friend decided to try the chicken strips which were more chicken nugget like however. Also got the pan bread with the olive oil and vinegar dip, I think the person preparing that one was new as they has put the dip in a bowl instead of spread out on the plate like it should be but no big deal easy fix!  Overall very happy and will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"I have to dock a single star here, and it's important enough that I've chosen to start my review with it.  My first visit to The Cheesecake Cafe in Calgary was at this location.  It was horrible.  Just an all around terrible experience.  But every subsequent visit (and there have been many, evidenced by my increasing stomach) has gone extraordinarily well.  So I mention it first, so it's not the last thing you read.

My review is focused on 3 things; service, food, desert.  On the service front, The Cheesecake Cafe has been consistently good and occasionally great.  The servers are always friendly and the orders show up as requested.

As far as food is concerned, The Cheesecake Cafe is actually pretty good.  I have dined here on a few occasions without the intent of enjoying desert, based solely on the quality of the food.  Granted, nothing really stands out on the menu in my eyes, but the food is always prepared well and tasted good.

Now for my favourite part, desert.  I believe I have had all of their cheesecakes.  At least I hope so.  No, wait, I hope I haven't.  One more excuse to go back.  The cheesecake here is fantastic, which I suppose it should be given it's namesake.  But still, I've been to places with BBQ in the name that butcher the idea behind BBQ, so it still means something.

My favourite?  Cheesequake.  Who wants to meet me there later for desert?  Seriously."}
{"text":"After being seated were had to wait 30 minutes until someone noticed us. Terrible service!!!  They have the lowest quality food. Even their cakes taste terrible. Overall, a very unpleasant experience!"}
{"text":"So, New Years Day. A little worse for wear, a bit tired, needing some grub to get us through the day. A friend tossed out the Cheesecake cafe as a potential place, so to the cheesecake cafe we went. I totally regret it. Two days prior, I had a delicious sushi meal for about $25 including tax and a good tip. My $30 lunch was: an entree, a massive slice of cheesecake and coffee.

Okay, let's start with the coffee. I needed some coffee, and I'm a bit of a snob. I don't really trust the Cheesecake cafe with making a decent cappucino, so I got a cup of coffee. A little mug of coffee. It was three dollars. It wasn't even a tall at starbucks. Maybe it was a never-ending cup, I don't know. The server never asked if I wanted a refill.

My friends and I all ordered from the lunch menu. Some of the food looked okay, but mostly it seemed pretty mediocre. My friends \"deluxe mac and cheese\" was one of the tiniest portions I've ever seen. My fish and chips... Well, I could have defrosted them myself for ten dollars less. They were awful.

So I tried to figure it out. Why are they charging so much? It's definitely not for the decor. The decor was lacking to say the least. Country time cheesecake cafe, with crummy booths and fake kitschy decor. Ew. Just ew. It wasn't very appealing. At least when I pay through the nose at Earls the food and decor make it an experience. This was just crap.

The cheesecake was good, but smothered in a layer of fake tasting icing. Tres gross. And it was massive. And eight dollars. And no one could agree on what to share so we each got our own slice. Nope, sorry, not worth eight bucks. The service was decent, our server was friendly but a little occupied, but... Not worth it either. None of it was worth it. 

Now, don't get me wrong. I don't mind paying a lot for good food, IF IT IS WORTH IT. Only in the cheesecake cafe's wildest dreams would anything, even their eight dollar slice of cheesecake (guys, come over to my place if you want real cheesecake) be worth the amount they are charging. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Visited this location last night with some friends from the phillipines in town to visit.. my wife and I arrived about 15 minutes prior to our friends so we got a table... We sat there until our friends arrived nobody even asked us if we wanted a drink or appetizer... We sat there for another 10 minutes with our friends until finally I asked if anybody worked there... At that point the waiter came over and was kind of rude.. we ordered 3 bar drinks two iced tea and a water which we waited another ten minutes for and then he showed up without one of the iced tea... Food was average-at-best service the worst I've encountered in a long time.. it would be different if it was busy but it was 1/3 full.... Will never return..."}
{"text":"Whenever we're in the area looking for dessert this seems to be the first place that comes to our mind. I've only ever been here for dessert, and often times we get to the restaurant near closing time, but the staff have always been kind and respectful about it. There's never any pressure to kick us out. 

The last time we visited, we had their eggnog cheesecake and blueberry cheesecake; both very satisfying with nothing too special about them. Portions are generous and we opted to take the remainder of both slices home.

Great last minute idea for those craving for dessert in the area."}
{"text":"After years of never visiting The Cheesecake Cafe, my friends and I decided to give it a shot. The evening started off with not being seated for five minutes, and not being served for an additional 10. Once we received our cheesecakes, three out of the four of us did not enjoy ours. This was probably the worst cheesecake I have had in a restaurant, which is extremely disappointing for a place that is supposed to specialize in it. Not a fan of the fake taste, overly sweet, and neon colored cake. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Meh.
I don't think that I'd choose to come here again.
Nothing memorable.
Ordered Moules Frittes and it was definitely not that!. and it was kinda gross.
Yea, I know I probably should haven't ordered it anyways at cheesecake.

There is a 'happy hour' where tapas are 1/2 price.... but yeah...

Service was also slow... at 5pm...  yeah..."}
{"text":"I can't be vindictive for one incident in the few times I've come here, but it definitely left a sour taste in our mouths and strengthened my overall dislike of the place. We were here last night after deciding we were in the mood for dessert - our fault I suppose, there must be other better options for four people on a Saturday night - and it was all decent, the Saskatoon berry cheesecake I had was tasty and stomach-destroying, as any good cheesecake should be. We got there close to 10:30, maybe a bit late, but it's Saturday night! It's a chain restaurant! Their door says \"10:00 am - CLOSE\" (and I will emphasize this CLOSE in a minute) everyday! Whatever, we go in and order.

We were sitting around chatting, as we are wont to do, the conversation veering wildly from topic to topic. We were at a booth near the window, and there was another couple, our age, at a booth adjacent to us: the rest of the place was deserted. We didn't comment on this, and I figured it was a slow night. Lo and behold, 12:30 am, a hostess we never saw before comes up and kindly informs they've been closed for half an hour, so could we \"please....\" We meekly, confusedly, start getting ready as she moves on to the couple and says the same thing: \"we've been closed for half an hour, so please...\" The guy takes it like a man and storms out after delivering a strong tirade about the hostess being rude and unacceptable, etc. It reverberates quite well in the empty restaurant and leaves a thick tension in the air.

Outside, I look at the door again and notice their closing time is, simply, \"CLOSE\". Lesson learned, it's apparently midnight! I've been to this place before and the food has never been good enough to come back to. The cheesecake is good but overpriced, Ken's coffee was three dollars (a price not even Starbucks charges for a simple tall coffee), and Kat's small glass of milk cost the same as a 4 liter jug would at Superstore. The hostess can \"please...\" us all she wants, but she only earned a disappearance of any future patronage. Just desserts, Cheesecake Cafe!"}
{"text":"Ok, I want to give this place a great review.  The service was ok.  It was a nice touch to have little cookies at the front entry while waiting for a seat.  The dessert cakes look absolutely yummy.  The portions are incredibly huge. So what's not to like?

Well, Cheesecake Cafe proves that you can't always trust your eyes.  The desserts have been uniformly bland every time I've been there.   It's almost like there's a sugar shortage or something.  Worse, some of the cakes, I would swear it was made from an instant mix or something.

The savory side, they have a fascinating menu of old home standards like meat loaf and the like.  I've had the meat loaf, a burger and a soup in a bread bowl.  They are all decent, but nothing too exception to right home about.  If anything, it's very much the type of food I might expect out of Denny's really.

The only thing I can say is especially outstanding would be the ice cream sundaes.  THey're just huge, and made well."}
{"text":"Best cheesecake flavour? We asked many but finally trusted our hostess who was cleaning the table next to ours. We ordered the pumpkin praline, which is in season right now, and the salted caramel apple cheesecake. She was right. The salted apple cheesecake was the best. They were apples baked right into it and the salty caramel sauce was the perfect balance of salty and sweet. The cheesecake was like eating a warm apple treat. 

The pumpkin was more delicate. We got hints of cinnamon and nutmeg and if you love pumpkin pie this is the one to try.

The cappuccino was just OK. Lazy thin foam on top and flavor was Folgers quality. 

But the restaurant is clean. The menu looks pretty good, probably very high in calories so don't fool yourself. I don't think this place deserves three stars, so I'm giving it four. I think it's a good spot for a late night cheesecake and coffee."}
{"text":"Review #13 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

I think things used to be better at the Cheesecake.  It seems they hire really young servers (I used to be a server too, ok) but that think everything is a joke and don't really care about their job.  

When I was there, there was no management to be seen and the 3 servers there were messing around and joking while cleaning and not helping customers. 

The server we had did not seem to know the menu very well and when asked what could be made without eggs and dairy from the vegetarian options she suggested a plain salad. I asked if she could check with the kitchen as I didn't want a plain salad. Finally she came back and gave me two options and so I ordered a stir fry instead. 

I have been here before and had fine experiences, so maybe coming in at 10pm isn't a good idea, but they're still open and should want to be a little more helpful instead of trying to get you to order something quick and rush you out the door. 

While their servers may be friendly, they could use some more customer service skills and knowledge about the menu."}
{"text":"The desserts are delicious!!. And the food is not bad.. Big portions...I would go back only for the desserts... The wine is good and the service very friendly.."}
{"text":"Pasta Raphael - jasmine rice instead of pasta - My fiancé and I went for dinner here last night and I must say they have the most gluten free friendly options than any other \"chain\" place in Calgary. I would have never thought of ordering a pasta item but sub rice for the pasta. Ok this might be a no brainer for seasoned Celiac's but I am a newbie and am still learning. I had the Pasta Raphael with rice and it was so yummy. Kind of like a giant plate of risotto! I am for sure going back b/c of the choices AND because the offer G Free cheescake! I didn't have any last night as I was way too full but it was nice to actually have a dessert option!"}
{"text":"The Cheesecake Cafe is nice, casual atmosphere and an ok dining experience. It made me think of friends who eat at home and have mothers that don't know a whole lot about cooking: the food is not cooked well, but there's still love.

I had the New York Steak (we're in Alberta after all!) and it had pretty decent flavour. Unfortunately I ordered medium rare and the steak was closer to medium well. My girlfriend had the Seafood Linguine and it was decent. Again, hood flavour, with an addictive quality to it, but a little lacking in actual seafood.

Cheesecake was a little gluey in texture.

The waitress also could not handle more than one table...VERY slow service...it should not take 15 minutes to get two pieces of cheesecake!

All in all, a decent, comfortable experience, but definitely not a place for those who need their food cooked with absolute perfection! Also make sure you section off a major block of time....this place will make you wait a while."}
{"text":"I will never return. I have the honey mustard chicken.  Under seasoned mashed potatoes and over cooked and under seasoned veg. The chicken was very dry and burnt. I couldn't eat it. I ate about 3 bites and even after I left I still had the charred taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Cafe is not a bad place, but you need to set your expectations right.

If you are looking for a good stake or similar - forget it. All but the cakes is at least poor, at most horrible there.

But!

But - if you have to find a family restaurant, where moms and kids will get their cakes and orange juice - and where you can still get some beer or wine, than CC is quite a good choice.

Like I said, main courses are a major down, but poutine is actually not bad at all. And they have some local beer, and not too bad wines... Well, and the cheesecakes are also good, if you are into it.

So just set the expectations right, and Cheesecake Cafe may be a smart choice. For me, it was. If just not for that horrible meat - real pain to chew. But otherwise...

And it's not expensive, you know?"}
{"text":"I think this is the only location left in calgary now. 
Me, my sis, and her fiance, friend went there last night.
We ordered appetizers. It was filling. 
My order was given wrong. I asked for 2 portions of vegies instead of baked potato. Didn't happen...
Don't ever order calamari...it wasn't cooked and doesn't look appetizing at all.
Fish and chips being 20 dollars is kinda ok...the fish is huge. 
With the sauces...if you ask you pay extra. Though they give you Uber tiny. Not enough sauce. 
The overall experience for 4 of us are mixed therefore 3 stars are awarded.
The server is very nice however not good order taker.
I would not go back there unless we win another gift card.. 
Oh...the cheesecake is good. One more thing I find the price doesn't match... both bill and price on the menu aren't the same. Example calamari was 12 in menu in the bill it was 10.50. Weird

Bottom line: so so restaurant.  Food got good portion size excluding sauces...very tiny"}
