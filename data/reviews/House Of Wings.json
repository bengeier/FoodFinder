{"text":"One of the best wings we ever had, crunchy from the outside, perfectly cooked and amazing dip. Excellent value for money.
One thing I didn't like is the smell of the empty plate we had.. 
The staff were so friendly and cheerful."}
{"text":"Wings are great. Flavourful and big wings. The sauces are good too lots of selection."}
{"text":"Good wings and sauce selection. Staff sometimes a bit slow to get your order out other than that probably some of the best wings in town."}
{"text":"Came here to catch the NFL playoffs and grab a beer. I don't normally write reviews but I was so disappointed that I feel the need to write a review. I came to the bar to watch the game like most people do but couldn't finish watching the end of the game. The bar decided to close before the game was even finished. What bar closes before the game finishes? Especially a playoff game? I had to leave with 3 minutes left in the 4th quarter which is the most exciting part of the game. Had I known I would have gone to another bar instead so I could see the final outcome of what was an nail biting game. I don't get the logic behind a bar closing before the game is even finished but I will not be coming back to this business ever again to watch a game."}
{"text":"Really grimy place, the wings were very mediocre, the management is awful they don't care about the customers or staff I even heard that they make cooks pay for food if it gets burnt or ruined (which is EXTREMELY illegal).  Very unimpressed"}
{"text":"Used to love to go there
On my last visit I ordered wings and among the wings there was a bigger piece and it was raw 
When I pointed it out to the waitress she took my soft drink off (which I did not have a problem with, my problem was other the wings ) and she said she will let the kitchen know 
I have not been back since"}
{"text":"The last Friday I went to this place with my wife for dinner. The quality of the food nothing to do with a few months ago, the don't give you any more the vegetables and the dip with the wings (if you want it you have to pay it) and they rise the prices. The service is ok but I not return any more."}
{"text":"A good amount of screens to watch the game.  The wings are average in size, and there are a good selection of flavours.  The pint selection is fairly standard."}
{"text":"Service was great but wings a bit disappointing. We had three different orders of 2lb wings as part of their Tuesday special (buy 1lb wings, get free 1lb on Tuesday with order of a drink):
1. JK47 - Their house wings; it was overly salty and not too special. For a house flavor, we expected more
2. The Sheriff - BBQ and honey mustard; flavor was lacking and did not seep through
3. Sweet Roman Caesar - Honey garlic, romano, and caesar sauce; finally hit the jackpot with this flavor! It was a bit on the flavorful side but we enjoyed it, especially relative to first two
Not sure if we would come back. Definitely had better wings elsewhere."}
{"text":"We were in the area last week and decided to check out this place.  With the kids, so like most outings, not able to try any special flavours. I think we had the Crimson? (honey/bbq), and just regular bbq. 
Probably 1 of the best wings I have ever had!  Very tasty, and very big wings.  It was Sunday 1pm, only few people there at the time.  The server was very friendly, and even gave the kids treats afterwards. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We visited recently during a two pounds for one wing night.   The wings were awesome, the service was great, and the price was even better.  I'm now a big fan of this place.  Go Wings Go.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This place is Good!  Actually the wings are great. The beer is good. The ambiance is good and the service is good. Yes so averaging all of that I end up at good. 

Don't get me wrong. I am here almost every Friday after our weekly soccer game. The great thing is that win or lose we still make it out and enjoy some fun times at this establishment. They actually give us 10% off because of the team. 

The feel of the Place is an Irish pub meets a warehouse strip mall. They have lots of soccer memorabilia hanging about and wood benches and booths. 

The true star of the show is really the wings and specifically for me, \"the chosen one\" flavour. Love these wings every time. 

Have seen some couples on dates here once in a while. Mostly teams. And they are pretty cool about people bringing their kids. 

I'll likely be here at some point every week. And if you are in the neighbourhood, swing on by, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Standard price for wings and beer.. decent size wings and many (if not too many) sauces to choose from. Service was good. Left feeling full, satisfied and drunk so I considered a good experience and will return again."}
{"text":"Small local place for some pretty good wings.  Tuesday is 2 for one.  Lots of flavors."}
{"text":"Ten times better than the university pub wings! Totally made me miss the one here because it was that good. I really like their diversity in flavor and I like it crunchy after having wings here."}
