{"text":"Moved up to the area a year ago and was soooo excited to try Bigfoot Smokehouse! I'm a big fan of Barque Smokehouse on Roncesvalles and was thrilled that there was something similar up here. After looking at the menu I was confused so I asked the sever what on the menu was smoked, she said she wasn't sure and would have to check lol! She then came back and said they had some liquid smoke i could put on my food if i wanted. This is NOT a Smokehouse!! You need to have a smoker to call yourself a Smokehouse! Obviously I was dissapointed as this was not what I expected, maybe if it was called Bigfoot Bar I wouldn't be so critical."}
{"text":"Pretty damn pleased.

Stopped in for lunch with my wife. Shared the nachos to start. Tons of fresh toppings. Good portion size. Seemed like the end of the bag for the chips. Too many crumbs. Tasty though. My wife had some sort of wrap. She said it was great. I had the pulled pork sandwich. Very good. Really nice sauce. Sweet and smokey. We both had sweet potato fries as sides. Also very good. Top notch mains.

Our beers were nice and frosty. Would like to see a few more beer on tap though.

Our server was attentive and friendly.

All in all a very nice experience.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I was expecting. And perhaps I'm just used to something different. My friend and I just needed to stop in for a quick bite to eat and we were in the middle of nowhere. The value was incredible, the food was...OK, the service was nice, the feeling and ambiance was...creepy, they had lots of TVs, the beer selection was...suburban. I will say one thing, if I ever find myself at Leslie Road and Mulock Avenue again, I'll probably look for another option."}
{"text":"This place doesn't care for it's customers.  We visited for lunch today Aug 24, 2012.  It was a disaster.  Our orders came incorrectly. We didn't get refills until we went to the bar and demanded service. When the orders were corrected (5 min later) they were cold.  The one order (poutine) was corrected by just adding cold gravy and cheese. They didn't make fresh fries so it was cold.  They charged me for the food even though I didn't eat it.  I asked to speak with the owner and he didn't want to speak with me. When I told them I wasn't paying for cold food they said I should have said something.  I did I asked for the owner who can't make time for his customers.  I paid for the bill so that I could leave.  I will never return and I hope I save people from the aggravation we had.  The manager told me every excuse in the book. We are too busy, customers need to be more patient. IT's not her fault they are understaffed.  All true it's the owners fault. He should learn to take responsibility and at least make every effort to make things right.  Poor service and poor food.  Our team will not be returning.  It's too bad, it's there loss as we go out every Friday."}
{"text":"Service was.... Okay. Others in my group seemed to enjoy their meals, I disliked mine.. Chicken parm was terrible, they DEEP FRIED the chicken and threw some cheese on it with no sauce. It was not at all what I expected. Yuck"}
{"text":"I was at Bigfoot yesterday and I enjoyed my meal and cold beer. They had wing special yesterday and it was delicious and the beer price is very cheap compare to other places in newmarket.  I will go there every Tuesday and people try there food. By the way, the server was very hot and good service"}
{"text":"Under new management ...Weekend drink special is over! To bad it gave us a reason to go there every Saturday. Good luck!"}
{"text":"On the East side of Newmarket, there are far less interesting, independent restaurants.  Kudos to Bigfoot for opening next to the newly built Audi and Volkswagon dealerships where there are so few options.  

The back ribs are my reference for any joint that claims to be a barbecue house.  A nice serving, with good flavour and sides, in a nice atmosphere, with nice staff makes for a well rounded meal.   This is a more refined  rib joint where I would take guests or clients, while Big Bone is where I would go with the guys for a quick feed."}
{"text":"I came here after working a long day down the street and was greeted with a friendly bartender as well as a few locals. The bartender recommended some wings that were great, few beers on tap and a bunch of TVs to watch any game. I was full off the special of wings and a pint but I would come back to try the ribs, pork or any of the sandwiches. I would recommend it to anybody in the area"}
{"text":"3.5 Star

Big Foot has the BEST drink specials. 

$4 any pint on draft every Saturdays and Sundays! This is like a Happy Weekend Special.. Though there are no fancy imports available but Rickard's will be A-OK for me.. And for my Yelp friend a Blonde. 

There are also enough TVs that no matter where you sit you able to watch the game. A+ for sport fans! 

The only downside is Big Foot can be depressingly quiet as during Super Bowl, there were only 4 customers watching the game. 

Monday wings are buy 1 get 1 free, maybe I will be back for some of those... But I have my eyes on that Beer Tower ($21.99), I guess I will be buying!

The deco here is modern and bartender is superfriendly.. But it doesn't matter much if I going to finish that tower all by myself..."}
