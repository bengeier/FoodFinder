{"text":"What a terrific, little find!  

This is a wonderful take-out option for fans of Indian food.  (There are a few stools, if you want to eat-in.)  

With a few visits under my belt, I haven't had anything bad, yet.  And the coriander and tamarind sauces are particularly nice.  

One of the most refreshing things about this place is the staff.  They're super-friendly and informative.

Great little place.  Good value.  Try it!"}
{"text":"You cannot be the quality, value and service at Ajax's Samosa Hut.  I'm glad I don't live in Ajax because I wouldn't be able to stay away.   The food is amazing but it is so affordable I almost feel guilty leaving with so much and paying so little.
Best kept secret in Ajax."}
{"text":"I had samosas from Samosa Hut at a party and they were so good that I had to write a review!!!
There were butter chicken and chilli chicken (taste like spicy butter chicken). These flavors were phenomenal. I would definitely visit this spot the next time I'm in Ajax. The chilli chicken is definitely spicy and has a nice kick. The flavors of both of these samosas were amazing. I would try other flavors as well because I doubt I wouldn't want it."}
{"text":"Sadly Disappointed. I had one of their 1 meat + veggie + rice combos dinners and is was not at all enjoyable. The Butter Chicken flavor was mediocre and the Chicken was very dry, the veggies were overcooked and the rice was cold. Also, prices are high and every little extra cost extra. You can dine in Indian/Pakistani for a few bucks more elsewhere in Durham and have a better experience.

I won't be a return customer."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, for sure nothing even close to real authentic samosa cant say anything about other dishes as I only tried all types of samosas, they all were really bad. At least not a place to get samosas..."}
{"text":"After moving to Ajax, we kept going back to Scarborough to get samosas for parties and stuff. Then we found Samosa Hut and we literally go there for every occasion. 

Their spinach and cheese samosas are sweet and delicious. The meat samosas are very flavourful. Everyone that has them always asks where we got them from! No dipping sauce needed, they're so good."}
{"text":"Flavors are great I asked for spicy and got spicy, Great flavors, very friendly they took the time to explain the menu  and gave me samples of different dishes it was hard to choose everything was good definitely I recommend this place.

Its only take out but is worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome, awesome, awesome place. Tried several samosas and rolls during my visit to Ontario. I grew up in Mumbai and live in the NY/NJ area, USA where there is a plethora of Indian restaurants. Of all of them, this one stands out the best. Their spicy minced lamb samosa and roll was phenomenal and out of the world. Truly spicy and intensely flavorful. I had that with the tamarind chutney/sauce. The folks who work in the place were friendly and patient to go over and explain me the 10+ different varieties of samosas. Will definitely visit the place again on my next Canada visit."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best samosas I've had! I tried their specialty samosa, goat samosa and spinach and feta samosa.  They're all amazing, specially with their spicy sauce (which is more so flavorful than spicy, it's really good). I've heard good things about their butter chicken samosa as well. I wanted to try it but they were sold out and even other customers were asking got it.  It must be one of their more popular samosas. My personal favorite is definitely the goat one. I'm so glad we have Samosa Hut in ajax for some quick samosas. Staff is also friendly. Definitely going to be a regular at that place."}
{"text":"I found Samosa Hut by fluke while at Chapter in Ajax a few months ago. I went in and bought a variety of different samosas and I was instantly hooked. Whenever I feel like treating myself to something amazing, I drive to Samosa Hut. Right now, I dream about their Butter Chicken Roti Wrap - best thing I have ever tasted! I strongly recommend Samosa Hut to anyone. I keep a menu/flyer in my car to show family and friends. One taste and you will find yourself going there forever. 
Everyone I have seen working there are all extremely friendly; great attitudes + AMAZING food = customer for life. Keep up the great work Samosa Hut!"}
{"text":"5 STARS!! Samosa Hut nailed it. I noticed a non-stop rush of customers coming in while I was there.

The restaurant is small as it is mostly meant for take-out and catering. However they do have a small table facing the entire side with the windows.

The food is displayed very nicely and organized. One section is the curries with the vegetarian options placed together, then the meat options. The other side is fried food items like samosas and rolls. There are clear and coloured name tags for each food item so you won't be confused. There are also the spicy levels (light orange, orange and red - for the least spicy to spiciest) under the food name.

You order your choice of food, and then pay at the end. Upon arriving at the outside of the restaurant, I saw 3 large posters of specials: Omnivore Combos, Carnivore Combos, and Vegan Combos. The names were very cute and drew my attention to the posters. These posters were also on the inside of the restaurant as well. The prices were very reasonable as you can get a rice combo for as low as $4.99 for lunch. We opted for the 1 meat + 1 veggie + basmati rice for $5.99 and the 4 veggie + basmati rice combo for $6.99.  

For the meat, we tried the spicy deviled chicken (very hot), and the veggie options we tried the sweet eggplant, sweet and spicy mango curry, spicy tomato and potato curry, and the Channa Masala (chickpeas). Warning to people who can't eat spicy not to order the spicy deviled chicken. It is VERY spicy but the flavour is good. The mango curry is tasty if you're going for something tangy. The spicy tomato and potato curry was okay. I found that the flavour was very interesting. The sweet eggplant and the Channa Masala were my favourite. The eggplant was sweet, as the name says, and the chickpeas were soft. 

I also ordered the butter chicken samosas (since it's their specialty) and the lamb samosas. As well as the fish roll. The samosas were very delicious and had a lot of filling inside. For the fish rolls, it was filled with potato and you can taste the fish flakiness so you know it's good stuff. 

Let me start off by saying that the portions were VERY generous. The staff in charge of scooping the food was friendly and gave thorough suggestions when I asked for his recommendation. I tried the Channa Masala (chickpeas) that he recommended and I did not regret it. it was amazingly delicious! 

I do have to say that most of their foods are mild/spicy so be prepared. I will be back and definitely recommend this place to anyone unsure of what to eat when they're in the Ajax area!"}
{"text":"The Samosa variety was unlike any other I've seen before. Love their sweet tamarind sauce and their chicken curry samosas! The service was so friendly, sincere and easy-going. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! The guys behind the counter are always patient and willing to answer any questions you have. They specialize in kothu roti and its all delicious and made fresh and served with lime. My favourite quick takeout is the 1 meat, 2 veggie combo. I usually get chili chicken, Chana and dhal. For the combo and a veggie roll it's around 10$ for a large portion. It's dangerous that this place is so close to me because I want to go back every other day!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for samosas and butter chicken. 

They have good deals, including Monday and Tuesday's $2.99 ten-piece traditional samosas with dipping sauce and pop/bottled water. Their meal prices have gone up, but they are still a good deal. $7.99 one meat + one veg with rice. 

Yummy butter chicken that isn't heavy like others. Tandoori Chicken is alright. Pumpkin curry and cauliflower curry are alright, but needs more flavour. 

It is best to go during lunch time when food is replenished more often. After lunch, food seems to sit there for a while. I had takeout for dinner and he food was dry and mushy. Not pleasant! 

The traditional samosas have a great dough with a perfectly spiced potato & veggie filling. The filling is more like a mash compared to chunky fillings from other samosa places. Also, the samosas are not greasy, so you don't feel so bad eating all ten from the toonie special! 

Good location with lots of parking. The only issue is that you can't eat inside with its few stools, so it's best to just do takeout and eat it at home. 

Remember to bring cash if you are paying under $10 because there is a $0.25 fee!"}
{"text":"Excellent samosas, with very friendly, helpful staff. I usually get the dozen specialty samosas for $10 deal. My favorites are the Spinach and Paneer, Butter Chicken, and Spicy Caramelized Onion (very spicy!). The sweet dip they have is also amazing. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Samosa Hut is delicious and cheap with a unique variety of samosas and lots of vegetarian and meat dishes. Can be inconsistent at times with food looking like it's been out too long, it always tastes good though!"}
{"text":"I think I've found my new favourite sri lankan food joint! Just a tad bit more expensive than other places but the food this place offers makes up for that with strong flavours, and generous portions.

On my first visit, I was greeted by the owner of the joint (such a friendly fellow!) who allowed my friend and I to sample some of the meats before ordering. As we tried them, he kindly explained the flavour profiles of each meat and which he would recommend for each of us depending on what flavours we typically look for. 

Their spicy devilled chilli chicken was a winner for me. As a person who likes to eat everything spicy, the name had already sold it for me but the unique combination of pepper flavours and spices that shine through in this chicken were what made my decision to settle for this one.
Their butter chicken had a unique flavour that is unlike other butter chicken dishes I've had from other places. Super creamy with a slight sweetness. This meat placed second on my list.
Third was the spicy mutton. Typical mutton curry flavours were found in this one. Just a bit of a kick, not satisfying enough for my palette but was still pretty good!
We couldn't sample the jerk tamarind chicken leg. The guy said he wouldn't hack away at a leg for us to try!. He did, however, scoop some of its sauce into a sampling cup for us to try though. The sweet and sour tamarind flavours were really strong in this one, outshining any other flavours. Delicious, but not my thing.

I settled for the spicy devilled chilli chicken kothu roti as I had been highly recommended it. On the side, I had ordered 12 of their signature samosas for $10. I got one of each of most of their signature flavours.

The devilled chilli chicken kothu roti was packed tightly into a round tin container with a generous amount of devilled chilli chicken, LARGE chunks of it! Yes! A slice of lime was also wedged in there and when squeezed over the kothu roti, compliments the dish well with a slight tang. The only downside to this dish is the wait time. The owner had warned me that it'd take some time to make. Seems like they make everything fresh to order. I waited about 25 minutes for it to be ready.

Out of their signature samosa flavours, favourites that I MUST get again include: jerk chicken, devilled chilli chicken, curry chicken, spicy minced lamb, butter chicken, and spinach and sweet cream cheese. Jerk chicken samosa is a MUST GET. One of the best samosa flavours I've had... EVER. The spinach and sweet cream cheese samosa (although the filling seemed to have bled out while baking/frying) was super sweet; I'd consider it a dessert samosa. The samosas served here have a light flaky exterior that covers a thin bready wrapping for the fillings. Each samosa is generously packed with its delicious and flavourful minced fillings. 

My friend had ordered a two meat + basmati rice carnivore combo ($9.99) with the butter chicken and the spicy devilled chilli chicken. She had asked the owner to not be shy with the sauce. He did NOT disappoint. The rice is basically bleeding the sauce. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place specializes in takeout East Indian food.

The samosas here are excellent! They come in different flavours : spinach, butter chicken, lamb, & beef. The dough they use for the samosas are so good, that they taste homemade.

Apart from somosas we had beef korma & butter chicken along with chicken biryani rice. They were all good, although I found the butter chicken too sweet. 

The place is clean & bright, and the customer service was excellent, will come again in the future for more!"}
{"text":"I already did a review for the Oshawa location, shown below.  It pretty much says it all about the Ajax location.  Except that the Ajax location has the Kothu Roti dishes.  We finally had a chance to try them...

They were AWESOME!!!!

I tried both the Devil Chilli Chicken and the Mutton.  Both were great, but the Mutton was amazing, full of flavour!  The Devil Chicken had more heat, so it all depends on what you prefer.

Hopefully the Oshawa location will start offering the Kothu Roti's soon, that is by far the best thing they have there, definitely going back for more!

Finally, a new restaurant has opened that put's the 'fun' into Indian cuisine.  Samosa Hut, a fast food Indian restaurant has arrived in Oshawa, offering both classic and fusion based menu items, and is also Halal.

The atmosphere is both clean and friendly.  A hot table welcomes you to all their offerings, along with a menu of build to order items.  Keeping in mind this is fast food oriented, some items are average or your typical fare.  However, some of their more fusion-like items are just awesome.  One item in particular is their Devil Chilli Chicken.  Hot and full of flavour, has to be the best Indian protein I've ever had.  Also enjoyed their Fusion Stir-Fried Noodle and Chili Stir-Fried Potatoes.

At the time of this writing, the restaurant just opened so not all features were available for review.  One in particular that I'm very interested in is their Kothu Roti dishes.  They have a number to choose from and are all based on shredded flatbread that has been stir-fried and mixed with various ingredients including egg, vegetables, spices and one of their proteins (chicken, goat).  All of this then topped with a fried egg.  Looking forward to trying this with the Devil Chilli Chicken as the protein.

Overall, Samosa Hut is a welcome addition to North Oshawa."}
{"text":"We got lunch from Samosa Hut yesterday, and we were very happy with what we got. We got various dishes, including the butter chicken, spicy chicken, and tandoori chicken on both basmati and biryani rice. Everything was very flavourful and well priced for what you get. The \"medium\" portion was enormous, and we were able to share it among a few people. We also got some vegetarian samosas that were very tasty as well (3 for $1).

The guys working there were very helpful, answering questions we had. I'd happily go back there for a quick lunch in the future. 

There's nowhere to sit, it's purely a takeout joint, but we were in and out very quickly."}
{"text":"Good food, tons of vegan options and super budget-friendly. I recommend the Fusion Stir-Fried Noodles and Curried Pumpkin for anyone looking for vegan dinner options. The Traditional Potato & Veggie Samosas are also bomb."}
{"text":"After reading so many great reviews, I was anxious to try Samosa Hut so I went there for lunch today. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed.

I ordered the butter chicken with biryani rice and a mutton spring roll. For $1 more, I got a pop and a (lamb) samosa. With a 50 cents upcharge for the biryani rice, the total bill, with tax, came up to $11.01. Doesn't seem so cheap for lunch anymore.

The texture of the samosa was nice and crispy but the lamb flavour didn't really come through. The spring roll also had a nice crispy texture but I felt like there was more potato or similar filling than meat.

The butter chicken was the most disappointing. It was very sweet and the meat was dry, despite the sauce. The biryani rice had no flavour. Sadly, I've had better butter chicken from a frozen meal.

Unless I'm really missing something, I can't recommend Samosa Hut."}
{"text":"Omg yummy, I got two of each and they are all sooooooo good. The place is very clean. The prices are great."}
{"text":"This place does not have the authentic Indian style samosa's. Did not find any typical Indian style keema samosa's"}
{"text":"This place is amazing so many good different options
I would recommend the chai tea, roti, butter chicken samosa, and spinach samosa.
Great customer service"}
{"text":"Got super excited as soon as I walked in. Food looked fresh and the place was pretty busy. I literally wanted everything. I ended up going for rice and four veggies. I also grabbed two lamb samosas and three potato and spinach samosas. Everything was delicious and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We were looking for restaurants that offered meat samosas. Found this restaurant in the area and was quite clean. Ordered the beef and veggie samosas. They call the meat samosas the specialty ones and offer them 2 for a $1.89. They were small in size but filled with a good amount of meat. It wasn't your typical samosa that is usually made with 80% dough and 20% filling. They were a bit pricey considering they were small in size and the dough used was different compared to the normal samosa. I think these samosas would have been amazing if it had a different outer crisp cover. Would definitely like to try the other menu items."}
{"text":"The tandoori chicken and jerk tamrind chicken and Paratha Roti were stiff, tough and hard to chew, and probably equally as difficult to digest.

 When you tap your fork against the chicken, is it supposed to sound like someone knocking against the door? Check my video

To be honest I had a few bites of the food but mostly ended up throwing out a heavy plate of food. 

We also ordered the butter chicken and mutton Curry. The food was not very spicy but the positive thing is that it had lots of meat compared to Pakistani and Indian restaurants you will go to.

We ordered the mix n' match samosa, and I'm very annoyed with the fact that they limited to one order per person. If you want to order more, you better bring your family member with you and have them line up behind you. So stupid and pointless!

The Jerk Tamarind chicken, sweet eggplant and spinach samosa is for immature taste buds. Just has a lot of sugar added. 

Also the jerk samosa, curry samosa and chilli chicken samosa does not taste like the name. 

And they give the tiniest little container for Raita and then charge you $0.50 for an additional. Ridiculous! And the portion of biryani rice is smaller than other places and doesn't even really taste like briyani rice to be honest.

DO NOT buy your paratha here...

If I were to recommend anything, I would say the curries and sample the samosas.

Other than that, skip this place."}
{"text":"Some awesome food here! Great selection. Love what they do with the different varieties of kothu roti!"}
