{"text":"This is the place. If you like liver and onions, then you must try JB'S on Main. Yesterday I had a yearn for liver and onions and found very few restaurants that had it. JB'S  menu has a great value meal and we thought  to try it. I was pleasantly surprised. The liver was thinly sliced, done to a turn, the onions and bacon strips were the same. The potatoes and gravy, as well as the corn,were excellent. Food was hot, service was great. We were there about 2:30 PM, since we try to combine one meal for two, and it was very quiet. If you are a \"liver lover\", this is the place.          Howard N."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend wanted to try it out for the first time. Never never ever wanted to return. Turns out we were enjoying the buffet it was good though. So we go back to fill our plates again I come back only to see a big cockroach just chillin on my fork. I raised hell, and for my roachy meal for free."}
{"text":"We decided to try this...we were happy. Everything was clean but the bathrooms...I know, I hate that too. The food choices were good and the food tasty, not super awesome but good whole food. The service was superb and friendly. I liked it even though it was a small buffet it was worth the $7.99 price tag and I really liked the chorizo and eggs and the blueberry muffins."}
{"text":"Busy on Father's Day server was excellent, refills promptly along with food! Food was some of the best I have eaten in a while! Great place"}
{"text":"Pretty much what you would expect. Low prices, home style cooking, senior customer base. We've been in twice for breakfast. Average fare descent service. We'll go again and maybe try dinner next time."}
{"text":"Good American food, almost like Danny's but better, breakfast buffet I liked, friendly staff and good price, they been here for awhile and I am looking forward to come back again. Will recommend to friends an family."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service makes it 10x better! Loved the servers attitude, super friendly and knew everyone by name!"}
{"text":"The only thing preventing this place from getting 5 stars is the service. The waitresses there leave a lot to be desired. I was in there the other night and the place was virtually empty. However, the waitress seemed like she was in a rush and too busy to give proper service or attention. Shortly after sitting down after getting food from the salad bar we were presented with the check. Then she disappeared and didn't check back. I had to track her down to the front of the restaurant to put in a dessert order. It's a shame she was even given a tip by my date. I personally don't feel she earned it. On the lighter side, their food is always fabulous. The spaghetti is to die for."}
{"text":"This Is a decent location in Mesa, went here in September 2013 and March 2014 and both I had good services with. It is one of the cleanest I've seen and the buffet is really good, along with the Grilled Cheese and French fries, like the Northern Ave location, I get pudding and jello from the buffet. Good location."}
{"text":"I was curious about their breakfast buffet so decided to try it out.. The place looked clean, got my plate and headed to the buffet... What a disappointment, bacon well done enough to shatter..taste free biscuit and gravey..mushmouth hashbrowns..the cube potatoes had decent taste but cold. .limp French toast, passable scramble eggs..I was pretty peeved knowing I just blew  $8 on a crappy breakfast. Might try lunch or dinner sometime, but in no hurry to"}
{"text":"I just got into town, it's time for lunch and my friend suggests we go to JB's. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#2EgVWhCOv-7DeELNh0ZvWA     SERVICE: We walked in, are greeted with a smile and were seated quickly.  The servers are all very friendly and when I asked to get a small sample of one of the soups to taste it, they happily said \"of course!\"  FOOD: I look over the menu and everything looks really good, but I decided on the Cuban Melt.   It's roasted pulled pork, sliced ham, Swiss cheese, mustard and pickle chips on grilled marbled rye bread ($8.29). It comes with french fries and a dill pickle spear, but I opted for onion rings. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#t_Pp5iY7t8SiamWBuNvBEg A close up.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#x7NE7o3JicBDwCbVeb3o8Q  The roasted pork was tender and had a great flavor and everything else worked in unison to create delicious sandwich!  I opted for onion rings instead of fries.  They tasted pretty good but we're kinda greasy and when I bit into them the breading fell right off.  My friend had a bowl of clam chowder and said it was O-K. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#Ecs--5eNPD9QSXdLyo6Q4Q  One other note, while I didn't opt for the salad bar, I was impressed by the variety of items available!   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jbs-restaurant-phoenix?select=MTrO3mmvdXRGjMNW-zs7dA#0B-AG7KYniJehO-k0CdMcw  OVERALL: A really delicious lunch at a nice place with very friendly service."}
{"text":"Here's another great place for home-cooked meals.  They also have a really comprehensive buffet.  They have specials for the over 55 crowd, for breakfast and more.  On Wednesdays the place is hopping with retired folks playing pinochle and enjoying themselves.  This is one of the few places that I can get liver and onions as an entree so I go about once every two weeks. They also make wonderful sandwiches so don't hesitate to stop by if you're in the area.  The staff is quite good and the price is right."}
{"text":"Real good food and service. Lots of regulars."}
{"text":"I gave this two stars only because the food was good. I did kill a cockroach on my seat......that just grossed me out. I couldn't eat without searching around me for more roaches. I won't be going back....we are visiting here and plan to move to AZ soon but this will not be a place I will visit again. It is need of an updated look too.....very very out dated and blah. My son warned me...we should have listened to him. Sorry JB's you didn't make the cut."}
{"text":"Glad to have JB's in Sun City.  Food is the best of the moderately priced diner type restaurants.  Service is a little weak, but food and facilities are the best in the area (at their price point)."}
{"text":"If this review were just about the food during their breakfast buffet, this review would be an Eek! Me Thinks Not! The service was superb though. The drinks stayed full and the waitress was attentive and polite without lurking. I have ate at JB's in the past and enjoyed lunch and dinner meals so this review pertains to their breakfast buffet. First off, there bacon that tastes, looks and feels like bacon flavored cardboard. The eggs were really bad, perhaps the worst I have ever had. For the price tag of $10, there was no one there to make you an omelet and your selection was basically soggy french toast, pancakes (there was none available at the time), sausage (was okay), or the aforementioned bacon/paper. The gravy was the only thing that made the eggs palatable."}
{"text":"First trip to JB's was today for breakfast, I had the buffet.  The inside of the building looked aged and worn, but clean. Parking was easy, right off Power Rd or Main St, best to approach from the south or east.  The breakfast buffet was actually pretty darn good, and a great value for the price.  I'm not a huge fan of drip coffee since I have two espresso machines at home, but their coffee was also well above average.  The staff was a bit on the odd side but who am I to judge, but based on my experience I must say that I am sorry I didn't try this place earlier, I would highly recommend this restaurant over many of the others in the area for the breakfast buffet alone. I have not had lunch or dinner here yet but I will.  If I could suggest one thing for them would be to add lights over the chafing dishes on the buffet, and the handles of the big spoons sitting inside those things get very hot."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast here.    There were not very many people here, but it took a long time to get served.  Finally got some coffee and ordered.   I like the way biscuits and gravy is a side option.   But as I was waiting I noticed that there was a bunch of food under the booth across from me.   Eventually I got my food and was able to track down the occasional refill on the coffee.  Village in is right across the street and is cleaner and has better service."}
{"text":"This review will be focused on the cleanliness of this place and it's breakfast buffet offerings. This is the third time my husband and I have gone here for breakfast/lunch and I must say we've tried. You can only give a place so many chances before you just give up and stop going, this was that time for us.   The problems I have with breakfast buffet are twofold. It wasn't being maintained and it was running out of food faster than it could be replenished. Which when you think about it, that's not really fair to people coming in and paying for empty trays. Plus, tongs laying everywhere and food all over that's just not appetizing to look at.   Now, cleanliness was an issue at JB's my husband ordered a Dr.Pepper and he got the end of the bag because it was almost translucent and tasted terrible. I'm really surprised the waitress didn't notice that when it was being dispensed. She quickly replaced it once we pointed it out but then when she brought my husband a new glass-it had a big gross lipstick print on it! Unfortunately, my husband didn't notice until after he drank half of it and it really put him off his meal, he was ready to leave at that point. When we complained to the waitress she just said \"Oh, that's gross.\" No apology or anything she just agreed with us that it was gross and then never came back to our table.  Not even delicious bacon and cheap prices are enough to make us overlook clueless staff and drinks being served in dirty glasses. Sigh!"}
{"text":"This Is a place to be avoided. I ordered the all you can eat fish and shrimp. It took about 15 minutes to get my food. There was only 2 small fish filets and a handful of shrimp. The filets were over salted and the shrimp was tasteless. The menu stated bottomless fries but when I got my second plate of food no fries and the server actually argued that the fries are not unlimited. I had to bring it to the attention of the manager that the menu said BOTTOMLESS. The salad was brown. The server kept getting drink orders wrong. And at the end the pudding at the salad bar was spoiled. This is the first and last time I come here."}
{"text":"i love this place! great prices and awesome bbq burgers mmmmmm"}
{"text":"Homestyle meals.  More elderly and retired age customers than young families there which is exactly how we like it. No screaming, unruly children.  We'll return when we're back this way again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst!!!! Old building, old waitresses that are loud and gossipy. Came in to eat breakfast and all I heard out of this loud old waitress was her telling some elses issues instead of waiting on her tables. The manager walks around like hes doing something besides getting in the way. When we finally got our food I could of made it myself at home and it would have tasted better. So if you want to come to a over priced, incompetent, ancient place to get crappy food be my guest ."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant a couple of weeks ago for breakfast on a Monday and was impressed, not by the food (all breakfast buffets are basically the same) but by my waitress named Stephanie.  She was warm and friendly talking to people when she had time and just sharing warmth throughout all her tables.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good.  It's just that Stephanie made it outstanding. Today I brought my wife for the first time to this place for the first time.   I brought her because of my experience with Stephanie.  Our waitress was very polite and efficient.  We enjoyed our bkfst buffet very much. Upon leaving, we decided we'd go back......all because of the personality of one woman....Stephanie, whose name I just learned today. Recap:  Food good.  Ask for Stephanie's table it will kick your dining experience up a notch!"}
{"text":"The servers were so nice! A ton of seniors in the restaurant. The coffee was good. We did the weekend breakfast buffet. It was decent!"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter dinner. The food was ok. Definitely not as good as usual. They were slow so all the food just sat out. They finally brought out new food as we were getting ready to leave. Usually their salad bar is great and their soups are really good, especially the bell pepper and potato. Our waitress was phenomenal as always. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Small buffet, but everything was pretty good.  The service was excellent.  The best part of the breakfast buffet is the bacon.  You can have 20, 30, 40 pieces of bacon--as many bacons as you want.  A value!"}
{"text":"Staff are great and very friendly. Place is clean and food has always good. I have never had a issue there."}

{"text":"The services was excellent and the food buffet was really good I love there chicken soup I eat 7 bowls"}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious chicken fried steak. Excellent and courteous staff. I will be returning. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It wasn't terridble, but I'll never return.  The server was rude, the food was OK, but not good.  The good:  The onion rings and the place was fairly clean.  The bad: Server was rude and the steak sandwich was a lump of meat on a slice of bread cut in half... nothing else."}
{"text":"Not only bad food.  But bad service!!  Ask yourself, are u gonna spend $10.49 for a buffet for some cheap slop they whipped up for u with hardly ANY variety & NO DRINKS!!?  Manager was very rude, and said \"well that's how we do business \".  Smh. As me being in the restaurant business myself., that is NOT how u do business!!   Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else!!  Trust me. There are far better places than this place!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my family used to go to this restaurant all the time in Scottsdale. And we loved it! You get free meals on your birthday. I'm not sure if they still do that... Bur the food and service was always great!. I have not been to jb's since the one in Scottsdale closed. But the next time i am in Phoenix i will check out the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet was yummy for the kids. I ordered the ribeye and eggs. Steak was bettee than average for a breakfast type restaurant. Service was good and very friendly staff. Hot chocolate was delicious a d just what we needed after the rain coming down!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service but $2.69 for a regular cup of coffee!?! A bit much if you ask me.  I wasn't offered a refill either..."}
{"text":"We went there for the Sunday brunch. We got there at about 1230. And there was already no desserts available, that are supposed to come with the brunch. There were cold pancakes, cold eggs, and over cooked sausage. Our waitress checked on us one time. Worst brunch ever. I do not suggest going here"}
{"text":"We're hoping management will read this and take some action to implement a make over for this time warped atmosphere. We love the the service we get from Rosie and Danielle but the food has become so-so and the bathrooms are getting worse and worse! You have loyal employees who deserve a nicer working environment!! We're all about supporting local businesses but we have to draw the line on this one! Sorry!"}
{"text":"Steve, Noah and the rest of the team make this place quaint. Liver and onions was delicious. Nummers."}
{"text":"Best value Breakfast Buffet in Mesa. Military - Senior discount. Nothing fancy just well cooked  \"All you can eat\" breakfast  entries at a fair price and good service. This is our \"Go To\"  place when we have visitors. Main Street Antique Mall is 1/2 mile East. You will need to walk off your breakfast if you are like us.  :-)"}
{"text":"I had to go to another breakfast restaurant recently to realize how much I love JB's and the girls. First off, you get the exact breakfast you order: You want the bacon soft, it comes soft! You want the pancakes thin, they come thin.  But the best part is the service! Sallye, Cindy, Stephanie, and Danielle are like family. They have all been there for years. They know their regular customers names, and they also know what they usually order. They treat everyone as friends. They are very efficient, and act like they really enjoy being there with all of their buds. I live in Sun City, and there is a JB's there, but  I will go the extra 12 miles to see my waitress friends and eat at JB's on Northern! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Its a cool breakfast buffet joint, kinda like a Dennys. Seems to be a Mom n pop spot, a lot of old timers eat here. Food is ok, n service is fair! Im come here every so often if i wanna eat a buffet with all the bacon n eggs etc i want."}
{"text":"Came here for Father's day , they had a mini breakfast buffet which was awesome because we had hungry toddlers! Waitress was busy but was very attending ! Excellent food !  Cute little place :)"}
{"text":"When I want a breakfast buffet which has an extremely good variety of foods, a staff of individuals who are always kind, friendly, and helpful, and a laid back small town eatery atmosphere this is my go to place.  They treat everyone equally and respectfully. I will see a person come in who I recognize from panhandling, having a cup of coffee or a small meal and no one here looks down on them.  The individuals who frequent here are average everyday good people salt of the earth.  The food is homestyle and wholesome filling food and not fancy little plates of food. They tend to make their bacon on the buffet really crisp I prefer mine softer. Guess what, they are always kind enough to bring out a plate of the style I like at no charge, if I let them know that I like my bacon soft. That is awesome customer service people.  Communication is the key, because people aren't mind readers. If you treat people kindly and respectfully they will usually reciprocate in kind.   The atmosphere is that of little knick knacks my grandma would have spread about her little country house, countrybstyle decor. It brings back memories of good times from my childhood.  The breakfast buffet is a great price.  You will actually hear people having mealtime conversations, not just sitting on their phones oblivious to the world going on around them."}
{"text":"Better tasting than old town country buffet. Less choices. Great wait staff- very friendly.  Decided we will just take out at country boys ( big country breakfast)."}
{"text":"So I remember the old JB's on the corner at 19th and Bethany and out on 43rd and Indian School. The salad bar and weird brownish flecked plates were a big part of my childhood.   I hadn't been to JB's since those ones closed.   After a depressing experience at Ihop on 19th and Northern, we came to JB's to try and grab a plain meal. Nothing special.   Showed up at 8:30, about an hour and a half before they closed.   My girlfriend ordered cinnamon roll French toast, and I got a club sandwich.   Her food was real good, and she was happy. She's a pick egg eater, and was satisfied.   I'm a big club guy. I get a club wherever it is available. Their club was nothing special, and that's exactly what I was looking for. Just give me a club that's on plain toasted white bread with normal stuff. It was perfect.  Service was prompt and quick, and very nice. She brewed a new pot of decaf for me.   Place is plain. Doesn't look like its been updated since JB's switched from Maroon colors to Blue. (Remember that?)   It definitely feels like a greasy spoon in a small town. I like that.   While I am about 30 years younger than the main clientele, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was average and service was average. The place is definitely in need of a facelift. Don't waste your money on the salad bar."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but the breakfast buffet was horrible. Cold, dried out food. Could be a gold mine with the snowbirds if they put a little effort in the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Really good food, reasonable prices, great service, and extremely clean.  This adds up to a great experience.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Very dirty. Don't waste your time here. Go to Village Inn across the street. Cleaner and better food. And friendlier."}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet was delicious, well stocked, and had a great variety of choices.  I enjoyed the chorizo and eggs, and the biscuits and gravy.  It's a good buffet, for not a lot of money. I'll be back."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this restaurant is that the soup is super hot! I hate lukewarm soup. Plus they have three kinds to pick from. I usually eat alone ( poor me lol). So I normally bring a book or newspaper. No one bothers me but they do check on the table to see if I need anything. Everyone working there seems nice and I think they have a lot of regulars."}
{"text":"The food was surprising tasty!! The cook NAILED my eggs and I'm very picky with how my eggs are cooked. I request them \"medium, runny yolk with no runny whites.\" I am not a chef but I am able to cook my eggs just the way I request them, yet most cooks fail to get them right!! I typically don't eat them. Thanks Mr. Cook!!  The hash browns were unique! At first sight I was disappointed! They were not what I was expecting. Then I tasted them. YUM!! The ham slab was quality and large! The sourdough toast was THICK not the skinny typical toast that most restaurants serve! Everything was cooked PERFECTLY and it was hot and fresh!!  My company ate the SUPER BREAKFAST BUFFET!! I so would have eaten off the buffet, but it looked so good I was afraid I would eat too much!! They have a salad bar buffet for lunch. I am for sure going at lunch next time for the salad bar buffet!! Since Sizzler closed down, this is going to be a good replacement when I am in the area. The waitress told us that they offer three soups and they are all made fresh in house!   The service was friendly and perfect!!"}
{"text":"yummy breakfast! recently moved to the area, I love it! definitely a great yummy restaurant."}
{"text":"Only been to this place a few times but I'm very unimpressed. The food on both the salad bar and the breakfast bar looked less than appealing. Often had errors in both what was ordered and in service. I just refuse to go there again. Somehow I sense that this is a restaurant that's way past its life span. I'll also say that their menu is far from healthful. That is an indicator that they are out of touch with the real world. Perhaps they will be able to hang in there as long as the neighborhood elderly come. But those folks will undoubtedly take advantage of all the \"discounts\" that are offered. So,then the restaurant ends up with less profit and that eventually spells bad news for any business."}
{"text":"If you like cold food and very little variety for an absurd amount of money, then this is the place for you! Server doesn't check on you and has an attitude."}
{"text":"After being taken over by Angela Vasquez Cruz, the store located at 3567  west northern has fallen to waist. The lack of cleaning and maintenance to that location is appalling and down right dangerous!  Roach and rat infestations as well as broken down equipment and bad electrical issues.  As a former employee, I was disgusted by the lack of cleaning she expected. She wouldn't even allow for the dinning room floors to be mopped more than twice a week. Her indifference to the roach and rodent issues are disturbing considering that the customers are primarily seniors. I strongly feel she endangers her customers and employees with the lack of cleanlyness. After being made aware of the rat infestation in that location in November, she did nothing about it until  the end of May when the health department was called and discovered fecal matter from rats in food. Her store even made channel 5 dirty diners report. I left my job of almost four years do to the dirty, filthy conditions of the store and her discrimination against me personally. If I had been allowed to do more to cleaning it would have been done. But the sad trueth is that there is no logic or reasonable decisions being made when it comes to the running of that restaurant. She never once put the best interest of the store first. It was ran entirely based on her own personal agenda. I'm embarassed that I worked there, in the thirty years I've spent serving and working in the food industry, I have never worked with a manager as inept and completely incapable of doing her job. Between the filth and the other problems with her friends and family members all working there I have no doubt she will be the reason that store closes its doors. For the good employees there Like Salli and Stephany, who are both amazing servers, they are doomed to go down with the ship. Someone seriously needs to investigate her and the running of that store."}
