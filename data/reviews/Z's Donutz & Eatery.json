{"text":"This morning I stayed up to go for a morning drive at dawn. I found myself racing through the winding roads of the Cuyahoga Valley Reservation.  Eventually, after not eating breakfast, I was starving and jumped on Yelp for cheap nearby restaurants open at 8am. My search lead me to Z's.   The place looks like a quaint and inviting doughnut shop and inside has the feel of a nice basic cafe or deli. It almost Reminded me somewhat of a trucker stop, minus the tacky decorations and general griminess.  I bought a jelly-filled doughnut and a maple topped cinnamon bun. Both were fresh and delicious especially the thick maple covered dough of the cinnamon bun. The greatest part was that I was full and satisfied for under $3. There is a high likelyhood I will stop into Z's again on another morning cruise!"}
{"text":"As you drive by route 21 you could easily miss this little storefront lacking any real signage. Not many small independently owned Donut shops exist anymore due to the high amount of empty caloroies and carbs in a donut. For those few who still throw caution to the wind and ingest these little sugar balls regularly, this place should do. Coffee selection is either caffeine or no caffeine and donuts are not made on premise (but to be fair not many places make their own donuts) and selection is limited. The taste of the donuts is average at best.  Seating consist of a few simple small tables with lawnchair quality furnishings.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the people working there seem nice."}
{"text":"Well I've frequented this place a few times and everything has always been real good. But today I got their italian wedding soup, a cup is $3.50 reasonable, but only 2 meatballs in the soup. I like to have a hearty soup with many ingredients, not just broth. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great spot for a lunch or donut. Had chicken noodle Zoup, Italian sandwich and a Zaco.  All were very good. My son had the Zoup and said it was one of the best he had ever had. I had a very good Italian sandwich and tried the Zaco.  Also brought home a dozen donuts for the kids; although I ate two. Everything was fresh and delicious. The owners are good people too.  We will come back."}
{"text":"I have had two 35 seat dinners catered by Z's and a 106 plate wedding reception catered by Z's on New Years Eve. Good food and great owners Z and D! Also, get your morning coffee and donuts and then at lunch time good soup and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have never ordered something from this place that I didn't like. I do have my preferences- the beer cheese soup.  Probably my all time favorite soup ever. Very creamy. And the beer taste is not over powering.   The sandwiches are great as well. Keep in mind that the menu changes daily- so something you may not like may not be there that day.   Check their Facebook page around 9am. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure there will be something you like if what you originally wanted isn't there that day."}
{"text":"Weary from traveling, we stopped in to grab lunch. They were just about to close but took our order and allowed us to sit down and eat while they cleaned.  I got the chicken salad sandwich. It was so good and fresh. I planned on sharing a bite with my husband but I ended up eating it all and enjoying every bite. So good! He got the ham sandwich and was raving about it the whole time. She even gave him a free donut which made him happy. It's the sugar. He's a simple man. Clean facility, wonderful staff, and a general feel good atmosphere.   Will definitely be stopping back by on our way home."}
{"text":"Now with lunch sandwiches and what appears to be a new name: Z Donuts, I believe.  Lots of use (and overuse) of \"z\" themed foods:  Zoup.  Donutz.  You get the idea.  A little of that goze a LONG wayz.  Nice folkz, trying to establish zomething in Richfield other than noztalgia and abandoned trucking companeeze. A full display caze is also a good biziness plan."}
{"text":"I grab their fresh donuts for my office meetings at least twice a month.  the variety is awesome for a lil shop so my employees are happy.  I will sometimes grab lunch-love the pulled pork taco and the hot fresh tasty gumbo is my fave.  the staff is friendly and down home helpful.  great local place"}
{"text":"I have loved anything I have ever gotten here. My favorites are the pulled pork both in a sandwich and in a potato bowl. The soups are wonderful. It is family owned and operated with the knowing many people's names as regulars and welcoming them as they come in. I think you will like it, too!"}
{"text":"Big sammies and not too expensive either... And spick and FREAKEN span too!!"}
{"text":"Can't resist their chicken salad sandwich & their cake  donuts. I've tried a few other items on their menu and have yet to be disappointed.  The staff is always super nice as well."}
{"text":"I'm kind of a donut snob (yeah, I know, you're shocked) leaning towards Jack Frost, but I live MUCH closer to Z's so today thought I'd give it a go.   To say I was pleased and pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. Got a cinnamon roll (because I told the nice young lady, \"OK, it's my first visit here, what can't I miss?\" ) and a maple donut.  They were both as fresh and tasty as fresh and tasty get and pretty much killed my chances of eating one more carb for the rest of the day.   Good stuff, Z's, and I look forward to going back soon. Glad I finally found you."}
{"text":"The sausage gumbo is AMAZING. And the spicy Italian sausage is tasty! Will be visiting regularly from now on!!"}
{"text":"There were people in this place and they were in front of me with their 'me have it...me have it' selfish gimme gimme gimme attitudes barking out that they want this one and they want that one and they're all me me me gimme greedy sons of bitches. What's up with that?  When it was my turn I ordered donuts from this place and the kid put them in the box. My box. All you greedy bastards stop looking at my box and my donuts. They're all eyeing the donuts I got and mind-drooling on them and they're mine. They're mine. And your mind drool is spoiling everything. My donuts are my business.   I got glazed which were okay and I got lemon-filled which were awesome and I got custard-filled which is like whats left when the fatties get all the cream-filled. I got no cream-filled. I got chocolate and I got me one of those long donuts what isn't called a donut so you have to pay more and I got no coffee. Not any coffee. I also got a squirrelly glazed with a fancy name and I got me some of those cakey ones you need milk for.  Truckers in line behind me were mind-sexing my donuts which made me mad. Can't you wait and sex your own donuts? Really? This is food that I am going to eat here. For crying out loud, let a guy get him some donuts without needing to wash his food. Or his mind. Or his soul.  It was well-priced and the people who worked there were nice and the donuts were good and the whole thing was just fine. Except for the customers who were not like us yelpers with class and dignity."}
