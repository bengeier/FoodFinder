{"text":"This restaurant is five star plus!!! The bagels roll is superb!! You have to try it. Best sushi and dishes!! Don't waste your money on other places, go here!! You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great little place to order Thai food in the NHT/Irwin area. As a New York City transplant, I missed having Thai food as a staple in my take out repertoire.   I was so pleased when this placed opened and the food was good!  It definitely beats having to trek to Shadyside all the time.  Their Penang curry is very good. The Yellow curry is sweeter than others I've had but still pleasant with a nice pineapple flavor. Their basil chicken is definitely worth a try. Thai basil sauce is one of my favorites and this place does it right. Kudos!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last week and was not impressed. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great.  I had sweet and sour chicken, and won ton soup.  I really felt the flavor was bland.  Even the soup, something was missing. Maybe I'm just spoiled by another local establishment and how they season their food but like I said, I really was not impressed.   The employees are nice and the prices are good.   Maybe if my friends order from there again I'll give it another try and order something different."}
{"text":"Ok,  well I've pretty much eaten the Chinese /Japanese in the area.  The best is not that much better than the worst.  This place is better.  I didn't try the sushi yet.  But the Thai seafood and garlic broccoli shrimp and scallops were very above average.  Try this place.  The staff is very friendly. This place should be packed."}
{"text":"If you go here then you will become addicted.  Your money will be gone.  Your stomach happy.  I am so happy they do not have delivery or I would have a serious problem on my hands.    Their menu is extensive but nothing tastes premade.  The quality never changes.  We have yet to have anything poor here.  You can even order online, why can't more places do this?    The staff is quite friendly and will give your children chop stick lessons if they see them struggling.  A great place for families or for lunch.  But you've been warned about potential addictions."}
{"text":"My experience was poor, the miso soup was cold. The vegetable fried rice was very sticky and gross. But the workers were super nice! No wait though!"}
{"text":"This place has always been great but I haven't been here in a while and after eating here tonight I don't think I will be back again. The chicken I ordered was undercooked which I could've overlooked because I've never had an issue with their food but then there was a piece of metal in my box of fried rice. Very disappointed because I love this place. Maybe just a bad night. Pics posted!"}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi.  Took my son here today and we were searching for a non habachi place that did sushi as the prior are too damn expensive.  Well, we've found our new sushi place that won't break the bank when eating a la carte sushi.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm a martial artist (take and teach) and from that mainly over the years I've opened up alot more to exotic/Asian foods. I've tried out Yummy Palace a couple times now and I have to say I am quiet pleased with their food. I tried their shrimp with lobster sauce I think it was the first time. It was very good, bits of lobster with vegetables (greens, peas, and carrots noticeable in it) and rice. The second time I tried out their shrimp chow mein (my favorite Chinese dish). It was really good! Not the best I've had but different, they use cut up carrots in theirs and I don't think theirs has mushrooms (which I miss, I actually like mushrooms with Shrimp chow mein). On the plus side it came with Chinese noodles which other places don't always include.   Overall very good food and they got a regular customer out of me now. I reviewed this place because it sounds like a couple other people here aren't fans of Chinese to begin with. If you're not a fan of Chinese food you might want to pass because their dishes are pure, exotic Chinese food with many different ingredients to them. And if you go in not liking Chinese food you will probably have a biased opinion on them. But if you DO like Chinese food and/or you're looking for something different, I highly recommend it. I like Chinese because it's more on the healthy side than typical fast food/fried foods of today.   I got take out both times and they were very prompt. 15 minutes and the food was ready both times. Served in a nice container so no drips/spills. I've never ate inside but the employees are friendly and the inside is very nice and new inside. Nice, ambient lighting, quiet, and clean. It's not the best of the best Chinese food in the world (then again I haven't ate everything on their menu, I'm sure they have their specialty items that are their best  dish) but it's very good and a nice place to eat at if you live nearby or are visiting the Irwin area. And pricing is great, only around $10 bucks both times, enough to feed three people."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great price.  Try the Gregory roll..  You will love it..  Good for a quick lunch instead of fast food and even better for dinner.  Don't forget that it is BYOB."}
{"text":"These guys are good.   We come here often as we live in Irwin.  Tonight I had the Red Thai Shrimp which was very good.  My wife had her usual Moo Goo Gi Pan...in her words...excellent.... $1 up charge seems petty...Sushi is only fair...Jade Garden Murrysville is the place locally for Sushi....all in all it's a good place."}
{"text":"Great to find good Thai food and sushi in the same place! The drunken noodles were excellent and the sushi tasted very fresh! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I visited Yummy Palace for a weekend lunch.  The newly opened Yummy Palace is located in the Irwin Shopping Plaza, and offers Chinese, Japanese, and Thai food.  The inside of the restaurant was dimly lit, but appeared to be clean.   Out of the 25 or so tables, only  4 were taken (which is not out of the ordinary on an 80+ degree weekend in Pa).  I placed a take out order that included lunch special L22-sesame chicken, for $5.95, which came with an egg roll and rice (steamed, fried, or brown).  You can order soup (Egg Drop, Miso, Won Ton, or Hot & Sour), or a house salad, in place of an egg roll.  I also ordered the chicken teriyaki, which is not an option on the lunch menu, for $10.50.  The server informed me that my request for fried rice would be an additional $1.00.  The order was ready within the 15 minute wait time that I was quoted, and it stayed warm during the ride home. The lunch portions are prepared with the meat and the rice in the same plastic container.  The sesame chicken looked exactly as I expected... small chunks of  chicken, covered in dark sauce, and sprinkled with sesame seeds.  However, the taste could be compared to that of something you could order at a mall food court.  The egg roll was light and crispy...unfortunately, this was the best part of my meal. The chicken teriyaki was in a plastic container by itself, and the fried rice was in its own paper package.  The chicken was cut into perfect one inch strips resembling something that comes from a pre-cooked Tyson chicken meal.  It was coated in a light brown/orange sauce, and contained two pieces of broccoli.  The chicken was mushy, as if it were heated in a microwave.  It also lacked any flavor (no hint of ginger, soy, or salt), even though it was swimming in sauce.  The fried rice was acceptable, but was not worth $11.50 because it was the only part of the meal my boyfriend would eat.  Prior to trying this new restaurant, I searched for online feedback but only found two, one line reviews.  I am posting this review as a warning for those who are considering Yummy Palace since there are not many Chinese food options in the area.    I do not plan to return to Yummy Palace, and will drive the extra twenty minutes to go to China King in Greensburg."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a road trip back home and was very pleasantly surprised!  Huge selection of Chinese, Thai and Japanese dishes and everything we had was great!"}
{"text":"This food is amazing and fresh.  I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food, but I actually like everything I've tried here.  Prices are a little high for the dinners but you get a pretty large portion.  When I order chicken and then get an egg roll or crab Rangoon on the side it makes 2 large meals for me.  We usually get take-out from here and it is always ready quickly."}
{"text":"I have order sushi and Thai food here, both were excellent! I have never been disappointed by anything that I ordered here. I have also ordered online. They even went as far as to call me to double check on a sauce that I wanted on the side just to make sure I didn't want it on the food itself. They care about their customers and it shows. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner had spicy tuna roll it was pretty good. Wanted to try some tai food for the first time. It wasn't great pat tai chicken. I should of stuck with a Chinese dish. It seemed to be prepared ok just was't my thing. Will come back for the sushi for sure."}
{"text":"One of my favorite asian food places to eat! The staff is super friendly, the food is always delicious, and it is a wonderful atmosphere. I typically get the wonton woup and beef and broccoli and it's never been bad!"}
{"text":"Loved it, not real big on ordering takeout Chinese, but they offer all white meat and it was surprisingly really good:)"}
{"text":"The food at YP is above average and consistent and has a diverse menu, including Chinese, Thai, and sushi. The service is slow, no matter how busy they are. This time, the wait was nearly 30 minutes for 3 entrees. We had to remind the waitress, then the food came...but no plates. Then plates came...but no serving spoons. So, a good meal was lessened significantly by the service."}
{"text":"What a farce, said hey had delivery. Had to down load eat24 starving did that didn't work. Went on website said they delivered choose food called and guy said they don't deliver. You guys stink"}
{"text":"Very quaint restraint. Every time we come in, we're always greeted with smiles. After seating they quickly bring out hot towels and then take your order. Never had an issue with ordering. Food always came out as requested.   The food is great whether you're ordering sushi or an entree. I grew up on good fish and considering the location the fish used for the sushi is pretty good. Never had a bad piece.   Service is great. Everyone is pretty good at keeping up with drink refills or if you have other requests. Someone is always walking around especially when it's busy so it's not hard to catch them for a request.   I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Take out is super fast and staff is friendly. The food is great. Try the chicken teriyaki meal and the rock n roll sushi."}
{"text":"There food is not just great, but consistently great.  The workers are very nice and personable.  Definitely my \"go to\" place for Chinese in the Norwin area."}
{"text":"I will admit that when I first came here, I hated it. I got the chicken lo mein and thought it tasted like a barn smells. Not sure what was wrong or why it was tasting like that. I tasted my friend's general tso's with white meat and that was good, so thought it was just my dish, but still left disappointed.  Next time I came, I got sushi. MUCH better! It was actually one of the better places I've ever has sushi from. I got the shrimp tempura and it was delicious. I also got an eggroll which was cooked perfectly. Extremely crispy on the outside, which is exactly how I like them! My friend got the lunch special which was soup, salad, and two choices of rolls for $9.95, which wasn't a bad deal at all. I also love that they give you crispy Chinese noodles and sweet and sour sauce!  The service is always friendly and for the most part they are very attentive. I will definitely be back for sushi in the near future!"}
{"text":"Egg foo young overdone, chicken lomein has dark meat, was told it has white meat. Overall all 3 entrees we got were disappointing. Will not go back or recommend. ."}
{"text":"My chosen dish was not so yummy.  This was my second visit here, but I am not so sure there will be another.  If I were to base my rating on menu selections, atmosphere, and portion size, it would be 4 stars.  The two stars are due to the quality and taste of my particular order.  Personally, raw carrots and celery in an entree do not appeal to me when the other ingredients are cooked .  The brown sauce was loaded with sodium or MSG.  Couldn't wait to get rid of the side effects associated with a salty meal.  I noticed some other options on the menu that might have been more appealing and tasteful.    Might be worth another try, since it tends to be trial and error when one is not accustomed to a restaurant's preparation methods, and ingredients, for certain dishes."}
{"text":"Very good! Don't judge this place by its exterior... Good pan Asian cuisine.. We got sushi while my brother ordered Chinese... Service was very good"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place.  I always order their general Tso chicken white meat brown rice and it is perfect.   All of the sushi is really good ! Best place around !"}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi in the area. I had the salmon lover's and the spider roll.  Both were top notch!  Service was also prompt and friendly.  I haven't tried their thai or chinese dishes yet, but I look forward to it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian fusion restaurant in the Irwin area.  The wonton soup is my absolutely favorite - I *always* have someone bring me it when I'm hospitalized.  The other appetizers are really good, too - egg rolls, crab rangoon etc.  I've always been satisfied and enjoyed their sushi.  My favorite is the spicy crab meat roll.  For the Asian cuisine, I get the Szcheuan chicken and it's pretty good. My dad loves their spicy basil fried rice.  The service can be a little slow sometimes (understaffed during peak hours), but overall I really like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, beautiful decor. Food was amazing. Everything was so good!! My kids have the sweet and sour chicken with white rice, i had the walnut chicken and hubby had chicken teriyaki. Mine was very good as was hubbys. Thw crab ragoon was awesome! Spring rolls were good as well"}
{"text":"Never order Sashimi here... rip off!!! I got 2 orders for takeout and it was so small.  I'll never order Sashimi from here again.  The rest of the food was good though and the service has always been good when I ate at the restaurant"}
{"text":"Love Yummy Palace the food is fresh and delicious.  We love this restaurant more than PF Changs.  Staff is friendly and service is great.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I stopped here for takeout on the way home from work.  I got the Penang Curry tofu, and avocado rolls. Husband got kung pao chicken, egg roll and dumplings.       We were pleasantly surprised by the flavor of everything.  The restaurant was busy and the owner or manager apologized very much for the wait.        I didn't fully look over the takeout menu until getting home. The selection at this restaurant is incredible. They have all the favorites of Japanese, Chinese and Thai cuisine.         They have a huge selection of rolls. I noticed while paying that they also have bubble tea.        We will be returning and dining in.  For taste, flavor, variety , this place is great."}
{"text":"I have been to Yummy Palace half a dozen times since I first discovered it. We always have a good experience. However, yesterday was probably the best. My brother and his family had never been there so they wanted to finally try it. My dad had been there once, but couldn't remember what he ordered or how it tasted it.   My brother doesn't normally eat asian cuisine and my dad is very picky about meat. Everyone had an excellent lunch including my 7 year old nephew who is as picky about food as his father. Not only did we all enjoy our meals, but we all seemed to be talking about how good everything was. Husband and I ordered a Crazy House Roll, and even though it came out last (normally the sushi is first,) it was delicious and the perfect way to end lunch. It was spicy and crunchy, but didn't taste fried or heavy. Definitely recommend it.   Remember to order all white meat chicken. It's definitely worth the extra buck!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants! Been going here since they opened used to go at least once or twice a week when I lived close. Sushi is amazing and made on the spot. Best crabmeat Rangoon's I've ever had. Egg rolls are always amazing and I have never been disappointed with my food choice!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food, great service, and affordable. What more could you ask for?  The Thai curry dishes and hot soups are my favorite. A gem I did not expect in Irwin, PA"}
{"text":"Yummy Palace has delicious food! They always have fresh tasting food and fast service, my favorite part are the hot towels they bring to the table to clean your hands with before you eat, this is especially nice in the winter."}
{"text":"I've only ever had sushi here, and it's always been good! Their lunch sushi special is a very good deal! The staff is very pleasant there."}
{"text":"First time here in 4+ years and the food hasn't lost a single bit in quality,  freshness or flavor!  Wife had Mongolian beef with hot and sour soup and she thinks the hot and sour soup is the best of all the local places we frequent.   I had moo shu pork and unagi and tako sushi. The moo shu was great and the sushi was fresh, prepared well and excellent in flavor  Service was just right even though the restaurant was almost completely full.   All in all, really nice place to get great Chinese food and service to match."}
{"text":"I love the Yummy Palace!!  It is the best sushi in the area!!  Their oshinko roll and avocado peanut rolls are to die for!  I have been there about 6 times now to date, and the sushi is so amazing that I have never tried anything else!  You can even order online for dine in and pick up."}
{"text":"We first enjoyed both service and food at this restaurant. But the last two times we ordered food we could not eat it. We ended up either feeding it to the dog or pitching it. It's sad because there are very few good oriental in the area."}
{"text":"None of my family like their meal. I heard great things about Yummy Palace, and wanted to like if, but it was just bad."}
{"text":"Best place ever. I've been so many other places trying to find Wonton soup as good as theirs, and it can't be done. Lol. I moved away from Irwin, but still go back just to eat there. Please don't ever close down. I love the food and the service is fantastic. Mmm"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch. Excellent General Tso's .  Everyone enjoyed.  My son said the lomein is #awesome"}
