{"text":"Pretty good food. Prices are a little high. Poor customer service. Really weird hours. I could skip it but it's the best white pizza I've found in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I can't speak on the food because I've called 3 times to place a carry out order on 3 separate occasions and I'm yet to actually talk to someone. If they can't answer their phone then I can't try the food."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the pizza and it was overpriced. 2 slices was $9. Pizza was dry as a hot day in Arizona"}
{"text":"The pizza is off the hook. It's a real live New York attitude and my family lived it. John and Bob are great! They always give us extra stuff and we are never sorry we go. The billis half of what it cost for me and my family of six to eat out.

{"text":"One word ... Wow ... I had the pleasure of trying Junior's for the 1st time while @ work this week. The pepperoni pie made my top 3 in Charlotte. If you like thin crust and are not afraid of a little grease you will LOVE this. Even the crust is great. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good!  We usually go to Luigi's, but this place just opened up, and it's just as good and it saves about a 10 minute car ride at lunch.

It can get a little busy at lunch but you have your food within 5-10 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! Had a Chicken Parm sandwich with fries, no drink = $14.50. The sandwich was tough with not enough sauce and very little cheese and the fries tasted like they were fried in 2 week old oil. The only thing that keeps this place open is the lack of restaurants in the area. Do yourself a favor and pass on this place."}
{"text":"The worst slice of pizza I ever had from any restaurant. I had the barbecue chicken I think it sat there for hours it was dry and the smallest piece I have ever paid $4  for. The restroom was locked and I had to get a key from the front like I was in some cheap gas station.

I do not recommend this place and this is a far cry from Tony's pizza which I think is one of the best in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Closed on a Saturday at 6:13 pm when the sign clearly reads open till 8 pm on Saturday. Not even a note on the door to say \"Sorry we suck today\"."}
{"text":"Best chicken parm sandwich since moving from New Jersey. Great food and service. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza.. Great appetizers.. Chicken Parm pizza is the best.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I travel to NC for work weekly and my hotel is close to Junior's.  I'm so glad I found this little gem.  It's become a dinner staple for me. The pizza is fantastic, but so is everything else I've tried on the menu.  From the baked Ziti to the connoli, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"A group of us stopped in for lunch while we were visiting Charlotte.  Not only was the pizza cheap, it's some of the best I've had for the price.  Service was also nice and fast.  The atmosphere was great, what with several TVs hung around.  All in all, it's the perfect setup for a nice, quick lunch."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good prices and quick service.

I love that you can get a variety of pizza flavors by the slice.  We love the Lasanga pizza.  

Although I'm sure they don't make them on site, we love the Black and White cookie they sell. It's my fav I've found in Charlotte."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Their chicken parm with alfredo sauce is the best.  Pizza tastes just like what I had growing up in New York.  Authentic sauce, good prices.  Only suggestion is allow customers to buy a side of alfredo to dip our crust in!!

Will be back."}
{"text":"Grandmas slice at Juniors is the best slice I've had in years- & I'm a NYer. Excellent crispy crust- fantastic sauce & cheese."}
{"text":"I've been in lots of so call pizzeria but this one is my favorite. The dough is do crunchie and very good."}
{"text":"Still in search for an amazing pizza place!

The pizza was good!  A tad bit saucy for my taste though.

I had two left over slices. The guy gave me a paper bag. I thought that was interesting, but thought it must have some quality or strength to use it to bring it home. 

As my friend is driving, I'm holding this bag with two pieces of pizza in it. The oils are spreading all over the bag and I started to wonder about all of the oily pizza I just consumed. My hands are so oily, that we had to stop to toss it in the trash before we got home. 

I recommend Skipping the pasta all together! I ordered the Penne ala vodka. I took one bite and yuck! The sauce is not very good, and the pasta was hard. They also plopped three little rolls on top of it."}
{"text":"I came here often when I worked across the street. The pizza is great and tasty. The prices are great (they do discounts off the original price all the time I think) and have great lunch specials. Definitely worth going to one day."}
{"text":"Now this...is really good pizza!

I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to stop by!

Right away, I was pleased to see that my \"pizza by the slice\" options were not just limited to cheese and pepperoni. They have an amazing variety here everything from veggie, chicken parmesan and white pizza to a meat lovers, Sicilian and even a lasagna just to name a few.

I went with a slice of the white pizza and my friend went with the lasagna...pretty much the white pizza but topped with meatballs. Can you say Yum?!

Both were very, very good. No, really they were VERY good! 

Here's the rundown: the slices are large and very filling...one slice can definitely fill you up! They are not overly greasy and the crust is winning...seriously... It's Perfect! 

This place is definitely a gem in the area! I'm sure to be a regular!"}
{"text":"I love finding NY pizzerias like Junior's around Charlotte. I've always been a fan of Libretto's and Junior's just may now be right up there with the best of them! Although I have not tried their pizza slices (I definitely will be returning to do just that soon, though), I did order a pepperoni calzone that was made to order. I anxiously waited about 15 minutes for my calzone and was amazed at how big it was (that's what she said) when it was dropped off to my table! I could only eat half of the calzone there at the restaurant and saved the rest for a snack later at home. My boyfriend also had the stromboli which was just as yummy. Seriously, the mozzarella and ricotta were in abundance, which makes me just want to die of foodie happiness. The dough was crispy, yet chewy. This was MY kind of calzone.

The service was fast and friendly and the pricing seemed average (about $25 for a stromboli, calzone and 2 soft drinks). I am plotting my next trip to Junior's just so I can try some of their more creative pizza slice options... Chicken Parm Pizza anyone?"}
{"text":"The pizza was not bad, and the mozzarella sticks were decent. I need to try it fredher I guess. I ordered to go and it took me a few minutes to get into it. I love the prices and I'll be back to give them a more fair shot at impressing me."}
{"text":"Possibly the best pizza I have ever eaten! Great flavor and just the right amount of sauce and cheese. We had a large order delivered for a volunteer event and the guy arrived early, he was very nice and helpful in getting everything set up, and the pizza was still fresh and hot! Their salad was very fresh and the Italian dressing was yummy too! We were all very impressed! I wish this pizza place were closer to my house so we could order from here more often!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch date with my hubby. We ended up each getting 2 slices (that were very large) We wanted to try as many slices as we could. Shameful... I know... but we also got garlic knots. 
Slice 1- Hawaiian  the slices were all extra large, this one was perfect. It was my number #1, my favorite for sure. 
Slice 2- White slice, also pretty good. It was my runner up though. There was nothing overly exciting about it but it was a true solid slice. 
Knots- coming from NY I haven't really found a good knot yet. These tasted good but I'm still missing the light fluffy  knot. All the knots I have tried are dense and greasy. All though they are good, they are not what I am looking for. The side sauce was too tart for my taste but that's just my personal preference. 

The restaurant was cute, a regular pizza joint. I enjoyed all the NY sports on the walls... it feels like home. The staff was super nice and friendly. I can't wait to go back and try more. Solid pizza here folks."}
{"text":"Pizza is mediocre at best. No flavor. Not to mention the older guy who took my order was rude & felt the need to tell me (of all the other customers before me that ordered water) that they were going to start charging .25 cents for water cups because \"too many people are ordering water\". He also was digging in his eye with his protective gloves on & proceeding to carry out food. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I like the pizza at this place. It's one of the few places that have BBQ Chicken slices and they're good. They don't have it normally in the afternoon after 4pm but I went there today for lunch and it was there so I had to indulge."}
{"text":"We were on our way back to pa. Stayed at the renaissance suites. They had awesome pizza very good experience had to write a review. Thanks!"}
{"text":"As a person that lived in Brooklyn for way to long, the one thing I always long for  is anything even near as good as Vesuvio's in Bay Ridge.  Well, while Juniors is FANTASTIC, it still falls short (it must be the water)...but I spend a lot of time in Charlotte and I find myself ordering from Juniors a lot...just an FYI, they close at 8pm   If you like true NYC style pizza, this is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I'd love to write a review.  However junior decided to close early and not serve a hungry customer at the door.  It was like the commercial for the bank when they stop him then close the doors for the day.  Rude is what that is!"}
{"text":"The garlic knots were very enjoyable and a good value as well, taking price, quantity and quality into account.

I also ordered a cheese Calzone that was sufficiently packed with mozzarella and ricotta in the perfect ratio.  The crust however wasn't quite worthy of a pizza classification and it ended up diminishing the fine flavor and quality of the filling.  The calzone was also slightly pricey considering its size.

Junior's Sicilian pizza deserves a commendation.  Good Sicilian pizza is a difficult task but Junior's mastered the undertaking notably.  The crust was neither too yeasty tasting nor was it textured like focaccia.  Their Sicilian is a true standout with a nice blend or sauce and cheese.  My only suggestion is to add a bit more of the latter.  The layer a cheese was a bit thin.

Also on our order was the Meat Lover's pizza.  I am sorry to report that it fell short of expectations, especially considering the $24.00 price tag.  There was a time when Toppers had a better Meat Lovers pizza but those days are gone due to cost cutbacks as a result of the economy.

Junior's Pizzeria certainly has items worth returning for but there are a few to stay away from.  I would give it 3.5 stars if Yelp permitted."}
{"text":"Juniors keeps on impressing me! My company orders from here frequently and the bbq chicken pie is top notch but today I realized they had a gluten free option. I think this is a great way to compete with other pizza spots like fuel, pizza peel and mellow. 

Their GF pie is great, one of the best I've had and can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"For a place that has pizza cooked and ready to reheat they are pretty good. 
Brooklyn fold-n-eat style crust was good. 
They use good ingredients so it tasted good. 
Over all they were good and I will return if I return to the area...and want pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza not as good as Luigis. Very pricey. Almost 3 bucks for a plain cheese slice."}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte and I finally got to see what all f the hype was about. One of my coworkers raged about the \"grandmother\" pizza so I had to try it. And trust me, I was NOT disappointed one bit. The crust is thick but not overwhelming - has a nice crunch to it. Although it was busy, the service was quick and the staff really makes it a family atmosphere! I excited to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Junior's your pizza is awesome.  So why no more than 3 stars?  Well because you charge $25 for a two topping pizza.  I don't need to get raped with marinara sauce. Seriously this place is pretty good, but just ridiculousy overpriced.  Pizza in NYC is about $8 cheaper.  What gives?"}
{"text":"We're staying at the Hyatt before catching an early morning flight and after reading some area reviews, decided to try Juniors for dinner. 

I'm glad we did! We didn't have pizza, so I can't comment, but we ordered take-out and we're super happy to discover it's really good! After living in Charleston for 15 years, it reminded us of the local Connecticut red-sauce restaurant we desperately miss. (We tried to convince the Staten Island owner to make us happy and move to our way but no luck. Other reviews noted high prices but we ordered the dinner specials - chicken parm/ziti and spaghetti/garlic knots for $8.95 each and the portions were huge. Can't beat that. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side. The food is good, but just a little too far of a drive for me. If I'm in the area I would definitely stop by for a slice. When the pizza is good one doesn't mind spending a little extra for it. Big NY style slices is always a plus."}
{"text":"So I've lived near Lorenzo's Pizzeria for a few years but have never tried it.  They just opened a new place at Tyvola and Yorkmont and it's called Junior's Pizzeria.  There is no other pizza place near here, and definitely no NY Style pizza place too close to here.  A few coworkers tried the pizza a couple of weeks ago and they loved it.  Today, we got a couple of large pizzas (18\" each) and they were tasty.  It's 100x better than Luigi's (if I was from NYC I would insert a cliched \"hands down\" here).  Why is it better?  There are several reasons.  First, the crust is a little thicker (although not as thick as Libretto's).  Second, they use a lot more cheese, which probably explains some of their higher prices.  Finally, their ingredients are fresher.  Their mushrooms are the fresh kind and not the slimy canned ones.

It's about $18 for a large one topping pizza cut into 8 big slices, but it's almost worth it.  The menu is a little scaled down from Lorenzo's as all of the places here really only cater to lunch customers.  I'm glad that Junior's opened near the office and will be returning there for slices on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Good New York style slices. Great for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"I have had Junior's Pizza a number of times and just would like to say they are Great, they have so many options of pizza that it might take you a minute to decide. The staff is always helpful and courteous, something that is missing in a lot of businesses these days. The lunch time rush can be pretty hectic with so many large companies in walking distance to Junior's. I will be back and with bells on, I am only giving them a 4 Stars because they close \"Too Darn Early\" especially on a Friday night. My wife was throwing a Bachelorette party for a very close friend this past weekend and she asked about Junior's and I said it was excellent. To her dismay they closed at 8 pm, I understand that they are located in a business park area but there are around 6 hotels within 1.5 miles so you think they would stay open a little later, at least 9:30.

P.S. I will be checking in here in about another hour or so for lunch, see you there if you like good pizza...."}
{"text":"Came in at 2:30 today. Ordered 3 personal pizzas and garlic knots, 3 sodas. Our total was 49.46...no big deal. Part of the order comes to the table and 3 individual slices not heated and one was a random slice no one ordered. We corrected the guy and said hey this was supposed to be a personal and he shrugged and said oh man can you just eat this? I walked up to the counter to ask to please make us what was ordered and the owner came out and barked at me and the counter guy tried to go back and fourth telling me he didn't mess up. I said fix it and let's just call it even...2 dollar difference and it was their mistake. The owner told me I could get the f out of his restuatant and not eat here. Instead of being appalled and just leaving and getting a refund, the difference was paid and we will just enjoy our pizza. Really dissatisfied with the awful customer service...besides that, pizza is good."}
{"text":"Crust is thinner in the middle, so toppings tend to slide off. But that's not so much an indictment of the crust as it is reflection of the copious volume of toppings. Sliced sausage is a plus. I make my reviews almost solely on the basis of taste, but the service when I picked up was fast and personable."}
{"text":"Staff is EXTREMELY Polite, Friendly and plenty Helpful!  This is NOT a place where you have a waiter... You Order at the Counter and they bring your Food to your Table, yet the Delivery of your food is Much more than you would expect in a place like this!!!  If I were basing my review on Service or Politeness they would get FIVE Yelp stars, or SIX! !! !!!  Easily!

The Best Compliment I can give them is that I noticed employees from three of the four Restaurants (they were wearing Uniforms) in the Complex (it is only Restaurants and a convenience store in the complex) were eating here!!!  It was about 2:00 so the other places did not have customers and they want to eat here!!!  One of the neighboring Restaurants had at least two of their employees eating here!

Now the tough part the Food was prepared I believe as well as it can be, they seem to have an Excellence Mentality about Service, Cleanliness and Preparation!  I appreciate that!!!

Pizza : : 

Crust had decent flavor, was Better than Al's Pizza, still seemed a little overworked, not to say it was chewy, that part was fine...

Sauce had an ok flavor, on the bland side, just slightly better

Cheese was NOT a Blend!  Yay!!!  If this was a blend, they did it well!  Still only gets 2 1/2 yelp stars because it lacked the flavor I LOVE in a plain Cheese Pizza!  Maybe a little Too Greasy...

Wish They Had Sandwiches, even though I'm not going back they could put their \"Jersey\" Neighbor Out!!!  Maybe they will anyway because their Pizza is Way Better than \"his\" sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to get pizza! We accidentally showed up at closing time. The staff didn't tell us, which was nice. We ordered a whole pizza, spaghetti dinner, and garlic knots. Service was extremely fast and polite. 

The best thing about the whole experience was my daughter ordered the spaghetti without meat sauce, I asked for some butter, the employee said we do not have butter. So I said ok. About five minutes later the employee came back with a cup of melted butter from the restaurant next-door. I was totally shocked, what a great thing that employee did for my daughter!!

Also I will warn you with the garlic knots, I loved them! My wife doesn't like a lot of garlic and they do come with a boatload of garlic! So prepare yourself. 

I highly recommend this place, the only reason why I did not give it five stars was the cost of the pizza. It seem expensive. $20-$25 for a pizza pie.  However we are not from Charlotte, so I'm sure if that's normal pricing around here for pizza."}
{"text":"Just moved to the charlotte area last night and after a long day of unpacking I was very tired and decided to order some pizza. I called Junior's and asked if they delivered (I was so tired i didn't feel like leaving my apartment). I got the feeling they don't usually deliver but the guy who answered agreed to drop it off for me. 

About 10-15 minutes late this guy shows up with the pizza and it turns out he was the owner! Really great guy. He even called about an hour later to see if I had enjoyed the pizza!!

Besides the great service the pizza was top notch. I will be a customer for life."}
{"text":"Off the hook. I am from Brooklyn and thought I was back home. They have the Brooklyn accents too. I felt like I was watching mob wives. Awesome!!! Finally a pizzeria that doesn't serve  anything else but. I go here like 3 times a week and I special order my whole pie when I bring friends. The pizza is crispy but not  thin like cardboard. It's worth every penny. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Stepping into Junior's was like stepping into a warm New York City pizzeria. And it practically is - the owner, John, is a bona fide New Yorker who is so kind and does not mess around when it comes to high-quality, authentically NY Italian food. My dad and I had never been before and came by before heading to CLT airport. We struck up a conversation with John, and it felt like we were in a friendly neighborhood pizzeria. I had the chicken parmesan slice and it was extraordinary. Perfect crust consistency and a just-right ratio of sauce to cheese to bread. The chicken fettuccini alfredo was also delicious, and a big serving for the price! But the absolute must-have is Grandma's pie. We got a taste after John told us it was their signature dish. If you've ever eaten authentic New York food, taking a bite of Grandma's pie will probably bring back a flood of memories. Highly recommend the whole experience!"}
{"text":"Really dirty and mediocre food.  These guys need to go back up north and learn the trade.  Nothing to offer and crabby attitudes as well
Very sketchy people"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite lunch spot for lots of people at my office.  I personally think it's the best pizza in Charlotte!  I would seriously drive across town to get pizza from here.  Also the meatball sub is amazing and the pasta dishes are really great too.  You really can't go wrong with Junior's.  They sell pizza by the slice as well as whole pies.  They have good lunch specials the include pasta dish, bread, and a beverage.  Service is always nice and fast."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!!! In a strip of restaurant rip offs, they have great food@ a REASONABLE price(for our biz park area anyway). I wouldn't order a sub here, just get slices. The ingredients are worth the money-in my opinion. Def my #1 choice of the options we have over there."}
{"text":"It's good, little pricey, and you also get a little of the New England charm...(I.e. Not the real southern hospitality kindness... ) but hey it's  a pizza place where you watch sports..."}
{"text":"As I was raised on New York pizza, I am a confirmed pizza snob and proud of it.  I have been to Junior's several times and never ordered pizza.  Well, my mistake!  This pizza is as close to what I grew up eating as anything I've had since I migrated below the Mason-Dixon line!  

The crust is thin and crisp, the toppings numerous and delish.  I had a slice of cheese and one of chicken parm.  The cheese was nice and gooey and there was just the right of olive oil floating on top. The portions were extremely generous.

The service was friendly and pretty fast considering that the place was packed.  

I am converted!  I will definitely return for another slice!"}
{"text":"So many flavors and choices, you can't help but fall in love with Junior's Pizzeria.... It is almost mandatory to get right off the plane and head over there. Try the lasagna pizza or the chicken scarpariello pasta (no idea how to say it but it is sooo good!). Other pizzas that you will love are: Chicken Parm, Hawaiian, Margherita, BBQ Chicken, White Pie (mozz ricotta garlic)."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick slice to go today. New Yorkers know what I'm talking about. This process shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. Hit the window/counter... order... and you're gone. 
I'm glad juniors obliged me. A Bustling lunch crowd didn't stop my two hot, NY style slices from being served up quickly. 
Reminiscent of my childhood, all that was missing was the 25 cent fruit punch. 
 The pizza is good, and this place holds its own when it comes to claiming NY style. Will need to try something other than plain slice one day"}
{"text":"If you don't know NY style pizza, then you won't know there's a real difference from what you're currently eating from your favorite place! Junior's is the real deal, pies done right, and in a true NY fashion! We stumbled across this place after getting off a flight in Charlotte. We made a point to give them a try after seeing they had true White Pies! Although this occasion we didn't try one, instead we went with a Sicilian and a Pepperoni. You've never had a real Sicilian until you've had someone from NY that knows what they're doing make you one! Junior's knows! Thick, chewy, and yet light all at the same time! Their sauce is phenomenal, as well as the quality of the pepperoni on their pies! After also enjoying a very good Caesar salad, I just realized that anything here was going to be spot on. After talking to the guys a bit while we were there, we found that indeed they are from NY! Do yourself a favor and stop going to your local Italian spot, and take advantage of this real gem right near the airport! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I hate giving one star reviews but the service is really bad. Owners are rude and terrible at servicing the customer. They are also very cheap and condescending. The pizza is pretty good. Better than I expected for pizza outside of New York but just so depressingly bad."}
{"text":"Very good service, and good atmosphere,  but the stromboli roll that I had was awful.  The roll was listed as ham, pepperoni, and  salami with select toppings and mozzarella. These ingredients are wrapped in pizza dough and baked.  It sounded so good!  Unfortunately the meat tasted a bit spoiled and the dough was soaked with oil and water on the bottom, which made it extremely soggy.    I opened the roll to check out the ingredients.   Non of the meat looked right to me. If there was ham and pepperoni in it, I would not know.   I  could not tell the difference between the meats.  I really should have stuck with the pizza.  I will try this place again only because the pizzas on display looked delicious.  Who knows.   Maybe I just ordered the wrong dish."}
{"text":"Junior's provides a great NY style slice of pizza, best I've had outside of Jersey or NYC. The owner and staff are friendly and make sure you've had a great experience. Service has always been prompt and the place is always clean.

For great pizza or sandwich this is my go to spot for lunch and I can't more highly recommend them."}
{"text":"Too much food!  

I had the pasta bowl special with garlic knots and a drink. 

Pasta seemed a little over done (I prefer al dente)
Sauce was good.  Could have used more peppers. 

Overall a good value; just only ate about 1/3 of the food."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening. Had to settle for a stromboli because they had nothing else.  It was over cooked and dry.  As for pricing way over priced when compared to Tony's Pizza.."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza i have had since moving from NJ. Penne with alfredo sauce is amazing. I wish i would've found this place 3 yrs ago. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I must have hit the evening crowd. 17 Aug. 15. Oh no I didn't, there was no one in the store. I waited 35min. for a pizza, or shoe, I don't know which."}
{"text":"Stopped in for 2 slices of pepperoni and a fountain drink for lunch. Pizza is really good. It's over $9 for what my lunch which seems a little high but it is tasty."}
{"text":"Seriously good New York style pizza! Thin, crisp but chewy crust, great variety of ready made pizza-by-the-slice at lunchtime...something to suit any mood. Good thing I'm only visiting town or I'd spend way too much time here."}
{"text":"I love that we finally have a NY-style pizza joint right near my office. I went in and the place was slammed - always a good sign! I was a bit shocked to see that a chicken parm sub was over $10 not including tax. That to me is a bit too high for a pizza place. I asked how long a to-go sub would take and they responded 15 minutes ...so I went with a slice. Since I refuse to pay over $3 for a slice of pizza my options were limited to just cheese. I get it, they use a lot of cheese and perhaps that's why the costs are high but I also like sauce on my pizza and that was lacking. I will say it was tasty but it wasn't anything fabulous for the high prices. Would I prefer Juniors over Dominoes or that god-awful Papa Johns? Absolutely. 

Perhaps this place could benefit from a lunch special or slice of the day. I would honestly rather drive a little farther and head to Hawthornes and pay $6 for a slice, side salad, and a soda."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte on a business trip and stayed at the Hyatt place which is located across the street from this awesome pizza place!
I read some of the reviews and decided to try it... So glad I did! The veggie pizza I ordered was excellent, very well made, crust was thin and crunchy just I how like it and all the ingredients fresh and well portioned. I would totally go back if I lived in Charlotte but I'm from San Diego lol. Job well done guys! CHEERS."}
{"text":"Great NY Style Pizza!  This Queens native makes it #1 in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  An entire pizza is 18\".  We didn't realize that when we ordered...lol.  Staff was friendly.  I will definitely eat here again when traveling back through the area."}
{"text":"Visited Junior's Pizzeria last night for the first time and was SO impressed! My fiancé is Italian, so we're always looking for delicious Italian restaurants and/or pizzerias in the charlotte area and this one is MY FAVORITE! He order a Sicilian pepperoni pizza and I got their chicken parmigiana dinner special (with 3 garlic knots- SCORE!). And quite honestly- it knocked my socks off. I'm eating the leftovers as I type this and it's JUST AS GOOD the second day! On our way out the owner (who was working the register, mind you) stopped us to make sure we enjoyed our dinner and had a wonderful conversation!! In summary, great food, great people, great place!"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, I love the spaghetti and meatballs with garlic knots.  The prices can be a bit steep but the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Being a life long Charlottean, I'm sure I don't know much about \"real\" NY style pizza and my wife is happy to confirm this fact, along with the complaint often voiced by transplants from parts North that there is no good pizza in Charlotte. We have tried them all and Luigi's and Luisa's Brick oven were about the best. Working on a strong pizza craving we stopped into Junior's Pizzeria the other day for a slice. Let me say that the first slice was so good we ordered another and considered a whole pie but decided to pass...for now. I had pepperoni and Sausage and my wife had just Pepperoni, they were both stellar in all aspects of the pizza maker's art. The crust is thin and flavorful, a combination that is surprisingly hard to come by. The cheese was perfect and plentiful, toppings obviously high-quality. I loved that it came to the table piping hot, in fact too hot to eat and the crust was so crisp. The familiar orange grease dripped onto the plate and we were in heaven. Once i get my fill of pizza I will branch out and try some of the other offerings and I'll be sure to Yelp about it. The smell alone when you walk in will transport you to your favorite Italian restaurant or maybe your Grandmother's kitchen. The decor is the standard NY sports stuff and the service is mostly Self-service, but you won't keep coming back again and again for the service, it will be the craving for Junior's pizza."}
{"text":"Place is going down hill fast. Slow service sometimes, food is pretty good if u can put up with the bull.  Bathrooms need newdoor knobs.   

Try salsaritas next door or the sub shop.  Good fresh food!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. Crispy crust and good cheese. I've had a calzone here too (or was it a Stromboli?) and it was huge and tasty. Recommend it if you're in the area and craving a decent slice. A little over priced in my opinion but I guess that's part of the trade off for being the only New York style pizza spot in the immediate area."}
{"text":"I placed a large order last night for delivery to Renaissance Suites Hotel. 10 pizzas and 100 wings were excellent, on time, and service was outstanding. Thanks for the great food and prompt service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch during my break.  Lasagna, 3 garlic knots and a drink for less than 10 bucks. The hearing time took ages but it was worth the wait. Huge piece, fluffy, not doughy, garlic knots and enough extra sauce to satisfy anyone. Bummed that it took so long but I'd do it again. Mid level food quality for a place like this but we'll made and relatively clean place. Bathrooms were either tied up or closed and the ladies room said it was out of order.  Fix that shit! People need to wash hands before eating with them."}
{"text":"The food is just okay...the service just as bland. They put the same amount of emphasis on the service as they do the cooking. I had the eggplant parm hero. While it was pretty good, it wasn't worth the almost 15 minute wait, the $10.78, or the attitude I received when I inquired about my order."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza in Charlotte!!! Not to mention the owner and his employees are ALWAYS great!! I order for my work probably monthly and have never had a bad experience!! The are always available to accommodate all my small to large meetings, even last minute. They treat you like family and love to treat you to a yummy slice of pizza!! The pizza is Very good quality!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Charlotte. Great staff that provides excellent service. I recommend the Buffalo Chicken pizza and ask them to cook it \"well done\" I guarantee you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great New York spot, not only do they offer pizza, they offer a variety of stuffed calzones & homemade dishes, lasagna, baked ziti, etc. Upon arriving, the Manager/Owner greeted me and was extremely friendly. Unlike some other pizza joints, Junior's offers a variety of slices, cheese, supreme, white, and so many more. I chose the chicken parmigiana slice with a side salad. The slice was so good!  The dough & crust was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sauce, cheese, and chicken. Loved it! 
Along with the service and taste of the food being top notch, you can enjoy a variety of games on three TVs throughout the restaurant and a tribute to the NY teams mascots painted on the wall. This is a spot that truly shows the owner/family comes from New York!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Ordered a large and it was bigger than they indicated. Tons of cheese and thin crust but crispy.  Nice!"}
{"text":"I walked in and noticed the New York memorabilia and immediately became skeptical.  Ive been to a lot of pizza places outside of NYC that claimed to be NY Style and was sadly disappointed. 

I have to admit I was NOT disappointed at all. One bite and I was back home.  I been back several several times for the specialty pies and chicken parm sandwiches, each one was delicious.  I look forward to the Calzone next time."}
{"text":"Late night dinner after arriving at the airport, I popped into this shopping plaza and it was the lights of Junior's that caught my eye. I was originally thinking that I would get two slices to go (the \"lasagna\" and the \"white\" pizzas in the glass looked good) but as I placed my order, I heard my mouth making \"penne with sausage and peppers\" noises.

I had it to go and when I got home, it was still hot. A very large container with a ton of pasta but also a ton of sauce and sliced peppers and sliced sausage. Absolutely delicious and the three garlic knots that came iwth it allowed me to soak up any leftover sauce.

Next time, I might try the pizza."}
{"text":"These guys have some great pizza!  The little plaza at the intersection of Yorkmont and Oak Lake has become a bit of a dining village with Jersey Mike's, Salsarita's, Nana's, the Hibachi place, and now Junior's.  If you're not in the mood for Yorkmont Cafe, you can probably find something in this little plaza.  But we're talking about the pizza!

Really good  New York-style pizza.  The interior is decorated with TV's and New York sports logos.  I'm happy to report they are Mets fans, and not fans of that other New York baseball team.  The slices are huge and the service is fast.  For work lunch, that's what I'm looking for.  It is a little on the expensive side, but it's good 'za.

They're also open Saturdays till 8:00pm, which is a win for Hyatt Place and Doubletree guests."}
{"text":"I've seen friends come back from lunch with Junior's pizza. They offer slices ready to reheat available. 

I had gone to Juniors with two friends and we decided to sit and stay and order a fresh pepperoni pizza (8 slices). This thing is huge. The fresh pizza is delicious and the cheese is ooey gooey mouth watering. I like how huge each slice is, and how thin the crust is as well. OVerall, good experience, friendly staff and good food!

I know I will be back some time in the future!"}
{"text":"Okay everyone deserves a second chance. Junior's got their's, a $70 pizza order for a team lunch. 

When I ordered they needed me to give them 15 minutes past my ideal pick up time. I rescheduled the team meeting to accommodate them.  

When I arrived at their preferred time. They hadn't even started the order. They offered 15% off if I'd wait just 20 more minutes while they got it going. 

I opted for 100% off and say \"Never again\"."}
