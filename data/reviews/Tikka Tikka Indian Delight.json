{"text":"I had Chicken biriyani, not good at all, waste of money."}
{"text":"Good quality food.  Pay a bit more for the quality and quantity, but worth it!  

We frequent for their lunch combos at 6.99 for vegetarian and 7.99 for non-veg.  It comes with naan, rice, pop, and choice of curries.

We usually  call in advance  for takeout."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just have a craving for South Asian food, but don't feel like gorging at an AYCE place like The Host or something.

Well, I'm pleased to say that my craving was satisfied after I went to this little restaurant at the corner of Markham and 14th Avenue.  I certainly had other choices in the area:  drive a short distance southwards and choose from the array of small food joints in the southeast corner of Markham and Steeles, or go find Babu for some Tamil fare.

I decided to keep it simple.  Oddly enough, the dining room was completely devoid of customers.  it being 6-ish, that wasn't a terribly good sign.  Maybe the weather played a part, I don't know, but that wasn't necessarily an indication of their food quality, so I went ahead and ordered take-out.  The dining area was small and clean, nice lacquered wooden tables, and Indian music playing throughout.

A quick read of the menu revealed a good variety of dishes, although since I was REALLY hungry, i opted for the \"Dinner for Two\" Meat-Special for $26.99 (There is a veggie version for $4 less).  This is a decent deal, as I ended up with the following:

-Indian Green Salad
-2 pcs. of Seekh Kabab (like a mince beef sausage)
-Chicken Tikka Masala
-Chana Masala
-3 (rather large) pieces of Naan
-2 cans of pop
-5 little bowls of some yogurt-based hot sauce (VERY tasty)

Now, the combo was supposed to also have rice and 2 pcs of Pappad.  They had no more pappad, so they substituted another piece of Naan.  Good substitute.

Unfortunately, when I got home, i noticed that they had forgotten to give me the rice!!  I quickly called the restaurant and advised them of this.  The gentleman on the other end apologized and asked if I was going to come back to get it.  I said that  was already home,  so he offered to take my info down and next time he would give me rice for free.  I got his name, of course, but that was a decent move on their part.

Oh right...the FOOD!!  :P  The Chicken Tikka was great.  A little sweet finish, but definitely tasty.  The Chana Masala was hearty and very filling.  The Kabab was a *bit* dry for my taste, but a quick dip in the yogurt hot sauce cured that.  Good taste throughout.  The Naan smelled fresh and tasted even better.

I'm going back here for sure.  They have a bunch of other items that I need to try next time I get my craving, and I'm going to cash in my free rice!!  Great little place for some quick and tasty South Asian food that's definitely a good value for this area of Markham."}
{"text":"This is a solid Indian restaurant.

I usually get the chicken vindaloo, which they serve fairly spicy, but I've had spicier. 

Everything is clean, but it is a basic plaza restaurant, so there's not much in the way of ambiance.

Prices are reasonable and the service is decent,

It loses a star for being unlicensed, since I like beer with Indian food!

If you are unfamiliar with the area, I'll just add that the traffic and parking can be challenging."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and food has always been consistent.  Usually indian restaurants are good and then after few months they lose the quality.  
This has been consistent and has been one of the best indian restaurants in the gta. 
The dishes are flavourful and not watered down.  Everything is made fresh to order and they have some decent lunch specials as well. 
Highly recommended and will frequent the place myself. 
We have tried the butter chicken, lamb karahi, naan, paneer peas, naan, chicken tikka and samosas. 

The seating is comfortable and not too crowded, washrooms could be cleaner."}
{"text":"Having had our US credit card/debit card refused at the Afghan Kebob place in front, we ended up in this small place.
When we entered we were the only customers, however it quickly filled up.

The waiter is helpful but he came back few times to announce that some of the item selected were not available. 

The food was of good quality and worth the wait. The Lassi were all small, portions are not too generous."}
{"text":"Delicious and very consistent quality. :) I love the garlic naan and butter chicken that they have. Its always exactly the same so I never worry about it being too salty or too creamy or anything. 

Service is excellent as well. They are very kind staff and very helpful. They tell you in advance if something has run out and are happy to provide recommendations. 

I would only recommend that they lighten the decor a bit more. I get so slept dining in. :p"}
{"text":"In remembrance of this restaurant, i decided to do a review for old times sake. i'm so disappointed this place closed down. I've been to plenty of indian restaurants but none of them can compare to this one. They were cheap & like how many of the past reviews have said, \"consistent\". Every time i came here, the food always tasted exactly the same. Unlike most indian restaurants, the food was not overly oily or overpowered with too much spices; it was just perfect. i really hope they open a new one. :( rip"}
