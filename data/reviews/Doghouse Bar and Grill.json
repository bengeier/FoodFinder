{"text":"We ordered cheesesteak sandwich with 3 orders of wings to go. Everything was tasty. I'll definitely go back but I'll eat there next time."}
{"text":"I've been to the grill and ordered all kinds of food since I discovered it and everything I've had has been good.  Some of the things I've had were Cheeseburger Sub w/fries, Fish Sub w/fries or onion rings, Salmon burger.  I'll show some pics when I get a chance."}
{"text":"Okay, so the restaurant part of this dive bar is closed at night, apparently. The other side says \"private\" so I turned away to look for food elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go to if you want an awesome sub, wings, or a drink at the full bar."}
{"text":"First off the lady who answered the phone had no professionalism/customer service what so ever. When I got there the lady behind the counter had none either. I ordered 20 wings and was given 6 fries to go with them. See picture posted. Although I like their wings I will never go back! Try to support black business owners and this is what you get."}
